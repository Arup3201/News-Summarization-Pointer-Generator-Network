A handful of states - led by those that enjoy bountiful energy reserves such as West Virginia, Wyoming and North Dakota - have found themselves in enviable positions and oases of optimism at a time of tepid economic recovery.

In an otherwise barren landscape of budget cuts and government layoffs, the questions that sent Alaska lawmakers into special session this year had nothing to do with austerity measures or disagreements over cuts to state agencies or programs. They just couldn't agree on what to do with all that extra money.

The resource-rich state took in nearly $1.9billion more than expected last fiscal year thanks largely to high oil prices and ended the fiscal year with an estimated $260million surplus, an amount equal to nearly four per cent of its general fund.

Meanwhile, a few other states, including Massachusetts, South Carolina and Virginia, have combined slight increases in tax revenue with tight spending controls to produce more modest surpluses.

In West Virginia, the surplus is going
 toward reserves, pension programs and debt. Wyoming put much of the 
extra money into savings after years of investing heavily in roads and 
schools.

And in North Dakota, which is 
experiencing an energy boom similar to the one Wyoming went through 
several years ago, investments included an extra $370million for road 
repair and construction, especially in the oil-producing western part of
 the state. Some $340million will go to schools over the next two years 
to help reduce property taxes, while $22million will go toward a 
disaster relief fund for a state that has been inundated with floods in 
recent years.

At the same time they are saving and 
investing, North Dakota and West Virginia are reducing their corporate 
income tax rates, a move that could make them even more attractive to 
certain businesses.

Unemployment in many of the states 
running surpluses has been well below the national jobless rate of 9.1 
per cent. North Dakota's rate, for example, was 3.5 per cent in 
September.

Alaska labour department economist 
Neal Fried said: 'I don't think you can say we're out of the woods. We 
were never in the woods.'

A yearlong review of fiscal and 
economic data in all 50 states by The Associated Press found 15 states 
with budget surpluses as they headed into the current fiscal year. They 
ranged from Mississippi, where the $6.6million surplus represented less 
than one percent of general fund spending, to Wyoming, where the 
$437million surplus was equivalent to 28 percent of the state's general 
fund.

Massachusetts has benefited from 
stronger-than-anticipated revenue from capital gains taxes to build a 
surplus of just more than one per cent of its general fund budget. It used 
nearly three-quarters of the $460 million surplus to replenish the 
state's reserve fund, while directing other surplus money to cities and 
towns recovering from deadly tornadoes in June, state courts and to 
provide modest raises to social service workers.

Most states have not been so fortunate.

They continue to feel the effects of a
 recession that has led to steep declines in state and local tax 
revenue, with 23 states having to make budget cuts during the last 
fiscal year, according to the National Association of State Budget 
Officers.

In Washington state, for example, the 
Legislature is preparing for a special session to address a $2billion, 
mid-year deficit. The state's Democratic governor has proposed 
eliminating the state's health care program for the poor and a medical 
program for disabled adults. Lower than expected tax revenue in 
California means that state is likely headed for deeper cuts to social 
services and higher education.

Even in Alaska, officials are 
grappling with how to reverse a decades-long trend of declining oil 
production and face a future of reduced federal aid as Congress seeks to
 clamp down on spending, rising Medicaid costs and $11billion in 
unfunded pension liabilities. Governor Sean Parnell acknowledged this in
 making record cuts to an infrastructure spending bill passed by 
lawmakers last spring.

Yet even with those reductions, the 
state wound up with a $2.8billion public works package, the same as the 
year before â€” a spending level Parnell deemed 'healthy'.

Among the state's priorities is 
investing in new roads, schools and energy projects that could help make
 the delivery of heat, electricity and fuel more reliable and 
affordable.

Alaska also is putting $66million 
toward pursuing what would be the largest dam built in the U.S. in 
decades. Officials say the $4.5billion, 700ft high Susitna River dam 
would help meet Alaska's goal of getting half its electricity from 
renewable energy sources by 2025, plus help meet the energy demands of 
the state's most populous region.

The state also plans to spend money on
 transportation projects and upgrades to school buildings, including 
contributing about one-third the cost of a $109million arena at the 
University of Alaska Anchorage. At the same time, Alaska is building the
 nation's largest rainy day fund at $14billion, an amount that is 
roughly double the state's entire general fund.

The governor and legislative leaders also have set aside $400million that could serve as an endowment for college scholarships.

Juneau resident Teddy Castillo said 
such a program would be a huge help to her family. One daughter will 
graduate high school next year and another is a high school freshman.

'I think it's just awesome to have that opportunity available for them,' Mr Castillo said.

In West Virginia, the worldwide demand
 for coal and a conservative approach to government spending have kept 
the state's finances in the black.

Instead of expanding programs, 
lawmakers and governors have devoted about $1billion that was left 
unspent between 2004 and 2008 toward public pension programs and other 
debts. Most of that money eased a shortfall in the main retirement fund 
for teachers.

But one consequence of the state's 
tight-fisted approach has been government on the cheap: West Virginia 
ranks low for teacher and public employee wages despite several rounds 
of pay raises and has among the most restrictive eligibility 
requirements for Medicaid.

Perry Bryant, executive director of 
West Virginians For Affordable Health Care, said: 'If you're a mom with 
two children and you earn more than $6,500 a year, you're not eligible. 
If you're childless, you don't qualify even if you're penniless.'

In Wyoming, which gets most of its 
money from taxes on gas, coal and oil production, investments this year 
included $45million in additional highway money and $15million to try to
 attract large computing centers to the state. The state also has a 
scholarship fund for high school students, similar to what Alaska is 
establishing.

Republican state Senator Phil Nicholas
 doesn't take Wyoming's energy wealth for granted. He remembers seeing 
how the state went from facing a $500million shortfall in the late 1990s
 to being flush with cash thanks to the energy boom that started about 
ten years ago.

While energy production generates more tax revenue, it also can lead to higher ozone levels and other negative consequences.

Mr Nicholas, who is chairman of the 
Senate Appropriations Committee, added: 'Recognizing that price, though,
 Wyoming and our communities are significantly dressed up, if you will.'

He said every town in the state has nicer schools, better parks and other amenities than existed before.

'You'd be hard-pressed to go to any community in this state that has not benefited significantly,' he said.
