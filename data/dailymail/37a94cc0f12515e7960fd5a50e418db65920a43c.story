New deal: Jeremy Clarkson, pictured on his way to the Monaco Grand Prix, has reportedly been handed a new three year contract with the BBC worth £12million, despite anger at his n-word controversy

Jeremy Clarkson could be in line for a new £12million deal with the BBC despite being accused of a string of racist gaffes, it has emerged.

The presenter is said to be in talks over three more years of Top Gear, just weeks after he sparked outrage over his use of the word ‘n*****’ in a TV out-take.

In the clip, Clarkson can be seen swinging a finger between two cars while reciting the rhyme: ‘Eeny, meeny, miny, moe’ before mumbling what sounded like ‘catch a n***** by his toe’.

Reacting to its publication, Clarkson said he was ‘mortified’ and ‘horrified’ when he realised it ‘did appear that I’d actually used the word I was trying to obscure’.

He added: ‘Please be assured I did  everything in my power to not use that word, and I’m sitting here, begging your forgiveness for the fact that obviously my efforts weren’t quite good enough.’

Clarkson, 54, has since claimed to have been warned that he is ‘drinking in the last chance saloon’ by the BBC.

Despite the row, a BBC source yesterday confirmed negotiations were still taking place about his new contract.

'There is no question of Jeremy’s deal not being renewed,' a BBC source told the Sunday People.

'It is being worked on right now. The top executives want him signed up as soon as possible.'

It is thought the new deal – reported to be as high as £12million – would include a £3million annual salary from BBC Worldwide, while an additional £1million would come from the licence fee for each of the three years from 2015 to 2018.

The nursery rhyme row followed an  incident in March, when Clarkson joked that a bridge with an Asian walking across it had ‘a slope on it’.

At the time he was defended by Top Gear producer Andy Wilman, who claimed the presenter was unaware ‘slope’ was an offensive term for Orientals.

Twitter users vented their anger, with one accusing the BBC of giving Clarkson special treatment. ‘Jeremy Clarkson at BBC proves it is OK to be racist as long as you make lots of money,’ they wrote.

Pippa Smith, of pressure group 
Safermedia, said: ‘The BBC should not enter into a further contract with
 him unless he can give a cast iron guarantee he will use responsible 
language that is acceptable to all audiences.’

Clarkson's co-presenters Richard
 Hammond, 44, and James May, 51, who were recently pictured filming with
 Clarkson in Barbados, are also believed to have been offered new deals.

Earlier
 this month it was reported that director of television Danny Cohen had 
allegedly wanted to sack Clarkson, but he was saved by BBC Director 
General Tony Hall following a lengthy meeting over the scandal.

The controversial decision will save the
 corporation millions as the hit show is said to earn in excess of 
£150million a year in revenue - more than any other BBC show.

Top Gear is regularly watched by more
 than five million British viewers, with more tuning in on the 
broadcaster's iPlayer service.

It
 is also shown in the Unites States, Latin America and across Europe, 
and it has been estimated that the show is watched by 350 million 
viewers in 170 countries every week.

In 2012, BBC Worldwide paid £8.4 
million for Clarkson’s stake in a joint venture which had owned the 
commercial rights to Top Gear.

Previously Clarkson received dividends as a co-owner of the company, but he now is understood to receive an annual seven-figure fee from BBC Worldwide, while the corporation owns the rights to the Top Gear brand.

Clarkson's current deal is thought to be worth around £1million a year for his work as a presenter.

After details of the 'n-word' footage emerged an online petition calling for him to be sacked reached more than 1,000 signatures, and Labour figures including deputy leader Harriet Harman and MP Chris Bryant called for him to go.

'Anybody
 who uses the N-word in public or private in whatever context has no 
place in the British Broadcasting Corporation,' Ms Harman wrote on Twitter.

Claims: News of his new contract comes after Clarkson faced calls for him to be sacked after he allegedly used the n-word during an un-aired Top Gear outtake

Remorse: Clarkson issued an apology in which he 'begged for forgiveness' and said he was 'mortified' at the footage

But Education Secretary Michael Gove urged the BBC not to axe Clarkson because he had been 'clear in his apology'.

Clarkson then declared the corporation had forced him to apologise when he did not want to.

He
 said he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again, 
admitting 'not even the angel Gabriel' could survive after the threat - 
especially not a presenter renowned for controversy.

But the 
presenter compared his apology to saying sorry for starting the Syrian 
civil war because they were both things he had not done.

'I've been told by the BBC that if I make one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time, I will be sacked,' he wrote.

Broadcast: The controversy came just weeks after he referred to an Asian man as a 'slope' during an episode of Top Gear

'And even the angel Gabriel would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head.

'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that.'

He also wrote: 'Happily, the BBC had a plan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good one.

'An
 apology is a good idea if you've just spilled some beer down someone's 
shirt...But saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all, and
 hoping the story would die down as a result?'
