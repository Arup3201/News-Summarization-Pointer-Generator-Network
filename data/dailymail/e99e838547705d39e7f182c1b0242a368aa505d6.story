Depraved:Daniel Welsh dragged his victim off the street and threatened to shoot her before raping her. It has now emerged that he was being monitored by police at the time of the attack

A young woman was abducted and repeatedly raped by a high-risk serial sex offender who was being monitored by police.

In a horrifying attack, Daniel Welsh dragged his victim off the street and threatened to shoot her.

Welsh, who had a long history of sex offending, was subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order at the time, having been judged as at ‘very high risk of re-offending’.

He told the 25-year-old woman: ‘Don’t do anything stupid because I am going to shoot you’ before subjecting her to a ‘prolonged, vile and depraved’ ordeal, lasting for 90 minutes.

As Welsh was handed a life sentence yesterday, police chiefs defended their handling of the case after refusing to publish an internal report on the sex offender, claiming it was ‘in the public interest’ to keep it under wraps.

Yesterday, Welsh was handed an Order for Lifelong Restriction (OLR) which means he will only be released from custody once the Parole Board is satisfied that he no longer poses a threat.

Passing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh, Lady Rae described Welsh’s latest attack as ‘prolonged, vile and depraved’ and branded him a ‘serious danger to the public’.

She said: ‘One cannot even imagine the terror this young woman must have suffered. It is clear from the Victim Impact Statement that she has suffered greatly at your hands – the psychological impact on her is incalculable.’

Welsh, 22, pounced on his victim, as she walked to meet a friend in Aberdeen in February this year. The sex offender, a prisoner at HMP Grampian, pleaded guilty to abduction and rape charges at an earlier hearing and sentence had been deferred for reports.

The court heard how he grabbed the woman then forced her to walk with him, saying he just wanted to talk. He took her to a cemetery and raped her. He then forced her to walk to a bird hide, where he raped the victim again.

The court heard that Welsh was a convicted sex offender at the time of the attack and was being monitored by an offender management unit in Aberdeen.

Welsh had twice breached a court order banning him from going near girls aged under 17.

He had been cleared on a legal technicality after police were forced to break into his flat to rescue youngsters there.

When the authorities have failed to prevent a convicted sex offender from striking again, an independent Significant Case Review (SCR) is often commissioned.

However, in Welsh’s latest case, there was none. Instead, local police compiled an internal report– an Initial Case Review (ICR) – into its own handling of Welsh, which is now being kept secret.

Scottish Tory chief whip John Lamont said: ‘The decision by Police Scotland not to reveal the findings of the ICR unhelpfully gives the impression of having something to hide.’

Campaigner Margaret-Ann Cummings, whose eight-year-old son Mark was killed by a sex offender in Glasgow in 2004, said: ‘If Daniel Welsh was deemed “very high risk”, it defies belief for the police to say this crime was impossible to predict.’

A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘The management of sex offenders in the community is a particularly sensitive and complex area of work, and in this instance a review was immediately undertaken by the MAPPA [a set of procedures called Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements] partners in accordance with national guidance.

‘It was concluded that the actions of the authorities were appropriate and could not have predicted the behaviour of Daniel Welsh.

‘Keeping the public safe is always the main priority (but) a balance is required between public safety and the right of the individual.

‘All aspects of cases are carefully considered at every stage of the process, from psychological and risk assessments, to places of residence and potential security issues.’
