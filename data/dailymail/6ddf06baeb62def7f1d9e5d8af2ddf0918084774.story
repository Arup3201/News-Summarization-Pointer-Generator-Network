Golden contract: Cathy Butterworth was given a deal worth £900,000 for just three years' work

A senior police civilian worker was handed a golden contract worth almost £900,000 for just three years' work, it was revealed today.

Cathy Butterworth was head of training and development for Greater Manchester Police on a £87,000 salary.

But she also received a bonus of up to £8,700 a year, a 'termination payment' of more than £200,000 and a £400,000 pension pot when she hits 55.

An internal report has revealed her 'unique' package, with its author admitting the deal was 'particularly well drafted from the employee's perspective'.

The report details the 'unique characteristics' of her contract, which handed Ms Butterworth 10 years' worth of extra contribution into her pension pot.

It was drawn up by her boss Andrew Marston - who himself had just been granted early retirement and a massive pay-off - and signed by David Whatton, the then Deputy Chief Constable of GMP, who went on to become the top officer at Cheshire police.

GMP had considered taking action against now-retired Whatton but the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled he should face no action after hearing he had accepted professional advice.

Ms Butterworth's overall remuneration package following her three years as director of learning and development - when her salary, her estimated £400,000 pension and 'termination' payments are added - amounted to £865,000.

She left in 2011 after the force agreed a significant pay-off, even though GMP was embarking on a savage £134m cost-cutting exercise that would cost 1,500 jobs.

Published accounts for the following year stated the 'termination payment' was £117,413 and GMP bosses insisted at the time it was a routine redundancy pay-off. But the real figure was £204,413 as an additional £87,000 payment was hidden in another section of the accounts, the report confirms.

Ms Butterworth is now assistant head of people strategy at Oldham Council and has been warned 'not to count on' her GMP pension. She has declined to comment.
