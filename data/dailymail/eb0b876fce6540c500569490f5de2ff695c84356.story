When Vanessa Buckley set up her own acting agency she thought her two children would be the first in the limelight.

But in fact it was the family dog which landed a leading role in London Fashion Week.

The Buckley's pet Ebenezer, an eight-year-old blue whippet, made his debut on the catwalk at the glittering London Fashion Week event for luxury brand Mulberry.

But he was not alone in his stage debut as he had 14 pet friends to join him in the forest-themed campaign.

Fashion hounds: Vanessa Buckley set up an acting agency with the intention of making her children famous - but after adding photos of her dogs to the site she found there was a demand for them tooo

Vanessa, of Greetland, West Yorkshire, said: 'I set up my own casting agency Vada after running a drama school for twelve months.

'There is a shortage of agencies in the north and it seemed a natural progression.

'I was just looking online and came across an ad in which they said they were looking for blue whippets for London Fashion Week.

'I have one and so does my friend so I emailed them and sent in their pictures.

'It all went from there. We didn't find out all the details until much nearer the time.

'They asked for the dogs' collar sizes and then we had to sign a secrecy agreement so that gave us an indication it was a big event.

'We were met at Claridges hotel and the dogs were given a run through on the set.

'It was a forest theme so they tested them out with the dry ice and the loud music and photographers and they were absolutely fine with it all.

'It was for the launch of the new Mulberry handbag and the face of the brand Cara Delevingne was on stage with the blue whippets.

'There were 15 in total for the event which was in Claridges' ballroom.

'The dogs all had their own handlers. We realised how serious it was when we tried to leave the set for an hour and couldn't get out for all the paparazzi trying to get in!'

But for now Vanessa is happy for her pet pooch to be signed on the books and he now has a Mulberry collar to show for his efforts.

Vanessa, who lives with her husband Matthew and their two children James, 16, and Lucy, 14, added: 'It's another string to our bow.'
