A grandson was today accused of illegally owning a dangerous dog which killed his grandmother in a savage attack in her home. 

Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard Craig Greve, 23, of Cardiff, was the owner of the American bulldog which was dangerously out of control. 

Rhona Greve, 64, of Ely, Cardiff, suffered 16 bite wounds to her neck and face after the dog - named Solo - attacked her last Friday evening, the court was told.

She later died at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff.

Mr Greve is charged with both having a dog while being banned for life from doing so, and being the owner of a dangerously out of control dog.

He pleaded not guilty to both charges at the magistrates' court hearing today.  

Members of his family and friends were in the public gallery for the hearing which lasted nearly an hour. 

The case has been sent to Cardiff crown court and he was remanded in custody.

Her heartbroken daughter Clare said: 'I got the call to say: "Your mum's been savaged by a dog".

'It all happened so quickly. When I arrived at hospital she was already gone.

'They asked me if I wanted to see her body but I didn't have the heart. I didn't want to see her like that.

She added: 'She was a brilliant mum and she didn't deserve to go like that. I can only imagine what Craig is going through right now. He must be devastated.

'We're all waiting to find out more about what has happened. You just never expect something like this.'  

Officers were called to the home in Ely shortly after 10pm on Friday to reports that a 64-year-old woman had suffered serious injuries

The court heard how grandson Greve lived with his grandmother - and was brought up 'like her own child'.

She took him in when his mother Amanda, 40, had a stroke at a 'very young age'.  

Greve told police how he returned home to find the American bulldog standing above his grandmother in the kitchen.

Prosecutor Katy McMahon said: 'As a result of the dog being out of control, it has caused harm to Rhona Greve resulting in her death.

'She sustained significant injuries and died later in hospital.'

Police were called by neighbours and the court heard officers said the dog was 'snarling with blood on its teeth.'

Miss McMahon said: 'Officers described the dog as going beserk.'

His lawyer Trudy McBride said: 'This is an extremely tragic case. He is the grandson of the deceased. He saw what happened and was with her when she passed away.'

Rhona had been a full-time carer for her husband Malcolm as he battled lung disease emphysema. 

After his death more than five years ago Rhona loved the American bulldog keeping her company.

A friend said: 'She loved that dog and he kept her company. We can't think what happened to make Solo turn like that.'

Another said: 'She was a real lover of people and their pets. She loved having people around and their pets too.'  

Rhona had four children - three daughters and a son who died at a young age. She also had 21 grandchildren.  

Flowers and tributes have been laid at the house which has now been taped off by police.

Local councillor Susan Goddard said: 'This is a terrible tragedy, it's just too awful to comprehend. It's terrible.'  

A 17-year-old boy who was also arrested in connection with the incident has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. 

Supt Andy Valentine of South Wales Police's eastern division said: 'This is tragic incident, which I know will shock and upset the local community.

'The woman's family are understandably extremely distressed and are being supported by specially trained police officers.'

Supt Valentine reassured local residents it was an 'isolated incident'. 

According to NHS data, as of 2014 there have been 4,263 admissions to hospitals in Wales from dog attacks since 1999.  

In February last year, six-day-old baby Eliza-Mae Mullane from Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, died from a serious head injury after being attacked by a dog.
