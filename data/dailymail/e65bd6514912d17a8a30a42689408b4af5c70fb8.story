Britain’s stormy weather wasn’t bad news for these daredevil surfers who risked their lives to ride a 24ft wave nicknamed 'The Widow Maker'.

The wall of water - called The Cribbar - is known as the UK’s biggest wave and was whipped up by 60mph winds.

It is created when low pressure systems in the Atlantic trigger huge swells which rise up as they pass over a rocky shelf called the Cribbar Reef off Newquay, Cornwall.

The Cribbar phenomenon happens just a handful of times every winter between September and April.

The 24ft wall of water smashed onto Newquay’s Fistral Beach on Wednesday around 1pm amid Britain’s stormy weather - but it has been known to reach up to 30ft.

The Cribbar is actually a short series of waves which have earned the nicknames ‘The Widow Maker’ and ‘The Bone Cruncher’ because of the extreme danger of riding them.

Some surfers use 'waist high', 'head high', 'shoulder high' and 'over head' as an indicator of wave height.

Others measure the wave face from peak to trough - from the bottom to the top 
of the breaking wall of water, but it is often difficult to work this out exactly. 

The other way to measure waves is 'from the back'  - known as Hawaiian Style - which translates to around half of the wave face height. For example a 3ft wave would be considered 6ft wave on this scale.

The term 'from the back' relates to when the wave starts to break. It draws water from the shore so that wave trough in the front drops below the average sea level, making the face bigger than the back.

Despite the danger local surfers Ben Skinner and Tom Butler surfed the wave when it crashed in this week.

The amazing photos were taken by local photographer Geoff Tydeman.

He said: 'The Cribbar started coming in with low tide about 1.10pm and lasted a couple of hours until mid tide.

'The surfers are taken out on jet-skis so it takes a while to catch each wave. There was a crowd of people watching them.

'It is thrilling to watch. These guys are riding the biggest waves Britain has to offer.'

The
Cribbar is considered to be the UK’s biggest wave spot and is well 
renowned for its volatility, ferocity and power and is only to be taken 
on by professionals.

The wave became the stuff of legend back in 1966 when three visiting Australian surfers stumbled upon the waves.

Ever since experienced surfers from across the globe have come to take on the challenge.

Outlook: The weather looks set to improve as the weekend approaches and the rain will recede

Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has
warned people in coastal areas to be vigilant and to expect higher 
tides than normal after the gale force winds.

James Humphrys, area manager, said 'We are receiving regular weather 
updates from the Met Office, continuously monitoring both tidal 
conditions and river levels and have had officers out overnight checking
flood defences and closing flood gates.

'People should be aware that there 
could be a lot of water in coastal areas, so avoid trying to drive or 
walk through any flood water and be sensible when out and about, 
particularly around the coast.

'Now is a good time for anyone who lives 
in an area vulnerable to flooding to think about the precautions they 
can take to protect their properties.'

A
girl had a lucky escape yesterday evening at Porthleven, Cornwall. The 
teenager was hit by a huge 30ft wave which hit the harbour wall 
approaching high tide.

The girl was unharmed but had a stiff talking to by locals after paying no notice to the warning signs.

Meanwhile, in storm-battered Sussex five 
houseboat owners were rescued after one vessel began tipping over in the
Surrey Boat Yard in Shoreham making the gangway for four other boats 
unstable.

The houseboat owners were led to 
safety at 3am this morning by Shoreham firefighters and Sussex Police, 
and spent the rest of the night huddled in the nearby coastguard station
at Humphreys Gap.

More coastal flooding hit Emsworth 
and Bosham after a huge spring tide of nearly 20ft surged over the sea 
defences and left roads and car parks submerged.

Water started to pour into the Anchor
Bleu, in High Street, Bosham, shortly before 1pm and rose up to six 
inches in some parts of the pub.

The car park of Bosham Sailing Club 
was under two feet of water, and The Quay in Emsworth has been flooded 
with some cars parked in nearly a foot of water.

In land, torrential rain overnight caused havoc on the roads in the south leaving many virtually impassable.

The Thames Valley was particularly badly affected, and in Hampshire drivers were warned not to remove 'road closed' signs and risk their lives by trying to get across a swollen ford.
