FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert caught the governing body by surprise with his vow to make public next month significant parts of the Garcia report into World Cup bidding corruption.

Zurich had been briefing up to last Thursday night that Eckert’s November statement would be nothing more than a progress report on his study of Michael Garcia’s findings about the flawed 2018 and 2022 votes.

But Eckert told FIFA.com that the ‘statement will contain an overview of the investigation report, a summary of the main findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report, as well as a brief evaluation of the same’.

The differing stances demonstrate at least that Eckert’s adjudicatory chamber are acting independently of the FIFA executive, who have not seen any of the four copies of Garcia’s findings. It is thought Eckert will recommend charges are brought against a double-digit number of personnel involved in the bids but not that the World Cup be taken away from Qatar.

The full Garcia report will not be published to protect witness confidentiality and for legal reasons. Garcia, as an American citizen, did not investigate the Russia and USA bids.

Manchester United coach Nicky Butt told guests at the HMV Football Extravaganza this week that he and his Class of 92 colleagues don’t particularly like being bracketed with that name. But that hasn’t stopped them exploiting it commercially for all its worth.

Emirates, the only one of FIFA’s six top-tier sponsors not to comment on the need for an inquiry after the allegations around corrupt World Cup bidding, are said to be wavering on whether to continue their backing in Russia in 2018. The Dubai-based airline are believed to have worries about FIFA’s battered image. Sources say FIFA’s finance committee are aware of Emirates’ concerns. An Emirates spokesperson said: ‘We do not comment on rumours or speculation.’

FA performance chief Dave Reddin produced his 2003 Rugby World Cup winner’s medal to show the FA board before beginning his recent presentation about the way forward for the England team. However, the directors shouldn’t have been too impressed with the backroom staff gong because even the media man received one in Sydney before famously doing a jig on the podium. Reddin’s plan is to bring in an array of world-class sports scientists to produce key marginal gains. FA chairman Greg Dyke told council this was ‘not the cheapest option’.

The shambles of the FA not having a single representative from their doomed international committee in Croatia for the England Under 21 match, revealed by Sports Agenda, was raised in last week’s council meeting and described as a ‘disgrace’ by respected councillor Jack Pearce among others.

The less-than-helpful reply to Pearce from David Gill, who now has overall command of the marginalised International Committee in his role as chairman of the Professional Game Board, was: ‘We can’t have the agenda of the FA being dictated by Charles Sale.’

Gill was also responsible for the bizarre decision to make Ivor Beeks, a vice-president of Wycombe Wanderers, a Premier League representative on the International Committee after he was kicked off by the Football League.

The PL and FL remain flummoxed by Gill’s decision but getting a first-hand explanation is difficult because Gill usually only deigns to talk to the press when he has an election to win.

Martin Slumbers, the investment banker chosen as the new R&A chief executive, has been such a low-key member of Worplesdon Golf Club in Surrey that a number of long-time regulars profess never to have seen him.

The FIFA ethics commission’s ludicrous fuss over the return of the £16,400 Parmigiani watches gifted by Brazil’s football federation to World Cup delegates is put in perspective by Manchester United’s Tom Cleverley, now on loan at Aston Villa. He sold his personalised United sponsors Hublot No 23 watch to a Blackpool dealer, who is now asking £17,500 for it.
