CCTV cameras captured the moment Britain's most wanted drug baron met up with two other criminal kingpins to discuss a cocaine and heroin smuggling network which 'spanned the globe'.

Kevin Hanley - described as the 'top, top man' in the drugs world - met up with Merseyside dealer Richard Harrison and Scottish 'fixer' Matthew Edward at a bar in Liverpool in November 2012.

It was a meeting that would be the start of their downfall and all three are now behind bars after Kevin Hanley - along with his girlfriend Chrysi Minadaki and 'right-hand man' John Fowler - were jailed earlier this month following Harrison and Edward's conviction last November.

Two separate arms of the National Crime Agency (NCA) were on the tail of different members of the trio when they met up two years ago, but investigators at that point were not sure of their connections.

An agent from the organisation has since described the meeting as a 'eureka moment' when it emerged the men's activities were linked and the full scale of their empire was revealed.

Hanley had set up an international trafficking ring using a wholesale food business in London's Covent Garden market as a front for the transportation of Venezuelan cocaine by lorry from southern Europe to Britain, hiding £5million of cocaine inside watermelons and pomegranates.

He started the enterprise after his former boss, Irish-born career-criminal Brian Brendon 'The Milkman' Wright, was jailed for 30 years.

Hanley met up with Harrison, 58, and Edward, 49, at the Restaurant Bar and Grill in Liverpool in a moment described as a breakthrough by the NCA.

An NCA agent told the Liverpool Echo: 'Our surveillance brought us both independently to the bar in Liverpool and it was the first time we realised the link between the two parties. It was a eureka moment where the two investigations suddenly became one.

'They all thought they were untouchable but their coming together in Liverpool that day proved to be the catalyst to their downfall.'

Harrison and Edward were later snared after British police tipped off Italian authorities to a shipment of 35kg of heroin concealed in breadsticks in a Scottish lorry later that month.

Hanley, 52, and Minadaki, 45, went on the run in Greece for eight months but were eventually arrested while watching the British and Irish Lions play Australia in an Irish bar in the country in 2013.

Harrison was also caught on CCTV meeting  Hanley at a Reading FC football match in late 2012

Around £2 million in cash was found stuffed in suitcases when John Fowler's flat in Chelsea was raided

Investigators also found cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis worth almost £3 million at the property

Hanley and Minadaki were this month both jailed for 17 years at the Old Bailey in London for drugs supply offences.

Mathew Edward, of Glasgow, was jailed for six years, 10 months in Glasgow last year and Richard Harrison, of Liverpool, was handed a five and a half year sentence.

John Fowler, 58, who used his fruit and veg firm as a front for the drug smuggling enterprise was jailed for 16 years.

Brendan Foreman, NCA regional head of investigations, said: 'For all the high end technology we used to narrow down the search for him, it was good old fashioned policing that led investigators to a bar in Greece, after they correctly predicted Hanley's love of rugby made him vulnerable and he would not be able to resist coming out of hiding to watch a crucial Lions match.

'The evidence against Hanley was overwhelming and his decision to plead guilty ultimately led to a significant prison sentence and the disruption of an international crime network that truly spanned the globe.'

The men met at the upmarket 'Restaurant Bar and Grill' in Liverpool in 2012, not knowing two sections of the National Crime Agency were on their tails

The meeting has been described as a 'eureka moment' by an investigation insider, who says it confirmed the trio were in business together in a network that 'spanned the globe'
