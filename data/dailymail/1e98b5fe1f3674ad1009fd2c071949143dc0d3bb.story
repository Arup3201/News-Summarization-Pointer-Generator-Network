A New York  couple decided against a fancy wedding and tropical honeymoon and have opted instead to spend the last two years traveling from state to state performing random acts of kindness.

Mark and Ismini Svensson of Orangeburg are going to all 50 states, in fact, as they help the sick, homeless and disadvantaged in some small but meaningful way.

The couple have thus far made their journey car, train, bus and plane. They've fittingly dubbed it '50 acts of giving back.'

Helping out: A New York State couple have spent the last two years going state to state in order to do a good deed in each

Keeping it simple: Mark and Ismini Svensson of Orangeburg, New York have been on the road for two years. They decided to forego a fancy wedding in order to bankroll their helping of others

'We both realized what really made us happy was helping people in need,' Ismini Svensson told CNN.

Mrs. Svensson's father helped to inspire the trip. He died suddenly while attending a charity event.

In between visiting a lonely terminal cancer patient in a North Carolina hospital and helping out at the Humane Society in Pensacola among their other acts, the couple have started a family.

Their 16-month-old daughter has hit the road with them as they finish out the journey.

StayUNITED: The Svenssons have become so popular that fans have sent them money. They've always planned to pay their own way, so they used the money to start their own non-profit

Along for the ride: The Svenssons have somehow found time to start a family--their 16-month-old daughter goes where they go

Ismini credits her father for inspiring the trek. He died suddenly while attending a charity funcion

'The message is everyone can do something to make a difference, even in their own communities, even if it's a compliment to someone,' Mark said. 'You never know the impact it may have on another person'

The couple's most memorable moment was visiting this dying woman's hospital room in North Carolina. She told them she'd been praying for a miracle before they showed up with flowers and gifts

The Svenssons always intended to foot the bill for their own trip, but the cause has won them many fans who can't help but send a helpful donation their way.

So the couple put the money to good use by starting their own non-profit.

Called Stay United, the organization is geared toward helping children in Svensson's native New York.

'The message is everyone can do something to make a difference, even in their own communities, even if it's a compliment to someone,' Mark told CNN. 'You never know the impact it may have on another person.'

So what's up next for the couple? They have just a few more stops in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest to go. 

Then it's off to Alaska before their journey culminates in sunny Hawaii.

What's next: The couple is almost done with their journey. They're moving on toward final destinations in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest before going to Alaska and, finally, Hawaii
