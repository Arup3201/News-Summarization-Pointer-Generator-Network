It is little wonder that the record-breaking alligator killed last weekend in Alabama tipped the scales at over 1,000lbs.

When the behemoth reptile snagged Saturday by Mandy Stokes and her extended family was sliced open, taxidermist Ken Owens discovered inside the animal's stomach a fully intact adult female deer and a smattering of other animal bones.

The doe, which had been swallowed whole by the monster gator, was likely 3 years old and weighing more than 100lbs, according to the Autaugaville taxidermist. 

The 15-foot-long, 1,015-pound alligator was hooked in a creek about 80 miles west of Montgomery August 16, possibly setting a new world record.

Bottomless pit: The massive animal killed by Mandy Stokes and her family last weekend had swallowed the doe whole a week earlier, along with two squirrels  

The critter was bagged by Mandy and John Stokes, brother-in-law Kevin Jenkins and his children, 16-year-old Savannah and 14-year-old Parker.

The clan have brought their scaly catch to Mr Owens to skin and stuff it so it could ultimately be put on public display.

The taxidermist laid out the gargantuan gator measuring 70.5 inches around the stomach on the floor of a large work shed and cut open its midsection, which turned out to contain the badly deteriorated deer corpse.

Owens told Al.com the dead doe had no hair, owing to alligators’ powerful stomach acid, but much of the cartilage and all four hooves were intact.

The taxidermist, who performed the so-called necropsy on the gator at the request of biologists, estimated that the reptile must have wolfed down the doe about a week before its fateful encounter with the Stokes-Jenkins family.

The alligator's belly yielded a few additional surprises, including two complete squirrel carcass still covered in patches of fur.

Feast: The massive reptile has yielded a couple hundred pounds of meat, some of which will go to charity 

Trophy: The gator's will go to a tannery, and it will be fully mounted by next spring

Dr. Kent Vliet, a reptilian biologist with the University of Florida, told Al.com it remains a mystery to him how exactly the 1,000-pound gator went about capturing the small woodland critters.

‘I've looked at the stomach contents of a lot of alligators and have never seen a squirrel in any of them,’ he told the newspaper.

Vliet speculated that the animals may have fallen into the river during a storm and ended up in the gator’s maw.

Other items that Ken Owens discovered while rummaging through the contents of the slain gator's belly included bones from a water bird; skull plates from other deer; big rocks; molars from a small cow, and a heaping portion of greenery.

In all, the taxidermist spent more than 2 hours skinning the hulking beast and sawing off its head. The gator likely will not be mounted until next spring.

The massive carcass of the gator also yielded several hundred pounds of edible meat, some of which will go to charity. 

The  beast was captured by five members of the Stokes family near Thomaston early Saturday.

It took the family, consisting of Mandy Stokes, husband John Stokes, brother-in-law Kevin Jenkins and his children Savannah, 16, and Parker, 14, ten hours to capture the monster.

The hunt started on Friday night and lasted well into Saturday morning.

 Mandy Stokes said her crew went through the full range of emotions as they first staked the animal,  before battling it, then killing it and finally struggling to take it back to shore.

And the fierce gator didn't go down without a fight. After the family got some large hooks into the gator, Mandy Stokes aimed her 20-gauge shotgun at the ‘sweet spot’ behind the alligator's eyes.

That's where she was told to aim during a mandatory training class for Alabama gator hunters.

She pulled the trigger, but the gator's head was too far beneath the water's surface.

‘All it did was make this gator mad,’ Mandy Stokes told Al.com. ‘Fear had taken hold at this point."

The gator surged forward and towed the 17-foot boat and its five passengers across the creek at a startling speed, the hunters said.

The towing continued until the boat crashed into a tree stump in the creek, sending the crew spilling on top of each other.

Eventually, Mandy Stokes got another shot.

‘He came up just as calm as he could,’ Mandy Stokes told AL.com. ‘When I pulled the trigger this time, water just exploded on all of us.’

They tied the gator to one side of the boat and hugged the opposite side so it wouldn't tip over as they made an hour-long trek back to their truck. 

When they finally got the beast back to dry land, he was so big that he crushed the winch system normally used by Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries biologists.

Alligators are the only dangerous-game species that can legally be hunted in Alabama

The Stokes' gator measured 70.5 inches around the stomach, 46 inches around the base of the tail and had a 16-inch snout measurement

Alligators are the only dangerous-game species that can legally be hunted in the state. In the end, a backhoe had to be brought in to lift the animal and officially weigh it.

The mammoth gator has now been officially named as the largest ever legally harvested in Alabama and it could even be a new world record.

In June, Safari Club International declared a 14-foot, 8-inch, 880-pound alligator killed in Chalk Creek near Lufkin, Texas by Justin Wells of Bossier City, La., in 2007 as the new world record.

It isn't clear which metric - length, weight or a combination of both - SCI used to come to its decision.

The Stokes' gator measured 70.5 inches around the stomach, 46 inches around the base of the tail and had a 16-inch snout measurement.

Following his capture and being weighed, his next stop was scheduled to be Ken Owens' Autaugaville taxidermy shop.
