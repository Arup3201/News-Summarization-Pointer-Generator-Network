My name is Wendy. I am 56 years old. And I cannot swim. Worse, I am petrified of water. There. I’ve said it.

That’s why I felt a twinge of sadness earlier this month when I read that nearly half of British children will leave school unable to swim. I can only hope their lives won’t be blighted as mine has been.

There is a reason for this fear. When I was five, at a summer camp in Bournemouth, my parents went for a walk, while I played on the beach with children from the camp.

I decided to paddle out into the sea, but my father, spotting his small child from afar, raced across the sand, yanking me violently from the water. I screamed in shock.

At that moment, my lifelong fear of water was born. No matter how hard I tried, or how much money was invested in swimming lessons, I never got over it.

Years later, I learned why my father behaved as he did. When he and my mother lost my older brother in a cot death, my father had to go to the morgue — and there saw the tiny body of a child who had drowned. He was so traumatised by the sight, compounding his grief for my brother, that he was forever after petrified that I would drown.

As an older child, I spent most summers learning to swim — and failing spectacularly. My stepfather would patiently stand over me as I struggled. I was given every opportunity: he taught me on holiday in the shallow water of the beautiful island of Rab, Croatia, and paid for lessons in a luxury hotel spa.

I couldn’t even conquer my fear when a hunky South American took great pains to teach me in a Miami swimming pool in the complex where I was then living.

Beach holidays were ruined. Even walking alongside a canal brought a twinge of fear, in case I slipped and couldn’t stay afloat.

I simply gave up. By the time I hit 50, I had long since resigned myself to being unable to swim and spent holidays reading by the pool, done up in a bikini, but dry as a bone.

Sobering statistics, such as there being 400 drowning deaths a year, made me unwilling to even dangle my feet in the water.

But every so often, I’d get a nagging feeling. Was my failure to learn a sign of weakness? I’d always been proud of my ability to conquer adversity. This had defeated me.

Then I read about Jan Jordan, of Aqua Vie, who has a revolutionary way of teaching swimming: the Shaw Method.

Named after Steven Shaw, the former competitive swimmer who devised it 25 years ago, it uses the principles of body awareness and natural balance to radically change a pupil’s relationship with water.

While most swimming lessons are adapted for children or adults, this method is purely for grown-ups, so it’s especially good for those with a long-held fear. It’s based on the Alexander Technique, a way of correcting posture, which is usually taught on land and is particularly popular with City workers suffering from the stresses of bad posture.

Celebrity aficionados of the Alexander Technique include John Cleese and Sarah Ferguson. But in water, I’m told, it works just as well, transforming the body’s reaction to water — and the mind’s, too. Could this finally be my answer?

LESSON ONE

I meet Jan in a heated, shallow pool in the Pestana Chelsea Bridge Hotel, London. Although I’m assured I will never be out of my depth, I am terrified. I start by kicking off from the pool wall (one of the few things I’ve managed to learn over the years), but Jan immediately stops me. Apparently, that’s a bad habit.

Instead, she shows me how to start with both feet on the ground, so I don’t wobble or feel out of control. She is perfectly nice about it, but I feel like a schoolgirl being ticked off. And then — disaster! — I make the most basic of errors by taking a deep breath before putting my face in the water.

‘That’s a common mistake by beginners,’ says Jan. ‘All that breath makes you too buoyant, as you have too much air in your mouth.’

I’m aware of how pathetic I seem, but am determined to persevere.

When I’m running out of breath, Jan tells me to drop my nose down, put my feet on the bottom of the pool and stick my head out of the water. I follow her advice and glide a foot or two — which, to my surprise, I find easy. I haven’t panicked at all and leave thrilled.

LESSON TWO

Today, we do everything again, but this time, as I am doing my underwater glide it suddenly dawns on me that I’m doing it, and I stop out of terror, swallow a mouthful of water, and come up spluttering.

My nerves have got the better of me. I feel sick with frustration. But Jan remains upbeat. ‘You’re getting calmer in the water and I think you are making progress,’ she says.

LESSON THREE

This time, Jan tells me to try to glide on one side, then the other. I hate every second of it. I feel as if I am sinking and drowning. Now I really have hit a wall.

Jan asks whether I’ve ever had any kind of health issue to do with balance. I remember a terrible bout of labyrinthitis, an acute inner-ear infection, when I was 19.

‘That explains everything,’ she says. ‘You have the memory of a traumatic event and, when you turn sideways, that triggers it and terrifies you.’

She concludes it will take a huge amount of time for me to overcome this and master the side crawl.

Instead, we decide I should try to learn the ‘Old-Fashioned Back Crawl’. I’m to start in ‘the armchair position’: knees bent, arms resting on the surface in front of me.

‘Then, when you lean back to do the backstroke, you will go into a pendulum swing, which means you move down into the water, and your hips go back,’ says Jan.

It sounds frightening, but I do it. Within seconds, I find myself on my back, staring at the ceiling — a triumph! Then, just as I’m starting to believe I’ve got it nailed, I feel myself toppling to one side.

Jan tells me that if I move my eyes around, I’ll automatically become unstable, so my gaze must be fixed to one point. I follow her advice and, with her hand supporting me lightly, float the length of the pool.

LESSON FOUR

We go to a different pool, with a temperature of 31 degrees, which means my muscles will relax.

Jan spends the lesson giving me Water Shiatsu — a subtle form of massage manipulation excellent for loosening the spine and replacing bad memories of water with good.

She holds my head in the crook of her arm, supports my shoulders and legs while afloat and slowly turns my body. I’m not sure how this is helping me swim, but it’s so relaxing, I almost fall asleep!

LESSON FIVE

We discover a problem. As I’m a writer, and spend hours at the computer, the muscles in my arm are shorter than most. As a result, I have difficulty stretching my arms out fully in the water — no good for performing actual strokes.

Jan’s solution is to imagine I’m holding on to a bar in front of me. Amazingly, this simple visualisation changes everything. ‘It really is all about your thoughts,’ she says.

Rather than flail and panic, I’m using my brain to understand my movements. It’s a revelation.

I build on it. By the end of my seventh lesson, I manage to swim four lengths, unaided, on my back. I’ve never felt more proud.

At last, in my fifth decade, I can swim. I may not be winning medals, but I know next time I’m on holiday, I won’t be sitting at the side of the pool, but slipping into the water.

And, who knows, maybe I’ll even swim a few lengths.
