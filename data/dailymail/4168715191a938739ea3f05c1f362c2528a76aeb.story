Jeremy Hunt has said he will back a call for parents to be banned from smoking in cars containing children

The controversial move to ban smoking in cars carrying children has won the backing of the Health Secretary.

Jeremy Hunt says there is a compelling case for outlawing smoking when youngsters are in a vehicle.

Critics claim the amendment to the Children and Families Bill, approved by the House of Lords last week, is unenforceable and an extension of the nanny state.

And Mr Hunt had previously rejected Labour’s proposed change in the law, saying it was not the Government’s place to dictate what people did in private places.

But the father of two has changed his mind over regulations that would make it an offence for a driver to ‘fail to prevent smoking in the vehicle when a child or children are present’, with parents who defy the ban facing a £60 fine.

The Government opposed it in the Lords but David Cameron has since said he would look again at the issue.

The call for the new law has been led by Labour public health spokesman Luciana Berger.

It was initially opposed by her boss, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, who says he has changed his mind for the sake of his children.

MPs will be given a free vote when the  Bill returns to the Commons. Many  Liberal Democrats – including Nick  Clegg – remain opposed.

Campaigners  welcomed the Lords vote, claiming a ban would protect half a million children who are exposed to second-hand smoke in cars every week.

The Deputy Prime Minister, who has struggled to give up smoking, argued that the law would ‘subcontract responsible parenting to the state’.

Parents who defy the ban would face a £60 fine.

The policy was a step closer to becoming law when peers voted lat week to pass an amendment to the Children and Families Bill which was about ‘protecting children’.

The Labour move was backed by 222 votes to 197, a majority of 25, in the House of Lords.

Campaigners welcomed the result of the Lords’ vote, claiming a ban would protect half-a-million children who were exposed to second-hand smoke in cars every week.

The toxic fumes deployed from smoking in a care are 11 times more concentrated than lighting up in an open space.

If the law is introduced, it will see smokers fined £60 if they are caught lighting up in a vehicle with a child

A Department of Health survey found 300,000 children a year visited GPs in England every year with problems linked to second-hand smoke.

Passive smoking is linked to respiratory infections such as pneumonia and chest infections in youngsters.

It can also trigger asthma attacks in sufferers and contribute to sudden unexpected infant death.

Last year, the then public health minister Anna Soubry said she would back a ban on smoking in cars on ‘child welfare’ grounds.

Despite the government’s opposition to a ban at the time, Miss Soubry told a local government conference: ‘I would ban smoking in cars where children are present.

‘I would do that for the protection of children. I believe in protecting children. I would see it as a child welfare issue.

‘I think it is something we should at least consider as government.’

Miss Soubry, who is a former smoker herself and now a defence minister, made it clear she was expressing her own views.

Critics have warned that a ban on smoking in private cars is a sign that the ‘nanny state’ is overreaching itself and it could lead to outlawing cigarettes in family homes.
