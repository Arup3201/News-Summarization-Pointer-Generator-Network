A police officer is being investigated after being caught on video abusing his K-9 dog.

The officer, from Hammond, Indiana, was filmed during a traffic stop after he and his dog were called to the scene to search a car for drugs.

The video, filmed by a civilian in a nearby home, shows an unidentified officer hitting the dog with the leash and dragging him up and hanging him in mid-air.

The officer, who has since been placed on administrative leave, was seen whipping the dog and holding him up by the scruff of the neck

The video was posted YouTube on April 30 with the comment: 'Hammond cops abuses K9 unit and slaps dog with leash and lifts dog by throat.'

Outraged viewers posted comments below, calling the police officer an 'utter scumbag' and 'damn monster'.

In a statement, Hammond police department said: 'The Department has observed behavior by the K-9 handler that appears
 to be inconsistent with acceptable training guidelines.'

The officer has been placed on administrative leave. It is unclear if he is being paid while on leave.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the K-9 Unit of the Hammond Police Department.

Four of the dogs in the K-9 unit are trained to detect narcotics and two are trained to detect explosives.

The police's website states that 'training is major part of the duties of a K-9 Team'.
