A Tibetan protester in monk's robes doused himself with gasoline, set himself ablaze and chanted anti-China slogans as he ran down a street in Nepal's capital this morning.

His demonstration outside the Buddhist holy site, the Boudhanath stupa, is the latest in a string of self-immolations protesting China's rule over Tibet.

Witnesses in Nepal said the man entered a cafe in Kathmandu's Boudhanath district - home to many 
Tibetan Buddhist temples and monasteries - and asked to use the 
bathroom.

Street protest: The man has yet to be identified, but appeared to be about 21 years old - he is currently in hospital

After spending some time there, he went onto the street and lit himself on fire. 

He
ran a few steps, covered in flames and chanting slogans against China, 
before collapsing in front of the mammoth Boudhanath stupa, one of the 
holiest Buddhist sites in the world, surrounded by prayer wheels and 
decorated with colourful streams of prayer flags.

The site is centre of Tibetan culture in Kathmandu and has become a focal point for tourists to visit.

The dramatic protest marked the 101st
time since 2009 that a Tibetan monk, nun or layperson has set 
themselves on fire, according to officials from the Tibetan exile 
government, based in India.

Boudhanath Stupa is the largest stupa in Nepal and the holiest Tibetan Buddhist temple outside Tibet.

For centuries it has been regarded as the most important landmark along the Tibet-Kathmandu trade route.

It is the centre of Tibetan culture in Kathmandu and rich in Buddhist symbolism.

It is also a popular tourist site and many regard it as the national symbol for Nepal.

The holy site attracts pilgrims from all over the world.

In 1979, Boudha became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Prayer services are held in the stupa and surrounding gompas and when the sun sets, the whole community comes out and a religious observance is held around the stupa.

The
protesters are calling for Beijing to allow greater religious freedom 
and the return from exile of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who
lives in India.

Tibetan exiles say 99 of the protesters set themselves alight in ethnic Tibetan areas inside China.

Another man died after setting himself on fire last March in the Indian capital of New Delhi.

Police official Keshav Adhikari said police and residents were able to put out the flames and rush the man to a hospital. 

Dozens of police in riot gear surrounded the hospital where the man lay in critical condition.

Adhikari said the man had yet to be identified, but appeared to be about 21 years old.

Wednesday
marked the third and one of the most important days of the Losar 
festival, which is celebrated by the Tibetan community. Many Tibetans in
Nepal visit Boudhanath for the event.

Prasant
Tamang, a waiter at the Golden Eye Cafe, said he found a gasoline 
bottle, a jacket and a bag in the cafe's bathroom.

Tamang said the man 
appeared normal and calm.

'He looked like the hundreds of 
Tibetans who came to Boudhanath today and I did not suspect he was going
to set himself on fire,' Tamang said.

Penpa
Tsering, speaker of the Tibetan exile parliament in India, said that 
with China cracking down on self-immolations inside Tibet, Tibetans were
beginning to move their protests to other countries.

'It's unfortunate, and each life is 
precious, but regular modes of protest are taken away from Tibetans, and
they are expressing their discontent in this extreme way,' he said.

Thousands of Tibetan exiles live in Nepal and occasionally protest against China.

The
Nepalese government has banned such demonstrations, saying it cannot 
allow any activities against friendly nations to take place in Nepal.

Nepal also allows Tibetans to pass 
through Nepal, traveling from their homeland to Dharmasala, India, where
the Dalai Lama lives and the government in exile is based.

Communist troops occupied the Himalayan region of Tibet in 1951.

Beijing says it has been part of China for centuries, but Tibetans say it was independent for much of that time.

The Dalai Lama fled the region in 1959 as Chinese troops crushed protests against communist rule.
