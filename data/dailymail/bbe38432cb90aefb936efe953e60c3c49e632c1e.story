A solid gold Rolex watch given to Second World War leader Dwight D. Eisenhower for helping save Europe from the Nazis is set to become the world's most expensive after it emerged for sale.

The 18-carat timepiece is said to be the most historically significant ever made by the renowned Swiss watchmakers. It is tipped to sell for well over $970,000 when it is auctioned for the first time in Boston tomorrow.

The watch was gifted to American military mastermind Eisenhower by Rolex in 1951, seven years after he successfully led the Allied forces in the D-Day landings.

Rolex made the timepiece and engraved it with Eisenhower's initials along with five stars, symbolising Eisenhower's rank as General, and the date he was appointed Supreme Commander of NATO.

It was the 150,000th made by Rolex - Winston Churchill had been presented with the 100,000th while the 50,000th had gone to Swiss army general Henry Guisan.

The watch became Eisenhower's favourite and two years after receiving it he wore it into the White House where he was appointed the 34th President.

Just before his death in 1969, Eisenhower gave the Rolex Oyster Perpetual DateJust watch to his long-serving aide Sergeant John Moaney, who had been by his side during the war. He had also lived in the White House with him.

Before his death in 1969, Eisenhower gifted the watch to his aide Sergeant John Moaney. and after he passed away nine years later it was purchased by collector Raleigh DeGeer Amyx

The auction house selling the timepiece said having 'the world's most powerful man wearing a Rolex on his wrist' made the company what it is today

The Rolex has been described as 'the most important and most valuable Rolex watch' ever made

After Sgt Moaney's death in 1978 the watch was bought by prominent collector Raleigh DeGeer Amyx.

It is tipped to surpass the world record for a Rolex watch set last year when a rare 1949 Rolex Oyster Perpetual sold for around Â£740,000.

Bobby Livingston, vice president of Boston auction house RR Auction, which is selling the watch, said Eisenhower 'loved' his watch and was often photographed wearing it.

He said: 'He wore it throughout his term of office and into his retirement. Having the world's most powerful man wearing a Rolex on his wrist made the company into what it is today.'

Mr Livingston added: 'We think this is the most important and most valuable Rolex watch ever made - and so do a lot of others.'
