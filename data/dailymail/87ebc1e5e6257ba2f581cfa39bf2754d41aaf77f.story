A talented footballer who was once 
tipped to play for England has revealed how mental health problems 
triggered his fall from the peak of the sport.

Michael
Johnson was snapped up by Manchester City when he was just 18 as 
experts compared him to some of the best players the club had ever 
produced.

However, 
despite making his debut in 2006 and appearances for the under-21 
England team, it has emerged the midfielder's career has been cut short as he battles mental health problems.

Mr Johnson, 24, told the Manchester Evening News he has spent time in the Priory as part of his ongoing treatment.

He said: 'I am more disappointed than anyone but that's the way it goes.

'I have been attending the Priory 
Clinic for a number of years now with regard to my mental health and 
would be grateful if I could now be left alone to live the rest of my 
life.'

Fellow footballers 
have suggested that pressure and the huge sums of money paid to the 
young footballer may have contributed to his decline.

The midfielder is now without a club after it emerged this week that Mr 
Johnson was released by Manchester City before Christmas as the club 
conceded defeat in keeping him from alcohol and gambling.

City has paid up the remaining six months of his £25,000-a-week contract.

Mr Johnson was convicted of two drink-driving offences in September after crashing his car in Manchester in May last year.

His fall from grace was confirmed 
after a picture of him at a take-away was posted on Twitter on Monday showing him looking larger and 
less fit than during his playing days.

Former
City team-mate Joey Barton, who has also courted controversy during his career, wrote on Twitter: 'Just read about young Michael Johnson at Man 
City. So sad. Had the world at his feet.

'That's what too much pressure/£, can do to young lads.'

City legend Colin Bell, who Mr Johnson was once compared to, told the Manchester Evening News: 'It’s a terrible shame. It’s hard to accept when your career ends early and for his to end at his age will be really difficult to take.'

Mr Johnson was heralded as a rising star by former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson, who once said he would not swap the youngster even for the likes of Steven Gerrard.

After being signed by the Manchester club from Everton's youth team, Mr Johnson took just two years to make the senior team.

He made his debut in the 2006-07 season and featured 10 times under manager Stuart Pearce.

The following season he scored two brilliant goals but his career took a downward slide after being out of the game for four months while he had a double-hernia operation.

After signing a five-year contract following his recovery, the then City manager Mark Hughes described him as an 'outstanding young player with a great talent and a great future ahead of him and we want that future to be at City, so we are working to that end. The guy has everything in front of him.'

However, following a recurrence of his abdominal injury, Mr Johnson appeared just twice for the club in 2009-10 and not at all the following season.

He failed to reignite his career during a loan spell at Leicester City.
