This World Cup has been dominated from supporters from the home continent - and with Brazil out, Argentina fans have made Rio de Janeiro's famous Copacabana beach their own.

Fans have been gathering and causing a racket ahead of their semi final against Holland which will decide who faces Germany in the Maracana on Sunday.

And while the famous Copacabana has been a sea of yellow and green at most games throughout the World Cup, now it is Argentina's turn, with blue and white as far as the eye can see.
