Six passengers who travelled on the doomed Costa Concordia cruise liner are suing the ship's owner for $460 million - days after the company offered each passenger just $14,400.

The payout - which extends to all surviving passengers, including children - is to cover the cost of the cruise, loss of luggage, expenses incurred staying in Italy after the disaster and travel home.

But lawyers are urging passengers not to take the bait, claiming they could be entitled to much more.

Now six passengers, who filed a suit 
against Costa Cruises in Miami, Florida, are demanding more cash, 
alleging that the ship operator was guilty of negligence in the run up 
to the January 13 disaster.

'Terror of death': Passengers from Miami have sued the cruise liner company $460 million for their distress

The lawyer acting for the passengers, Marc Bern, said the legal action was launched on Friday in a court in Miami, where the headquarters of parent company Carnival Cruise Lines is based.

The complaint said the survivors were 'in terror of catastrophic injury, death, drowning, having been placed in a situation where common sense said the vessel was sinking but the orders from the crew were to return to their cabins', Radar Online reported.

Bern added: 'There is not one uninjured person on that ship, whether or not they have a physical scratch. The anxiety, the stress for many of these people will never leave them.'

It comes a day after a Peruvian crew member filed a suit in Chicago for $100 million compensation.

By comparison, the offered payouts will cost the company just $50 million, although injured passengers will be dealt with on top of this.

Those who accept the offer must agree to
 drop all future legal actions against Costa Cruises, according to the 
agreement, and will be paid within a week.

Pay off: Owners of the Costa Concordia offered passengers, 
including children, $14,400 each in compensation

The company expressed their 'profound 
condolences' as they announced the package, which they said was 'higher 
than any current indemnification limits'.

Herbert Greszuk was at the bar on the fifth deck of the Costa Concordia when the luxury liner hit a reef.

Unable
 to get back to his second-deck cabin after the emergency signal came, 
he made it to a lifeboat with only the clothes on his back - leaving 
behind everything he had with him for the cruise, including his tuxedo, 
camera, jewelry, credit cards, identity papers and even his dentures.

The
 62-year-old, who runs a small flower shop and cafe in the western 
German town of Recklinghausen, counts himself lucky to have escaped the 
ship after it capsized.

But he estimates that he lost at least $8,300 in goods alone.

He
 said: 'It's about accountability. Something like this must not be 
allowed to happen again. So many people died; it's simply inexcusable.'

He added: 'I feel so lost and alone. Nobody is helping us out.

'I called the travel agency and they 
said it's not our problem any more, call Costa. I called Costa and they 
said they'd get back to me, but as of today, I haven't heard a word.'

But Italian environmental group Codacons
 has urged survivors to join a class-action lawsuit it is coordinating 
with U.S. and Italian law firms, claiming each passenger could be 
awarded $165,000.

'All those who were on board the ship are
 entitled to be compensated not only for material damage, but also to 
moral ones, such as fear and terror suffered, and the risks related to 
physical integrity,' its website reads.

'It is inadmissible, despite the 
sophisticated equipment on board such vessels, installed in order to 
avoid clashes aground, such accidents occur.'

Giulia Bongiorno, an attorney who has 
gathered around 50 survivors for a lawsuit, told the Daily Beast: 
'Throwing money at survivors to effectively get them out of sight is not
 what we have in mind.

'These people have no idea what their
 agonising experience is worth yet. It could take years to understand 
the full impact of the experience.'

Lawsuits are expected to be filed in 
Germany, Italy, the United States and elsewhere.

Attorney
 Hans Reinhardt, who represents a
 dozen German survivors, said passengers did sign liability wavers
 - a common requirement for cruises - but that he considers them void 
under the circumstances.

He
 said: 'You do not sign off on a disaster situation, what you sign there
 is for normal daily situations like if there is a little storm or high 
water or something like that.

'This was such a large failure by the captain and by Costa that you can
 sign whatever you want but you will still get your money.'

Disaster: Passengers were 
taken to safety by lifeboats launched into the night seas. The ship's 
owners say they will receive the compensation for their losses and
 experiences as a result of the incident

The uproar comes as recovery operations 
on the sunken ship yielded a body of a woman who was not wearing a life 
jacket, bringing the total number of deaths to 17. Fifteen are still 
missing.

Rough seas off Italy's Tuscan coast 
forced a delay in the planned start of the operation to remove the fuel 
and officials said pumping may now not begin until midweek.

The Concordia ran aground 
on January 13 off the port of the island of Giglio port after the 
captain deviated from his planned route and gashed the hull of the ship 
on a reef.

Some 4,200 
passengers and crew endured a panicked evacuation after the abandon ship
 alarm didn't sound until the ship had capsized so much that some life 
boats couldn't be lowered.

The Concordia's captain, Francesco 
Schettino, remains under house arrest, accused of manslaughter, causing a
 shipwreck and abandoning a ship before its passengers had evacuated.

He has admitted he took the ship on 'tourist navigation' to bring it 
close to Giglio but said the reef he hit wasn't marked on his nautical 
charts.
