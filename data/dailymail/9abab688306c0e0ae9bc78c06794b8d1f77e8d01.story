Restaurants have been ordered by the Government to serve smaller portions in the name of healthy eating – while charging customers the same amount to make themselves a healthy profit.

The aim is to cut calories in curries and pizzas and reduce customers’ waistlines. But critics say customers will be left with lighter wallets too.

Advice on the Department for Health website suggests cutting the size of pizzas and curries in order to cut calories and boost restaurant profits by keeping the same price

The Department of Health advice, which it posted on its website, states:

Italian restaurants should  cut an inch off the width of a pizza, saying: ‘You will save money by using less dough and toppings.’ It adds: ‘Thinner bases – bigger profits!’

Indian takeaways should scrap free poppadums and use smaller containers as ‘smaller portion sizes will still be satisfying and will save you money!’

Chinese restaurants can reduce the amount of salt in their food. ‘Customers won’t notice if you do this gradually.’

Fish and chip shops should use thick chips that absorb less fat which ‘can save calories and cut costs’.

Sandwich shops can reduce the size of fillings. ‘Use grated cheese instead of sliced’ and if customers ask for a spread, ‘spread it thinly’.

Chefs are also told to use single instead of double cream and fresh chilli instead of chilli oil.

There is even a ‘money bag’ symbol on the department’s site highlighting health-promoting tips which will also boost the profits of food outlets.

But critics question whether the Government should be encouraging restaurants to offer customers less value for money, even if its motivation is to improve the nation’s health.  

Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, a GP who is on the health select committee, said the tips to reduce portions were ‘sensible advice’ as the obesity epidemic is now so serious.

But she added: ‘I can understand, however, why some object to the phrasing of the advice and that this should be done specifically to boost profits without customers’ knowledge.’

The money bag symbol appears five times in the two-page document for chip shops, along with the advice: ‘Use thick, straight-cut chips. These absorb less fat, so you use less oil and it’s healthier for your customers. Make your chips using a cutter with at least a 14mm (just over half an inch) cross section.’

There is also a money bag symbol by the suggestions for sandwich shops to use grated cheese. It states: ‘This can mean you use less cheese and it will add volume to your sandwiches.’

They are also told to put salad in every sandwich as a ‘good way’ of ‘using less of the expensive filling like meat and fish’.

Italian restaurants are told: ‘Healthier eating is becoming more and more important to customers. Follow these tips to ensure you stay ahead of the market and increase profits!’

The advice continues: ‘Cheese and meat can be expensive as well as high in fat and salt, so be sparing when adding these ingredients and be generous with vegetable toppings.

‘Customers won’t notice if you add a tiny bit less and you will save money!’

Indian outlets are exhorted: ‘Don’t serve poppadums free of charge as these can add a lot  of fat and calories to a meal.’

But Ranjit Mathrani, chairman of Britain’s largest group of Indian restaurants including Chutney Mary in Chelsea, West London, said while he supported cutting obesity, the guidelines were ‘reprehensible’.

He said: ‘The idea of cutting portion sizes and charging the same is unethical. It is unethical and disreputable and likely to backfire because it is encouraging restaurants to pull a fast one over customers.’

The Responsibility Deal initiative, chaired by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, which is designed to pressure the food industry into producing healthier products, has already led to chocolate bars shrinking in size while staying the same price.

Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies last week admitted the average man and woman is now overweight.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Research shows that overall we are eating more than we should, so controlling portion sizes and reformulating to use less fat, salt and sugar is an essential part of the Responsibility Deal.

‘Many small businesses don’t have the technical knowledge to make the right changes – these tips are designed to help them serve healthier food.’
