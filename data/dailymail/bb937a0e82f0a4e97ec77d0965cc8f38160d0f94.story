A drunken reveller who was refused a McDonald's after walking to a drive-through has been banned from the road after getting caught driving back in her car.

Wendy Simpson was nearly three times over the alcohol limit when police stopped her going back for a late night burger in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

The 25-year-old had initially gone to the fast food outlet on foot following a night out drinking, but she was told she wouldn't be served unless she used the 24-hour drive-through.

'Foolish decision': The McDonald's drive-through in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, where Wendy Simpson was initially turned away from because she was on foot

Simpson, of Northgate, Almondbury, West Yorkshire, admitted making the 'foolish decision' to return to McDonald's in her car.

Kirklees Magistrates' Court heard how police stopped Simpson's Vauxhall Corsa on March 8, after they spotted her driving erratically just after 3.30am.

They signaled for her to stop after she swerved and hit the kerb.

After initially stopping, Simpson drove off again before stopping at a red light.

Alex Bozman, prosecuting, said: 'When police spoke with her they detected alcohol on her breath and she was acting in a manner that suggested alcohol had been consumed.”

Breath tests revealed that she had 100 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - just under three times the legal limit of 35 microgrammes.

Arfaq Nabi, defending, said that earlier that evening Simpson had gone to a works party, and had taken a taxi there and back to the home of her boyfriend's parents.

While she was waiting for him to return she decided to go out and get something to eat, Mr Nabi explained.

He said: 'She walked to McDonald's but staff refused to serve her. This was because the counter was closed and she couldn't use the 24-hour drive-through unless she was in a vehicle.

'Foolishly she goes home, gets into her vehicle and drives to McDonald's.

'On her way back she was stopped by police.'

Magistrates heard that Simpson, a service manager for a large company, had not been in court before the incident.

She was banned from driving for 24 months, and was also sentenced to a one-year community order.

This includes a 15-day activity requirement, which will address her alcohol consumption, and 40 hours of unpaid work.
