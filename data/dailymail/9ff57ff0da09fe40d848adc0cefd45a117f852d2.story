Hurricane-force winds battered the Svendborg Maersk as it sailed around the Atlantic coast of Europe.

The Danish ship Svendborg began losing containers off northern France after it was hit with 30ft waves and 60 knots winds on February 14.

But it only discovered the extent of its loss after it arrived in the Spanish port of Malaga this week.

The company said of the 520 that have gone unaccounted for, 85 per cent of them were empty and the others held dry goods like frozen meat.

It stressed that none of the missing storage boxes contained dangerous goods.

Many of the containers that survived the storm collapsed and were left crushed.

Palle Laursen, vice president of operations for Maersk Line, said: 'The total number of lost containers turned out to be even worse than we feared.

'Svendborg Maersk experienced unexpected, extreme weather conditions â€“ and we will now carefully examine our procedures to see if they need correction in order to avoid similar incidents in the future,' Sea Trade Global reported.

On Friday the French environmental group Robin des Bois said it would sue Maersk for failing to disclose the full extent of the loss when it occurred, putting the lives of others in danger, causing pollution and abandoning waste at sea.

The group claims the containers were a lasting danger to fishing vessels and the environment.

The revelations about the overboard containers came after a shipping container stuffed with a million cigarettes washed up on the Devon coast.

The 40-foot box - which contains 14 tonnes of cigarettes - which landed at Seaton, Devon, could be the first of many to wash up on the Lyme Bay coast in the coming days.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is arranging recovery of the Maersk container which landed over the weekend.

Police officers who have cordoned off the beach issued a stern warning to anyone hoping to pick up any free loot.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'It was reported by a member of the public... and officers are on scene to make sure no one puts themselves at risk to recover anything.

The battered container which spilled its contents over a wide area has now been cordoned off by police

'The contents belong initially to the 
original owner of the container, and then to the official Receiver of 
Wrecks, so anyone taking anything that washes ashore, even one packet of
 cigarettes, is effectively committing theft and will be prosecuted.

'So the message to anyone intending to go down there looking for free fags is don't bother.'

Meanwhile, a second container containing millions more cigarettes was recovered from the English Channel by coastguards.

The 40ft long Maersk crate was spotted floating in the sea seven miles south of Portland Bill, Dorset.

Coastguards tasked a local tug boat to the area and the crew managed to attach a line to it and pull it into Portland Port.

It is expected that more containers will wash up in coming days.
