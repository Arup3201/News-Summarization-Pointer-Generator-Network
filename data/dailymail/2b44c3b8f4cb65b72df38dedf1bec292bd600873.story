Trevor McKendrick, an atheist from Utah, earns more than $100,000 annually in revenue from his Spanish Bible apps

A Utah man has made a six-figure salary by selling Bible apps, but feels guilty because he is not a practicing Christian.

Trevor McKendrick, an entrepreneur from Salt Lake City who was raised Mormon but is now an atheist, has successfully created two Spanish Bible apps.

After launching the apps and raking in an annual revenue of $100,134, he has begun questioning his morality over selling the religious book he does not believe in.

McKendrick attended a Mormon college and was also married in a Mormon temple, but he eventually left the church, according to Business Insider.

He said that he does not believe in Christianity or the Bible, and likened him selling the apps to someone selling Harry Potter and telling people it was real.

'What if you sold Harry Potter books or Lord of the Rings books, but you told people it was real?,' he said in a podcast interview with StartUp. 'And you told people if they would just learn how to write spells themselves, they could heal their children? 

'And if you sold that as a real thing? I would feel terrible about that. 

'But that's really the situation I am in selling the Bible. I am selling this thing I truly believe is fiction.'

Both of his apps are Spanish translations of the Bible for iPhones.

One app is a text version that is free to download and offers in-app purchases, and took less than $500 to create, according to the International Business Times. The second one is an audio book app that sells for $9.99 in the Apple app store.

The more successful of the two, the audio book app, made $5,000 to $6,000 per month following its launch, and his annual revenue jumped from $74,034 in the first year to $100,134 in the second year.

McKendrick came up with the idea in 2012 as a way to pay his $600 rent and realized that there were a few Spanish Bible apps that were terrible.

Since creating the apps, he said he has received emails from customers asking for prayer as they think he is a preacher.

McKendrick said: 'If you're emailing the maker of an app to get help for your son, you're probably not a in a great spot. Trading that for profit weighs on me a little bit.' 

But when asked if he felt guilty enough to stop selling the product, McKendrick said even though he might have a problem with it, he cannot stop. 

He told the Huffington Post that he takes pride in his positively reviewed product that people really like and are grateful for, which makes it easier for him to reconcile his faith with his business.
