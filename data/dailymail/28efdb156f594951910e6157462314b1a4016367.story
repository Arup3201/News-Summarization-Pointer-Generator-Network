For better or worse, cats are so nimble there are few places they can't find their way into. Then why, given such a choice, would one choose the gap between two window panes? 

One cat with an answer for that is Googoo, this furry friend from South Korea who did exactly that.

Googoo didn't seem too worried about being in the predicament though while being filmed by her  owner.

The cute kitty from Gwangmyeong appeared relaxed as she waited for her owner to turn off the camera and help her out. 

The rescue wasn't a frantic one, with the owner telling Newsflare that Googoo managed to fall asleep in the gap while snadwiched in the window.  

The owner added that Googoo is now safe and well.
