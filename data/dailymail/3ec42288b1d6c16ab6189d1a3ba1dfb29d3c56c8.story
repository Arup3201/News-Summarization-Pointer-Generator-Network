Eden Hazard might have just committed his long-term future to Chelsea - but that isn't stopping their Champions League opponents Paris Saint-Germain from sniffing around the Belgian playmaker

Chelsea travel to Paris to face PSG in their Champions League round of 16 first leg on Tuesday, and the hosts' captain Thiago Silva has spoken out about his admiration for the 24-year-old Blues star.

Hazard put pen to paper on a new five-and-half-year, £200,000-a-week contract at Stamford Bridge on Thursday and Silva made it clear his side would be wary of the man who scored Chelsea's only goal in their 3-1 defeat at the Parc des Princes last season.

'He is not just good, he is very good!' Silva said. 'If he really comes, he will be very welcome.'

'All their players are very accomplished, but I believe the Brazilians always make the difference, plus Hazard.'

Silva, who also picked Hazard as one of his players of the tournament so far, claimed there would be a change in attitude from the French champions compared to last season's meeting between these two sides.

Following a 3-1 win in Paris that saw the PSG bench goading Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, Silva and co crashed out of Europe's premier competition at Stamford Bridge with Demba Ba's late goal securing a 2-0 win allowing Chelsea to advance on the away goals rule.

'In the last match (against Chelsea) we thought our team was already qualified,' the Brazilian told Champions League sponsors Nissan. 'We learn a lot from all defeats. One important thing to always remember is that until the referee stops, the match is not done yet.'
