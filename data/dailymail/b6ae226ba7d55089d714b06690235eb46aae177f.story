Wildfires have forced thousands of people to flee their homes on the Spanish Canary Islands of La Gomera and Tenerife.

Firefighters were battling searing temperatures and stiff winds as the flames threatened a World Heritage site whose wooded land is 11 million years old.

On La Gomera, the fires have destroyed 7,400 acres forcing the evacuation of more than 4,000 people from 13 villages in the island's west and southwest. On Tenerife 2,200 were moved from their homes.

Fighting the flames: Emergency services scrambled a massive operation to hold back the fires as they approached houses of the El Tanque village on the Tenerife island, Canary Islands

Scorched earth: A firefighter works to stop the spread of wildfires which are sweeping through parts of La Gomera, Spain, today

Concerning: Smoke billows from a wildfire over the residential town of Chipude, near of the National Park of Garajonay

About a tenth of the reserve has been ravaged as the heatwave which began in North Africa showed no sign of cooling down

Casimimo
Curbelo, local government leader of La Gomera, said: 'We are living 
through hell, we have asked the central government for more resources 
with which to fight the fire.'

Water-carrier aircraft flew 
missions as fresh blazes raged in the La Gomera's Garajonay nature reserve, home to rare 
subtropical forests which have around 450 plant species.

About a tenth of the reserve has been ravaged as the heatwave which began in North Africa showed no sign of cooling down.

Garajonay - a very rare example of the 
type of humid subtropical forest that covered almost all of Europe 
before the arrival of humans - was declared a
World Heritage site in 1986.

Regional agriculture spokeswoman Nancy 
Melo said it contains forests 'of incalculable 
ecological value'.

Devastation: Wildfire swept through parts La Gomera, the Canary Islands, leaving swathes of destruction in its path

An emergency services official confirmed 
fires were still burning on three fronts on Tenerife, 'There is no positive change for
the moment,' said a spokesman.

Officials fear the heatwave
which pushed temperature to 40C (104F) and followed Spain's driest 
winter in 70 years has created the perfect conditions for devastating 
wildfires.

Firefighters
battling the blazes on the islands off Morocco were up against 'high 
temperatures, low humidity and wind' that fanned the flames, regional 
economy minister Javier Gonzalez Ortiz said.

Hundreds
of firefighters are also battling a blaze near Greece's Mount Athos, a 
World Heritage site housing an ancient monastic community.

Scorched: Burnt fields caused by wildfires are seen in El Tanque

Treatment: A woman that was evacuated from an area affected by wildfires lies on stretcher next to an ambulance before being taken to hospital

Ventura del Carmen Rodriguez, the 
island's environment secretary, said last week it would take between 30 
and 40 years for Garajonay's burned areas to recover.

Between
January 1 and July 29, wildfires destroyed 130,830 hectares of 
vegetation in Spain, according to the agriculture ministry.

At
the heart of his island lies Garajonay National Park, which experts say
contains woodlands that have survived since the Tertiary age, 11 
million years ago.

Regional governments have reported that 10 wildfires are raging across Spain today.

Firefighters have been working around the clock to try and extinguish the flames

Choking fumes: Smoke billows across houses as a wildfire burns near Chipude Village, La Gomera, Spain, as wildfires spurred by high temperatures raged across Spain's Canary Islands of La Gomera and Tenerife as well as Ourense in northwestern Spain

Officials said Saturday that a wildfire thought to be under control on a Spanish island is now spreading, threatening a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Regional agriculture spokeswoman Nancy Melo said flames on the Canary Island of La Gomera were encroaching on Garajonay National Park, which contains forests 'of incalculable ecological value'.

Melo said the fire had begun a week ago, and had almost been extinguished, with 'aircraft used to fight the blaze being sent to other islands'.

Garajonay - a very rare example of the type of humid subtropical forest that covered almost all of Europe before the arrival of humans - was declared a national park in 1981 and a World Heritage Site in 1986.

Melo said some of the wooded land had been in existence for 11 million years, and belonged to a bygone geological period called the Tertiary age, which began 65 million years ago.
