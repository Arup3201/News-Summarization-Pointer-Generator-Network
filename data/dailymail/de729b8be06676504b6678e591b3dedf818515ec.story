This is the moment a sham marriage suspect was arrested only seconds before he was due to walk down the aisle with an Eastern European woman.

The 27-year-old Pakistani man was about to wed a 25-year-old Czech
woman at a registry office located in King George’s Hall, Blackburn, Lancashire, the Home Office has said.

It added that two immigration 
enforcement officers, acting on information the relationship may not be genuine, arrived at the venue 10.30am on Thursday - just as the ceremony was about to take place.

The man was arrested and checks revealed he was in the country illegally having over-stayed his student visa.

The woman he had been due to marry was interviewed by officers and later released.

The Home Office also said that two days earlier another suspected sham marriage was prevented in a second raid.

Officers arrested a 26-year-old-man who was in the country illegally having also overstayed his student visa. He was due to marry a 18-year-old Latvian woman.

Both grooms will now be deported back to Pakistan.

After the arrests Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'We are determined to stop migrants abusing the marriage system to cheat immigration rules.

'Measures outlined in the Immigration 
Bill include extending the marriage and civil penalty notice period to 
28 days in England and Wales, and 70 days in some circumstances.

'This will give our officers and 
registrars more time to investigate, prosecute and remove those 
attempting to stage sham marriages'

A
sham marriage or civil partnership typically occurs when a non-European
national marries someone from the European Economic Area as a means of 
attempting to gain long-term residency and the right to work and claim 
benefits in the UK.

A 
crackdown on the problem has been launched after a number of high 
profile cases, including large scale sham marriage rings operating in 
Accrington and Blackburn, were revealed by police.
