A hilarious new video showing what life would be like if we employed Tinder's tactics in the real world has gone viral.

The short film, made by Danish filmmaker Rolf Glumsoe Nielson, conveys a world where a simple swipe can knock people out of sight based on their appearance - just like the app.

Tinder, which helps users browse all the single people in one area, has become one of the most downloaded apps of the year.

Real life Tinder: A new short film shows a woman employing the dating app's tactics in real life

Swiping to the left means not interested, swiping to 
the right is a yes. If two people swipe to the right on
each other's profiles, they are automatically connected to a private chatroom where further information can be exchanged.

This is portrayed in the new video, which sees a young blonde woman sauntering around a public place scouting for potential men.

But as she passes them and realises she isn't interested, she quickly swipes them left as the words 'nope' appear on the screen - just like they do on the app.

Some of the men can be seen flying across the room as the lyrics 'to the left, to the left' from Beyonce's song Irreplaceable can be heard.

Imagine if...The film shows a man checking out a woman but clearly not interested, she simply swipes him out of sight

Unlucky! Just as the woman finds a man she likes the look of and swipes right, he sends her flying left; an accurate depiction of Tinder  

The short movie concludes with the protagonist finally spotting a man she likes. As she swipes right to 'like' him, unfortunately he swipes left and she can be seen flying off the screen.

Tinder, which won best new start-up of 2013 at the Crunchie Awards, is praised for its easy-to-use design and is now matching 5 
million people per day, with users swiping through 750 million 
profiles every single day, its founder has revealed.

Founder and CEO Sean Rad claims the apps success is down to it being 'like the real world but better'.

He also told users that the profile picture was key - and that 'headshots don't work' on the site.

Speaking at Upfront Summit in Los 
Angeles, Rad said Tinder started about a year and half ago because 
friends realized they were having trouble meeting people.

He told the conference 'In the real world we send out signals subconsciously to people if we're interested or not,' 

Success: Dating app Tinder is now matching 5 million 
people per day, and users are swiping through 750 million profiles a 
day, its founder has revealed.

Popular: On average users open the app seven times a day - with almost a billion matches since it launched 18 months ago

'We wanted to build something that makes that the norm,' he said, according to MarketingLand

Part of the apps recent success has 
been down to the 'Sochi effect' when athletes in the winter Olympics 
told of the apps popularity in the athlete's village.

Rad
 told the Wall Street Journal that Tinder saw a 400 percent day-over-day
 spike in growth during the Sochi Games. Many of the athletes used the 
app as a way to hook up at the Russian resort town.
