Before her granddaughter Maggie was born, Karen Bowersox knew little about Down syndrome and even less about fashion design.

But as she watched Maggie grow, the Ohio grandmother was inspired to create a range of clothing that fitted the shape and needs of those who had the condition.

After finding a designer to help with her idea, Ms Bowersox launched Downs Designs, a stylish range of clothing, which can be altered to meet each client's needs.

Ms Bowersox said she came up with the idea for the clothing range when Maggie was four, and her family were finding it hard to find clothes that fitted her.

'People with Down syndrome typically 
have a short thigh bone and upper arm bone which makes sleeves and pants
 too long and pants and shirts sleeves donâ€™t break properly where they 
bend,' she told Daily Dot.

'With low muscle tone, they often develop
 larger tummies and may gain weight due to thyroid problems. Clothes off
 the rack generally donâ€™t fit well at all.'

In 2010, Ms Bowersox got in touch with a young designer and the pair set about creating a fashionable range that would fit the shape of someone with Down syndrome.

One of the lines they focused on first was a range of jeans. While they are a wardrobe basic for many people, those with Down syndrome often find buttons and zips difficult.

'Having
 a stylish pair of jeans that is comfortable, fits properly and allows 
independent dressing gives the wearer a sense of self worth. All that in a pair of jeans is so inspiring to me,' Ms Bowersox said.

Her clothing line - Downs Designs - offers jeans, capri pants and shirts, but one of its biggest draws is the tailoring service that is offered.

Customers can apply for a Try On service that lets them find the perfect fit. Ms Bowersox then takes note of the adjustments and sends them a personally tailored outfit. 

'People have been so grateful that 
someone has taken on this task that that is what has kept me going 
during my most difficult times,' she said.

A quick glance through her website's testimonials page shows just how life-changing Downs Designs has been for her customers.

Tim, a young German with Down syndrome, was featured on the company's Facebook page showing off his new outfit of made-to-measure jeans and a long sleeved shirt. 

His parents had used Skype to communicate with the design company to get the best fit.

The mother of a young boy named Jasper also posted pictures of her son wearing his new jeans while playing and horse riding.

His
 mother thanked the company, writing: 'He's very comfortable and I love 
them because I don't have to struggle with buttoning up this energetic 
little boy who won't lie down for me to zip up other jeans over his 
belly.'

As well as 
accolades from happy customers across the world Ms Bowersox has also 
been awarded a $50,000 prize to use for digital marketing in the 
national Staples Push it Forward contest.
