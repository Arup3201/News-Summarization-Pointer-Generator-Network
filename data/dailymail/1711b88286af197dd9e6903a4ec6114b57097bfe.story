A 46-stone woman is said to be in a critical condition in hospital after a dangerous skin infection left her fighting for her life.

Previously named Britain’s fattest teenager, Georgia Davis, 20, was admitted to the hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, on Friday suffering with the skin infection cellulitis.

Georgia is said to be drifting in and out of consciousness on a resuscitation ward, and requires assistance to breathe.

Georgia Davis was admitted to hospital on Friday suffering from a severe skin infection

Georgia Davis, now aged 20,was previously named Britain's fattest teenager, having battled with her weight since childhood

Georgia, who currently weighs about 46st after re-gaining 4st of the 16st she lost in a 9 month hospital stay, is said to be seriously ill, and requiring help with her breathing after cellulitis spread around her body

Stepdad Arthur Treloar, 73, told The Sun: ‘We've been told it's bad — really serious.

‘She was put on the ward on Friday and now she's having to be helped to breathe. We've been told she might not make it.’

Georgia had lost nearly 16 stone during a nine month hospital stay, dropping from 56st to 40st 6lb, but has returned to her unhealthy diet since her release, piling on four stone in just five months.

She contracted cellulitis, a usually easily treated skin infection, in her leg, which left her unable to leave her armchair.

Georgia was dramatically admitted to hospital last summer after a desperate call to her mother Lesley, seen here with her daughter, when she become unable to stand

The infection, which is caused by bacteria entering the skin through a cut or abrasion, worsened and spread around her body.

Obese
people are at increased risk of cellulitis due to skin breaking and 
becoming thin at fat folds and decreased circulation which allows the 
bacteria to enter and spread.

If the infection enters the blood stream it can cause sepsis and become life threatening.

A 10ft by 10ft space was cut into to the top floor of her house so that the emergency services could remove Georgia when she was admitted to hospital last year

Extracting Georgia from her house, v, to take her to hospital last year, cost an estimated £100,000 and took 50 emergency workers eight hours

Georgia first hit the headlines aged 15, when it was revealed she was flying to the US to enrol in a fat camp in a desperate attempt to shed some of her 33st girth.

She successfully lost 15 stone at the camp, however the teen began to gain weight again when she moved back into her parent’s home when her step father was diagnosed with lung cancer.

The teenager used to order up to 20 
kebabs each week from a takeaway and gorge throughout the day on 
chocolate, crisps and two litre bottles of Coca Cola, causing her weight
to balloon to 56st.

Georgia was dramatically admitted to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales in June last year, after a terrifying call to her mother from her bedroom to tell her she couldn’t stand up.

Her size meant that the emergency services were unable to extract Georgia from her bedroom, and eventually were forced to demolish the walls of her house.

It cost an estimated £100,000 as emergency workers spent eight hours cutting her free as two walls of her home in Aberdare, South Wales, were demolished to remove her from her first-floor bedroom.

By the time the 50-man emergency team cut her free, she had not left the house for about eight months.

The then 19-year-old lost weight during her stay in the Prince Charles Hospital, going from 56st to 40st 6lb, after being placed on a strict diet.

At the time she vowed to lose weight and get her life back on track, saying: ‘I'm sick of being like this - I'm getting my life back.’
