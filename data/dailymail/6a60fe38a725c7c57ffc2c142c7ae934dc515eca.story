As you watch the drunken antics of eligible new Downton Abbey character Sir John Bullock on your screens tonight, spare a thought for Andrew Alexander, the actor who plays him.

This time last year, during his star turn in the West End production of The 39 Steps, newly married and just back from an African honeymoon, he was struck down with  a parasitic infection that doctors failed to diagnose for almost five months.

Some rare African disease perhaps? In fact, Andrew had an incredibly common bacterial infection: toxoplasmosis.

Many will have heard about it in the context of pregnant women. The bacteria, toxoplasma, that causes the disease hides in cat faeces and uncooked meat, and can attack  the developing foetus. Expectant women are advised to avoid changing cat litter and eating rare meat.

A Food Standards Agency report, published in 2012, suggests that 350,000 people become infected every year in the UK.

Only one in five of those feels ill. Should symptoms appear, they are similar to a those of a viral infection such as flu or glandular fever – swollen lymph nodes in the neck and groin, fever, aching muscles and weakness.

When Andrew, 31, became unwell he had no idea what was wrong. ‘I had been in The 39 Steps for 11 months, doing eight shows a week,’ said the actor – who last week was reported to be Kate Middleton’s first crush after they appeared together in a school production of My Fair Lady.

Andrew took a break to get married and then went away for a three-week honeymoon. When he and his artist wife Araxie, 30, returned, he began to feel tired and lethargic with a sore throat.

He thought he was just run down.But over the following week strange lumps appeared on his neck.

‘One night, just before we went on stage, my co-star, Catherine Bailey, gasped with horror, “What on earth is on your neck?” ’ His lymph glands had grown to the size of golf balls.

‘I felt like Frankenstein,’ he says. ‘The whole cast gathered around to look at me.’

His production company immediately sent him to a Harley Street doctor. ‘He thought it was viral,’ says Andrew. ‘I was given a laryngoscopy – where a camera looks at the back of the throat – and sent home to recuperate.’

But his health continued to deteriorate. He was exhausted and was signed off work for two weeks. After a fortnight, Andrew’s puzzled GP referred him to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington – but they were equally perplexed.

Professor Edward Guy, head of the National Toxoplasma Research Unit in Swansea, explained why the infection can be difficult to diagnose.

‘Toxoplasma is a single-celled microscopic parasite ingested via the mouth. Once in the body it enters the bloodstream via the gut. This  is the point at which the immune system kicks in and we feel ill.

‘Most people don’t notice they  have it, but if symptoms appear  they are similar to a viral infection and the immune system reacts  and suppresses it, usually within four weeks.’

The parasite is easy to ingest, but the way it survives is quite unsavoury. ‘Toxoplasma is only able to procreate within the gut of a cat,’ says Prof Guy. ‘The resulting eggs – called oocysts – exit the cat’s body in faeces. These can survive for a year or more, often in or around the soil where cats choose to defecate.’

Humans may ingest it by touching soil then putting fingers in their mouths. It can also be caught by eating undercooked meat from an animal that has eaten oocysts. It cannot be passed from person to person.

‘Because of the lack of symptoms, doctors rarely come across toxoplasmosis,’ says Dr Carmel Curtis, consultant microbiologist at The London Clinic. ‘Most people don’t even go to their doctor.’

After three months Andrew was referred to a West London health centre with a tropical disease unit. He was screened for various infections, and one of the blood tests showed toxoplasmosis. ‘It was a huge relief to have a diagnosis,’ he says. ‘After months of uncertainty,  I was told that I’d recover all by myself and just to go home.’

It is not known why some people have the kind of extreme symptoms Andrew experienced. ‘It could be because he ingested more of the oocysts,’ suggests Prof Guy.

Although he is now fine, the toxoplasma will remain in his body for the rest of his life and could be reactivated should his immune system be compromised.

Some think the existence of the parasite in the central nervous system may cause subtle behavioural and personality changes. A study published last month even suggested that infected mice lose their fear of cats – meaning that cats consume the mice and the parasite is able to continue its cycle.

Andrew now glows with health, however – all 6ft 3in of him – and has put his nightmare behind him. ‘At least I was better by the time we started filming Downton,’ he says.
