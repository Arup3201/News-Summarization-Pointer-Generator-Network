Rebekah Brooks allegedly planned to cover up her involvement in phone hacking with an operation inspired by war film 'Where Eagles Dare'

Rebekah Brooks tried to cover up her involvement in phone hacking using an operation inspired by the war film Where Eagles Dare, her trial heard yesterday.

The former News International chief executive is said to have embarked on a campaign of self-preservation in the dying days of the News of the World.

The 45-year-old is accused of hiding incriminating evidence from police and attempting to pin blame on her colleagues before the tabloid was shut down.

The Old Bailey was told she enlisted the help of her racehorse trainer husband Charlie Brooks, a team of security staff and her chauffeur.

On the day of her arrest, her 50-year-old husband and News International head of security Mark Hanna allegedly coordinated an elaborate operation, codenamed Blackhawk, removing computer evidence from her Oxfordshire and London homes – hours before police searched them.

While Brooks was being interviewed by detectives, her husband was seen on CCTV stashing a bag and a laptop behind some bins in the car park below their Chelsea Harbour flat.

Hanna, 50, and two other security guards then allegedly retrieved the haul and took it along with other bags of evidence to the newspaper offices in Wapping on July 17, 2011.

After the police searches were over, 
her lieutenants returned to dump a bag containing computers behind some 
bins in the underground car park of Brooks’s flat, using a pizza 
delivery as cover, jurors were told.

The prosecution claim the ‘only rational explanation’ for the plot was to hide material so the police could not get hold of it.

The
court heard how the two security guards, who cannot be named for legal 
reasons, likened their mission to Where Eagles Dare, in which Richard 
Burton and Clint Eastwood played Allied agents trying to rescue an 
American general from the Nazis.

Echoing
the line of Burton’s character, who used the call sign Broadsword, one 
guard texted his colleague after successfully hiding the haul: 
‘Broadsword to Danny Boy. Pizza delivered and the chicken is in the 
pot.’

Andrew Edis QC, 
prosecuting, said: ‘Broadsword is a reference to the Richard Burton 
character in Where Eagles Dare, when calling in to his controller.

‘The chicken’s in the pot just means he has delivered what he was supposed to.’

Making
reference to spying techniques, his colleague replied: ‘Ha! F***ing 
amateurs! We should have done a DLB (dead letter box) or brush contact 
on the riverside!’

Mr Edis 
told the jury the security staff agreed to log the hours for the car 
park drop-off as ‘pizza delivery’, because ‘you cannot log the hours as 
perverting the course of justice’.

But
the pair’s celebration at thwarting police was shortlived when a 
cleaner at the apartments found the bundle behind the bins the next day 
and alerted police.

Two 
hours later, Charlie Brooks and his security entourage arrived to 
collect the bin bag, only to find it had gone, Mr Edis said.

Yesterday
jurors were shown CCTV images of their panicked searches of the car 
park, while Rebekah Brooks stood watching over them.

Mr Edis said: ‘This whole exercise was quite complicated, and quite risky, and likely to go wrong, as it did.

‘If it was detected, it would be fairly disastrous, you would only contemplate doing it for a very real purpose.

‘The only rational explanation was to hide material so police can’t get it.

‘They must have been trying to hide something, otherwise they would have been behaving completely irrationally.’

Two iPads and an iPhone belonging to Brooks have not been found.

She
is also accused of conspiring with her personal assistant Cheryl Carter
to destroy seven boxes of notebooks charting her time at the News of 
the World.

On July 8, 2011 –
a day after it was announced the tabloid would close –Carter, 49, is 
said to have removed Brooks’s notebooks dating from 1995 to 2007 from 
the News International archive and taken them home.

The notebooks have also never been found.

Brooks
is also alleged to have instigated a plot to make scapegoats of her 
predecessor as News International chief executive Les Hinton and the 
then editor Colin Myler.

In 
an email entitled ‘Plan B’ to company chairman James Murdoch, she laid 
out her plans to keep her job, suggesting Mr Murdoch leak an email to 
staff publicly denouncing phone hacking while she remained at the helm 
to oversee the launch of the Sun on Sunday.

‘A thought ... and a Les 
situation could play well into this even if it was at a later date i.e. 
the result of report when published would slam Les, Colin etc and it 
will vindicate my position.’

She
went on: ‘I am ring fenced clearly and properly. It will be written as a
slippery slope for me but I hardly have a reputation left.’

Despite her manoeuvres, she was forced to resign a few days later.

Jurors
heard that from 2009 the atmosphere at News International became 
‘fevered’ as the firm came under investigation by Parliamentary inquiry,
which was followed by a police investigation in 2011.

Brooks had ordered a ‘clean sweep’ of the company’s email database before January 2010, it was alleged.

She
denies two allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice –
one with her former personal assistant Carter – and a second with her 
husband and with former head of security Hanna. They also deny the 
charges.

Brooks and her 
successor Andy Coulson, former head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, and the 
tabloid’s ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, deny conspiring with 
others to hack phones.

Brooks also denies two counts of conspiring with 
others to commit misconduct in public office – linked to alleged 
inappropriate payments to public officials.

Coulson
is also facing two allegations that he conspired with former royal 
editor Clive Goodman, 56, to commit misconduct in public office.

All deny the charges. The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
