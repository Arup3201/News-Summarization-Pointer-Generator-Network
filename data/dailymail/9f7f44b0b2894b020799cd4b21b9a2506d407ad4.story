A Harvard student has written a damning open letter attacking the University’s indifference to an alleged sexual assault from another student.

The girl, who is anonymous, posted the letter on The Harvard Crimson's website after becoming frustrated at what she perceives as the Ivy League university's lack of support, alleging she was discouraged from pursuing charges, which meant she had to continue living in the same dorm as her attacker.

The student writes in the letter titled 'Dear Harvard: You win' that the alleged incident happened in a friend's dorm room on a Friday night 'after too many drinks'.

A Harvard student has written a damning open letter attacking the University's indifference to an alleged sexual assault from another student

She said the attacker took her shirt off and started biting her skin.

'I pushed back on his chest and asked him to stop kissing me aggressively. He laughed. He said that I should 'just wear a scarf' to cover the marks. He continued to abuse my body.'

'I was intoxicated, I was in pain, I was trapped between him and the wall, and I was scared to death that he would continue to ignore what I said. I stopped everything and turned my back to him, praying he would leave me alone.'

She writes how he started getting impatient and made an explicit demand to which she wrote: 'It did not sound like a question. I obeyed.'

The student then writes that she was discouraged from seeking charges against her alleged attacker because her assault did not fit the narrow language of Harvard’s student handbook which was written in 1993.

'When I told my House Master that I was considering an Ad Board process, I was told it was a bad time of the semester, that there would be consequences for my assailant anyway, and that we shouldn’t go through the process if it was going to be fruitless.

'Shortly after, my resident dean told me that my assailant couldn’t be punished because he didn’t know what he was doing. The resident dean compared living in the same House as my assailant to a divorced couple working in the same factory.'

She explains that although she was offered the chance to move to another House early on she declined because 'transferring felt utterly disempowering. Moving to a different House would have felt like giving up and granting even more power to my assailant.'

She also explains she wanted to be near her friends and tutors and details how she is now on anti-depressants and is now falling behind on her school work because she finds it difficult seeing her alleged attacker up to five times a day .

'I spend most of my time outside of class curled up in bed, crying, sleeping, or staring at the ceiling, occasionally wondering if I just heard my assailant’s voice in the staircase.'

The student says since the incident she 
has spent 'most of 2013 fighting the Harvard administration so that they
 would move my assailant to a different House, and I have failed 
miserably.'

But after her ordeal she writes: 'I will be moving out of my House next semester, if only—quite literally-to save my life.'

According to the Centers for Disease Control, 19 percent of undergraduate women experience attempted or completed sexual assault since starting college.

According to AAUW 42 per cent of college women who are raped tell no one about the assault. 

They state that 'While there are many reasons why people do not report, the most often cited reason in a 2009 investigation by the Center for Public Integrity was institutional barriers on campus. Two examples of these institutional barriers are administrators who respond to students with disbelief or other inappropriate behavior, and campus judiciary processes that are difficult to understand and follow. Many students who were discouraged because of these barriers transferred or withdrew from their schools, while their alleged attackers were almost uniformly unpunished.'
