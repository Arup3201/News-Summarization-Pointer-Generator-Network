French authorities are investigating whether the safety release on Michael Schumacher's ski bindings failed causing the horrific crash that has left the Formula 1 star fighting for his life.

Schumacher, 45, has shown 'slight improvement' according to medics treating him in hospital in Grenoble, France, but remains in a critical but stable condition.

The seven times world champion driver has been in an induced coma since suffering critical injuries after hitting his head on a rock while skiing with his son in the Alps last Sunday week.

Mechanical failure? Investigators are probing the theory that the bindings attaching Micaheal Schumacher's boots to his skis may have failed causing him to crash and hit his head on a rock

Investigators are now probing the theory that the safety release mechanism on Schumacher's bindings, which attach the skis to the boots, may have failed.

The bindings are designed with a mechanism that automatically releases the boots from the skis in the event of a crash in order to prevent a skier's legs being twisted by the skis as they tumble down a slope.

Critical: If Schumacher's bindings failed it could have meant his skis were release unnecessarily causing him to crash

If the safety release failed it could have meant Schumacher's skis were released uneccesarily, causing him to lose control and hit a rock.

Prosecutors are also focusing on Schumacher's speed when he fell on a small off-piste section between two relatively gentle ski runs.

Earlier this week Schumacher’s agent Sabine Kehm  denied reports her client had been speeding after allegations were made that he was doing at least 37mph.

She
 said: 'I think after having spoken with several people who have been 
with Michael at this moment, Michael and the group have been skiing on 
slopes that were normal slopes.

'Then there is a blue slope and a red slope, and in between there was a part which was deep snow, and Michael went into that.'

They are also investigating whether the limits of the ski runs next to the accident site were correctly marked.

There have been concerns that the rock was lying close enough to the piste to require some kind of protection or signage.

Scene: The Formula 1 ace crashed, hitting his head on a rock on this small off-pise section between the 'Biche' and 'Chamois' ski runs in the French resort of Meribel

Last Friday former F1 driver Philippe 
Strieff suggested that Schumacher was out of danger, but this has been 
denied by his family and management team.

But in a statement on Saturday morning, Ms Kehm said: ‘Michael’s condition remains critical but stable.’

It
 comes as French judicial authorities prepare to release their initial 
findings into the horror accident, which took place close to the 
upmarket resort of Meribel.

Patrick Quincy, the Albertville prosecutor, said his team were trying to obtain smartphone footage shot by another skier.

A
 flight attendant from Essen was filming his girlfriend on the slopes 
when he happened to catch what he believes was Schumacher’s fall in the 
background.

Dangers: Seven time F1 champion Michael Schumacher was more concerned about possible mishaps off the track than dangers on the circuit, he told an interview in 2010

Concern: Michael Schumacher's wife, Corinna, arrives at the Grenoble hospital where her husband is being treated after sustaining a head injury during a ski accident in French Alps

Vigil: Michael Schumacher's father Rolf, left, and brother Ralf arrive at Grenoble Hospital, French Alps, on Sunday where the former seven-time Formula One champion is being treated after sustaining a head injury

The 35-year-old witness has claimed he is ready to hand the footage over to the authorities, Der Spiegel reported.

An
 official spokesman for the Grenoble hospital said last night: ‘We will 
not be providing condition details for privacy reasons.’

Yesterday
 it emerged that Schumacher made a will to distribute his £750 million 
cash, cars and property empire among his wife and two children just 
three years before the ski accident which has brought him to the brink 
of death.

Prosecution: French prosecutors may be preparing to charge the operators of the ski area in Meribel where Michael Schumacher was seriously injured, pictured, after hitting his head on a rock

Back in 2010 he 
admitted that he had made a will for the first time, telling a German 
magazine: 'Yes, I have made my testament because I am a family man. 

Michael Schumacher was travelling at 12mph when he crashed, a witness claimed

'But it is less about Formula One but because of the things that can happen in everyday life.'

On Sunday his father Rold and 
brother Ralf were among the close family visitors at his bedside in 
Grenoble's University Hospital. 

German media reported that a brain scan on Friday troubled his medical team but he had a quiet weekend.

Speculation
 is mounting that French prosecutors may be preparing charges against 
the operators of the piste where the accident happened.

A press conference will be held on 
Wednesday at 10am (GMT) in the Alpine town of Albertville, local 
prosecutor Patrick Quincy said.

Attorney
 Maurice Bodecher -  a specialist in the field of ski and criminal law 
and formerly Chief Judge of the French of Ski Federation until 2010 - 
has been retained by the piste management. 

If any charges are laid they could pave the way for a multi-million pound lawsuit from the Schumacher family.

The
 main question, according to German media, is whether the scene of the 
accident - full of rocks of the type that Schumacher collided with - was 
properly marked.

The new focus of the investigation comes as more evidence emerges to suggest speed was not a primary factor in the accident.

Schumacher was apparently skiing at just 12mph when he hit a rock under the snow.
