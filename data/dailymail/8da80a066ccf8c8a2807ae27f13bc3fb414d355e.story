Adele is set to sue a French magazine after it published fake photos it claimed came from a sex tape starring the award-winning star.

The 23-year-old immediately rubbished reports that it was her in the images, which 'Public' claimed came from footage taken on a smartphone and printed on its front page today.

It comes just days after the Someone Like You singer scooped six Grammy Awards in Los Angeles and is likely to leave her legions of loyal fans shocked.

Claims: Fake photos of Adele are in the latest edition of Public magazine

Adele's lawyers Schillings is now launching legal action against the French publication, which claims to have more than three million readers each week.

A statement sent to MailOnline said: 'We are informed that the 
French magazine Public has today published images which it claims show 
our client in a sex tape.

'Our client has not appeared in a sex
 tape as claimed in the article. Our client does not appear in the photographs.

'Such claims are untrue and grossly 
defamatory. Our client is taking legal action in relation to this 
matter.'

Winner: Adele scooped six Grammy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday

Although the fake photos may cause slight embarrassment to Adele, they are unlikely to stop her enjoying what has so far been an incredible year.

Professionally she has made a startling comeback following throat surgery.

And personally, she has just moved into a new £15,000-a-month mansion close to her new boyfriend, 37-year-old charity boss Simon Konecki.

The handsome red brick West Sussex home, which was 
sold for £1.8 million in 2004 and is now said to be worth £6 
million, was built at the end of the 19th century and has its own ballroom.

Adele also cheered up her fans earlier this week by denying rumours that she will take an extended break from the music 
industry, to reveal she will soon be making another album.
