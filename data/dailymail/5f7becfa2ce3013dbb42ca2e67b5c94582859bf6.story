Recalled horror: Rebecca Leyland has spoken of being raped at the age of five by her aunt's boyfriend, school bus driver Frederick Roskell

A mother has spoken of the horrifying childhood ordeal in which she was raped on a school bus at the age of five by her aunt's boyfriend - who threatened to kill her if she exposed him.

Rebecca Leyland, now 22, fell victim to bus driver Frederick Roskell - who targeted her on the back seats before taking her to a graveyard and threatening: 'If you tell anyone I'll bury you next to them.'

She has bravely decided to share her harrowing story in the hope that more child victims will gain the courage to report their abusers - even years down the line 

The dreadful incident left Ms Leyland with lasting mental scars and only after coming forward at the age of 18 and later seeing the 'monster' jailed was she able to move on with her life.

She says she was terrified of riding on the school bus for the rest of her time in education and would always opt to walk home to avoid the trauma of reliving the devastating childhood episode.

Ms Leyland, of Preston, Lancashire, said she finally built up the courage to report paedophile Roskell after having a child of her own - and deciding she needed to act to prevent other youngsters from being targeted by him.

Following her accusations, he was convicted of raping a child under the age of 13 and jailed for 16 years. 

Ms Leyland, who lived with her mother Sandra, now 45, at the time of the abuse, said Roskell would take the school bus at weekends and drive his girlfriend's family to parks and to the coast.

They also visited a local cemetery where they would play hide and seek.

But one weekend he let all the children off the bus except Miss Leyland. At just five years old, she had no idea what was about to happen.

Recalling the horror, she said: 'The other kids jumped off but he stopped me and held me back. His big, bulky body loomed over me and then he pinned me down.

'I didn't know what it was at the time. I was only five. But he raped me on the back seats of the school bus.

'I was confused and I didn't know what was happening. I just knew that it hurt and I didn't like it. When it was over I burst into tears.'

Afterwards, Miss Leyland asked Roskell: 'Why did you hurt me? I just wanted to play with the others.'

'But he ignored me, and dragged me off the bus and into the cemetery. He took me to two graves and pointed at them.

Pointing at his own parents' graves, Roskell told the young girl: 'That's my mum and dad and if you tell anyone what I did I'll bury you next to them.'

After this incident, Ms Leyland says the sexual abuse became regular and would happen when no one was around to protect her.

She adds: 'I knew what he was doing was wrong, but I was too afraid to tell anyone in case he killed me.'

When she was seven Roskell split up with her aunt, who asked not to be named, and Miss Leyland did not see him again.

She says: 'I was so thankful that I wouldn't have to endure anymore of his abuse. But what he had done stayed with me.

'As I got older I suffered terrible flashbacks and I refused to get on a bus ever again. I'd hide at school until the school bus left and then I'd walk home.

Found courage: Ms Leyland, pictured with her daughter Alexis and boyfriend Anthony, said she finally built up the courage to report paedophile Roskell after having a child of her own 

'I was desperate to tell someone the truth, but I was still terrified that Frederick would hunt me down and kill me.'

She suffered depression and anxiety in her early teenage years before finally opening up about the ordeal to her to boyfriend, Anthony, at the age of 15, six months into their relationship.

She said: 'He was shocked but he held me as I cried. He convinced me to tell mum. More than a decade had passed and I was worried she wouldn't believe me.'

Miss Leyland's mother told her to report Roskell to the police but she refused saying she was still 'too scared to speak up, petrified that people wouldn't believe me and would label me a liar'.

She told her mother to forget what had happened and for three years continued to live in fear of meeting her abuser again.

In 2011, Miss Leyland gave birth to her daughter Alexis.

She continued: 'As soon as I held her I felt an overwhelming rush of love. I knew I couldn't let him abuse any more innocent children.'

She went to the police station in Preston and officers took her statement.

In her harrowing account, she adds: 'Reliving every detail was awful, it brought back so many painful memories.

'But Frederick had stolen my childhood and my innocence. I wanted him locked up for what he'd done.'

In 2011 Roskell was arrested but it was not until July 2013 that the case went to court.

Frederick Roskell, then 56, of Blackburn, Lancashire, appeared at Preston Crown Court charged with six counts of sexual assault of a child under the age of 13, and rape of a child under 13 – Miss Leyland.

He denied the charges but Roskell was found guilty of all the counts which referred to both Ms Leyland and another child.

In August 2013 he was jailed for 16 years.

'In court he looked weak and pathetic as he fought to avoid my gaze,' Miss Leyland said.

'In that moment I realised, I was no longer scared of him. He was a monster, who'd taken advantage of an innocent young girl.

'I'm now working to put the past behind me, and I'm focusing on my future. My rapist may have stolen my childhood, but he can't take away my future.'

Detective Sergeant Jamie Lillystone, from Lancashire Constabulary, said: 'Although these offences were committed a long time ago, the victims have had to live with the effects ever since.

'This was a particularly complex case because of the historic nature of the offences, the fact that there were multiple victims, and the fact that they were so young at the time.

'That led to difficulties in obtaining detailed, and accurate, accounts from the victims. But the result is a testament to the courage, and strength, of the two victims, and many witnesses.

'It has undoubtedly removed a very dangerous man from the streets of Lancashire.'
