A few Sundays ago during a game against the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants rookie wide receiver Odell Beckham Jnr made the catch seen round the world, breaking the Internet in a way that has only recently been eclipsed by the sight of Kim Kardashian's bare bottom.

OBJ has backed up that outstanding play with two great games in a row for the G-Men and is on pace to go over 1,000 yards and catch more than 75 passes despite missing all of September because of an injury. He’s had at least six catches and 90 receiving yards in six straight games and has scored six touchdowns thus far.

The Giants are trying to get the ball in the 22-year-old’s hands as much as possible and have handed off to him in three straight games and even had Beckham Jnr uncork a deep bomb to fellow wide receiver Rueben Randle during a trick play against the Titans on Sunday.

In a twist that shouldn’t be that surprising, it turns out the talented rookie isn’t just skilled at the American brand of football. OBJ might not exactly be David Beckham, but he may have a career in the MLS to fall back on if things in the NFL don’t work out.

A senior college football columnist wrote this about Beckham Jnr in January.before the NFL draft:

'Beckham is a fantastic athlete. You're talking about a guy who is really explosive; could've been an elite soccer player, can throw the ball very well with either hand; has excellent return skills and some of the best hands in the draft. The coaches I know at LSU say he could've played any position in their secondary and been a star there too.'

Anyone who has seen the catch Beckham made against the Cowboys would likely agree that the hands comment is perfectly accurate, but saying Beckham Jnr could have been ‘elite’ at soccer/football sounds like hyperbole right? Maybe not.

During the World Cup over the summer, Beckham Jnr said: ‘My coach actually tried to get me on the national team when I was like 13 or 14. But to do the soccer thing, you really have to go overseas and stuff like that, and it was a decision at a young age that I really didn’t want to leave my family.’

‘It was kind of one of those things that I had to let it go even though I still think about it to this day. Soccer is my first love. I haven't done it in a while, but any chance I get to put a soccer ball by my feet, I'll definitely mess around with it.’

That appears to be true...

He may be able to bend it like Beckham, but the former England captain isn’t OBJ’s favourite player. He said: 'I really like Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo (who plays for Portugal’s national team), just respect greatness. Him and (Lionel) Messi from Barcelona (and Argentina).'

If he switches his brand of professional football immediately, Beckham Jnr might have the chance to take on Messi or Ronaldo during the next World Cup in 2018 as a member of the US team. As he proved with his one-handed grab against Dallas, anything is possible.
