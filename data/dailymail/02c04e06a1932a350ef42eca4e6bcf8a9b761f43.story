Saudi Arabia has lifted the ban preventing women from riding motorbikes and bicycles, it has emerged.

The kingdom's religious police are now allowing women to ride bikes in parks and 
recreational areas.

However, they have to be accompanied by a male relative 
and dressed in the full Islamic head-to-toe abaya.

An unnamed official from the powerful religious police told the Al-Yawm daily newspaper that women may not use the 
bikes for transportation but 'only for entertainment'.

He also said they should shun places where young men gather 'to avoid harassment'.

Saudi Arabia follows an ultraconservative interpretation of Islam and bans women from driving.

Women are also banned from riding 
motorcycles or bicycles in public places. The newspaper didn't say what 
triggered the lifting of the ban.

Saudi Arabia is the largest Arab state in Western Asia by land area.

It is the birthplace of Islam and the kingdom is sometimes called 'the Land of the Two Holy Mosques'.

It has the world's second largest oil reserves and oil accounts for more than 95 per cent of exports and an incredible 70 per cent of government revenue.
