Forget the search for life on Mars. Scientists want to know if it is possible to make chips in space.

Greek researchers are to try to fry chips under type of reduced gravity found on Mars or the moon.

They’ve already shown it is possible to make chips at forces three times the normal force of gravity.

Greek researchers claim that frying chips in space would cause them to be soggy rather than crispy because there is no convection in zero gravity

The experiments are funded by the European Space Agency and follow comments from a Russian cosmonaut that what he’d really like is ‘fried potatoes’.

Researcher Thodoris Karapantsios began by using a giant centrifuge to cook chips under conditions of hypergravity, which is when the force of gravity is more than that on Earth.

He found that at a force of 3-g, which is three times the gravity of Earth, the potatoes formed a perfect crispy crust in around half the usual time.

While the chips may not have tasted out of this world, they tasted as good as those fried normally.

The professor, from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, said the same effect could be achieved by creating an industrial fryer that spins once a second or a home fryer that rotates twice a second, and he plans to patent a design.

In the meantime, experiments that recreate the weightlessness of space are planned.

Professor Karapantsios suspects that the potatoes will boil rather than fry but said: ‘It will be important to know whether we can fry on Mars or the moon.’

His experiments are described in the journal Food Research International.
