Ian Wood (on his phone as he leaves Lincoln Magistrates Court). He has been banned from driving after sending sex texts behind the wheel, shortly before a fatal crash

A lorry driver has been banned from driving after he was caught sending 'sex texts' to his lover from behind the wheel, just moments before he was involved in a fatal crash.

A court heard Ian Wood was trying to arrange a rendezvous in a layby with his girlfriend as he drove along a 15-mile route through several villages in the Lincolnshire countryside.

The 43-year-old sent 12 messages as he drove several tonnes of scrap metal from Grantham, Lincolnshire, to Lincoln - breaking speed limits on five different occasions.

Lincoln Magistrates Court heard he sent one sexually explicit message while driving through a village at over 40mph.

After driving six miles away to nearby Bracebridge Heath, Lincolnshire, Wood then tried to arrange a roadside meeting with his partner on November 3 last year.

He then told her: 'Head to Lincoln on the A15 and wait in the first lay-by you come to.'

But before the couple could meet Wood was involved in a fatal collision at 8.51am that morning. 

Lincolnshire Police Special constable Scott Bennett, 24 died after he lost control of his car and smashed into Wood’s lorry near a junction. 

A police investigation found Woods was not to blame for crash but his texts from behind the wheel were unveiled as result of the probe. 

Woods appeared before Lincoln Magistrates Court where he was found guilty of dangerous driving.

Woods - who was pictured using his mobile as he left court - was given a 15-month driving ban.

Magistrates' heard Wood sent his lover the first text on the morning of November 3 after the pair spent the previous night in a hotel together.

He wrote: 'Hope you found it OK.' She replied: 'I did thanks. God it’s really nice.'

Later on, at 7:56 am he wrote: 'Yeah, it (sic) posh. Just went past it 10 minutes ago.'

The pair exchanged more texts throughout the morning before Wood was involved in the collision on the A46.

Police investigations found Woods did not cause the crash and phone records showed the last text to or from his phone was sent 13 minutes beforehand.

But an examination of his truck’s tachograph showed the exchanges happened while Woods was driving at speeds of up to 46 mph.

Wood, from Nocton, denied dangerous driving and told the court: 'I had the telephone in my left hand on the steering wheel.

'I quickly read or sent messages, like glancing at the stereo or oil pressure.

'I was driving on clear roads in top gear with no other traffic about at all.

'I was in complete control of that lorry all the time.'

As well as being banned he was also ordered to do 120 hours unpaid work and pay £100 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

The court heard Wood was sacked from Sims Metal Management in Lincoln where he had worked for 10 years and will lose his current driving job.
