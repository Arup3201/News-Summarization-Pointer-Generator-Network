The NFL could be on the verge of yet another scandal with allegations emerging that one still unidentified player was allowed on the field less than a day after being accused of rape. 

Noted civil rights attorney Gloria Allred gave details of the rape to NFL Commissioner in a letter delivered on Friday as well as asking what the league was aware of.

Allred released a press release stating that she represents 'a young woman who made a police report last Saturday alleging that an NFL player on an NFL team had raped her that morning.'

Noted civil rights attorney Gloria Allred gave details of an alleged rape to NFL Commissioner Friday, claiming the unidentified player and assailant was playing less than 24 hours after the asault

'Thereafter,' she continued, 'the accused was then allowed by his team to play the next day.'

The New York Daily News reports that Allred personally delivered the letter at the NFL's Park Ave. offices.

She said that she was told the package would 'be taken upstairs to (Goodell's) office and delivered to the commissioner immediately.'

She would not detail the letter's exact contents but said she requested a response by Monday.

Allred said she was told the letter would be immediately sent to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, and said she wanted a response by Monday

'Because the criminal investigation is pending and because we want to protect the privacy of our client, we have no comment on the name of the team or the name of the NFL player,' she said.

The Daily News noted that neither the Jets, Bears, Falcons, or Bucs played on the day in question.

Allred said both the alleged victim and player - the latter with a team representative at his side - met with police hours after the attack.

'We have asked
 the NFL whether or not this alleged rape was reported to them and if 
they approved this accused individual’s playing in the game 
notwithstanding the allegations that had been made against him,' she wrote in the release.

Timing couldn't be worse for another scandal as Goodell has already been criticized for his handling of the now infamous Ray Rice elevator assault video

The NFL Players Association did not respond to interview requests.

The allegations could not come at a worse time for the league, which is still reeling from criticism over their mismanagement of ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice and the now infamous video of his violent assault of then-fiancee Janay Palmer.

An NFL spokesman said Allred's letter was the first time they were told about the alleged rape.

'We have no information on this alleged incident other than her letter,' Greg Aiello, league spokesman, said.
