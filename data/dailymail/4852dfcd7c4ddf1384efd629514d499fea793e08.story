Vice President Joe Biden arrived in the Hamptons today for vacation - his third trip away from home in the last two weeks.

President Barack Obama is also on vacation this week at at an elite summer vacation spot: Martha's Vineyard.

The first family arrived on Saturday, and the president has spent three out of the last four days on the golf course with friends.

The only day Obama has not golfed on his trip so far was yesterday. The White House says he went to the beach with his family, instead.

He also made a brief public statement on the state of affairs in Iraq after talking with the country's president and new prime minister and attended a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser.

Obama talked to two world leaders today and hit the links again.

The president was joined on the golf course by his longtime pal Eric Whitaker, former U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, and Cyrus Walker, White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett's cousin.

Obama will remain in Martha's Vineyard through the rest of this week. On Sunday he will return to Washington, D.C. for two days for meetings at the White House. Then he'll go back to Martha's Vineyard to finish out his vacation.

The first family will return to D.C. for good on Sunday, August 24.

Vice President Biden and his wife Jill will remain in the Hamptons - where Bill and Hillary Clinton are also vacationing this month - until next Tuesday, according to a local news report.

Little else is known about the Biden's stay in the Hamptons, and the trip is listed as a visit to Long Island, New York, in Biden's public schedule.

The Hamptons are located in Long Island.

The Bidens just finished
 a five-day retreat in Wyoming yesterday. The couple was spotted going whitewater rafting down the Snake River near Jackson Hole with family and friends during the trip.

Just two weeks ago the Bidens went on a two-day getaway to Rehoboth Beach in Delaware.

During the trips Biden has also continued to hold talks with world leaders, however, and the White House says Biden has spoken over the phone with three Iraqi officials today alone.
