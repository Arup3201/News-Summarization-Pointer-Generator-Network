After his poor response to the Autumn Statement, colleagues are asking if it’s time to go while George Osborne has advised him to stick to playing ‘chopsticks’.

And yesterday, after blustering his way through an interview – with some choice language – Ed Balls took his opponent’s advice, tickling the ivories at a recital.

The Shadow Chancellor, who was forced to postpone his Grade 3 piano exam for last Thursday’s statement, performed Robert Schumann’s Kinderszenen – a piece for children – at a North London arts centre.

Hours earlier, he faced questions from Sky News’s Dermot Murnaghan about reports Labour MPs want him sacked.

Dismissing these as ‘tittle-tattle’, Mr Balls answered: ‘Frankly Dermot, I couldn’t give a t***.’

He
also refused repeatedly to apologise for the way the last Labour 
government piled up debt. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed 
Balls remains in deep denial.’

Mr Balls had revealed last month he 
postponed his Grade Three exam because it fell on the same day his 
opposite number was due give his Autumn Statement.

He said: 'We got the time and date for my Grade three exam two weeks ago. And
can you believe it? It was exactly the time when George Osborne is 
standing up to do the Autumn Statement!

'So I've decided to put the exam 
back to March, because with this concert coming up as well, it's all a 
bit stressful.'

Then, in 
the heated exchanges that followed Mr Osborne's speech on Thursday, Mr Balls 
made a series of jokes, including one about the statement being a 
Christmas 'turkey'.

That riled the Chancellor, who responded with the quip: 'I think he should have gone ahead with the Chopsticks rendition.

'After his performance today I can see why he expects to have a lot more time to practice.'

'Red Ed' then almost blew his top as he yelled himself hoarse trying to defend his economic policy from a series of attacks by Mr Osborne.

Three
days on and Labour's attack dog, has set himself the target of reaching Grade Eight by his 50th birthday, was tinkling the ivories in his debut 
performance at Kings Place, an arts venue in King's Cross, north London.

The concert, organised by the pianist Lucy Parham, included performances by the comedian Alistair McGowan and actors Juliet 
Stevenson, Edward Fox and Simon Russell Beale.

Mr Balls performed a rendition of a movement from composer Robert Schumann's Kinderszenen (Scenes from Childhood) - a piece for children, but far more difficult than Chopsticks.

In October 2012, Mr Balls played a piece called Gavotta on the piano for the LBC 97.3 radio station soon after he had passed his Grade One exam.

And today, Mr Balls claimed Labour was winning the economic argument, saying the massed ranks of Conservative MPs were always going to try to shout down his message.

And he said he ‘couldn't give a toss’ about speculation about his chances of staying in the job, insisting he had ‘never been less bothered’ about ‘gossip and tittle tattle’ about his performance in a 20-year career.

Mr Balls told the Sky News Murnaghan programme: ‘(We have) a really strong economic argument and that's why 300 Tory MPs were going to shout really loudly from the very beginning.

‘I decided I was going to take the argument back to them and say no, there is not a recovery for most working people, living standards are falling. What happened the next day?

‘The Institute of Fiscal Studies effectively confirmed the Chancellor is out of touch saying living standards are going up because for most people, they are going down - I think we are winning the argument.’
