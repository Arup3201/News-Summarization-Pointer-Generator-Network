A library has been forced to employ security guards to clamp down on visitors constantly watching porn on its public computers.

Members of the public are regularly flocking to Boston Library, Lincolnshire, to take advantage of the free internet facilities.

However, library users have reported seeing middle-aged men sitting at the desktop computers shamelessly gawping at x-rated videos.

Crack down: Boston Library in Lincolnshire has employed security guards to stop visitors watching porn on its public computers

As a result, Lincolnshire County Council has now stepped up security in a bid to target visitors watching pornography in the library.

A library source said people accessing explicit images is a 'regular issue' despite the computer's having filters to block adult content.

'We have part-time security guards who are taking on more hours solely to monitor the misuse of computers here,' said the source.

'We have children who use them so it really needs to be stopped.'

Members of the library told today how they had caught users unashamedly watching explicit material at the site, which is based within the council's County Hall.

Neville Jones, 71, said: 'I noticed one man quite openly viewing a pornographic video on one of the computers in full view of other library uses.

'I was rather alarmed and informed a member of staff straight away.'

Another library user, who did not wish to be named, said they witnessed a 'scruffy, middle-aged man' accessing pornographic images last week.

'He was looking at filth,' he said.

'He stunk of drink and was rough and trampy-looking.

'If the staff checked browser history from computer number 10 that day they'd have got an eyeful.'

Earlier this month paedophile Robert Orton, 45, was jailed for two years after a library user spotted him looking at pictures of underage boys on the computers.

Police raided his one-bedroomed flat in Boston and found more than 100,000 indecent images of children.

Jonathan Platt, the council's head of libraries, said: 'We have software in place to help stop people downloading inappropriate material, which works on both English and foreign language sites.

'Anyone misusing our computers will be asked to leave the library, and repeat offenders will be banned.

'If we suspect illegal material has been downloaded, we will report the matter to the police.

'If a customer spots something that concerns them, they should tell a member of staff so they can take the necessary action.

'We continue to employ caretakers and security guards on a part-time basis.'
