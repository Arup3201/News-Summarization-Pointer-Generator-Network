Wanted: Scotland Yard have put out this Efit of a burglar who held a knife to the throat of a baby before taking cash and jewellery

Police are hunting burglars who held a knife to a 15-month-old baby before stealing cash and jewellery in a raid on Halloween, Scotland Yard said today.

A wanted man posed as a meter reader from the water board at a house in Uxbridge, west London, before threatening to stab the owner's daughter.

While holding his knife to the little girl he yelled: 'Where is the gold?' before tying up the 31-year-old woman and locking her in a toilet with her terrified child.

Detectives say the burglar was joined by a female accomplice before searching the property and stealing cash and jewellery at around 5pm on October 31, 

The suspect was wearing an energy company ID  around his neck and a high-visibility jacket, which made the victim believe he was a genuine meter reader. 

The victim showed him where the meters were kept in a cupboard before he attacked them. 

The mother of the baby came out of the family home and said: 'I have been told by the police not to say anything. We don't want to say any more.'

They were found by a neighbour about 50 minutes later and police were called.

The woman who recued them said today: 'Her husband called me from work because he couldn't get in touch with her so my daughter and I went round to see if she was okay.

'We let ourselves in and found her tied up in the bathroom. She was in quite a state and the baby was with her. I don't want to say too much - it was awful.' 

Neighbours say police have since warned them that the burglars are 'targeting Asian families' and are specifically looking for valuable Asian gold.

Heba Kotob, 34, said: 'It is the fourth burglary around here since last December. I don't feel safe in this area anymore'.

Stanley Cross, 54, said police had visited neighbours since the burglary to warn them about a man knocking on doors wearing a high-vis jacket.

The father-of-seven said: 'They came around on Saturday and said to keep an eye out for anyone like that and not to open the door to anyone in uniform.

'The officer said they're targeting people with Asian gold. He said they're targeting Asian families.

'I couldn't believe it when I heard.'

Terrifying: The burglar said he wanted to read a meter before bursting in with a knife demanding: 'Where's the gold?'

Detective Constable Anji Dawson, from Hillingdon police, said: 'Thankfully these types of incidents are very rare and the victim did not suffer any serious injuries. However this was a terrifying burglary which has left the mother of a very young child extremely shaken.

'This incident happened on Halloween at about 5pm, so we believe there may have been many people in the area that may have seen the suspect.

'I would urge anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area or has information on what happened to come forward as soon as possible.

'We know our male suspect was joined by a female once he had put the mother and daughter in the bathroom. The victim did not see his female accomplice, but she did hear her. This woman must have been waiting close by and may well have been seen by someone in the street.'

Police said the woman only realised she was being burgled when she heard her 15-month-old daughter scream. She turned around and saw the suspect holding a knife to her daughter.

The suspect bound the mother's wrists and ankles and put her and her daughter in the bathroom, The Met said. 

Police urgently want to find the man and woman involved in this crime.

The male suspect is white, aged in his early 30s and approximately 5ft 10ins tall. He had a goatee beard and a neck tattoo and spoke with a local London accent. 

He was wearing a blue-coloured fleece with a short sleeved high-visibility jacket, dark trousers, black shoes and a woolly hat.

There is no description of the female accomplice, who was heard, but not seen by the victim.

A spokesman added: 'We remind the public to make sure tradesmen who call at the door are genuine, before they enter your home. Ask to check their identification; if in doubt make them wait at the door and contact the company they work for or the police. 

'Police have conducted numerous house-to-house enquires and increased reassurance patrols in the area'. 

If you have any information please call DC Anji Dawson at Hillingdon Police Station on 020 8246 1529. If you wish to remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
