Ministers are prepared to let the French and German governments hold a stake in the UK’s largest defence company, it emerged yesterday.

At the same time, the Coalition could accept Britain not having an effective stake in the firm to be created by the merger of BAE Systems and Franco-German aviation firm EADS.

The two companies are expected to apply 
for a two-week extension from the stock market today over their plans 
for the £30billion merger.

But with investors in revolt over the deal, the Government admitted it is prepared to give ground to make it happen. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain could tolerate both Paris and Berlin owning 9 per cent of the new company.

And senior Government sources said David Cameron was prepared to ‘hit the phones’ to thrash out a deal with French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

That will enrage the 45 Tory MPs who last week demanded the PM block the deal unless France and Germany sell all their shares. The backlash grew yesterday when BAE’s largest shareholder, Invesco Perpetual, denounced the deal.

In a scathing attack, Invesco’s Neil Woodford said he had ‘significant reservations’ about the deal. His intervention adds to the  opposition to a merger that threatens up to 50,000 UK jobs.

Invesco, which owns 13.3 per cent of 
BAE, warned the company would be ‘driven more by political 
considerations than shareholder value creation’. While Britain would 
retain a so-called ‘golden share’ in the new firm, this will have no 
monetary value and will only theoretically allow a veto on future 
takeovers.

The two companies have until tomorrow to alert the stock market to their detailed plans.

But Mr Hammond said: ‘I don’t think there’s any chance of getting the deal done by Wednesday.

‘We will want to make sure that British jobs, British strategic interests, British defence interests are protected.’

The French and Germans are seeking to 
maintain control of up to 13.5 per cent of the new firm. But Mr Hammond 
said 9 per cent was the maximum the UK would tolerate.

He said: ‘If the French government is 
prepared to reduce its stake and dismantle arrangements that have given 
it the ability to control the company, then with the addition of 
safeguards, a national security agreement, safeguards about where the 
company is headquartered, what the composition of the board will be, I 
think it will be possible to put something together.

‘What we can’t have is this business going forward with the French or German state able to direct its activity. That would not be acceptable.’

A senior Cabinet minister also expressed doubts that a deal could be done with ‘meddling’ European politicians. He said: ‘For French and German politicians it is axiomatic that they should own shares in companies like this.

‘When you say we don’t think it is a role for governments to meddle in the running of these companies they look at you strangely. The problem is that they want a stake and the right to decide where things are built.

‘They don’t understand where we are coming from at all. They are where we were in the 1970s before the Thatcher government.’

The Government’s position puts it at odds with investors and MPs.

Last night Tory MP Ben Wallace said: ‘It is time we stopped listening to bankers and started listening to investors. Did we not learn anything from the financial crisis?’
