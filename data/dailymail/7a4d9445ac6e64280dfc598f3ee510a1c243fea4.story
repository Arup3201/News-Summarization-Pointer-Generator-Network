He's on our team: Pensions Minister Steve Webb says God is a Liberal Democray

He is said to move in mysterious ways and, at last, there may be an explanation why.

For, according to pensions minister Steve Webb, God is a Liberal Democrat. Although the party has been languishing in single figures in the polls, he argues that, in the long term, it has the support of the Almighty.

Writing in a new book about the party’s relationship with Christianity, Mr Webb says it is clear from the Bible that God shares the Lib Dems’ core beliefs.

‘The most fundamental reason why Christians should feel at home in the Liberal Democrats is that the character of God, as revealed in the Christian Gospel, would suggest that God must be a liberal,’ he writes.

‘This assertion will shock or offend some but I believe there is no other conclusion that can be drawn from the New Testament.’ He goes on: ‘Those who recognise in the Gospel a deep reverence for human freedom and self-determination will find a natural home in the Liberal Democrats.’

His comments come in a new book of essays, Liberal Democrats Do God. The title is a riposte to former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell who famously banned questions about Tony Blair’s religious faith by telling reporters: ‘We don’t do God’.

Despite Mr Webb’s eye-catching claims the book is unlikely to feature on Nick Clegg’s reading list, since the Lib Dem leader has declared himself an atheist.

But party president Tim Farron appears to back Mr Webb, citing a call to Christian’s by Peter to ‘engage with politics’.

Writing in the new book, Mr Farron says: Liberal Democrats stand alone as the defender of the rights of all human beings’.

But writing in the same book the Catholic MP Greg Mulholland warns that the Lib Dems have become ‘anti-religious’ and ‘illiberal’ in their rejection of Christianity.

‘I fear that what we are heading towards now in the party is away from freedom of conscience and towards a new moral conformity,’ he writes.

Mr Webb is also taken to task by a prominent Lib Dem councillor who pointed out that ‘virtually every political tradition under the sun has at some time claimed the Almighty as their own.’

Lester Holloway, a councillor in Sutton and former editor of the Black newspaper New Nation, said: ‘History is littered with assorted dodgy Christian tribes hanging their noxious beliefs on particular Bible passages. Indeed slavery and forced conversion was justified on such grounds.

‘Webb’s interpretation is, of course, grounded on a wider reading of the Bible yet so too is a Conservative take on the Bible.’

Mr Holloway went on: ‘The party is led by a man who has declared he doesn’t believe in God yet his belief in the Tories seems to be stronger. I don’t suppose God believes in suicide yet several disabled people have done just that after (eligibility) tests imposed by the department of which Webb is a minister of state.’
