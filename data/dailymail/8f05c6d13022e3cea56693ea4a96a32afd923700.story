If you're a Facebook user, chances are there are one or two people in your friends’ list that you wouldn’t want to spend time with in real life.

And a poll has discovered that the reason we keep these so-called ‘famicable’ friends on the site is purely so we can snoop on what they’re up to.

The survey found that 68 per cent of users have Facebook friends they don’t like - and almost half would actively avoid these people in the street.

The poll was carried out by New York-based CouponCodesPro. Of 2,570 U.S. users surveyed, 68% said they are friends with people on Facebook they don't like, and the top reason was because they wanted to snoop on what the other persons was up to

But the group admitted they didn’t want to unfriend them because they wouldn’t be able to be nosey.

When asked why users refuse to delete Facebook friends they don't like, the following reasons were:

1. I like to see what they’re up to - 69 per cent

2. They’re family, or a loved one’s family member - 57 per cent

3. They’re a colleague or former colleague that I need to stay in contact with - 54 per cent

4. They’d cause a scene if I deleted them as a friend - 50 per cent

5. Having them as a friend lets me see what others are doing, for example my children - 31 per cent 

Other reasons included that the person was a family member, work colleague, or the ‘friend’ would cause a scene if they were deleted.

More than 2,570 American adults who regularly use social media took part in the poll, which quizzed them about how they used their social media accounts.

All respondents in the Money saving site CouponCodesPro survey were asked to reveal how many Facebook friends they had at the time of the poll, and the average was 671.

When asked how many contacts on the site they would consider to be true friends, respondents said an average of just 18 - not even 3 per cent of their entire friends list.

All respondents were then asked to elaborate, and when asked ‘Are you friends with anyone on social media that you dislike but are falsely amicable with online?’, more than two thirds (68 per cent) said yes.

When respondents were asked 'Would you go out of your way to avoid the Facebook friends you dislike in real life?' (stock image pictured) almost half said yes. And when asked roughly how many Facebook friends they had that met this criteria, the average response was 19

When the relevant respondents were asked ‘Would you go out of your way to avoid the Facebook friends you dislike in real life?’ almost half said yes.

And when asked roughly how many Facebook friends they had that met this criteria, the average was 19.

According to the poll, 20 per cent of Facebook users have also taken part in an argument on the site, and almost half said the reason was due to a vague status they thought was aimed at them.

George Charles, spokesperson for CouponCodesPro.com, said: ‘The results of this study are  interesting; just the fact alone that so many of us are friends with people on Facebook that we don’t really like and would go out of our way to avoid.

‘As a society, we share so much personal information on social media and there’s an increasingly overwhelming need to stay up-to-date with what everyone is up to in their lives, whether they’re our friends or not.

‘Something worth noting that is that if you’re using social media to keep an eye on what others are doing, there’s a very real chance people are doing the same to you.'
