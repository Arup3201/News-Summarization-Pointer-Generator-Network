Died from multiple injuries: Ellie Tweed was killed when a car being driven by her friend smashed into the back of a lorry in Norfolk last year

A teenage girl found dead in a car 
which burst into flames after the driver crashed following a 
drug-fuelled Halloween party was killed before the fire broke out, an 
inquest heard today.

Ellie Tweed, 18, was the front-seat 
passenger in a Fiat Punto driven by her friend Eleanor Coleman, 19, when
it crashed on November 1 last year.

The car swerved off the road and hit the 
back of a lorry parked in a lay-by on the A47 at North Burlingham, 
Norfolk, at 5.20am while Coleman was high on ecstasy and cannabis.

Flames engulfed the smashed car with unconscious Ellie trapped inside, while a lorry driver managed to pull Coleman free.

Ellie was unrecognisable when her body was retrieved from the blaze.

However, an inquest into Ellie’s death concluded the teenager had died before the flames broke out.

The
hearing in Norwich was told a post-mortem examination found Ellie had 
died from multiple injuries from the impact of the crash.

Coleman,
who managed to escape the fire, had been at a Halloween party taking 
drugs and was jailed for 15 months earlier this year after admitting 
death by careless driving.

Ellie, of Hemsby, Nofolk, was sat in 
the front passenger seat of the car, which was travelling at about 40mph
along the single carriageway, which has a 50 mph speed limit.

Experts told the inquest that there was no evidence of the car braking before it crashed into the HGV.

Lorry driver Peter Jolly had turned off all of the lights of his vehicle, breaking rules for sidelights to remain switched on.

However, the inquest ruled it was not clear whether that had contributed to the crash.

Recording
a narrative verdict, the city’s deputy assistant coroner David Osborne,
said: 'The balance of probability suggests that Ellie Louise Tweed was 
effectively dead before the fire took hold.

'In
light of that evidence and also given the fact that there have been 
criminal proceedings to which the driver pleaded guilty, Ellie Louise 
Tweed died as a result of a road traffic collision when the vehicle in 
which she was the front seat passenger collided with a stationary HGV.

'The cause of death was multiple injuries.'

Mr
Osborne added: 'I would like to offer my condolences to the family of 
Ellie Louise Tweed for their loss in exceedingly tragic circumstances.'

Coleman was sentenced to 15 months 
custody in a young offenders’ institution and given a three-year driving
ban at Norwich Crown Court on October 24.

A letter written by Coleman, read 
aloud in court, said: 'I hate myself for everything that has happened 
and will never forgive myself.'
