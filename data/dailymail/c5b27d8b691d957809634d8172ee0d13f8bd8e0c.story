Buried beneath the Turkish city of Sardis, archaeologists have discovered what is believed to be an ancient lucky charm, designed to ward off evil spirits.

Despite being buried around 2,000 years ago, the two pots are relatively intact and one contains the remains of a perfectly preserved, fragile eggshell.

The region was destroyed by an earthquake in AD 17 and it is thought the egg was a ritual offering, used to protect the area from future disasters.

There have been many reports of eggs 
being used in ancient rituals, with particular reference to ‘uncrossing’
 and warding off demons.

Uncrossing is the act of undoing 
curses, or reversing bad fortune.

The U.S. archaeologists believe the 
residents of Sardis would have placed the eggs in the ground to 
reverse the bad fortune the earthquake had subjected on the region.

It may have also been seen as an 
offering to the gods, to help ward off demons and evil spirits that 
would want to harm the region.

Eggshells were additionally used in so-called ‘demon traps’ in modern-day Iraq and Iran to disarm evil forces.

Whole eggs were used to place curses on enemies.

Residents of Sardis rebuilt the region following this earthquake, and the settlement remained for centuries until it was finally abandoned in the 1402.

The discovery of the pots was made by archaeologists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Missouri in partnership with the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis.

The artefacts were found buried beneath what would have been an elite building in the city that was once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia.

In addition to the eggshell, the researchers also found small bronze tools and a coin.

The eggshell had been deliberately pierced, to allow the insides to flow out, but the rest of the shell had remained in one piece.

Elsewhere, the coin features a symbol believed to be the goddess Cybele.

Cybele was linked with the earth, and in particular the mountains, and this offering may have been to appeal to her for protection.

Elizabeth Raboult from the University of Missouri told Live Science that the objects give a unique insight into how the earthquake would have affected the residents of Sardis.

She said: ‘It's one person's way of coping with the uncertainties and tumultuous events of that period’ and added that the find was ‘really fantastic.’

The Sardis settlement, found in 
modern-day Sart, was situated in the middle of Hermus 
valley, at the foot of Mount Tmolus. Excavations have previously uncovered a bath-gym complex and a synagogue in the region.

In A.D 17, under the reign of Tiberius, Sardis was destroyed by an earthquake and the whole area had to be rebuilt.
