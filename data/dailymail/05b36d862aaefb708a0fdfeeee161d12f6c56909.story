A Chinese council has built a giant outdoor escalator to take wealthy residents of a posh hill-top estate to their homes without having to take the stairs.

The construction, built in the heart of the south-western Chinese city of Chongqing, has been criticised by engineers for being too exposed to the elements.

The escalator was built following a series of complaints from the residents of the hill-top condominium development, but the council says they did not affect their decision.

Stairway to heaven: The residents of a posh hill-top estate no longer have to walk up the hill to their homes

The council has been accused of bowing to the demands from inhabitants of the newly built estate  by putting a huge escalator directly to their doors.

People living on the hilltop with a panorama view of Chongqing had complained they faced a long walk after coming out of the local underground station in order to get home.

And although a stairway had already been put in, the council finally backed down and agreed to put in a huge escalator up the hillside.

Engineers spent three months planning and extending the escalator from the underground station so that it carried on up the hillside, and it is now in operation despite criticism of the fact that the exposed escalator was at risk from the elements.

No pressure: The council in Chongqing said the building of the escalators had nothing to do with the residents on the posh estate on top of the hill complaining about having to walk

Set to fail? Engineers have complained that the escalators are too exposed and at risk from the elements

There was already a staircase in place, but after residents complained, an escalator was also built

One engineer told local media: 'In autumn it is going to get covered in leaves, in winter it will be covered in snow and in the summer there will be rain flooding down. 

'I would imagine the operators of this escalator will have an uphill struggle to keep it going.

A government spokesman said: 'The decision to put escalator was nothing to do with influential people that live at the top of the hill, it was simply the fact that we want to provide a service to commuters. 

'The escalators exist inside the underground station, so it was logical to also consider putting one that continued up the side of the hill.'
