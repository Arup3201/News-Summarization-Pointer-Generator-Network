A violent prisoner has had a free sex change operation on the NHS which will cost taxpayers £10,000, it has emerged.

Alan Baker is now in the vulnerable ­prisoner wing at Elmley jail on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, calling himself Sarah.

Once the 43-year-old's controversial gender change has been completed, he will be transferred to a women’s prison.

Controversial: Violent prisoner Alan Baker has had a free sex change operation on the NHS which will cost taxpayers £10,000. He now wants to be known as Sarah

Baker, originally from Croydon, South London, was initially locked up for kidnapping and torturing his step-mother’s brother.

But after trying to kill an alleged child rapist behind bars in 1998 he is now serving an indeterminate sentence.

The cost of keeping the violin-playing thug in jail has already reached £1million.

He has previously boasted about having free food, healthcare and laundry as well as free access to an Open ­University course .

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Baker 
has complained about being a target for violence since announcing he is 
to become a woman, saying how he feels vulnerable.

'Prison
is brutal and it’s all about being the hardest and the most macho.

'If 
you tell a member of staff you feel threatened, nothing will happen 
until you are beaten up.

'People are not well educated or liberal in the way they think in jail and the rules are outdated.'

Critics have been left furious that the prisoner was allowed to have the operation.

The chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, Matthew Sinclair, said: 'Expensive treatment on the NHS must be based on medical need.

'Saving lives should come at the very top of the list.

'If such a procedure is provided, law-abiding patients facing longer waiting lists to get urgent medical care will find that deeply unfair.'

It normally costs about £10,000 to have a sex change on the NHS.

Prisoners have the same rights to the procedure as normal citizens.

A
Prison Service spokesman told the Daily Mirror that staff are required 
to deal with transgendered prisoners in accordance with the law.

Baker
has published a book called Life Imprisonment, an Unofficial Guide in 
which he expresses remorse for this previous crimes.

He will have a parole hearing in October.
