There was an hour of daylight left in the Omani desert when we hopped into the Land Cruiser. Our guide, Zubair, revved the engine — in another life he might have been a rally driver — and off we set.

'Dune bashing!' cried Zubair, encouraged by squawks of delight from our youngest daughter, aged ten.

Oman's Wahiba Sands are classic desert terrain — the sort you get in a David Lean film or one of those 'parched man crawls towards oasis' newspaper cartoons. Hillocks of sand stretched to the horizon.

What was most striking was the colours, at once uniform and subtly different. The sand was all yellow, of course, but there were valleys of brown and black, too, lengthening as the golden sun dropped.

Zubair drove with gusto. We surged over and through the dunes. It was like skiing. 'Snowplough!' I yelled when we seemed to be going down far too steep an incline and the car, thrillingly, was skidding sideways, throwing out a high spray of sand.

Our children cackled with laughter. Zubair grinned broadly. My wife screamed.

The moment we stepped out of the 4x4, there came a contrast: complete, refreshing silence as we sat on the dune tops and watched the sun set on this astonishing landscape. 

This was the reason I'd dug deep into the family savings and chosen Oman for a week's holiday over New Year. It lived up to every expectation.

The Sultanate of Oman, long an ally of Britain, lies east of Saudi Arabia. To its south is troubled Yemen. British Airways flights from Heathrow take seven hours to reach the Omani capital Muscat.

FOR the first four days, we had the company of speedmerchant Zubair. He took us to the fortified town of Nizwa, where a splendidly busy and smelly livestock market is held on Fridays.

The nut sellers in the souk had copped on to the idea of overcharging Western tourists — when my wife asked for a small bag of cashews, she was charged the Omani rial equivalent of £3. 

'You should have haggled,' I said. She told me she would have felt mean. 'They expect and enjoy haggling,' insisted Zubair. 

Nizwa has a restored fort that could have been the setting for Carry On Up The Khyber. I was half expecting to find Kenneth Williams round the next turret.

Even better than Nizwa's fort was the one at Jabrin, where a 17th-century sultan reclined with dates, concubines and political worries. 

His reception room had hidey holes from which his henchmen could pounce to slay visitors. And his fortifications had gizmos worthy of James Bond: false steps on stairs down where attackers might plunge to their deaths, and 'killing holes' through which boiling-hot date syrup could be poured.

The beautiful Sun And Moon room, meanwhile, was cleverly designed to keep the ruler cool by day and silver-lit by night.

Arid Oman's mountains are a purpling grey, and water is precious. Where the irrigation projects have not yet reached, you see blue water lorries labouring up roads. Government infrastructure work is everywhere.

Since 1970, the country has been wrenched from medieval times into the 21st century, yet its people remain gracious and attractively modest. 

Although Western tourists are welcomed, women are urged to dress discreetly in the streets (no short skirts, low-cut tops or bare shoulders). Nor would you ever go to Oman for a Western stag night — alcohol is not plentiful.

Our accommodation at the View Camp was odd — freezing cold, prefab huts with mod-con bathrooms worthy of a London hotel. But true to its name, it had a fine view of the plain below.

The nearby village of Misfat was a delight, an oasis perched on a hill with banana trees and palms. 

My wife was so enchanted by one deep-gorge wadi we visited that she has kept drawing pictures of it since we got home.

In the desert, we stayed at another camp where the sleeping quarters were Bedouin-style tents, and evening entertainment was provided by a discordant band of bongo drummers and overweight dancing ladies.

The opulent Al Waha Hotel at Shangri-La's Barr Al Jissah Resort and Spa, Sultanate of Oman

For supper, the staff produced a side of spiced lamb that had been cooking for 24 hours. Gosh, it was cold that night. But our children found it all fascinating — and they even got to grips with a few hesitant words of Arabic.

The least interesting part of the trip was when we returned towards Muscat and had a few nights at the opulent (but pricey) Al Waha Hotel.

Great pools, comfortable rooms, but we could have been in Western Europe, complete with a clientele of bored white bankers and their pouting girlfriends.

We did manage to escape into the city, however, and visit the souk, with its goodly whiff of frankincense, the fish market (rather different smells there) and the Grand Mosque, which was completed in 2001.

The chandelier in the mosque's main chamber has more than 1,000 bulbs — just think of the electricity bills!

The mosque complex, which can accommodate 20,000 worshippers, is a monument to cultural and national selfconfidence in a country blessed with rich natural resources and a lingering Arabian mystique.
