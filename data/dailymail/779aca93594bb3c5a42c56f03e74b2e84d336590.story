Negotiating the London Underground can be a trying ordeal at the best of times.

But it all got a little bit too much for this 'drunk' businessman who was so determined to reach his platform he attempted to walk the wrong way down an escalator.

A fellow commuter captured this footage of the businessman, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase, trying to ride down to the tube on a escalator moving upwards at Tottenham Court Road.

On the road to nowhere: A 'drunk' businessman attempts to walk the wrong way down an escalator

Helping hand: A fellow commuter attempts to tell the unnamed man he is going the wrong way at Tottenham Court Road tube station

Despite moving absolutely nowhere, the unnamed man continues to take on the escalator with dogged determination.

And he keeps going even when several other passengers point out he is walking the wrong way.

One good Samaritan makes several attempts to lead him off the escalator but the businessman takes no notice and continues on his fruitless journey.

After struggling for more than two minutes as 
people push past - he is guided off by a helpful commuter who pushes the
 emergency stop button and points him in the right direction.

The incident was caught on camera last Friday by Sam Napper, 27, who described the man as a 'drunk Japanese businessman'.Â

Sam, from London, said: 'I was making my way home after dinner when we quite literally bumped into this chap on the escalators between the Northern and Central Lines at Tottenham Court Road station.

'At first I thought he was playing silly buggers with a few of his FX Trader mates but then we saw his dogged stagger and realised he was alone.

'One by one, concerned commuters tried to steer him in the right direction, to no avail.

'Eventually, someone pushed the emergency stop button.

'After pausing for a few seconds, he turned around and walked out, as if nothing ever happened, saying nothing, leaving us stunned.'

Bemused: Several other passengers try to point out the man's error but he doesn't appear to listen
