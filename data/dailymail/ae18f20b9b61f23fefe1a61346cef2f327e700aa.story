As many as 75 scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta may have been exposed to dangerous anthrax bacteria because of a safety problem at one of its labs.

Agency officials at the U.S. federal government labs say the risk of infection is low, but that all of the potentially affected staff members are being monitored or given antibiotics as a precaution.

The issue occurred when bacteria samples that were not completely inactivated were moved from a higher level biosafety lab to a lower level one that was not designed to handle such samples.

The problem was discovered last Friday, 
when live anthrax bacteria were found on some materials being gathered 
for disposal, the CDC said in a statement.

Dr Paul Meechan, director of the environmental health and safety compliance office at the CDC, told Reuters that after the discovery, the agency immediately began contacting individuals working in the labs who may have unknowingly handled live anthrax bacteria.

'No employee has shown any symptoms of anthrax illness,' Meechan said.

He added that the normal incubation period can take up to five to seven days, though there are documented cases of the illness occurring some 60 days after exposure.

Symptoms of anthrax infection differ depending on how the victim comes into contact with the bacteria - through touching, inhaling or consuming.

If the subject touches the anthrax, symptoms usually start within seven days and can include itchy sores that form blisters and swelling. Immediate treatment is necessary as 20 per cent of those who touch anthrax may die if it spreads to their blood.

If the victim inhales the anthrax, they might suffer from a fever, headache, cough, shortness of breath and chest pain. The outlook is bleaker for those who inhale it - with up to 90 per cent of cases becoming fatal.

If someone consumes meat infected with anthrax, symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea and mouth sores and, again, treatment is vital because anthrax in the blood system is fatal.

To test for anthrax, skin cultures or biopsies can be taken, as well as chest x-rays or spinal taps. If anthrax is found, antibiotics can be used to treat it.

Meechan said as many as seven 
researchers may have come into direct contact with the live anthrax, but
 the agency is casting as wide a net as possible to make sure all 
employees at the agency who may have walked into any of the labs at risk
 are being offered treatment.

Around 75 individuals are being offered a 60-day course of treatment with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin as well as an injection with an anthrax vaccine.

Meechan said it is too early to determine whether the transfer was accidental or intentional.

He said all employees who were doing procedures to inactivate the bacteria were working in a biosecurity laboratory and were 'tier one select agent approved,' meaning they had undergone a security reliability review and deemed to be 'stable, trustworthy individuals'.

Meechan said the CDC is conducting an internal investigation to discover how the exposure occurred and said disciplinary measures would be taken if warranted.

'This should not have happened,' he said. For those exposed, he said: 'We're taking care of it. We will not let our people be at risk.'

If scientists came into contact with the anthrax, they could experience a range of symptoms, including blisters, shortness of breath, fever and chest pain.

According to LiveScience, anthrax infection kills due to the toxins the bacteria produced when they're in the body. A recent study revealed that the toxins, lethal toxin and edema toxin, attack the cells of the heart muscle and the liver.

The toxins can penetrate immune cells, killing them and slowly breaking down the body's defense system, which causes hemorrhaging that floods the lungs - making it difficult to breathe - and poisons the bloodstream.

The victim must be treated immediately because once it's in the bloodstream, it can be fatal.
