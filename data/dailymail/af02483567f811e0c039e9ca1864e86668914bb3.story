investigations: The French Foreign office is investigating reports that geologist Philippe Verdon was beheaded by terror group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb on March 10

Al Qaeda terrorists today claimed to have beheaded a French hostage in retaliation for his country’s war in Mali.

Foreign Office officials in Paris said they were trying to verify reports of the horrific death of Philippe Verdon, who has been in captivity for the past 14 months.

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which is waging a terrorist campaign against the French Army in Mali, claims it cut the geologist’s head off on March 10 ‘in response to France’s intervention in Northern Mali.’

Referring to Francois Hollande, a spokesman for the group calling himself Al-Qairawani added: ‘The French President Hollande is responsible for the lives of the other French hostages.’

There are at least 14 French hostages currently held by Al Qaeda in west Africa, including seven by AQIM.

It means that France, which has already lost five soldiers fighting in Mali since the war started in January, is slowly being sucked into an increasingly bloody terrorist war.

Mr Hollande sent a force into Mali specifically to prevent the north of the country from being used as a launch pad for terror attacks in Africa and in the West.

Mr Verdon, who is in his 50s, was captured on November 24 2011 along with Serge Lazarevic, a colleague.

The men, who were on a business trip, were kidnapped from their hotel in Hombori, in the north of Mali. 

AQIM claimed that both men were secret agents or mercenaries, and later released a video of Mr Verdon in captivity.

The hostages’ families have expressed growing fears about the men’s safety, especially following the invasion of Mali.

On Monday, Mr Verdon’s father 
Jean-Pierre Verdon said: ‘We are in a total fog and it is impossible to 
live this way. We have no information.’

Captured: Mr Verdon has been held captive for 14 months, having been captured on November 24 2011 along with colleague Serge Lazarevic

No information: On Monday, Mr Verdon¿s father Jean-Pierre Verdon said: ¿We are in a total fog and it is impossible to live this way. We have no information¿

The Verdon family were particularly concerned by Mr Hollande’s firm announcement that France would not pay ransoms.

French forces arrived in Mali on January 11 to help the Malian Army against Al-Qaeda fighters who had controlled the north of the country since April 2012.

France now has more than 4,000 troops on the ground in Mali, most carrying out clean-up operations after driving out most of the Islamist rebels from the area.

Senior Al-Qaeda commanders Mokhtar Belmokhtar and Abdelhamid Abou Zeid are believed to have been killed in Mali earlier this month.

A rescue operation ordered by Mr Hollande to free a French secret agent held hostage in Somalia since mid-2009 ended in failure in January after he was killed along with two French soldiers.
