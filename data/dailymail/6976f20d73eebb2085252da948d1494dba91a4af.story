Charlie Austin has stunned QPR by indicating he will not decide on a £60,000-a-week contract offer until the summer.

Harry Redknapp’s relegation-threatened side are desperate to tie Austin to a new deal having seen him score 13 times in the Barclays Premier League this season.

Although Austin remains committed to keeping Rangers in the top flight, he has less than 18 months left on his contract at Rangers and is prepared to wait until the end of the season before deciding on his future.

And that will inevitably alert other Premier League clubs with Austin holding all the aces in negotiations with QPR chairman Tony Fernandes.

Austin is way behind some of the biggest earners at Loftus Road.

Joey Barton is the highest-paid player at QPR on £90,000-a-week and Croatian winger Niko Kranjcar is on just over £60,000.

Austin signed a three-year deal worth £28,000-a-week when he joined from Burnley in a £4million move in 2013.

Rangers are in a relegation battle at the foot of the Premier League and Austin is one of the players they are relying on to get them clear of danger.

Austin, who began his career in non-league football with Hungerford Town and Poole Town, has been tipped for a place in Roy Hodgson’s England squad for their next Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Lithuania in March.

He is the leading English goalscorer in the Premier League and is behind only Chelsea’s Diego Costa (15) and Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero (14).
