TVNZ reports that the competitors used light poles, scaffolding, and a colorful costumes in this weekend's Miss Pole Dance South America competition.

While poll dancing is often associated with strip dancing, the Miss Pole Dancing South America competition approaches the sport from an athletic perspective. 

The winner will go on to compete at the World Pole Dance Championships early next year.
