A pensioner has lost a bitter legal battle with a multi-millionaire Tory peer over a patch of land next to his recycling yard that he has used for more than 17 years.

Tom McAllister, 68, said he decided to clear the disused plot, which was used as a dumping ground, after he was unable to find the legal owner in government records.

But lawyers insisted the land in Rigside, Lanarkshire, belonged to the estate of David Douglas-Home, son of ex-Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home, and took legal action against Mr McAllister.

Mr McAllister, who runs a pallet recycling firm, said he spent around £10,000 clearing the 0.3 acre site and had been using it to park his trailers and to hand out free firewood to the local community.

Lawyers acting for Lord Home, former chairman of private bank Coutts & Co, said the land was part of the Douglas Estate, and an adjoining estate owned by the Carmichael family.

Mr McAllister was ordered to vacate the site in Rigside, Lanarkshire, but appealed all the way to the Court of Session where judges have now found in Lord Home's favour.

Today, Mr McAllister told of his disappointment at the outcome and said he was bracing himself to be thrown off the land.

He said: 'I can't believe I was dragged to court over this in the first place but when the decision went against us we decided to take it all the way.

'This will mean that I will be thrown off the land and it will cost me a fortune.

In a written judgement, Lord Carloway found that the two estates had a valid title to the land near Mr McAllister's business (above) as he could not produce definitive evidence that it was owned by another party

'I have been portrayed as a squatter but I have looked after the land for 17 years when nobody else was bothering with it.

'It's a piece of land which is of no use to the estate but they have been determined to remove me from it. I'm really disappointed, I think it's ridiculous.'

He added: 'We have been here for 17 years and have spent a lot of time and money clearing the site which was previously a dumping ground.

'We checked with the Registers of Scotland and couldn't find a clean title for the land so we decided to clear it ourselves.

'We use the site to park trailers and to dispense fire wood for free to the local community, which is much appreciated in an area of high unemployment.'

In a written judgement, Lord Carloway found that the two estates had a valid title to the land as Mr McAllister could not produce definitive evidence that it was owned by another party.

Lord Home had earlier sparked fury by brokering a deal to let Scottish Coal mine his land in Lanarkshire for a fee.

In 2012 environmental protesters invaded the ground of his mansion on the estate and dug up his lawn.

Yesterday, no one from Douglas and Angus Estates, Lord Home's family business that manages the estate, was available for comment.

The estate's factor Henry Birch has previously said that they believe they are the legal owners of the land along with the Carmichael estate and had offered in the past to lease it to Mr McAllister.

The Douglas family's connections can be traced back to 767 AD when Sholto Duglass 'turned' a battle in favour of King Solvathuis.

But it is William Douglas, born in 1174, who is widely acknowledged as the founder of the Black Douglas family and the Douglas Estates.

The Earls of Home can boast similar lineage to the Douglases. The family are associated with the Hirsel Estate, which was purchased from Sir William Ker in 1611 by the first Earl of Home.

The two families and the two estates came together in 1832 when Lady Lucy Montagu Douglas married Cospatrick Alexander Home – the 11th Earl of Home.

The union resulted in the joining of the Estates – geographically separate, but run as a single integrated trading business. The set-up is one that remains today. 

The estates are focused on the Hirsel at Coldstream and Douglas in South Lanarkshire, extending to about 36,000 acres. 

The Douglas Estate in South Lanarkshire has been the seat of the Douglas family for some 800 years. But the fortunes of the estate ebbed and flowed with each generation.

Douglas Castle, which once stood on the estate, was sieged, destroyed, burnt down before it was finally demolished in 1938 – leaving behind it only the remains of Castle Dangerous (built in 1457).

In 1689 James, Earl of Angus, raised the Cameronian Regiment - later to be known as the Scottish Rifles - at Braidlea in Douglas. The Regiment served both their country for 300 years before being disbanded at Douglas in 1968.
