She triggered a torrent of online debate when she was pictured weightlifting eight months pregnant.

But Los Angeles mother Lea-Ann Ellison has delivered a triumphant blow to her 'haters' by giving birth to a healthy baby boy.

Skyler weighed seven pounds and three ounces - although if he is anything like his mother, it won't be long before he is piling on the muscle.

Ms Ellison, who has declared she wants to be a 'Hot Mom', gave birth to Skyler on November 7 in her home using a birthing pool - and kept exercising until just three days beforehand.

Since the birth she has already returned to the gym and her CrossFit regime, a system of exercises created 13 years ago and now used by thousands of gyms worldwide.

Skyler was her second 'water baby' and came into the world a day before his due date surrounded by midwives, her husband Shane, her son and her daughter.

Her husband joked: 'Blair, my eight-year-old son, said the tub looked like a shark attack.'

He added: 'Pregnancy is unmerited sacrifice. Only the strongest women can do it with grace and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of seeing my wife do it three times.'

Posting on Facebook, the body-builder said: 'We welcomed our new son into the world yesterday! Skyler was born at 3:44pm at home into my loving and welcoming hands.

'Skyler is a very chill dude and super easy going. Looks a lot like his sister too. Thank you for all of the support and I look forward to sharing this chapter of my life with you!'

Royal College of Midwives spokesman Janet Fyle said: 'She's quite far along in her pregnancy so there can't really be any problem with it, and if she's always done weightlifting I don't think it would suddenly bring on early labour.

'Obviously we aren't advising pregnant women to take up weightlifting if they've never done it before, but if she's used to the exercise it's OK.

'We always say if women were riding bikes or going to the gym before they were pregnant they can continue to do so, they just need to tell their instructor they are pregnant and then they can adjust the exercises.

'I understand why people might be concerned, but if the woman doesn't want to stop doing her exercise that's fine.'

She added: 'Take that haters! Ha ha ha!'

While some appeared to support her decision in September - including several people who claimed to be doctors - others were horrified.

'This is actually sickening,' wrote Amanda Cinq-Mars. 'I hope pregnant [women] around the world do not do this kind of cr**.

'I am a crossfit enthusiast but I DO NOT recommend this at all. Doctors always strongly suggest to not lift heavy because you can sever your placenta and cause major damage an early labour and miscarriage... Posting this picture goes people the wrong message that this is OKAY when it's not!'

Another, Josh Giannapolous, wrote: 'Cross fit? This goes way beyond a way of life, and right into an obsession.

'She is very selfish for endangering a life for her own personal gains and achievements. This is not a proud picture to post.

'That amount of weight lifted above the head is extremely dangerous while pregnant. Cross fit is a hobby, not a necessity to life. It's becoming unconscious to the dangers of reality.'

Users who sprang to her defence included Katy McNiff Nicholas, who wrote: 'You go girl! Looking great!!! Much better than a lot of obese pregnant ladies with high blood pressure and diabetes who get short of breath walking up a flight of steps.'

Controversial: Lea-Ann Ellison provoked debate when she posted photos of herself lifting weights

Body-building: Ms Ellison was pictured lifting heavy kettlebells above her head just weeks before she was due

Ms Ellison is not the only workout-loving mother-to-be to make headlines after her pregnancy regime came to light.

Four years ago Cambridgeshire fitness enthusiast Sarah-Jane Cousins hit the front pages after being pictured lifting 15kg dumbbells with just 11 days to go before her due date.

Another mother criticised for continuing a tough fitness regime throughout her pregnancy was model Nell McAndrew, who was stunned at the backlash she received after competing in a gruelling marathon while 20 weeks pregnant.

Speaking to MailOnline after the marathon in November last year, McAndrew said: 'When I tell people I'm still exercising, they react as if I've told them I've been smoking or drinking alcohol while pregnant.

'But what I'm doing is actually good for me and my baby.'

Nell's belief that fitness aids labour is backed up by studies that have found that babies of women who exercise are better off when it comes to their birth because 'foetuses of exercising women may tolerate labour better than those of non-exercisers,' according to The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).

Along with official NHS guidelines that recommend 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day for expectant mothers, the RCOG also advocates exercise where there are no complications in the pregnancy.

Precautions like not exercising at a high intensity or running when it is too hot should also be taken.

The Royal College guidelines said: 'In most cases, exercise is safe for both mother and fetus during pregnancy and women should therefore be encouraged to initiate or continue exercise to derive the health benefits associated with such activities.'

They add that it is untrue that exercise increases the risk of miscarriage or damage to an unborn baby.

The guidelines add: 'Additionally, active women experience less insomnia, stress, anxiety and depression.'
