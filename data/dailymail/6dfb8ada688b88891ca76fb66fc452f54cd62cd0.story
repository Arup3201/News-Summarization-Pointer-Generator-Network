Recovering: Margaret Thatcher, pictured on her 87th birthday, is recuperating at The Ritz

When she was at the peak of her powers, the last place you would have expected to find Margaret Thatcher was in a luxury suite in a five-star hotel enjoying a well-earned rest.

The former prime minister famously survived on only four hours sleep a night when she was in Downing Street and was deeply reluctant even to go on holiday.

But since she was discharged from hospital last week, after minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder, Lady Thatcher, 87, has been quietly convalescing in a suite at The Ritz hotel in central London.

The Iron Lady is now increasingly frail and uncertain on her feet so there were fears she would not be able to manage the stairs at her elegant four-storey Belgravia home.

The Ritz has always been one of her favourite places and she has been invited to stay there for the forseeable future.

Staff have done their best to make it home from home and her two carers are taking it in turns to stay with her.

Britain’s first and only woman prime minister, who won three consecutive general elections, has been in fragile health since she suffered a series of minor strokes more than a decade ago. She suffers acute short-term memory loss.

A close friend of Lady Thatcher said: ‘The operation was a complete success but it was physically very draining. It is much easier for Lady Thatcher to recuperate and convalesce at the hotel.

‘Lady Thatcher doesn’t like a fuss being made of her but she is being pampered by all the staff. She went there straight from the hospital and no decision has been taken on how long she will stay there for.’

Lady Thatcher, who was admitted to hospital five days before Christmas, underwent ‘minimally invasive’ surgery.

She had been due to spend Christmas Day with her niece, Jane Mayes, who lives in north-east London. Mrs Mayes is the only daughter of her older sister, Muriel, who died aged 83 in 2004.

The previous year she had Christmas lunch with Mrs Mayes and her family because Lady Thatcher’s children, Sir Mark and Carol, were both abroad.

A small group of friends will take it in turns to visit Lady Thatcher at the hotel. They include Tory MP Conor Burns, former Scottish Secretary Lord Forsyth, Lord Powell, who was her foreign policy adviser at Downing Street, Sir Bernard Ingham who was her press secretary, and Dame Sue Tinson, who was a senior editor at ITN.

Cynthia Crawford, nicknamed Crawfie, who was Lady Thatcher’s personal assistant in the Downing Street years, will also visit.

Another of her regular visitors is Alison Wakeham, whose husband John, the former Cabinet minister, was badly injured in the IRA bomb which killed his first wife Roberta at the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984.

Luxury: Staff at The Ritz are 'pampering' Lady Thatcher

Sir Bernard Ingham said: ‘I find her better now than I have seen her in the last few years.

‘She always takes a lively interest in our conversation. She always wants to join in. Sometimes she starts to speak and then the thought deserts her. But she can be very animated. She is one of the greats.’

Lord Parkinson, who was chairman of the Tory Party, also makes a point of keeping in touch.

Shortly before Christmas, Lady Thatcher, accompanied by her carer Kate, had Sunday afternoon tea with Lord Parkinson and his wife Ann at their Hertfordshire home.

Lord Parkinson said: ‘Margaret looked wonderful and was in sparkling form. We had a lovely afternoon together.’
