A soldier and a woman were stabbed to death in two separate attacks on Israelis by Palestinian extremists.

The first incident saw a Palestinian man stab an Israeli soldier at a train station in Tel Aviv, who later died in hospital.

The attacks are said to be in response to tensions over a holy site in the city of Jerusalem, which sits on the border of Israel and the West Bank.

'During its 66 years of life so far, the fake Zionist regime has tried to realize its goals by means of infanticide, homicide, violence and iron fist,' The Ayatollah writes.

There was no immediate Palestinian comment after the
attacks in Tel Aviv and the West Bank.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressed the Tel Aviv assault in The Knesset.

He said: 'Terror ... is being directed at
all parts of the country for a simple reason: the terrorists,
the inciters, want to drive us from everywhere.'

'As far as they are concerned, we should not be in
Jerusalem, Tel Aviv or anywhere. I can promise you one thing -
they will not succeed. We will continue to fight terror ... and
we will defeat it together,' he said.
