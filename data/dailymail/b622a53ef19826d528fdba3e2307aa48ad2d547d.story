She once claimed her life contained too much too drama leaving her with little time to hit the gym.

But looking at her new slimline face and chiselled cheekbones, it appears the contentment of motherhood may have encouraged Adele Adkins to re-assess her priorities.

The award-winning star unveiled her taut jawline – a sharp contrast to the one she sported this time last year – as she enjoyed a rare night out without her son Angelo who will be celebrating his second birthday later this month (October 19).

Adele, pictured leaving Hackney Empire theatre in London on Wednesday night, looks significantly slimmer in the face in comparison with a photo taken at the Grammy awards in 2009

The 26-year-old Rolling In The Deep star was at Hackney Empire in London on Wednesday watching a performance by FKA Twigs and emerged having wrapped herself in a warm oversized black coat and bright Burberry scarf.

According to sources Adele is reported to now work out with a personal trainer, enjoys pilates and has given up smoking.

Her lifestyle now is a far cry from the one she enjoyed a few years ago when she said: 'My life is full of drama and I won’t have time to worry about something as petty as what I look like. I don’t like going to the gym.

‘I like eating fine foods and drinking nice wine.’

The singer, pictured performing at 2013's Oscars ceremony, is reportedly earning up to £80,000 a day despite having not released an album for four years

Last week it emerged Adele, who won an Oscar for James Bond theme tune Skyfall, is raking in up to £80,000 a day, despite having not released an album for the last four years.

Her two companies are reported to have earned £54 million in the 22 months up to December 31, 2013, mainly due to the huge success of her album, 21.

The Grammy award-winning star is understood to have been working on new material which could be released before the end of the year but following the birth of Angelo appears to have made a decision to take time out from the music industry and enjoy family life with her partner Simon Konecki.
