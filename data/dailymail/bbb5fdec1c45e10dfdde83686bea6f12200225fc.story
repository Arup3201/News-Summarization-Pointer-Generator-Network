A £100,000 hoard of vintage clothing has been discovered in dusty old house after the death of a real-life Miss Havisham.

Vervia Todd developed a secret obsession with fine clothing after the death of her fiance during the Second World War, travelling abroad each year to develope her collection, but keeping her amazing wardorbe before the discovery after her death last year.

Vervia, who was 92 when she died last November, never remarried after the tragic loss of her husband in her early twenties, and instead took the annual holidays on her own until the very last years of her life.

Each year she would buy a new suitcase
 and fill it with the finest specially-made clothing, only to stash it 
away unpacked upon her return.

Vervia Todd, pictured right on her retirement day, and left at about age 10, died last year leaving a vast collection of vintage couture

Many of the clothes remained hidden for over half a century, with one designer dress even being found up the chimney.

Vervia
 closed off rooms full of clothes in her three-story townhouse in 
Houghton Le-Spring, County Durham, hoarding her vast collection of 
couture and designer pieces over a period of seventy years.

The
 house gradually fell into disarray and the dusty old rooms remained 
unchanged for decades, stuck in an eerie time capsule reminiscent of 
Miss Havisham’s decaying mansion in the Charles Dickens novel Great 
Expectations.

Part of the incredible 'once in a lifetime' collection of vintage clothing from the 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s that has been uncovered in Houghton Le-Spring, County Durham which will go on sale in a special ticket only event on the 7th December

The vast collection, which no one realised existed, has taken 13 months to sort an organise

bedrooms, the faded floral wallpaper is hung upside down, whilst a 
once-opulent stand-alone bath dominates the archaic bathroom.

Vervia had remained 
tight-lipped about her phenomenal style stash, with friends and 
relatives only discovering the stunning collection when they came to 
empty her home after her death.

Now,
 the mesmerising collection of vintage dresses, hats and shoes has been 
uncovered, and is set to sell for the staggering six figure sum.

Vervia’s
 best friend Sheila Ellis, 65, and cousin Ann, have spent over a year 
uncovering endless trunks in the house where Vervia lived since the age 
of one.

But now the pair, 
who are the executors of Vervia’s will, are hoping that the clothes will
 be given a new lease of life by their new owners.

Vervia’s fiance tragically died whilst fighting in Arnhem in the Netherlands.

She never married and spent her life alone in the house after the death of her father, Sam Todd, a dental surgeon.

She said it just wasn’t meant to be,' said Sheila, a friend of Vervia’s for 30 years.

'She was a glamorous lady when she was younger. She had a very good figure, very trim.

'Off she’d go on holiday, often to Sorrento in Italy, and she’d come back three weeks later and leave the suitcase. We found all of those cases still packed.

'It was absolutely incredible but typical of her, she was one of a kind.”

Paula Donaldson, owner of vintage shop, Dregs of Society, in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, has been helping to organise the clothing for the upcoming sale.

Paula has been dealing in vintage clothing for around ten years and has never come across such a colossal collection.

She said: 'Nobody knew that she had these.

'She just loved to shop. Even when she was in her 80s, every Thursday or Friday she would go on the bus to Newcastle.

'Even when she was blind she would have her lunch at Fenwicks and go shopping.

'She shopped until she dropped really.

'[Her friend] Sheila knew that she kept things but I don’t think she realised the extent until they went up to the attic.'

The Victorian wedding dress of 
Vervia’s mother, Amy, was discovered in the house as well as Vervia’s 
grandmother’s Edwardian wedding gown, and it is planned that these 
dresses will go on display, possibly at Beamish Museum.

Sheila even found one dress stuffed up the chimney, and had thrown it in the rubbish before realising what it was.

'I pulled it from the chimney and to start off with I thought it was a rag, it was absolutely covered in soot,' said Sheila.

'I picked it up and put it in the 
rubbish pile and saw something glint and when I looked closer I realised
 it was a Marshall and Snelgrove dress.

'I hoovered all of the soot off it and rubbed it down with tepid water.

'I just thought nothing ventured nothing gained.'

And
 then Sheila and Ann donned forensic-style overalls before rolling up 
their sleeves for what would turn out to be a laborious 13 months of 
uncovering, restoring and repairing the many garments.

Whole rooms in the large townhouse had been closed off for decades at the time of Vervia's death

The house gradually fell into disarray and the dusty old rooms remained unchanged for decades, stuck in an eerie time capsule

But despite her hard-work, the sale will be bitter-sweet for Sheila.

She
 said: 'I will be delighted to think they’re gone to good homes but I’ll
 be sad to see them go because it’s taken over a year to get to this 
stage.'

The collection will 
be sold at an event at Vervia’s house in Houghton le Spring, County 
Durham, on 7 December. North News, Richmond House, Old Brewery Court, 
156 Sandyford Road, Newcastle.

Havisham's decaying mansion in the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations
