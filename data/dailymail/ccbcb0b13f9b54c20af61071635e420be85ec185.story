The latest lover of a notorious father-of-40 has revealed how the pair can't keep their hands off each other - and she's the only woman he now needs for sex.

Diane Morris, 46, is engaged to Mike Holpin, 56, who has shamelessly boasted of having children with 20 different women.

Ms Morris has brushed off claims that her partner uses dating site Plenty of Fish to meet more women for casual sex, claiming the two are 'crazy about each other' and that she trusts him 'completely'.

Ms Morris also said the two are 'crazy for each other' and it doesn't bother her that he's been married three times before

She said: 'Mike and I have a great sex life. It used to be once a day when we got together but now we are at it like every other day.

'Things are fantastic between us in that department. I trust Mike completely and I know his womanising days are over.

'So what if he's been married three times before but I know this time it is forever. We are crazy for each other.'

Mr Hopin, a former alcoholic of Ebbw Vale, South Wales, was strongly criticised after admitting he didn't even know the name of some of his 40 children.

And Ms Morris said there would not be any more children for the couple.

She said: 'Mike would love to have more kids but unfortunately I can't due to medical reasons.'

Ms Morris has a 28-year-old son from a previous relationship and met Mr Holpin through Plenty Of fish in 2012 - and he's still on the site.

She says: 'His profile on Plenty of Fish might be active but I know Mike wouldn't dream of cheating on me.

'I had been single for years and I was instantly attracted to Mike. He had lovely blue eyes and he was so charming and witty.'

She added it 'blew her away' when he revealed how many children he had fathered, but she 'appreciated his honesty'.

She met the former fairground worker - whose favourite chat-up line is 'fancy a rump?' - a few weeks after meeting online.

'We had a cup of tea and a chat back at his place and he showed me pictures of his kids. He was open about his womanising past but he didn't tell me straightaway that he had around 40 kids.

'I have to admit I was stunned when he first told me but by then I was falling for him.'

They pair are now inseparable and spend their days watching horror films and going for long walks.

After a year the couple moved in together and got engaged. Now the loved-up pair can't wait to tie the knot - the fourth time for Mr Holpin.

Ms Morris said: 'I was overjoyed when he proposed but we haven't set a date yet. We're saving £50 a month and it will a low key affair at a registry office. Of course we will invite all the kids but it's up to them if they want to come.'

He has been accused of playing computer games for up to 20 hours a day but Ms Morris insists he is a model fiance.

She said: 'Mike is on his computer a lot but he always helps me around the house. He mops the floors and chops the vegetables for dinner.'

Mr Holpin has been receiving benefits for 13 years and admits his £195 a week handouts on his 20-a-day smoking habit, as well as owning games consoles and widescreen TV's.

Ms Morris hasn't worked since her 20's due to suffering from bipolar disorder.

'Mike is an amazing dad and is always there for the kids. He is always around if they need to talk - that's much more important than material goods.'

She added she can't wait to be the fourth Mrs Holpin, and said: 'People might think I am mad but I really don't care. Mike is a new man and I know we are going to be together forever.'
