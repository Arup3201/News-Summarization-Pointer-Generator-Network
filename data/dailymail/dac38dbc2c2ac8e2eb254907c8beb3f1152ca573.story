Environment Secretary Owen Paterson today refused to back David Cameron's claim that the devastating storms which have battered Britain are linked to climate change.

The Tory minister, who is widely viewed as a climate change sceptic, seemed unable to bring himself to endorse the Prime Minister's view that global warming was to blame for the 60mph winds, heavy rain and floods which have swept across most of the country.

It came as the Met Office insisted it was too early to say what was the cause of the terrible weather, amid warnings that Britain must be braced for sub-zero temperatures and snow this weekend.

The Environment Agency has issued more than 300 flood warnings or alerts for England and Wales, with the majority in the Midlands and South.

Wales and South-West England are to endure more rain today and tomorrow, which will return again on Sunday - with a high chance of snow in the North.

Rising rivers include the Hampshire Avon through Wiltshire, Hampshire and Dorset, the Parrett in Somerset and the Severn through the Midlands.

Yesterday Mr Cameron told MPs: 'We are seeing more abnormal weather events.

‘Colleagues across the House can argue about whether that is linked to climate change or not. I very much suspect that it is.'

Today Labour MP Phil Wilson asked Mr Paterson if he agreed with the PM's view that the recent spell of severe weather was man made, prompting a roar of laughter on the opposition benches.

Mr Paterson side-stepped the question, replying: 'What the Prime Minister said is we should look at the practical measures we're taking, and I entirely endorse his questions.'

Meanwhile, the Met Office insisted it is too early to say whether climate change is behind the storms that have wreaked havoc across Britain.

Meteorologists said that no scientific research had been carried out into the cause of the heavy rain and floods that has blighted much of the country over Christmas and the New Year.

Dan Williams, a Met Office spokesman, said: 'No attribution study has been done, so you can't make a definitive statement about how more or less likely the recent flooding has become because of climate change.'

Mr Williams said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world leader on research into climate change - had produced a report last year linking some types of 'extreme weather' with man-made climate change.

'So if you are talking about extreme weather globally there has been some observed increase in some types of extreme weather and there is some evidence, depending on which types of extreme weather you are talking about, of a link between man-made climate change and some types of extreme weather,' he said.

Mr Williams said that this research was supported by attribution studies which looked at specific weather-related events, such as Hurricane Sandy, which devastated the Caribbean and North America, or a drought in East Africa.

'They can see how that event is more or less likely because of human influence,' he said.

'What those attribution studies have shown is that some events have become more likely and there are some events where there is no evidence of any human influence at all - it's a mixed bag really.

'You can't say definitively that an event is caused by climate change and climate change only because we have always had extreme weather.

'But the chances of extreme weather occurring may have altered because of climate change.

'So it would be consistent with the picture we have seen of increasing rainfall in the UK over the past few decades.'

Communities along the Thames throughout Surrey, Berkshire and Oxfordshire have also been warned they are at risk of flooding in the coming days.

Flooding continues on parts of the Somerset Levels, and there remains a risk of flooding from groundwater in Dorset, Wiltshire and West Sussex.

And this weekend conditions could worsen when temperatures plummet and snow arrives.

Laura Caldwell of MeteoGroup said: ‘There will be rain across a lot of England and Wales today and also showers in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

'It will all begin to clear throughout tomorrow before dry and sunny weather arrives at the weekend.

‘With that though we will have colder temperatures, dropping to below freezing on Saturday evening.

'(We will also have) snow across the hills in north England and reaching the ground in Scotland. But come Sunday, the rain will return in the south.’
