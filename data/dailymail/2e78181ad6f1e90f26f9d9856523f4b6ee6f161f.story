She might want to start paying closer attention.

An incredible video has shown the moment a distracted female humpback failed to spot a group of whale watchers aboard a small boat off Maui in Hawaii - so barreled right through them.

On the footage, which was taken by passenger Jennifer Nap earlier this month, the group gasps when they first spot the female humpback with her calf - unaware that they'll soon be getting a much closer view.

Suddenly, she turns towards their boat and, slapping her large pectoral fin, heads their way.  

Spotted: A group of whale watchers off Maui in Hawaii spotted this mother humpback whale with her calf during a trip - and gasped in joy... but she was about to get much, much closer

On her way: The whale, followed by her calf, suddenly turned towards the boat and headed their way

'It's gonna ram us,' one passenger shouts, while others scream in shock.

'This is so awesome!' says another as the whale glides beneath their 25-foot inflatable boat.

Although the knock from the whale wasn't a hard strike, it was enough to 'toss our boat a good five feet when she hit,' Jennifer Nap told GrindTV.

'As soon as she was done pushing us aside she dove under, then popped right back up on the other side with her calf,' she said.

Nap, who shared the video to YouTube, explained she was taking the Ultimate Whale Watch trip with her husband, Ryan, when they spotted the whales from afar.

The crew had switched off the engines - and experts said this could be one of the reasons the mom whale didn't notice the boat.

Water sight! With no plan of stopping - and likely distracted by her calf and a bothersome male nearby - the whale heads towards the boat as the spectators scream in joy and shock

Collision: The whale can be seen swimming beneath the boat, which is knocked and moved about five feet

Just passing through: After the collision, the whale and the calf continued as if nothing had happened

But she was also likely keeping her eye on a bothersome male whale lurking nearby, said Lee James, CEO for Ultimate Whale Watch.

'It is most likely that this mom was distracted with her calf and keeping another eye on a escort that was being a little irritating for the female, as escorts can be,' James told GrindTV.

Afterwards, she carried on slapping her fin 'like nothing happened', he said.

It is unlikely that she was trying to warn the passengers to keep away from her calf because a whale is more likely to slap its tail fin - rather than the pectoral fin - and make noises to signal its anger.

Each year, humpback whales migrate from cool waters near Alaska to Hawaii, where they breed, and can be seen regularly between November and May, according to the Pacific Whale Foundation.
