A New Zealander who declared he was on jihad, burned his passport and posted the charred remains on Facebook when he ran away to Syria reportedly wants to come home.

Mark John Taylor wants a new passport after he previously posted his destroyed document online with the caption 'one-way trip'.

However, the New Zealand government have allegedly not replied to his requests for a new passport.

In an interview with Aotearoa Independent Media Centre, the bearded Kiwi said he plans to leave Syria around late October.

'I only went there for adventure Jihad, but along the way I realised Syria is in a very dire need of humanity aid and support,' he said, refuting his alleged terrorist activities.

Mark John Taylor reportedly wants another New Zealand passport after he burned his old one when fleeing to Syria to be a jihad

Taylor, who is in his early 40s, now goes by the name of Mohammad Daniel and is also known as Abu Abdul-Rahman.

In July this year he told the New Zealand Herald on Sunday that he would remain in Syria until he achieved 'martyrdom'.

He said he became a jihad because he was 'refused by the NZ Army for re-enlistment'. 

In a 15 second video posted on YouTube in June, viewed by Daily Mail Australia, a man who is named as Taylor says: 'I am the New Zealander known as Mark John Taylor, my current location is in Syria and my commitment is for jihad, for Allah and his messenger.'   

In September 2011, he appeared on TV3's 60 Minutes and claimed his life had been ruined after he previously travelled to Pakistan in 2009 and tried to enter the al-Qaeda stronghold of Wana.

Taylor appeared on 60 Minutes in 2011 after he was named as person of security interest 

He said he had only travelled to the Middle Eastern country to 'find a wife'.

He was exposed when he was named amongst a list of 23 Australian-based people of security interest in a secret diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks.

'I didn't have a death wish I was just looking for a lady for marriage. It was my mistake. People might call me stupid and dumb for making that mistake but that's my problem,' he told 60 Minutes.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said in 2011 that Taylor was 'someone that has quite a number of restrictions on him for very good reasons'.

Taylor said he doesn't want to come back to New Zealand but he could go to Australia and Indonesia where he previously lived 

But Taylor was released without charge in Pakistan and moved to Australia, back to New Zealand, and then Indonesia where he worked as English teacher before travelling to Syria via Turkey in July this year - despite his travel restrictions.

In June he reportedly told The Australian that he hasn't joined any groups 'except for al-Qaeda'.

The paper reports that on Sunday, he commented on Facebook that New Zealand authorities 'don’t seem concern (sic) I’m in Syria'.

Despite his apparent desire to have a New Zealand passport again, Taylor reportedly told the Aotearoa Independent Media Centre that he doesn't actually want to return to New Zealand.
