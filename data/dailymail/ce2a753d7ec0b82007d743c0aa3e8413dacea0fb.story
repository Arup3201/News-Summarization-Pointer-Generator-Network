The Pope discussed the ‘pressures of office’ during private meetings with  Dr Rowan Williams last year and gave the impression that he might step down, the former Archbishop of Canterbury has revealed.

Many of Benedict XVI’s aides described last week’s announcement that he would retire later this month as a ‘bolt from the blue’, but Dr Williams said it did not come as a total surprise to him.

During their conversations, the 85-year-old pontiff acknowledged his ‘frailty’, Dr Williams said. He added that he thought then the Pope ‘was beginning to ask, “Is it possible to carry on with a good conscience?” ’

Interviewed by Vatican Radio, the former Archbishop said he was sure the Pope had been wrestling with the dilemma of whether to resign or ‘soldier on to the end’ like his predecessor Pope John Paul II, who publicly battled with illness until his death in 2005.

The disclosure is fresh evidence that the Pope had been considering his future for many months as he struggled with the so-called Vatileaks scandal – the leaking by his butler of stolen documents that exposed corruption in the Vatican.

Insiders believe a secret report into the affair – that made clear the extent of feuding among cardinals – could have been the clinching factor in convincing the Pope that he no longer had the energy to impose his will.

Private meetings between Dr Williams and the Pope, who built up a firm rapport as they battled various crises in their respective churches, took place in Rome in March and October last year.

Dr Williams said he and the Pope had discussed his own decision to step down as Archbishop eight years earlier than he was required to, adding that ‘we shared some reflections on the pressures of office and, yes, we spoke about the promise to do a bit more thinking  and a bit more praying’.

One priest involved in  Dr Williams’s visits added: ‘There was certainly an air of weariness from the Pope.’

Senior Church sources have revealed that the Pope’s ‘seismic’ decision to become the first pontiff for nearly 600 years to resign has angered key Vatican figures, who fear it will ultimately undermine the papacy.

One cardinal said there  was ‘no doubt’ that some within the Vatican were  upset by the decision.

He added while many senior clergy supported Benedict’s right to leave office, others feared the post would be diminished and his successors would be plagued by groups demanding  their resignations.
