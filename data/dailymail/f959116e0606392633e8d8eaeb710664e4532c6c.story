Fred Goodwin and other former senior officers at the Royal Bank of Scotland are facing a £2.4billion legal claim from furious investors.

The former RBS chief executive is just one of 17 former directors due to receive claims letters today from the RBoS Shareholders Action Group.

They are accused of glossing over the 
dire financial health of the company when it went cap in hand to 
shareholders to raise money in April 2008.

Pressure: Former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin and ex-chairman Tom McKillop (right) are among bosses who will receive claim letters from shareholders demanding compensation for 'misrepresenting information'

The bank was later bailed out with £45billion of taxpayers’ money, just months after the £12billion rights issue.

Investors suffered huge losses, with the
bank’s share price slumping from a high of 607p in March 2007 to just 
25.37p yesterday. 

The action is being taken by the RBoS 
Shareholders Action Group, which sent a letter to RBS and a small group 
of former directors yesterday.

The group represents almost 7,500 private
shareholders and powerful institutional investors including Deutsche 
Bank.

Also being sued: Former group finance director Guy Whittaker and ex-head
of investment banking Johnny Cameron (right) are also being blamed for 
an alleged cover-up that forced shareholders to pay out £12bn

It alleges that there was 'an 
incredible cover-up' at the bank, which maintained it was not short of 
cash and even allegedly concealed a loan from the U.S. government.

London lawyers Bird & Bird will 
today send letters to the bank, Mr Goodwin, former chairman Sir Tom 
McKillop, former head of investment banking Johnny Cameron and the 
former finance director Guy Whittaker, among others.

2012 did not get off to a great start for Fred Goodwin.

On January 31, he joined the ranks of
Robert Mugabe and  Nicolae Ceausescu by being stripped of his knighthood
- after the Forfeiture Committee decided his actions had brought the 
system 
into disrepute.

And last month, Mr Goodwin resigned as a
trustee of the Queen’s personal charity to avoid further embarrassment 
to the Royal Family.

The
shamed banker, who was once a regular visitor to Balmoral, quit the 
Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust just days after his honour was annulled.

Mr 
Goodwin, who led the Royal Bank of Scotland to the verge of collapse, 
became the public face of the banking disaster which plunged Britain 
into recession and cost taxpayers billions.

He quit his role as chairman of the Prince’s Trust in 2009 in the wake of public anger over the bailout of RBS.

But his role since 2004 as one of six
trustees of the Queen’s personal charity, which distributes money to 
good causes, did not emerge until last year.

A number of other professional bodies have considered stripping Mr Goodwin of fellowships they awarded him.

These include the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Investors allege RBS hid the truth 
about its desperate finances, including the fact that it had taken out a
loan from the U.S. Federal Reserve, when it asked for the cash.

They also claim that Mr Goodwin, who 
was stripped of his knighthood in January, had publicly denied the need 
for a rights issue, stating only two months earlier: 'There are no plans
for any inorganic capital raisings or anything of the sort.'

Shares in the bank were changing hands
at 200p at the time of the rights issue, but by October that year they 
had plummetted to just 65.5p.

The
following December RBS received its first £20billion government 
bailout, and it got a further injection of £25billion in taxpayers' 
money 12 months later.

The huge rescue bailouts and collapse in share price left shareholders significantly out of pocket.

Despite
concluding that RBS's near collapse was due to poor management, the 
Financial Services Authority did not take action against Mr Goodwin or 
any other of the bank's directors.

Nevertheless, the shamed bank boss, who quit on a bumper pension, was stripped of his knighthood.

Action group coordinator Mike Neill 
told The Sun: 'We are anxious to get Mr Goodwin and others into a 
witness box to ask them certain questions.

'There is tremendous anger and absolute hatred.

'They didn't give us information - it was an incredible cover-up.'

The
group is backed by 7,400 private shareholders and 80 institutional 
investors, including Collins Stewart, Deutsche Bank, SG Hambro, Credit 
Agricole, and HSBC Global Custody.

A spokesman for RBS told the Independent that the group has 'substantial and credible legal and factual defences' to the claims.

The bank will 'defend itself vigorously', the spokesman added.
