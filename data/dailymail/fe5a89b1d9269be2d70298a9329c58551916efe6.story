Odzhan, dubbed the Siberian Mowgli, said he is happy living in the wilderness and does not want to move to the city

A young man dubbed the 'Siberian Mowgli' after being raised in the Russian wilderness said he is happy and does not want to move back to the city.

He spoke to people living near the town of Belokurikha this week for the first time in 16 years.

He has lived with his parents Alexander and Elena in an isolated one-room hut and has missed all formal schooling.

But Odzhan says he wants to remain in the small house and does not want to live near other people.

He told The Siberian Times: 'We are living well. This is the reality we have that we live here, and it's quite a good reality.

'To
move closer towards the city? For that we need to have a more cultural 
society, and of course to change how the cities smell and the pollution.

'I am happy here.'

The
family have survived by occasionally selling mushrooms or his artist 
father's paintings to the few people they come in contact with.

His parents have taught him to read and write and he has even learned to speak English from a dictionary. Â 

Odzhan said the only thing he craves is to practice his language skills with a native speaker.

He
told the newspaper: 'Of course, I need to have practice - if only I 
could have a chance to communicate with somebody who speaks no words on 
Russia - at least for a month.'

The young man said he spends the rest of his time painting or reading other books.

His parents rejected conventional society in the early 90s following the collapse of the Soviet regime.

They said they only wanted their son to be a 'clever, kind and true man'.

Odzhan
was found by locals at the end of the summer. According to reports his 
parents left him alone in the hut in May and he eventually sought help 
in a nearby village.

The 
Russian media variously dubbed him 'forest boy' or the 'Siberian 
Mowgli,' after the main character in Rudyard Kipling's 'The Jungle 
Book.'

Roman Fomin, a local 
prosecutor, told AFP that a local woman had brought the young man to 
authorities out of fear that he may need help through the cold winter, 
but the man then had gone back to his hiding place in the forest.

Officials
from Mr Fomin's office, alarmed that he may have to spend winter alone 
in the wild, appealed in court to have his identification documents 
re-established so the man, who has not been named, can seek state support.

Mr Fomin said: 'I am not sure if he needs all this attention.

'He looked normal and healthy.

'He only spoke slowly, since he doesn't communicate as often as most people.'

The family have shared the very basic, wooden hut, since the rejected society in the mid-90s

The Altai Mountains: The Siberian region's rolling foothills, grasslands, lakes, rivers, and mountains are alternately frozen and baked by long cold dry winters and hot, usually dry summers

Belokurikha
is a well-known resort area in Russia's picturesque Altai region in 
south Siberia, known for mineral springs, health spas, and skiing.

Its
rolling foothills, grasslands, lakes, rivers, and mountains are 
alternately frozen and baked by long cold dry winters and hot, usually 
dry summers.

The story has echoes of the 'Forest Boy' who two years ago duped German authorities into believing he was an English teenager called Ray who had been brought up in the woods of central Europe.

He said he had been living in a forest with his father called Ryan for five years but had buried him after his sudden death two weeks previously.

It eventually emerged that he was 21-year-old Dutchman Robin van Helsum who had concocted his elaborate tale in an effort to escape debts to his landlord and a pregnant ex-girlfriend.
