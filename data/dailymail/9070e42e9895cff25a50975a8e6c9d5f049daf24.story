Bookmakers have pledged to refund all bets placed on who would light the Olympic cauldron after some of Britain's greatest Olympians teamed up with young athletes for the honour.

No one could have predicted the surprise move and the only fair solution was to refund more than £50,000 of bets placed over the last seven years, William Hill said.

Other bookmakers, including Sky Bet, also voided all bets, saying it was 'impossible to back the correct flame lighter'.

Surprise: In an unexpected move a group of seven young athletes lit the Olympic Cauldron during the London Olympic Games 2012 Opening Ceremony

Honour: The seven stars of the future were nominated to carry out the honour by a host of former Olympic greats

Handover: Sir Steve Redgrave was given the honour of carrying the torch into the stadium where he then handed it over to the up and coming athletes

The cauldron lighter had been a source of controversy in the lead up to last night's opening ceremony with Olympic legends Sir Steve Redgrave, Daley Thompson and Roger Bannister all hotly tipped to be given the honour.

It even led to a war of words between former decathlete Thompson and rower Redgrave as they seemingly went head to head to light the cauldron, as they both questioned the other's credentials to be the one to light the 
fire to launch London 2012.

Redgrave did run into the stadium holding the Torch last night but he was greeted by seven young athletes, each nominated by himself and British Olympic heroes Lynn Davies, Duncan Goodhew, Dame Kelly Holmes, Dame Mary Peters, Shirley Robertson and Daley Thompson.

It was the young athletes who each lit one of the copper petals which had been brought into the stadium with the teams and then rose to form the cauldron.

The decision has received some criticism across the globe however, as John Cherwa from the LA Times wrote: 'Hated the flame lighting. Just make a decision and pick someone.'

Australian journalist Karen Tighe, the Perth-based ABC Sports presenter, told BBC Radio 5Live: 'I really loved the inspiration of a new generation, but it kind of felt a bit of an anti-climax at that point.'

The teenagers, who have all shown promise
in their disciplines, ran around the track together after being passed 
the flame.

Callum 
Airlie, 17, was nominated by gold medal-winning sailor Shirley 
Robertson. He has been sailing since the age of four, and is a two-time 
Optimist UK national champion who aims to be entered into the 2013 ISAF 
(International Sailing Association & Federation) Open.

Jordan 
Duckitt, 18, was chairman of the London 2012 Young Ambassador Steering 
Group for two years, and was nominated by Duncan Goodhew.

'not in the same class' as his friend Sebastian Coe, but neither ended up lighting the cauldron after weeks of debate

Athletics talent Desiree Henry was put forward by Daley Thomson after the
16-year-old was the youngest member of the Great Britain youth team to 
gain a world 200m title at the IAAF World Youth Championships in 2011.

Runner
Katie Kirk, 18, who was selected to run in the 400m at the Commonwealth
Games in Delhi, India, was nominated by Dame Mary Peters, who won gold 
in the women`s Pentathlon at the 1972 Munich games, while Sir Steve 
nominated young rower Cameron MacRitchie, 19.

The
teenager finished fifth with his partner James Edwards in the men`s 
pair at the 2012 GB rowing team under 23 trials in April.

Aidan Reynolds, 18, was put forward by Lynn Davies, who captained Team GB at Moscow 1980 and Los Angeles 1984 and Adelle Tracey was nominated by double gold medalist Dame Kelly Holmes.

Tipped: Sir Roger Bannister had been widely tipped to lit the cauldron

Aidan
gave up a promising basketball career to focus on the javelin, winning 
three medals at national level at the English Schools, UK School Games 
and English Championships while Adelle won 800m silver for Great Britain in the European Youth Olympic Festival in Finland.

Despite the surprise cauldron lighting Sir Steve 
Redgrave, said today that he was "very emotional" when he carried the 
Torch into the Olympic Stadium.

The five-times Olympic rowing champion told BBC 
Breakfast: 'It was very special. I must admit I probably knew about 10 
days before. I'm looking forward now to not being asked questions such 
as 'Are you lighting the torch, or the cauldron?'

'I suppose the questions now will be 'Are you putting out the cauldron?' - I've not had that phone call yet.'

He said that when he entered the stadium there was an 'absolutely amazing atmosphere'.

He
added: 'There was a line-up of construction workers on the site, suited
and booted, it was very emotional for them and for me.'

Sir Steve, 
who was at Eton Dorney today, where the rowing will take place, revealed
that he saw very little of the opening ceremony.

'I saw the first 
five minutes of the actual opening, then I was taken away for the 
filming, I got into my pyjama suit, I've still got the shoes on now.

Speaking after the decision to refund all bets Graham Sharpe, of William Hill, said: 'What happened, no-one could have predicted. It was not put to us, nobody quoted it.

'The only fair thing to do was to refund all the bets from over the last seven years.'

He added: 'Sir Steve Redgrave was an early favourite.

'It's like a horse coming along the final leg, then along comes another horse and the jockey jumps off and gets on the other one.

'We've got to hold our hands up.

'Everyone has had a lot of fun, but there was no declared winner.

'Let's move on and start backing the next one.'

It had been a 'lively market' with lots of relatively small £5, £10 and £20 bets, he added, with the biggest stake placed being £100.

More than £50,000 was placed at William Hill on athletes including Sir Steve and Sir Roger Bannister, the first man to break the four-minute mile.
