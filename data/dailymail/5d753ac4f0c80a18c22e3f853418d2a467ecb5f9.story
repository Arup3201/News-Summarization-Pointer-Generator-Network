On Thursday meanwhile she told the judge; 'I am the Michelangelo of buttocks injections ... A lot of people came to me. My work spoke for itself.'

The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that Windslowe flirted with Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega and then 'cooed' at her attorney, David S. Rudenstein; 'I'm very happy with you, Mr. Rudenstein. You made my day a delight.'

Rudenstein replied; 'Well, that's good.' 

The hearing was held to discuss the defense's motion to have the trial aborted as one of the prosecution's key witnesses has stated she will not travel from London to Philadelphia to testify. 

Theresa Gyamfi was present on February 11, 2011, when Claudia Aderotimi allegedly received a silicone injection in her buttocks from Windslowe.

Windslowe is also charged with practicing medicine without a license and aggravated assault for an injection she gave another exotic dancer

Police say that Windslowe fled the hotel room after Aderotimi started having trouble breathing during 'a touch-up,' which was meant as a way to celebrate her birthday in 2011.

A coroner has testified that the industrial-grade silicone spread to her lungs and brain and caused a pulmonary embolism.

The judge ruled that Gyamfi's testimony from a 2012 preliminary hearing could be read to the jury. 

Windslowe is also charged with practicing medicine without a license and aggravated assault for an injection she gave exotic dancer Shurkia King at another 'pumping party.'

King was admitted to the hospital with difficulty breathing and vomiting blood after receiving an injection. 

Though she had no medical training, she would charge $1,000 to $1,800 per injection.
