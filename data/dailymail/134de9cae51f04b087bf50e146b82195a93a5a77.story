Thavisha Peiris, 25, was stabbed to death as he was making the last stop of his final shift as a delivery boy before quitting to work as an IT consultant

A teenager has admitted murdering a Domino's Pizza delivery driver who was just about to quit to work in his dream job as an IT consultant.

Kasim Ahmed, 18, pleaded guilty to murdering Thavisha Peiris, 25, along with two counts of robbery at Sheffield Crown Court today.

Co-defendant Shamraze Khan, 26, also admitted two counts of robbery but denies murder and will stand trail at the same court starting tomorrow.

On the night he died, Mr Peiris had been delivering his last pizza on his final shift as a Domino’s driver in Sheffield, a part-time job that had helped fund his studies.

Colleagues, who went to look for Mr Peiris when he failed to deliver his order, found his body slumped in his silver Toyota Yaris at around 10.30pm.

Mr Peiris came to the UK to finish an IT degree and graduated from Sheffield Hallam University in 2011 and had secured a job as an IT consultant in the city just before he was killed.

His colleagues and police said he had been feeling unwell during his last shift and was going to go home early but agreed to deliver one last order.

Mr Peiris came from a hard-working family. His father, who worked for a petrochemical plant before his retirement and his mother, a housewife, saved hard for their children’s education and sent him to a well-regarded school in the Sri Lankan capital.

Peiris (far right, pictured with his family) studied IT in Sri Lanka before moving to the UK in 2011 to do a 'top-up' course after winning a place at Sheffield Hallam University

After studying IT, Mr Peiris moved to Britain in 2011 to do a ‘top-up’ course required to bring his qualifications up to degree level.

He won a place at Sheffield Hallam University, graduating that year with a degree in information technology.

Shortly before his death, he had landed a job as an IT consultant and had been ‘excited’ about starting a career.

On the evening he died, he had told his bosses that he was feeling ill and asked to finish work early.

However, he agreed to deliver one last pizza before going home and set off at 9.50pm. When he failed to deliver the order, his colleagues became concerned and set off to find him.

Peiris used the part-time delivery job to fund his degree studies. On the night he died he complained about feeling ill and was due to go home early, but agreed to stay and do extra work

Peiris was found slumped in his silver Toyota Yaris by colleagues after failing to make a delivery in October last year

They spotted the company’s Toyota Yaris parked in a residents’ bay near the delivery address at 10.30pm, with Mr Peiris ‘slumped in his vehicle’.

In a previous statement paying tribute to their son, father Sarath Mahinda Peiris and mother Vajira Peiris Narangoda said: 'We sent our son to the UK to study so he can have a better life. Now we are left with only a broken heart.

'We were devastated and shocked to hear of our son's tragic end and we are still unable to comprehend that he is actually gone.

'Thavisha was one of the most caring and loving sons a parent could have. He was full of life and always had a smile on his face. Anyone who met him immediately liked him.'
