President Barack Obama has admitted that giving the green light to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden was 'a flip of the coin' decision.

The president revealed he was only 50 per cent confident that the man spotted by the C.I.A. living in an Abbottabad compound was the world's most wanted terrorist, according to a new book that weaves together accounts from Obama and top decision-makers on the events leading up to the daring operation and it's aftermath.

'This is 50–50,' Obama said, silencing the small group of senior officials gathered in the situation room. 'This is a flip of the coin. You guys, I can't base this decision on the notion that we have any greater certainty than that.'

Published in part in the latest Vanity Fair, Mark Bowden's eye-opening book reveals how the head of the C.I.A.'s bin Laden team was only 60 per cent sure the terrorist was living in the Pakistan property.

Michael Morell said the evidence to suggest that Saddam Hussein was hoarding weapons of mass destruction, which later turned out not to be the case, was 'much stronger' than the intelligence on bin Laden's whereabouts.

Morell had been personally involved in the flawed analysis of Saddam's weapons capability.

'I'm telling you, the case for W.M.D. wasn't just stronger — it was much stronger,' he said.

But Obama decided to press ahead.

'One of the things you learn as president is you're always dealing with probabilities,' he told Mr Bowden.

'No issue comes to my desk that is 
perfectly solvable. No issue comes to my desk where there’s 100 per cent
confidence that this is the right thing to do.

'Because if people were 
absolutely certain then it would have been decided by someone else.

'In this situation, what you started getting was probabilities that disguised uncertainty as opposed to actually providing you with more useful information.'

The only major dissenter to the plan was Joe Biden, the book says.

'Mr President, my suggestion is: don't go,' the vice president said, believing that a failed attack would scupper any chance of a second term.

'We have to do two more things to see if he's there.'

Despite coming to terms with the 
50/50 per cent probability that the so-called 'Pacer' who teams had been
monitoring as he walked around the compound's grounds, was bin Laden, 
Obama said he couldn't help churning the details over in his mind the 
night before the raid.

'It was a matter of taking one last 
breath and just making sure, asking is there something that I haven’t 
thought of?' Obama said.

'Is there something that we need to do?... At that point my estimation was that we weren't going to be able to do it better a month or two months or three months from now.

'We weren’t going to have better certainty about whether bin Laden was there, and so it was just a matter of pulling the trigger.'

The book explains that a courier initially led the C.I.A. to the compound where they discovered three families living together in the large property, which was out of place for the area.

The identity of the third family, however, was a mystery.

The most important clue was the figure who came to be known as The Pacer, a man in traditional Pakistani attire and prayer cap who regularly took walks around the vegetable garden. Agents took photos and video footage of the man as he paced the grounds.

They also counted the pieces of laundry that were hung out to dry to determine the size of the hidden family.

The number of wives and children corresponded with the number of family members they believed might be living with bin Laden.

The C.I.A. then got mission commander admiral Bill McRaven on board, and the elite group of Navy Seals did two separate practice runs on American soil before the nail-biting May 2011 raid, which ended the life of the al Qaeda leader.
