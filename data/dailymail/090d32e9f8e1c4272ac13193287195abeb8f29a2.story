Retired High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge said cohabiting couples should never be allowed legal rights over each other’s money and property

Cohabiting couples should never be allowed legal rights over each other’s money and property, one of Britain’s most senior family law experts said yesterday.

Giving them the same rights as married couples would be naive and send out the wrong message, said retired High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge.

His intervention comes amid fresh attempts – backed by many judges and lawyers – to push a law through Parliament setting out legal entitlements for those in live-in relationships.

He said any law designed to give special rights to just one section of the population would be a mistake. And he criticised politicians – including Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg – who support a new law for ‘giving the impression that marriage doesn’t matter’.

Sir Paul, who heads the Marriage Foundation think-tank, is the first senior judge to come out strongly against any cohabitation law.

He had once supported such a move, he said, as it would protect women left penniless after the breakdown of a long live-in relationship.

But yesterday he told the Daily Mail: ‘I have had a Damascene conversion. I used to be quite in favour of some form of legal protection.

‘But I have drawn away from a cohabitation law. It is a naive, lawyer-driven idea, and some leadership is needed.’

Sir Paul, who retired in April but still presides in the occasional family case, said that giving legal rights to cohabitees would be a signal of official approval of such relationships.

‘You have to look at the bigger picture,’ he said.

‘There are nearly two million children of these relationships and they are at a disadvantage because of that. I think that is fully established now. The Government should be unequivocal in its support for marriage. Half of all family litigation is a matter of family breakdown among the unmarried.

‘That means 20 per cent of the population but 50 per cent of family court workload. Can you imagine the effect on the courts if there is legislation to give rights to cohabitees?’ Sir Paul said the debate on changing the law had overshadowed arguments about the need to strengthen marriage and called for more attention to be paid to ‘the terrible problem of family breakdown and the divisions it is creating in society’.

Sir Paul’s intervention comes as much of the legal profession and many politicians have been trying to build support for a cohabitation law.The most senior family law judge, President of the Family Division Sir James Munby, said in October that the lack of legal protection for cohabitees ‘is an injustice which has been recognised as long as I have been in the law’

‘People think marriage is for the likes of them, it’s not for us. This is not helped by people like Nick Clegg and others who give the impression that marriage doesn’t matter and all relationships are the same.’

Sir Paul’s intervention comes as much of the legal profession and many politicians have been trying to build support for a cohabitation law.

The most senior family law judge, President of the Family Division Sir James Munby, said in October that the lack of legal protection for cohabitees ‘is an injustice which has been recognised as long as I have been in the law’.

He said: ‘Reform is desperately needed. Reform is inevitable. How many more women are to be condemned to injustice in the meantime?’

Liberal Democrat peer Lord Marks has tabled a Bill in the Lords that would give cohabiting partners rights after they had lived together for two years or after they have had children. That would see a cohabitee entitled to a share of the money, property and pension of their former partner in the event of a break-up.

Lawyers have been calling for such a law for of years.

However, critics point out that it would provide a new source of lucrative earnings for the legal profession.

David Cameron rejected the idea of a cohabitation law shortly after the Coalition took power in 2010.

There are nearly three million cohabiting couples in the country, with numbers rising.

However, such relationships typically last only a third as long as the average marriage.

And evidence also shows that children of cohabitees are less wealthy, less healthy and less likely to do well at school.

Critics blame the rise of cohabitation for the increasing number of children in one-parent families.

Putting laws around such relationships gives them 'official approval'
