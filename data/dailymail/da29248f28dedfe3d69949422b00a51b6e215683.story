USA fans need not worry that their team's must-watch match against Germany kicks off while they should be at work - after coach Jurgen Klinsmann gave them permission to take the day off.

The USA coach sent out an absence note on social media for supporters - with understanding bosses - to excuse them for the day, and reminded those willing not to forget to 'wear your jersey'.

The best excuse for staying at home, Klinsmann believes, is because the team 'will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round'.

The note, tweeted by the official @ussoccer account, reads: 'Please excuse (insert name here) from work on Thursday, June 26th.

'I understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace, but I can assure you that it is for an important cause.

'The #USMNT has a critical World Cup game vs. Germany and we will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round.

'By the way, you should act like a good leader and take the day off as well. Go USA!'

USA's progress to the last 16 will heavily depend on how the game between Ghana and Portugal pans out, should Klinsmann's side lose to Joachim Low's Germany.

It would take something special for Cristiano Ronaldo to be among those in the next round, as Portugal need to win and overturn a five-goal advantage that USA hold over them.

Preparation: USA can top the group but have to beat Germany to do so due to their superior goal difference

All but through: USA know a draw would be enough to see them through for definite
