The Mangalyaan spacecraft successfully entered orbit around Mars this morning, making India the first Asian nation to reach the red planet.

The Mars Orbiter Mission cost £45 million ($74 million), or about three-quarters the amount to make the Oscar-winning movie Gravity about astronauts stranded in space.

It arrived in orbit around the red planet after a tense 300-day marathon travelling more than 420 million miles (670 million km).

Just an hour after reaching the orbit, India's space agency, ISRO, received the first photographic data of the red planet’s terrain, which will be unveiled later this afternoon.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mom) crowned a 'near impossible' push to become the only country to complete the trip on its maiden attempt.

Both Russia and the US failed their first attempts to Mars, while the Chinese mission to Mars, dubbed Yinghuo-1 mission failed in 2011 and the Japanese mission to Mars ran out of fuel.

'History has been created today,' said Modi at the state-run Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) when it was announced the mission had been accomplished.

On average, it lies 141.6 million miles from the sun.

With a diameter of 4,222 miles, it’s around half the size of the Earth and has an average temperature of -85F (-65C).

Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours.

The atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – and  95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide.

It boasts the solar system’s biggest mountain – Olympus Mons, a dead volcano.

It measures 335 miles across and rises to a height of 88,000ft, which is almost three times higher than Everest.Mars has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons Deimos and Phobos.

Mars’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface.

Mars has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps.If they melted, it would cover the whole planet in water 11-metres deep, according to Nasa.

'We have dared to reach out into the unknown and haveachieved the near impossible,' said Modi, wearing a symbolic redwaistcoat at the space command centre in the southern city of Bangalore. 

Modi has said he wants to expand the country's
five-decade-old space programme.

With a spacecraft around Mars, India joins a small group of
nations - the United States, Russia and Europe - that have
successfully sent probes to orbit or land on Mars.

ISRO successfully ignited the main 440 Newton liquid engine
and eight small thrusters that fired for 24 minutes and trimmed
the speed of the craft to allow smooth orbit insertion under
Mars' shadow. A confirmation of orbit entry was received at
around 8 a.m. India time.

After completing the journey in more than 10 months, the Mangalyaan spacecraft ('Mars craft' in Hindi) will now study the red planet's surface and scan its atmosphere
for chemical methane.

It will be examining Mars for methane, a key chemical in life processes on Earth that could also come from geological processes. 

None of the instruments will send back enough data to answer these questions definitively, but experts say the data will help them better understand how planets form and what conditions might make life possible.

Scientists said it was helpful that Mangalyaan's data will reflect the same time period as data being collected by Nasa's newest Maven mission, allowing the two data sets to be compared for better understanding.

The U.S. has two more satellites circling the planet at the moment, as well as two rovers rolling across the rocky Martian surface.

The official Twitter account of Nasa's Curiosity Rover - which has been on the Martian surface since 2012, tweeted: 'Namaste, @MarsOrbiter! Congratulations to @ISRO and India’s first interplanetary mission upon achieving Mars orbit.

Mangalyaan’s Twitter account replied: 'Howdy @MarsCuriosity ? Keep in touch. I’ll be around.'

The technological triumph is fortuitously timed for Modi -
he will be able to flaunt the achievement on a trip to the
United States starting on Friday that includes an address to the
United Nations.

Nasa's Curiosity Rover Twitter account tweeted a congratulations message to ISRO's Mars Orbiter, to which it replied 'Keep in touch. I'll be around'

As India makes makes space history on Mars, Russia is hoping to do the same on the moon by 2030. 

The head of Roscomsos, Oleg Ostapenko, said plans were underway for a manned spacecraft to reach the moon by the end of the next decade.

The system will deliver cargo and cosmonauts to the moon, and someday also into the deep space, according to Ostapenko.

'Based on the results of lunar surface exploration by unmanned space probes, we will designate [the] most promising places for lunar expeditions and lunar bases,' Ostapenko said.

'The success of our space programme is a shining symbol of
what we are capable of as a nation. Our space programme has been
an example of achievement,' said the nationalist prime minister.

Modi also holds the additional charge as India's minister of
space, and in June endorsed the low-cost of the project, saying
it cost even less than the budget 'Gravity'. The Hollywood
blockbuster cost about $100 million to make.

India’s Mars, however, has faced some criticism by critics, who have said the country could not afford to indulge in such a mission when a third of the population have no access to electricity.

The country's space programme was launched in the early
1960s and India developed its own rocket technology after
Western powers imposed sanctions for a nuclear weapons test in
1974. 

Still, the country remains a small player in the global space industry that grew to £191 billion ($314 billion) in revenues and government budgets in 2013.

Experts say Mars mission success can help change that.

'ISRO will now hopefully attract a lot of business,' said Mayank Vahia, a scientist at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. 

With 30 Indian and 40 foreign satellite launches so far, its nearest cheap competition would be China, which is armed with bigger space launchers. 

ISRO signed an agreement with China National Space Administration on Friday to cooperate in research and development of various satellites.
