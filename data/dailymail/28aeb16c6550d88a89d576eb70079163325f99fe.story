Stranded in the wilderness after four days of walking and with a pair of hungry wolves following his every trudging step, a Russian hunter dropped face-first into the snow ready to die

But as the ravenous animals closed in on Spiridon Vinokurov, a rescue helicopter spotted his lifeless body in the snow and airlifted him to hospital.

The 48-year-old is now recovering having suffered severe frostbite during the ordeal in Russia's most hostile terrain.

Rescue: Spiridon Vinokurov, 48, was found by a helicopter rescue team lying face-first in the snow 80km from Berelekha village in the Sakha Republic

In pursuit: Mr Vinokurov said that two wolves had been following him and closed in as he became more tired

After four days of disorientation, Mr Vinokurov described how he could only muster enough energy to crawl along the ground, saying that he could 'literally feel the wolves breathing down my neck'.

A rescue team had been alerted by the hunter's family after he went missing during a snow storm.

He had been travelling on his snowmobile to visit them in the village of Aleko-Kyuel, 120km from his lodge. 

Mr Vinokurov's only option was to walk through the thick snow in the hope that he would stumble upon help, knowing the wolves were near, after the petrol had run out in his vehicle.

Describing the ordeal, he told the Siberian Times: 'I was driving and checking the traps set along my way. But then I kept missing the signs of the coming snow storm.

'So I lost my way and then the petrol run out in my Buran. I kept on walking.'

'Two wolves were following me along the 
way. They kept their distance as I walked - but as soon as I went down 
on all fours and started to crawl they cut the distance sharply and were
literally breathing down my neck.'

Recovery: Mr Vinokurov is now being treated in hospital for frostbite, with reports suggesting that may not require any amputations

When the rescue team found the hunter 80km from Berelekha village in the Sakha Republic he was still conscious.

Relatives initially scoured the area but only contacted emergency services on the fourth day.

Mr Vinokurov is now being treated in hospital for frostbite, with reports suggesting that may not  require any amputations. 

Nikolai Fateyev, from the Sakha Republic rescue team, said: 'We landed the helicopter and rushed to 
look at him.

'He was conscious still, but in a very bad state as he was 
badly frostbitten.

'Later inside the helicopter he said that when it came
to the day four of his journey he could not walk any more and was 
crawling.'
