Prince Albert of Monaco and his wife Princess Charlene have been pictured cheering on their home team, fresh from watching the Winter Olympics.

But it seems the quick dash from Sochi, Russia, to watch Monaco take on Paris Saint-Germain, may have left Princess Charlene a little tired.

The South African born beauty seemed to lack some of her husband's enthusiasm as she watched the teams draw.

Meanwhile, Prince Albert can be seen leaping for joy as his team scores.

Topshop boss Sir Philip Green was also pictured at the match, also looking less than thrilled with his team's performance.

The couple are ambassadors for Peace and Sport, and are regularly seen at sporting events.

The Princess represented South Africa at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, with her team finishing fifth in the Women's 4x100 m Medley. She retired from competitive swimming in 2007.

Ensuring her home-town of Durban, South Africa, becomes the premier city for swimming in the country, the princess is reportedly set to donate a 'large amount' to its swimming future.

Yesterday the couple were pictured wearing similar white jackets, gloves and stylish black sunglasses as they watched the Games in Sochi.
