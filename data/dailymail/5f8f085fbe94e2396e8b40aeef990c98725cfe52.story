A man has received nearly 300 phone calls after his number was broadcast on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz of the Year.

The comedian Jack Whitehall wrote down the number on the panel show, telling viewers it belonged to fellow panellist Jonathan Ross, and urged the audience to 'call him whenever you want'.

But the number belonged to Rakesh Sagar, a picture researcher, who has now received nearly 300 calls after the broadcaster allowed the number to be viewed.

The number was shown on the Big Fat Quiz after Whitehall scrawled it down and claimed it belonged to Jonathan Ross

A row has been brewing after Jack Whitehall and James Corden made a raft of vulgar jokes

Whitehall, 24, had made up the combination, which had too many digits on it to be genuine, and Channel 4 broadcast it - although they claim it was partially obscured and only shown briefly.

But as the extra digits came at the end of Mr Sagar's number, it meant people automatically dialled him, despite them typing the full combination.

Mr Sagar, 27, from London, has 
complained to Ofcom and is now taking legal advice over what further 
steps he can take, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Whitehall was spotted today as the furore over the show grew

Channel 4 has apologised to Mr Sagar, who says he does not want to change his number as he had paid for one that was 'easy to remember'.

But the broadcaster insisted viewers must have 'guessed' the number because it was partially obscured on screen.

The show had already resulted in more 
than 160 complaints to Ofcom and Channel 4 because of offensive and 
vulgar jokes made about the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Susan Boyle, 
Usain Bolt and Barack Obama.

The programme was broadcast on 
December 30 and immediately afterwards Mr Sagar, who had not watched the
show, began getting calls from people who hated Jonathan Ross and 
wanted to shout abuse, or people who thought they were calling 
Whitehall.

Mr Sagar told the Daily Telegraph: 'I didn’t even bother going to work on Monday because I knew my phone wouldn’t stop ringing and I couldn’t switch it off because a relative is ill and I needed to be contactable.'

A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'An illegible and non-functional number which contained more digits than a standard mobile number was shown very briefly on the contestant’s panel on Big Fat Quiz of the Year,' the newspaper reported.

'Whilst it was obscured and only shown briefly, some viewers have attempted to guess the number and this appears to have led to calls being made to this phone.

'We have apologised and have further obscured the digits on repeats of the show.'

Ofcom is 'assessing the complaints' but is yet to launch an investigation, a spokesman said.

Halfway through the two-hour show 
Corden took a bottle of red wine and two glasses from beneath his desk 
and poured himself and Whitehall a drink, then started eating pizza.

The pair were soon appeared to be drunk and Corden was slurring his words.

He then started to make crude comments about Britain’s Got Talent star Susan Boyle.Corden
and Whitehall continued to drink more and host Carr later pointed out 
that the pair had drunk a bottle of wine each. Afterwards Whitehall told
his Twitter followers: 'We got so drunk.'

Viewers took to Twitter and television forums to vent their dismay even as the programme was being broadcast.

The Big Fat Quiz of 2012 was far from unusual among programmes billed as 'light entertainment', in the way it revelled in lewd, humiliating jokes

Whitehall comes from a privileged background.

His father is Michael Whitehall, 72, a former theatrical agent turned producer. His clients over the years have included Judi Dench, Colin Firth, Richard E. Grant, ­Daniel Day-Lewis and Edward Fox.

Mother Hilary, 51, is a former actress (stage name Hilary Gish) who retrained as a 'doula' — someone who assists a pregnant woman before, during and after childbirth.

Jack has a sister Molly, 23, and 20-year-old brother, Barnaby. His godfather is actor Nigel Havers, an old showbiz friend of both his parents.

Last year, the family sold their six-bedroom house overlooking Putney Common for £4.25 million and moved to another house overlooking the Thames nearby, for which they paid £2.55 million. The new property is mortgage-free.

He was privately educated at The Harrodian School in South-West London and £24,000-a-year ­Marlborough College in Wiltshire. Another pupil, the Duchess of ­Cambridge, then Kate Middleton, was five years his senior.
