The widow of a Florida police officer killed while escorting
President Barack Obama's motorcade has sued her husband's sheriff's department,
saying it bears some responsibility for her husband's death.

Jupiter Police Officer Bruce St. Laurent was killed when his
motorcycle was struck by a pickup truck during a September 2012 visit by Obama.

His wife, Brenda St. Laurent, is suing the Palm Beach County
Sheriff's Office.

Before the crash: Bruce St. Laurent was killed when his motorcycle was struck by a pickup truck during a September 2012 visit by Obama

Make way: Police on motorcycles tend to go ahead of the presidential bus and following cars, as seen in this September 2012 campaign trip in Florida when St Laurent was killed

Scene: St Laurent was killed when he was hit trying to clear the motorcade route

St. Laurent was killed while he prepared to shut down a
stretch of Interstate 95 in West Palm Beach ahead of the motorcade.

The impact with the car pushed the 55-year-old officer and
his motorcycle to the guard rail.

He was transported to a local hospital but declared dead
after arriving at St. Mary's Medical Center.

He had been a member of the Jupiter Police Department for 20
years.

He was survived by his wife of more than 30 years and their
four children.

His wife says the sheriff's office 'negligently allowed' the
driver of the truck to enter the highway.

Suing: St Laurent's wife Brenda (right) has filed a lawsuit against the sheriff's office arguing that they should have done more to protect her husband (left) who worked for them for more than 20 years

The sheriff's office had no immediate comment.

The lawsuit, which was filed last week, seeks unspecified
damages.

At the time, his death was the fourth fatal accident that
involved motorcycles connected with the president's motorcade.
