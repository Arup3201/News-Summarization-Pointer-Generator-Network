Lewis Hamilton began the new Formula One season in stunning fashion with a crushing qualifying performance to grab the fourth pole position of his career for the Australian Grand Prix.

It is clear that after a dominant 2014 from Mercedes they will again be the team to beat in 2015 as reigning champion Hamilton blasted his way to top spot on the grid at Melbourne's Albert Park, putting even team-mate Nico Rosberg in the shade.

Hamilton finished with a lap of one minute 26.327secs, a staggering 0.6secs clear of Rosberg as Mercedes locked out the front row, with Williams' Felipe Massa the best of the rest, but 1.4secs down on the 30-year-old Briton.

10 Maldonado

Rosberg crosses the line, but it is only good enough for P2, a mighty half-a-second down on Hamilton. He had an awful first sector, but was quicker than Hamilton in the final sector. 

Bottas wobbles out of the final corner, but he still does enough to qualify fourth and Hamilton is going even quicker... 

Hamilton complaining about his tyres on his out-lap from the pit-lane... will it make a difference? Ricciardo is the first driver on a timed lap. He crosses the line to clock a 1:28.329 to move him up to third, but here comes Kimi and he goes third above Ricciardo. 

Right, here we go for the final runs of the afternoon. Can anyone beat Hamilton to Australian Grand Prix pole? 

All of the drivers are back in their respective garages and it is Hamilton from Vettel, Massa, Raikkonen, Maldonado, Ricciardo, Grosjean and Sainz. Neither Rosberg nor Bottas have posted a time. 

Hamilton crosses the line and the Briton posts a 1.26:419 which is 1.3 seconds quicker than the next driver in Vettel, but Rosberg runs WIDE at the penultimate corner and takes a trip across the grass. He aborts his lap and dives into the pit-lane. The German will now have just one shot at pole. 

Bottas complaining about his brakes during a sloppy lap for the Finn which has seen him slide all over the track in his Williams. 

The cars flood out on to the Albert Park track for their first runs in the top-10 shootout. Rosberg, in his Mercedes, is the last driver to leave the pit-lane. Game on.

The final 12-minute session is underway in Melbourne... Hamilton or Rosberg? Rosberg or Hamilton? Place your bets now. 

Here’s a frustrated Will Stevens, who hasn’t taken to the track in his Manor this weekend: It is frustrating for me and the team. We want to be out on the track. The cars are ready to go but there are a few gremlins which are keeping us back. I want to be out there as much as anything. Coming from Abu Dhabi last year I know what a race meeting is like. I am heading back to the UK, but I know the team are heading out early to Malaysia so we will be in better shape than we are now. There are a few issues with the software which means we can’t get out there.

17-year-old Max Verstappen will start a commendable 12th on his grand prix debut, but the Dutchman has been out-qualified by his team-mate. Carlos Sainz Jnr, also on his F1 bow, sticks his Toro Rosso in Q3. 

Home favourite Ricciardo is on a hot-lap here as he looks to cement his place in the top-10 shootout. He crosses the line with a 1:28.679 to bump him up to sixth, and receives a smattering of applause from the Melbourne crowd. 

Hamilton and Rosberg are happy they've done enough, and they are back in the Mercedes garage. Remember, five drivers will be eliminated from this 15-minute session. It's Kvyat, Nasr, Hulkenberg and Perez in the drop-zone with two minutes to run.

Back on track, and Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg. The Briton is some two tenths quicker than his Mercedes team-mate. It is Bottas up next, albeit over one second down on Hamilton. 

And here is a gloomy, but ever-positive, JENSON BUTTON: ‘I think the positives are, looking at winter testing it was difficult, having issues and running short, and suddenly you put a team at a race weekend and you have to stick to the schedule. It was never going to be competitive here but still there is a good feeling about the car. The basic car is there. It is nice that Honda have a bit more experience today. It is going to be a really difficult tomorrow. We have not done a race distance yet.’

The second session is underway and the Sauber of Felipe Nasr is the first driver to take to the track. We must mention that his team-mate Marcus Ericsson was the other non-McLaren driver to be eliminated from Q1.

KEVIN MAGNUSSEN: I don’t think we expected anything else. It is tough. It is a learning process and we have got to be patient. Going forward is the main priority. We need to learn from the race.    

Stunning. Both McLaren drivers are ELIMINATED from the opening qualifying session of 2015. Button improves his time to leapfrog Magnussen, but they will start 17th and 18th respectively. They will start on the final row of the grid. Ouch.  

Kvyat is given one timed lap to stick his Red Bull into Q2 and he posts a 1:30.402 which is good enough for P13... but what can the McLarens do? 

But Sainz pops his Toro Rosso into P4 and Maldonado goes ninth. That leaves Magnussen and Button in the drop-zone.

Kvyat, yet to take to the track, with less than five minutes. With Manor not running, only three drivers will be eliminated from Q1; Pastor Maldonado and Carlos Sainz are the two drivers set to miss out...

Hamilton quickly usurps Rosberg however, and he tops the timesheets in Melbourne. Five minutes to go. 

But Rosberg, still on the medium compound tyres, pops in a 1:28.906 to go fastest. 

So, with eight minutes to go in Q1, Vettel leads from Bottas, Raikkonen, Hamilton, Massa, Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Verstappen, Grosjean and Perez. 

Rosberg, on the medium compound - remember Ferrari are on the softer, quicker compound - goes fourth, a second slower than Vettel. Sainz has a wee spin in his Toro Rosso as Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:30.277.  That leaves him in third behind the two Ferraris. 

Back on track and it is Kimi Raikkonen with a 1:30.188 who goes easily fastest. And his new Ferrari team-mate, the four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, is even quicker. The German crosses the line some seven tenths faster than Raikkonen. 

Hamilton, on the medium compound takes a wee trip across the grass on his out-lap. Not the ideal start to qualifying from the Brit there. He is reporting 'really big vibrations' on his current set of tyres.

Sainz is the first to cross the line and he pops in a 1:33.094. Hamilton meanwhile, is out on track in his Mercedes.

Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that Manor, who pulled everything out of the bag to make it to Melbourne, will not take part in qualifying so they will not race this weekend.   

The pit-lane is open and the first of three qualifying sessions is underway at Albert Park. It is the Toro Rosso of Carlos Sainz Jnr who is the first driver to take to the track…

The British driver and his team-mate Kevin Magnussen, who is deputising for the injured Fernando Alonso, endured a miserable day during practice for the season opener at the Albert Park Circuit.

The McLaren pair, hampered by reliability problems to their new Honda engine, managed only 13 laps between them in Friday’s opening session and were five seconds down on Nico Rosberg’s best time for Mercedes.

So, with 10 minutes to go until the start of qualifying, why not catch up on the very latest news from Melbourne, starting with Hamilton and his hope that he will be remembered as a legend when he retires from Formula One.  

The British team have renewed their iconic relationship with Japanese engine supplier Honda, the Japanese engine supplier which saw McLaren win four straight drivers’ and constructors’ titles between 1988 and 1991. But they’ve struggled in winter testing, and it hasn’t got any better in Melbourne. Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen, standing in for the absent Fernando Alonso, propped up the timesheets yesterday. And they, along with the Red Bulls of Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat, were slowest again this morning. But Button remains, retained by McLaren for a sixth season, remains typically optimistic: ‘This is the package I think will challenge Mercedes. I really think that…. It is just going to take some time.’

Lewis Hamilton ended both practice sessions behind Nico Rosberg yesterday, but the Briton was back on top this morning. He was almost one second clear of Sebastian Vettel with Rosberg in third.

Good morning and welcome to MailOnline’s coverage for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. We kick off our live coverage for 2015 with qualifying at Albert Park, the traditional host to the first Formula One race of the campaign. Lewis Hamilton is the overwhelming favourite to defend his crown which he won so dramatically last year. But his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who finished runner-up in 2014, is expected to be nipping at his gearbox throughout what promises to be another scintillating campaign. We’ll cover every qualifying and race live, so stick with us from the season opener in Melbourne right down to the final race of the campaign in Abu Dhabi eight months from now…
