The lone holdout juror in the Jodi Arias trial says she saved the killer's life because she had 'mental issues.'

The Arizona woman known anonymously as Juror 17 says she sought to be as objective as possible in deciding Arias' fate and concluded 'because of her genetic makeup, she didn't have the capability of coping with her tumultuous relationship' with Travis Alexander.

Juror 17 told KPNX that journal entries also swayed her. 'There were entries where she could be completely happy and positive in the morning and suicidal later on that day,' Juror 17 revealed.

The 33-year-old mother insisted she does believe in the death penalty, just not in this instance.

'I actually do,' she said. 'I think it's necessary, but it's something that shouldn't be taken lightly and it should be a case by case.'

Speaking out: The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Jodi Arias this month is speaking out in her own defense after receiving continued threats and ridicule

Mentally ill? Juror 17 has revealed she based her decision to save Jodi Arias's life on what she perceived to be the killer's lapses in mental clarity and her emotional instability

In this case, Juror 17 said the punishment was not warranted because Arias was not emotionally sound--despite the ruthless way she slashed Alexander's throat so deeply he was nearly beheaded.

'She wasn't insane, but there were months spent on showing her mental deterioration,' Juror 17 said of the Arias defense. 'I think she looked a little bit more human to me just by her journal writings.'

Juror 17's decision has won her a barrage of social media lashings, ridicule and even death threats, she revealed yesterday.

However, she maintains she indeed had Travis Alexander's family in the back of her mind while she decided.

'Travis' life mattered and I was asked to put my personal feelings aside and to just look at the evidence they presented. And to go with my honest belief,' Juror 17 said.

However, 17 would not go so far to say that, had Alexander been her son, she would have wanted Arias dead.

'I don't know if I would,' she told KPNX.

Juror 17 on Monday denied allegations she was some 'stealth juror' intent on saving the infamous murderer's life--one of many allegations made against her by social media supporters of Alexander's family.

Juror 17 also addressed her past encounters with Arias prosecutor Juan Martinez, facts that would not be revealed until after the March 5 deadlock announcement.

'It wasn't easy, I didn't ask for it, I didn't want it,' she said. 'All I did was answer the questions truthfully. I didn't want to be involved. I didn't want this pressure.'

Mostly, those questions revolved around what Juror 17 knew about the case going in, which, she insists, was very little.

'I live in Arizona so I had heard about the case and I had seen just when they would come up on the news,' she told KPNX. 'I would hear people talk about it and it wasn't something I really wanted to get sucked in to.'

When she arrived to the courthouse, Juror 17 recalls that there were many cases she could have been called to. In now way, she says, could she have manipulated it so she would.

However, her detractors point to her previous connection to Juan Martinez as proof Juror 17 wanted to be in the Arias trial and wanted Martinez to lose.

Fifteen years ago, Juror 17's then husband was tried and convicted for robbery by Martinez and then sent to jail.

Juror 17 says she only recognized Martinez from television. Besides, she loathed her ex-husband and had been open about his abuse when question during jury selection.

'My struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him,' she told KPNX. 'It's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job.'

Nonetheless, the conspiracy theorizing and social media vexation raged on.  

Grudge? Juror 17 says she was simply fulfilling he civic duty by showing up for jury service in October. However, her critics accuse the 33-year-old of having it out for prosecutor Juan Martinez (center) for his having put her then-husband away for robbery 15 years ago

Meanwhile, it was revealed March 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout's objectivity because she had previously watched a Lifetime movie about the Arias case, and prosecutors were upset at the juror's social media activity as she went on Facebook and liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network.

The juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted Arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend Travis Alexander nearly seven years ago.

'My opinion isn't being heard,' the judge quoted the holdout as saying.

The holdout's identity was leaked through a Twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about Alexander, while a pro-Arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence Arias to death for the 2008 killing.

'Juror safety and the protection of jurors' personal and confidential information are topics the Court takes very seriously,' the Maricopa County Superior Court said in a statement.

Dwane Cates, a criminal defense attorney in Phoenix who isn't involved in the Arias case, said the leaks won't change the outcome of the case, noting that mistrial decisions can't be appealed.

Arias was convicted of murder in Alexander's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated.

A new jury was picked to decide her punishment after the first jury deadlocked on that question. 

Lifetime movie: Juror 17 admitted to seeing the Lifetime film about the case (above) in 'bits and pieces' while being screened for her service. Her fellow jurors would later use this to try to get her removed from the jury

A mistrial was declared after five days of deliberations, removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for Arias. The judge is scheduled to decide on April 13 whether Arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years. 

Most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty. Judge Sherry Stephens had individually questioned some of the jurors, including the holdout, who said she wasn't socializing at lunch with other jurors in an effort to be impartial.

Stephens said the holdout had disclosed, before being picked as a juror, that she had seen the Lifetime movie about the Arias case, but never watched it all the way through. The judge said the holdout juror didn't commit misconduct because she clearly disclosed that she had seen the movie.

The judge also refused a request by prosecutors to remove the holdout from the jury because she had liked on her Facebook page another film that Arias found influential.

And the case's chief investigator said the holdout, who had claimed she had recently been keeping away from Facebook, had liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network.
