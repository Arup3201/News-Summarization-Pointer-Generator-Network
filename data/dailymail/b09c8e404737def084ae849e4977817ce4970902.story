Job seekers on unemployment benefits have no right to reject work just because they can't find their dream jobs, Prime Minister Tony Abbott says.

From 2015, thousands of unemployed people under 30 will be forced to work for their welfare payments as part of the government's new budget measures.

They will have to wait at least six months before receiving their first payment.

Mr Abbott said job seekers should be taking any job that is offered rather than being on welfare.

'People have no right to hold out for the job of their dreams while they are on unemployment benefits,' he told journalists in Adelaide on Saturday.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott says those on welfare benefits should take any job that is offered to them instead of waiting for their dream job

He said: 'Frankly, that is the least that people should be prepared to do under those circumstances.'

Welfare groups have warned the tough earn-or-learn measures could result in young people taking up petty crime or ending up on the streets.

Mr Abbott also said on Saturday he would not bow to pressure and compromise over the budget's unpopular measures.

The leader was again defending the tough line the Federal Government has taken to curb the nation's debt after this week's student protests opposing university deregulation measures.

Earlier this month, Treasurer Joe Hockey handed power back to universities to set their own tuition costs in his first budget.

Mr Abbott said he would not surrender his budget in the wake of public backlash to compromise over its the most unpopular measures.

The Prime Minister said he was confident the Senate would approve the coalition's budget because the alternative would be a double dissolution election.

His comments come after senior government ministers indicated they might compromise on some key reforms, such as higher education interest rates and the GP co-payment, after fierce public backlash and a hostile Senate.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne said he would be willing to compromise on the tough measures despite Mr Abbott saying his party would not cave to pressure

He said his cabinet 'absolutely' understood the 'iron necessity' of sticking with the difficult budget measures.

But, after facing a slew of student protests, Education Minister Christopher Pyne said he was open to compromising on some reforms.

He said the rethink was because the government did not have a majority in the upper house.

'We will of course seek to consult and negotiate with the minor parties and the crossbenches to ensure these important reforms are delivered,' Mr Pyne said in a statement.

And Mr Abbott concedes that negotiations were inevitable.

He said: 'You have got to negotiate your legislation through the parliament.

'Because let's face it, there have been many governments over many years that have had to negotiate budgets through the Senate.'

Opposition spokesman Tony Burke said the government would vet any changes to the budget measures through parliamentary process in the same way they have done with current ones

Last week, it seemed Mr Abbott had cooled on the idea of a double dissolution election after early indications revealed incoming Senate crossbenchers were unlikely to keep their seats if a new election was called.

The Opposition as well as the Greens and Palmer United Party have vowed they will not support critical changes, including the Medicare co-payment and pension cuts.

Industry groups are also being consulted in the process to 'refine the details' of the changes, including two tertiary education stakeholder groups.

Opposition finance spokesman Tony Burke said the government's willingness to compromise showed it was in disarray and its budget was unravelling.

Mr Burke said Labor would apply the same 'tests' to vote down any measures changed in the parliamentary process - in the way it is opposing changes affecting pensioners, university students, Medicare, and fuel and cost-of-living prices.

The Australian Medical Association is set to hold urgent talks with Health Minister Peter Dutton to seek a compromise on all medical co-payments flagged in the budget.

The association passed a vote at its national conference on Saturday to push to have the payment targeted at higher-income earners.

They fear co-payments will negatively impact on vulnerable groups and add pressure on hospitals.

President Steve Hambleton said in a statement the association was 'well-positioned' to assist the government come up with 'a fairer and more equitable model'.
