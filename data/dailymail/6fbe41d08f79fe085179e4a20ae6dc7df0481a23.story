The body of a creative socialite, known for her eye-catching jewellery and eccentric outfits, has been discovered in her Nevada apartment several weeks after she died.

Amber Bently's body was found on Friday after an official, who had arrived at the apartment building to serve an eviction notice, raised the alarm.

The 34-year-old estranged wife of property businessman Christopher Bently, had not been reported missing, but the sheriff's office said there was no evidence of foul play.

A cause of death has not yet been determined and the results of a toxicology test could take up to eight weeks to arrive.

Douglas County Sheriff's office said Mrs
Bently had been living alone in the apartment where her body was found 
in Gardnerville, outside Carson City. 

Mrs Bently, who had separated from her husband last year after being married for about ten years, was well known for her parties and the couple's building renovations in San Francisco.

The couple, who supported environmental charities, also supported the Burning Man arts festival, which is held in Nevada's Black Rock Desert, near Reno.

After they separated last year Mrs Bently swapped their Nob Hill penthouse and Stinson Beach home for a place in Sausalito before moving to an apartment in Gardnerville, where she had been raised, according to SF Gate.

Mr Bently, who is currently in London, said they had not divorced and described his wife as 'a wonderful human being who contributed so much to San Francisco'.

He added: 'She was greatly loved by family and friends, and we feel her loss deeply.'

She had helped him run Bently Holdings, a property management company with offices in Minden, Nevada, and San Francisco, during the week, and designed jewellery on her days off.

Mrs Bently, whose jewellery was exhibited at the de Young Museum in San Francisco in 2009, also helped her 
husband with a luxurious revamp of the former Federal Reserve Bank in downtown San 
Francisco, which they renamed Bently Reserve.

Mr Bently also runs several companies founded by his late father, Donald Bently, an engineer, philanthropist and businessman who died in October at the age of 87.

The couple first joined the San Francisco social scene in the mid-2000s, and were known as much for their eccentric outfits as their backing of environmental groups.

As well as eye-catching accessories that
she designed, Ms Bently was known for her elaborate outfits, including a
dress lit by LEDs, which she wore to the San Francisco Opera Gala in 
2010.

About four years ago, they couple featured as the 'new kids on the block' on the San Francisco Social Diary website, after throwing a pajama party at their Nob Hill penthouse.

They
loved the Burning Man atmosphere so much that they felt a pajama party 
was the best way to introduce their festival and city friends for their 
house warming.

At the time, Social Diary reported: 'This artsy crowd lived up to expectations, no two dressed alike. PJs covered the gamut from Brooks Brothers and flannels to oriental robes and black negligees ... On the way home, I thought it was hilarious seeing guests trotting around Nob Hill in their jammies.'

In a sign of her generous nature to environmental charities, in September 2007, Mrs Bently flew Tippi 
Hedren to San Francisco for a fundraising event.

A portion of the money raised by selling Mrs Bently's hand-crafted 
jewellery was donated to the actress's
Roar Foundation.

The designer created her gold pieces, inset with crystals and stones, in the basement of their Nob Hill home.

She told SF Luxe in 2007 that her interest in design had come about after she made bead necklaces with her husband to wear at the Burning Man festival.

'We kept going back to the bead store, and I kept making jewellery. And finally I'm like "I've got to start selling these because I have too much,' she said.

Mrs Bently added that she was drawn to the healing properties of rocks, adding: 'I wear a lot of rubies because I feel in balancing the chakras you are more creative and you are more open to a creative outlook.'

Her one-off jewellery pieces, which she 
sold in stores and at charity functions in San Francisco, reached prices of between $500
to $6,500, according to Heavy.com.

As well as environmental charities, Mrs Bently supported the Dress for Success program that helps provide women with suitable outfits to wear for job interviews in 2008, according to the San Francisco Sentinel.

The couple were also fans of the Burning Man festival, and Mr Bently served on the advisory board of the Black Rock Arts Foundation as well as the Burning Man Project.

Tomas McCabe, executive director of Black Rock Arts Foundation, said foundation members were devastated to hear of Mrs Bently's death.

'She was a super, outgoing, very creative person. She was always joyful. She made amazing jewelry,' he said.

The couple's love of art and spirituality led them on several trips to India, Indonesia and Thailand. After returning from one trip, where she learned about the Ayurveda healing practices, Mrs Bently opened a spa in the city.

A man who answered the phone at her husband's firm, Bently Holdings, said the company would have no comment.
