If French is the language of love and English is the language of business, then where does that leave the German vernacular?

With its strong consonants and sharp vowels, to many the German tongue can sound a little harsh compared to some of its continental counterparts.

Now, a video posted online has demonstrated just how some of the most delicate and demure words in other languages can sound guttural and even angry when spoken in German.

'Überraschung': The German word for 'surprise' comes out a little harsh-sounding in the video

'Avion': The French word for 'aeroplane' meanwhile sounds easier on the ears

Stereotypes: The British language appears to sound inoffensive compared to others

The video, below, features five characters demonstrating how certain words sound in the French, English, Italian, Spanish and German languages.

In an amusing comparison words such as 'butterfly', 'daisy' and even 'pen' sound jarring and severe when spoken in German - with a little help from the actor's choice of expression, of course.

Dressed in lederhosen and with a pint of wheat beer sat next to him, the German man makes the words sound angry and coarse when he translates the words into 'schmetterling', 'gänseblümchen' and 'kugelschreiber' respectively. 

Ascribing to the most basic of national stereotypes, the French woman wears a beret and striped top while a glass of red wine and a baguette lie on the table in front of her.

The British character holds an umbrella and has what appears to be a pot of tea while the Italian looks to be enjoying a bowl of spaghetti bolognese with his glass of wine.

The Mexican meanwhile is not only wearing a sombrero, but he also has his guitar beside him along with a bottle of beer which is flavoured with tequila.

'Aero': Despite being known for their passion, the Italian language can sound lyrical and romantic

'Sopresa': The Spanish word for 'surprise' sounds quite a bit different to the German version

Despite its reputation for being harsh the German language is loved by many across the globe.

For some, the language's logic and its set of rules are among its most attractive features while others simply enjoy the way it sounds.

German is a West Germanic language and is one of the world's major languages.

It is related to both English and Dutch and the majority of its vocabulary comes from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family.

There is however a number of words which do derive from Latin and Greek.
