Paul Pogba is one of the hottest properties in world football at present, with headlines in European papers suggesting as many as four major clubs are after the Juventus midfielder.

La Liga rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona are set to start the bidding war, according to Spanish publications Marca and AS.

The latter suggest that French compatriot Zinedine Zidane, currently the Real Madrid Castilla coach, is pushing hard for the hierarchy to sign the 21-year-old.

AS say Zinedine Zidane will speak to the Juventus midfielder while also commenting on Toni Kroos' play-time

Marca claim he offers great value on the pitch and as a marketing image and at a price of around £72.5million and offer the headline 'PogBOOM'!'.

Papers in Italy also believe Barca and Real are the frontrunners, but that PSG and Manchester United are also interested.

Pogba is a former United youth international, but felt he didn't have enough first-team opportunities under Sir Alex Ferguson and left for Juventus on a free in 2012.

Elsewhere, Toni Kroos' importance to Real Madrid this season has been stressed by AS.

The German midfielder has 'never played so much' having made an appearance in 38 of Real's 40 official games this season, and Carlo Ancelotti won't be giving him a rest against Villarreal.

In the Italian press there are several previews ahead of the Serie A showdown between Juventus and Roma, as well as more news on Pogba.

Tuttosport also claim that Jose Mourinho is pressuring Chelsea to sign Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi.
