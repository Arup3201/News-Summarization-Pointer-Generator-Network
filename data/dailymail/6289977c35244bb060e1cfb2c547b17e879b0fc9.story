TV presenter Davina McCall is gearing up to release a book on how she has successfully banished sugar from her diet

She's known for her bestselling workout DVDs – and now TV presenter Davina McCall is gearing up to release a book on how she has successfully banished sugar from her diet. The recipe book, Five Weeks To Sugar Free, will be published in January to capitalise on the good intentions of people making New Year resolutions.

Davina, right, says: ‘Every time I pick up a magazine, I read another horrifying fact about sugar. I was a committed sugar addict until I managed to stop for three years, only to take it up again with gusto. This book shows you how I finally quit but still get to eat lovely puddings.’

The book will be the first of three, and if it’s anything like Davina’s hugely popular workout DVDs, which trade on her attainable image as a busy mother of three, it should be a huge hit.

Taking probiotic supplements can be effective in reducing the occurrence and duration of sore throats, coughs and colds among children.  According to a study in the European Journal Of Clinical Nutrition, pre-school youngsters who took a chewable ProVen Fit For School blackcurrant-flavour tablet had less severe symptoms and, as a result, needed fewer days off. The tablets are suitable for four- to 16-year-olds.

It pays to volunteer, especially as you get older, because it staves off depression. Officials at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto examined 73 studies published over 45 years that looked at adults aged 50-plus in formal volunteering roles. They found that those who helped out had reduced symptoms of depression, better overall health and lived longer. Researchers, whose findings were published online in Psychological Bulletin, said that between two and three hours a week was the optimal amount to volunteer.
