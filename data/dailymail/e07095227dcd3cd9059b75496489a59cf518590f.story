A 'glowing' statue of the Virgin Mary has brought hundreds of pilgrims flocking to a house in a small town in southern Belgium.

Police in Jalhay have been forced to post guards around a pavilion erected by the retired owners of what is being referred to as 'the mysterious glowing Virgin'.

On one day this week alone 500 people visited the house in the normally quiet town to see the statue, which witnesses claim emits a dull glow in the dark.

Mystery solved: Scientists found that the statue was covered in paint containing zinc sulphide which made it glow

But local Catholic authorities, who 
have sent clergymen to investigate, remain cautious about claiming for 
definite whether there is a natural or religious explanation for the 
statue's luminescence.

The 
phenomenon was first noticed in the middle of January and has gradually 
attracted growing crowds.

Local media report that some of those visiting
 the statue claim to have been cured of ailments.

The
 statue, which is about a foot high, represents the 'Virgin of Banneux',
 from the name of a nearby village where a young girl was said to have 
witnessed an appearance by the Virgin in 1933.

The
 town has since become a pilgrim destination in largely Catholic 
Belgium, although Catholic authorities from the Banneux sanctuary are 
expressing caution about the 'glowing' Virgin.

'It's certain that something is going on but I can't tell you whether there is a natural or a miraculous explanation,' said Father Leo Palm, who was sent to investigate the statue by the bishop of Liege.

The owners of the statue have refused to allow it to be removed for further examination, saying 'she is fine where she is'.
