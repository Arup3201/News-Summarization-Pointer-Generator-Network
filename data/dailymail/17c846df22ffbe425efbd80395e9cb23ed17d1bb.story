A prisoner has been banned from receiving his weekly copy of Shooting Times by jail chiefs because it contained pictures of guns after the Government cracked down on inmate perks.

But convict Gregg Hill bemoaned the decision and said he loved flicking through the countryside magazine, which also includes articles on 'farming, conservation and fishing’.

Writing in Inside Time this week, ‘the national newspaper for prisoners’, Hill said the decision by bosses came after the recent crackdown on 'holiday camp prisons' by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.

Crack down: A prisoner has been banned from receiving his weekly copy of Shooting Times by jail chiefs in Cambridgeshire because it contained pictures of guns after the Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (right) curbed inmate perks

Mr Grayling announced this week that prisoners will no longer have an automatic right to a TV in their cell, will have all 18-rated DVDs confiscated and be forced to wear a prison uniform in their first two weeks inside.

But Hill, who is currently enjoying a stay at HMP Littlehey, a Category C prison in Cambridgeshire, decried the decision and described himself as a ‘country boy’ at heart.

He said Shooting Times, which has a weekly circulation of just under 22,200, and was first published in 1882, did not tell him how to make a machine gun.

He moaned: ‘Not only are we being treated like impressionable children by being denied the right to buy 18 rated DVDs, but it appears I can no longer get my magazine The Shooting Times because it contains guns.

‘The Shooting Times, for these who don't know, is full of articles on shooting, fieldcraft, farming, conservation, fishing, dog breeding and cookery.

‘Nowhere in its pages does it inform you how to make an AK47 out of everyday items you might find in a prison cell.’

‘I am a country boy and these things are my interest.’

He added: ‘Next they'll be banning performance car magazines in case someone builds a Ferrari out of prison-issue tracksuits.’

Mr Grayling said this week that it was wrong that some prisoners were 'watching daytime television while the rest of the country goes out to work'.

He said: ‘For too long, there has been an expectation that privileges are an automatic right, given simply as a reward for staying out of trouble.

‘This cannot continue. Prisoners need to earn privileges, not simply through the avoidance of bad behaviour.

'But also by working, taking part in education or accepting the opportunities to rehabilitate themselves.’

The changes followed a review which criticised the ‘frills’ available to prisoners but unaffordable for ordinary families.

A Prison Service spokesperson said today: 'Items such as this are not considered appropriate for prisoners.'
