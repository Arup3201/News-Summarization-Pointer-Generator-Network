Once upon a time, Arsenal played Chelsea and, more often than not, beat them. But that was before the Roman empire swept into Stamford Bridge and altered the Premier League landscape.

Instead of the fixture that Gunners fans looked forward to the most, it has become the match they must secretly dread.

It was another Bridge – Wayne – who landed the first blow on behalf of owner Roman Abramovich and announced the arrival of a new order when he grabbed an 87th minute winner to clinch a 3-2 aggregate Champions League win at Highbury in March 2004.

Things have never been quite the same, since. And Bridge’s goal was the turning point.

Emirates supporters look away now, as a reminder of the good old days brings home how fortunes have changed in the Premier League era.

Post Roman, the teams have played 28 times. Arsenal have won just six matches in all competitions, drawn seven and lost 15.

Contrast and compare that with 1992-2003, before the Russian billionaire turned Chelsea from fancy dans to title winners.

The teams faced each other 22 times. Arsenal lost only three, won 12 and drew seven and were the undisputed kings of the capital.

It all looked so rosy, in February 2004, when Arsene Wenger’s team knocked Chelsea out of the FA Cup and then beat them 2-1 at Stamford Bridge in what was then known as the Premiership.

Prick Vieira and Edu cancelled out Eidur Gudjohnsen’s early strike while the Icelander was also sent off in the second half.

One month later the rivals met in the Champions League. The first leg was drawn 1-1 and Arsenal were over-riding favourites. Jose Reyes gave the Gunners the lead on half-time only for Frank Lampard to level the scores before Bridge had the final say.

Arsenal fans could argue that it was not in the Premier League, which is what really counts over a season.

The same could be applied to the Community Shield in 2005 when a Didier Drogba double ensured a 2-1 Chelsea win.

But later that August, Arsenal could no longer claim to be so superior as Drogba scored the only goal in a 1-0 Premier League home victory.

The return was in December the same year. Arjen Robben and Joe Cole both found the net at Highbury and Chelsea had done the double over their North London neighbours.

As far as the neutral is concerned, however, this is a match which tends to throw up lots of goals, plenty of controversy and the enduring feud between Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho.

Arsenal fans will not need long memories to recall a rare fine moment – the 5-3 extravaganza in October 2011 when Robin van Persie scored twice in the last five minutes to complete his hat-trick after it looked as if Juan Mata had clinched a 3-3 draw.

Then again, they will not want reminding about what happened last season. Down to ten men (even if Kieran Gibbs was sent off instead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain) and on the end of a 6-0 thrashing.

Will the tide turn again on Sunday? The bookies suggest not.
