This is a problem familiar to every professional party-giver. After a night of Bacchanalian revelries to rival the last days of Rome, the exact details of the previous evening’s events can seem a bit hazy in the cold light of day.

This seems to have happened to multi-millionaire PR guru Matthew Freud.

After throwing a lavish bash last weekend at his vast Cotswolds home to celebrate his 50th birthday, it appeared to slip his mind that one of the guests was Prime Minister David Cameron.

Party host Matthew Freud, pictured with his wife Elisabeth Murdoch, is a formidable networker. He once threw a Martini in the face of an editor who criticised his wife, and smeared chocolate cake on Hugh Grant's shirt

Such a lapse of memory would suggest that even by the impressive standards of Freud’s previous extravagant soirees, this was quite some knees-up.

But it is not every day that one’s champagne-drinking guests are entertained by rock stars Bono and Bob Geldof with a rendition of Sixties hit Dancing In The Street by Martha & The Vandellas.

U2 frontman Bono also led the celebrity-packed throng in a rendition of Happy Birthday, while Tony Blair’s former henchman-in-chief Alastair Campbell apparently played the bagpipes.

David and Samantha Cameron were at the bash - but it seems their host momentarily forgot

It goes without saying that Freud and his wife Elisabeth Murdoch (daughter of media mogul Rupert) have a wide circle of friends.

A trio of chefs — Heston Blumenthal, Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson — were among the guests, alongside Amanda Holden, Jemima Khan and outdoor adventurer Bear Grylls.

Also there were Tony and Cherie Blair, who are said to have ‘tripped the light fantastic’ on the dance floor all night, and the model Kate Moss.

Mrs Blair, who likes a good sing-song, was reported to have performed a duet with Irish rocker Bono.

One guest told me that the Freuds hired a professional tattoo artist for the night to give guests free body art. But the PM’s wife Samantha, who already has a dolphin tattoo on her ankle, did not take up the offer.

It was, of course, a family celebration — as any 50th birthday party should be. One of Freud’s teenage children sang a Paul Simon song, while her siblings showed a fun-poking film of their father.

According to one guest, Freud gave an ‘unusually humble speech in which he thanked everyone for putting up with him’.

The Noah’s Ark-themed bash took place at Burford Priory, a 22-bedroom, Grade-I-listed Jacobean pile, set in 20 acres of Oxfordshire countryside, which Freud and Miss Murdoch bought for £6 million in 2008 and have spent a fortune doing up.

The rambling nature of the house may be the reason why Freud momentarily forgot that Mr Cameron — who, like his hosts, is a member of the so-called Chipping Norton set and has a house nearby — was at the party. When one broadsheet diary columnist asked Freud if the PM had attended, the PR man reportedly replied: ‘No. Please let me know if you would like more explicit clarification.’

Cherie Blair, right, wife of former PM Tony, was said to have performed a duet with U2 frontman Bono, left. The Irish rocker also sang Happy Birthday while Mr Blair's former spin doctor Alistair Campbell played the bagpipes

However, the following day an associate clarified not only that Mr Cameron had, in fact, been there, but that Chancellor George Osborne was, too.

The confusion led the veteran political commentator Andrew Neil to tweet mischievously: ‘Matthew Freud “forgets” David Cameron was at his 50th. As you do.’

So why all the intrigue?

Part of the sensitivity is the fact that some people have questioned the judgment of the Prime Minister and Mr Osborne in attending the home of Rupert Murdoch’s daughter at a time when key executives of his newspaper empire are on trial at the Old Bailey for phone-hacking.

A friend of Mr Cameron — himself a former TV PR man, of course — defended his decision to attend, insisting: ‘David is an old friend of Matthew. He’s known him for donkey’s years and David’s incredibly loyal. It was his friend’s party, so he naturally he felt he should go.’

And who could resist the lure of an invitation to one of the Freuds’ hot‑ticket events?

The couple’s joint fortune is in excess of £250 million, with Freud Communications representing global brands such as Google, Pepsi, Asda and Guinness.

A previous party took place two years ago when guests included a Who’s Who of the political and celebrity worlds, including Labour politicians David Miliband and Peter Mandelson and broadcasters Jeremy Clarkson, Jon Snow and Piers Morgan.

On that occasion, there was a room with a sommelier serving giant bottles of vintage claret.

One guest told me: ‘Matthew Freud is like a Great Gatsby figure, collecting people and things.’ In these straitened, we’re-all-in-this-together times, politicians might think twice before accepting an invitation to such a grandiloquent event. But few can resist the temptation to gawp at the opulence of Freud’s rural retreat.'

The plutocrat’s house contains a restored 17th-century chapel, alongside two pools — one with a horse’s head sculpture — a gym and a vast wine cellar.

Writer and socialite Jemima Khan, who has dated Hugh Grant and Russell Brand, had one of the lucky invites

In the garage, Freud keeps a 1963 white Jaguar convertible that he encourages guests to drive around the grounds. Freud himself claims to have reached a top speed of 140mph.

He is a voracious collector, and his office in the Oxfordshire house  is decorated with historical documents, including the Instrument of Abdication — the 1936 letter from King Edward VIII relinquishing the throne in order to marry Wallis Simpson.

One visitor to the family’s London home says a painting by the Russian-French artist Marc Chagall hangs in the hallway.

For his birthday last week, his wife is said to have bought him a present that might not be to everyone’s taste: a painting called P***ing At The Moon, by 17th-century Flemish artist Pieter Brueghel. It depicts a man in a coat urinating into a moonlit lake.

Networker Mr Freud took the 'survival of the fittest' theory literally - by inviting TV adventurer Bear Grylls

Such quirky humour does not come cheap: the last time the picture was offered at auction, in 2010, it sold for more than £361,000.

Freud’s taste in food is similarly extravagant. One recent lunch guest recalls their host, a keen cook, rustling up filet mignon, fettuccine with crab, leeks sautéed in crème fraîche, sautéed sausages in pastry, curried-chicken salad, roast potatoes and broccoli, all washed down with claret (a 1998 Pomerol).

Such attention to detail has  helped Freud to become a formidable networker.

The great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, Matthew’s father was the Liberal MP-turned-broadcaster Sir Clement Freud, his sister Emma is a broadcaster and wife of film director Richard Curtis, and his uncle was the renowned painter Lucian Freud.

He and Miss Murdoch, who have six children from three marriages, met in 1997.

Their marriage, in 2001, was a lavish affair at Blenheim Palace. They have since had two children together.

The pugnacious Freud is a formidable figure in the business world. Once, he threw a Martini in the face of an editor who criticised his wife, and smeared chocolate cake on the shirt of the actor Hugh Grant (a former client) during a row at a London nightclub three years ago. Grant allegedly responded by punching him in the face.

There may not have been any such unpleasantries last weekend at Freud’s 50th birthday party. Indeed, it seems to have been such a convivial night that there was confusion about whether the Prime Minister had dropped in and joined the festivities.
