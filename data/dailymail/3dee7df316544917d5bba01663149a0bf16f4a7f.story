PC David Woods is currently under investigation as part of a professional standards review over his business, Military Mart, which sells Nazi mugs

A police officer is under investigation over his lucrative sideline – selling guns, machetes and Nazi memorabilia.

PC David Woods is a director of the firm Military Mart, which sells lethal weaponry from an army surplus warehouse.

It boasts a wide variety of weapons, including replicas of AK-47s and Uzi sub-machines guns – all capable of firing air rifle ammunition – as well as bayonets and axes, mugs bearing the Nazi swastika and SS skull and a gas chamber sign, described as being ‘ideal for kids’ bedrooms’.

While it is not illegal to sell knives, machetes or air-powered imitation firearms to those over 18, police chiefs have mounted an investigation in the officer’s activities.

PC Woods, 34, has declared Military Mart, which claims it is one of the best stocked stores of its kind, as a business interest to his bosses at Merseyside Police. 

But they are now examining whether Woods’ business meets policing standards as some officers complain his activities are an ‘embarrassment’ to the force.

A senior source said: ‘Machetes, long-bladed knives and replica guns are all regularly used in committing crime, so he could effectively be arming the criminal fraternity.

‘Selling Nazi memorabilia is completely abhorrent in a serving police officer. This is a major embarrassment to the force and senior officers will want to put an end to it.’

Woods was based within the force’s Matrix unit – the specialist unit set up to tackle gun and knife crime on Merseyside – before being moved out after ‘serious concerns’ over his integrity arose.

Since 2011, he has continued to be employed under a Service Confidence Plan - which means he is monitored under a scheme to ‘restore confidence’ in officers whose integrity is called into question when serious concerns arise but criminal or misconduct proceedings are not possible.

He carries out front-line police duties in Knowsley, in Merseyside, including executing drug warrants and tackling organised gangs.

Companies House lists Mr Woods, his brother Paul Woods and his 18-year-old nephew Andrew Woods as co-directors of Military Mart, which operates from a warehouse in Ormskirk, Lancashire.

Merseyside Police says it will now investigate whether ‘a serving police officer has registered a business interest that may not be appropriate’.

A force spokesman said: ‘All declared registered business interests are considered on a case-by-case basis by management and either approved or declined. 

Military Mart is selling a 'Nazi Eagle Mug' for £3.99 which is describes is 'popular among rifle enthusiasts'

'This matter has now been referred to the force’s Professional Standards Department and this particular business interest is to be reviewed.’

Cllr Simon Shaw, of Merseyside’s Police and Crime Panel, said: ‘Although I understand that this business interest was declared, was the nature of some of the items reportedly on sale made clear?

‘Maintaining full public confidence in the police is obviously vital, and that is why outside business interests have to be declared and sometimes can be a problem.’

PC Woods and Military Mart refused to comment.

The online store is also selling a t-shirt with slogan 'Uzi does it' and a Nazi skull mug stating 'Since 1933'

The shop stocks 20 different kind of air rifles, including this replica Uzi. Some of the guns retail for £175

A set of three throwing knives are available from the shop co-directed by PC David Woods, who formerly worked for Merseyside Police's anti-gun crime Matrix unit

An axe like this one is one of the many weapons on sale. Woods has registered Military Mart as a business interest to his bosses at Merseyside Police and the matter is currently being investigated
