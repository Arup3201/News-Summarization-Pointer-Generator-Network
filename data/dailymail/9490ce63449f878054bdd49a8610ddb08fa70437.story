Scientists say they have found a potential cure for motor neurone disease, which could be in clinical trials as early as next year, it was revealed today.

Researchers from the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience hope that their ground-breaking research could lead to a cure for one of the forms of the disease, which affects more than 5,000 people in the UK, including Professor Stephen Hawking.

It is also hoped that the research will help develop a way of screening people with a family history of the condition and fixing any faulty gene before symptoms begin.

Professor Mimoun Azzouz, leading Gene Therapy Scientist and Chair of Translational Neuroscience, said: 'Quite simply this is a devastating disease, patients suffering from motor neurone disease can die within one or two years in the most severe cases, and lose all ability to use muscles, including arms and legs.

'It can prevent them from having a normal life and there is no treatment at all for this.

'Some of the cases are genetic, caused by a faulty gene called called SOD1. We are devising a strategy to take out the faulty gene.

'The breakthrough, if this a success, will be huge because there is no treatment for this syndrome. Because it is genetic, if patients can be screened for the gene, because of family history, then we can intervene even before the symptoms appear and rescue them. It can be a cure.'

The professor added that he hoped the treatment would begin clinical trials by 2015.

He added: 'We plan submission for regulatory approval by August 2015, for permission to take this therapy to patients in the clinic.

It will be in clinics as a clinical trial at first, then if that is a success we would look to make it available for patients after that.'

Until now, all available treatments and drug-trials conducted across the world have failed to effectively halt the progression of the condition.

Riluzole, the only drug that has demonstrated a survival benefit, prolongs life for just three to six months and may not be effective in all patients.

But Prof Azzouz said he was confident that this research would be a success.

He explained: 'Because we are targeting the causative gene, based on the previous studies that we have done, there's a very good chance that this can be a success.

'We are in an advanced programme looking at MND in childhood and in babies, and it's cause is not because of a faulty gene but it is in fact totally absent. In our programme we are using a virus carrier to attempt to restore the gene back.

'For example, in a mouse model the mice that had the disease would survive two weeks maximum from birth. But when we treated these mice we seen that they survived for nearly 400 days, so you can see the strength of this strategy.'
