A family of four had a lucky escape last night after a car ploughed into their home, demolishing the front door and ending up in the hallway.

The car's male driver, in his late 40s, also walked away uninjured from his £80,000 blue Audi S-line saloon following the accident yesterday at around 6.45pm in Earlsdon, Coventry.

However, his female passenger aged 41 had to be freed from the wreck by firefighters before being taken to hospital with neck, pelvic and leg injuries.

The family of two adults and two children were ‘extremely fortunate’ not to have been injured, according to medics, after the car also partially demolished the staircase of the £500,000 property.

The black and white-render detached home was left with a 10ft hole where the front door used to be.

Firefighters from West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service's technical rescue unit towed the car out of the house and then worked to shore up the front of the building using wooden joists.

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘Crews arrived to find a car embedded three quarters of the way into the hallway area of a house.

‘The woman passenger in the car, believed to be 41 years old, suffered neck, pelvic and leg injuries and was treated whilst still in the vehicle.

'Considering the damage to the house the two adults, two children and dog inside at the time of the crash were extremely fortunate not to have been injured'

‘The man driving the car, believed to be in his late 40s, was uninjured in the crash.’

The spokesman added: ‘Considering the damage to the house the two adults, two children and dog inside at the time of the crash were extremely fortunate not to have been injured.’

A spokesman for West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘Firefighters attended a road traffic collision in Earlsdon Avenue South, with reports of one car into a house. All persons were accounted for - the house and vehicle were made safe.’

Fire crew commander Glenn Mallabone, from
 Coventry Blue Watch, added: ‘The car had gone straight through the 
entrance and took all the entrance out and brought the stairs down.

‘It just missed the living room and ended up breaking in to the kitchen area. It's a big old detached house, I would estimate a 1920s build and I would imagine that helped it a bit.

'It just missed the living room and ended up breaking in to the kitchen area. The family were in the front room watching the television and they were trapped because the car was across their exit'

Glenn Mallabone, West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service

‘The family were in the front room watching the television and they were trapped because the car was across their exit.

‘The house is right opposite a junction so I think they car had come up the road and just not stopped. It's literally gone on the drive, up the drive and straight through the front door. The only thing it hasn't done is ring the doorbell.’

Fire crews also turned off the house's gas and electricity supplies as a precaution. The circumstances of how the car came to end up crashing into the house are not yet known.

Five miles away on the other side of Coventry this morning, a man suffered serious injuries after the car he was in ended up crushed between a bus stop and metal railings.

The accident happened after the car came off a road in the Bell Green area of the city before crashing at about 5.30am today, according to West Midlands Ambulance Service.

Firefighters had to cut the top off the car to help medics treat the injured male, who was stabilised and taken to hospital for further treatment.
