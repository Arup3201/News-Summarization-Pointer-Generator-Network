Gaye Williams, who claimed thousands in illegal benefits to fund her middle-class lifestyle, was dressed smartly for court in a suit, hat and leather shoes and briefcase

A middle-class couple who lived in luxury and sent their son to a posh private school illegally claimed £11,500 in benefits to fund their lifestyle.

Mother Gaye Williams, 38, lied to the authorities about being a single parent in need of extra financial support to ensure she was eligible for council, housing and tax benefits.

In fact the estate agent enjoyed an affluent lifestyle with her engineer husband Glyn, 47, who was earning £1,500-a-week.

Their son attended a private school 
and the family owned two pedigree Dogues de Bordeaux dogs worth £1,000 
each, as well as two cars including a 4X4.

Gloucester
Crown Court heard yesterday how despite claiming to be a single parent,
Mrs Williams had the benefits paid into her husband’s bank account.

The
couple avoided jail after both pleading guilty; Mrs Williams to three 
charges of falsely obtaining benefits and Mr Williams to three offences 
of possessing criminal property.

The
pair have now been evicted from their home in Churcham, Gloucestershire
and while Mrs Williams is living off £130-a-week in benefits while Mr 
Williams’ earning have dropped to £500-a-week working for a tractor 
company.

The court heard 
that Gaye was the ‘brains’ behind the scam, while her husband was ‘very 
hard working with considerable earning ability’.

Judge Jamie Tabor told Mrs Williams: 
‘You are an intelligent woman and you decided to defraud the public, 
which was unnecessary. Members of the public would say it is a lot of 
money - and it is.'

As well as lying to the Department of 
Work and Pensions, Williams claimed housing and council tax benefit 
while living in Hempsted, Gloucester, between November 2008 and January 
2009, and similar benefits from Tewkesbury Borough Council while living 
in the village of Highnam between March and August 2009.

The total paid out by the three authorities was about £11,500.

Steve
Young, defending Mrs Williams, a former estate agent, said publicity of
the case had caused her distress and made it difficult for her to work.

He
added that the dogs had not been paid for with the benefits but that 
the couple’s son bought the pets with money he won at a horticultural 
fair.

But Judge Tabor told Mrs Williams it was unlikely publicity was the reason she could not find employment.

He said: ‘In fact it is because you committed serious offences.’

Judge
Jamie Tabor ordered Mrs Williams to do 180 hours unpaid work and Mr 
Williams to do 125 hours, telling them it was a ‘sad and sorry tale’.

Judge Tabor said: ‘I expect the Department of Work and Pensions will get the money back in the next two or three years.’

Sabiha Pathan, defending Mr Williams, 47, told the court he had been working hard towards repayment.

The benefit fraudsters avoided prison at Gloucester Crown Court and instead were sentenced to unpaid work

Judge Tabor told him: ‘Your wife is an intelligent woman and she knew what she was doing.

‘You knew what she was doing by letting her put the money in your bank account. You allowed it to happen.

‘I’m quite satisfied we will not see you here again. I know this has been agony for you.’

As well as unpaid work, Mr Williams was ordered to pay back £2,500.

He amassed more than £2,500 to pay back the fraudulent cash - but his wife was unable to return any money.
