Louis van Gaal has been charged by the FA for implying that referee Chris Foy was ‘against’ Manchester United when his team drew at Cambridge in the FA Cup last month. He has until 6pm on Monday to respond to the charge.

His comments followed a goalless draw at the Abbey Stadium when Van Gaal appeared to be unhappy with a number of issues and claimed that ‘every aspect of the match is against us’.

He added: ‘We have to come here, the pitch isn’t so good, the opponents always give a lot more than they normally give and defending is always easier than attacking and then you have seen the referee.

Van Gaal was left with plenty to ponder after his United side were held to a goalless draw last month

'It’s always the same. Everywhere I have coached these games — and I have coached them also with other clubs — it’s always the same.’

Asked to explain his implied criticism of Foy, Van Gaal added: ‘You can give your own opinion. I can’t give mine.’

The 52-year-old referee was not involved in any major controversies and the FA have accused Van Gaal of questioning Foy’s integrity.

An FA statement said: ‘It is alleged that the Manchester United manager’s comments allege and/or imply bias on the part of the match referee and/or bring the game into disrepute.’
