Researchers have revealed the surface of Mercury was once covered with a vast ocean of magma.

Scientists analysing data from a spacecraft orbiting the plan have been baffled by odd readings that showed unexplained chemical differences between rocks.

Now they say the differences may have been caused by a vast ocean of magma that created layers of crystals, which melted then erupted.

Messenger (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) is the first spacecraft 
ever to orbit the planet Mercury.

The spacecraft's seven scientific 
instruments and radio science investigation are unraveling the history 
and evolution of the planet closest to the Sun.

During its one-year 
primary mission, Messenger acquired 88,746 images.

It is now in an extended mission, during which plans 
call for the acquisition of more than 80,000 additional image.

Scientists at MIT have proposed that Mercury may have harbored a large, ocean of magma very early in its history, shortly after its formation about 4.5 billion years ago.

The scientists analyzed data gathered by Messenger, a NASA probe that has orbited the planet since March 2011.

Scientists analyzed X-ray fluorescence data from the probe, and identified two distinct compositions of rocks on the planet’s surface  -but were baffled by the differences.

The MIT team used the compositional data to recreate the two rock types in the lab, and subjected each synthetic rock to high temperatures and pressures to simulate various geological processes.

From their experiments, the scientists came up with only one phenomenon to explain the two compositions: a vast magma ocean that created two different layers of crystals, solidified, then eventually remelted into magma that then erupted onto Mercury’s surface.

'The thing that’s really amazing on 
Mercury is, this didn’t happen yesterday,' said Timothy Grove, a 
professor of geology at MIT.

'The crust is probably more than 4 billion years old, so this magma ocean is a really ancient feature.'

The team translated the chemical 
element ratios from the surface into the corresponding building blocks 
that make up rocks, such as magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide and 
aluminum oxide.

The researchers then consulted what Grove refers to as a
'pantry of oxides' — finely powdered chemicals — to recreate the rocks 
in the lab.

'We just mix these together in the 
right proportions and we’ve got a synthetic copy of what’s on the 
surface of Mercury,' Grove says.

The researchers then melted the 
samples of synthetic rock in a furnace, cranking the heat up and down to
simulate geological processes that would cause crystals — and 
eventually rocks — to form in the melt.

'You can tell what would happen as the melt cools and crystals form and change the chemical composition of the remaining melted rock,' Grove says.

'The leftover melt changes composition.' 

After cooling the samples, the researchers picked out tiny crystals and melt pockets for analysis. Grove found the two compositions were
too different to have originated from the same region, and instead may 
have come from two separate regions within the planet.

The easiest explanation for what 
created these distinct regions, Grove says, is a large magma ocean, 
which over time likely formed different compositions of crystals as it 
solidified.

This molten ocean eventually remelted, spewing lava onto the surface of the planet in massive volcanic eruptions.

The images reveal giant craters on the surface of Mercury seen in unprecedented detail. This basin's outer rim is about 306 km in diameter and the inner (peak) ring is about 140 km in diameter

Grove estimates that this magma ocean likely existed very early in Mercury’s existence — possibly within the first 1 million to 10 million years — and may have been created from the violent processes that formed the planet.

As the solar nebula condensed, bits and pieces collided into larger chunks to form tiny, and then larger, planets.

That process of colliding and accreting may produce enough energy to completely melt the planet — a scenario that would make an early magma ocean very feasible. 'The acquisition of data by spacecraft must be combined with laboratory experiments,' Charlier says.

'Although these data are valuable by themselves, experimental studies on these compositions enable scientists to reach the next level in the interpretation of planetary evolution.'
