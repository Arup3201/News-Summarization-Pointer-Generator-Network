The first police investigation into the death of an elderly hospital patient under the discredited Liverpool Care Pathway has begun, a police force revealed yesterday.

The inquiry follows the death of 85-year-old Alice Johnson on a hospital ward in June – less than a month before the deadline set by ministers for the NHS to cease using the pathway.

Mrs Johnson was sent to hospital for assessment after staff at her care home suspected the onset of dementia.

The Liverpool Care Pathway was supposed to ensure dignified and pain-free dying but it was scrapped after a scathing independent inquiry last year found it had meant ‘uncaring, rushed and ignorant’ treatment of the most vulnerable patients.

The inquiry headed by Baroness Neuberger unearthed ‘desperate stories of desperate people’ who had been denied water on hospital wards after they had been assumed to be dying.

Ministers branded the system ‘a national disgrace’ and ordered it to be stopped by July 14, 2014.

However, medical records released to Mrs Johnson’s daughter Angela show her mother was placed on the pathway in Warrington General Hospital on June 26 this year, the same day that health minister Norman Lamb announced new rules on care for the dying and promised patients that in future ‘their voices, and those of their families, will be heard at all times’. Mrs Johnson died on June 29.

Miss Johnson said yesterday she had not been told her mother had been placed on the pathway and only found out when she asked for the records after her death.

Mrs Johnson is officially said to have died from urinary tract infection and dementia. Her daughter said: ‘When I saw her dead in bed, she looked like a mummy, she was all dried up.

‘I had an awful feeling she had been killed. I said to the hospital staff, “You have killed her because you haven’t given her any water”. I kept saying don’t over-sedate her, and don’t take her drip off, but nobody listened.’

Mrs Johnson, who had been in a care home in Wigan, was admitted to Hollins Park Hospital in Warrington for a mental health assessment in April. While there she was put under sedation. On June 12, she was transferred to Warrington General.

Miss Johnson said that staff there said her mother had ‘end-stage dementia’. When Miss Johnson complained about her mother’s hydration she said a doctor told her hydration was ‘only delaying the inevitable’.

Key features of the pathway – said to have been used at its peak for more than 130,000 hospital deaths a year – were sedation followed by removal of artificial hydration.

Critics said that on average death occurred 33 hours later. As reported in the Mail, experts were calling for the LCP to be banned back in 2009.

Miss Johnson has complained to Cheshire police. 

A spokesman for Cheshire Constabulary said: ‘Two officers visited Angela Johnson to discuss her concerns, and were provided with medical and care records. Those records will now be examined to determine whether there are any grounds for a criminal investigation.’

Warrington General is part of Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The trust has made no comment on Mrs Johnson’s death or her daughter’s complaint.

Hollins Park is part of the 5 Boroughs Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. The trust said there was no evidence Mrs Johnson was placed on the pathway during her stay at Hollins Park.
