A married mother allegedly posted sexually explicit photos and videos of her doctor after they ended their affair, it has emerged.

Dolly Beattie, from Amelia, Ohio, claims that before she shared the intimate images on Facebook and YouTube, Terrence McCoy had told her colleagues information about her that got her fired.

Now the spat is playing out in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court as Beattie, 48, sues McCoy, 51, - accusing him of taking advantage of his doctor status during their affair - while McCoy has filed his own protective order against her.

In court documents, McCoy, who is also married, admits he was Beattie's doctor when they started an affair in September 2011 and he sent her suggestive videos and texts, Cincinnati.com reported.

Court battle: Dolly Beattie allegedly posted explicit images of her doctor online following their affair

Beattie ended the affair and reported him to the State Medical Board of Ohio for having sex with a patient.

She later dismissed it but the medical board continued to investigate before McCoy agreed to have his medical license permanently revoked in 2012.

Beattie had similar troubles at work after the affair; she was fired shortly after from her job at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.

She claimed that the jilted McCoy had called doctors and other hospital employees and gave them information that led to her losing her job.

McCoy has admited in court documents that he called employees but said he did not tell them about their affair or have a part in her being fired.

After she was fired, Beattie admits 
that, on June 2, 2013, she posted graphic videos and photos the doctor 
had sent her to Facebook and YouTube.

'She snapped,' Beattie's attorney Mary Jill Donovan explained. 'She was so overwrought about what a dope she'd been and how he'd treated her.'

Beattie quickly removed the posts but the doctor learned about them anyway.

McCoy sued her, claiming that even though he had sent her the videos and photos, she violated his privacy by sharing them online.

Lawyer Jon Garon, director of the Northern Kentucky University Law + Informatics Institute, told Cincinnati.com that he expects to see more and more cases of this type.

'The reason for its increase is convenience,' he said. 'The camera has become part of the bedroom.'

The case returns to court December 17.
