She's no stranger to being handed awards for being sexy - she has won the Sexiest Soap Star five years on the trot and recently came second only to Jennifer Lawrence in the hotly contested FHM Sexiest Women awards.

And now, Michelle Keegan has topped yet another poll, this time for possessing the best beach body.

The former Coronation Street star beat off stiff competition from the likes of Rihanna, Kelly Brook, Kim Kardashian and Lucy Mecklenburgh to take the top spot.

Winning...again! Michelle Keegan is no stranger to topping polls and now she's been hailed as having the best celebrity bikini body of 2014

The Weatherfield girl, 27, won with 39 per cent of the female vote in the poll, with Rihanna coming second with 15 per cent.

When asked which female celebrity has the best beach body, men voted in much the same way as women, with Michelle Keegan polling 38 per cent of the votes and Kelly Brook and Kate Upton coming joint second with 19 per cent each.

The survey
 also asked the women of the UK which celebrity had the most enviable 
stomach, legs, arms, boobs and bum, with Michelle Keegan again topping 
all categories - except best bum, won by Rihanna.

Coming
 second in the category was - you guessed it - Kim Kardashian, followed 
by Kelly Brook and Khloe Kardashian, with Michelle Keegan coming joint 
fifth alongside Lucy Mecklenburgh and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

The
 survey also assessed women's views on the ultimate beach body and how 
they aspire to achieve it - according to results, 64 per cent of the 
women questioned will prepare for a holiday by eating healthily, while 
49 per cent will also work out 2-3 times a week.

Almost 8 per cent won't
 change anything before a beach holiday, found the survey by Fit 
Britches shapewear.

Making up the top five: Kelly Brook, left, and Lucy Mecklenburgh, right, who found fame on TOWIE, came in third and fourth place respectively

The average woman spends nearly £14,000 on beauty summer preparations in their lifetime, reveals a new study.

Researchers found a flurry of panic sets in at the thought of looking good in the sunshine season, leading to girls shelling out on fake tan treatments, pedicures, and waxing their way to body confidence.

With the average woman shelling out £235 a year, this amounts to £13,865 between the ages of 18-75 spent on looking good for the summer.

The study of 2,000 women found the preparation takes at least four gruelling weeks for the average woman who has at least seven urgent things she wants to do to prepare herself for the warmer months.

Exfoliating rough skin, waxing, moisturising, buying make-up with SPF protection and new shoes all featured on the top 20 summer to-do list.

Ensuring feet are flip-flop ready was also top priority on the summer to-do list, with de-fuzzing of legs ranking highly amid a new wardrobe being purchased for the summer season.

The research, which was commissioned by Scholl and Veet as they announce their collaboration with Abbey Clancy looked at British women’s body confidence ahead of summer and found ladies take great pride in their eyes, hair and boobs.

No wonder she's proud of them! Abbey Clancy 
reveals that her legs are her best asset as she showcases them in her 
new Scholl and Veet campaign
