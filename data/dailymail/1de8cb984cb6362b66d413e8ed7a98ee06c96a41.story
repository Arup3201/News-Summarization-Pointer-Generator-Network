Decked out in multiple shades of pink with one-off accessories galore and a catwalk leading to a full-length mirror, Barbie's dream hotel room is now a permanent fixture at the Hilton Buenos Aires.

Fans of the world's most popular fashion doll can spend the night in a room based on Barbie's Dreamhouse, the first of its kind in the world, for £112 (US$179 per night), with the price rising as high as £356 ($569) in peak periods. 

The hotel has marked 10 years since it first collaborated with toymaker Mattel to created the Barbie-est room in the world by making it available year-round.

The marble bathroom is just like a doll's house, with the addition of customised toiletries

Re-opening in September it's proving hugely popular and is fully booked until the start of 2015.

The room, number 136 at the hotel, has a 32-inch television running non-stop Barbie films, a marble bathroom, a walk-in wardrobe and, of course, a host of Barbie dolls and related toys to play with. 

The experience begins in the lobby where a giant pink heel marks the presence of the room, before those staying there go through their own children's check-in area before being ushered VIP-style up a dedicated staircase to the room.

In what may be the most impressive feature for the parents, they can also book a normal adjoining room with a connecting door.
