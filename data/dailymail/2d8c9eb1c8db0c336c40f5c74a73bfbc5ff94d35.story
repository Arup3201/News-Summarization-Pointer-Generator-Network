The NFL returns with a bang this Thursday as the Green Bay Packers head west to take on the reigning Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. The Packers will be looking to avenge the infamous ‘Fail Mary’ defeat in 2012, during which the replacement refs awarded the Seahawks a controversial game-winning touchdown late in the fourth quarter.

The task is a formidable one for Aaron Rodgers and Co. The Seahawks boast an impressive home record, that's seen them taste defeat just once over the last two seasons at Century Link Field.

However, the Packers head to the North West with both quarterback Rodgers and linebacker Clay Matthews fully fit following their injury struggles last season. The return of the pair, who are looked upon as the cornerstones of this Packers team, will no doubt boost Green Bay they look to improve on their 10-6 record over the Seahawks.

Up first: The Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks will begin the season against the Green Bay Packers

Unlike many previous Super Bowl champions that have fallen victim to the rigours of free agency and the cap, the Seahawks have retained the vast majority of their stars. Defensive stars Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas penned new deals during the off-season and both will look to continue the formidable legacy of the 'legion of boom'.

But it's not all been golden handshakes and smiles in Seattle, with running back Marshawn Lynch holding out for a few days. Coach Pete Carroll’s strength in depth has also been affected with Chris Clemons, Red Bryant and Clinton McDonald moving on.

Russell Wilson has been nothing short of outstanding in pre-season and you can be certain that the Seahawks will be opening up the playbook more than we've been used to seeing.

Battle: Seattle receiver Golden Tate and Green Bay's MD Jennings both fought over the same ball

Percy Harvin missed the vast majority of his debut season with the team, but with a full pre-season schedule behind him, the former Vikings receiver is set to torment opposition defences with his combination of speed and playmaking ability. Opposite Harvin, Jermaine Kearse has also been a standout during the summer months and should fill the void left by Golden Tate.

But the Packers also boast an impressive receiving duo in Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson, who combined for 1747 yards and 12 touchdowns last term, and let’s not forget that their work was complimented by Jarrett Boykin, who contributed 681 yards and three touchdowns. As impressive as the statistics read, the Packers would be forgiven for straying away from the obvious threat thought the air, especially against a passing defense that was ranked No 1 overall, in favour of a punishing ground game. Eddie Lacy carried the team during Rodgers’ absence, amassing 1178 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns at 4.1 yards per carry last season. Lacy has the skills to take advantage of a Seahawks running defense that surrendered an average of 101.6 yards per game.

Raring to go: Aaron Rodgers is back for Green Bay after missing a large part of last season through injury

Defensively, the Packers have somewhat addressed concerns within the secondary by re-signing cornerback Sam Shields, who performed at a consistently high level throughout last season. Along with Shields the Packers added first-round draft pick Ha-Ha Clinton Dix, who may be used in rotation to begin with, but if the college tape holds up, it'll be sooner rather than later before he becomes the starting safety.

The question still remains for Packers fans - can this team stay healthy for the long haul, and recover from their recent play-off heartbreak?

And for the ‘12th man’ in Seattle, is this the beginning of a dynasty? Can Carroll’s charge repeat their success from last season. It’s a tough ask - no team has successfully defended the Super Bowl since the New England Patriots in 2004 and 2005.
