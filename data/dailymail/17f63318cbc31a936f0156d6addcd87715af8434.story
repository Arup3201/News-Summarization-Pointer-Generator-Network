Raheem Sterling is ready to play for England Under 21s in next summer's European Championship.

And the Liverpool wonderkid could be joined by Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who's confirmed he is open to being included in Gareth Southgate's squad for the tournament in the Czech Republic.

Sterling's decision to inform senior manager Roy Hodgson that he was suffering of leg weariness ahead of last Sunday's clash in Estonia has divided opinion this week - with some even questioning the youngster's commitment to England.

But Sportsmail understands Sterling, provided an agreement between Liverpool and the FA is reached, will show he is fully committed to England by sacrificing his summer break should Southgate select the Liverpool star.

Sterling feels the prospect of tournament football can aid his football development.

Southgate's men booked their place in the tournament, which kicks off on June 17, with a play-off win over Croatia earlier this week.

Sportsmail has led calls for Southgate to pick the strongest possible squad available to him, meaning a number of players who have established themselves in England's senior set-up taking a step down to Under 21 level for the tournament.

The likes of Chamberlain, Sterling, Jack Wilshere, Phil Jones all qualify for the Under 21s - as do Ross Barkley, Calum Chambers, John Stones and Luke Shaw, who all have full international caps.

Sterling has been in superb form for Liverpool this season, scoring three times already

Chamberlain has become the first to publicly reveal he will play for the Under 21s this summer, if asked.

Speaking ahead of his appearance on The Clare Balding Show on BT Sport 1 on Thursday night, the Arsenal star said: 'Would I play for the Under 21s this summer if asked? Yes, you’d never turn your nose up at something like that.

'But there’s a lot that goes into that because the national team have two games around the same time as the tournament.

'So it’s up to Roy Hodgson to decide if he wants. There’s a lot of players in the England squad at the moment that could drop back down and play for the Under 21s so it’s up to the manager to decide.

'I don’t know the dates. When that time comes around I’ll have to think about it. Gareth might not even want me.

'It’s a discussion that will be had closer to the time with the England manager, someone at Arsenal and Gareth Southgate.'

Gareth Southgate could have as many as eight extra players available to select for the Under 21 European Championships next year:

Raheem Sterling, Liverpool

Jack Wilshere, Arsenal

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal

Calum Chambers, Arsenal

Luke Shaw, Manchester United

Phil Jones, Manchester United 

John Stones, Everton

Ross Barkley, Everton 

The clamour for England's eligible senior players to feature in the next year's tournament was reinforced by Nigel Pearson and Stuart Pearce - who have both worked for the Under 21s - on Thursday.

Nottingham Forest manager Pearce, a former Under 21 boss, said: 'If you want a successful international side, you’re going to have to make sure your best players go to tournaments, which I’ve said time and time again.

'I'm not going to change my tune now. The bottom line is our best players should be going to a major tournament if they’re age appropriate and available in my opinion and that doesn’t change.'

Leicester boss Pearson, who worked as Pearce's assistant in the Under 21 set-up in 2007, added: 'I don't think there is a debate. We have it completely the wrong way round. The question that needs to be asked is whether the Football Association invokes the rule it could do.

'Every other federation does it but unfortunately this country we seem reluctant. That stems from the fact the FA don't have the clout other federations have. Clubs basically run football in this country.

'They can call them up, every other country does. I'm stating what the facts are. I've worked for the FA and it's very frustrating when you can't get your best players.'

The prospect of established senior international's playing for the Under 21s next summer will not please everyone, though.

Managers will be eager for their young stars, especially those who were part of the World Cup squad earlier this year, to have maximum time off ahead of next season.

It is likely any decision that will see full internationals take a step back to Under 21s will only come after lengthy discussions with clubs.

But Arsene Wenger (above) has said publicly he is not happy with the idea of them playing next summer

And Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who could see three of his senior players named in Southgate's squad, says he would prefer for Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wilshere and Chambers to miss the tournament.

'You know my thinking on this, once a guy has moved up to the full national team, you put him down (again to the Under 21s) he is never good,' insisted Wenger.

'Apart from on the selfish front for us, when a guy has played 50 games, it is better a guy has a good rest during the summer.

'But most of the time, when they move down, they are not completely at their quality.'
