Broadcasters scrambled to rescue their plan for election debates tonight after being accused of trying to 'call David Cameron's bluff' with an extraordinary plan to include a total of seven party leaders thrashing it out on TV.

The Prime Minister had rejected a proposal which would have involved one of three debates putting him up against Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem's Nick Clegg because it would have included Ukip's Nigel Farage. The PM said the Greens should have a slot.

Under the new plan, Green leader Natalie Bennett would also be joined by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. 

But the plan immediately sparked complains from George Galloway's Respect party and Cornish Nationalists Mebyon Kernow. 

Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said the plans appeared 'designed to call David Cameron's bluff'.

The debates form a traditional part of US Presidential elections, but critics say they risked sucking the life out of the wider campaign.

With the polls showing the election is widen open, with the rise of minor parties threatening to rob both Labour and the Tories of any hope of a majority, more have demanded a place in any televised showdown.

In October the main broadcasters set out plans for three debates, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage offered a slot in one contest for the first time.

Under the plans, Channel 4 and Sky News would host a debate between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron, hosted by Jeremy Paxman.

The BBC is planning to host a debate, chaired by David Dimbleby, between Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg – a repeat of the three-way format seen in 2010.

ITV would host the four-way debate, including Mr Farage for the first time, chaired by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham.

But Mr Cameron ruled out taking part unless the Green leader Natalie Bennett was included. 

Now fresh proposals have emerged which would see the BBC and ITV staging debates involving the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens, Ukip, the Scottish National Party and Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru.

The third debate would remain a head to head between the Tory and Labour leaders, shown on Sky and Channel 4, it was reported. 

Asked if the 7-7-2 format would secure Mr Cameron's participation, a Conservative source said: 'Further discussions are planned and we will obviously look at any new proposals presented by broadcasters.'

The Tories pushed for the debates to happen in 2010, when Mr Clegg was seen to have have triumphed over Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown

In a joint statement, the broadcasters said they 'remain committed to providing election debates in the run-up to the general election'.

'The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015.' 

Ms Bennett - whose party organised a petition which attracted more than 280,000 signatures in favour of the party's inclusion - welcomed the news.

'Thank you to everyone who campaigned,' she wrote on Twitter.'We haven't yet had official notification but it looks like you succeeded.'

SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: 'If it is true that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be included in UK-wide debates under the broadcasters' new proposals, it represents very welcome progress.

'With a larger membership than the Lib Dems and Ukip combined, and more elected MPs than Ukip, the case for including the SNP in the televised debates is unanswerable.'

With the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens all led by women, he said, it would 'rightly show that politics beyond Westminster isn't just an old boys' club'.

Plaid leader Leanne Wood said: 'We have always maintained that it is an important democratic principle that people in this election should be presented with a clear picture of the choice that they face on polling day.

'This is a significant victory for the vast number of people who have campaigned for the inclusion of the anti-austerity parties in these debates.

'I look forward to taking part and making the case for Wales to have as strong a voice as possible in Westminster.'

But parties that remained outside the wider debate proposals demanded inclusion.

Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Peter Robinson said he would be writing to the BBC and ITV demanding an explanation for the exclusion of his party - pointing out that with eight MPs, it had a larger Commons presence than the SNP (6), Plaid (3) or the Greens (1).

George Galloway - the former Labour MP who now is the sole representative of the Respect Party in the Commons - posted on Twitter: 'Oi - what about me?'

Mebyon Kernow's Dick Cole demanded better coverage for Cornish nationalism. He said: 'I welcome the fact that MK’s sister parties in Wales and Scotland could be included and it shows that the nature of politics is certainly changing across the UK.

'But as the Leader of Mebyon Kernow, the big questions for me are: Will these same broadcasters also guarantee fair and equal access to the media for MK during the election? And unlike in previous elections, will they allow MK its own Party Election Broadcastnd, And also unlike previous elections, equal coverage on media that broadcasts in Cornwall?

'I will be making representations to the BBC and Ofcom later tonight.' 

The latest YouGov poll shows how Ukip and the Greens have made big gains, while Labour and the Tories have struggled to get above 35 per cent

BBC director general Tony Hall told Radio Times it made 'absolute sense to have the involvement of the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Greens and Ukip'.

'This time round the debates are going to be more important to democracy than last time round.

'I don't know anyone who can call this election, therefore the notion of hearing those who are competing for your vote being tested and testing one another, is much more important than last time round.'

A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 'We have only just received these new proposals.

'We have always been clear that as a party of government, we must be able to defend our record in all the TV debates.

'We will continue to make that case in our discussions with the broadcasters.'
