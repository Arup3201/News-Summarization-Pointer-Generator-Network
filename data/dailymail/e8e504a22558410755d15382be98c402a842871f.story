The Georgia man who gunned down his lover's husband outside a preschool as he dropped off his son was today found guilty but declared mentally ill - meaning he will be treated in a mental hospital in prison.

Hemy Neuman was charged with murder in the death of Russell Sneiderman. Prosecutors and defense attorneys said the shooting was linked to an affair Sneiderman's wife was having with Neuman, though she denied those allegations.

He will be sentenced later on Thursday and faces up to life in prison.

Neuman, a Georgia Tech graduate and father-of-three, was a high-ranking manager at General Electric, where he supervised Mr Sneiderman's wife Andrea.

He was arrested about six weeks after
the killing when prosecutors discovered he rented a silver minivan seen
speeding away from the shooting on the morning of November 18, 2010.

The trial garnered attention because 
the slaying was brazen, Neuman and Sneiderman had impressive 
professional backgrounds and because of the questions surrounding Andrea
Sneiderman, who was accused of goading Neuman into the killing by both 
prosecutors and defense attorneys.

She denied knowing anything about the killing and has not been charged.

Neuman also told mental health examiners he 
was visited by a demon whose voice sounded like Barry White and an angel
who looked like Olivia Newton-John. The angel ordered him to fatally 
shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview.

Prosecutors called the shooting a calculated killing by a jealous man who wanted what he couldn't have.

Neuman's attorneys argued he could not tell the difference between right and wrong when he killed Sneiderman.

He pleaded not guilty by reason of 
insanity. If the jury had reached that verdict, Neuman would have become
a ward of the state mental health department and a judge would have 
later decided when, if ever, he could be released.

Experts on both sides of the case disagreed over whether Neuman was insane during the shooting.

Russell Sneiderman, a 
Harvard-educated entrepreneur, was killed shortly after he dropped off 
the couple's two-year-old son at a daycare in Dunwoody, a wealthy suburb
north of Atlanta.

Police said a bearded man in a hoodie
resembling Neuman fired four shots at the 36-year-old and sped away, 
blending in with rush hour traffic.

Neuman's lawyers said during the 
month-long trial he fell so hopelessly in love with Andrea Sneiderman 
that he believed he was the father of her two children and that the only
way to protect them was to kill her husband.

Defense attorney Doug Peters called 
her a tease and an adulterer who took advantage of Neuman's 
deteriorating mental condition to get her husband's $2 million life 
insurance policy.

'The gun in this case was in Hemy's 
hand,' Peters said. 'But the trigger, I respectfully suggest, was pulled
by Andrea Sneiderman.'

Prosecutors also had few kind words for the widow.

DeKalb County District Attorney 
Robert James suggested in his closing arguments that she was Neuman's 
co-conspirator and that the two were covering up for each other.

But he said her possible influence on Neuman shouldn't take away from the crime that he committed.

'This was not because of some made 
up, some contrived, some constructed mental defect. It's simple,' James 
said. 'Hemy Neuman killed Rusty Sneiderman because he wanted his wife, 
he wanted his money, he wanted his life. Period.'

Ms Sneiderman repeatedly denied allegations she was having an affair with Neuman.

She testified that Neuman weaseled 
his way into her life and attacked her husband after she refused many 
advances, and that she didn't air her suspicions that Neuman killed her 
husband because it sounded unbelievable.

Denial: Andrea Sneiderman says her husband's killer was merely a 'family friend'

'Seems kind of ridiculous, right?' 
she said. 'The theory that my boss could kill my husband, it seemed kind
of stupid at the time.'

Days after she testified for 
prosecutors, she was barred from the courtroom for being disruptive and 
improperly engaging a witness despite being told not to do so.

Andrea Sneiderman was hired in early 
2010, and she and Neuman hit it off, exchanging 1,500 phone calls and 
text messages in the months leading up to the killing.

On work trips, they would share long dinners and intimate moments, including sex, according to attorneys.

Neuman didn't testify, but jurors 
heard him through hours of video recordings of interviews with 
investigators and mental health experts.

In one interview, Neuman was asked if he thinks he's the biological father of Sneiderman's two children.

'I don't know. I don't know. I don't 
know,' he said. 'I feel like these are my children. I feel like I need 
to be there for them. I feel like I need to raise them and I need to 
protect them. But I don't know.'

Neuman's attorneys tried to portray 
their client as a brilliant but troubled child who was constantly in 
fear of his father, a Holocaust survivor wracked with guilt because he 
was able to escape the death chambers at Auschwitz while many relatives 
died.

Born in Mexico, Neuman was sent to a 
boarding school in Israel and still suffers from fear of being 
abandoned, his attorneys said.

He later landed the GE job that allowed him to buy a pricey home in an upscale Atlanta suburb.

Neuman first tried to kill his rival 
in November 10, 2010, when he camped outside the Sneiderman house with a
gun he recently purchased and waited to attack, prosecutors said.

But he bolted after Russell Sneiderman noticed an intruder on his property and called police.

Eight days later, prosecutors said, 
Neuman arrived at his office much earlier than usual — at 5:36am — then 
sneaked out a back door to avoid security cameras and to give himself an
alibi.

Days later, Neuman went to Russell 
Sneiderman's funeral and even visited Andrea Sneiderman's house for a 
Jewish mourning ceremony, prosecutors said.
