Princess Beatrice today visited the young inpatients at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh (RHSC), her first official duty since becoming the official Royal Patron of The Sick Kids Friends Foundation in July.

The eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, 25, met with trustees of the charity which supports the hospital, as well as with patients, parents and staff at the RHSC.

The Royal visitor was greeted by the 
Foundation’s Board of trustees’ chairman, David Reith, at the hospital’s
 Drop-In Centre, a unique service for a Scottish children’s hospital, where she learned about the foundation's work supporting families and purchasing equipment for the hospital wards.

The hospital was opened more than 150 years ago by her namesake, Princess Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria

She
 was then accompanied to the hospital - which was opened more than 150 years ago by her namesake, Princess Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria - to visit the theatre where SKFF 
funded innovative keyhole surgery equipment.

On various wards she 
met with staff and patients who have benefited from equipment, 
facilities services and support provided by SKFF funding.

Beatrice was appointed patron in July, following in the footsteps of her great-grandmother the Queen Mother, who held the same role from 1992 until her death in 2002.

As well as receiving flowers from Rebecca Cullen, six, Beatrice met with staff and patients who have benefited from equipment, facilities services and support provided by SKFF funding

Frank
 Cusack, whose son Adam was treated at the hospital, was one of the 
people who met Princess Beatrice. Adam contracted an extremely rare form
 of haemophilus influenza - a bacterial infection - and ended up in a 
coma for two weeks. Staff at the RHSC treated him for meningitis and septicemia.

Frank 
said: 'During Adam’s time in hospital, the SKFF cared for me and my 
family by providing tremendous emotional, mental and physical support.

'While it was the hospital's team that saved my son's life, it was SKFF 
that saved my family, and without their support I'm not sure how we 
would have coped.

'Being
 able to meet the charity's Royal patron was amazing and I am so 
grateful to have been invited along for this special day.

'I look forward
 to hearing about Princess Beatrice's work with the charity and finding 
out how her help has benefited the hospital.'

Little Sophie Curran then presented Princess Beatrice with a posy of flowers to thank her for visiting the hospital.

David Reith, chairman of the Sick Kids Friends Foundation¿s Board of Trustees, said: 'We were delighted to welcome our new Royal patron Princess Beatrice to the Drop-In Centre and hospital'

Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, who was Patron from the charity’s 
foundation in 1992 until her death in 2002.

The Princess already has a 
close connection to the hospital and, as a child, she painted a picture 
which was sold at the inaugural Postcards for Sick Kids exhibition in 
1998.

Dorothy Hanley, Chief Nurse, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, NHS Lothian said:

'We
 are pleased to welcome HRH Princess Beatrice to the Royal Hospital for 
Sick Children during her visit to the Sick Kids Friends Foundation.

'The
 Sick Kids Friends Foundation provides much appreciated support to the 
patients, families and staff at the hospital.

'Funds raised by the 
charity help us to provide world class care and make time spent in 
hospital better for the children and their families.

'This
 is a lovely opportunity to show the Princess the great partnership 
between the hospital and the Sick Kids Friends Foundation, and the 
result of the outstanding fundraising which the charity and its 
supporters carry out for us each year.'

This is a lovely opportunity to show the Princess the great partnership between the hospital and the Sick Kids Friends Foundation'

'Carrying out a number of roles for various charities, Princess Beatrice is clearly very committed to her charitable work, and we are thrilled to work with her to support a world-class hospital'

David
 Reith, chairman of the Sick Kids Friends Foundation’s Board of 
Trustees, said: 'We were delighted to welcome our new Royal patron, 
Princess Beatrice, to the Drop-In Centre and hospital.

'Today
 is a very special day for staff and patients who were very excited to 
meet the Princess. During her visit, the Princess was introduced to some
 of the young patients who have benefited from child and 
family-friendly facilities, equipment and staff training provided by the
 charity.

'Not only has
 the Princess' visit raised the spirits of the children receiving 
treatment on the wards and their families, but it is a day that will 
mark hospital history for the hard-working staff too.

'Since
 the charity’s inception in 1992, we have grown from strength to 
strength and now raise on average £1.5million a year. Every year, 900 
staff members at the RHSC serve 100,000 children with a broad spectrum 
of specialist services.

'The
 Foundation relies on community support to provide cutting-edge care and
 training to the RHSC's patients, families and staff. Without our 
dedicated staff, fundraisers and corporate partners, we would be unable 
to provide the high-quality care that we do.

'Carrying
 out a number of roles for various charities, Princess Beatrice is 
clearly very committed to her charitable work, and we are thrilled to 
work with her to support a world-class hospital.'
