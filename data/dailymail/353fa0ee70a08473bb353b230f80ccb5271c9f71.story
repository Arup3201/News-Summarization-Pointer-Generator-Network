Hollywood blockbuster Cast Away is recreated on a roundabout in Cambridge by a young movie maker.

Rob Thomson, 23, turned heads as he pretended to be marooned on a desert island - just like Tom Hanks in the Oscar-nominated movie - gathering sticks for a fire and cracking coconuts.

The film fanatic from St Ives, Cambridge has been paying homage to his heroes of the silver screen in a series of bizarre public stunts in Cambridge since June this year.

2. Independence Day

3. Forest Gump

4. Back To The Future

5. The Shining

The Cast Away spoof sees him dressed in rag-like clothing while sporting an enormous beard and wig on a roundabout next to Midsummer Common, Cambridge.

Onlookers may have been confused as Robson shouted at a football with a painted face, aka 'Wilson' - Hanks' beloved volleyball in the film.

The YouTube clip then skips to a shirtless Thomson jumping out of the small dinghy he had been rowing down the River Cam to rescue Wilson from the water.

The former Anglia Ruskin University film studies student, said: 'I thought the idea of a guy stranded on a roundabout was really funny.

'I really enjoyed doing it and when I shouted the final 'Wilson' from the river I received applause from the crowd.

'Generally people are either 'weirded' out or they start watching and enjoy the show.

'I've got lots of ideas for more films - my cameraman friend, Tony Stephens and I have a whole folder full of them.

'YouTube is such a great way for people to share the content they produce and we are now even making money from the films.'

Since it was uploaded on July 23, his spoof 'Cast Away- in real life' has already been watched more than 14,200 times.

His Batman impersonations, released in June, were viewed by 1.2 million people on the social media website.

Cambridge residents can look forward to more bizarre stunts, with Indiana Jones and Independence Day tipped as the next films.
