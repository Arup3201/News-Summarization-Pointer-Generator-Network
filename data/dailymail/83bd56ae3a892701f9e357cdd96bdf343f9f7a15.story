Mata, who has 32 caps for his country, is in Del Bosque's preliminary 30-man squad ahead of this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

The Manchester United midfielder will be hoping to continue to impress the 63-year-old before he finalises his final 23-man squad on June 2.

The defending champions are currently training in preparation for a friendly against Bolivia on Friday before flying out to South America.
