A former NYPD cop and his federal customs officer brother were sentenced to three years in prison for illegally exporting military-grade weapons for more than four years to the Philippines.

Rex Maralit, 46, had been with the NYPD for 11 years before he was fired after pleading guilty. Wilfredo Maralit, 49, was a Customs and Border Protection officer for nine years in California. 

The Maralit brothers often used their law enforcement jobs to help them purchase the weapons, such as by retrieving gun discounts given to police officers.

They did not have the required license issued by the State Department to sell the guns overseas, according to the New York Times.  

Instead they shipped the guns to their brother Ariel, who emailed his brothers specific 'buying orders' from customers, according to prosecutors.

Weapons the brothers shipped included assault rifles, AR-15s and semiautomatic weapons that had the power to penetrate police body armor and 'penetrate exterior walls, disable vehicles and even potentially down aircraft,' according to prosecutors.  

Rex and Wilfredo Maralit both pleaded guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act. 

They were told they would receive a lighter sentence if they could convince their brother Ariel to come to the United States and face charges, but the brothers were unsuccessful. 

Ariel Maralit continues to live in the Philippines and is considered a fugitive, according to the U.S. attorney's office. 

Judge Allyne R. Ross of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn said she wanted to give the public 'confidence that the rule of law applies with equal force to law enforcement officials and non-law enforcement officials' with the sentences. 

Rex Maralit said he had originally become involved in the gun trade to make some extra money for his family, and was hoping to make his business legal one day.

'I was blind to allow myself to believe that I was merely avoiding red tape,' he said. 

Wilfredo Maralit's lawyer Louis M. Freeman said the brothers' motivation was 'totally economic' during the trial last year. 

Freeman said there was 'no evidence' the brothers were 'interested in providing weapons for political purposes'.
