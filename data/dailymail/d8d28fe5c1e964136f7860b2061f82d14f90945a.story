A full-time Loch Ness monster hunter who's spent nearly quarter of a century looking for the elusive beast says it showed up on the one day he didn't have his camera on him.

Steve Feltham, 51, left his job fitting security cameras and his home in Dorset to move to the banks of Loch Ness in Inverness-shire and devote his time to searching for the legendary monster in 1991.

After two years of patiently scanning the loch, Mr Feltham says he finally caught a glimpse of Nessie, as the monster is known... but he didn't have his camera to hand.

Since then, he has kept a careful watch on the waters of the loch, but she has not shown herself again.

Elusive sight: This picture, taken by Dr Kenneth Wilson in 1934, is said to show the Loch Ness Monster

Mr Feltham says a childhood holiday to Loch Ness started his fascination with spotting the legendary monster

Mr Feltham, who said he became obsessed with the legend of Nessie after a family holiday to the Highlands when he was seven, said he spotted the monster in 1993.

He said: 'I was sitting on the shore near the Fort Augustus end of the loch when something went past the bay, through the water.

'It was like a torpedo shot and it had some weight behind it, hitting through the waves. 

'Nothing in Loch Ness could create a disturbance like that, apart from Nessie.  I just sat there in amazement.

'It was the moment I had always been waiting for, and I am kicking myself for not taking a photo.  Since then, I have been by the loch with my camera poised every day, come rain or shine. 

'Gutted is an understatement - I won't let an opportunity like that pass me by again.'

Mr Feltham's fascination with the Loch Ness Monster dates back to a childhood holiday to the Scottish Highlands in 1970.

He said: 'I remember standing on the banks of Loch Ness with my family and watching a big expedition of Nessie hunters set up a platform with a huge, metre-long camera.

'I remember being fascinated by the mystery of the monster, and I was hooked from there.'

As a teenager, he would spent two weeks at a time camping in a tent on the shores of the loch, but by the time he was 27, the passion had become all-consuming, so Mr Feltham decided to leave his home in Wimborne and move to Scotland.

He bought an old mobile library for £1,500, parked it in the car park of a pub called the Dores Inn, and has lived there ever since.

A bachelor, he spends his days studying the waters of the loch and making models of the monster which he sells to tourists to fund his simple lifestyle.said: 'This is my passion and exactly what I want to do with my life.'

Mr Feltham, who is from Dorset, says he is happy leading a simple life beside the loch in Inverness-shire

The bachelor says he has kept his camera close at hand ever since the moment in 1991 when he saw Nessie

He insists he's not lonely, preferring his own company and quiet contemplation, and he hasn't given up hope of seeing the monster a second time.

Mr Feltham said: 'I am hopeful I will see Nessie again, and I will be here ready with my camera every day until that day comes.

'I have been here for more than 20 years now, and this is my way of life.'

He also dismissed suggestions that the monster might be nothing more than a myth, saying: 'The loch is such a huge and mysterious body of water, containing more fresh water than the lakes of England and Wales combined, so it is the perfect place for a unknown sea creature to dwell.'

The legend of the Loch Ness Monster 
has been around since the sixth century, when an Irish monk called Saint 
Columba witnessed locals burying a man who had been attacked by a 'water
 beast.'

One of the first 
famous sightings was in 1933, when George
 Spicer and his wife claimed they saw 'a most extraordinary form of 
animal' which was 4ft high and 25ft long crossing the road near the 
loch.

The following year, Dr Robert Kenneth Wilson took a picture, in main story above, which is now the most famous picture of the monster, although it was later revealed to be a hoax made with a toy from Woolworth's.

Hunter Marmaduke Wetherell, centre, was said to have faked footprints which he said were the 'monster's'

And in 1935, renowned big game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell found a footprint he said was the monster's.  It was later revealed to have been made by him using a dried hippo's foot of the type used as umbrella stands at the time.

Despite many recording sightings over the years, most have been revealed to be hoaxes and scientists do not give credence to the suggestion that a monster lives in the loch.
