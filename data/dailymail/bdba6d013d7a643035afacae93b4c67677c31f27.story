The simple gesture of ‘Happy Ramadan’ signs across 239 Woolworths supermarkets has caused outrage among some offended customers.

The supermarket chain’s Facebook page was bombarded by comments from customers threatening to boycott the stores displaying the signs in areas with large Muslim populations.

But Woolworths spokesman Russell Mahoney insisted the Facebook page had not received any posts complaining about the Islamic festival.

Mr Mahoney defended using the signs, saying Muslims were not 'small minority', with 500,000 calling Australia home.

The supermarkets which had put up the signs were in areas where there were high Muslim populations, he said.

But the Australian Conservative Truth blog hit out at Woolworths saying the company 'backs islamic terrorism and slaughterfest of Ramadan - declares war on Aussies'.

'Just when you though (sic) Australia couldn't get any more crazy, now its number one grocery store, Woolworths is promoting islamic terrorism - wishing people Happy Ramadan (and event which usually involves mass murder by muslims around the world and a barbaric slaughter of helpless animals at the end (countless pictures of blood soaked events on the net)' the blog said.

This is not the first time the public has erupted over the supermarket chain's celebration of the Islamic fasting festival that runs for a month until July 27.

Customers expressed their disgust last year when signs were displayed across some stores.

Mick Lamb commented about the signs at the Mirrabooka store on the company's Facebook page on July 8 last year.

'Please take down references to Ramadan. It is offensive,' he posted.

'Your Mirrabooka store is promoting cruel and barbaric halal ritual slaughter of animals by promoting it.'

A conservative blog has accused the company of backing 'Islamic terrorism  and slaughterfest of Ramadan'.
