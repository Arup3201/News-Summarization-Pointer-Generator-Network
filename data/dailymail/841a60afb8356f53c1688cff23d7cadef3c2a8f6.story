A little girl in a red coat becomes the catalyst which saves the lives of more than 1,000 Jews destined for the concentration camps in Steven Spielberg’s celebrated film Schindler's List.

But for the now 24-year-old woman who played the role in 1993, the iconic appearance left her traumatised for years.

Oliwia Dabrowska was three years old when she starred as the girl in the red coat – the only flash of colour in the otherwise black-and-white film.

Unwilling star: Oliwia Dabrowska, aged three, plays the iconic 'girl in the red coat' in 1993 Oscar winning Schindler's List

Traumatised: Oliwia Dabrowska, 24, played a little girl in red coat in film Schindler's List and says it ruined years of her life

'I was ashamed of being in the movie and angry with my mother and father when they told anyone about the part,' the university student told The Times.

She added that starring in the film led to much unwanted attention and harassment from well-meaning adults and school friends.  

‘People said: “It must be so important to you, you must know so much about the Holocaust” I was frustrated by it all.’

Oliwia, from Krakow, said 
she was ‘horrified’ when watching the film for the first time at the age
of 11, breaking her promise to director Steven Spielberg to wait until 
she was 18.

She told the newspaper: 'I kept it secret for a long, long time, though at high school people got to know on the internet.

'People said: "It must be so important to you, you must know so much about the Holocaust." I was frustrated by it all.'

One of  the most disturbing scenes is one showing the SS officer Amon Goeth, played by Ralph Fiennes, who arbitrarily shoots women and children from his window.

Oliwia told The Times: 'It was too horrible. I could not understand much, but I was sure that I didn't want to watch ever again in my life.'

In the film, Ms Dabrowska plays a ‘little girl in the red coat’ spotted by Nazi industrialist Oskar Schindler during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto in 1943.

Traumatic: One of the most disturbing scenes for Oliwia is one showing the SS officer Amon Goeth, played by Ralph Fiennes, who arbitrarily shoots women and children from his window

'He was right': Oliwia said she should have listened to Steven Spielberg, pictured at the recognition of the 20th Anniversary of Schindler's List last week, and waited until she was 18 before watching Schindler's List

Nazi businessman and factory owner Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, sees
her wander through the crowds, her coat standing out among the sea of 
grey, and later spots her on a cart carrying dead bodies.

It
is after this harrowing experience that Schindler decides to draw up a 
list of Jewish workers in order to spare as many lives as he can.

The
film is based on the real life actions of Oskar 
Schindler, who was credited with saving more than 1,200 Jews during the 
Holocaust.

Ms Dabrowska says that although she now feels honoured to have played the role, it took her years to come to terms with it.

Saved from hell: Oskar Schindler saved his workers from the horrors of Plaszow concentration camp, south of Krakow, where the infamous Amon Goeth would shoot prisoners when he was bored

She now regrets having watched it at such an early age, and although she swore never to watch it again, she gave it another go at the age of 18 – just as she had promised the Oscar winning director.

'I realised I had been part of something I could be proud of. Spielberg was right: I had to grow up to watch the film.'

Ms Dabrowska continues to act in her spare time and is currently in her third year of a Library Science degree and hopes to go into publishing.

Schindler's List, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, won seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, seven BAFTAs and three Golden Globes, and is often ranked among the best films ever made.

Saviour: Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 of his Jewish workers during the Holocaust

Oskar Schindler was an ethnic German born in what is now the Czech Republic, in 1908.

A businessman, he saw the opportunities in profiting from the German invasion of Poland and bought an enamelware factory in Krakow.

He was a member of the Nazi party and mingled with the SS elite in the city.

He employed a large number of Jewish workers in his factory, mainly due to the lower costs of employing Jews after the German invasion.

After witnessing a raid during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, Oskar Schindler was shocked to find many of his employees murdered and created his legendary list of 'Schindlerjuden' (Schindler's Jews) to be spared from deportation to work in his factory.

It was made possible thanks to his German-speaking Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern and Schindler's close relationships with high-ranking SS officers in Krakow.

As the Holocaust continued Schindler used his lists to protect the over 1,200 workers and their families on his list.

He would go out of his way to convince SS inspectors that women, children and even the disabled were essential workers in his factory to spare them from being sent to the camps.

Having spent his fortune on bribes and black-market wares to for his workers, a destitute Schindler and his wife fled to Austria after the war.

He died, penniless, in Germany in 1974 at the age of 66, and was buried in Jerusalem. His grave carries the Hebrew inscription 'Righteous among the Nations'.
