Kris Commons spoke of his relief at securing his Celtic future on Thursday night – and warned that he is now in the perfect frame of mind to fight a battle on four fronts.

The impasse between the 31-year-old and the club was ended when the midfielder signed a two-year deal to kill off former manager Neil Lennon’s hopes of luring him to Bolton Wanderers under freedom of contract.

Commons, who Lennon signed from Derby in 2011, had looked to be on the way out of the club due to Celtic’s initial unwillingness to offer him a straight two-year deal.

The Mansfield-born star underscored his worth to the club when he scored a spectacular second goal in Sunday’s League Cup semi-final win over Rangers.

And  the club broke with recent policy for players over 30 by agreeing a deal which keeps him at Celtic Park until 2017.

Commons said: ‘It’s a great feeling. It’s a huge burden off my shoulders. Now I can concentrate on the proper stuff which is playing football and winning trophies at this club.

‘I’m delighted to be staying here. Absolutely buzzing. It’s been a strange couple of months. Speculation is never good for the mind when you are trying to concentrate on playing at the top level. Glasgow and Celtic feel like home to myself and my family.

‘That’s credit to the people of Glasgow and how they’ve welcomed us right from the word go. It’s a very family orientated club and it’s a massive relief for myself and my family that our future is secure now.

‘I want to win more league titles here. It would be wonderful if we could add a few more cups to the cabinet but I think when you think of Celtic it’s all about European football and if we can get into the Champions League again next year and hopefully the year after that it would be a huge achievement for us.

The 31-year-old was Celtic's top scorer last season with 31 goals in all competitions

‘The Inter Milan game will be a big draw with a full house under the floodlights. That’s always a magical experience so hopefully we can turn up for that game and give them a sense of what we are all about.

‘That’s a good game to look forward to. But we’re involved in all four competitions so hopefully we’ll have a very successful year.’

The reigning PFA Scotland and SFWA player of the year, Commons scored 31 goals in Lennon’s final year in Glasgow.

But, despite his popularity with the fans, a string of substitute appearances at the outset of Ronny Deila’s reign gave fuel to the theory that he wasn’t in the Norwegian’s long-term plans.

Deila not only denied that, he predicted that Commons would remain at the club throughout the contract impasse.

Deila said: ‘I am really pleased that Kris has committed his future to the club.

‘He is someone who has already made a great contribution to Celtic and I am sure he will continue to be a very important player for us as we work hard to bring our fans the success they deserve.”

‘We have had a good week after reaching the League Cup final and following the fantastic signings of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, Kris’s contract extension is even more great news for the club and our supporters.’
