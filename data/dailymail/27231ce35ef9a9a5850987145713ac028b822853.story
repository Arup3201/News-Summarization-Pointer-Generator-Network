Andy Murray and James Ward headed off to California on Monday, knowing that they may well have sacrificed the first Masters level event of the year in the British cause.

After sealing GB's win over America in the Davis Cup, they have a ridiculously quick turnaround before the ATP tournament starts later this week in the desert setting of Indian Wells.

Ward is expected to play in the qualifying event on Tuesday, while at least Murray gets a few days' grace before the main draw begins.

Individual compared to team environment, altitude compared to sea level, the desert dry heat compared to Glasgow's cold, the seven hour time difference – it could hardly be more contrasting.

Murray, now back up to No 4 in the world, said: 'It's going from playing on an indoor court with heavy tennis balls to playing in the desert with very fast balls in very quick conditions in terms of how the ball moves through the air there.'

The British No 1 said it is far more realistic for him to do well in the Miami Open that follows later this month.

'That would be a target for me to have a very good run,' he admitted.

The dates and structure of the Davis Cup continue to be a problem and those like Murray and Ward, who have chosen to play for their country, will be at a considerable disadvantage over the next 10 days.

As Murray reflected, this is one reason why the likes of Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka sat out the first round of a competition which, as the weekend demonstrated, is a showcase for so much that is good about the sport.

Murray will be reunited with coach Amelie Mauresmo for these two hard court events. He is also not far from appointing an assistant to her, who will be important in the weeks that she is unable to travel.

Referring to his search he commented: 'I'd say it's fairly close. Over the next few days I'll try to arrange someone to do a trial period in the next month or so.

'Amelie is next not with me at the beginning of the clay-court stretch (in April). I get married the week after Miami. I'm not 100 per cent sure what I'm going to do afer that.'

As Glasgow was the latest Davis Cup tie to show, there can be a real passion for tennis outside Wimbledon in the UK: 'It's up to the LTA to capitalise on it, that's not my job,' said Murray.

'I think it's valuable. You see the enthusiasm and the passion that people clearly have for tennis right now. That's great.

'I'm just happy that when we've been able to play the big events of the last few years, the crowds have been absolutely fantastic every time. 

'Again in the summer I'm sure we can fill another big arena. But we need more than just putting these sort of events on.'

He also revealed that LTA Chief Executive Michael Downey has still not had a proper conversation with him about improving tennis in Great Britain after 14 months in the job.

They had 15 minutes together in Glasgow which, Murray confirmed, was their longest meeting to date: 'I haven't given my opinion or thoughts on how that should be done. 

'I just listened to what he had to say,' said the 27-year-old Scot, sounding distinctly non-plussed.

'He sort of took me through a one-page plan, strategy, in terms of how they were going to get more people playing the game. Getting more people playing is obviously important. 

'But it's one thing saying it, putting it down on a piece of paper. It's another thing doing it.'

It is astonishing that Downey, who is Canadian, has not taken the trouble to thoroughly consult Britain's finest player since Fred Perry. 

What a criminal waste of Murray's experience, sharp intelligence and obvious passion for British tennis.
