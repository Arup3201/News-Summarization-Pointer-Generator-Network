Jenson Button has been left baffled by Lewis Hamilton's 'strange' performance during a collision-fuelled German Grand Prix.

The two former McLaren team mates got in a tangle as Hamilton attempted a pass on lap 30 during a charge up from 20th on the Hockenheim grid to a third place finish behind Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg.

It was the last of three separate incidents involving Hamilton and ended up Button running over the left-wing endplate of his fellow Brit's car.

When Hamilton eventually passed Button on the following lap, he held up his right hand by way of an apology, later claiming he felt the 34-year-old was letting him through.

Hamilton said: 'I had a little bit of a collision with Jenson.

'I honestly thought he was opening the door to let me past. He's been a bit like that in the past, for example, so my bad judgement there.'

Button was left surprised by Hamilton's remarks as he said: 'Why would we let anyone through?

'I don't know if you've noticed, but a lot of drivers do that line to get a good exit from the corner.

'I think the problem with Lewis is he expected me to let him past, but I don't think I'm the only person he drove into.

'It's strange, but when the car's so much quicker you'd think he wouldn't get into so many fights, but there you go.

'He drove into my rear wheel, that's all I've got to say and I don't know much else about it.

'I'm out there doing my race. It would make it boring if we all let him past when he was coming through the field.'
