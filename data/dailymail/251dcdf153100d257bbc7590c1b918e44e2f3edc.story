'Terrible': Presenter Clare Balding has spoken about her grandmother's reaction to her being a lesbian and her cancer diagnosis

Clare Balding has revealed that her grandmother branded her ‘disgusting’ for being a lesbian.

The 42-year-old broadcaster said her grandmother made the  remark after a newspaper reported that she and former newsreader Alice Arnold, 50, were a couple.

She told Desert Island Discs: ‘I said, “Have you seen the paper?” and she said, “Yes, and I think it’s disgusting.” ‘I said, “What, the invasion of my privacy or my lifestyle choice?” and she said both.

‘I didn’t talk to her for about six months after that and that was pretty difficult.’

Miss Balding, who fronts Channel 4’s racing coverage, said she and her grandmother eventually made peace thanks to her dog, Archie, who ‘broke the ice’.

Miss Balding also admitted she struggled to cope when she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, adding she 'pretended it wasn't happening'.

The sports presenter - who first noticed a lump on her throat while watching herself on TV - said she was 'hopeless' following the diagnosis in 2009.

Speaking candidly on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, she said: 'I was terrible.

'I couldn’t take it in. I was pretty hopeless. I pretended it wasn’t happening.'

The presenter, 42, became emotional when she recalled breaking the news to her partner - radio presenter Alice Arnold.

She said: 'We sat and cried. Alice kept saying to me, "What did the doctors say?" and I couldn’t remember, so she ended up coming to every consultation with me.'

Ms Balding first noticed a lump on her throat while watching herself on TV in Christmas 2008.

The star was diagnosed in June 2009, announcing she was in remission just a few months later in August.

She had the lump drained by a doctor - but when she returned for a check-up was told she needed a further operation.

The presenter returned to work soon after surgery, covering the Spring Meeting at Epsom for the BBC at the end of April.

She had a second operation to remove the 
remaining cells before undergoing radioactive iodine treatment. She 
announced she had been given the all-clear in early 2011.

When asked by Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young how her health was now, she replied 'fantastic'.

The
 interview comes as was revealed that the presenter refused to host 
coverage this year’s Open golf championship at Muirfield because of the 
Scottish club’s ban on women becoming members.

In the programme, the presenter spoke about being 'outed' in 2003 after she attended a film premier with her partner Alice, 51.

She said: 'My
 parents knew but my grandmother didn’t. I said, "Grandma, I
 need to talk to you", and she said, "yes, I should think you do".

'I
 said, "Have you seen the papers?" and she said, "Yes and I think it is 
disgusting". [I asked] "What, the invasion of my privacy or my lifestyle
 choice?" and she said, "Both".

'I didn’t talk to her for about six months after that and that was pretty difficult. But we’re fine now.'

The couple have been together for 11 years - and had a civil partnership in 2006.

Ms Balding's treatment coincided an interview with Grand National winner Liam Treadwell where she told the jockey he could now afford some new teeth - now coined 'toothgate'.

The jockey had a condition called hypodontia - meaning some of his teeth were missing.

'National treasure': Despite some ups and downs throughout her career, Ms Balding was widely praised for her involvement in the Olympic and Paralympic coverage last year

Ms Balding said the combination of both the controversy and her illness 'wasn't great'.

She added: 'You
 have to say "What can I do to make sure I don’t do that again?". But 
because I was going into hospital straight afterwards I gave Alice my 
phone which never stopped and she was not able to say to them, "Will you
 just leave her alone she’s just being wheeled down to the anaesthetic".

'I didn’t want anyone to know I was ill. I didn’t want to use that as an excuse.

She admitted she regretted the incident - saying 'I think I was just trying to be one of the boys. [It was] not very clever.'

However, the presenter has now put her illness and the controversy behind her - and has been widely praised for her work on the Olympic and Paralympics last year.

Ms Balding's choice of music on the 45-minute show included the theme to The New Adventures of Black Beauty television series.

Other tracks included Beautiful Noise by 
Neil Diamond, a favourite of her mothers, and She’s Got A Way by Billy Joel  - a song played at her civil partnership ceremony.

She chose a luxury of a thermos cup with tea, milk and sugar and her book was an encyclopaedia of nature.

Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 today at 11.15am
