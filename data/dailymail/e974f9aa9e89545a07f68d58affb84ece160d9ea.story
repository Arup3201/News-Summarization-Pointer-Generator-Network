Sometimes an Instagram account comes along that has us hooked from the first click, and photographer Dave Benett's account may be the one that tops them all.

Friend to the stars since he started out as a celebrity photographer in the 1970s, the snapper's Instagram account is a veritable who's who of the rich and famous.

From Kate Moss snuggled up to Alexander McQueen in 1998, to Princess Diana and Liza Minelli gossiping behind cupped hands in 1991, it is the ultimate guilty pleasure for celebrity fans seeking a behind the scenes look at their favourite stars in rare off-duty moments.

Mr Benett has long been a friend of the rich and famous.

In the early 1980s, having decided to focus entirely on entertainment photography, he joined London’s Evening Standard newspaper, supplying them with iconic images of the world’s most famous celebrities and stars enjoying night's out around the capital.

Having photographed everyone from The Queen and Michael Jackson to Nelson Mandela and Elton John, he is perhaps most famously know for  immortalising a little Versace black dress worn by Elizabeth Hurley, on the arm of her former boyfriend, Hugh Grant.

Having only started uploading his iconic pictures to Instagram in October 2014, the snapper's page has remained relatively unknown with only 6,803 followers on his page. 

'It was my daughter Camille - who is now my creative director - who persuaded me to give the public access to these images,' says Mr Benett.

'Many of them have never been seen before and it seems that suddenly people are taking notice of my Instagram.

'People have forgotten that to take a great picture requires access - access is where the greatest images come from.'
