Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie’s names will forever be etched on the scoresheet that immortalises Manchester United’s 3-0 win over Liverpool, but few would argue it was keeper David de Gea who had the biggest hand in the result.

The Spanish keeper was outstanding as he tormented the Reds with eight official saves – six of them were match-changing and four were in one-on-one situations that should have favoured the player with the ball.

Former Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina, who is now at Bayen Munich, said Liverpool wouldn't have lost were it not for De Gea and that his countryman was the best on the pitch 'by miles'. Former United custodian Peter Schmeichel had one word - 'brilliant'.

Here is how De Gea thwarted Brendan Rodgers' strikerless plot that saw false No 9 Raheem Sterling come face to face on a number of occasions with the keeper and come off second best.

The introduction of a recognised front man at half-time didn't even help, with Mario Balotelli's efforts also drawing athletic stops from the impenetrable 24-year-old.

1) 12th minute

Raheem Sterling is slips in behind the United defence and Adam Lallana delivers a no-look through ball into his path. One-on-one with De Gea, Sterling tries to shoot to the far post but can't beat the keeper's outstretched left leg. Rooney scores at the other end 25 seconds later.

2) 23rd minute

Sterling turns Phil Jones inside out to bring himself one-on-one again with De Gea, who makes himself big and saves with his right thigh.

3) 51st minute

Sterling swoops on a shocking pass back to De Gea. The Liverpool speedster appears to have him beaten but keeps his feet, forces Sterling to take one more touch than he’d like to before showing his agility and saving with his right leg.

4) 67th minute

Sterling finds Balotelli in the box and the Italian hits his side-footed shot first time with substantial power – De Gea's gloves tip the ball onto the cross bar. A raw display of reflexes from a stopper at the top of his game.

5) 82nd minute

Balotelli again gets a chance in the box courtesy of Sterling and shoots off balance through the traffic of two defenders right in front of De Gea. The keeper takes is easily though, diving low to his right and holding onto the ball to prevent further drama.

6) 85th minute

Balotelli is again found by a piercing through ball, this time from Lazar Markovic, and the Italian really should score. But again De Gea is up to the task.
