Grandpa Charles! The royal revealed that he wants his new grandson to call him 'grandpa' as he visited the 132nd Sandringham Flower Show at Sandringham House in Norfolk

Prince Charles has revealed he will insist on being called 'Grandpa' by Prince George.

The Prince of Wales announced his preference to an elderly well-wisher at the Sandringham Flower Show.

Charles, who was accompanied by his wife Camilla, told Keith Dixon, 70, from Oundle, Northants he wanted to be known as 'grandpa' and not 'granddad'. 

He then told another member of the crowd he plans to be hands-on with his first grandson.But he added he may take some babysitting lessons first as it was so long since he helped with his own children.

Freda Aspinall, 73, of Chatteris, Cambs., said: 'He told me ‘I think I’m going to have to go on a babysitting course as it’s a while since I have done this sort of thing’.

'I then said to Camilla: ‘What does the baby look like?’

'She said that he looks absolutely gorgeous - that he doesn’t really look like anyone else at the moment but that he’s a really beautiful baby.'

During the visit Prince Charles hinted at his excitement at George’s arrival by telling 10-year-old Rebecca Haime from Brundall, Norfolk, he hopes she has nice grandparents.

He also joked with fellow grandparent Anne Lee, 62, from Dereham, Norfolk that she had beaten him to it by two years.

The couple were given a large numbers of gifts for Prince George including a hand-made shawl and an array of teddy bears and flowers.

Charles was pictured face to face with Zephyr, a huge bald eagle which will become the mascot of the Army Air Corps.

When asked what she would like to be called by baby George the Duchess of Cornwall said the family 'haven’t decided' for certain.

But she revealed to the Daily Mail that ‘GaGa’ is what her own grandchildren call her.

‘I don’t know if it’s because they think I am,’ she joked, ‘but it is still very sweet.’

Camilla disclosed her quirky nickname as she and Prince Charles visited the Sandringham Flower Show in Norfolk, which is held on the Queen’s private estate.

Seeking shelter from the rain in the Sandringham Women’s Institute tent, Camilla chatted proudly about Prince William and Kate’s ‘lovely’ new addition to the family as she stocked up on £1.20 packets of chocolate buns.

For many families in which parents are divorced or separated, the issue of what to call a step-grandparent can become a social minefield, sometimes causing bitter rifts – although clearly not here.

Family: The Duchess has forged an affectionate relationship with her two stepsons, William and Harry

Camilla spoke fondly about her brood of grandchildren: ‘We are all just about to go off on holiday together, there will be seven children in all. Can you imagine? It can be quite chaotic, but I just love having them around.’

Camilla has five grandchildren under the age of five from the two children she had during her first marriage to Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles.

Her son, Tom Parker Bowles, has two children with his wife, Sara: Lola, five, and Freddy, three. Her daughter, Laura Lopes, and her husband Harry also have Eliza, five, and twins Gus and Louis, three.

Although she was described as  ‘the Rottweiler’ by William’s late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, friends say Camilla is a warm and generous woman, who adores her growing family.

She frequently chats happily about how the ‘entire brood’ regularly take over her private home in Wiltshire at weekends.

She has also managed to forge an affectionate relationship with her two stepsons, William and Harry, and was seen offering Kate some wifely advice over lunch shortly before her wedding.

As his wife chatted about pet names, Prince Charles was busy collecting gifts from well-wishers to be passed on to baby Prince George, including teddy bears, babygros and books.

Charles said: ‘It’s a wonderful feeling [to be a grandfather]. It’s a very nice feeling, isn’t it?’

He was clearly delighted to receive a teddy bear embroidered with George’s name from 55-year-old Sheila Clark, of Glasgow, asking: ‘You didn’t put a bet on it did you?’ Unfortunately not, she said.

He also told Freda Aspinall, 73, herself a great-grandmother, that baby George was ‘very sweet’ but it was ‘too early to say’ who he looked like.

‘I think I am going to have to go on a babysitting course as it’s a while since I have done this sort of thing,’ he added.
