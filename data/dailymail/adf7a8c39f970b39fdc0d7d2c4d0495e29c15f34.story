A popular Xbox game has come under fire after being blighted with technical problems and bugs which fans claim make it impossible to play online.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which is designed for the Xbox One, has been marred with issues since it was released in the UK two weeks ago.

Despite being one of the biggest games to be released on the console this year, developers have been forced to issue dozens of updates as part of attempts to fix the problems.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which is designed for the Xbox One, has been marred with issues since it was released in the UK two weeks ago. The main issues surround the 'multiplayer' function of the game

The main issues are said to revolve around the online gaming aspect of Halo, where players can access a multiplayer function to battle against each other.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which costs about £40, comprises of all the Halo titles which have been released since the original Xbox came out in 2001.

The previous titles have been digitally upgraded so they are compatible with the new Xbox One, which costs in the region of £329.99.

343 Industries, the Microsoft-owned developer of Halo, said numerous updates have been released to try and resolve the problems but said ‘far too many’ players remain affected.

Today, Bonnie Ross, the founder of 343 industries, issued a heartfelt apology to fans for the issues surrounding the game.

In a blog post, she wrote: ‘On Nov 11 we released Halo: The Master Chief Collection. The goal being to create a tribute to Halo fans around the world, and to celebrate the Master Chief’s debut on Xbox One.

‘With the initial release of Halo: The Master Chief Collection, however, we have not delivered the experience you deserve. I personally apologise for this on behalf of us all at 343 Industries. Our team is committed to working around the clock until these issues are resolved.

‘While our team works on continual improvements and towards solutions, my commitment to you is that we will take care of all owners of Halo: The Master Chief Collection.

‘Our primary and continued focus is first on fixing the issues at hand. Once we’ve done that, we will detail how we will make this right with our fans.’

Ms Ross also announced that multiple content updates would be issued over the coming weeks as part of desperate attempts to fix the problems.

Bonnie Ross, founder of 343 Industries, has personally apologised for the issues and vowed to get them fixed

She said: ‘On the matchmaking front, we have encountered unexpected issues that were not apparent in our internal test environment and that have resulted in a frustrating experience, including long matchmaking times and low session success rates.

‘Within 343 Industries and Xbox, I can assure you that resolving these issues is our #1 priority (sic).

‘We continue to partner with the Xbox platform team to analyse all data to make ongoing server-side adjustments to continually improve the matchmaking experience.

‘We are also preparing additional content updates that will address existing campaign, UI, and other issues to improve the overall experience.

‘With each update we will carefully analyse data to confirm that the improvements we’re seeing internally are also happening with fans at home.

‘Know that we’re trying to be as nimble as possible to put fixes in place. We are planning multiple server-side tweaks and game content updates over the coming weeks.’

She said the next release would come later in the week before adding: ‘Please accept my heartfelt apologies for the delay and for the negative aspects of your experience to date.

‘We’re doing everything in our power to resolve it as quickly as possible.’

Earlier this month, Phil Spencer, the head of Microsoft’s Xbox division, took to Twitter to apologise for the issues after receiving a barrage of criticism from fans.

He wrote: ‘Sorry about the issues. I know our fans expect more from us. Team is making progress but I know it’s still disappointing.’ 

However, his tweet was later deleted.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection was billed as the ultimate package which would allow players to enjoy all four Halo games on the Xbox One.

Players would take on the role of cyborg soldiers and have access to more than 100 multiplayer maps on which their virtual character could battle against others.
