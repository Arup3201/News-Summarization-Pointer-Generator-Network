A core sample is retrieved: The iron stimulates plankton growth, which 'binds' carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere - getting rid of one of the gases which warms Earth's atmosphere

A ship dumping iron into the Southern Ocean has shown off a technique that could be the 'cure' for climate change.

The iron stimulates plankton growth, which 'binds' carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere - getting rid of one of the gases which warms Earth's atmosphere.

A trial, called Eifex, has been hailed a success, after a bloom of plankton sank 1,000 metres below the ocean, taking with it carbon dioxide.

At present, the technique could only 
be used to 'mop up' around a tenth of global carbon emissions - but 
scientists continue to investigate.

'We were able to prove that over 50 per cent of the plankton bloom sank
below 1000 metre depth indicating that their carbon content can be 
stored in the deep ocean and in the underlying seafloor sediments for 
time scales of well over a century,' says Prof. Dr. Victor Smetacek  
from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the 
Helmholtz Association.

Previous experiments which aimed to 'bind' carbon in this way failed. 

'Such controlled iron fertilization experiments in the ocean enable us 
to test hypotheses and quantify processes that cannot be studied in 
laboratory experiments. The results improve our understanding of 
processes in the ocean relevant to climate change' says Smetacek.

'The 
controversy surrounding iron fertilization experiments has led to a 
thorough evaluation of our results before publication'

The experiments attempts to recreate conditions during previous ice ages.

During past ice ages the air was 
cooler and drier than it is today and more iron-containing dust was 
transported from the continents to the ocean by the wind.

The iron supply to marine 
phytoplankton was hence higher during the ice ages. This natural process
is simulated in iron fertilisation experiments under controlled 
conditions.

Iron plays an important role in the 
climate system. It is involved in many biochemical processes such as 
photosynthesis and is hence an essential element for biological 
production in the oceans and, therefore, for CO2 absorption from the 
atmosphere.

An international research team  published the results of an ocean iron fertilization experiment (EIFEX) carried out in 2004 in the current issue of the scientific journal Nature.

Unlike the LOHAFEX experiment carried out in 2009, EIFEX has shown that a substantial proportion of carbon from the induced algal bloom sank to the deep sea floor. These results, which were thoroughly analyzed before being published now, provide a valuable contribution to our better understanding of the global carbon cycle.An international team on board the research vessel Polarstern fertilized in spring 2004 (i.e. at the end of the summer season in the southern hemisphere) a part of the closed core of a stable marine eddy in the Southern Ocean with dissolved iron, which stimulated the growth of unicellular algae (phytoplankton).

The team followed the development of the phytoplankton bloom for five weeks from its start to its decline phase.

The maximum biomass attained by the bloom was with a peak chlorophyll stock of 286 Milligram per square metre higher than that of blooms stimulated by the previous 12 iron fertilization experiments.

According to Prof. Dr. Victor Smetacek  from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in the Helmholtz Association, this was all the more remarkable because the EIFEX bloom developed in a 100 metre deep mixed layer which is much deeper than hitherto believed to be the lower limit for bloom development.The bloom was dominated by diatoms, a group of algae that require dissolved silicon to make their shells and are known to form large, slimy aggregates with high sinking rates at the end of their blooms.

These results contrast with those of the LOHAFEX experiment carried out in 2009 where diatom growth was limited by different nutrient conditions, especially the absence of dissolved silicon in the chosen eddy.

Instead, the plankton bloom consisted of other types of algae which, however, have no protective shell and were eaten more easily by zooplankton.

'This shows how differently communities of organisms can react to the addition of iron in the ocean', says Dr. Christine Klaas. 'We expect similarly detailed insights on the transportation of carbon between atmosphere, ocean and sea bottom from the further scientific analysis of the LOHAFEX data", adds Prof. Dr. Wolf-Gladrow, Head of Biosciences at the Alfred Wegener Institute, who is also involved in the Nature study.
