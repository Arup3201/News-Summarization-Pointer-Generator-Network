A short-sighted driver who killed a pensioner crossing the road after leaving the house with the wrong glasses has been jailed.

Peter Conroy, 73, who is blind in his right eye and has impaired vision in his left, was wearing reading glasses instead of his long vision spectacles when he hit Audrey Noden, 93, and her 63-year-old daughter.

Mrs Noden was rushed to hospital with a fractured pelvis and leg. She died of thrombosis due to a lack of movement a month later.

Her daughter Margaret Elvidge suffered a fractured vertebrae and a broken leg.

Today Conroy, who pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, was sentenced to two years in jail and banned from driving for 10 years.

Judge Stuart Rafferty QC: 
'You should not have been driving.

'Although you didn’t intend it to be that way as soon as you got behind the wheel that car became a potentially lethal weapon.

'I
 know you will find prison extraordinarily difficult. For you it will be
 a very hard punishment but it is a punishment that ends whereas the 
loss that the family have is life long.'

Conroy, who was recovering from a stroke at the time, had narrowly avoided two other crashes
 before the incident on September 4, 2012, but ignored other drivers' 
warnings to pull over, Lincoln Crown Court heard.

He drove his Ford Mondeo at 15mph at he headed to 
Sainsbury's to carry out his weekly shop.

Mrs Noden was described in court as 'vibrant' and 'active'.

Conroy narrowly avoided two crashes before hitting Mrs Noden and her daughter Margaret Elvidge in Lincoln

She walking to the Co-Op from the health centre with Mrs Elvidge, saw he was driving slowly and assumed he was stopping, the court heard.

David Allan, prosecuting, said: 'He 
was unfit to be driving a car. He simply failed to see these women. It 
was a wide and straight road. That morning it was dry and clear.

'At
 the pedestrian crossing they paused at the side of the road and a van 
stopped. Margaret Elvidge saw the defendant’s car approaching. He was 
travelling very slowly and she assumed he had seen them and was slowing 
down to let them cross.

'They took two steps into the road and the defendant’s car simply ploughed into both of them.'

It
 emerged Conroy lied when renewing his licence just months before the 
incident, failing to tell the DVLA that he is partially blind and has glaucoma.

Testing his sight at the scene, police found he could not read a number 
plate further than four metres away. Legally, drivers must be able to 
read a number plate at 20 metres.

Alison Summers, defending, said Conroy was of limited intellect and did not appreciate how bad his eye sight was.

'It is accepted that his driving was dangerous. He is very sorry for the loss of this lady’s life.'

Mrs Noden’s family blasted the sentence, 
saying: 'No sentence really alters anything. We have lost our mum. It 
doesn’t bring our mum back.'
