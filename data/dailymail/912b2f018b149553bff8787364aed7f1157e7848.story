A secondary school has outraged parents after introducing a 'tinkle pass' which allows students out of lessons to use the toilet just once a week.

The cards are issued to students at Castle Vale Performing Arts College in Birmingham every Monday morning.

If students don't use them, they must hand them in on a Friday afternoon to ensure they aren't carried forward to the next week.

The specially designed 'tinkle card' reads: 'I am missing a super learning opportunity because I need a tinkle.'

New headmistress at the school, Charlotte Blencowe, is responsible for the introduction of the cards after introducing a series of new strict policies after taking over during the summer.

Students have also been told they can only communicate in class via a series of hand-signals.

These include 'Fingers to eyes and then to the board = I can't see', 'To hands clasped in the air = I need a new book or paper' and '3 fingers in the air = I need the toilet.'

Pupils have also been told that their bags would be searched to ensure their mobile phones are switched off and to check that they have the required number of pens and pencils.

The new rules come after parents staged 
an angry protest outside the college on Thursday after 40 students were 
sent home for wearing the wrong shoes.

Police were called when crowds of 
parents gathered outside the gates, furious that their children had been
 turned away for breaching a tough new uniform code.

Eggs were thrown at the teachers during the protest.

Teresa Doyle's children, Ellie, 13, and Connoe, 15, attend the school.

She said: 'It's a secondary school but they're treating it more like a nursery with all these hand signals and "tinkle cards".'

'My kids are saying to me, "Mum, we're not at school, we're at a prison".'

'They're not allowed to talk in class at all and must do everything by these bizarre hand signals.'

Mrs Doyle said all pupils were allowed into school yesterday even though many still 'broke' the new uniform rules.

She said: 'There were crowds of parents in reception complaining, but no-one's yet managed to talk to the headteacher.

'One parent spotted the headteacher in the corridor and tried to speak to her but she refused.

'She told one of the other teachers to speak to him and then turned her back on him.'

Miss Blencoe, who reportedly once dated the son of Chuckle Brothers star Barry Elliot, has refused to comment on the allegations.

Another parent said: 'It's ridiculous because what happens if the child needs to use the toilet during class more than once a week?

Trouble: Parents and pupils staged an angry protest outside the college on Thursday after 40 students were sent home for wearing the wrong shoes

'What are they supposed to do - wet themselves?'

The only communication given to parents has been via deputy headteacher, Mark Riggall.

Parents yesterday received a text message telling them to go to the school website and download a letter written by Mr Riggall.

It reads: 'I would officially like to thank everybody who has worked hard to make the day today such a success.

Not happy: Connor Simons, 12, whose mother Wendy had to go to Asda and buy him a pair of shoes for £25

'The atmosphere inside school was calm and focused, allowing all students to engage their learning in a positive way.'

The letter goes on to list the types of shows which are acceptable, with Mr Riggall saying he needed to 'clear up some issues' from the first day of term.

The letter then states that students wearing the appropriate shoes would be allowed into lessons, whilst those who are not 'will be held in the main hall until the correct footwear is brought into school.'
