Oops!  A learner driver smashed through a front wall and into a house in Netley, Hampshire, after losing control on a tight corner

A learner driver who lost control on a tight corner was lucky to escape injury when she ploughed her car through a wall and into a house.

The motorist, a woman in her thirties, was driving with a passenger when she smashed her black Hyundai Getz, which had an L-plate on the back, into a house in the village of Netley, near Southampton.

The car destroyed a garden wall and smashed a large hole in the front of the terraced property, which was empty at the time, and both the driver and her male companion walked away unhurt.

Paramedics were called and assessed the pair, while emergency services cordoned off part of the road and the car was taken away on a truck.

One neighbour told how he heard a loud thump at around 1.30pm on Saturday.

James Myles, 63, said: 'I came round and saw the car buried in there and the couple in it were just getting out.

'I was relieved nobody was hurt. They were very lucky and it was lucky there was nobody inside.'

Mr Myles, who said the junction was a difficult one to navigate because of on-road parking, said he gave the couple a cup of tea to calm them down as they sat on the wall after the smash.

Neighbour Duncan Matthews, 36, was doing building work on his house when he was alerted to the crash.

He said: 'I just heard a humongous thud and my wife and I both looked at each other and my wife said "What was that?".

'There were 50 people out there within two minutes. It just looked awful.'

Sgt Alex Banks of Hedge End police said they would be making further inquiries to try to establish what happened.

The female householder returned to her house later but did not want to comment.
