It was June 6, 1944, and shells were falling all around him as he made a ‘wild scramble to the shore’ and recoiled from the ‘din of battle’.

But Leopole ‘Eric’ Wormald, of Mickley, Northumberland, never boasted about his exploits during the Second World War - including how he survived D-Day after landing on the beaches of Normandy.

Now, the shop grocer’s secret diaries have been revealed - telling of his quiet heroism amid the horrors that he witnessed during his service with the Army from 1941 to 1945.

Prisoner of war details: Eric Wormald described how he was captured and taken to a POW camp surviving on little food and celebrating his birthday while imprisoned

Soldiers: In his diary Eric Wormald talked of friends he had not seen and how he hoped they were safe

It was not until after his death in 
the 1980s aged 77 that his wife Gladys and son Cedric discovered the diary he wrote on D-Day and letters while he 
was a prisoner of war.

Grandfather-of-two
 Cedric Wormald, 66, of Howdon, Tyne and Wear, now wants to share his father’s story with others 
as the country prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day.

He
 said: ‘He obviously wanted someone to read it at some time. I would 
just like to share it.

'You either write it down and one day someone will
 read it or you write it down to get it out of your mind. I just think 
others should know what it was like.’

In
 the pages of his diary, Eric Wormald speaks of the moment he arrived on
 the beaches, losing members of his company and narrowly escaping mortar
 bomb blasts.

From his D-Day notes, marked June 6, 1944, he writes: ‘After breakfast I went on deck and could hear the bombers going out and could see the flashes from their bombs on the French coast.’

Thousands of Allied soldiers, mostly from the United States, Britain and Canada, landed in Normandy to begin the drive to break the German occupation of Europe in 1944.

The soldiers charged the shores of five beaches in northern France, facing German land mines, machine guns and heavy artillery.

The invasion, a victory for the allies, is known as the key turning point of the war.

Some 215,000 Allied soldiers, and roughly as many Germans, were killed or wounded during D-Day and the ensuing three months before the Allies captured Normandy, opening a path toward Paris that eventually took them to Germany and victory over the Nazis.

Later in the day, he continues: ‘The sight at sea was one which will take some describing. Ships of all sorts and sizes and the din of battle was all around.

‘On one side of us we had HMS Renown and on the other side HMS Rodney. We were very lucky as shells were falling all around us. Landed on beach (first LCA [Landing Craft Assault] to land) 7.45am.

‘Jumped into sea which was up to my shoulders, nearly lost my balance and fell. Made a wild scramble to the shore and got to the sands safely. Going up the sands, there were many things in my mind.

‘First my wife, lying peacefully in bed, little did she know that the invasion was in progress and that I was on French soil at that moment, I thought of everyone at home and wondered how they would take the news.’

Cedric Wormald believes the notes his father made on D-Day were written on his return home to the North East.

‘I think when he came back he wrote that, whether to get it out of his mind, or they said “Write down what you went through on the day”,’ he said.

‘I was very proud of him when I read it. He has always been my hero - but when you see what he went through and how he came back to the shop and just picked up normal life, it’s amazing.’

In the notes he made on D-Day, Eric Wormald went on to describe his terrifying moments on the beach.

‘Then it happened, the next mortar bomb dropped near us and Dossol, Knight and two others were wounded, how badly I don’t know because I could not think of anything else but to get away from the attack. I took a chance and ran to the top of the beach.’

Eric Wormald said he thanked God for his good luck so far as he was the only one to escape without a scratch. In his diary he talked of friends he had not seen and how he hoped they were safe.

‘Got off beaches and fought on all day. Lost a good many of the company including Lt Bawdon and Lt Williamson (Both killed in action),’ he wrote.

Writing about the night after D-Day, he said: ‘Slept as best we could at night in jerry dug outs, hardly saw any jerry planes until dusk.

‘Next morning my first job was to make Major Matt’s breakfast and my own. Fought on all next day. Our worst encounters were Jerry snipers. Killed one French woman sniping for Jerry and captured other two.

‘We also took a large number of prisoners. June 10, marched through streets of Bayeux. A little French girl filled my hat with cherries and gave me a lovely rose. (If ever there were tears in my eyes it was at this moment).

‘Camped the night outside Bayeux, moved on next day. June 13 got ambushed by Jerry and with four others got cut off from rest.’

Eric Wormald then described how he was captured and taken to a Prisoner of War camp, surviving on little food and celebrating his birthday while imprisoned.

‘July 4 being my 36th birthday and a POW in Germany,’ he continued. ‘July 16 received first Red and parcel. July 21 comfort parcel. Allowed to send card home.

‘August 3 left Stalag 12A by train and arrived Stalag 4B. August 5. While there I wrote a number of cards home and we could get news every day about the war.’

He added: ‘Started work in stone quarry on 11th. Damned hard job and little food. First pay 25 Marks per month. Received first letter from home on October 25.

‘Nothing much to write about, time is going quick, only work and sleep. Don’t get much news now, letters arriving better but no parcels coming through.

‘Xmas day was lousy. New Year’s Day just as bad, very cold but not much snow. Jan, still looking forward to finish of war. Feb, we all hope that this month will see it through.

‘Some news that the war is progressing in our favour. Air raids getting more frequent. March, weather much better, still no sign of war being finished. No letters for three weeks, not much special news.

‘April, another weary month, all work and no play. Everyone feeling very weak through lack of food. News that the Yanks are advancing fast.’

In the last paragraphs, he tells of liberation. ‘Handed over next morning and taken to X POW camp. Plenty of food and news. There two weeks and left by truck for Halle. Left Halle by plane.’
