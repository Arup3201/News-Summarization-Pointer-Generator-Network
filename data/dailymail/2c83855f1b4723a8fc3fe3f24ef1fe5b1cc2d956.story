We’re a week on now from the accident that left a cricketer dead and a sport in mourning.

It’s too early to know what happens next. Emotions are raw, and the uncertainty over the dates for the Australia-India series reflected the sense that the sport had to go on – though no one could really say quite how, where or when.

Playing cricket feels like an utterly inadequate response to the death of Phillip Hughes. But it also feels like the only response. There are no answers lurking within the next batch of runs or wickets. Perhaps there is a little solace.

Cricket has stared deep into its own soul these past few days and been confused by what it has seen. Are helmets safe? Should we ban the bouncer? How can an innings end like this?

The idea that reality has intruded on the idyll has been disquieting – though there has rarely been anything idyllic about standing 20 yards away from a man hurling a hard ball at you.

As if to remind us that cricket can be perilous, the Hughes tragedy was followed quickly by the death of Hillel Oscar, an Israeli umpire who was struck in the neck out in the middle. Truly, the cosmos is in a dark mood.

What can cricket do, if it can do anything at all?

It can accept, finally, that it is only a game, not a higher calling, not a test of manhood, not a cookie jar for the spivs and the suits.

It can cling on to, and bottle, the sense of togetherness that might just have helped those who knew Hughes best make some sense of their loss.

Without realising it, we may even have stumbled across a convincing definition of cricket’s fabled spirit. Though cricket told itself otherwise, it never was a question of whether a bowler runs out a batsman for backing up too far, or a fielder claims a catch on the bounce.

It was always about the sense of community, from Manchester via Multan to Macksville. Even as cricket sheds tears, it has grown stronger.

Above all, it can help us to be kinder. When Pakistan’s Asad Shafiq was dismissed for a carefree but futile 137 on the final afternoon of the Sharjah Test on Sunday, New Zealand’s Kane Williamson ran 30 or 40 yards to shake his hand. Throughout that Test, wickets and hundreds inspired only muted celebrations.

The tragic context should not distract us from the gut feeling that cricket is a better sport when it is played like this. Mutual respect can extend beyond the days of grief.

Here in Sri Lanka, we’re all doing our best to get worked up about another one-day blowout by England, but hearts are not in it. To judge from his demeanour about the place, Alastair Cook – an old hand at smiling politely in the face of vitriol – is being true to the words he spoke ahead of last Saturday’s game in Colombo.

Talking on the morning after Hughes’s death, Cook said: ‘What’s happened in the last three days has certainly clarified in my mind that’s it just a game of sport. We are incredibly lucky to play the game. But it’s just a game of sport. We have a massive responsibility to play it the right way.’

Cook shouldn’t be in England’s one-day team, let alone captaining it. But he’s got his priorities right, and it’s hard not to like him for that. (Incidentally, it has been suggested that Cook used Hughes’s death as some kind of excuse for England’s performance on Saturday. He absolutely did not.)

Cricket’s task, too, is to get its priorities right. It doesn’t matter enough for grown men to be snarling at each other, but it does matter enough for our administrators to get their act together.

The sport needs cherishing and protecting, and it ought to start immediately. Phillip Hughes is no more. But his legacy can last for ever. 

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

All hail the Kiwis… 

Brendon McCullum said he felt 'pretty empty' after steering New Zealand to a famous win in Sharjah over the weekend: events elsewhere had put the third Test against Pakistan into its proper perspective.

But no-one would begrudge him some quiet satisfaction about the progress his side have made. Their 1-1 draw in the UAE – in a country where both England and Australia have been thrashed – means New Zealand are unbeaten in five Test series stretching back to their loss in England in 2013.

Almost as startling, they are now only a couple of points away from relegating India to seventh in the ICC rankings. Compare and contrast the raw cricketing materials at the disposal of those two nations, and you get sense of New Zealand’s achievement. They have become one of the most watchable sides in the game.

… and their captain 

A fair chunk of this is down to McCullum himself. This year alone, he has compiled Test scores of 224, 302 (both against India) and 202. He has done it while shifting between the middle order and the opener’s role, and while reinventing himself as a cover fielder. Gloriously, his fourth-best Test score in 2014 is 45. It may just be the most ruthless conversion-rate in history.

Nothing to see here: Pt XXVIII  

As the lawyers of ICC chairman N Srinivasan continue to fight for their client’s reputation in India’s Supreme Court, it was instructive to learn of Srini’s thoughts on the investigation into corruption at the 2013 IPL and the inner workings of Indian cricket.

Asked if he felt this long-running fiasco had affected the image of the sport in India, the man formerly known as the president of the BCCI is reported to have said: ‘I don’t agree that Indian cricket is taking a hit, I am not able to share your sentiments on that.’

What, one wonders, constitutes a ‘hit’ in the weird and wonderful world of Narayanaswami Srinivasan? 

RIP Phillip Hughes 

I only interviewed him once, on a quiet morning at The Oval in 2009, the day after he had made 195 for Middlesex against Surrey in the Championship. The game was still going on, and later that day Hughes would hit 57 off 46 balls. Middlesex finished nine down and two runs short of their target of 186 in 25 overs. He was the talk of the town.

Hughes didn’t have to turn up early to chat to a journalist he’d never met, especially in the middle of a game. But he was there at the appointed time. English cricketers can be guilty of over-analysis. It struck me there was little danger of Hughes doing the same.

‘There’s been a fair bit of talk about my technique, but I just want to stick to my own gameplan,’ he said, as if the alternative would have been an affront. ‘It’s how I play. Everyone has their own style and that’s something I just want to keep going. Sure, bowlers will have their plans, but you can look at it in two different ways: I have my plans too. We’ll just go from there.’ 

In five innings for Middlesex that summer before he joined the Ashes tour, Hughes scored 574 runs at an average of 143. People were scoffing at his technique, but he did it his way and appeared to love every minute. There’s a lesson in there somewhere.
