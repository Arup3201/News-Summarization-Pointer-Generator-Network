Ukip today confirmed its controversial MEP Roger Helmer will fight the upcoming Newark by-election for the party - despite recent controversy over a series of remarks about homosexuality.

Mr Helmer sparked outrage in 2012 after likening gay marriage to incest.

The 70-year-old has also claimed people should be able to prefer being straight to being gay - like some people prefer Earl Grey to ordinary tea.

Roger Helmer has rarely avoided controversy during his career as an MEP, but has been returned to Brussels three times

And in 2000 he said being gay is ‘not worthy of valid equal respect’.

Mr Helmer's selection comes after Ukip leader Nigel Farage ducked the chance to fight the Nottinghamshire seat.

The byelection was called after the disgraced former Tory MP Patrick Mercer resigned in the wake of a cash-for-questions scandal.

Mr Helmer was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 as the Tory MEP for the East Midlands - and re-elected in 2004 and 2009 - before defecting to Ukip in March 2012.

His outspoken views have caused controversy throughout his career and last year even Mr Farage said he had gone 'too far' with his attack on gay marriage.

In 2012 Mr Helmer said: 'If two men have a right to marry, how can we deny the same right to two siblings? Are we to authorise incest?'

His made the bombshell remarks in a pamphlet entitled 'Straight Talking on Europe'.

Nigel Farage decided not to fight the Newark by-election - leaving himself open to accusations that he 'bottled' his big chance

The year before he asked: 'Why is it OK for a surgeon to perform a sex-change operation, but not OK for a psychiatrist to try to "turn" a consenting homosexual?'

Mr Helmer has also dismissed homophobia as a 'weasel word'. He said: 'The homosexual lobby is not content with decriminalisation. It wants to be accepted as a "valid alternative lifestyle".

'But it is not a valid lifestyle worthy of equal respect.

'At the risk of offending the politically correct, I will argue that homosexual behaviour is abnormal and undesirable.'

He previously questioned the existence of 'homophobia', saying some people found gay relationships 'distasteful if not viscerally repugnant'.

He defended the remarks, saying: 'Different people have different tastes. You may tell me you don't like Earl Grey tea. That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you don't like it.

The Ukip candidate added: 'I simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences.

'It is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality, or vice versa. Most of us prefer one or the other.'

He later added: 'I said that people may prefer heterosexuality or homosexuality. I did not say that people could dislike – much less hate – other people on the grounds of their sexual orientation.

'The mainstream media are engaged in a feeding frenzy against Ukip, and are prepared to twist the facts to suit their agenda.'

Mr Helmer also insists that he has condemned homophobia during his career.

He said 'prejudice, hostility and violence against homosexuals are wrong and totally unacceptable'.

But Mr Helmer's controversial views are not restricted to homosexuality.

He has claimed that women who are date raped must ‘share part of the responsibility’.

Mr Helmer said in 'stranger rape' the blame was 'squarely on the perpetrator' but in date rape cases 'the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend’s mind'.

The outspoken MEP has also claimed the Catholic Church was ‘systematically paedophilic’.  

He said: ‘So far as I know it has no rules or systems designed to support or promote paedophilia.

'But I think it would be perfectly fair to describe it as systemically paedophile.’

Despite Mr Helmer's controversial past, he was 'overwhelmingly' endorsed by the Newark constituency association at a hustings meeting on Monday before being backed by Ukip's National Executive Committee, a party spokesman said.

Mr Helmer said: 'I am both proud and humbled to have been selected by the constituency association in Newark to represent the UKIP cause in this historic town in what could well prove to be an historic by-election.'

'It would be a huge honour to be elected to serve as Newark’s MP and I will be giving my all over the next few weeks to achieve that outcome.'

Mr Farage said: 'He is a massively experienced and respected figure on the national political stage and on the local political stage as well.

'I know that the Ukip membership will rally to the cause of making Roger our first directly elected MP.'

The Newark by-election is scheduled to take place on June 5, with the Conservatives selecting Robert Jenrick to run and Labour represented by Michael Payne. The Lib Dems are expected to choose a candidate in the coming days.
