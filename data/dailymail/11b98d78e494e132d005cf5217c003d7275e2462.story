Pittsburgh officials warned of a public health crisis Sunday after a week in which 17 people died of overdoses on an unusually potent form of heroin.

Three were declared dead Sunday morning alone from apparent heroin overdoses in Allegheny County and officials warn the situation now looks startlingly like the crisis of 1988 when 18 Pittsburghers were killed by a powerful synthetic heroin called China White.

Many of those who died in the last week possessed heroin bags marked 'Theraflu' and subsequent tests revealed they contained a drug 100 times more powerful than morphine called fentanyl.

Crisis: Officials say they've found these heroin bags stamped 'Theraflu' in possession of some of the over a dozen dead drug users who've died in the past week

'The fentanyl we're seeing as a powder has to be made by somebody,' Allegheny County medical examiner Dr. Karl Williams told ABC News. 'Somebody is making this somewhere in a clandestine laboratory.'

Fentanyl is manufactured as a legal pain killer, but authorities suspect the fentanyl that laced the heroin was made in an illegal lab 'by some clever chemists.'

Allegheny county sees about one overdose case per day, Williams said. What's happened in the past week is extremely out of the ordinary.

'We usually deal with 250 drug overdoses a year so what’s going on is really significant,' he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Fentanyl resembles heroin, though it is much more potent, and it has been blamed for dozens of deaths around the U.S.

Been here before? Found in some of the Theraflu bags was the super-potent narcotic Theraflu, which officials like Allegheny County medical examiner Dr. Karl Williams (right) says makes the recent rash of deaths eerily similar to the 1988 China White epidemic

China White: In 1988, 18 were killed in the Pittsburgh area by a drug called 3-methylfentanyl, a sort of synthetic heroin with the street name China White

Each of the people who died in the rash of overdoses has a known history of drug abuse, particularly heroin, Williams said.

Deaths also have been reported in Westmoreland County, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto’s office said.

The area has seen periodic rises in the overdose rate, notably in 1988 when a potent chemical called 3-methylfentanyl, AKA China White, was introduced to heroin users in the area, killing 18 of them.

It remains to be seen if each of the recent victims died due to heroin laced with fentanyl.

'I don’t know yet what we’ll find in the bodies of these people,' Williams said, though something is clearly out there causing the steep rise in heroin-related deaths.

'We’re obviously dealing with a major public health crisis,' he said, something 'bringing to mind the very localized China White epidemic we had in 1988.'
