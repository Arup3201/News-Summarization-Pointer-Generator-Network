It's not nice to think that you'll ever be in an emergency situation and will need to call for help, but a new app is at least making this scenario a little less terrifying.

Eye-on-me has been designed to alert friends if you're in trouble, effectively turning your smartphone into a panic button.

Once an alarm is set, a large trigger button is placed on the phone's homescreen and when pressed, it automatically emails alert messages to friends and family asking for help.

Once an alarm is set, a large trigger button is placed on the homescreen and in an emergency, tapping the button sends an alert to friends, pictured left. Each alert is sent with location details and users are tracked on a map, pictured right. The alarm can also be triggered if the phone is shaken hard

Once an alarm is set, a large trigger button is placed on the phone's homescreen.

Tapping the button sends an alert to pre-selected friends via email.

A second tap posts the alert to Facebook and Twitter, while a third and fourth opens the camera and takes photos.

Each alert is sent with location details and users are tracked on a map.

The app also gives the option to set a 
deactivation code that switches off the alarm, and sends another message
 to friends informing them the user is okay.

The personalised message also contains the user’s exact location that can be tracked on a map.

By tapping the icon a second time, the alert is automatically posted to connected Facebook and Twitter accounts.

A third tap opens the camera, a fourth takes a photo and a fifth tap uploads the photo of your attacker or surroundings to social networks. 

Once the alarm is triggered, the icon flashes silently and it can also be triggered if the phone is shaken hard.

The app also gives the option to set a deactivation code that switches off the alarm, and sends another message to friends informing them the user is okay and safe again. 

By tapping the icon a second time,  the alert is posted to Facebook and Twitter. A third tap opens the camera, a fourth takes a photo and a fifth uploads the photo to social networks. If a friend triggers the alarm, the app additionally lets users coordinate a rescue, pictured right, without having to swap phone numbers

Alternatively, the alarm can be turned off, but the tracking options remain switched on.

Users select which of their friends can ‘follow’ them, and receive alerts. They can also request to follow their friends and family, and every registered follower is stored in the Settings menu.

However, people don’t need to install the app to follow others as the requests are sent via email.

The app is also useful for parents who want to track their children, for example.

If a friend triggers the alarm, the Eye-on-me safety app additionally has a messaging tool that lets users text each other and co-ordinate a rescue without having to swap phone numbers.

The Eye-on-me personal safety app is out now and is free until end of May, after which is it will cost 65pn ($1).

There are also other safety apps on the market including Big Red Button, It is a personal emergency support service accessed via a mobile.

Pressing the Big Red Button connects users with a 24-hour helpline with trained staff to offer reassurance, support and, if necessary, an emergency response. It also sends the staff the user's location using GPS. 

Meanwhile, the Hot Phone app calls for help when the handset is shaken. 

It sends the user's geo-location or map position by text to a contact and this message is updated at five minute intervals. The recipient can click on the link in the text and see where the person is.
