It is the most expensive Wish You Were Here? postcard in history.

These incredible images show the craggy mountainside where Curiosity, Nasa’s £1.6billion planetary explorer, hopes to discover signs that life once existed on Mars.

The six-wheeled rover, which landed earlier this month, will edge its way to the foot of the mountain, 6.2 miles away, to scratch around in the dirt, dust and soil.

In Curiosity's second drive, it 
rotated about 90 degrees, drove about 16 feet (5 meters), then rotated 
back about 120 degrees to face roughly the same direction from which it 
started.

Nasa officials said it placed Curiosity directly over a patch where one of the 
spacecraft’s landing engines scoured away a few inches of gravelly soil 
and exposed underlying rock.

Researchers plan to use a 
neutron-shooting instrument on the rover to check for water molecules 
bound into minerals at this partially excavated target, they said.

Chemical analysis of those samples 
should reveal whether Mars ever had the organic materials that could 
support life and may help answer one of the greatest questions of 
science: is life unique to Earth or did it once exist elsewhere in the 
Solar System?

Science fiction writers have 
speculated about intelligent Martians since Victorian times. However, 
scientists now  suspect that the Red Planet is dead – but that it may 
once have been home to alien bacteria or moss.

Bugs and moss might not sound like 
intelligent little green men, but their one-time presence would mean 
that life has evolved – or  been deposited by comets or  asteroids – on 
two of the eight  planets of our Solar System.

And if life is relatively common in our small corner of the galaxy, then surely the universe must be teeming with it.

The latest images are the most 
detailed yet from the nuclear- powered 2,000lb Curiosity, which landed 
in the Gale Crater, south of Mars’s equator.

They show layers of rocks – similar 
to the red and grey tiers of the Grand Canyon in Arizona in the US – 
near the base of the three-mile-high Mount Sharp at the centre of the 
96-mile-wide crater.

The colour of one of the images – 
taken by Curiosity’s 100mm  telephoto camera, one of 17 on board – is 
enhanced to show the scene under the same lighting conditions here on 
Earth, which helps scientists to analyse the terrain.

Previous surveys of Mars have shown the layers contain clays  and other minerals that usually form in the presence of water.

Although Mars is now a desert planet, millions of years ago its surface was carved by oceans, lakes and waterfalls.

The gravelly land in the foreground 
of the main picture is the landing area, named Bradbury Landing in 
tribute to the American science fiction writer, Ray Bradbury, who died 
in June.

The ground eventually rises up to the
edge of a crater, behind which lies a field of darker dunes leading up 
to the bottom of Mount Sharp.

NASA Administrator Charles Bolden also had a recorded speech played from the rover on the surface of Mars.

He said: 'The knowledge we hope to gain from our observation and analysis of Gale Crater will tell us much about the possibility of life on Mars as well as the past and future possibilities for our own planet.

'Curiosity will bring benefits to Earth and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers, as it prepares the way for a human mission in the not too distant future.'

The peak of the mountain is ten miles
away. What has intrigued Nasa about these pictures is the peculiar 
nature of the layers of rock on the mountainside.Although those near the crater floor 
are horizontal, the ones  higher up have been twisted by geological 
forces over millions of years and are sharply inclined – exactly the 
reverse of similar features found on Earth.

In the Grand Canyon, for instance, 
the rock layers near the bottom have been buckled and tilted by the 
movement of the Earth’s tectonic plates. But the more recent layers on 
top are horizontal.

The difference on Mars suggests layers of rock were deposited quickly by violent winds or currents.

As well as the surprising tilt of the
Martian rocks, their composition has intrigued scientists who plan to 
use the rover’s array of gadgets to seek out signs of past, or current, 
life in the layers of rock.

Among these are the ChemCam, which uses a laser to vaporise soil and rock samples before analysing their chemical make-up.

However, anyone hoping for a quick 
answer to the question of life will be disappointed. For the rover will 
take nearly a year to trundle over to the mountainside.

Eventually, Nasa wants to send a manned mission and its publicity machine is eager to whip up enthusiasm for all things Mars.

That explains why yesterday, at 9pm, 
the space agency was preparing to broadcast a new track by Black Eyed 
Peas singer Will.i.am from the rover.

It was – Nasa informed the world – the first time a pop song has been broadcast on another planet.

What any hiding Martians will think, heaven knows. Let’s just hope they don’t mistake it for a declaration of war.

Nasa also released a new colour panorama showing a 360-degree view of Curiosity's landing site, including the highest part of Mount Sharp visible to the rover
