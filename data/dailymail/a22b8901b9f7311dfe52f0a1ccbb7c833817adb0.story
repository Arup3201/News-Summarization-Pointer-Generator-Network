The incident took place last October and was caught on a surveillance camera inside the parking garage at the Hillsborough County Jail.

Hogtied: Van Treese restrain the homeless woman's legs and cuffed her arms in what is known as Total Appendage Restraint Position after she resisted arrest

The woman, 36-year-old Sonja Mimmenger, has her hands and feet restrained, and she is seen lying flat on her stomach with her legs bent at the knees, Tampa Bay Times reported.

Van Treese takes off the suspect's restrains and attempts to get her to stand up, but Mimmenger collapses to the floor.

The officer is then seen hauling the woman away by dragging her on the floor by her left bicep.

According to a police report, Mimmenger, who has a lengthy criminal record, was arrested on charges of cocaine possession, trespassing and obstructing or opposing an officer without violence.

The police department conducted an internal affairs investigation, which found that Van Treese ‘should have used better judgement’ in handling an uncooperative suspect. The officer received a written reprimand for his conduct. 

In the wake of the October 5, 2013, incident, the Tampa Police Department revised its policy of handling passively resisting suspects, requiring the presence of two officers.

Her version of events: Mimmenger later explained that she was unable to stand up on her own because her legs hurt from being restrained in the back of the police cruiser

According to the police probe, on October 5, Van Treese and another officer spotted Mimmenger, who is homeless, on the porch of a blighted house notorious for drug and gambling activities.

The 36-year-old woman, who has had nearly 80 run-ins with local police and 15 convictions, resisted arrest, prompting Van Treese to restrain her legs, cuff her arms and put her in the police cruiser on her stomach in what is known as Total Appendage Restraint Position.

The woman was reportedly not injured after being dragged on the floor by Van Treese. She was taken to a hospital as a precaution, where she allegedly informed a nurse that she did not require medical attention.

The woman then jumped off a gurney to prove that she was fine before being released. She was eventually sentenced to 90 days in jail.

Aftermath: Van Treese was reprimanded by the department, while Mimmenger was sentenced to 90 days in jail for cocaine possession and trespassing -

When interviewed about the incident by Fox 13, Mimmenger said that the arresting officer dragged her ‘like a little rag muffin.’

The woman explained that she could not walk on her own because her legs hurt from being restrained during the 10-15 minute ride to jail.

'I had never been hogtied before,' she said.

Mimmenger added that being dragged off by a police officer like that showed a lack of respect on his part and made her feel like she 'didn’t have much to live for.’
