A television advert for E45 cream has been scrapped after The Mail on Sunday last week highlighted complaints that it trivialised drug abuse.

Reckitt Benckiser, the British manufacturer of the cream, which is the biggest-selling product of its kind in the UK, has apologised for the offence caused by the 40-second commercial.

The advert, which appeared to echo previous Government anti-drug campaigns, featured a thin, pale-looking woman sitting on a chair in a darkened room and anxiously rubbing her arms.

Bad taste: The new E45 advert has been pulled after getting complaints as it parodied drug addiction, as the girl confesses that she is 'hooked' on it

She said: ‘It all started with a small dose .  .  . It affected how I looked and how I felt. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.’

In the last seconds of the advert, she livens up and begins talking about the product, which is used by former X Factor star Cheryl Cole.

She is shown applying it to her arms, before saying: ‘It was the perfect daily moisturiser. It’s so light and smells great .  .  . I was hooked.’

The last shot shows samples of the cream, which retails for about £5.49, and the slogan: ‘You’ll be hooked.’

The advert was pulled hours after we revealed it had prompted more than 60 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority as well as criticism on social networking sites, including Twitter.

Trivial: Viewers complained about the advert as being 'offensive' to people struggling with addiction

One person wrote: ‘What idiot decided that likening E45 to being a drug addict was good marketing? Disgusting!!’

Another added: ‘What completely misjudged, misguided ad content from E45 cream.’

A third viewer Tweeted: ‘Comparing moisturising lotion to serious drug addiction? Big NO.’

Drug charities were among those who said the advert trivialised the problems facing addicts.

A spokeswoman for E45 said the company was sorry for any offence caused and insisted it had not gone out of its way to court controversy.

‘We were unaware anyone had complained to the ASA until we saw it in The Mail on Sunday,’ she said.

‘E45 is not a brand that sets out to shock.’
