As Burberry today unveils its new spring/summer campaign in store windows and across social media networking sites, millions of ardent fans will be watching.

Just last month, it was announced that the British company had become the world's most successful  luxury fashion brand on Facebook and Twitter, with a record 10million fans on Facebook, and almost 700,000 following the brand's regular UK feed on Twitter.

Meanwhile, they have thousands more global Twitter fans following their international feeds and post exclusive content on their own YouTube channel.

Burberry's social media success has grown exponentially - and it is still growing fast.

The secret, say consumer experts, is the fact that Burberry share so much unique content exclusively with their followers on social networking platforms, and post new and different content to each one. What is posted on Facebook will be different from that on Twitter, and dialogues are constantly being carried out across both.

Just this morning, Burberry placed 
three new videos from their latest campaign, starring My Week With 
Marilyn star Eddie Redmayne and Cara Delevingne, onto their YouTube channel.

And at the news that the brand had 
reached 10million Facebook fans, Burberry Chief Creative Officer Christopher 
Bailey uploaded a personal thank you via a video message to the site. Days later, a further 163,000 had joined.

All this direct contact gives fans that bit more involvement with the brand - and keeps them connected.

'Christopher is really involved,' 
Burberry told MailOnline. 'He has answered fans' questions personally on
Facebook, and he's very active on Twitter.'

'It gives people something new. It's a direct and personal route for them.'

Their groundbreaking, inclusive 
approach goes against the practiced elitism of luxury brands, and ultimately brings 
fans closer rather than keeping them at a distance.

While other fashion houses operate 
strict closed-door policies that isolate all but the inner circle - Tom 
Ford famously showed his last collection to a tiny selection of invited 
contacts, with no photographers and only a handful of select Press allowed - Burberry have 
embraced this public approach. 

Indeed, Burberry was the world's first 
fashion house to 'Tweettalk', posting images from its autumn/winter fashion show on to 
Twitter - 
before the models had even stepped out onto the catwalk.

The innovative move meant fans 
were able to see the collection before the celebrity front row and the 
fashion Press had even caught a glimpse.

For his part, current star of the 
campaign Eddie Redmayne reports that Christopher Bailey is, as one would
expect from his democratic approach to business, a 'gem of a man'

'I am a huge fan of Christopher Bailey,' he says. 'He is a brilliant designer and a brilliant man.

'The fashion world can be a tad intimidating but Christopher remains a kind, grounded gem of a man.

And judging by the latest figures, there are at least 10 million people out there who agree.

Social media success story: Burberry has over 10m Facebook fans - and counting

About the videos, Bailey says: 'We wanted to capture a moment in the lives of two exciting and inspiring British actors who have been part of the Burberry family for several years.

'The images reflect the mood of the collection through Eddie's and Cara's energy, playfulness and effortless elegance and I have such huge admiration for them both.'
