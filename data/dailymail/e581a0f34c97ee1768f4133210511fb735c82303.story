Graeme Souness has insisted Rangers would be a stronger, healthier club if Brian Kennedy had won the keys to Ibrox.

The former boss of the Govan club was involved in two separate power bids by the Sale Sharks owner — the most recent the offer of a last-ditch loan two weeks ago.

Angered by the demise of the side he managed between 1986 and 1991, Souness is unable to disguise his contempt for Charles Green, despite a late-night attempt by the Yorkshireman to sign him up for his own takeover group in 2012.

‘What is it? Two years since that p**** had it?’ said Souness.

‘The guy who knocked on my door one night asking me if I would get involved in it with him. Charles Green.

‘It was late one night about 11 o’clock, my answer was no.

‘I got a phonecall about an hour before that he was coming to see me. I had been asked to see him and I had refused. 

‘We went for a cup of tea at a hotel around the corner.

'You’ve got me angry now…’

A personal friend of Kennedy, Souness was keen to return to Ibrox with Walter Smith in the event of the Edinburgh-born businessman securing the assets in 2012.

He was also on board when Cheshire-based Kennedy offered a £3million loan to the Rangers board as an alternative to MASH, Mike Ashley’s investment group.

‘I had a week with Brian in Majorca three weeks ago,’ Souness revealed. ‘But if it’s not to be, it’s not to be.

‘When we met we never went into detail because, the last time, we believed we had it. Brian believed he had it - only to be let down and deeply disappointed. We even came up to watch a Rangers and Celtic game because we believed we had it.

‘I think this time around he was always thinking the worst.

‘Given the structure the way it is now, I would think that’s it finished.

‘I don’t know how Brian feels right now but I think his attitude to it has changed now the other folk are involved.’

Asked how he feels about the ongoing financial turmoil at the club, Souness claims anger barely covers it.

‘That’s not the correct word. I’m angry about it and saddened by it in equal amounts because a lot has been allowed to happen.

‘I don’t want to get into being involved in a libel case.

‘All I would say is that if we had got it, the people there would have had the club for the right reasons.’

Asked for his views on Newcastle United owner Ashley’s tightening grip on the club following the appointment of henchmen Derek Llambias and Barry Leach to the board, Souness said: ‘I don’t want to end up in court.

‘I wouldn’t be critical of Mike Ashley. He is a fantastic businessman who saw an opportunity at Newcastle and it’s very hard to be critical, having worked there myself.

‘I think he has done the right thing there.

‘He has stuck with his manager and it looks like he is getting the rewards of that. That’s what it needed.

‘It needs a strong owner and that’s what he is. Someone who has been supremely successful in anything he has touched.

‘I think in terms of Newcastle supporters, they should be counting their blessings rather than being critical.

‘Now if he came to Rangers and was to plough a shedload of money in there, everyone would be happy - but I don’t see that happening.’

As a result of the Rangers meltdown and the subsequent fall-out Souness – who enjoyed huge resources as manager - fears Scottish football has fallen off a financial cliff and may not recover.

‘All I would say is that all the people who enjoyed their demise, if they had their time again, would they have voted the same way?

‘Celtic getting gates of less than 20,000? I think it has damaged football, hopefully not beyond repair.

‘Football goes in cycles. Over a 10-year period, they say if you lose a support, it’s very hard to get that back.

‘I don’t know if it will get back.

‘Rangers will get back to the SPL, the Old Firm games will be enormous affairs again and the passion will remain the same.

‘But will it ever get back to where it was six or seven years ago? I very much doubt it.’
