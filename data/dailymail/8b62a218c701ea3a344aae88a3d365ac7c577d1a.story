Their icy-looking rings and fiery array of colors look like scientists have discovered new additions to the solar system.

Yet the intricate and other-worldly detail belongs to something a bit closer to home - a golf ball.

The unexpected bright centers found in something quite mundane have been documented by photographer James Friedman.

Despite the rings of color, this is the inside of a golf ball and not a new planetary discovery

Photographer James Friedman decided to slice his golf ball collection in half to see what lies beneath

The core of a golf ball affects how quickly it spins and how far it will fly through the air

Sheer curiosity led him to cut his golf ball collection in half to see what was inside.

Beneath the dimples lies the core of the ball, made from dough, which affects how quickly it spins and how far it can fly.

There are strict rules on how golf balls are made, set by the R&A, based at the world's oldest golf club in St Andrews, Scotland, and they must not be heavier than 1.62oz.

The dough, usually made from about a dozen raw ingredients, is color-coded depending on its intended effects on a golfer's game.

Despite his collection, Mr Friedman, from Columbus, Ohio, is not a golfer himself.

Not every golf ball has a colorful interior, with some looking more futuristic than their bright counterparts

The golf ball project made photographer James Friedman more excited about taking abstract pictures alongside his documentary work

Friedman was delighted to find 'elegant formal qualities' in the most mundane of places - inside a golf ball

Beneath their plain exteriors, there's a riot of color to be found and each color stands for a different impact

Instead his pictures, which appear under the title Interior Design, have given him a new appreciation of photography beyond his award-winning real-life work.

Mr Friedman, who gained his master's degree at San Francisco State University, said: 'To my surprise, 
what I found inside inspired me to consider that I could discover, in 
the unlikeliest of places, elegant formal qualities and surprising 
metaphorical possibilities.

'Interior Design has moved me to be 
enthusiastic about abstraction, an exciting corollary to my work as a 
documentary photographer.'

They're small and lightweight but the core of a golf ball can have a significant impact on a golfer's game
