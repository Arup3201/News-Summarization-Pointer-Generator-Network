When asked about when his captain's contract situation would be sorted on Tuesday, Mourinho said: 'Yes, it will be before the end of the season for sure.

'What I can guarantee is he will be a Chelsea player next season. I can guarantee that.

'To guarantee that, it's because I know what my board tell me and what the player tells me. No doubts he is going to get his contract, no doubts. I think it's around that (terms agreed but not signed).'

Mourinho's words come after Terry spoke out following the Capital One Cup final about his bid to earn a new deal at Stamford Bridge.

Mourinho was certain that Terry was going to be part of his squad for the 2015-16 Premier League season

Terry scored Chelsea's opener at Wembley and then held firm in defence as the Blues ran out 2-0 winners over Tottenham and afterwards he revealed his inspiration came from trying to prove people wrong who had written him off.

'I am fighting for myself and my family, and to prove people wrong,' he said. 'It doesn't come much bigger than that. I want to give it everything. 

'I don't know how long I have left. Hopefully I have a few years left but if this is my last year then I hope it will go out on a bang.

The Chelsea boss could bring Kurt Zouma into midfield again in the absence of Nemanja Matic

It looks like Mourinho and Terry will be spending at least another year together at Stamford Bridge

'I have my little target to play next year but beyond that, two or three years (more), I don't know.'

Mourinho refused to confirm whether Kurt Zouma would again start in midfield against West Ham on Wednesday with Nemanja Matic and John Obi Mikel both still out through suspension and injury respectively.

'I don't play same team (as at Wembley), that's for sure,' Mourinho said. 'He (Zouma) is not a midfield player. He is not going to be a midfielder. That is completely clear. It's not his future.

'But the team is better when you know the qualities of everybody, when you know everybody can be extra in some details, and if Zouma couldn't do that for us on that day, we would have been in trouble.'
