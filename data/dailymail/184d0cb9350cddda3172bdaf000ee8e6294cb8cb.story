As reforms to legal aid come into force today, people who represent themselves in court have been told not to behave like TV's fast-talking lawyer Ally McBeal (above)

As reforms to legal aid come into force today, people who represent themselves in court have been told not to behave like TV's fast-talking lawyer Ally McBeal.

The advice forms part of a layman's guide to courtroom etiquette, issued by the Bar Council - and includes handy tips such as: 'You might be tempted to speak like lawyers on TV. Resist the temptation.

'Lawyers do not really speak like that. Some bad lawyers do, but judges hate it.'

It comes as legal aid will no longer
be available for whole classes of compensation claims, including those 
made over medical negligence, personal injury and employment law.

Taxpayer support will also be withdrawn from many family law, education, immigration, debt, housing and benefit disputes.

Other advice offered in the booklet, A Guide To Representing Yourself In Court, states: 'Make sure you speak loudly, slowly and clearly,' according to the Independent.

The manual, which will be distributed to all MPs in England and Wales, also suggests you dress smartly and turn up early.

The 74-page 'idiot's guide', put together by top barristers, adds: 'Make sure you know what you're supposed to be calling the judge and whether you are supposed to stand up every time you speak (ask the usher beforehand if you are unsure).

'If you cannot find the usher, just say "Sir" or "Madam".'

Another vital pointer says: 'Always be completely honest with the judge and with any officials.

'There can be very serious consequences if you deliberately lie or even bend the truth.'

The reforms to the Legal Aid, 
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo) come into immediate 
effect as the Government moves to reduce its £2.2billion legal aid
bill by £350million.

Private family law, such as divorce and custody
battles, personal injury cases, some employment and education law, 
immigration cases where the person is not detained and some debt, 
housing and benefit issues will all be impacted.

Some law firms estimate the reforms 
will reduce the number of people who qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent, 
meaning around 200,000 fewer cases, while barristers have warned the 
cuts are the biggest to civil legal aid since the system was introduced 
in 1949.

And to assist those representing themselves in a civil action, the guide also offers help on how to put together your own case, deal with specific areas of law and defend a claim.

The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, warned that 'people could start taking the law into their own hands as a result of an inability to seek justice following the Government's civil legal aid cuts'.

Richard Miller, head of Legal Aid at the Law Society, said: 'We have warned Government consistently that, as well as all the knock-on costs, the social consequences will be damaging to the whole of society, not just the vulnerable who will take the worst hit of all.'

The Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said 'vulnerable people will suffer' as a result of the changes.

Maura McGowan QC, chair of the Bar Council, said: 'As a result of Laspo, more people than ever before will find themselves going to court without legal representation.

'It is not just the view of the Bar - the Judiciary, the broader legal profession and legal advice centres are all saying the same thing.

'We are faced with a situation whereby access to justice is no longer being adequately funded and vulnerable people will suffer.'

Cases that will continue to receive funding include family law cases involving domestic violence, forced marriage or child abduction issues, mental health cases, asylum and debt and housing matters where someone's home is at immediate risk.

The changes have prompted a raft of warnings from law firms across the country.

The removal of legal aid for divorce cases will hit the UK's poorest households almost three times harder than people in the richest parts of the country, according to research by family law firm Stephensons.

The average cost of a divorce is £1,300 or 9 per cent of the average yearly income in Dwyfor Meirionnydd in North Wales, the UK constituency with the lowest average salary, Stephensons said.

By contrast, £1,300 is equal to just 3.3 per cent of the average annual income in Westminster North, which has the UK's highest average salary.

Elsewhere, Quality Solicitors warned low-income parents may be left unable to afford necessary legal representation to secure contact rights with their children following divorce.

And Hugh James Solicitors argued that the number of individuals taking divorce and children cases to court as 'self representing litigants' as a result of the withdrawal of aid could burden the courts with more 'long-running and poorly organised cases'.

A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: 'We need to make sure taxpayers' money is not spent resolving too many disputes in court, when there are quicker, cheaper and less stressful options available.

'At £2 billion a year we have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world, and it's now costing taxpayers too much at time when resources are not limitless.

'We had to make some difficult decisions, and it was not a process we embarked on lightly, but we have safeguarded legal aid to ensure lawyers are there for those who really need them.'

'Taking the law into their own hands'

Last month, a senior judge was accused of meddling in politics after saying that legal aid cuts would bring lawlessness.

Lord Neuberger, the head of the country’s highest court, warned that stripping half a million Britons of the right to free lawyers would ‘lead to people taking the law into their own hands’.

He added that cuts to free legal advice and free courtroom lawyers would ‘start to undermine the rule of law’.

Criticising the judge’s remarks, Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘If the system of justice over which his lordship presides was not so inaccessible to my constituents, justice would be even-handed in the first place.

‘But the self-serving legal elite has made justice so expensive that the state has had to subsidise lawyers. Lord Neuberger should concentrate on providing cheaper justice and stop bellyaching.’

Criminologist Dr David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘It is inappropriate for the president of the Supreme Court to make such political comments.'

The judge’s remarks were a shot across the bows of Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who recently announced more legal aid reforms.

These will try to reduce the price of taxpayer-funded defence lawyers in criminal cases by making law firms submit competitive tenders for criminal legal aid work, so that solicitors and barristers would be forced to compete on price for work.

Tory and Labour governments and now the Coalition have all tried to reform legal aid since the 1980s, during which time taxpayer spending on lawyers’ bills has more than quadrupled to £2.1billion a year.

Official figures show that in the financial year to March 2011, six barristers each made more than £500,000 from criminal legal aid cases.

Another was paid more than £450,000 for civil legal aid cases.
