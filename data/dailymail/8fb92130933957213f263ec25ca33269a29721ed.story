Tropical 
heat being the theme of the week, it seems it is not only England’s 
footballers who can struggle in unfamiliar conditions. 

In
 the first match of the NBA play-off finals last week, the air 
conditioning at the AT&T Center, home of the San Antonio Spurs, 
broke down, leaving temperatures soaring. 

Miami Heat were seven points clear going into the fourth quarter, and lost by 15.

Exit: LeBron James withdrew from the first game of the NBA Finals after suffering cramp

Climate control: The air conditioning at San Antonio's AT&T Center gave way during game one if the Finals

This 
astonishing turnaround was blamed on the withdrawal of their brilliant 
power forward LeBron James with close to four minutes to go, 
suffering cramp caused by extreme dehydration. Miami lost the period in 
which he was out of the game 16-3.

As
 James is the most famous player in the world and is paid in excess of 
£10million annually, sympathy was in short supply. Pull yourself 
together and have a Gatorade, seemed to be the consensus opinion on 
social media, which was a little harsh if one considers his numbers.

Coming
 out of that match, in the past 11 seasons, James has played in 842 of 
886 regular season games (95 per cent) and all 154 post-season games. 
This equates to 996 of a possible 1,040 career appearances.

Response: James bounced back with a brilliant performance in game two of the series on Sunday

Showing his worth: The Heat superstar scored 35 points to help his team to a 98-96 victory

True
 to form, James was outstanding as Miami levelled the series on Sunday. 
Shut up, rather than man up, would appear to be the best advice from 
here.
