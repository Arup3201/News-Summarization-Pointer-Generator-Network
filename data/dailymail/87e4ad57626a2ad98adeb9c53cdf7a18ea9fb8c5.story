Daniel Sturridge is close to signing a new long-term deal that could net the Liverpool striker £150,000 per week. 

Sturridge, 25, who is recovering from a thigh problem and missed Wednesday night’s defeat in Basle, has been a huge success since joining 18 months ago.

He still has four years left on the terms that were agreed after his £12million arrival from Chelsea.

But Liverpool are ready to reward his progress — he has scored 36 goals in 52 games — with a new contract, which would be heavily incentivised on his performances and run to the summer of 2019.

Talks had been planned for the end of last season but were put on hold due to the World Cup. 

England manager Roy Hodgson has agreed not to pick Sturridge for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers — and so avoided a club v country row. 

Sturridge was injured in training for England earlier this month resulting in him missing the opening European Championship qualifier against Switzerland

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said after Wednesday night's defeat in Basle: ‘I’ve spoken to Roy today and he accepts that he (Sturridge) is not fit and he has to use the next two weeks to get fit for his club — which is the priority.’

Liverpool were bracing themselves for Sturridge to be selected on Thursday in the squad to face San Marino and Estonia, despite Rodgers warning that the 25-year-old will not be fit.

England’s medical staff spent time at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground with the club’s doctors on Monday assessing Sturridge’s injury ahead of the announcement.
