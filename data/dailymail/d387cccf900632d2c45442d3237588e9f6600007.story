A former police officer is being investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement after he allegedly used police resources to carry out an illicit affair.

Shaun Whiting quit his job at the Ocoee Police Department after his affair was discovered and before he could be disciplined.

The department now wants to revoke his certification to ensure he can never be a police officer in the state again.

On the job: Shaun Whiting carried out an affair with a married woman while on duty with the Ocoee police department

WFTV reports that Whiting, who is married, met the woman with whom he carried out the alleged affair during a call for service at a grocery store.

The two began communicating via email and cell phone.

The woman, also married, told police that she booked a hotel room and told Whiting to come while on duty.

He told her he needed to be accounted for, and instructed her to make a fake 911 call so that he could be dispatched to the hotel to investigate.

WFTV says the woman later requested a ride-along for the woman which was approved by the department.

The two ended up in a police substation where the woman performed a sex act on Whiting while he was in uniform and on duty.

New career: Investigators want to revoke his certification so that he can never be a police officer in Florida again

Whiting was a respected officer on the Ocoee force for four years before he resigned in disgrace to avoid the affair becoming public.

He is the father of two young children.

The affair was eventually exposed when the woman's husband discovered the betrayal and went to police.

The case will go before the Florida Department of Law Enforecement board in three weeks time.
