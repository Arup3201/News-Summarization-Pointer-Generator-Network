A woman has been left ‘gobsmacked’ after a camera, packed with memories of her once in a lifetime trip to Antarctica, is on its way back to her after she lost it three months ago on a snowy iceberg.

Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to the remote region costing around $13,000 after being invited along by friends who had a spare place on their trip.

She’d loaded her iPad up with episodes of American comedian Ellen DeGeneres’s chat show to entertain her while travelling to Antarctica and had been watching a Robin Williams episode with her fellow travellers in the moments before she lost her camera.

Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera.

‘We spent an open night on an iceberg, the only thing around us were penguins and seals lazing around. I took the camera out of my pocket and said “everyone let’s do a very Merry Christmas from Antarctica to Ellen because she’s entertaining us at the bottom of the earth”,’ Ms Boz explained.

'Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera!': This is the distinctive photo that helped tour operator staff identify Hulia Boz from the photos on her lost camera 

Moments after recording the festive message on December 12, on day seven of her trip to Earth's southernmost continent, Ms Boz got up to go to the ‘bathroom’.

‘You’ve got to build a wall from ice to go to the toilet. I went to do my wee and the camera must have fallen out of my pocket, I didn’t realise,’ she said.

The 34-year-old was unaware that she’d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings.

‘The ship started to pull away and I thought “where is the camera? Where is the camera?” and we thought “no we were going to send it to Ellen!”,’ Ms Boz laughed.

The story of how Ms Boz is now being reunited with her camera, which was white and camouflaged in the snow, is nothing short of a miracle.

Before departing on the ship to Antarctica, Ms Boz and the rest of her tour group had mugshots taken at the port in Ushuaia, Argentina – the southernmost city in the world - where they sailed from. All tourists heading to Antarctica have these photos taken so they can be officially identified if need be.

Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to Antarctica when she lost her camera. She took the white Canon camera along on her trip so she could capture 'silly' photos and used her professional cameras for landscape photography

She was lucky enough to get a spare place on the trip which cost her around $13,000 after being invited along by friends

Hulia and her fellow tourists were watching an Ellen DeGeneres episode before she lost her camera 

A traveller with a different tour company, Quark Expeditions, miraculously found Ms Boz’s camera in the snow on the same iceberg near Useful Island in February and took it back to the port in Ushuaia, where they handed it in.

Polar Operations Manager for Aurora travel Tomas Holik was given the camera ‘with no marking nor name on it’ and looked through the pictures stored on it, leading him to figure out that it belonged to Ms Boz as he compared the photos to the mugshots taken from recent expeditions.

'Once they saw all the young faces in the recording they found a voyage that happened to have young people on it.... they then sent my selfie to the ship's team leaders asking if they knew who I was,' Ms Boz explained.

‘By looking at its pictures I figured out that it belongs to a passenger of EAP27,’ Mr Holik wrote in an email to the Sydney-based tour company that Ms Boz travelled with.

Before Hulia knew that she would ever be reunited with her lost camera her friend sent her these photos that she had taken of her

Amongst the many memories from her two-week trip where plenty of fun selfies taken in the stunning snowy environment 

The group were camping out on an iceberg in  Useful Island in December when she lost her camera 

Assistant expedition leader Robyn Mundy replied: ‘I am amazed and astonished that someone found the camera. And returned it! We looked for it on the following voyage but there was still too much snow cover to find a white camera.’

‘It does indeed belong to one of our EAP27 passengers, Hulia Boz. Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera! If you could possibly get it back to Sydney via a staff member or passenger, I’m sure Hulia will be eternally grateful,’ Ms Mundy replied.

Ms Boz’s camera, which amazingly still works, is now on its way back to Sydney. 

‘When they told me the person’s flight details and the name I thought this is really real. I hadn’t put out a plea on social media because there is nothing there but ice and penguins,' she said.

Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera

Hulia still intends to send the Christmas message to Ellen once her camera returns to her, even if it is a bit late 

This photo shows the ship that the group travelled from Argentina to Antarctica in over four days 

Hulia has called the trip and the surprise of someone finding her camera in the remote snow 'the most over whelming experience of my life'

'The effort, patience and goodwill that was put into reuniting me with my memories by strangers has amazed me. It has restored my faith in humanity. 

'My camera was identified as my property by a selfie I had taken and the footage my friends and I had taken to send to Ellen DeGeneres as that was the last thing on the camera

'I am one lucky person who is grateful and overwhelmed by this all. Miracles do happen. Even if Antarctica is twice as big as Australia. Even with no permanent residence. Even if the colour of my camera was white and would be difficult to detect on ice,' she said happily.

'This truly was and probably will be the most over whelming experience of my life. I met some amazing talented people who I shared some very special memories with, built friendships for life, did some crazy things and most of all have one amazing story to tell my grand kids one day.'
