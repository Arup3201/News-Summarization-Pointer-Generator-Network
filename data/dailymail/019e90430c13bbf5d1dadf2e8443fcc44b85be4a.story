Cristiano Ronaldo found himself upstaged by Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema and former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba on Saturday night as France beat Portugal 2-1 in their international friendly.

Ronaldo, sitting on the bench with an ice pack on his left knee after being substituted on 76 minutes, could do little to turn Portugal's fortunes around at the Stade de France after the hosts took a third-minute lead through Benzema before Pogba doubled their advantage in the second half.

Portugal substitute Ricardo Quaresma set up a tense finale by slotting home a penalty for the visitors, but France held on to their slender advantage.

France wasted no time in dominating the visitors from the offset.

A low cross from the left by Antoine Griezmann found Bacary Sagna in space towards the back post, and the Manchester City defender forced  goalkeeper Rui Patricio to palm his shot away.

It did little good as the rebound fell to Benzema who, with the goal gaping, tapped the ball in to make it 1-0 with just three minutes on the clock.

Replays  on the big screen showed Ronaldo turning away, looking frustrated to relinquish a lead so early in the international friendly.

The former Manchester United star tried to trick his way beyond France's back line but his step-overs accomplished little during a less-than-convincing opening 45 minutes for the men in white.

Griezmann,  looking sharp  for France, weaved his way through Portugal's defence midway through the first half but a tame shot with the outside of his left foot was comfortably collected by Patricio.

Portugal, however, were nearly gifted an equaliser shortly before the break when France tried to pass their way out  from the back. 

It was Nani who almost punished the hosts' carelessness as the Manchester United winger, currently on loan at Sporting Lisbon, found himself with only goalkeeper Steve Mandanda to beat. 

His shot across goal, seemingly in slow motion, went agonisingly wide of the  right post and France's half-time lead remained intact.

After the break, Ronaldo looked hellbent on testing the France goalkeeper.

The 29-year-old, rising above surrounding defenders to meet Nani's cross, saw his header destined for the bottom-left corner, only for the right hand of Mandanda to deny the two-time Ballon d'Or winner.

Portugal sensed they were good for a goal but it was France who nabbed the all-important second. Patrice Evra, starting the move from a standard throw-in on the left, found himself charging at goal before squaring the ball to Benzema. 

The striker in turn set the ball for  Pogba who, with a drop of the shoulder, simply tucked it away into the bottom-left corner to make it 2-0. 

Again, Ronaldo was shown on the big screen for the 81,000 present before being substituted with 14 minutes remaining.

The man on in his place - Joao Mario - immediately had an impact by winning a penalty from a trip by Pogba. Another substitute, Quaresma, calmly slotted the resulting spot-kick beyond Mandanda to make it 2-1 with a little more than 10 minutes to play.

It proved too little, too late for Portugal, but those at the Bernabeu will be more concerned by the strapping on Ronaldo's left knee than the friendly defeat.
