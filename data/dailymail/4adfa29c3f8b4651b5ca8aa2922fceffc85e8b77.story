Wanted terrorist Mohamed Elomar could have appeared in an Islamic State propaganda video alongside a Sydney teenager.

On Tuesday, video surfaced of Abdullah Elmir, 17, who fled Australia back in June to join the terror group in Syria, telling his mother he was going fishing.

In the video posted on YouTube, Elmir - going by the name of Abu Khaled – makes threats to Australia and the rest of the Western world and also takes aim at Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

But a day later, speculation about the identity of a man who appeared alongside the teenager mounted and The Sydney Morning Herald reported intelligence officers were now looking closely at the video to determine if the man seen standing to the right of Elmir is the notorious extremist.

When asked by Daily Mail Australia if he thought the man in question was Elomar, Dr Jamal Rifi - a friend of the former boxer's family - said: 'I believe he is.'

Dr Rifi also added he had not spoken with the Elomars.

'They are overseas and I have no way in contacting them,' he said.

Fairfax Media has been told intelligence agencies were inspecting the video and chief among their concerns was the man standing closest to Elmir is the wanted terrorist who has close ties with another extremist, Khaled Sharrouf.

Earlier this year, Sharrouf caused a worldwide stir when he posted photos on Twitter of his son proudly holding up a severed head in Syria.

Warrants for the arrest of Elomar and Sharrouf were issued by the Australian Federal Police in July.

In the recently emerged footage, Elmir is flanked by his Islamic State comrades with the well-known black and white flag and brandishing a weapon.

Elomar is one of two notorious extremists the Australian Federal Police have put arrest warrants out for in July 

The jihadist claimed IS were going to put a 'black flag on top of Buckingham Palace' and the White House.

'We will keep on fighting and we will fight you and defeat you,' he stated.

As his hate-filled diatribe finishes he begins chanting in Arabic and the fighters around him join in.

Throughout, the man believed to Elomar alternates his gaze from Elmir and in front of him.

His face remains expressionless and the only time he shows any emotion is when he joins in chanting with his brothers-in-arms at the conclusion of the video.

The man holds a rifle in front of his body with both hands.
