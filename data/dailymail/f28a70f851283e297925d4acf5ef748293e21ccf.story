Mugshot: Alicia Gray was charged with two counts of second-degree sodomy and one count of second-degree sexual abuse

A married Alabama math teacher has been indicted on sex charges after she allegedly gave a 14-year-old student oral sex in February.

A Mobile County grand jury has indicted Mary G. Montgomery High School math teacher Alicia Gray on charges of first-degree sodomy, sexual abuse and being a school employee who engaged in a sex act with a student younger than 19.

Gray faces 10 years to life for the most serious charge, sodomy, which is a Class A felony. The other felony charge is punishable by up to 20 years.

A judge had just found probable cause last week to send the case to a grand jury, AL.com reported.

It can take months for a grand jury to act on a case but Mobile County Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson said they had a sitting grand jury, which helped speed the process along.

Gray, 28, remains free on bail and on paid leave from the Mobile County school system.

According to NBC-15, the student told investigators his relationship with Gray started around New Year's Day and became more serious, ultimately leading to 'an exchange of oral sex' near or at the victim's home.

The boy also told police Gray 'took several nude pictures' of herself and sent them to him via cell phone.

A Mobile County District Court Judge on February 20 granted warrant to search Gray's home and officers seized several flash drives, two digital cameras and a cell phone.

Patterson said there was 'additional evidence' to support the student's statement.

The case now will be assigned 
randomly to a Mobile County Circuit Court judge, who will set an 
arraignment date. That likely will be in a few weeks.

The teacher was arrested in February after she turned herself in for the alleged affair with a minor.

Gray was accompanied by her husband 
and attorney when she surrendered herself to authorities at Mobile 
County Metro Jail, after a warrant had been issued for her arrest and an
investigation into the relationship was launched.

Gray
was booked into jail on two counts of second-degree sodomy, one count 
of second-degree sexual abuse and one count of school employee having 
sexual relations with a student under the age of 19.

The
teacher was released two hours later after posting bail. Police 
initially released few details about the arrest and said in February 
their investigation was 'ongoing.'

Popular teacher: Former students off Gray said they were shocked by the allegations

On the MGM High School's website, Gray described herself as 'highly qualified in mathematics.'

Former students said they were shocked by the allegations.

Her biography has since been removed after school officials placed her on administrative leave.

'She's really cool,' said former student Matt Boykin.

'I had her class when I was in ninth grade. I struggled with math a lot, and she really helped me.'

Gray had graduated from Mary G 
Montgomery High school and went on to pursue a bachelor degree in 
mathematics education from the University of Mobile in May 2007.

She then received her masterâ€™s degree in teaching and learning from Nova Southeastern University in May 2011.
