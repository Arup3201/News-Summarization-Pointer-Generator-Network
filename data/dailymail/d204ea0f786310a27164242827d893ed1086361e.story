Human remains found in a car pulled from the bottom of a Florida canal over the weekend are believed to be those of a man missing for nearly a decade.

The body found Saturday inside a green Ford Thunderbird is assumed by many to be that of William Naylor, a 69-year-old Coconut Grove man missing since February 2005. The car was pulled from a canal directly behind his home.

The medical examiner has yet to identify the remains, but both family and a woman searching for Naylor since his disappearance insists it is him.

Missing for nine years: William Naylor hasn't been seen since 2005

Salvaged: Naylor's green Ford Thunderbird was pulled Saturday from a local creek

‘In my heart I really do think it's him,’ Dinorah Perry, head of Missing Children International Ministries, told WPLG.

MCIM is a non-profit group that had been helping Naylor’s family search for the long-missing man.

Derek Borrero, owner of Aquatic Ops, detailed the salvage operation to WSVN.

‘We got in the water at approximately 10:05 [a.m.],’ he said. At approximately 10:26, we located a vehicle. It took about 40 yards swimming. I had three divers in the water.’

They found something just eight inches below the surface using search sticks and soon pulled out the muck covered car.

‘Well, it happened to be a Ford Thunderbird,’ Borrero said, before adding that he was sure it was the missing man’s car.

Investigation: Authorities immediately began pouring over the car for evidence, foul play is not suspected

‘The color was identical to what he was driving at the time, even though the car has been in the water for nine years,’ he continued. ‘The tag number matched the flyer number, so once we got those tag numbers, we could verify that it was his vehicle.’

The canal is right behind where the retired county employee lived right up until his disappearance, according to the Sun Sentinel.

'It's just ironic that they would find him right here all along,' daughter Jeanie Naylor told the paper.

She said she is convinced the car is her father’s, but the medical examiner said dental records will be needed to confirm the identity of the body found inside.

William Naylor took medication for his Parkinson’s Disease that had hallucinatory effects.

The man stormed angrily out of his home the night he disappeared after it was suggested he live in an assisted living facility because of his medical condition, she continued.

He was never seen again.

Authorities do not believe foul play is involved.

Family searched five years for their missing patriarch, and even called police stations up and down the east coast hoping to get lucky.

A failure to turn up any leads led his daughter to believe the worst.

'When [police] couldn't find his car — I mean, you usually find an abandoned car,' she told the paper. 'I knew he was in a canal.'

Hauled away: The car were taken away for further investigation, the human remains were sent to the medical examiner's office for identification

It turns out she was right, and MCIM helped bring her to the bittersweet moment.

The group found the car as part of their ‘Cars held Hostage’ program, which searches waterways for missing people and vehicles, Perry told NBC Miami.

‘Families, they're not asking for much, they're just asking for a tiny tiny piece of closure,’ she told the station.

She said they were overwhelmed at the thought he was finally found after all these years.

‘I know the family had a rough time last night,’ said Perry. ‘You know, emotions, they cried, they're happy, they're sad.’
