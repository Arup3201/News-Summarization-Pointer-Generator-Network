We've all had those days. You barely get to midday before your stomach is gurgling angrily. But instead of giving in to your craving for carbs, you opt for a tuna nicoise salad from Pret A Manger, containing — according to the label on the shelf — only 168 calories. So far, so virtuous.

Until you inspect the label in more detail to find the calorie count doesn’t actually include the calories in the dressing. To find that out, you have to go to the company’s website, where you’ll discover that the salad including dressing comes in at 399 calories. In other words, the dressing contains more calories than the actual salad — with 24 g of fat for good measure.

Your ‘virtuous’ salad has more calories than a McDonald’s cheeseburger, which has 295. 

Inspect the label of some salads in more detail and you'll find the calorie count doesn’t actually include the calories in the dressing

Pret, which has more than 240 UK stores, appears to apply this practice quite liberally across its salad range. Its undressed ‘Superfood’ salad comes in at 431 calories and 17.9 g of fat, but 662 calories and 41.7 g of fat when the dressing is added.

Chef’s Chicken Salad? No better. Without dressing it’s 316 calories — with dressing it’s 547, and the fat rockets from 20.7 g to 44.5 g.

So is Pret a one-off? No. The same principle applies at Eat, which has 112 branches in the UK and a similar labelling system.

Both Pret and Eat are signatories to the Department Of Health’s Responsibility Deal, which agreed in 2011 to a ‘core commitment to encourage and enable people to adopt a healthier diet’

Its houmous and falafel mezze salad has 395 calories undressed, but pour over the little pot of dressing and it’s almost 500 calories. Again, you have to go to its website to find this out.

Its Thai rare beef noodle salad is labelled on the shelves as containing 169 calories, 4.4g of fat and 8.1g of sugar ‘undressed’. A quick check on the website finds that the dressing adds 92 calories, 3.1 g of fat and 14.3g of sugar — that’s around three-and-a-half teaspoons.

Consultant dietitian Helen Bond says: ‘Those dressings can add a significant number of calories, which is potentially not good news for your waistline, cholesterol levels, dental health and blood pressure.

The phrase 'salad days' was coined by Shakespeare in 1606 in his play Antony And Cleopatra 

‘An extra 231 calories from a dressing each day over five days provides an additional 1,155 calories. One pound of fat contains 3,500 calories, so if you eat the same Pret tuna nicoise salad every day with dressing, over a month you would add 4,620 calories — more than a pound of weight gain.’ Both Pret and Eat are signatories to the Department Of Health’s Responsibility Deal, which agreed in 2011 to a ‘core commitment to encourage and enable people to adopt a healthier diet’ — including promises on clear calorie labelling.

Condemning the practice of listing extra calories on websites as opposed to shelves, Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum says: ‘That’s a cop-out. How many people access a website when they’re going in for a coffee and a salad?

‘The Responsibility Deal, which the Government wants all retail outlets and manufacturers to follow, should ensure that the total number of calories within a package is identified on the label, for the very point that sometimes the sauces and the other bits and pieces are loaded with fat, sugar and sometimes salt.’

Pret insists it has nothing to apologise for. ‘Pret’s shelf labels make it clear that the nutritional values are for the salad ingredients without its dressing,’ a spokesman says.

‘The dressing is optional and is separately packed inside the salad box because we recognise that customers may wish to add a lot, a little or none at all.

‘Ideally, we would list nutritional values for both the salad and its dressing, but the quantity of information makes this difficult to do. The nutritional values of all Pret’s food, including dressings, are available on the website should customers wish to find out.’

Eat also claims it is ‘absolutely committed to the pledges’ of the Responsibility Deal. ‘We’ve talked to customers to ensure that the information we provide them with is what they would like to see,’ said a spokesman.

‘On a small label, we are only able to present a limited amount of information. Anyone interested in understanding the nutritional content with the dressing can find this on our website or speak to any of our team in the shop, who have this information readily to hand.’

However, the sushi chain Itsu (which has almost 50 stores in London), juice bar Crussh (25 stores in London) and Pod (23 in London) have all found space on their normal-size labels to include calorie counts for both the salads and their dressings — as have bigger chains, including Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and Boots.

Crussh managing director Chris Fung says: ‘If you really want to do it, you can do it, which is what we’ve done. We think it’s important for us.

‘There are practical constraints, but is that an excuse? I guess it depends on how important it is to you as a business.’

For those minding their waistlines, the message is clear: steer clear of dressings, or pick a sandwich shop that tells you the calorie count of everything you’re eating — not just the healthy bit.
