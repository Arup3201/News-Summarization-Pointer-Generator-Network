Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords has pleaded for patience in gun control on the third anniversary of a gun attack that left her fighting for her life and six people dead.

The former Arizona congresswoman was among 13 people wounded in a January 2011 shooting outside a Tucson, Ariz., supermarket at the hands of gunman Jared Loughner. The Democrat resigned from Congress a year later.

The 43-year-old, now the face of the national gun control effort, has endured three years of gruelling recovery after she was shot in the head, learning how to talk and walk again.

In an op-ed printed in the New York Times on the third anniversary of the assault, she likened her gun control fight to her time in recovery writing: 'Our fight is a lot more like my rehab. Every day, we must wake up resolved and determined.

'We’ll pay attention to the details; look for opportunities for progress, even when the pace is slow. Some progress may seem small, and we might wonder if the impact is enough, when the need is so urgent. '

But every day we will recruit a few more allies, talk to a few more elected officials, convince a few more voters. Some days the steps will come easily; we’ll feel the wind at our backs. Other times our knees will buckle. We’ll tire of the burden. I know this feeling. But we’ll persist.

'We can get tough and win elections. We’ll support our allies. And those who stood in the way will face a powerful advocacy community standing between them and re-election.

Ms Giffords is pro-gun ownership but anti-gun violence.

In October Ms Giffords toured rows of 
tables loaded with rifles and handguns today in her first visit to a gun
 show since surviving the 2011 shooting.

She
 visited the Saratoga Springs Arms Fair with her astronaut husband, Mark
 Kelly and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to highlight a 
voluntary agreement that closely monitors gun show sales in New York.

We must never stop fighting,' she said at a post-tour news conference, her fist in the air. 'Fight! Fight! Fight! Be bold! Be courageous!'

Ms Giffords,slowly walked hand-in-hand with Mr Kelly through the large room where Winchester rifles, muzzle-loaders, antique knives and other weapons were on display and 'Don't Tread on Me' flags hung from poles.

They stopped at display tables, Mr Kelly asked dealers questions about the weapons, and Ms Giffords shook hands and smiled when people greeted her.

'Good to see you looking good!' some said.

Gunman Jared Loughner shot Giffords in 2011

Kelly bought a book on Colt revolvers, and said later he probably would have bought a gun if he had had more time. He said both he and his wife are gun owners.

The
 trio mixed with a gun show crowd that was mostly welcoming - with a few
 hostile undertones before calling for people to build on the 
cooperative effort.

In June it was revealed Mr Kelly likes to do target practice with exactly the same kind of gun which was used to shoot her - as she cheers him on from their porch.

The couple admit they still love the ‘gun culture’ and argue that their knowledge of guns gives them more credibility with the gun lobby and the National Rifle Association.

They have made themselves strident gun campaigners and Giffords’ face is now on a huge billboard in New York’s Times Square asking for tougher checks on those buying firearms.

Mr Kelly bought the assault rifle in March at a gun shop in Tucson to show how easy it was to buy such a weapon.

But after his motives became public the shop owner refused to hand it over and gave him a refund, claiming that it was not for ‘personal use’ so he could not sell it.

At the time, Todd Rathner, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association's affiliate in Arizona and a national NRA board member, questioned the point that Mr Kelly was trying to make.

He said: ‘If you believe him, it's a cheap publicity stunt. If you don't, then he was speculating on the value of the rifle because he knew the prices would be inflated.’
