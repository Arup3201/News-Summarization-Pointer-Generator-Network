A 26-year-old woman has been charged with the rape and sodomy of a 13-year-old boy.

Lauren Flowers Baker of Decatur, Alabama, was indicted on charges of statutory rape and second-degree sodomy.

Baker turned herself in last Friday and is free after posting $20,000 bond at Morgan County Jail. 

Lauren Flowers Baker of Decatur, Alabama, was indicted on charges of statutory rape and second-degree sodomy.

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Baker's defense attorney Kevin Teague but he told the Decatur Daily that his client is maintaining her innocence.

Decatur police say the alleged assaults were reported to them on Valentine's Day 2013 and an investigation took place.

A grand jury examined the findings on February 6 and indicted Baker almost one year later in Morgan County.

Decatur's Violent Crimes Unit, Morgan County Department of Human Resources, Child Advocacy Center and the District Attorney's Office conducted a joint investigation.

Rape in the second-degree is charged when someone over the age of 16 'engages in sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex less than 16 and more than 12 years old - provided, however, the actor is at least two years older than the member of the opposite sex', according to the Decatur police report. 

Both charges are Class B felonies.

MailOnline was awaiting a call from the Morgan County District Attorney's Office.

Lauren Flowers Baker handed herself in to Morgan County Jail last week and was released on $20,000 bond
