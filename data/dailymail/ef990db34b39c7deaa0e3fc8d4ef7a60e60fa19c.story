More than 80 survivors of the Asiana Airlines plane crash filed a lawsuit against aircraft manufacturer Boeing on Friday.

In the complaint the survivors allege that because parts of the plane's equipment were faulty or wrongly installed, the pilots had little warning of their low airspeed.

Three people were killed when the aeroplane, carrying 307 people on a flight from South Korea to San Francisco, clipped a seawall and crashed on July 6.

Monica Kelly, an attorney for Chicago-based Ribbeck Law Chartered, told CNN on Saturday: 'We are asking for damages to be paid to the passengers and asking the court to hold Boeing partially liable.'

The lawsuit says that Boeing knew, or should have known, its 777 passenger jet did not have adequate auto-throttle control or low airspeed warning systems, according to the Chicago Tribune newspaper.

Around 180 were injured in the crash, and more than 80 are now claiming compensation for 'pain and suffering, disability, mental anguish, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, medical treatment, loss of income, and medical expenses'.

The survivors launched a legal campaign in the immediate aftermath of the crash, filing a petition for discovery - a move meant to preserve evidence.

At the time, law firm Ribbeck said it was considering adding Asiana and certain parts manufacturers to the lawsuit, but Friday's filing named only Boeing. The lawsuit was filed at Cook County Superior Court, Illinois.

Boeing could not be contacted for comment and the cause of the crash is still being investigated.

Last week harrowing and never-before-seen footage from the frantic aftermath revealed that firefighters tragically did not realize that a 16-year-old victim was still alive - and ran her over twice 15 minutes later.

Video from a camera mounted on a San Francisco firetruck shows at least two emergency workers alerting vehicles to go around Chinese student Ye Meng Yuan as she lay on the ground by the stricken aircraft.

The first responders believed she was dead and did not check her vital signs.

Miss Yuan was one of three Chinese teenagers who died; the second died during the crash and another later in the hospital.

Her parents have filed a claim against the city of San Francisco, saying rescuers were reckless and poorly trained.

In their claim, attorneys representing Yuan's parents name 37 specific airport, fire and police department employees, saying they and others 'breached their duty of care'. They do not specify damages.

The San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) does not comment on pending lawsuits.
