Former POW Bowe Bergdahl is being allowed to wander off the Texas base where he is being held as part of his 'reintegration', it has emerged.

While under supervision, the solider, who was released by the Taliban in May in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees, has visited a library, a supermarket, stores and fast-food chains near to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.

During the 
trips, Bergdahl sometimes wears civilian clothing and other times 
dresses in his military uniform, leading passersby to recognize him and 
shake his hand, an Army spokesperson told CNN.

The details have emerged as soldiers who served with Bergdahl before he left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 revealed they have still not been contacted by military investigators.

Questions: A new investigation has been launched to determine whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, deserted his post or went AWOL when he was reported missing in Afghanistan in 2009

The former 
soldiers have said that they believe the Army has failed to contact them
 because it has already made up its mind about how Bergdahl ended up in 
the hands of the Taliban.

Members
 of Bergdahl's unit - including the platoon leader - have previously 
said they believe he deserted his post in June 2009 before seeking out 
the enemy.

But when he was swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees on May 31, President Obama gave him a hero's welcome and said the switch had been prompted by Bergdahl's poor health.

Two-star general Major General Kenneth Dahl is now conducting a new investigation to determine whether Bergdahl did desert his post or went AWOL, which would suggest he intended to rejoin.

But for former platoon leader Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, who left the Army in 2012, the answer is the same as it always was.

'I think it's very clear he 
deserted his post,' Buetow told FoxNews.com. 'He thought about what he 
was doing, he mailed some things home, he walked away and we have 
witnesses who saw him walking away.

Left out: Former platoon leader and Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, pictured in a previous Fox interview, said he believes the investigators have already made up their mind about what happened

'And if you’re walking away in one of
 the worst, most dangerous areas of Afghanistan without your weapon and 
gear, I don’t believe you’re planning on coming back.'

Of the investigation, he added: 'They've already concluded what they want to be said. They know exactly what happened.'

Former Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant also said he had not been contacted by Army officials, but said there are probably still sworn statements by the unit's members made after he left the post.

'I have confidence that they're going to do what’s right,' Vierkant said. 'I just feel this should've happened a long time ago and it should've been public.'

Vierkant also believes that Bergdahl deserted his unit, which means he should be court martialed.

Bergdahl is
 now receiving outpatient care at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio and 
has ventured off base to the library, a supermarket, stores and 
restaurants as part of his reintegration process.

After his reintegration process, he will be assigned to an Army unit, according to the official.

But if Army officials determine that he did desert, Buetow said the one-time 'good soldier' should be court-martialed, demoted and dishonorably discharged

Army officials told Fox that the investigating officer will usually review any materials that are provided but said they could not contact of the specific soldiers.
