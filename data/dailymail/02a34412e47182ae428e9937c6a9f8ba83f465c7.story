A Chinese care worker cut off four patients' testicles because they didn't share their meatball stew with him, it has been claimed.

Wang Fan, 46, who was described as mentally disabled, was given a job helping to feed and clean at the care home in north-eastern China's Heilongjiang Province. 

Although he was not paid, he was given a place to sleep and was allowed to eat the food left over after the patients had been fed.

However, he was apparently furious after the patients were given a meatball casserole and ate the lot, meaning there was none left over for the hungry care worker.

Furious at the treatment, he had extracted revenge on four of the patients in his care before he was finally discovered and stopped by other staff.

Police said that he tied down the men and used a razor blade to cut off their testicles in the attack at the end of last week.

Victim Chi Liang, 62, said: 'I thought he was tying me down because of some medical procedure but then I realised actually something was wrong and I yelled and screamed, but nobody came.'

Liang and another man, aged 70, lost both their testicles and two others, aged 81 and 53, lost one testicle each. 

Police said that the attacker had been drinking and added that he had reportedly planned to cook and eat the testicles, which as well as being food he also thought had medicinal properties.

The case has illustrated poor management at some of China's nursing homes, which are troubled by insufficient funding and personnel despite rising demand from an ageing population.

The publicly owned care home where the tragedy happened is home to 165 people, all either impoverished rural elders or mentally handicapped.

Local reporters visiting the site found the rooms crowded and smelly.

Many patients had not bathed for months, and the standard of care was so poor that the fourth victim aged 70 was only discovered a day later after being left in his bloodstained bed after the incident.

All four of the injured men are out of danger but remain hospitalised.
