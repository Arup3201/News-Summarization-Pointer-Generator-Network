The whirring of the milk float and chinking of the bottles used to be a sound as much a part of a morning as the dawn chorus of songbirds.

But one dairy that was a victim to the rise of the supermarkets has ensured that a vivid picture of the old tradition remains by keeping detailed records and nostalgic photographs of their business.

The archives of Thompson's Dairies of Beverley preserve the cherished memories that have faded from our minds, showing pictures of old milk floats and a daily log of deliveries made to schools in the region.

Doing the rounds: A milk-man gets ready to deliver the bottles to the doorstep. The tradition might be a thing of the past but the archives of the Thompson Dairy in Beverley, East Yorkshire, are preserving the memories

The records document the activities of the dairy, based in East Yorkshire, from the 1940s to the early 1990s, painting a picture of a time where levels of trust were so much higher that doors weren't locked and money was left on the top of the fridge.

They are held by the council of East Riding which has made them available to the public.

Sales records reveal exactly what was sold by the business on a weekly basis, including non-dairy products like fruit juice and bread.

Mark Thompson, one of four brothers 
involved in the business, remembers parents Raymond and June going out 
twice a day on a horse and cart to deliver milk in Beverley when he was 
just three.

'They'd be up at 3am leaving us in bed and they'd be back at 7am,' he said.

'You
 had to do it twice a day in those days as milk wasn't pasteurised then.
 By the time it got to tea-time it was on its way out.'

After the horse and cart - the horse Kate was grazed on Hall Garth opposite Beverley Minster - came electrical milk floats in their familiar green and cream livery.

A proud tradition: The four Thompson brothers are pictured with their father Raymond (centre) in 1982. He is remembered by them as 'a stickler for work'

East Riding towns Beverley, 
Cottingham, Walkington and Newbald were all part of the Thompson 
territory, whch expanded to include Pocklington and villages like 
Everingham, when they bought Jacksons Dairy.

Youngest brother Quentin Thomas remembers times when levels of trust were far higher.

'In
 Everingham people would be out to work on the fields. Doors weren't 
locked and you would go into the kitchen and the money would be on top 
of the fridge,' he said.

'There
 would be money for the butcher, the fishmonger and the milkman, all in 
separate heaps. You would look in the fridge and see how much milk there
 was.'

The life of a dairy:  Records from the Thomspon's Dairy (pictured left) and photographs dating as far back as the 1940s tell the story of the East Yorkshire family business through the decades. The owner, Raymond Thompson, is pictured standing proudly on one of his milk floats in the 1960s

Thompsons Dairies was first 
established in 1882 as a small-scale operation in the yard of 97 
Keldgate, Beverley. It later grew to become the chief supplier of milk 
and other dairy products in the Beverley area and was a strong 
competitor to Dale Farm - which it eventually sold out to a century 
later.

Every member of the
 family had their role - Raymond, a stickler for work - oversaw the milk
 testing, public health and customer care, Andrew was on production and 
packaging, Mark would organise staff, Geoffrey, office and accounts and 
Quentin vehicle maintenance.

They had 16 rounds at Beverley, eight at Pocklington and five of school milk until Margaret Thatcher stopped it in the 1970s.

Hull wasn't their traditional ground - people still like their 'steri', sterilised milk, whereas Beverley was a firmly fat silver-top town.

The fad for dieting led to a whole new range of skimmed milk being produced at the dairy - a reverse of the situation just a few years previously where there was no demand for milk with the cream skimmed off and it had to be fed to the pigs.

When Raymond retired, new rules which required a £2m upgrade of their dairy in Figham and falling profit margins due to customers switching to supermarket milk, were all factors in the decision to sell up.

Quentin added: 'The customer base was disappearing rapidly, it was a change in lifestyles. People were mortgaged up and interest rates were going up and instead of the wife being at home she was going out to work.

'She didn't want the bottle on the doorstep going sour, they wanted a supermarket for convenience and it was getting cheaper.

'We were doing four pint jugs at £1.10 - it doesn't cost that much to buy 20 years on. The dairy farmers have had a raw deal I would say.'

The business ceased trading in 1992, but its memory will live on in the archives.

Sam Bartle, collections officer at East Riding Archives and Local Studies Service, said: 'As generations come and go, these archives will act as a reminder of the days of the milkman, and teach us about what was once a way of life for millions.'
