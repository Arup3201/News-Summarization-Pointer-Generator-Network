Blackpool have announced that their former goalkeeper Iain Hesford has passed away at the age of 54.

Hesford made his debut for the Seasiders in 1977 before going on to play for Sunderland and Hull in a career which spanned three decades.

Most of his time was spent at Blackpool and he made more than 200 league appearances in six years at Bloomfield Road.
