A man accused of riding city buses looking for victims of sexual assault has been charged with raping an 18-year-old disabled woman in the back of a Los Angeles County transit bus last week.

Prosecutors say 20-year-old Kerry Trotter pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to one count each of forcible rape and rape of an incompetent person, and two counts of sexual penetration by a foreign object.

Authorities say Trotter and the woman boarded the bus at the same stop last Wednesday and he allegedly raped her in the back over a 10 minute period.

Savage attack: Kerry Trotter, 20, has been charged with raping a mentally disabled woman on the back of a public transit bus last week

The woman, said to have the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, was described by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department as too scared to cry out.

'The victim told our detective that she was shocked, and didn't know what to do, and was in fear of her safety and her life,' sheriff's Sgt. Dan Scott told the Los Angeles Times.

Video surveillance only captured the back of the attacker's ahead covering her during the attack, according to police.

'I looked at the tape twice,' Metropolitan Transportation Authority official Mark Littman told CBS LA. 'It appears (no one knew until the victim herself told the bus driver.)'

Vehicle of attack: Police say Trotter entered the bus, one pictured, at the same time of his victim before following her to the back and raping her over a 10-minute period

Unnoticed: Passengers and the bus driver failed to notice the attack with the victim, who has the mentality of a 10-year-old, later telling police she was too frightened to scream

Trotter was arrested hours after thanks to an anonymous tip by someone who saw an image taken from a surveillance camera.

He was ordered to remain jailed in lieu of $285,000 bail. It's not immediately known if Trotter has retained an attorney.

If convicted, Trotter faces more than 20 years in prison.

Hiding plea: Trotter pleaded not guilty to one count each of forcible rape and rape of an incompetent person, and two counts of sexual penetration by a foreign object while standing outside this courtroom door

Trotter has a lengthy criminal record according to the district attorney's office, including previous allegations of sexual assault.

He was on probation for grand theft at the time of his arrest.

Speaking on his intent that day, the sheriff's department told the Los Angeles Times they believe he rode city buses looking for victims.
