This is the terrifying moment a racist thug waved a samurai sword in the street threatening to 'kill all the Poles' before slashing a man in the back. 

In photographs handed to police by a bystander, Gareth Devlin is seen with the weapon in his hand while walking in the street in Teesside. 

The 28-year-old was jailed for five years after a court heard how he frightened children by waving the weapon around one summer afternoon.

Polish nationals had been drinking on the afternoon in question, when many of the residents on the quiet street were enjoying the Brazil v Netherlands third-place playoff in the FIFA World Cup.

Devlin and his friend, 24-year-old Joseph Smithson, approached the men, shouting: 'Come on!' Teesside Crown Court heard. 

Threatening: 'I will kill you,' he struck the sword down on one man's back as he tried frantically to flee the scene. 

'One of the witnesses, to their great credit, grabbed a camera,' prosecutor Paul Cleasby said.

'He was a keen photographer and he was able to take photographs of the assailants.

'That at the time proved to be the best evidence.

'Your Honour sees Gareth Devlin with a sword in his hand in broad daylight walking down the street.

The 28-year-old threatened the group of Poles shouting: 'I will kill you' before striking one of them

'He has attempted to disguise himself with a hood over his face.'

'Were it not for his quick thinking and good work, the Crown would not have the case that they have,' Gazette Live.

Sentencing the father-to-be to five years in jail, Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said: 'You, Mr Devlin, took part in a very bad attack upon this Polish gentleman for reasons only you can understand.

'You know, and you’ve set out in your letter, that only a sentence of custody can be considered, and a lengthy sentence at that.' 

He told Smithson the time he had spent on remand - equal to an eight-month sentence - was enough custody for his crime. 

Outside court, Detective Constable Alan O’Donoghue, of Cleveland Police, said: 'We very much welcome the sentence given today.

'It sends a clear message that people cannot behave in this way, threatening people in broad daylight in the street.

'We will always do all we can to bring offenders before the courts.'
