This is the pregnant teenager who killed a police officer in a suicide bomb attack in Turkey.

Islamic State jihadist Diana Ramazanova, 18, blew herself up while detonating grenades in front of the Istanbul tourism police station last week.

Ramazanova, from Russia's Muslim region of Dagestan, is understood to have been the widow of an ISIS fighter killed six weeks ago in Syria.

She married Abu Aluevitsj Edelbijev, a Norwegian citizen of Chechen origin, in a religious ceremony last year, either in Istanbul or in Syria, according to Turkish media.

Family and friends said she had totally changed after meeting her extremist husband on a social networking site and then in Turkey.

Her stepfather Magomed Ramazanov said: 'Before leaving for Turkey, she was not deeply religious. 

'On the contrary, she was even depraved. In Moscow, Diana worked in the restaurant at the Kursk station. I always scolded her for wearing short skirts.'

Tabloid news site lifenews.ru also quoted a Moscow teacher as saying: 'I even rebuked her for wearing unsuitable clothes at school.' 

Russian and Turkish media have published pictures of Ramazanova before she was married, showing a seemingly normal girl who took good care of her appearance.

But they were also quick to dub her a 'black widow', the label given to female suicide bombers from the Caucasus who carried out attacks after their husbands were killed by Russian security forces.

Her mother Raizanat reportedly recognised the pictures of her daughter from Istanbul and has given a blood sample to enable DNA testing to confirm her identity. 

The Hurriyet daily newspaper claimed Ramazanova had entered Turkey on a tourist visa in May 2014, but Edelbijev may have entered the country illegally. 

Last July, the pair crossed the border from Turkey into Syria, joining ISIS jihadists who have seized large parts of Syria up to the Turkish border.

He took the name of Idris while she became known as Sumeyra, it said. 

After his death in December, she crossed the border back into Turkey on 26 December and stayed for 11 days at the Kadikoy Bade Hotel.

She had two hand grenades when she attacked the police station at Sultanahmet.

The first grenade did not explode and when she took out the second police shot her.

The second grenade killed her and an officer. Another officer was injured.

Ramazanova, from Russia's Muslim region of Dagestan, was not seen as deeply religious, wore bright make up, dressed fashionably and attracted attention

Born in the mainly Muslim region of Dagestan in southern Russia, she had moved with her mother and stepfather, a builder, to Moscow. 

Magomed's relationship with his stepdaughter was described by Russian reports as strained.  

She was sent back to Dagestan where she graduated from a school in Derbent.

After this, she returned to Moscow and worked as a shop assistant and in a restaurant.

She was not seen as deeply religious and, say reports, wore bright make up, dressed fashionably, and attracted attention.

Magomed said: 'Since June 2014 she has lived in Turkey.

'In the summer my wife and son and daughter went to the sea in Derbent. And when I came to them, my wife said that Diana had gone to Turkey for a holiday.

'I was still surprised that a young girl had gone there alone. It turned out she did not ask any permission. 

I did not know about her marriage. They hid this from me.'

Russia media cited acquaintances of Ramazanova in Dagestan and Moscow as saying she had totally changed after meeting her extremist husband on a social networking site

Some reports say that her husband was from Chechnya and had lived as an emigre in Norway before moving to Istanbul. 

According to a source in the Turkish intelligence, Diana Ramazanova met with her husband - also named as Abu Edelbievym - through social networks, and in May 2014 came to Istanbul, where she saw him face to face him for the first time.  

The wedding ceremony took place in the mosque. 

According to the Turkish media, Edelbijev was a weightlifting champion in Norway at the age of 17.

His father was also a well-known weightlifter in the USSR, it was reported.

More recently, he became radicalised and showed sympathies for ISIS.

He evidently entered Turkey illegally - there are no entry stamps - before spending three months with Diana in Istanbul from May.

They made 'multiple' trips to Syria via Kilis and Gaziantep, it was reported.  

After her husband's death on December 26, Diana illegally crossed the Turkish-Syrian border, arriving first in Gaziantep and took a taxi to Istanbul - a distance of some is 1,140 km.

How she obtained the money for the taxi is not known. 

Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that the local security services in Dagestan also believed Ramazanova had carried out the suicide bombing.

Deadly: Forensic officers work at the scene of the suicide bombing in central Istanbul which killed one police officer and injured another

Attacked: The female suicide bomber went into the police station in the Sultanahmet district and told the police in English she had lost her wallet before setting off her charge

Hurriyet said security services are still trying to ascertain whether she brought her explosives with her from Syria or whether they had been given to her by a contact in Istanbul. 

If confirmed, the newspaper's information would make clear for the first time a jihadist link to the Istanbul suicide bombing.

It also raises new questions about the laxity of Turkey's border security, which has already been criticised by Western states for allowing jihadists in and out of Syria. 

Lifenews also cited sources as saying she was the wife of Edelbijev who had died in Syria.

Ramazanova's purported page on Russian social network VKontakte, with a profile picture of her eating a cake, gives her date of birth as January 10, 1996 and main interests as cinema and music.

Specialist Russian website Kavkaski Uzel (Caucasian Knot) said that Istanbul had become a popular refuge for radically-minded Muslims from the Caucasus who were now fearing a crackdown on their presence.
