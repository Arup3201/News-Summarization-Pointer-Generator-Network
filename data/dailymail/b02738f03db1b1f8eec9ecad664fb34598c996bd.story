An unhinged man described by his family as 'angry towards everything' went on a shooting spree in Seattle yesterday killing five people and critically injuring one before turning the gun on himself.

Ian Stawicki, 40, entered the Cafe Racer Espresso in the University District of the city around 11am and opened fire, shooting five people.

Four of those shot at the cafe died while the fifth fatality was a married mother-of-two gunned down near Town Hall some five miles away.

Stawicki's victims in the café included God's Favourite Beefcake band members Joe 'Vito' Albanese, 52, and his bandmate and best friend Drew Keriakedes, 45.

The other two victims were a man and a woman, taken to Harborview Medical Center where they later died. They have not yet been named.

Half an hour after these shootings, 
Stawicki fatally shot Gloria Leonidas, a married mother-of-two in a 
parking lot near to Town Hall before fleeing in her black Mercedes SUV.

Leaving
 the SUV at the side of the road in West Seattle, Stawicki was 
apprehended by a plain clothed police officer who called for back-up at 
around 4pm.

When 
the police moved in to arrest Stawicki he knelt on the floor and shot 
himself in the head and was then taken to Harborview where he later 
died.

Stawicki's brother Andrew, 29, of Ellensburg, told the Seattle Times that when he saw
 a surveillance photo on the news of the alleged gunman inside Cafe Racer he 
recognised it as his brother.

He said his brother had been suffering from mental illness, adding: 'It's no surprise this happened. We could see this coming. 
Nothing good is going to come with that much anger inside of you.'

'When I was little, he would take me to punk rock concerts and big 
brother things. He was great.' But over the past five or so years, he said he changed.

He added: 'Angry. He was really angry toward everything. And his father Walt told ABC News that his son, a regular at the coffee shop where his rampage began, was a 'very private person'.

He said: 'He was happy sometimes, but not really. He was kind of disgruntled.'

He also revealed that his son had a girlfriend but was not married, had no children, and had recently worked on a fishing processing boat in Alaska.

The two separate shooting incidents in Seattle on Wednesday 
set off an extensive city-wide manhunt and forced officials to 
close nearby schools.

One other victim, Leonard Meuse, the chef at the cafe, was shot in the jaw and the armpit, but doctors managed to take him through surgery and he is now described as comfortable

Evan Hill, who lives above the 
building where the cafe shooting happened, said the venue was an 
artists' collective and performance space.

'It's
 the strangest place to think of a shooting,' said Hill, who heard four 
to five shots.  He said he ran to his balcony and called 911, but didn't 
see a suspect.

In the last month alone, there have been two random killings in the city. Last
 week, a man died when a stray bullet struck him as he and his family 
drove down a Seattle street.

In late April, a woman died of injuries 
suffered in an apparently random drive-by shooting near downtown. No arrests have been made in either of those fatalities.

On
 Saturday, a bystander was wounded near the iconic Space Needle when he 
was struck by a bullet allegedly fired by a gang member involved in a 
dispute with another man, authorities said.

Later that night, about 60 shots were fired in drive-by shootings at four houses. No one was hit.

Besides
 the plan to increase the number of officers on patrol in high-crime 
areas, police are also urging people with information about shootings to
 come forward.

Some city leaders were skeptical those approaches would work.

'We have seen many community vigils, 
community mobilizations. We've heard about these strategies before,' 
Councilman Tom Rasmusen asked at a briefing with police this week.

'What's going to change?' The
 latest spasm of deadly gun violence to hit the city worried Seattle's 
leaders and prompted police to consider increasing patrols in high-crime
 areas.

The three deaths bring the number of homicides to 19 this year, 
compared to 21 in all of last year.
