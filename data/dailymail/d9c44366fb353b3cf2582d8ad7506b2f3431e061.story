The only certainty, at least so far as 10 minutes ago, is that if Amir Khan fights Manny Pacquiao this summer it will not take place at Wembley Stadium.

The HBO pay-TV network in America has determined May 30 as the putative date for that potential blockbuster and the new Wembley is already booked that Saturday for one of the oldest fixtures in our sporting calendar: A little local matter called the FA Cup Final.

Whether Bolton Man and the PacMan actually box each other that day, somewhere, depends on whether the Money Man chooses to fight either or neither of them in Las Vegas four weeks earlier.

Pacquiao visited London but if he does fight Khan, the fight will not be held at Wembley Stadium

If Floyd Mayweather picks one, the other will be left to fight that hardy old regular around the rings, A. N. Other.

If he opts for Miguel Cotto, then Pacquiao and Khan will be looking for a place to conduct their violent but lucrative business.

Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium is a possibility but Las Vegas or New York is more likely, or even Abu Dhabi where extra bucket loads of cash in the form of a massive site fee beckons Khan, the hero of moderate Islam.

Meanwhile ,the wait goes on and the speculation becomes ever more feverish.

Cup a hand to one ear and you hear a respected insider, American TV commentator Jim Lampley, pronouncing definitively: ‘Mayweather is fighting Cotto in Las Vegas on May 2.’

Strain the other ear and you can discern Pacquiao saying: ‘I now expect to be fighting Mayweather next.’

Cock both ears to the fans surrounding Mayweather at a basketball game the other night and you are deafened by chants like these: ‘Fight Manny Pacquiao… We Want Pacquiao.’

Floyd Mayweather is yet to decide who he will fight when he returns to the ring in Las Vegas on May 2 

Mayweather could opt to have a rematch with Miguel Cotto, whom he beat three years ago

Is he listening? Only if this is a shot the pound-for-pound king really wants to call.

Does he care? Perhaps only if his paymasters at the Showtime TV network tell him that these vocal expressions of public opinion indicate the risk of a fall in his pay-per-view ratings if he recycles Cotto, who he outpointed by a desert mile a couple of years ago.

When Pacquiao made his most confident forecast yet that Mayweather would finally agree to the richest fight in boxing history, he did so when within ear-shot of Khan.

That was during their visit to the historic Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in south east London, a grass-roots engagement which Pacquiao fitted in between dinner with Prince Harry at Buckingham Palace and judging the Miss Universe contest in Miami.

Later, for a Sky Sports filming of his visit to London to be screened at 10.15 pm this Wednesday, Pacquiao said: ‘Mayweather claims he’s the No 1 pound for pound, so I want to feel the punches of the No 1 pound for pound,’

With regard to Mayweather’s demands for Olympic standard blood testing, Pacquiao added: ‘He knows blood testing is no the issue. He’s just making up alibis to avoid the fight.’

Neither that narrative nor Cotto’s possibly tell-tale withdrawal from a bout with Canelo Alvarez were music to Khan’s ears, since he harbours his own ambition of boxing Mayweather.

But at least he and his old sparing mate Pacquiao have their Plan B pretty much in place.

Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum – who has to keep rebutting claims from Mayweather’s Money Team that it is he not Floyd who is blocking the biggest one of all – has sounded out the Mandalay Bay arena in Las Vegas and New York’s Barclays Center as the alternatives to Khan’s apparently unworkable Wembley proposition.

It is unlikely that any other venue in Britain could overcome HBO’s reluctance to compromise their optimum Saturday fight-night broadcast schedule, given the trans-Atlantic time difference.

There has been talk of Abu Dhabi bank-rolling a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight to the tune of $300 million but, in the absence of an enthusiastic response, that offer was withdrawn. Arum is among those who would take much convincing of the feasibility of such a project, not least since he is committed to opening up the vast Chinese boxing market through promotions in Macao like the one in which Pacquiao recently thrashed Chris Algieri.

And whither Khan if Mayweather and Pacquiao are occupied with each othe in the Nevada rather than Arabian desert this May?

Wembley would be back in the picture for a proposed Battle of Britain in June if Kell Brook’s promoter Eddie Hearn could tempt Khan to challenge for Special K’s recently won world welterweight belt.

Brook returns from the horrific stab wound suffered in a holiday incident for a routine voluntary defence in Sheffield on March 28 but Khan is already working on his Plan C with Tim Bradley and two men against whom he suffered defeats, Lamont Peterson and Danny Garcia, among possible opponents.

But all depends on whom Mayweather invites to his May ball.

The word is that he will name the anointed one by the start of next week, but like so much else in this soap opera that is pure speculation.

We will keep our ear to the ground.

Kell Brook’s options for a big fight of his own are widening with the arrival in London of Juan Manuel Marquez.

The Mexican legend, who confirmed his Hall of Fame candidacy with that brutal knock-out of Manny Pacquiao, is expected to have mano-a-mano talks with Brook about a summer showdown in England.

Marquez is in town as assistant trainer and star supporter of Daniel Estrada, his countryman who meets Kevin Mitchell in a world lightweight title final eliminator at London’s O2 Arena on Saturday night.

Juan Manuel Marquez's (right) last fight was a unanimous points win over Mike Alvarado last year

Marquez knocked Pacquiao out cold when they met for a third time in Las Vegas in December 2012

However, Marquez is said to be contemplating a challenge to Brook for his world welterweight title if Sheffield’s Special K successfully defends that IBF belt against Jo Jo Dan on his March 28 home-town comeback from stab wounds.

Nacho Beristain, renowned lead trainer of Marquez and Estrada, told Boxing Scene: ‘There is a meeting.

Marquez is coming to the end of a fine career but still cherishes the ambition of becoming Mexico’s first five-weight world champion.’

Beristain says: If Juan can do that it would be fantastic, an ideal way for him to retire. And we’d like a fight with Brook.’

First, Marquez will be firmly in Estrada’s corner for a fight which will also decide which is the strongest power behind a prize-fighter – iconic professional backing or a good woman.

Estrada says: ‘Mitchell is a good fighter but I will be all the stronger for having Juan Manuel behind me, helping me, inspiring me.’

Romford’s Mitchell admits that boozy nights undermined his two world title challenges thus far – against Michael Katsidis and Ricky Burns – but now says: ‘My new girlfriend Jodie has helped me turn away from the drink, improve my diet and focus on my training. I’m all about the boxing now.’

The winner of this one becomes the mandatory challenger to WBC world champion Omar Figueroa.

Mitchell vs Estrada will be televised live on Sky Sports 1 from 8pm on Saturday night.

Anthony Joshua, Britain’s super-heavyweight gold medallist at the London Olympics, had his meteoric rise through the professional ranks interrupted by withdrawal with injury from a co-bill-topping fight at this Saturday’s O2 arena against solid American Kevin Johnson.

That fight is being rescheduled as one of two appearances planned for Joshua by promoter Eddie Hearn in the month of April.

Joshua, who was among the throng of aspiring younger boxers who welcomed Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan to the century old Fitzroy Lodge club on Friday, told me there: ‘It was a stress fracture of the back but it’s getting better. At this stage of my career I want to fight often, like boxers in the old days.’
