CBS has issued an apology after realizing that a man that they interviewed about his actions on the night of the attack in Benghazi  was lying on air.

Dylan Davies previously worked as a security contractor hired by the State Department and he told 60 Minutes that he was not on the ground of the Special Consulate when the attack began on the night of September 11, 2012, but he rushed over as soon as he heard.

After his interview with reporter Lara Logan aired on the show last Sunday, his account began being questioned publicly and though the initially stood by him- believing his claims that he was the subject of a slander attack by the State Department- they issued a public apology for their mistake on Friday.

Mea culpa : Logan said on November 8 (pictured) that they were wrong to air her interview with a man called Dylan Davies who lied about his role on the night of the attacks on the American mission to Benghazi

In hiding: Dylan Davies told a story that has now been proved to be false during a 60 Minutes interview and has since received death threats against his family

‘The most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and today the truth is we made a mistake. That's very disappointing for any journalist, that's very disappointing for me,’ Logan said when she gave an on-air mea culpa during CBS This Morning.

‘Nobody likes to admit that they made a mistake, but if you do, you have to stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong and in this case we were wrong.’

During the original interview, Davies- who went by the pseudonym that he used while writing a book about his version of events, Morgan Jones- said that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived at the consulate on the evening of the attack.

He also said that he later saw the body of Ambassador Chris Stevens when he went to a local hospital that evening.

Now it has been revealed that in 
reports he made both to his company, Blue Mountain Group, and the FBI, 
he said that he never made it to the compound on the night of the 
attack. He said in those reports that he never made it to the Special 
Mission compound until the next morning on September 12.

Logan
 said that they were aware of the discrepancy between the version of 
events that he was telling CBS and the Blue Mountain Group report, 
saying that before they aired the piece he told them that he lied in the
 company’s report to go along with his boss’ story which said that 
Davies tried going to the mission but there were roadblocks and he 
couldn’t make it.

Lies: Davies told 60 Minutes that he scaled a 12-foot wall to get into the compound and then fought a terrorist to the ground once he got inside. He also said he saw the dead body of the American ambassador

‘His boss is someone he cared about enormously. He cared about his American counterparts in the mission that night, and when his boss told him not to go, he couldn't stay back. So that was always part of the record for us,’ Logan said.

She made it clear that what they did 
not know was that Davies had given that account to the FBI in their 
incident report. His involvement with the FBI report came via The 
Washington Post after the 60 Minutes piece aired, and Logan said that 
when they confronted him over the claims, he denied it.

Logan
 said that they have since tried contacting Davies about the situation 
and they have not been able to get in touch with him.

‘We
 were misled and we were wrong and that's the important thing and that's
 what we have to say here: we have to set the record straight and take 
responsibility,’ she said.

Placing the blame: While she repeatedly said 60 Minutes was taking responsibility, she said that they were 'misled' by Davies who did not tell them that he gave a different version of events to the FBI

Davies
 motivation to lie presumably has something to do with the fact that he 
is coming out with a book about alleged warnings that he gave the U.S. 
government about security flaws before the attack.

The publisher of the book, The Embassy House, has now said that they have retracted the book.

Pulled: The publisher announced on Friday that it will stop selling Davies' book

It had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book. Simon & Schuster announced Friday afternoon that 'in light of information that has been brought to our attention' they will no longer be selling the book.

Anyone who purchased the book in the past week since it went on the market can now return it to the publisher, Politico reports.

The book itself was another problem for 60 Minutes because while they did disclose that Davies had a book that was being published, they failed to mention that Threshold Editions is an imprint of Simon & Schuster which is owned by CBS.

CNN said that they got a statement from Davies who said that his book is 'consistent' with what he told U.S. authorities and the FBI, but their own reporter said that there were discrepancies between his book and official reports.

When asked about what steps they took to vet that Davies was telling the truth before they put him on air, Logan said that they did independent research and also used material that he provided.

'We verified that he was who he said he was, that he was working for the State Department at the time, that he was in Benghazi at the Special Mission compound the night of the attack,' she said on CBS' morning news show.

'He gave us access to communications that he had with government officials. we used US government reports and congressional testimony to verify many of the details  of his story and everything checked out. He also showed us photographs that he had taken at the Special Mission compound the following morning.'
