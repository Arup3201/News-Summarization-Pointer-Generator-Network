A teenager who died in a car accident may have crashed because she was concentrating too hard on her new satnav, an inquest was told yesterday.

Laura-Louise Salford, 17, was using the TomTom device for the first time on a trip to the seaside with friends.

It gave no warning of a crossroads and – believing she had the right of way – she drove straight on without slowing down.

Killed: Laura-Louise Salford had passed her driving test a month before she died in May this year

A van smashed into the side of her car, killing her instantly.

Laura-Louise was driving a Toyota 
Aygo that her parents had bought her after  she had passed her driving 
test at the first attempt a few weeks earlier.

On the day of the crash – May 31 – 
she told them she was going to take two friends to a swimming pool near
her home in Rotherham. Instead the trio went on a 60-mile trip to Hull 
and on to the resort of Bridlington.

On the way home the satnav did not indicate that the minor road she was on was about to cross a main road.

Glen Simpson, who was driving the van
that hit her on the crossroads, told the inquest: ‘Out of the corner of
my eye I saw something black. There was nowhere I could go, I collided 
straight into the  side of the car.’

Driving conditions were good and there was no evidence either vehicle was breaking the speed limit.

Ian Clark, an accident investigator, 
followed the route taken by Laura-Louise using the same satnav and 
concluded the student’s over-reliance on the device may have been a 
factor.

‘The road signs are there,’ he said. 
‘They are clearly visible. Why they weren’t seen or observed is not 
possible to comment on.

‘The satnav system they were using is
telling you the next place where you are required to make an adjustment
is a quarter of a mile further on. It is common to all satnav devices I
have examined; if you are travelling and the road is straight on at a 
crossroads, a satnav will give you no indication.

‘I think unwittingly she followed the
satnav religiously and it lulled them into a false sense of the belief 
they had right of way at this junction.’

Laura-Louise’s friends, Anna Johnson 
and Kimberley Wright, were both injured in the accident. Anna said 
Laura-Louise was a careful driver. She told how she was knocked out in 
the crash, adding: ‘I remember waking up and seeing Laura’s face. She 
didn’t speak, she wasn’t moving.’

Rosemary Baxter, Hull assistant 
deputy coroner, recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying it was 
impossible to say why Laura had not stopped at the crossroads.

TomTom refused to comment.
