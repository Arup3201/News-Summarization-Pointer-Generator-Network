A social media expert who was the subject of a nationwide manhunt after authorities searched his San Francisco apartment has been charged with one count of possessing an illegal destructive device

Documents show that a search of a San Francisco social media expert's apartment turned up ball bearings, screws and components needed to make a homemade bomb.

In an affidavit unsealed on Tuesday, FBI Special Agent Michael Eldridge says investigators found the materials inside a bag at the apartment of Ryan Kelly Chamberlain during a search over the weekend.

Eldridge says the bag also contained a screw top glass jar with batteries and a wire, a circuit board and a model rocket motor.

Search: Agents in hazardous material suits are seen as the FBI searches a building in San Francisco. Police said they captured Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II, 42, on Monday, shortly after announcing that they had found his car near the Golden Gate Bridge

The discovery prompted a nationwide 
manhunt for the 42-year-old Chamberlain. He was arrested on Monday and 
has been charged with one count of possession of an illegal destructive 
device.

The FBI has not said what, if any, plans Chamberlain had for the device.

Chamberlain was arrested on Monday in his
 car near Crissy Field, just south of the Golden Gate Bridge after a 
three-day manhunt.

He appeared in federal court on Tuesday in the same shirt and shorts he was arrested in.

The FBI says authorities discovered materials at his home that could have caused great harm to the public.

The 42-year-old Chamberlain was accompanied by a public defender but did not enter a plea.

Charged: Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II has been charged with possessing bomb-making materials in his San Francisco apartment had the pieces necessary to build an improvised explosive device, the FBI and police said

It appears he also sent a suicide note to
 his friends detailing reasons behind his extreme depression and what 
may have led to his having dangerous explosives in his apartment.

Chamberlain scheduled the three-page letter to be sent Monday morning using the service Hootsuite.

Among
 the factors behind his wracked state of mind were his mother's 
religious zealotry, a bad break-up with a woman he called 'the one,' and
 his failed career.

Though it does not specifically say the 
social media expert intended to end his life, the implication appears 
clear in the letter, which Chamberlain ends by writing: 'Thank you. I'm 
sorry. I love you.'

Brooke Wentz, his boss at a music rights consultancy group, said Chamberlain last contacted her Friday to remind her to deposit his paycheck in a new bank account.

The conversation was uneventful and Wentz said she was 'tremendously dumbfounded' by the news that the contractor she had hired to handle her company's social media accounts was wanted by the FBI.

'He's a nice guy,' Wentz said.

She said it didn't seem like Chamberlain was staying in his apartment. When she mailed him his paycheck in April, he told her he would have to go to the apartment to pick it up.

She said he seemed to be under financial pressure because he told her that two friends who were leasing his apartment left without telling him and he had to scramble to pay for two rentals.

'I wondered what kind of friends would do something like that,' Wentz said. 'I tried to ask him about the situation, but he was kind of evading my question.'

Randy Bramblett, a personal trainer, said he became friends with Chamberlain through Project Sport, a sports marketing company.

The company let Chamberlain go when it was sold in November, and he soon lost touch with friends and stopped returning calls and messages, Bramblett said.

Probe: Emergency services outside Chamberlain's apartment. Authorities were on the scene all weekend

Chamblerlain, a San Francisco social media maven and former political consultant who was wanted on suspicion of possessing explosives has been taken into custody after a three-day manhunt

'We all knew that he was a very emotional guy and when he didn't get his
 own way he would say, 'Screw you, I'm going to go do my own thing,'' 
Bramblett said.

'I've never seen him be violent, ever, but I would 
definitely say that maybe emotionally and mentally he was a little 
unstable.'

Chamberlain had worked for years as a political consultant on Democratic campaigns, Bramblett said.

It appears he also sent a suicide note to his friends detailing reasons behind his extreme depression and what may have led to his having dangerous explosives in his apartment.

Chamberlain scheduled the three-page letter to be sent Monday morning using the service Hootsuite.

Among the factors behind his wracked state of mind were his mother's religious zealotry, a bad break-up with a woman he called 'the one,' and his failed career.

Though it does not specifically say the social media expert intended to end his life, the implication appears clear in the letter, which Chamberlain ends by writing: 'Thank you. I'm sorry. I love you.'

Alex
 Clemens, a partner of the San Francisco-based Barbary Coast Consulting,
 said Chamberlain is well known the city's political circles and had 
been a fixture on the campaign trails for more than a decade. His work 
in the field ended several years ago.

Clemens, who briefly hired Chamberlain for a project in 2009, said people who know Chamberlain are stunned.

'I
 believe there's been a failure in his support system. I'm sad for 
that,' Clemens said. 'I hope he will reach out to those who will help 
him.'

Chamberlain also worked as an independent contractor for The 
San Francisco Chronicle during the 2012 NFL season, doing social media 
to boost coverage for the San Francisco 49ers Insider iPad app, the 
newspaper said.

The FBI arrived at Chamberlain's Russian Hill apartment Saturday with a search warrant, only to find him gone

Chamberlain also taught a 'Grass Roots Mobilization' 
course to graduate students in the public affairs program in 2011, said 
Anne-Marie Devine, a spokeswoman for the University of San Francisco.

Chamberlain taught for one semester and wasn't invited to teach another 
course, she said.

She said she didn't know why he was let go because hundreds of adjunct professors come and go at the university.

No longer a threat: A picture of Ryan Chamberlain, a man in his 30s, found on his Twitter and Facebook pages. Chamberlain was the subject of an FBI manhunt after authorities found explosives in his home, but he's no longer considered a public threat

Charged: Chamberlain, pictured with friends, worked as a music and sports writer before getting into PR

Questions: Another image shows him laying on top of a friend. His boss told reporters that he had said a couple of friends had just moved out of his apartment, leaving him to cover their rent
