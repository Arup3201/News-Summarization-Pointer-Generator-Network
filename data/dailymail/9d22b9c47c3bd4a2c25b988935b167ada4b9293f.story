RBS boss Stephen Hester launched an impassioned plea to keep his bonus yesterday as his bumper pay packet was described as ‘modest’.

Mr Hester admitted he was the ‘captain on the bridge’ while his traders rigged interest rates but said he still merited being handed a shares pay-out worth £780,000.

He received the backing of RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who described Mr Hester’s basic pay package of more than £1.6million as ‘modest’ by banking standards.

Sir Philip’s comment was last night described by campaigners as ‘an insult to ordinary taxpayers’, who bailed RBS out to the tune of £45.5billion during the financial crisis.

Mr Hester, Sir Philip and a string of RBS bosses yesterday gave evidence to the Banking Commission of MPs and peers over the Libor rate-rigging scandal – at its worst between 2006 and 2010 – which culminated in a £390million fine from US and UK regulators last week.

The commission warned RBS against ‘creative accounting’ over plans to recoup £300million in bonuses from employees to pay American regulators. Mr Hester said he accepted ultimate responsibility as the ‘captain on the bridge’ since he took the helm of RBS in November 2008, shortly after it was rescued.

But he faced awkward questions over why only one senior manager, investment bank chief John Hourican, has resigned over the wrongdoing.

He was also asked why he was clinging on to the £780,000 shares bonus awarded in 2010, which will be transferred to him next month. Mr Hester, who already receives a basic £1.2million salary and a £420,000 cash payment instead of a pension, can cash the shares in a year later.

His fate was contrasted with that of Mr Hourican, who was forced to hand back at least £4million in bonuses.

Banking Commission chairman Andrew Tyrie, who suggested Mr Hourican had been made into a ‘human shield’ for the debacle, said: ‘Mr Hourican has paid with his job. Do you not think you should pay with your bonus?’

Mr Hester said his bonus ‘should be assessed on all the things I do’, adding: ‘If you look at the RBS we took on four years ago that we have done huge things to rescue a situation for the company and for society and stakeholders.

‘This includes hundreds of billions of pounds of risk that the country was exposed to and isn’t any more.’

The bank boss claimed he was responsible for defusing ‘the biggest balance sheet time bomb in corporate history’.

Over the last four years, RBS has removed £700billion of toxic assets from its balance sheet.

Mr Hester was supported by chairman Sir Philip, who argued that he is paid ‘well below the market rate for bankers’.

Sir Philip also pointed out that Mr Hester, who is eligible for a maximum annual package of £7.1million, has given up his bonus three times in four years.

Asked why only Mr Hourican has fallen on his sword, Sir Philip said: ‘We decided a single point of accountability was necessary – not a mass series of assassinations’. But the comments about Mr Hester’s pay infuriated critics.

Deborah Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre think-tank, said: ‘The idea that Mr Hester is paid modestly is insulting to taxpayers and people on average salaries.

‘There are big question marks over whether he deserves his bonus when the rigging of interest rates continued for two years under his watch.’
