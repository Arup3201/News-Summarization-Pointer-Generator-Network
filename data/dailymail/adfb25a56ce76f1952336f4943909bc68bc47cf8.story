A young couple found passed out and high on synthetic marijuana as their eight-month-old son sat in the back seat of the car have been charged, according to police.

Paramedics had to physically wake Brooke Amber Michael and Michael Patrick May, both 20, after finding them unresponsive in the parking lot of a Maryland McDonald's on Saturday evening.

Packages of synthetic marijuana, or K2, and smoking devices were allegedly found inside the car when the pair were arrested.

Baltimore Sun reported that Michael and May stumbled and slurred their speech when Anne Arundel County police ordered them out of the car on Generals Highway in Annapolis.

The couple was charged with neglect of a minor and possession of drug paraphernalia.

The baby boy, who was alert,  was taken to Anne Arundel Medical Center for 
evaluation, and Child Protective Services was notified. The infant was later 
released to his grandfather.

Synthetic marijuana, also known as 'fake weed', is a readily available mixture of herbs, spices or shredded plant that's sprayed with a synthetic compound chemically similar to THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.

It can cause hallucinations, dysphoria and extreme paranoia.
