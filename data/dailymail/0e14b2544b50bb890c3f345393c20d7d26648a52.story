A policeman's dog sparked an emergency of her own after she managed to survive a 120ft drop chasing a seagull off the edge of a cliff.

Phil Raymond and wife Michela half-expected their springer spaniel Beau to have died as they peered over the edge of the sheer drop, but were stunned to see her doggy-paddling in the sea below.

She was rescued by a lifeboat crew who plucked her to safety and returned her to her owners, amazingly, without a scratch.

Mr Raymond, a 46-year-old police detective inspector, saw Beau race after the seagull while they were walking at the coastal beauty spot of Old Harry Rocks, near Swanage, Dorset.

The 46-year-old, from Wimborne, Dorset, desperately tried to call the one-year-old dog back as she plunged over the top of the sheer cliff.

When he rushed to the edge and peered over the side he was stunned to see Beau swimming in the sea at the bottom.

A passing fishing boat motored across to the stranded pooch and kept an eye on her until a lifeboat crew arrived and plucked her to safety.

Incredibly, the black and white dog survived her ordeal without a single scratch and was quickly reunited with her relieved owners.

Mr Raymond said: 'We were just about to put her lead back on her when she saw a seagull.

Returned: Beau was returned to her thankful owners Phil and Michela Raymond by the RNLI crew after they watched her jump off the edge of the cliff

Survivor: Beau is now enjoying life back home again following the dramatic rescue after her fall

'Being a springer spaniel she went straight after it. She briefly looked back at me but then disappeared.

'I prayed it was a false edge and there was a little ledge below.

'I lay on the surface and looked over the edge and half-expected to see her laying dead but instead saw her doggy-paddling in the sea.

'She was very lucky that there was a high tide at the time and she landed straight in the water.

Lucky dog: Beau was returned to her owners without a scratch following the rescue

'She was crying and yelping and we thought that she might drown but luckily the lifeboat turned up very quickly and grabbed hold of her.'

The lifeboat crew from Swanage took Beau to a nearby beach where she was given back to her owners.

Mrs Raymond, 44, said: 'We are extremely grateful to the lifeboat crew for getting to Beau so quickly.'

Stunned: Mrs Raymond and her husband were amazed when they looked over the side of the cliff to see Beau paddling in the water below

Dave Turnbull, an RNLI spokesperson, said: 'We help save human lives at sea, but will respond to animals in trouble to prevent owners taking unnecessary risks to help their pets.

'The RNLI recommend that people keep their dogs on leads when walking near cliff edges.

'The dog was lucky to escape the fall unscathed thanks to the high tide.'

Grateful: Phil and Michela Raymond have now thanked the RNLI for rescuing their dog from bottom of the cliff
