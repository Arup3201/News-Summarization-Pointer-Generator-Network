A large fire tore through a nearly 140-year-old prison on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of more than 200 inmates.

There were no reported inmate or staff injuries.

The prison in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, appeared to have been totally destroyed, county officials said.

Flames shoot through the roof of the Northumberland County Prison on Wednesday. Dispatchers say the blaze was reported just after 2 p.m. at the nearly 140-year-old jail

The prison sits in the middle of Sunbury, Pennsylvania, in close proximity to homes and businesses, and just two blocks from the Susquehanna River

The cause of the fire was not immediately known.

The blaze was reported Wednesday afternoon at the prison in Sunbury, a city of 10,000 residents about 40 miles north of Harrisburg, the state capital.

Intense flames and thick smoke shot through the roof.

The prison, a stone building with castle-like parapets, was built in the late-1800s and sits a few blocks off the banks of the Susquehanna River in close proximity to homes and businesses.

All 208 inmates were initially taken under heavy guard to a nearby church.

Commissioner Stephen Bridy said that all inmates were accounted for.

Warden Bruce Kovach confirmed that there had been no injuries.

County Commissioner Chairman Vinny Clausi said the building appeared to be a 'total loss'.

Sunbury Fire Chief Ken Kipple said in a press conference once the fire had been brought under control, that it was challenging  to tackle having to work around law enforcement and evacuations from the secure facility. 

County officials said the male and female inmates were being moved to separate state prisons nearby, and a neighboring county agreed to house new inmates brought in following the fire. 

Female inmates have been moved to SCI Muncy in Lycoming County, a state facility that typically houses medium to maximum-security female prisoners, WNEP 16 reported. The male inmates have been moved south to the state facility in Coal Township.

Officials are not giving too many details away about the prison transfers as securely moving inmates from one location to another creates a delicate situation.
