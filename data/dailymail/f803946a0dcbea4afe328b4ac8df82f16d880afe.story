Soldiers have been reminded who they are supposed to salute after senior officers complained they were not being enough shown respect by the lower ranks.

The Ministry of Defence issued guidance on the hierarchy of military ranking after Army, Navy and RAF chiefs said younger officers were not saluting the right people.

While a missed salute may seem like a petty complaint, there have been instances of top brass being called 'boss' or 'mate' by servicemen.

Soldiers have been reminded who they are supposed to salute after top brass complained they were not being shown proper respect by lower ranks

The reminder, entitled the Pecking Order, suggested that the problem was growing because of an increase in joint operations between branches of the military, with soldiers unsure which members of other services they are supposed to salute.

An RAF source told the Daily Telegraph: 'There's been some concern that this has been going on. This has been pushed forward hard by top brass and it appeared in the journal after a prod from someone high up.

'It's been done in a light-hearted manner, but behind it, it's pretty serious.'

The guide, published in an in-house MoD journal, says: 'As anyone who works in defence knows, there are clearly defined rank structures. But, while the pecking order may be clear within your own Service, equivalent ranks or grades in the other Services may be less apparent.

'With joint operations becoming increasingly common and many bases run by a mix of uniformed and civilian MoD staff, you need to know where you stand.

'If nothing else, we hope this helps you know whom you should salute and to find your way to the correct mess.'

Another military source said: 'You would be amazed by some of the greetings [from young officers to those above them in the hierarchy].'

While another added: 'Over the last decade, some have been very informal with each other. They often refer to a senior officer as boss, rather than sir. Some accept it, but others want to be called sir. It's been a minor problem for some time, but they are trying to keep it very much in check.'
