'Hypocrisy': Richard Drax MP has planned to coat his estate with solar panels

A millionaire Tory MP has infuriated his neighbours with plans to build an enormous solar farm on his sprawling estate.

Richard Drax was last night facing claims of hypocrisy after proposals to put scores of solar panels on 174 acres of his land were submitted to planners.

Local residents in Dorset point out that three months ago Mr Drax attacked plans to increase subsidies for wind turbines and solar panels.

He also led opposition to a proposed wind farm off the Dorset coast.

But the Harrow-educated politician now wants to build a solar farm the size of  110 football pitches on his 7,000-acre  Charborough Estate.

Leading the fight against the South  Dorset MP’s plans is Sir Michael Butler, a retired Foreign Office civil servant, who says he has already defeated a previous proposal for a wind farm on the same site.

Sir Michael, 86, is among more than 300 people who have written to the planning authority about the solar project. He told the Mail: ‘If this plan was to go ahead it would be an absolute disaster.

‘This is a most beautiful part of the  British countryside and they want to stick this abomination in the middle of it.’

Tony Pollard, 85, who is retired from the RAF, added: ‘There’s been a lot of chuntering about all this.

‘Bearing
 in mind [Mr Drax’s] previous comments ...  in which he seemed to be 
opposed to subsidies for wind and solar farms there are those who might 
consider him something of a hypocrite.’

Mr Drax, 55 – full name Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax – has said the opinion of the local community was sought before the application was submitted ‘and will continue to be incorporated’.

He said the site is well screened and will be planted with a ‘wildflower-rich grass sward’. A  community fund would also be established to benefit the area.

He declined to answer questions from the Mail on how much income he would receive from the solar farm or to address claims that he is a hypocrite for backing the scheme.

Under fire: Angry locals have tried to block the plans

A statement on his behalf said: ‘The Charborough Estate is working with renewable energy provider Good Energy in considering the suitability of field-scale solar energy projects on land which it owns.

‘There is a strong and increasing need for additional sources of renewable energy. ‘

A spokesman for Good Energy said: ‘The project will play an important role in improving the UK’s energy security, as well as reducing its carbon emissions.’

Solar power was supported financially by the Government to encourage its growth, he said.

‘There is no direct subsidy paid to Mr Drax related to this project,’ added the spokesman. ‘Good Energy has an agreement to lease the land from the estate and pay rent accordingly.’
