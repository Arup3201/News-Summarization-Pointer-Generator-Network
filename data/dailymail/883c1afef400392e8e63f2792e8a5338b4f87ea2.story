People in England are losing more than a million years of life every year due to conditions caused by poor lifestyle, figures show.

Up to 50,000 premature deaths annually could be prevented if people were healthier, lived in better housing and had regular check-ups with doctors.

If the early deaths are added up, they show that in men a total of two million years were lost between 2009 and 2011 while 1.6 million were lost in women.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned there is ‘shocking and unnecessary’ variation in premature deaths across the country and pledged to narrow the gap.

Figures from the Information Centre for Health and Social Care show that around 50,000 people die an average of 20 years too soon in England every year.

They include deaths from cancer, heart disease and diabetes - caused by smoking, alcohol and a bad diet - as well as those from chest infections triggered by poor housing.

The data includes a small number of babies who are either stillborn or die in the first weeks of life - often triggered by their mothers smoking or being obese.

But there is huge variation across the country with people in Bradford around three times more likely to die early than those in Hampshire.

And the inhabitants of Surrey, Sussex and the Home Counties are 1.5 times less likely to die prematurely than those living in Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside.

Public health experts also pointed out that poor housing with inadequate heating and damp conditions was leading to the deaths of thousands of the elderly.

Jeremy Hunt said: ‘There is a shocking variation in early and unnecessary deaths across the country which I am determined to start putting right as part of my ambition to save 30,000 lives a year by 2020.

‘Local authorities have been given the power and budget to tackle the needs of their local population.’

But Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said major social changes were needed to reduce the death roll.

He said: ‘We hear all the rhetoric of localism but this country continues to be one of the most centralised countries in Europe. Are they really going to return power to the local level so they can do something?

‘It ought to be a matter of profound embarrassment to us that we’ve got children who aren’t fed properly, aren’t clothed properly.

‘We’ve got two, three, four generations who haven’t had access to work. There are very low aspirations. Parents don’t want their children to go away in search of jobs. We want children to be able to aspire.”

‘People living in older private rented housing, they don’t have modern heating, pensions only allow them to keep one room warm and they go up to bed in a cold bedroom.’

Matthew Fagg, deputy director for reducing premature mortality at NHS England - the new body in charge of running the health service - said: ‘These variations should never be deemed acceptable and NHS England is committed to addressing them.’
