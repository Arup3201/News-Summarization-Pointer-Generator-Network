A married mother of two has been charged with killing her seven-month-old daughter in Clarksville, Tennessee, while bathing her on Friday.

Stefany Johnson, 24, told police that ‘Jesus came down’ and took her daughter to heaven while she was washing her, according to an arrest warrant.

Clarksville police called at her home at 3:40 a.m. on Friday after receiving reports of a woman yelling and screaming, as well as being naked in the road.

When police arrived, Johnson was uncooperative and belligerent, according to her arrest warrant.

Officers found seven-month-old Astrid Johnson’s body on the couch upon entering the home and found no evidence of attempts to provide medical care for her.

When later asked by police what happened, Johnson told them, ‘Jesus came down and took Astrid to heaven’ while she was bathing her.

Police concluded that Johnson’s negligence resulted in the child’s death and she has been charged with criminal homicide, reports The Tennessean.
