Venture out onto this dizzying walkway and you'd be well advised not to look down... but then again, that's rather the point.

The Welterbeblick Skywalk hovers 360 metres above one of Austria's most famous lakes with a panoramic view of the alpine village of Hallstatt, a World Heritage site of unbeatable natural beauty.

The gangway, which opened to the public yesterday, extends 12 metres into the abyss, weighs about 200 tonnes and cost 240,000 euros to build.

Below is the village of Hallstatt, an ancient salt mine that is still in use today where its designers hope the new attraction will bring more tourists to the area.

'Many visitors to Hallstatt visit the salt mines in a whistle-stop tour, not leaving much time to take in the area's natural beauty,' said Kurt Thomanek, director of  Salzwelten, the salt mine and tourist attraction that built the structure.

'They often travel through Europe too quickly and miss out on the many great things to do.

'We hope the walkway will change this,' he added.

World Heritage sight: Dozens of tourists, and many locals, flocked to the skywalk to get the first taste of this knee-wobblingly high attraction

The village, and its surrounding area, is so picturesque that China is building a replica Alpine village in a grimy industrial city.

It hopes the chalets in the southern city of Huizhou will be sought after by homesick Europeans.

The village will be a £5.7billion copy of Hallstatt in Austria, complete with artificial lake. Posing as tourists, the Chinese have been photographing every building there for three years.

The plan was discovered when a Chinese guest at Hallstatt’s hotel left behind a bundle of blueprints.

China already has Chengdu British Town, modelled on Dorchester, and Thames Town, near Shanghai.
