A junior doctor was laughed at by a senior colleague when she suggested a consultant should examine a four-year-old girl who died hours later, an inquest has heard.

Freya Wells died after she was administered antibiotics orally to treat a severe infection, the hearing was told.

But when junior doctor Hilary Towse repeatedly raised her concerns about the treatment she claims she was made to feel 'ridiculous' and 'laughed' at by a senior doctor.

Freya Wells, 4, died at Kingston Hospital in Surrey (pictured) from a severe infection after doctors failed to give her antibiotics by the correct method, a hearing was told

Freya had been vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea for around three days when she was admitted to Kingston hospital in south west London after her condition did not improve following a visit to a GP, the inquest heard.

When she arrived at the hospital on November 21st, 2012, she had an infection and was also suffering from breathing difficulties. She was quickly transferred to the paediatric Sunshine Ward.

West London Coroner’s Court heard that in A&E, Registrar Rosita Ibrahim prescribed Freya oral antibiotics, but that her junior colleague and nurses did not agree with that course of treatment.

Fatal mistake: The inquest heard that other medics felt the antibiotics should have been administered intravenously not orally

Doctor Towse told the inquest that she thought the four-year-old should have been receiving intravenous antibiotics.

She said that around 1am the following morning when she saw Dr Ibrahim she again expressed her concerns.

Dr Towse said: 'I specifically said that she needed to have a bolus [fluids straight into the blood].

'I specifically said that she needed to have IV antibiotics, and I specifically said that I thought she needed intensive care.'

However, she added: 'She (Dr Ibrahim) seemed to be able at each point to give a reason.'

Breaking down in tears, Dr Towse added: 'She thought that what I was saying was ridiculous - I recall that she laughed.'

The court heard that the response Dr Towse received led her to believe that perhaps she was 'over-reacting' but also that her senior was 'under-reacting'.

Dr Towse continued: 'I felt I was repeatedly raising my concerns about what I thought was going on and she, to me, would acknowledge it and take it on board, but didn’t agree.'

When Freya’s condition deteriorated later that night and Dr Towse could not initially reach Dr Ibrahim, she considered contacting a consultant, but was eventually able to get through to the doctor.

Dr Towse was asked by Shaheen Raham, 
representing Dr Ibrahim, why she had not called for a consultant herself
 if she was so worried.

She
 replied: 'It will always be something I regret for the rest of my life -
 it would never normally be the role of the SHO [senior house officer] 
to do that.

'But
 I had some experience where I had been entirely appropriate to speak to
 consultants, but they had not listened to me because I was an SHO.'

The
 inquest heard that after Freya’s vomit became 'coffee coloured' Dr 
Towse took it upon herself to deliver intravenous antibiotics, but was 
part-way through the procedure when Dr Ibrahim returned from a crash 
call elsewhere in the hospital and inserted the line herself.

The inquest heard that Freya died the following morning at 5.45am after suffering from septic shock.

Assistant
 coroner Dr Sean Cummings told Dr Ibrahim that many clinicians have 
given evidence that they asked her about the antibiotics.

West London Coroner's Court heard that in A&E, Registrar Rosita Ibrahim prescribed Freya oral antibiotics, but that her junior colleague and nurses did not agree with that course of treatment

'There seems to have been a great concern that Freya should have been given IV antibiotics,' he said.

'Everybody seems to be clear that you decided that wasn't going to be the case.'

Dr Ibrahim, who first saw the girl at 10pm the previous evening, told the court that, despite Freya's high heart and respiratory rates, she followed guidelines which stated that children suffering from severe pneumonia should be given oral antibiotics to reduce their discomfort.

But she said it was planned for the next dose of antibiotics - due at 7am - to be given by IV.

'I realise now it should not have been the case,' she said. 'She should have received intravenous antibiotics right after her vomit in A&E.'

Dr Ibrahim accepted Mr Baker's assertion that it should have taken 'a matter of minutes' to see that Freya was seriously ill.

'I just simply did not appreciate how unwell Freya was,' she added.

Dr Ibrahim insisted that she had 'no recollection' of laughing 'at anything' on that night, and told the inquest that, from her memory, the only staff member who came to her with concern was Dr Towse.

'I have been over that evening so many times in my head and I cannot recollect multiple people coming up to me and telling me how concerned they are,' she said.

'It is my normal practice to listen to nurses. They are very experienced. If they are concerned then I take it on board.'

She added: 'Had I known that the nurses were very worried about her I would have just called the consultant straight away.'

The inquest was adjourned until 10am tomorrow, when the final evidence is expected to be heard.
