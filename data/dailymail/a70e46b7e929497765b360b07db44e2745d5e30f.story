A woman who once tipped the scales at 800 pounds but who was jilted by her fiancé after losing almost half her body weight has found love again and is once again hoping to become America's largest bride.

Susanne Eman, 36, from Arizona had slimmed down to 450 pounds in 2013 ahead of her scheduled wedding to chef Parker Clack.

The bride-to-be had gone so far as having a wedding gown made with 45 yards of material - the equivalent to half a football field in length.

But just days before they were due to marry, Susanne was jilted by fiancé Clack who was unhappy about her weight loss.

Despite making over $90,000 a year as a Big Beautiful Woman (BBW), the 'gainer' had checked into a slimming clinic after her children revealed they were worried about her health.

'Everything was supposed to be perfect and then he split,' she told Inside Edition.

Heartbroken by being dumped but, worse yet, Susanne said she was also unhappy with her new figure.

'What bothered me was seeing my body shrink. I felt absolutely tiny,' she said.

Susanne vowed to regain her lost weight and immediately began eating more to regain the weight she lost. She's now back up to 600 pounds.

As well as regaining her previous figure, Susanne has also revealed that she's found love again.

Boyfriend Nick Abbate is 36 years old and a chef just like her previous fiance. He too once was morbidly obese, but now weighs 168 pounds.

The couple met online and Abbate enjoys nothing more than preparing mammoth meals for his partner. 'She likes to eat,' he said

Abbate has written several books weight loss and nutrition, but says he doesn't want Susanne to lose a single pound.

'I find her very sexy and very attractive.' he said.

He told Inside Edition that he is supportive of his girlfriend's goal to be the heaviest woman in America.

'She likes to eat,' he revealed.

Susanne hit the headlines in 2011 when she first revealed that she wanted to become the world's fattest women.

Weighing just over 750 pounds at the time she and her then feeder fiance chef Clack planned for her to reach a target weight of 1600 pounds within 10 years.

The couple had met online and within months of first exchanging emails Parker had moved in with Susanne and her sons Brendin, now 15, and Gabriel, now 19.

Unemployed Susanne said at the time: We are a match made in heaven. I love eating and Parker loves cooking. He loves larger women and sees how happy I am when I'm eating. His cooking skills were definitely part of the attraction. How could I resist a man with talents in the kitchen?'

The couple were engaged to be married and Susanne upped her food intake to a terrifying 30,000 calories per day as she strove to become the fattest ever bride.

As part of a feature for Inside Edition at the time the couple revealed some of their preparations for the wedding, including the creation of a XXXXXXXXXL wedding dress featuring 42 feet of chiffon.

In preparation for her final fitting, Susanne feasted on enormous breakfasts of pancakes, Belgian waffles, hash browns, sausage links, steak, and a giant 12-egg omelette. 

And on the day of her appointment with the seamstress she made a pit stop for snacks, arriving at the dressmaker's with a spread of three guacamole bacon cheeseburgers, two orders of chili cheese fries, nine tacos, a chocolate shake and a large Coke.

As the months went by Susanne got to her heaviest ever weight, 800 pounds, but her sons were so worried about her health that she agreed to abort her life-threatening mission and instead started to make changes to her lifestyle.

Susanne checked into a residential weight-loss clinic in June 2012 where she was put on 1,500 calories food limit and spent up to five hours exercising each day.

While her health started to improve as she lost weight her relationship suffered as fiance Parker began to miss her huge size. 

The couple split in October 2012, and though Susanne continued on her quest to lose weight, dropping to 450 pounds when she checked out of the facility in March 2013.
