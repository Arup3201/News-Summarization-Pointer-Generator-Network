Two young children were fighting for their lives today after two of their friends died alongside them in an urban pond on the outskirts of Paris.

The horrific drama unfolded on Saturday when a total of five boys and girls aged between three and eight entered the water in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumone, in the Val d’Oise department, north of the French capital.

All of the victims, the sons and daughters of single mothers, were found floating in the unsupervised pond near a local council-run hotel close to hotel where they all lived.

The pond at Saint-Ouen-l'Aumone, where the five children fell in yesterday

The pond is in an industrial area of Saint-Ouen-l'Aumone, on the outskirts of Paris

Policemen arrived to examine the pond where it is believed one child initially fell in, then the others tried unsuccessfully to rescue him

Police believe they all entered the water while playing alone, with their mothers unaware of where they were.

The hotel where all the children were living hosts poor families who are considered particularly vulnerable.

The two youngsters who died were believed to be aged three and five, while the two still in intensive care are both eight.

According to preliminary reports compiled by detectives, one child fell into the pond, while the others tried to rescue him.

Emergency services arrived on the outskirts of Paris where the children were found unconscious in the water

Police were called to the scene by a hotel employee who was alerted to the tragedy by another child

'In the later afternoon we received 
information that five children were struggling to survive in a pond in a
business park and close to a hotel,’ said a local police spokesman.

'It appears that one had fallen in, and the others were trying to get him out. But they all got into difficulty, especially as there was no adult supervising them.'

However, Eric Maurel, the Pontoise prosecutor who is leading the investigation, said: ‘The enquiry has just begun – not all of the facts are available to us.’

Manuel Valls, France’s Interior Minister, expressed its ‘sympathy and sadness over this tragedy’ in a statement to AFP, France national news agency.

Resident Mickael Flour, who lives with his family in a caravan close to the pond, said children often played by the water

The children who were playing unattended reportedly lived in a hotel which housed vulnerable families

He said he 'fully supports the young 
victims and their families’ and wanted to 'pay tribute to all' those 
involved in the rescue of 'these children in distress'.

Mickael Flour, a father-of-four who lives in a trailer near the scene of the tragedy, said : 'You often see kids throwing sticks and stones into the water.'

Sylviana Ternus, who also lives in a caravan nearby, said 'the children were often alone, without an adult with them.'
