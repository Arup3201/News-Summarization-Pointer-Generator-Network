Does your other half constantly put you down or treat you badly - then when you react, act as if YOU are the crazy one and accuse you of being 'oversensitive' or 'paranoid'?

Worse still, have you started to believe them? If so, you may be the victim of 'gaslighting'.

‘Gaslighting’ describes any relationship with a power imbalance, where one partner emotionally manipulates the other into doubting their own perception of reality.

The term has in fact been around for over 60 years - it comes from 
the play Gaslight which was made into a film in 1944, starring Ingrid Bergman. In the movie, Bergman's husband tricks her into thinking she's going insane.

'Gaslighting' is where one partner manipulates the other into doubting their own perception of reality.

However, it's become a psychology buzzword recently, with psychologists recognising and publishing on the subject.

Now, writer Elizabeth Forbes has tackled the phenomenon in her new novel, The Nearest Thing To Crazy.

In the book, a novelist moves to a new village and finds herself prey to emotional abuse.

The main theme of the book is about psychological manipulation - in 
other words, gaslighting - used to undermine someone to the extent that they begin to doubt their sanity

Although it can occur in any relationship; within families, between boss and employee and even friends, it most commonly occurs within romantic relationships. According to psychologists, men most often target women in this way, although some women are 'gaslighters' too.

Speaking to MailOnline, author Elizabeth Forbes says the image of a weak victim is entirely wrong for gaslighting: ‘The women I’ve talked to who have experienced gaslighting abuse are often strong, intelligent women.

‘It is almost as if their developed sense of rationality acts as a conduit for the abuse to flourish. One judges other people’s behaviour by the standards we set for ourselves, and if we wouldn’t lie about such things, if we would consider such manipulation to be devious and immoral, we find it difficult to believe that others could behave in such a way, especially those who profess to love us.

Ingrid Bergman starred in the film 'Gaslight' in which she is tricked by her husband into believing she is mad and has lost touch with reality

New novel 'Nearest thing to Crazy' by Elizabeth Forbes (pictured left) tells the story of a woman who becomes prey to gaslighting

'It is more logical, perhaps, to accept that the fault must lie with ourselves.’

Additionally Elizabeth explains that the dynamic develops subtly:

‘Gaslighters keep their victims close, and the abuse starts off slowly, almost imperceptibly until it escalates to a level where the victim’s self-doubt trumps all else. ‘No one else would have you...’ ‘I don’t know why I put up with you you’re such a screwed up mess...’ ‘You’re lucky I don’t leave you...’

While it might be easy to advise reaching out to others to help the person reassert their worth, and confirm that they are not irrational and that it is their partner who is behaving badly, this is not always easy.

So, the man in your life says to you: ‘I did NOT have my hand on her bosom! Honestly, I don’t know how you could say such a thing.’ But you saw it with your own eyes.

‘I don’t know how you could accuse me of that. I love you, I feel really hurt that you should even think that.’

You know you saw it. But he’s so vehement, so convincing, that there’s just a teeny little shadow of doubt. Could you be wrong? Was the light playing tricks? He wouldn’t lie to you so convincingly, or be so obviously affronted, would he? Could he?

Another time he says: ‘I told you I wasn’t going to be home until after midnight... that I’d got a meeting out of town. Your memory is so bad these days – I’m beginning to worry about you.’ And actually, you know that your memory isn’t what it was. So perhaps he’s right.

The fact is that these seemingly innocuous incidents can begin to wear you down; taken to extremes, over a prolonged period of time, they can begin to make you doubt your sanity.

Elizabeth explains: ‘When one’s sanity is questioned to the extent that one begins to believe it might be crumbling, talking to friends can also be a terrifying option.

‘What if they confirm our neuroses, albeit in a clumsily well-meaning way that they imagine will make us feel better? ‘I’m sure he wouldn’t do that.

It’s obvious how much he loves you.’ Or the oft quoted response: ‘my husband does exactly the same... it’s normal marriage. Just ignore it.’

‘And once more the victim’s view of herself as irrational and neurotic is confirmed.’

Psychologist and relationship expert Susan Quilliam says: ‘Gaslighting usually happens when one partner feels threatened or wrong footed in their life for some reason’

‘It may not be deliberate or conscious, but their realty becomes more important than their partners.

'The relationship may have been good for years, and continue to have positive aspects, so the other partner has no reason to believe that their partner is imposing his reality onto them.

‘It is a type of bullying and the longer it goes on the more they buy into the partner’s reality and lose their own.

‘What keeps it going is silence on behalf of the partner being bullied. My advice for anyone in this situation would be to seek someone objective to talk to about it, then speak to your partner about it, preferably with evidence of their behaviours.’

The Nearest Thing To Crazy by Elizabeth Forbes is published by Cutting Edge Press and is available on Amazon.
