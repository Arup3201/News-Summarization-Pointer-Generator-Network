Anyone who has watched The Great Escape couldn’t fail to remember the dramatic scene.

After tunnelling out of a prisoner of war camp, two British escapees are caught out by replying in English to a suspicious Gestapo official who wishes them ‘good luck’.

But perhaps post office boss Amritpal Mehat had never seen the film – for a similar slip-up has landed him with a four-year jail sentence for stealing more than £400,000.

After being arrested, Mehat, 26,  was 
desperate to convince authorities he suffered from severe mental health 
problems and should not be sent to prison.

He pretended to have been ‘struck dumb by God’ and it was claimed that he had not uttered a word in more than a year.

A judge referred Mehat to a mental hospital and he took part in a month of consultations – remaining mute throughout.

But much like Flight Lieutenant Andy 
MacDonald in the 1963 film, he slipped up when a psychiatrist wished him
‘good luck’ in  Punjabi – and he blew his cover by replying ‘thank you’
in his native tongue.

His mental health assessment was abandoned and he was jailed after being found guilty of theft and conspiracy to steal.

'Wicked deception': Judge Bernard Lever told the defendant his ruse had the Crown 'jumping through forensic hoops for two years'

After hearing of his conversation with
the psychiatrist, a jury unanimously decided he was ‘mute by malice’ 
rather than ‘mute by visitation of God’.

At his sentencing at Minshull Street 
Crown Court in Manchester, Mehat, who lived in an £800,000 house with 
his family in Sheffield, spoke again – this time to confirm his name and
his guilty plea. Judge Bernard Lever told him: ‘This was a wicked 
deception. You have had the crown jumping through forensic hoops for two
years.

‘A large number of experts were called
to examine you at vast public expense. I ordered you to hospital for a 
month where you were unable to maintain your silence, though you had a 
good go.’

Mehat stole £408,000 from Droylsden 
Post Office, Greater Manchester, between November 2008 and January 2009 
to ‘stave off disaster’ for his family business.
