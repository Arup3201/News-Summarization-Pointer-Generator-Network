For most men, giving a father of the bride speech is one of the proudest moments of their lives.

But after IT consultant Irving Caplan was paralysed in a cycling accident, he feared he may have to address guests at his daughter's wedding from a wheelchair.

However, thanks to the latest in robotic technology, the 55-year-old walked across the dance floor of a wedding venue last month and delivered his speech standing up.

Tetraplegic Irving Caplan shocked guests at his daughter's wedding by crossing the floor using bionic legs and standing to make his father of the bride speech

His daughter Joanne said it was the 'moment of the wedding' after Mr Caplin borrowed the device for the day

Mr Caplan, from Stanmore, Middlesex, broke three vertebrae when he collided with a lorry in Edgware, north-west London on his morning cycle to work two years ago.

After undergoing a series of operations and spending 12 days in intensive care, he was left tetraplegic and needing a wheelchair to get around.

When his daughter Joanne announced she was to marry fiancé Mike Beaumont, Mr Caplan feared he would be unable to walk his daughter down the aisle or deliver his speech standing up.

But after he and wife Karen, 57, met a representative of Rex Bionics at an exhibition of technologies for the disabled, he was lent the robotic suit to allow him to stand and walk.

The legs contain 29 computer processors which communicate 3,000 a messages a second to each other

The motors can carry a person weighing up to 15 stone have been used by 50 people, clocking up 4,000 hours of walking.

They are currently estimated at costing £97,000 but makers believe they can get the price down to £40,000.

The benefits are not confined to the mobility of users, as the upright position also reduces the risks of users developing other health problems.

They are currently being tested by the US military in rehabilitation centres for wounded servicemen.

He told MailOnline: 'The guests were gobsmacked when I walked out. It was the usual speech, thanking everyone for coming and hoping everybody had a good evening, but I certainly surprised them all with my entrance.

'It wasn't possible for a number of reasons for me to walk Joanne down the aisle, but I was able to do my speech standing up.

'It is quite an issue when you end up in a wheelchair, being at the wrong height compared to everybody else. But being able to speak to everybody from the right height did make quite a difference.

'It made a difference to me in the sense that I was doing it from the right perspective.

'The day was wonderful. It was everything you would hope your daughter's wedding day to be. Unfortunately I could not do everything I would have wanted to do, but this certainly helped.'

Mr Caplan made the three-minute, 30-pace walk across the hall of Sopwell House, St Albans last month to gasps from guests, who had no idea what he had planned.

Joanne, 29, said: 'I knew what he was going to do but the only times he had tried it before, I had been at work, so it was still very emotional to see him walk across the room.

'It was important to him to be able to do as much at the wedding as he would have been able to do before he had the accident, so it was amazing.

'Most of the guests knew him pre-accident and post-accident and for them it was pretty emotional too because it is nice to see him upright and at the same level as you.'

Wedding organisers played a soundtrack of Walking on the Moon, Walking Back to Happiness and You'll Never Walk Alone, and Mr Caplan said: 'There wasn't a dry eye in the house'.

Mr Caplan said the bionic legs made a huge difference to his experience of his daughter's big day

 

The 'exoskeleton suit', which is controlled by a joystick and a series of computers and motors, was lent to Mr Caplan for the day.

Mr Caplan added: 'There are a number similar technologies being developed and they are all in very early stages.

'It is worth about £97,000 so it is not something I could just stick on the credit card or be able to afford any time soon, but it made a big difference.'

Brian Carlin, of charity Aspire, who Mr Caplan supports, said: 'Irving Caplan has been a supporter of Aspire since he was paralysed by a spinal cord injury in 2012 and we would like to congratulate him and his family on his daughter's wedding.

'One of our services is to provide adapted houses for spinal injured people to live in whilst they find suitable accessible accommodation. Irving Caplan lived in an Aspire House in London from April 2013 to March 2014 and since then has been a supporter of the charity, raising over £2,000.'
