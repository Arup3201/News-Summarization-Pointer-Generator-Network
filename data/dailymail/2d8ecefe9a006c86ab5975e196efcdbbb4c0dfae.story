A dog had emergency surgery after eating two pounds of gravel from her owners’ driveway.

Snickers the dog was taken to the vets when 12-year-old owner Ryan Jones noticed a bulge in her belly and thought she was pregnant.

But when vets looked at an X-ray they saw she had actually swallowed 140 gravel chippings.

Tasty snack: Three-year-old Snickers swallowed 140 gravel stones from her owner's driveway

Hungry? An X-Ray shows the mound of stones the dog consumed sitting in her stomach

They rushed the animal, a cross between a springer and cocker spaniel, into emergency surgery and retrieved the stones from her stomach.

The boy's father, Warren Jones, of Gorseinon, South Wales, said: 'We’ve always thought she was nuts, totally full of it, which is why we called her Snickers, after the chocolate bar.

'But we never expected her to actually swallow the stones.'

Schoolboy Ryan first noticed Snicker's bulge on August Bank Holiday and urged his father to have her checked out.

Quite the snack! Some of the two pounds of chippings the animal gobbled up from the family driveway

Concern: Warren Jones, pictured, the father of the dog's owner Ryan, 12, said Snickers's operation was quite expensive 'but had to be done'

Landscaper Mr Jones said: 'I knew she wasn’t pregnant, but we could feel there was something in her belly.

'Ryan was really worried, and we had to take her to the vets, who said he was concerned something had gone into her intestine. So she had to have an operation.

'The operation cost a fair bit of money, but we had to have it done.'

Snickers isn't alone in enjoying the taste of stones. 

Earlier this month, springer spaniel Flo ate 14 pebbles, weighing 1lb, in just one day.

The two-year-old animal fell ill after eating the stones, which were 'rattling' in her stomach

Owners Graham Ellis and Lisa Coppack rushed the dog to a vet in Abersoch, North Wales, where an x-ray revealed what the animal had been swallowing.

Flo is now recovering after an operation to remove them

The family have said that Snickers, a working dog that accompanies Mr Jones on shoots, would regularly chew chippings from the driveway of the family home.

But instead of spitting them out, she had been swallowing them.

The operation was carried out by Susanne Ackroyd and Janet Mathews of Haven Vets.

Vet Mrs Ackroyd said: 'This was a bit unusual, it was a first for me.

'You could feel the stones grinding away.

'Fortunately the operation was not too difficult because they had gone straight into the stomach. If they had migrated through the bowel it would have been much more evasive.

'Fortunately, I understand that Snickers is doing well.'
