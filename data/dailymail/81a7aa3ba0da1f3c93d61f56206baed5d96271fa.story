Wisdom: The renowned astrophysicist told more than a billion viewers worldwide to 'look up at the stars, and not down at your feet... be curious'

It had to be the most colourful and energetic lecture Stephen Hawking has ever given.

Britain's greatest living scientist launched the Paralympic opening ceremony with a Big Bang last night, beginning with a plea to more than a billion viewers across the planet, simply, to 'be curious'.

The renowned astrophysicist took centre stage during the extravaganza as he guided his audience through a 'journey of discovery of the wonder of science'.

As a giant flaming orb descended from the heavens, Prof Hawking's instantly recognisable computerised voice boomed through the arena - and offered some choice words of advice.

As one of Britain's most iconic symbols of human triumph over adversity, Prof Hawking wheeled onto the stage and implored the world to 'look up at the stars, not down at your feet'.

The 70-year-old, who has lived with debilitating motor neurone disease since the age of 22, went on to lead  the 62,000-strong audience through a 
'journey of discovery' - which organisers said was inspired by his 
seminal book A Brief History of Time.

But despite his illness leaving him 
almost completely paralysed and unable to speak, he said: 'We live in a universe governed by rational laws that we can discover and understand.

'Look up at the stars, and not down at your feet.

'Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.'

From there on, the spectacular was punctuated by the authoritative voice of Britain's greatest living scientist.

'There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions 
of the universe, and what can be more special than that there is no 
boundary,' he echoed later. 'And there should be no boundary to human endeavour.'

Prof Hawking's 
countless scientific papers, best-selling books and numerous awards have
earned him comparisons with Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton.

But Prof Hawking is as much a 
celebrity as he is a scientist, appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons, 
starring in Star Trek and providing narration for a British Telecom 
commercial that was later sampled on a Pink Floyd album.

In
the 1970s, already confined to a wheelchair, he produced a stream of 
first class research, including probably his most important contribution
to cosmology.

This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing.

By
applying quantum mechanics to black holes, he had taken the first steps
to combining quantum theory and general relativity. One describes the 
universe at the sub-atomic level, and the other at very large scales.

Bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals
of modern physics.

In the 1980s, Prof Hawking and 
Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa 
Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in 
space or time.

The concept was described in A Brief History Of Time, which sold 25 million copies worldwide.

In
recent years, Prof Hawking has examined the relationship between 
science and religion, writing a 2010 book, Grand Design, which argues 
that evoking God is not necessary to explain the origins of the 
universe. He met the Pope at a scientific event hosted by the Pontifical
Academy of Sciences in 2008.

To the sound of Rhianna's hit song 'Umbrella', the dancers - many of whom have physical disabilities - then glided apart to reveal a giant umbrella at the centre of the stage.

Then,
in true British fashion, the words of Shakespeare once again echoed 
through the stadium, as veteran showman Sir Ian McKellen trod the stage 
as Prospero from the Tempest, announcing: 'The greatest adventure is 
what lies ahead.'

The
extravaganza, directed by Bradley Hemmings and Jenny Sealey, was billed
as a voyage across 'a sea of ideas' - including Isaac Newton's 
discovery of gravity, which all Earth-bound athletes strive against.

Hemmings said: 'Our talks with Stephen Hawking began towards the end of last year.

'We
worked very closely with Professor Hawking to develop a series of 
messages which are very much integrated into the storytelling of the 
ceremony.

Motor neurone disease (MND) attacks the nervous system and leaves 
muscles damaged, causing loss of mobility and difficulties with speech, 
swallowing and breathing.

One in 50,000 people are diagnosed 
with the disease each year and sufferers usually die within five years 
of its onset.

Its cause is a mystery but some experts believe an 
individual's damaged genetic make-up might be a contributory factor.

There is currently no cure.

Stephen Hawking, who is confined to a wheelchair, is the world's 
best known sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

He is an exceptional case, having survived for more than 40 years, despite doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed.

'We have spent time with him in Cambridge and have been so incredibly gratified with him giving his time.

'Everybody
knows about Professor Hawking and his extraordinary theoretical work 
and writings about science which have made very complex ideas accessible
to all of us, but what came through in our meetings with him was the 
humanity and the humour of him. He is a fun guy.'

Co-artistic director Jenny Sealey added: 'Tonight you will be taken on the most exquisite journey of discovery inspired by the wonder of science.

'It is about the wonder of science and it is Stephen Hawking who guides us.

'Both Hawking and McKellen in their narrative talk about what we all need to remember; donâ€™t just look down at your feet, look at the stars, be curious.'

The show included 73 deaf and disabled professional performers and 68 disabled people among its 3,250 volunteers.

A
packed Olympic Stadium and millions more across the world watched as 
the 'spectacular and deeply human' ceremony unfolded before double 
amputee Afghan war veteran Joe Townsend flew in on a zip wire to light 
the flame.

Six Paralympians
and former competitors - including Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson - were 
flown into the stadium in gold wheelchairs.

Accompanying the athletics star were fellow Paralympians Robert Barrett, Kay Forshaw, Tony Griffin, Ian Rose and Marc Woods.

The ceremony heralded the start of 11
days of elite sporting action featuring athletes from across the world 
and before sell-out crowds who have made this the most successful 
Paralympic Games in history.

Earlier Prof Hawking said: 'The Paralympic Games is about transforming our perception of the world.

'We are all different. There is no such thing as a standard or run-of-the-mill human being but we share the same human spirit.

'What is important is that we have the ability to create.

'This creativity can take many forms, from physical achievement to theoretical physics.

'However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.'

The Games were being officially opened by the Queen, who said in a statement released in advance: 'It is with tremendous pride that the people of London and the United Kingdom welcome the world to the London 2012 Paralympic Games.

'The Games are returning to the country where they first began, more than 60 years ago.

'We look forward to celebrating the uplifting spirit which distinguishes the Paralympic Games from other events, drawing on Britain's unique sporting heritage.'
