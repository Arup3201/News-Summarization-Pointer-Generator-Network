Debris from the Soyuz rocket which took off from Kazakhstan on Tuesday is thought to be the bright light burning over Australian skies

The meteor which lit up Australia's night skies on Thursday is now believed to be left over 'space junk' from a Russian weather satellite launched in Kazakhstan.

Social media was abuzz with the pictures of the bright object with its long burning tail when it blazed over the skies of Victoria, NSW and Tasmania at 9.45pm on Thursday night.

The rare signing saw people deluge social media with claims of the unusual sighting - including drivers who nearly crashed their cars when they stopped on the roadside to watch it.

Astronomers now say the object more resembles 'man made' fragments, probably from the Russian weather satellite launched on Tuesday, rather than a meteor. The weather satellite is being used to track cloud cover, storm systems, temperature, humidity, and polar ice movements for the next five years.

Sydney observatory astronomer Melissa Hulbert said the timing of the last night's space phenomenon matches the timing and location of the rocket's mission.

'It looks like it was the upper-stage of a Soyuz's rocket that was launched a few days ago,' Ms Hulbert told AAP.

'Apparently the tracking and impact prediction matched, time and location, what we saw.'

She said the object seen over Australian skies would have been a piece of the rocket designed to fall away as part of the launch of the satellite.

'It's kind of like the Apollo mission,'she said.

'Parts would be dropped off at various points throughout the mission.'

The object would have had a diameter of about 3.35m and a length of about 1.5m, she said.

Traffic stopped to check out the blazing shooting object on Thursday night

Geosciences Australia is unable to officially confirm the reports but a shooting light blazing across the night skyline in Tasmania, Victoria and NSW at about 9.50pm lit up social media sites

Astronomical Society of Victoria president Ken Le Marquand said the colours reported to have been seen also indicated it was man-made.

'The images I've seen show a lot of different colours,' Mr Le Marquand told AAP.

'When you get lots of colours it usually means there's different materials in there, man-made materials,' he said.

'The fact they saw all these colours in it could indicate it's made of different materials.'

Mr Le Marquand also pointed to a Twitter post by Nobel Prize winning Australian National University Astronomer Brian Schmidt.

'So our fireball may well have been a piece of space junk,' Prof Schmidt wrote, linking to data showing the trajectory of meteor decay.

Monash astronomer Michael Brown replied that he had had the same idea. 'Space junk crossed my mind too. Travelling close to horizontal and taking a long (time) to burn up," he wrote.

On Thursday night motorists were so mesmerised by what was believed to be a meteor shooting through the sky that they were almost causing accidents as they were drawn to a complete standstill in the middle of the road.

Geosciences Australia were unable to confirm reports of a shooting light blazing across the night skyline. Various photos posted to social media sites had people guessing what the unexplained flying object was.

‘Cars were stopping in the middle of the road’ Heather ‏@I_enigma  tweeted while @Bombergrl2000 posted: ‘me too. daughter came home and told me, she narrowly missed accident, cars were stopping in middle of road.’

There are also many mock shots also doing the rounds on social media, for those who missed out on getting a photo of the possible meteor.
