Marco Reus has suffered another injury set-back after he was carried off midway through the second half during Borussia Dortmund's league clash with Paderborn.

Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc told the club's website that Reus could have suffered 'a lateral ankle ligament rupture' according to the team doctor's initial diagnosis.

'It is very difficult to process the fact that Marco Reus could again be ruled out, more difficult than dealing with the draw,' Jurgen Klopp said after Dortmund squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2.

The club said they did not expect to have a full diagnosis until at least Sunday, but Reus' latest injury will have sent warning signs over his fragility to Premier League clubs including Chelsea and Manchester City who are tracking the winger.

Germany international Reus, who also missed the World Cup with an ankle injury and suffered a minor injury earlier in November, started the game and scored Dortmund's second goal on the stroke of half-time.

He had to be taken off on a stretcher in the 67th minute after former Dortmund player Marvin Bakalorz, who was booked, slid in and clipped his right ankle in a rough challenge - which left Klopp furious.   

'There are situations where he makes sliding tackles without any control whatsoever. I used to tell him that he shouldn't do that. Marvin is a great lad, but that was just too much,' he said.

Bakalorz said: 'Klopp screamed at me and rightly so.'

Dortmund travel to Arsenal for their Champions League group game next week.

Reus is carried off on a stretcher and will be assessed on Sunday to discover the extent of his injury
