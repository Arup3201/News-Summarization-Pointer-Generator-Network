Provisional squad: Tremmel, Rangel, Bartley, Williams, Taylor, Britton, Ki, Montero, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Bony, Cornell, Amat, Fernandez, Richards, Shelvey, Carroll, Dyer, Gomis, Emnes, Barrow, Tiendalli, Fulton.

Eric Dier is also expected to be okay after a toe complaint ruled him out on Thursday, while Kyle Walker could make his Premier League comeback after coming through 75 minutes of the 1-0 defeat unscathed.
