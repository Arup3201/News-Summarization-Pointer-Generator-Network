Russian elder statesman Mikhail Gorbachev today warned of the threat of Armageddon if Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin fail to rapidly 'defrost' their icy relations.

The architect of glasnost also demanded that Moscow and the European Union end what he sees as the start of a new Cold War between east and west triggered by the Ukraine crisis.

Fearing 'terrible consequences', he warned: The catastrophic fall in the level of trust in international relations came as a result of the events which took place in the last few months.

'Judging by the recent declarations, diplomats of both sides are preparing for many long years of confrontation.

'This is extremely dangerous.

'With such emotions running so high, as we have now, we may not survive through these years. Somebody may just loose control of himself.

'We must do our best to overturn this tendency.'

The man who changed the world in the 1980s insisted: 'We must urgently defrost relations.'

Writing today in the Russian government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta, Mr Gorbachev, 83, warned that current international efforts to diffuse the Ukraine crisis were 'unequal to the danger that threatens us all.'

'I suggest that the leaders of Russia and the United States think about holding a summit on a broad agenda, without preliminary conditions.

'The same kind of summit must be prepared between Russia and the European Union.'

The man who bridged the ideological gap to forge working relationships with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher said that nuclear giants US and Russia 'carry special responsibility'.

'When they walk away from it, the world sees terrible consequences,' he said.

Mr Gorbachev - who has warned before that the mutual animosity between Mr Obama and Mr Putin should not cloud their dealings - declared: 'We shouldn't be afraid that someone will 'lose face' or someone will win a propaganda victory. That should all belong in the past. We should think about the future.'

On the bloodshed in eastern Europe, he stated: 'Both sides in the Ukrainian conflict are breaching the ceasefire.

'Both sides are guilty in using especially dangerous types of weapons and breaching human rights'.

He warned today's world leaders: 'War until the victorious end is impossible... It's time to stop.'

All sides must urgently abide by a peace deal signed in Minsk in September, which has so far lamentably failed to halt the fighting.

'There isn't any other one,' he said.

Gorbachev has been at odds with the West by backing Putin's annexation of Crimea saying it correct an historical error made in Soviet times.

It 'should be welcomed instead of imposing sanctions over it.'
