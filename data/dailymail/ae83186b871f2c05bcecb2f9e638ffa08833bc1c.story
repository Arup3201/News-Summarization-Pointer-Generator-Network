Attacked: Robyn Clegg-Gibson, 19, tried to end her relationship with Gary Davies on learning he lied about his age

A student slashed and 'sawed' his girlfriend’s neck with a kitchen knife to 'leave a mark on her' after she ended their relationship.

Gary Davies, 25, locked Robyn Clegg-Gibson, 19, in her bedroom before climbing on top of her and hacking a 7cm cut across her throat - narrowly missing her blood vessels.

Davies, who had been dating Miss Clegg-Gibson for just two months, said he wanted to 'teach her a lesson' after she ended the relationship on learning he had lied about his age.

Davies has pleaded guilty to wounding with intent and false imprisonment but denies attempted murder at Preston Crown Court.

The couple met through a friend in May 2013, started dating in July, and both took places at Lancaster University in September.

Mr Paul Cummings, prosecuting, told the court the relationship had become strained in the weeks leading up to the incident as Miss Clegg-Gibson discovered Davies was years older than he said.

On the night of the attack, the pair had argued about attending a party for fresher’s week, before the teenager said she wanted to end the relationship, he added.

When Davies refused to leave, she called the police, and he went to the kitchen to pick a knife, the court heard.

Mr Cummings said: 'He walked back into her bedroom with the knife in his pocket and she told him the police were on their way.

'He locked the bedroom door behind him and produced the knife from his pocket.

'She started to cry and asked him what he was doing. He told her to ring the police and tell them not to come to the address.

'She
 phoned them back and told them what he was telling her to say but her 
friends were outside her door and asked if she was ok.

'She screamed she was but she was terrified.'

A few minutes later, a police officer arrived outside and asked Davies to open the door.

Mr Cummings added: 'He pointed the knife towards her chest and grabbed her shoulder.

'He climbed on top of her and started to saw at her neck. She had her hand up and was trying to stop him.

Help: Miss Clegg-Gibson called police while Davies grabbed a knife from downstairs. Threatening her, he told her to call them back, and tell officers they were not needed at the address

Demanding: She told the jury he had been 'very demanding', wanting to see her every day after they met through a friend

'She was curled up in a ball on the floor bleeding and could feel the knife on her throat.'

Davies,
 who was also in his first year at university but lived in different 
student accommodation, was stopped when the police officer kicked down 
the door.

His victim suffered a 7cm cut across her neck, which the court heard had cut deep into fatty tissue but had not severed a blood vessel or caused nerve damage.

She also suffered two other 2cm cuts to her neck, a wound 3cm-long to her shoulder, and a cut to her thumb.

After his arrest, Davies told the police that he had wanted to 'teach her a lesson' and so had taken the knife from the kitchen and 'thrust it backwards and forwards' across her neck.

Mr Cummings said: 'He deliberately went to select a knife knowing the police had been contacted.

'He knew the relationship was at an end and he hadn’t been deterred by other students standing outside the room.

'He was determined that he was going to kill her and he used the knife violently and deliberately to her neck.

Campaign of abuse: Preston Crown Court (pictured) heard Robinson adopted Joseph as an 18-month-old baby. She beat him, locked him in darkness and without access to a toilet from 1988 to 1998

'He couldn’t have known the force necessary to just leave a mark to her body.'

Giving evidence at the hearing today Robyn said Davies had been a 'very demanding' boyfriend and had wanted to see her everyday.

She said: 'I would have preferred more time and space to myself but he insisted he see me everyday.

'When I found out he had lied about his age I couldn’t understand it.

'It’s a big thing to lie about who you are and I was scared.

'I told him I wanted to put a break on things and he seemed very tense. I’d never seen him like that before.

'He didn’t act aggressive but I could feel undertones of aggression.

'That night I didn’t want to let him in but I knew if he didn’t find his keys he would try and stay over at mine.'

The trial continues.
