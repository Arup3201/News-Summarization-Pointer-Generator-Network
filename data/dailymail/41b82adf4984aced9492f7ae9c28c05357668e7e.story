Amir Khan's training camp in California has been intensifying as the date of his fight with Devon Alexander approaches, but the British boxer found the time to relax with a massage.

Khan, 27, posted a picture on Twitter with the caption 'Massage time. Thanks @kolohe_kalei feel real good after the work u did. Sore though.'

Khan, who recently became a father, has his bout with Alexander on December 13 in Las Vegas.

If Khan's efforts pay off and he emerges victorious from his battle with Alexander, he will eye a big-name showdown with either Manny Pacquiao or Floyd Mayweather.

'Beating Alexander would do more to put me back in the mix with Floyd and Manny and I always want to fight the best,' Khan said.

'Who knows? Maybe I can have Mayweather and Pacquiao in 2015.'
