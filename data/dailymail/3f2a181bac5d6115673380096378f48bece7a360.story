Italian giants Inter Milan could be about to make a big change to their traditional shirt design after a picture of what is rumoured to be next season’s kit was released online.

The picture suggests Inter are ready to turn their back on their usual black and blue striped shirt design in a favour of hoops in time for the 2015-2016 time.

It’s a similar move to that of Barcelona, who announced they would be wearing hooped shirts from the start of next season, for the first time in their 115-year history.

Both clubs have Nike as manufacturers, but it is not known whether the leisure giant is behind either decision.

Barcelona fans were left furious by the news when it broke late last year and it remains to be seen whether Inter fans will react the same way should the change be confirmed by the club.

An away shirt was also leaked which shows a predominantly white away short with dark blue panels along the shoulders and chest of the shirt.

A predominately white away shirt with royal blue panels is set to be released for next season
