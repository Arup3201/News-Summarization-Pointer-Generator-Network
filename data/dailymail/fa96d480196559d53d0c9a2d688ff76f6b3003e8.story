If you've been in a single slump for too long, perhaps it could be time for a scenic change? 

According to a new survey from dating site Elite Singles, it seems some Australian cities score higher on the sexy scale than others.

Asking over 28,000 singletons between the ages of 30-55 to rate their level of attractiveness on a national scale, results revealed some cities had less qualms rating themselves than others when it came to a hot list.

Nominating themselves the sexiest singles on the scene was Sydney ranking in at number one,  Melbourne at number two and third sexiest was Queensland's Gold Coast.

While the sunnier cities seemed to rate higher, with Brisbane, Perth, Sunshine Coast, Newcastle, and Coffs Harbour all making the top ten, smaller populated capitals like Adelaide and Canberra also made the cut, scoring seven and eight respectively.

The study also narrowed results to indicate key suburbs that were voted most in each city, making it even easier for singles to source Australia's most attractive unattached by region.

In Sydney, Balmain in the city's inner west comes in at number one, Lane Cove in the lower north shore second and northern beach  suburb Manly takes third place.

In Melbourne, the inner South reigned supreme with Toorak (five kilometres South-East of the CBD) coming in at the top, South Bank (one km South from the CBD) scoring second and Port Melbourne (five kilometres South-West of the CBD) coming in third most attractive.

Queenslander's however have a wealth of suburbs to choose from, according to the results.

The Gold Coast hosts the hottest in Surfers Paradise, Broadbeach and Burleigh Heads. Whereas Brisbane CBD's finest were said to be in Paddington, New Farm and Hamilton. 

Lastly, for Perth locals, the top talent was found to be in Scarborough, Como and Canningvale.

Less populated cities like Darwin favoured a more modest rating and as a result ranked significantly lower on the list, coming in as the 87th most attractive singles city in Australia, while Hobart missed out on a listing completely.

Down-to-earth Darwin:  The Northern Territory capital scores low at 87th most attractive city due to their modesty 

As reported in the Northern Territory News, Darwinian's believe the reason for their low ranking isn't based on their attractive pool but  the fact  they have a more down-to-earth nature than  rival states.

'Sydney people put much more effort in every day - they put make-up on  to go to the corner store, [whereas] Darwin blokes are  rugged which is much better than guys who shave everywhere and spend hours getting ready,' said local Aleisha Boyd, 21.

As a self assessed 'attractivity' survey, the overall results do indicate while Sydney leads the way in confidence, the verdict is still out for which state actually holds the most genetically blessed singles.
