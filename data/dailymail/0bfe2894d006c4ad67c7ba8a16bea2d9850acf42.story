Close: Robert Peston, BBC Business Editor, is known to associate with senior News International man Will Lewis

At the height of the 2008 economic crisis Robert Peston became known as the man who moved markets.

A new crisis, and again it seems to be Mr Peston, the BBC's business editor, who is making the running with another series of scoops, this time broadcasting or blogging a relentless succession of dramatic developments in the News of the World phone-hacking scandal.

And once again, questions are emerging over quite who is providing the enthusiastic journalist with the 'inside track' that has placed him at the vanguard of the story.

Media commentators have highlighted the close personal and formerly professional relationship between Mr Peston and Will Lewis, the very senior News International troubleshooter, amid suggestions that the BBC man is being used by the Murdoch machine.

There are certainly links between Mr Peston, the son of Labour peer and economist Maurice Peston, and Mr Lewis.

They are friends and neighbours living in North London and were former colleagues at the Financial Times.

Mr Peston is also close to Simon Greenberg, News International's director of corporate affairs.

A gossip column last week reported that Mr Peston was among the guests at a lavish garden party thrown by PR man Matthew Freud and his wife Elisabeth Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's daughter, at their Oxfordshire mansion at the beginning of July.

According to the report Mr Peston, resplendent in a peach cotton scarf, was huddled together with Rebekah Brooks, his friend Mr Lewis, and their boss James Murdoch for a good part of the evening.

Mr Lewis, former Daily Telegraph editor, was appointed group general manager at News International last summer and has been keen to portray himself as the new broom sweeping a clean path through the scandal-hit media empire.

Certainly, all the leaks have pointedly focused on the Murdoch regime of the past, particularly on former News of the World editor Andy Coulson who left the company some time ago.

Equally usefully, the leaks have also sought to try to distance Mrs Brooks and James Murdoch – Mr Lewis's bosses – from the relentless tide of damning revelations.

Who is feeding Mr Peston with a steady flow of exclusives remains to be seen and no one ever got to the bottom of the source of that 2008 exclusive.

Back then, one of his morning radio reports for Radio 4's Today programme, breaking news of a private meeting between then Chancellor Alistair Darling and bank bosses, helped spark a tumultuous fall in UK bank shares.

The BBC's exuberant business editor had already become known as the 'face of the credit crunch', claiming a string of exclusive stories, including news that Northern Rock was seeking emergency aid from the Bank of England – which was followed by the first run on a British bank in 140 years.

Last night, Labour MP Tom Watson said it was 'not right' that Mr Peston appeared to be being 'spoonfed' internal News International documents that were being handed over to police.
