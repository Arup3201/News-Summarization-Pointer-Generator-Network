David Cameron came under attack yesterday over his promise to protect funding for schools after it emerged his plans would see spending per pupil fall in real terms.

In a major speech on education billed as an ‘all-out war on mediocrity’, the Prime Minister said every child should be able to attend a good school regardless of their postcode.

But his pledge that the amount of funding per pupil would be ring-fenced in the next Parliament started to unravel as he admitted spending would not increase in line with inflation.

The Prime Minister said the amount of money per child in English schools would be protected in cash terms

Instead, the amount schools receive per pupil would be frozen at the current level and the schools budget would only see a small rise because of increasing numbers of schoolchildren.

By the end of the next Parliament, this would mean a cut in real terms of around 7 per cent to the schools budget for children aged between five and 16, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said Mr Cameron’s pledge represented ‘quite a watering down’ of the current arrangements, and ‘real-term falls over the next Parliament’.

Speaking at a school in Enfield, North London, yesterday, Mr Cameron made his pledge not to cut the funding per child because good schools ‘need money’, adding: ‘A good education shouldn’t be a luxury – the preserve of those living within a certain postcode or those who can afford it. It should be something everyone in this country can get.’ 

Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'The cat is out of the bag. The government will ensure real terms spending cuts for our schools'

But admitting afterwards that the amount of cash per pupil – around £4,200 a year for primary pupils, and £5,300 for those at secondary school – would be frozen, he said: ‘I think that schools have demonstrated brilliantly over the last five years that they can be more efficient, they can be more effective, they can make their budgets work better.’

The Lib Dems today released the 'Gove Files' detailing what they claim were plans to cut money for schools when the coalition was formed. 

In a 13-page dossier attacking Michael Gove, Lib Dems set out a point by point assessment of the Conservative's time in government before he was appointed Chief Whip.

Tensions between Mr Gove and his Lib Dem colleagues erupted publicly on a number of occasions during his four years at the Department for Education, with Prime Minister David Cameron once forced to intervene in an ugly spat over funding.

The document says Lib Dems have spent much of the Parliament engaged in a 'battle' with Mr Gove to damp down his 'ideological' reforms.

They claim the Conservatives have 'scorched earth plans' that could mean funding for nurseries, schools and colleges is cut by a quarter within five years.

Education Minister David Laws insisted Lib Dems stopped the Tories from reducing the schools budget in 2010.

He said: 'The Conservative assumption in 2010 was for a cash freeze in the schools budget - a whopping 10% cut in real terms over the course of the Parliament.' 

A source close to Mr Gove said: 'This document is as honest as Clegg's policy on tuition fees. There's nothing else to say about such a ludicrous document.' 

The Conservatives’ decision not to cut funding for schools in the next Parliament, just after they promised an extra £2billion a year for the NHS, will also raise concerns about which departments will face cuts, with fears that defence could be affected.

Labour is expected to announce that it would increase schools funding in real terms if it wins office by cutting the deficit more slowly. However, it refused to spell out its plans yesterday.

The party’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt said the Conservatives’ claims to protect the schools budget were ‘unravelling’, adding: ‘You can’t protect schools when you have plans to take spending as a share of GDP back to levels not seen since the 1930s.’

The Liberal Democrats say the Tory plan would mean funding for nurseries, sixth form colleges and the pupil premium – which funnels funds for disadvantaged children – may be slashed by £3billion by 2020.

Lib Dem schools spokesman David Laws said yesterday: ‘This is an unbelievably weak commitment from David Cameron.

‘The Conservatives have failed even to protect the schools budget in real terms, and it is clear that they will have to make deep cuts to early years and 16 to 19 education. 

This makes a mockery of the Conservatives’ claims to want to raise standards. You simply can’t improve education while starving schools, nurseries and colleges of the resources they need.’

The funding row comes as the Conservatives announced tough new standards on literacy and numeracy in a drive to raise standards. 

Mr Cameron said the Government ‘won’t tolerate failure’ and would raise achievement in 3,500 schools rated ‘requires improvement’ by the watchdog Ofsted.

He said every secondary school in this category would be expected to become an academy.

Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, attacked the proposals as ‘ill informed’ and a decision to ‘declare war on schools’.

David Cameron at a London school yesterday when he was asked to calculate nine eights 

His party wants all children to know up to their 12 times table by the time they leave primary school. 

But David Cameron seemed wary of leading by example yesterday, when he was asked to calculate nine eights.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I do times tables only in the car with my children on the way to school and I’m going to stick to that in case I get it wrong.’

He told a journalist, who asked him the question after his speech on schools in North London, that he was employing the ‘Nicky Morgan defence’ – a reference to the answer given by his education secretary when she was asked on television what seven times eight is.

Mrs Morgan told the Good Morning Britain programme yesterday morning: ‘I’m not going to be answering any maths questions.’

The question is a classic minefield for politicians. 

Last summer, George Osborne refused to answer the ‘seven times eight’ question when interviewed by children on live television.

He told seven-year-old Samuel Raddings from Manchester that he made it ‘a rule in life not to answer a load of maths questions’, but he added: ‘Of course there is a lot of maths in my job.’

In 1998, Labour schools minister Stephen Byers was asked to multiply eight by seven and said ‘54’. The answer is 56.
