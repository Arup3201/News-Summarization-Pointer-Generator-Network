Two drunken friends played a game of 'paper, scissors, stone' to decide who would snatch a 55-year-old woman's handbag.

David Tawse and Sam Breakwell struck when the terrified woman was just yards from her home in Northallerton, North Yorkshire.

The traumatised victim has kept a diary since the attack, revealing how she is now scared to leave her home and panics when she sees anyone in a hooded top.

In one entry, on the day of the mugging attempt, she wrote: 'Emotional, tearful, angry, outraged and overwhelmed.' 

The court heard how the woman was walking home  when the thugs, who had been drinking, spotted her.

They had already decided to rob someone because their plan to sell DVDs to raise money had not made them as much as they wanted.

The woman held on tightly to the handbag when she heard the footsteps behind her quicken and feared she was going to be robbed.

After feeling a tug, she turned and saw Tawse in his hoody. She screamed to alert neighbours, causing him to scarper.

Tawse, 22, and Breakwell, 19, ran off to a nearby pub, but were arrested half an hour later in a park after witnesses gave police descriptions of them. 

In her impact statement, the victim said: 'I still feel the same anxiety when walking alone anywhere, which is unavoidable when walking to work.

'Before this incident, I had no anxiety about walking around the town at any time. Now, I worry, especially when walking in the dark.'

Tom Mitchell, defending Tawse, said: 'This sort of offence causes misery to people. It was dreadful.'

'In so far as they can make amends, these young men have done all they can. Having done the harm he did, he can do no more to put it right, after his frank admissions to the police and his early guilty plea.'

Andrew White, for Breakwell,  added: 'The victim will have known from an early stage that she would not need to come to court to relive this incident.'

Both defence lawyers said the attackers had shown genuine remorse, and Breakwell - who has never before been in trouble - wanted to write to the woman to apologise. 

Mr White said: 'At the time of the offence, his personal circumstances were pretty desperate. He had nowhere to live, he was sleeping rough on occasions.

'He had lost his job, had no money for food, no benefits, and he was extremely hungry. He had not eaten for several days.'

Mr Mitchell added: 'Mr Tawse had not eaten for two days. This was an attempt to get something to try to eat. That's no excuse. You cannot resort to robbery just because you are hungry.'

 Both men admitted attempted robbery and were jailed for 12 months at Teesside Crown Court (pictured)

The pair both pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted robbery at an earlier court hearing and were jailed for 12 months. 

The judge, Recorder Michael Slater, told them: 'She would be outraged if, after what she had been through, I simply allowed you your liberty.

'You hatched a plan, because of your financial situation, to target someone exactly like her to snatch their bag and take money from it.

'So it was when she came into your view that you targeted her and followed her for about 500 yards as she was on her way home.

'At some stage, she became aware of that, and frightened, she got out her house keys, but not before you Tawse, after a game of paper, scissors, had elected to be the one who snatched the bag.

'If I was simply concerned with the situation of each of you, given your previous good characters and given you are still young men and you have seen the error of your ways, I would try to do something that involved not sending you to immediate custody, but I cannot do that because I have the concerns regarding the complainant to address first and foremost.'
