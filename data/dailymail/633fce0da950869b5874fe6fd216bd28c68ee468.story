Wales will have far more players fit and fresh to start Six Nations training next week compared with first opponents England, whose leading men are involved in fierce club combat this weekend.

Warren Gatland, the Wales head coach, would have viewed the raft of team announcements for the final round of European Champions Cup pool games with a sense of satisfaction. 

Several regular starters will be out of the line of fire, which is not a luxury Stuart Lancaster has. Of the 15 likely to be picked to start for Wales at the Millennium Stadium on February 6, seven are not in action, including first-choice half-backs, Rhys Webb and Dan Biggar of the Ospreys.

Alex Cuthbert, Gethin Jenkins, Sam Warburton and Toby Faletau, meanwhile, are in Challenge Cup action, rather than the elite event.

In contrast, 13 of Lancaster’s likely XV will start Champions Cup ties with qualification at stake. Bath lock Dave Attwood has been named as a replacement, but fly-half George Ford will start. 

Only Gloucester wing Jonny May, who was rested from Thursday night’s win at Brive, will have had the benefit of a weekend of rest and recuperation.

The England coaches must hope to avoid any further injury setbacks before their training camp begins in Surrey on Monday, given they are already without Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury.
