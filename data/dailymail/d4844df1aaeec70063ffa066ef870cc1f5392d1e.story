Ray Rice called his sickening attack on his wife Janay 'one bad night' that 'just happened to be on video' as he spoke out in his first interview since being reinstated by the NFL.

The former Ravens running back told the Today show on Tuesday how a counselor 'ripped him apart' and put him back together after he punched his then-girlfriend in Atlantic City in February.

He claimed that while he and his wife have argued, he has never laid hands on her apart from that one incident. The couple do not believe Janay is a domestic violence victim. 

'You know, domestic violence is a real issue in society,' Rice told host Matt Lauer. 'We could take our one bad night, it just happened to be on video, but we are truly sorry to the people that are really going through it. You know, it's a real problem.'

Apologetic: With his wife Janay at his side, Ray Rice said in an interview that aired on Tuesday that he made a terrible 'uncharacteristic' mistake when he knocked her out with a single punch in February

Fears: As the family spoke with Matt Lauer, Rice said he worries about the day his daughter Rayven, pictured, searches for his name online and finds out that he punched her mother in the face

He also admitted to making a 'horrendous mistake' for not publicly apologizing to his wife at a May press conference. Instead, in a move that only served to stoke the controversy, it was Janay who apologized for her 'part' in the attack.

'It wasn't truly coming from us,' he said, explaining that the Baltimore Ravens told them what to say. 'I was nervous... I made a horrendous mistake not apologizing to my wife.'  

He went on: 'My wife is an angel - she can do no wrong. I take full responsibility for what I did. I'm horribly sorry for everything I've put my family through.' 

Rice, 27, said he now lives in fear that one day their daughter Rayven, who is now two, will search for him on Google and find out what happened.

'We know what's going to come up,' he said. 'That's what I'm worried about fixing.'

Rice, who is allowed to sign with any NFL team after winning his appeal last week, added that if he never played football again, he knows that his wife would be happier.

'I knew my wife before I had anything,' he said. 'We both know where we came from. And just to be honest with you, she's very independent. My wife can survive in this world without me. She could survive in this world in society without me. She could've done it on her own.' 

Shocking: Rice was suspended by the NFL for only two games following the one-punch knockout of his then-fiancée in an elevator at the New Jersey-based casino in February. CCTV captured the attack

He went on: 'If I never play football again, I'll be honest with you, I would adapt into life and I would sacrifice more so she can have a better future.' 

Janay, who appeared beside him and her parents for the interview, added: 'I know he'll support me in anything I want to do.'

Still, he is hopeful that an owner will welcome him to his team this season or next.

'I think that they would have to be willing to look deeper into who I am and realized that me and my wife had one bad night and I took full responsible for it,' he said.

'I accepted it... I took full responsibility. And the only thing I can hope for and wish for is a second chance.'

The couple also agreed that 'when the time is right', they would speak out and try to help others who have been affected by domestic abuse. 

His interview, which aired on Tuesday, came a day after his wife Janay spoke out in a lengthy interview of her own.

She revealed that she has still not seen the surveillance footage showing her husband knocking her out after a night of drinking in February.

After the incident, she initially thought she was 'done' with the running back - but her 'heart' told her to stay with him because it was not like him. 

The pair reconciled and married a month after his arrest for aggravated assault.

She also slammed the Ravens for failing to support her family in the aftermath and revealed that she only issued a public apology for her part in the incident after the team suggested it.

Initially, Rice was suspended by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for only two games.

But after security video of the altercation surfaced on TMZ in September, the Ravens released the three-time Pro Bowler, and his $35 million contract, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely.

The day after Rice was released from his contract, Janay took to her Instagram to describe the 'horrible nightmare' she found herself in.  

'I can't say he's telling the truth,' Janey Rice told NBC's Today show about NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in footage due to air in the next couple of days

Criticism over the two-day action led the NFL to toughen its penalties on domestic violence, with Mr Goodell admitting in a letter to team owners that he 'didn't get it right'. 

Rice is now eligible to sign with any NFL team after his indefinite suspension from the NFL was dropped on appeal by a U.S. District Judge on Friday.

During the appeal, Rice's lawyers and the union argued the league had overstepped its authority in modifying former running back's two-game suspension, saying he was being 'sentenced' twice.  

Ray Rice told NBC that he has not himself been in touch with any teams and that he's leaving it up to his agent. He added that he is working on staying in shape.
