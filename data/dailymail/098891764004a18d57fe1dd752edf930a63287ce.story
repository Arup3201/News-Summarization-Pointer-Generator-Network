With its elegant Georgian facades, 105-acre gardens and grand halls and ballrooms, all set against a backdrop of the wide Derbyshire countryside, Chatsworth House is a symbol of Great Britain at its greatest.

And the end of summer is bringing this slice of English architectural history bang up to date, with an exhibition of the finest contemporary sculpture showcasing the best of British art and art from around the world.

More than 20 vast sculptures will form part of the Beyond Limits exhibition, which will run for six weeks in the gardens of the iconic stately home from September 9 to October 27.

A specially commissioned work by Allen Jones will appear alongside works from British artists such as Marc Quinn, Tony Cragg and Bill Woodrow, as well as a pavilion by London Olympic Cauldron designer Thomas Heatherwick.

Other artists such as Italy's famous anti-fascist artist Mario Merz, who helped develop the Arte Povera movement, and Catalan Spanish sculptor Juame Plensa, will feature in the garden exhibition, which runs every year.

Visitors can still enjoy the rest of the house and gardens as well as drifting around the exhibits as part of a garden ticket - at no extra cost.

New perspective: David Breuer-Weil's 'Alien' appeared earlier this year in Grosvenor Gardens in central London before it moved for the exhibition at Chatsworth House

In a whirl: 'Cyclone Twist' by American sculptor Alice Aycock, whose works include installations for the New York Museum of Modern Art as well as galleries in Europe and Israel, swirls by the lake in the gardens

Proud: The Duke of Devonshire and Duchess of Devonshire, whose seat is at Chatsworth, visited the exhibition, which takes place every year at the house

Intriguing: The Duchess of Devonshire was able to get up close to the Spiral of the Galaxy exhibit, as will other visitors to the gardens - for no extra charge

Open art: The 20 sculptures on show make up Sotheby's Beyond Limit's sculpture exhibition in the grounds of the Derbyshire stately home

Take flight: Stephan Balkenhol's 'Engel' ('Angel') is one of many public works by the German artist to feature a standing, simple, cartoon-like figure

Snap: A visitor performs her own version of the pose of famous Columbian figurative artist Fernado Botero's Standing Woman

Reflections: The Lens by Uzbek-born Unus Safardiar, whose sculpture, along with others in the installation, will be on view to the public from 9 September to 21 October

Close-up: Unus Safardiar, whose work 'The Lens' is part of the exhibition, is well known for his metal sculptures set against abstract landscapes

Dance on: 'Arabesque' by London-based British pop artist Allen Jones - who famously turned down a request by Stanley Kubrick to design the set for the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange for no payment

Existential: The bronze sculpture 'Declination' (left) and and fibreglass 'Current Version' (right) by Tony Cragg were most recently on display in Taiwan

Abstract: 'Untitled' is a characteristic work of Bosco Sodi, a Mexican artist who uses scorched earth as the inspiration for many of his paintings and sculptures

Playful: French artist Niki De Saint-Phalle's 1970 work 'La Machine a Rever' is characteristic of her colourful style

Ice and stone: 'Igloo Ticino' by Mario Merz, the Milanese artist who was a key member of the Arte Povera movement in the 1960s and 1970s

Old and new: 'Ivy' by Spanish artist Manolo Valdes sits alongside the 18th-century sculptures in the Peak District gardens

Low art: Tony Cragg intends to create a sense of lightness with his bronze 'Tongue in Cheek' sculpture, with soft perforations and light colours making the metal appear less aggressive

Up close: Visitors can see works such as Jedd Novatt's 'Chaos Conception' (left) and 'Femme Assise, Mains Croisees' by Baltasar Lobo as part of a garden ticket to the stately home

Window frame: 'Pavilion' by Thomas Heatherwick, who often uses industrial building materials in his works to distort usual conceptions of structural objects

Solar shell: With works such as 'Spiral of the Galaxy', Marc Quinn explores the relationship between art, science, nature and beauty

Head over: Spanish Jaume Plesna's signature 'Marianna' head sculpture comes to Chatsworth House and takes up pride of place by the lawns

Art attack: Chatsworth House is already famous for its marble scultpures even without the exhibition of some of the most renowned contemporary works in the world

Day out: Besides the artworks, the 105-acre gardens of the park, managed by 18 gardeners, feature a maze, rockery, rose garden, cottage, kitchen gardens and beautiful flowers and trees

Al fresco: There's nothing to stop visitors from taking a cafe break while they explore the open-air exhibition
