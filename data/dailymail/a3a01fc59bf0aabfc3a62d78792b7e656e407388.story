The suicide note left by a former Senate chief of staff who killed himself after being charged with child porn posession has been revealed and makes allegations about his own history of sexual abuse.

Jesse Ryan Loskarn's body was found on Thursday in his family's Maryland home where he was ordered to stay while out on bail before his trial for the child pornography charges.

His mother typed up the note and posted it on a dedicated website in its entirety on Monday night.

Loskarn, 35, wrote of 'my deepest, darkest secret' and told how he was abused between the ages of five and nine years old.

He went on to explain that because of said abuse, he 'saw' himself in the pictures of the children being sexually abused in the pornography.

Beginning of the end: Ryan Loskarn was arrested on December 11 (pictured) and later ordered to live with his parents until his trial. He was found dead by suicide in their home on January 23

'It’s painful and humiliating to admit to myself, let alone the whole world, but I pictured myself as a child in the image or video. The more an image mirrored some element of my memories and took me back, the more I felt a connection,' he wrote in the note.

'The first time I saw child pornography was during a search for music on a peer-to-peer network. I wasn’t seeking it but I didn’t turn away when I saw it. Until that moment, the only place I’d seen these sorts of images was in my mind.'

The note, which was found by Politico, goes on to explain how he fought against his mental troubles for years and told only three people throughout his life of the abuse he allegedly suffered.

'As a child I didn’t understand what had happened at the time of the abuse.... In my mind I instigated and enjoyed the abuse – even as a five and nine year old – no matter the age difference.  Discussing what had happened would have meant shame and blame,' he wrote.

'As an adult I thought I was a tougher man because of the experience; that I was mentally stronger and less emotional than most. I told myself that I was superior to other people because I had dealt with this thing on my own.'

He went on to apologize to groups of people- from his relatives and former colleagues to the children in the videos that he watched.

'I perpetrated your abuse, and that will be a burden on my soul for the rest of my life,' he wrote.

His mother, Gay Loskarn, reportedly posted the letter online, and she including a few sentences where she did not defend his actions but placed the blame that he felt over his arrest on the publicity that came with it.

New allegations: Loskarn wrote that he was sexually abused as a child and that is what drew him to child porn

'Our society is quick to judge 
especially when the topic surrounding his death is so difficult. This 
letter written by Jesse Ryan Loskarn was found after he took his own 
life on January 23, 2014. If his words can help just one person who is 
suffering in silence it will be his greatest accomplishment,' she wrote.

Police
 discovered child pornography on Loskarn's hard drive after raiding his 
home as part of an investigation of a Canadian filmmaker.

Rising star: Loskarn had worked as the chief of staff to Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for two years (seen together in January)

Loskarn was on conditional release at 
the Sykesville home of his parents Chuck and Gay Loskarn, provided he 
wear a GPS monitoring bracelet and have no access to the internet.

The death was ruled a suicide Friday by the State Medical Examiner's Office.

'The
 cause of death was hanging and it was by suicide,' medical examiner's 
office spokesperson Bruce Goldfarb confirmed to MailOnline.

'For everyone involved, this is a sad and tragic story from beginning to end,' his former boss Senator Alexander said in a Friday morning statement.

Loskarn had served as chief of staff for the Republican senator for two years up until his arrest.

Loskarn's lawyers had successfully argued for his conditional release by saying the 35-year-old had no prior convictions or arrests and 'deep ties' to the community.

Loskarn was arrested last month and faced up to 10 years on possession charges and a minimum of five and maximum of 20 years on distribution charges.

According to a filing with the U.S. District Court earlier this month, police used a ram to enter Loskarn's home the day it was searched, and noticed that he put something on the ledge outside a window.

It turned out to a portable hard drive with videos depicting child pornography, according to the filing.

The
 filing states that, in 2010, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and 
Toronto Police Service were investigating a movie production company 
whose films feature young nude boys, and discovered the former political
 operative made several purchases from the company in 2010 and 2011.

Loskarn
 was a rising star who had spent the past decade working his way up to 
increasingly important posts in the House and then the Senate.

Republican Senator Alexander said in a news release the day of the arrest that he was 'stunned, 
surprised and disappointed' by the allegations against his newly 
departed staffer.

It’s painful and humiliating to admit to myself, let alone the whole world, but I pictured myself as a child in the image or video. The more an image mirrored some element of my memories and took me back, the more I felt a connection. This is my deepest, darkest secret. As a child I didn’t understand what had happened at the time of the abuse. I did know that I must not tell anyone, ever. Later the memories took on new and more troubling meaning when I became a teenager. They started to appear more often and made me feel increasingly apart from everyone else. In my mind I instigated and enjoyed the abuse – even as a five and nine year old – no matter the age difference.  Discussing what had happened would have meant shame and blame. In my life, I had only ever mentioned the abuse to three friends, and then fleetingly so. I never spoke to a mental health professional about this or any other matter until I was in the D.C. jail. I talked with a counselor there about my crime and the horrible hurt I had caused so many people.  I didn’t talk to him about my past. I didn’t think it mattered because I intended to kill myself as soon as possible.In some ways I feel disgusting sharing this truth with you because in my heart I still struggle to see my five-year-old self as a victim. But I’m sharing this with you because it is the truth, not an excuse. And I believe it played a role in my story.To my family, friends and Capitol Hill colleagues:  I’ve had individual conversations with each of you in my mind. I’ve pictured your face as I admitted to my failure and heard the shock and disappointment in your voice. I lay awake at night reviewing these conversations over and over again. They are among the most excruciatingly painful aspects of this terrible, terrible nightmare.And last, to the children in the images: I should have known better. I perpetuated your abuse and that will be a burden on my soul for the rest of my life.
