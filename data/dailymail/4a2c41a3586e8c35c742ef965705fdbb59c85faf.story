It is a feud which began in the 18th century, when the crew of HMS Bounty mutinied.

But after 225 years, descendants of Lieutenant William Bligh, the captain of the ship, and his rebellious first mate Fletcher Christian will finally make peace.

The dispute dates back to the mutiny on His Majesty’s Armed Vessel Bounty on April 28, 1789, when Christian and 17 crew members seized the ship, casting Bligh and 18 loyal shipmates adrift in the Pacific.

Bligh and his crew managed to sail nearly 4,000 miles to Timor in seven weeks with no charts and few provisions.

Christian and his men hid from the Royal Navy with their Tahitian ‘wives’ on Pitcairn island in the south Pacific, which their descendants still inhabit today.

Now Maurice Bligh, 71, the great-great-great-grandson of Captain Bligh, is preparing to meet Jacqui Christian, 44, a direct relative of the sailor who led the rebellion.

The pair will shake hands in January next year, and then celebrate the 225th anniversary of the settlers’ landing on Pitcairn.

Miss Christian will hand back a bible – long known as Bligh’s  Bible – which was taken from the captain’s cabin on the Bounty.

Mr Bligh, from Sittingbourne, Kent, will then return the bible as an act of friendship to the Pitcairn islanders to end the feud.

Historians have described the stand-off between the Blighs and the Christians as like ‘rival football teams’, with animosity simmering down the generations.
