From an online survey of more than 44,000 people, seven came out as the world's favourite number, followed by three and eight

Whether it’s a birthday, the address of your first house, or your age, numbers tend to hold certain significance in everyone’s lives.

From an online survey of more than 44,000 people, seven came out as the world’s most popular number, followed by three and eight.

But what is the significance of these numbers, and why are so many people drawn towards the number seven?

In China, the number 7 is considered lucky because it sounds similar to the Chinese words for 'arise' and 'life'.

It is also symbolic of togetherness and, as a result, is seen as a good omen in relationships.

The number six traditionally represents humanity, and therefore seven is seen as the centre of humanity and its connection to the creator.

Seven is also the number of the universe and combines the heavens, typically symbolised by the number three, and the body of Earth, associated with the number four.

The number appears regularly throughout cultures and history, too.

For example, there are seven ancient wonders of the world, seven days of the week, seven circles of the universe, seven deadly sins, and seven basic musical notes.

In Buddhism, seven is the number of ascent, and Buddha is said to have walked this number of steps at his birth.

While in Christianity, God is represented by the seventh ray in the centre of the six rays of creation.

As part of the study, respondents were asked to nominate their favourite number and give a reason why. 

The top five were:

Hebrew tradition states seven is the 
number of intelligence, and there are seven Great Holy Days in the Jewish year.

Elsewhere, the traditional Menorah has seven branches.

As part of the numbers poll, respondents were asked to nominate their favourite number.

In total, people chose 1,123 individual numbers from 30,025 submissions.

Almost half of the submissions were for numbers between one and 10.

Every number between 1 and 100 was chosen, as were 472 numbers of those between 1 and 1000.

The lowest whole number that received no points was 110.

London-based author Alex Bellos who conducted the study said: ‘The reason why a reverence for the number seven is a constant throughout human history can never be known, but to me the only credible reason is because of its unique numerical properties.

Fear of the number thirteen is called Triskaidekaphobia, a word coined in 1911, and superstitious sufferers associate the number with bad luck and misfortune. 

In Tarot cards, Death is the thirteenth card in a deck, while the end of the Mayan calendar's 13th Baktun, or cycle, was said to be the time of the apocalypse in 2012. 

In religion, Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ in the Bible, was the thirteenth member at the last supper. 

Friday the 13th is considered the unluckiest day of the month.

But in Italy, 13 is considered a lucky number, especially when gambling, whereas 17 is considered unlucky. 

Although it is not known why these numbers hold this significance in Italy, 17 is linked with bad luck because when written in Roman numerals XVII, it can be rearranged to spell the Roman word VIXI meaning ‘I have lived’ - found on ancient tombstones. 

'Of the numbers between 1 and 10 seven 
is the most arithmetically special.

'It is the only number that cannot be
 multiplied or divided with other numbers in the group. For example, the
 numbers from 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can be doubled and still sit within the 
group.

'The numbers 6, 8 and 10 divide by 2 and 9 divides by 3.'

In second place in Bellos' poll was the number three.

It is similarly lucky, especially in China because it sounds like the word birth.

Many eastern cultures also consider there to be three important stages to life, namely birth, marriage and death.

In Christianity, the number three represents the Trinity - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; Three gifts were bought to Jesus in his manger and there were three crosses at Calvary.

This number is often used to represent the heavens.

According to Teutonic mythology, three is the number of good fortune and fate.

The number three is also significant in Norse mythology and paganism. For example, Thor has three main weapons for use against the giants.

Elsewhere, in Slavic religion, Triglav is the three-headed god of war.

In third place in the poll was the number eight. Spiritually, the number eight is symbolic of infinity and paradise because it follows the seven days of creation.

Third place in the poll went to the number eight. Eight is symbolic of infinity and paradise because it follows the seven days of creation. In Islam, the throne of the world is supported by eight angels, each one corresponding to the eight divisions of space and constant letters in the Arabic alphabet, written in The Qur'an pictured

It is seen as lucky in Buddhism, because there were traditionally eight good luck omens, and in China it is seen as a sign of wealth and prosperity.

The number 88 is also significant in China because, when written, it resembles the characters used for joy and happiness.

In Islam, the throne of the world is supported by eight angels, each one corresponding to the eight divisions of space and the groups of constant letters in the Arabic alphabet.

Asked why he undertook the project Alex Bellos said: ‘Favourite numbers are a fascinating area of research since they reveal surprising ways that we are influenced by arithmetic.

'Once I decided to get interested in favourite numbers I have been amazed by how passionately so many people feel about them. It is the love that dare not speak its name.’

The art of numerology claims everything is broken down into single-digit numbers and claims these numbers are present throughout nature and history.

Six: If someone prefers the number six they are calm and caring, but prone to being clingy, self-righteous and vain.

Seven: The winning number in the online poll was seven. According to numerology, this claims the majority of people who took part in the study were wise and intellectual, but can also be critical and impatient.

Eight: Powerful, successful people tend to favour the number eight, which came third in the poll and is associated with Uranus, but this can make them materialistic and workaholics.

Nine: This number is said to combine the other numbers and their traits. People who prefer the number nine are prone to mood swings and self-pity.
