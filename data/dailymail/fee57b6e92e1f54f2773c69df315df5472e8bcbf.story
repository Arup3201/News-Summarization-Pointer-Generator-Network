A boy suffered multiple seizures after overdosing on liquorice sweets.

The 10-year-old boy was admitted to hospital in Bologna, Italy, after suffering a seizure.

Hours later, doctors reported he suffered another three seizures.

He also complained of a bad headache and had high blood pressure.

He appeared to be suffering from posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), a condition characterized by headache, confusion, seizures and visual loss.

A 10-year-old boy suffered four seizures which doctors found was due to his habit of eating 20 liquorice sweets a day for four months

But doctors were baffled as CT and MRI scans ruled out all the major condition that lead to PRES.

During a medical examination a week later doctors noticed that the boy’s teeth were black.

It transpired that he had been eating at least 20 liquorice sweets each day for the past four months.

This mean he was consuming of 2.88 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid, one of the active ingredients of liquorice.

That volume is well above the World Health OrganiSation’s recommended maximum of 2 mg/kg.

This excessive consumption had resulted in his development of high blood pressure, and in turn PRES.

After the boy stopped eating the sweets, his treatment was gradually reduced and his blood pressure returned to normal.

In light of the case, doctors are now calling for a recommended daily amount to be printed clearly on sweets packets as a safety measures.

Last year, MailOnline reported on the story of Keith Ballantine, 68, who was struck down with a rare nerve condition which left him unable to move after eating too many liquorice allsorts

The risk of PRES risk is particularly high for children with a low body weight, Dr Davide Tassinari and colleagues from the University of Bologna, Italy, said. 

The case was published in Pediatric Neurology.

In the past, the US' Food and Drug Administration has warned  black liquorice can lead to irregular heartbeats, and other health problems when consumed by adults in large quantities. 

The glycyrrhizin causes the kidneys to excrete potassium, and low levels of the compound can make the heart beat dangerously fast or irregularly.

Glycyrrhizin also leads to salt and water retention which can be a problem for people with heart failure or high blood pressure, it said.

Other studies have shown glycyrrhizinc can increase blood pressure or cause muscle weakness and chronic fatigue. 

Research has also suggested it can lower testosterone levels in men, affecting their mood and libido.

The news comes after MailOnline reported on the story of a grandfather who developed a rare nerve condition which left him unable to move, after eating too many liquorice allsorts.

Keith Ballantine, 68, was struck down with Guillain-Barre Syndrome after consuming too many of the sweets.

They gave him an upset stomach and doctors believe the antibodies he produced to fight the bug caused his body to react badly - and Mr Ballantine then developed the deadly nerve disease.

Within weeks, he was completely paralysed – and he only managed to relearn to walk again a year later.
