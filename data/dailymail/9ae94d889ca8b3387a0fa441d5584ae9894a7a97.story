Newly-released footage shows the series of events leading up to a teen girl being shot dead by police  early Saturday morning while leaving a party.

Dashcam video shows Boone County Sheriff's Deputy Tyler Brockman trying to stop Samantha Ramsey, 19, of Hebron, Kentucky - but it does not show him jumping on the hood or firing the shots that took her life.

The 48 minute video released to WLWT shows Brockman approaching the car and Ramsey not stopping. The shooting occurred off camera but friends hysterical reactions are clearly shown.

Ramsey was attempting to leave a field party along the Ohio River when Deputy Tyler Brockman (pictured) tried to stop her car to determine whether she was impaired

She does not stop: Ramsey's car keeps moving despite being approached by the police officer

The car is seen leaving the field where the party was held, and the officer fails to stop Ramsey from leaving.

Brockman chases after her on foot - he contends she tried to run him over - and the car ends up only 20 seconds later in a ditch.

The position of the deputy when he fired the shots is not shown, nor are the actual gun shots.

There is no audio in the video.

Off camera: The shooting was not shown in the footage - the smoke is coming from the car after it crashed into a ditch

Shell-shocked: The passenger on the left side of the screen stumbled out of the car and collapsed onto the ground in tears, the driver of the car on the right threw his arms in the air just after the shots were fired

Devastated: Another person collapses into the street on the right side of the screen and rocks back and forth uncontrollably

The crash is also off the screen, but a 
cloud of smoke soon billows up from the car and a passenger stumbles out
 and collapses onto the road.

She can be seen crying at the side of the road before another person is seen overcome with emotion.

Both throw their arms in the air multiple times, the person on the right side of the screen rocks back and forth, unable to calm down.

Ambulances and other police officers soon arrive and begin questioning the other teens that either saw the incident or were at the party.

Ramsey is already dead. An Ambulance soon leaves, presumably with her body.

Brockman suffered only a leg injury and was placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, sources told WLWT.

Final ride: Ramsey's body was taken away in this ambulance

Shot up: The four bullet holes in the windshield are clearly visible

‘She lost her life for him jumping on the hood of a young girl’s car,’ friend Gunnar Buemi told the station during a vigil.

Buemi became more enraged as the day went on.

‘That's murder!’ He shouted while frantically waving his arms as people cheered him on. ‘Justice needs to be done about this injustice. We're all sitting here lighting candles, being quiet when the government is out here shooting.

‘Any other human would have been put in jail for that. He needs to answer for what he did to that family.’

He was not alone in his outrage.

Grieving: Mother Brandi Stewart attended the candlelight vigil and said she wants answers

Outraged: Friend Gunnar Buemi shouted that Ramsey was murdered and called for the cop to be jailed

‘Just to be shot four times that's excessive,’ friend Lynsy Hall told WXIX. ‘That wasn't right. He could have killed the other three people that were in the car’

One of the girls in the car said the officer used excessive force.

‘The cop was in the wrong,’ Chelsea Pendleton told the Cincinnati Enquirer. ‘I was there. I was in the back seat. That was unnecessary force. He had no right to do that.’

‘That was dead body weight on the gas pedal after she was shot,’ she added.

A large crowd including the slain teen’s mother gathered to light candles on the side of the road. She isn’t angry, but she does want to know what happened.

Sad day: The memorial left at the scene of Ramsey's death

‘I just want to know what happened. I want answers,’ Brandi Stewart lamented to WXIX. ‘He was the last person that looked in my daughter's eyes that saw her face and I want answers.’

The gathering was large enough to close the road, and it brought back memories for one of the passengers in Ramsay’s car when all hell broke loose.

‘After the shots, I ducked down and then we're reversing back into the ditch and we couldn't get out for a second and I opened the door and dropped to my knees and started bawling my eyes out,’ Chelsea Pendleton told WLWT.

Authorities have not commented on the shooting other than to say an investigation is ongoing.Her friends and mother are trying to remember her in a better light.

It is not yet known if Ramsey had been drinking or doing drugs prior to the incident, police are awaiting toxicology results for confirmation.

‘I wouldn't have expected anything less because she was so loved, you know, she's a good person,’ Stewart added. ‘She loved people, they loved her. She was a people person.’
