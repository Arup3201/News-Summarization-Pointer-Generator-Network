In the hometown of The Greatest, it seemed only appropriate to talk about 12 rounds. Twelve rounds of golf that have changed the sport’s landscape entirely and will go down in the annals as creating a new standard for the European game.

Spread over three tournaments, what began in bright sunlight on the ancient links at Hoylake at The Open in July ended on Sunday in darkness on the modern stadium course at Valhalla in Louisville.

Rory McIlroy went into those trio of events with doubts about his ability to play the most venerable form of the game; with freaky Fridays swirling his conscience.

He ends them the complete player, having shown a mastery of every shot and emotion. The only players he will ever be compared to again are Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. While he will surely never reach the majors total of the former, or assume quite the level of dominance of the latter, he might actually have more strings to his bow than either.

For even the two guardians of the record books had weaknesses. Nicklaus was never a great chipper or bunker player while Woods never won a major coming from behind on the final day. But where is Rory’s weakness, after these 12 rounds?

At Hoylake he showed his ability to learn an alien form, for links play was never his forte; at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, a prowess to dominate an event from start to finish. And then at Valhalla came the gossamer touch and all the guts and heart a golfer can display.

McIlroy went into the stretch as a two-time major champion and ends it having doubled his haul and claimed his first WGC title. He has now pulled alongside the likes of Raymond Floyd and Ernie Els on the all-time majors list with seemingly all his best years to come.

He played those 12 rounds in a cumulative total of 48 under, never once going over par and only once — in the final round of The Open, where he shot 71 — did he fail to break 70.

It is worth printing in mind-boggling sequence, for we may never see the like again, given the stature of the tournaments they were delivered in: 66, 66, 68, 71, 69, 64, 66, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68.

The weekend we have just witnessed is right up there with any major you care to mention. It boiled down to four ball strikers performing close to the peak of their powers. We had a five-time major champion in Phil Mickelson; Henrik Stenson rewinding the clock a year and Rickie Fowler hoping to show that while the future might be Rory green, it will have a fairly prominent hue of orange.

When the back nine began, McIlroy trailed Fowler and Stenson by three strokes and Mickelson by two. He was out of sorts and looking fatigued after his wondrous stretch of form.

Hope was fading as fast as the light. They say the hardest thing is leading a tournament from start to finish but being able to shift momentum over the back nine on Sunday might come close.

After a good drive on the par five 10th, McIlroy still had 284 yards to reach the green. If truth be told, on these saturated fairways, if he had flushed it he wouldn’t have reached. But he caught it a fraction thin, causing it to roll on impact, and when the ball stopped it was just seven feet from the flag. Talk about a shot that changed everything.

After the resultant eagle he could have birdied the next two holes, then did seize an opportunity at the 13th. At the 15th he holed from 20ft to put enormous pressure on the other three.

Superior technique and belief told on the final holes. The 16th is a monstrous par four and it showed, as the two Americans flailed wildly. Mickelson ran up his first bogey in 22 holes. Fowler, who had bogeyed the 14th, was fortunate not to pay a similar price.

McIlroy? He drilled his tee shot so far it finished 17 yards further than anyone else managed on that hole. Mickelson went for the green with a wood; McIlroy had a nine iron.

He had another at the 17th from a fairway bunker and played it so beautifully it set up another birdie. Two strokes ahead with just the par five 18th to negotiate.

They drove off and then allowed McIlroy and his playing partner Bernd Wiesberger to play their teeshots. Here, McIlroy got his second piece of luck. Without the deluge that had caused a suspension and provoked the desperate race against time to finish, his ball would have plunged into a creek; instead it stayed on the bank.

Elation: McIlroy ranks as the third most successful European golfer in majors. Only Seve Ballesteros (five) and Sir Nick Faldo (six) have won more

The two Yankee gentlemen allowed McIlroy to play his second shot as well, which finished in a greenside bunker. Mickelson now had to hole an eagle pitch and came mighty close. Fowler, unable to see clearly, cruelly lipped out from short range for a birdie. He is just the third man alongside Woods and Nicklaus (those two again) to finish in the top five in all four majors in the same season — but the only one not to win one.

McIlroy came out of the sand and had two putts from 25ft to win. Normally, it would have been routine, although not when you can barely see a hand in front of you. But he pulled it off and let out a roar of elation.

At the prize presentation, Ted Bishop, the PGA of America president, dropped the lid of the massive Wanamaker Trophy — but trust Rory to stoop with all the reflexes of a slip fielder and catch it. So ended the 12 rounds of greatness. Next year the majors are at his two favourite courses — Augusta and St Andrews — while the PGA is at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin, where he was third in 2010.

Do you think there might be a bit of interest as he heads to the Masters in April, halfway to the Rory Slam and seeking to become only the sixth player to win all four majors?

Do feel free to join the ride if you’re not a golfer. All that is needed is an appreciation for someone doing something extraordinarily well. We’re in Roger Federer territory here, or Lionel Messi. And the most glorious thing of all? He has only just begun.
