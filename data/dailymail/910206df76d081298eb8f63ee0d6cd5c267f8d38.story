An Afghan woman has had her nose and lips allegedly cut off by her husband after refusing to sell her jewellery to fund his heroin addiction.

The mother-of-four - known only as Setara - was reportedly beaten and mutilated by her partner at their home in Herat, Afghanistan.

He allegedly hit her on the head with a stone, before using a knife to slice off her nose and lips.

Horrific: An Afghan mother-of-four - known only as Setara - has had her nose and lips 'cut off by her husband'

Injuries: She was allegedly beaten and brutally mutilated by her partner at their home in Herat, Afghanistan

The brutal attack highlights a recent surge in violence against women in Afghanistan.

Yesterday, Setara, 30, told CNN that her husband had become violent after she had refused to help him fund his drugs habit.

'He hit me on the head with a stone,' she said. 'Then, with the handle of his knife, he cut off my nose and my lips.

'He took my mobile phone and the ring I had on my finger, and then he escaped.'

Concern: Setara is pictured in hospital surrounded by concerned friends and family following the violent attack

Satara was taken to hospital following the attack, and is now awaiting treatment in Turkey.

Police launched a manhunt and later arrested two suspects, but it is unclear whether her husband has been detained.

Speaking to TV crews, Satara's mother Nasima said she wanted police to punish her son-in-law 'immediately'.

'The
 first thing they should do is flay him, then stone him to death, so 
that other people like him get taught a lesson,' she said.

Afghanistan's Taliban regime - notorious for its oppression of women - was ousted in 2001, but extreme violence against women is still rife.

There has been a 28 per cent rise in 
violence against women in the country in the past year, according to a 
report by United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). 

But alarmingly, the number of prosecutions against suspected male offenders has actually decreased in the same period. 

Hundreds of women are also languishing in 
jail for so-called 'moral crimes', a Human Rights Watch report revealed last year.

Many of those imprisoned were arrested for running away from abusive 
husbands or forced marriages - crimes which are often seen as 'adulterous' by authorities.

In 2010, Bibi Aisha appeared on the cover of Time magazine to lift the veil on the plight on many women in the country.

Aisha had her nose and ears hacked off by her husband as a punishment for trying to flee their arranged marriage - before being dragged to a mountainside to die.

Against the odds, the then 18-year-old managed to crawl to her
grandfather's house, before being transported to an American medical facility by her father.

She has now been fitted with a prosthetic nose and lives with a family in America.

In the past year, Afghanistan has also seen a staggering number of drug addicts in the country.

Its opium production surged to record levels this year - with the May harvest of opium 49 per cent higher than last year.

Last month alone, the country produced a staggering 6,060 tons of the drug, more than the combined output of the rest of the world, according to a U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report.

And the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan next year is likely to make matters even worse, said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, the UNODC regional representative in Kabul.
