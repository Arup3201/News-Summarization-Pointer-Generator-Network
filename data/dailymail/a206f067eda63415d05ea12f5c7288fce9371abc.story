John Inverdale’s latest on-air gaffe - inadvertently blurting out the c-word - has come at the worst possible time for his career.

The host of Radio 5 Live’s Cheltenham coverage was in conversation with jockey Lizzie Kelly and former champion John Francome.

They were chatting about Francome’s early days in racing when Inverdale said: ‘This is looking at it with rose-c***** — rose-tinted glasses from the past ... I apologise there for a slip of the tongue, but Lizzie your love of the sport just shines through.’

The blunder comes just over a fortnight before ITV are due to announce their Rugby World Cup line-up. Inverdale was in pole position to be lead presenter after a sure-footed anchoring of the RBS 6 Nations helped restore his reputation following his crass remarks at Wimbledon 2013, when he said women’s champion Marion Bartoli was ‘never going to be a looker’.

That incident caused Secretary of State Maria Miller to complain to BBC director-general Tony Hall, who wrote back saying Inverdale had been told ‘an incident of this nature must never happen again’.

Paul Downton, managing director of England Cricket, must realise his job would be untenable if Peter Moores, whom he appointed as coach, is axed after the World Cup debacle. 

Downton naively rounded on a group of cricket reporters in Wellington during his stay at the tournament to ask them to lay off the beleaguered Moores and get behind him instead. 

If any move galvanises journalists to do the opposite to what they’re told, it’s a crass move like that.

Olympic gold medal cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who is taking a year to learn how to ride well enough to complete in next year’s Foxhunter Chase Challenge Cup, will be at Cheltenham on Wednesday to gain more knowledge of racing. 

Pendleton will be a guest of her sponsors Betfair, who have PR company Pitch and racing strategist John Maxse to plot her course. 

This looks like a fanciful promotional ploy but everyone involved insists it is a serious venture. 

The proof will be seeing Pendleton in the saddle next March.

Sky pundit Sir Ian Botham was not only allowed to miss England’s World Cup loss to Bangladesh in Adelaide so he could prepare for a golf pro-am at the New Zealand Open in Queenstown. 

It has also emerged that he persuaded Sky and host broadcasters Star to let him be based in New Zealand because he loves the outdoor life over there.

Have 4,335 for the road!

Paddy Power, who specialise in causing mischief at Cheltenham, were tame by their standards on Tuesday, handing out a proposed 4,335 pints from a pop-up pub on the way to the course to recognise Tony McCoy’s career winning rides. 

McCoy’s representatives complained about the stunt, which the bookmakers are not repeating.

Meanwhile, the name of Cheltenham’s new £40million grandstand is to be decided by racecourse management and Jockey Club owners. 

But as the royal box is situated in the building, and given the make-up of the selection committee, a royal name is odds-on favourite.

West Ham, who have many racing enthusiasts in their squad, will be envious of Cardiff City and Aston Villa being Cheltenham guests of Betway - the Hammers’ new kit sponsors. 

But West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has taken the players training in Dubai this week, meaning they will miss the Festival and Betway’s notable hospitality.

The FA’s strong opposition to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar hasn’t stopped them hosting their national team over here.

The Qataris will be training at St George’s Park in May before a friendly against Northern Ireland to be played in the Midlands.

This is despite FA chairman Greg Dyke saying of the most controversial tournament in football history: ‘The best option would be to not hold it in Qatar, but we are now beyond that so November-December would seem to be the best of the bad options.’

The FA say Qatar using SGP is purely a commercial matter, aimed at making sure the facility is used as much as possible.
