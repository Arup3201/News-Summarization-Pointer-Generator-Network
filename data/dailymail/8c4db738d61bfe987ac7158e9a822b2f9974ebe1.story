Andy Murray will face Novak Djokovic in Sunday’s final of the Australian Open but will not have spent the evening quaking in his boots while watching in his hotel.

World No 1 he may be, but the 27 year-old Serb was less than convincing in the course of a curious 7-6, 3-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-0 victory over defending Melbourne champion Stan Wawrinka.

These two have brought out the best in each other before, but there was an uneven quality about a contest that took a sapping three and a half hours, and which neither man seemed keen to win at times.

Djokovic was cloyed by the tension of a semi-final that turned in the decider when the Swiss missed his chance of an early breakthrough and subsided from there. 

The reaction at the end was more one of relief.

However, he is normally a different animal in a final, and Murray will know that it could be a very different version of his old rival he will face on Sunday evening local time.

The Australian Open men's final between Djokovic and Murray will take place on Sunday in Melbourne

Djokovic, a week younger, holds a 15-8 record over Murray and has won seven times out of the last eight, the exception being the famous Wimbledon final of 2013. 

Twice he has beaten Murray in the Melbourne final, although it was the 27 year-old Scot who had the more impressive passage through the last four.

Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic will meet for the 24th time on Sunday in the Australian Open final, and it is the Serb who holds the 15-8 head-to-head advantage.

Djokovic has won all of the last four meetings between the pair, including their last clash in a slam at the US Open last year.

Sunday's meeting on Rod Laver Arena will be the fifth clash in a grand slam final between the pair with the score at 2-2. Murray was victorious at the US Open in 2012 and then Wimbledon in 2013, but the bad news for the Brit is that Djokovic has got the better of him in their two Australian Open finals to date, in 2011 and 2013.
