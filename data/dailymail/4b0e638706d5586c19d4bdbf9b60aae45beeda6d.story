Couples hoping a dream holiday will fix their broken relationship should think again. In fact, it's likely to lead to more rows, according a new survey.

Nearly a third (27 per cent) of divorced Brits said they decided to split up within weeks of returning from a tumultuous holiday.

And for one in 10 couples a 'make or break' trip will actually be what prompts their divorce, found the research, conducted by family law firm Slater & Gordon.

Many couples felt that a chance to escape the woes of the daily grind would help them fall in love again

Despite getting away from everyday pressures, 'band aid' holidays often actually caused couples to argue more, it suggested.

Six out of 10 couples who thought it might help them through a rocky patch found it didn't work, according to the survey of 2,128 married and divorced Britons.

The survey revealed that going on a summer break is often the last  attempt for  couples in crisis, with almost 40 per cent admitting they had gone on holiday in an attempt to save their marriage.

Many couples felt that a chance to escape the woes of the daily grind would help them fall in love again.

Make or break holidays: Forty per cent of Britons felt that trips away put a strain on their relationship

But in reality, the pressure of spending time alone together turned out to be the catalyst for 15 per cent of warring couples to realise they weren't in love, and the same proportion not talking to each other during the trip at all.

Forty per cent of Britons felt that holidays put a strain on their relationship and 28 per cent claimed they had split up with someone on holiday.

And nearly one in ten said they avoided their partner to relieve the tension, while eight per cent of those surveyed even ended the holiday early.

One in twenty holidaying couples even said they used the break to discuss getting a divorce.  

Not all doom and gloom: Thirty-six per cent of couples surveyed said a holiday had saved their marriage

But it was not all negative with 36 per cent saying that the holiday saved their marriage. 

Amanda McAlister, head of family law at Slater & Gordon, said: 'One of the fundamental issues is that a holiday environment is essentially an artificial one and the problems that couples have will still be there when they return home.

'It takes more than a week in the sun to fix deep rooted problems but by taking the holiday and doing everything you can to save a marriage it means that even if a couple does decide to divorce it can often been done more amicably and without a lengthy court battle.

'This is because neither party will feel like the other hasn't tried to fix the problems and both parties will normally have come to a mutual decision on the end of the marriage.'
