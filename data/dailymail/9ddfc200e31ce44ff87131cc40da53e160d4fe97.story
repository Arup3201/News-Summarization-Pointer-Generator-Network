A boy of five who had to have 13 milk teeth removed after suffering severe toothache is to receive a £9,000 payout from his dentist.

Cameron Jackson had the decayed teeth – including his entire top row – taken out when he was three, leaving him only seven teeth until his adult set grows.

His mother took legal action against his dentist, who failed to spot the decay after Cameron’s toothache grew worse.

Cameron Jackson, pictured with his mum Wendy, had to have 13 teeth removed after suffering toothache at the age of three

They have now reached an out-of-court settlement and Cameron will receive the money when he is 18.

Dr Raymond Matloa, the dentist at the 
Fountain Street Medical Practice in Morley, Leeds, has not admitted 
liability for the loss of the boy’s teeth.

It is not known why Cameron’s teeth deteriorated, but his mother, Wendy Jackson, insists he was not eating any sweets.

‘I first realised something was wrong 
when Cameron was unable to eat solid food at about 18 months,’ she said.
‘He didn’t eat solid food at all and wouldn’t even touch sweets. He 
just drank milk.’

Removed: Cameron was just three years old when he had 13 of his milk teeth taken out, leaving him with seven for the next few years

Mrs Jackson, from Bradford, West 
Yorkshire, said she grew increasingly concerned. ‘His dentist kept 
saying his teeth were fine but even I could see they were yellow, not 
white like milk teeth should be,’ she said.

‘The dentist advised us to brush them 
more but when we did his teeth literally crumbled and ended up looking 
like little pegs. Cameron would scream and his gums would bleed like 
crazy. He woke up every night crying.’

Mrs Jackson, 31, whose two other 
children, aged ten and two, have normal teeth with no fillings, gave 
Cameron pain relief every evening.

‘The dentist said he was eating too 
many sweets, which I knew wasn’t right because Cameron never touched any
solid food, never mind sweets,’ she said.

Settlement: Cameron will receive the £9,000 when he reaches his 18th birthday, by which time he will also have all of his teeth back

She took Cameron to her GP but was 
told he was fine, she said. In December 2010, Dr Matloa referred him to 
Leeds General Infirmary.

‘At first they said I must have taken 
something when I was pregnant to cause the decay,’ said Mrs Jackson, who
told the doctors she had not been on any prescription drugs.

Cameron’s teeth were removed at a dental institute in Leeds in 2010.

Mrs Jackson said he was now very self-conscious.

Careful: His mother Wendy says she had always taken him for check-ups and brushed his teeth but his toothache became worse

She said: ‘He doesn’t like smiling because he’s scared that somebody’s going to say, “Why have you got no teeth?”

‘The payout doesn’t give me the 
answers I want and doesn’t change what’s happened, but it’s good that 
Cameron can have that money when he’s older,’ she said.

The family’s lawyer, Heather Williams,
of the Dental Law Partnership, said coping with fewer teeth until his 
adult teeth grew was ‘something that no one would like to go through, 
especially at his age’.

Dr Matloa declined to comment.
