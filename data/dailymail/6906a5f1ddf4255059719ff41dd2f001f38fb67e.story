Drivers had to take a second look when they spotted a goat travelling in the back seat of a car on a busy A-road.

The high-speed animal was spotted in the back seat of a red Volkswagen Golf on the busy A55 outside Chester.

The goat, which might have been more at home in a farmyard, was clearly visible in the back of the vehicle in the evening sunshine.

The goat is seen in the back of the red Volkswagen Golf, which was travelling along the A55 towards Chester

It seemed calm while its driver travelled at 60mph - sitting quite still in the back seat and staring out of the window.

The unusual sighting was captured by Chris Cousens, 29, from Hoole, Chester, at about 7pm on Wednesday.

‘You are used to seeing dogs in the back of cars but I’ve never seen a goat before,’ he said.

‘I had to look twice just to make sure my eyes weren’t playing tricks on me.’

The car turned off towards Chester city centre but its destination remains a mystery.

A Cheshire Police spokesman said the force was not aware of any reports relating to the incident but would advice drivers to take care when driving with animals in their cars.

He said: 'While it is not technically illegal to have a goat in the back of your car, you need to ensure that it is not going to be a distraction to you whilst you are driving. 

'Any animal which causes you to lose control or drive erratically can lead to you being charged with a road traffic offence.

'It doesn’t matter whether it is a cat, dog, goat or lama.'

The car was travelling along the A55 towards Chester city centre when it was spotted by Chris Cousens
