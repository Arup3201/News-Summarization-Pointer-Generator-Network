Newcastle have unveiled their new black-and-white home kit ahead of their season opener against Manchester City at St James' Park.

The Puma-designed strip, which fans can get their hands on from August 14, incorporates the club's famous black-and-white stripes and a black chest panel.

Summer signings including Remy Cabella, Jack Colback and Emmanuel Riviere will wear the kit at the Magpies' open day at St James' on August 12.

Supporters will get the chance to see their heroes sport the new strip for the first time that day, less than a week before Alan Pardew's men host Yaya Toure and Co in their first game of the 2014/15 campaign.

But some fans are unhappy with Puma's effort, singling out the large black section on the chest for criticism on Twitter.

TrueGeordieNUFC wrote: 'Looks a bit incomplete without a cape to match the super hero chest piece', while stephclark6 tweeted 'how can black and white stripes be ruined? Ask @NUFC cos they've managed it!'

After the first image of the new kit was revealed on the social media site, JJFletcher7 tweeted: 'Well there we have it confirmed officially the worst kit in Newcastle United history! Well done @pumafootball'

Back-up stopper Rob Elliot models the new goalkeeper top - which has a passing resemblance to a QR code for smartphones - in the club's official photos, with Tim Krul having been given an extended break after Holland's World Cup exploits. 

One player who looks unlikely to pull on the club's colours again is winger Hatem Ben Arfa.

The Frenchman is currently training with the club's reserve side after Pardew criticised his professionalism.

He could be sent on loan to Lyon as part of a permanent deal for the League 1 side's highly-rated striker Alexandre Lacazette.
