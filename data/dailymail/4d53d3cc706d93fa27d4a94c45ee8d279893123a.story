A drug squad uncovered an underground cannabis cave when they raided a remote ten acre farm run by a retired company director.

Trevor Winterbottom, 68, had been secretly growing the drug at his luxury £500,000 suburban home.

But when his crop grew so large he ran out of room and dug a giant hole underneath an outbuilding at an isolated farm he owned three miles away to house his plants.

Quite a crop: Trevor Winterbottom cultivated cannabis in an underground home-made basement hidden within his 10 acre property

The ceiling was held up with crude building supports and officers discovered 200 mature plants being grown

Police found the underground farm during Britain’s big freeze last January after being tipped off.

They spotted a trail of footprints in the snow leading to the outbuilding, to find the basement had been excavated beneath the building and was only accessible by a homemade hatch using of ladders that were nailed to hardboard.

The ceiling was held up with building supports and officers discovered 200 mature plants being grown. Electricity that was being used to power lights above the plants was being abstracted from elsewhere.

A number of other cannabis plants were also recovered from inside the address. The recovered cannabis plants had a combined street value of £145,000.

Winterbottom snr, who used to run a property company, and his businessman son, Trevor jnr, 31, were both caught in one of the outbuildings in Hyde, Greater Manchester.

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Winterbottom snr of Stalybridge, admitted producing cannabis and also admitted abstracting electricity.

He was jailed for 45 months at Manchester Crown Court.

Winterbottom jnr was given a community order for 12 months and ordered to do 240 hours unpaid work after admitting producing cannabis.

Greater Manchester Police said that at about 12.50pm on Wednesday 23 January officers attended the address - a farm off Harrop Edge Road, Hyde, owned by Winterbottom snr - following a report of suspicious activity at the location.

The property is situated at the top of a single track road and stands on a 10 acre plot that contains the main home, a static caravan, three metal shipping containers, two brick buildings and a large wooden structure.

The land was covered in snow when officers arrived and having identified footprints in the snow a search of the outbuildings commenced.

A short time later the two defendants were arrested in the wooden outbuilding.

Det Con Marc Barker, said: 'By his own admission Trevor senior admitted digging up his land and creating a makeshift cellar when the crop he had been growing in his house became too big.

'A crude yet fully functioning structure complete with a sophisticated lightening system was built beneath one of the out buildings and was extremely well hidden.

'Their sole intention was to cultivate a large amount of cannabis and had we not acted when we did their crop would have seen them make a considerable amount of cash.'
