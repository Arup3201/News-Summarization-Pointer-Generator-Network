'Threat' Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, urged the government to give doctors more cash

Doctors were lambasted last night for complaining that the GP service was under ‘threat of extinction’ at the same time as demanding a pay rise.

The Royal College of General Practitioners said some surgeries could be forced to close because of a ‘toxic mix’ of increasing workloads and smaller budgets.

And the British Medical Association said the Government’s offer of another below-inflation pay rise had left doctors with a ‘deep sense of outrage’, and a poll of GPs found that more than half were considering early retirement.

Last night, angry MPs said the traditional family doctor service would not be at risk if GPs were not paid so much.

Ten years ago, doctors took advantage of a botched contract to increase their pay by a third. The vast majority also opted out of responsibility for their patients out of hours - during evenings, bank holidays and at weekends.

Pay has fallen slightly over the past few years thanks to a series of public sector pay freezes, but GPs still earn an average of £105,000 a year, despite working fewer hours than previously. Hospital consultants have also benefited from generous pay increases.

Yesterday Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the RCGP, said the critical state of general practice was affecting patient care. She urged the Government to set aside more funding.

‘General practice as we know it is now under severe threat of extinction,’ she said. ‘It is imploding faster than people realise and patients are already bearing the brunt of the problem.

‘This will only get worse unless urgent action is taken to redress the huge and historic imbalance in funding. We can no longer guarantee a future for general practice as our patients know it.

‘We are being seriously crippled by a toxic mix of increasing workloads and ever dwindling budgets.’

A survey commissioned by the body found that a third of people were unable to get an appointment for themselves or a family member in the same week the last time they tried.

Dr Baker’s intervention came a day after Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA council, wrote to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the latest pay deal, under which NHS staff would receive a 1 per cent pay rise only if they were not eligible for incremental pay rises.

Hospital doctors receive this so-called ‘progression pay’, which is designed to reward the gaining of skills and experience. GPs receive something similar, called seniority pay.

Dr Porter told Mr Hunt: ‘Your deliberate conflation of pay progression and cost-of-living uplift is particularly misplaced. Leaving aside the fact that a 1 per cent uplift would in no way keep pace with the increases in the cost of living, incremental pay progression is... required to recognise learning and development in a role.’

Last night Andrew Percy, a Tory MP on the Commons health select committee, said: ‘It’s an odd argument for doctors to on the one hand be complaining about pressure on NHS budgets, while on the other hand be demanding NHS money be taken from patients to enhance their already generous salaries.’

Priti Patel, a Tory MP and member of the No 10 policy board, added: ‘The priority of GPs should be putting the patient first and delivering high-quality local healthcare provision.

‘Family doctors provide a very, very important public service and they are rewarded accordingly but the truth is they need to adapt. Most people work, so they want to see a GP at the weekend, for example.’

A BMA survey of 420 family doctors found that 57 per cent were considering early retirement because of heavy workloads.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘We have cut GPs’ targets by more than a third to free up more time with patients and are dramatically increasing trainees so that GP numbers continue to grow faster than the population.’
