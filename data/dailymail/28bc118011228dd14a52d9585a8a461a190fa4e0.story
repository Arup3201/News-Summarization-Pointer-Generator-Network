George North's stunning four-try blitz catapulted Northampton to a bonus-point win at Franklin’s Gardens last night, but Luther Burrell gave England another injury scare as he went off with damage to his left hand.

The Saints ignited their Champions Cup campaign courtesy of North’s heroics and in the process became the first team to beat the Ospreys this season. 

While their Welsh wing provided the deadly finishing, the hosts were also well served by their England contingent, especially flankers Calum Clark and Tom Wood, and lock Courtney Lawes, while fly-half Stephen Myler ran the show with calm authority.

With the national squad going into camp this evening, head coach Stuart Lancaster will anxiously await updates on Burrell, who was withdrawn just after half-time and was due to go for an X-ray. 

England already have a long casualty list and they could do without losing another centre, after learning that Manu Tuilagi will miss the whole QBE series of four Tests.

Jim Mallinder, Northampton’s director of rugby, said: ‘Luther has banged his hand, it’s very sore and he’s struggling to grip. Fingers crossed there’s no permanent damage.’

Saints were seeking to bounce back from their defeat against Racing Metro in Paris a week earlier and this was the emphatic result they craved.

Myler’s goal-kicking was immaculate and yielded 14 points, but North — who had begun the season with a hat-trick against Gloucester — dominated the scoreboard again. 

His first try stemmed from a turn-over and Myler’s long, floated pass which presented a simple run on the outside to the line. Next, North supported Ken Pisi’s weaving break down the right and took the inside off-load which put him in the clear.

After the break, the 22-year-old smashed over from close range and, three minutes from time, he stole the ball out wide for a superb solo effort — kicking ahead and winning the race to touch down.

‘It’s the first time I’ve scored four tries in a game, so I’m very happy with my performance,’ said North. 

‘That performance was definitely up there for me personally, but it was a whole team effort — we knew we needed a big performance and that’s what we produced.’
