An incredible picture captures the moment a rocket leaves the Earth's gravity whilst a skydiver succumbs to the planets forces.

It happened more than six years ago when a Delta II rocket blasted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, California.

Whilst the rocket was zooming off towards space carrying a satellite, Staff Sgt. Eric Thompson was plummeting towards Earth and managed to snap the photo.

The picture captures the silhouette of a falling instructor and pupil along with the rocket blasting off into space behind them.

Staff Sgt. Thompson was the instructor with the 532nd Training Squadron based out of Vandenberg.

He knew the rocket launch was going to take place on 7th June 2007 and planned his skydive in order to capture the moment from a unique perspective.

The photo is shown on the Vandenberg website titled 'One goes up, one comes down'.

Both the launch and the dive were successful.
