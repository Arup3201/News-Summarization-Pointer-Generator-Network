Even if you're the CIA director, no sex scandal is complete without a ribbing from the jokesters of late night television.

Gen David Petraeus, who shocked the nation when he admitted he had carried on an extramarital affair with biographer Paula Broadwell and resigned on Friday, joined the ranks of other federal officials and celebrities who have succumbed to indiscretion: he became a target for laughs.

After speaking about spy thriller Skyfall, Jimmy Kimmel quickly changed the subject to Petraeus, a man who 'has been doing his best James Bond imitation lately.'

Quips: Jay Leno urged his audience to hug someone who had served in the U.S. Armed Forces - 'unless your name is Paula Broadwell'

Saying that the scandal is better than the Showtime hit Homeland, Kimmel proposed a TV special called 'CIA Smackdown' with the notorious Jerry Springer as host - complete with confessions, revelations, and girl fights.

After asking current and former military members in the audience to stand for a brief Veterans Day tribute, Jay Leno said he hoped his viewers had hugged a veteran.

'... Unless your name is Paula Broadwell,' Leno quipped.

There was much anticipation over what Jon Stewart would say on The Daily Show, as he had interviewed Broadwell earlier this year while she was promoting the biography All In: The Education of General David Petraeus.

It's 'All In' the title: Stewart suggested an alternate name for the biography that Broadwell wrote

'I'm the worst journalist in the world!’ proclaimed Stewart, who admitted that he should have picked up on 'innuendo after innuendo' she fed him during the show.

Stewart joked that he was too distracted by her toned arms to notice. Broadwell had challenged him and her husband Scott to a push-up contest during the January interview, and the men lost.

He also invoked the obvious title of the book and recommends that she should have instead called it 'What has two thumbs and is banging his biographer?'

Admission: Stephen Colbert, who has written two books himself, jokingly confessed to his 'Colbert Nation' that he has had sexual relations with the writer, himself

Fellow Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert, who has written two books himself, jokingly confessed to his 'Colbert Nation': It's time for me to come clean.

'I had an improper relationship with my biographer. I've spent a lot of time alone with the author of these books. There was a connection and let’s just say, he got a little handsy. And I did things I never thought I would do, but have been doing for decades. I’m sorry.'

In the same vein, CBS funnyman David Letterman said: '[Petraeus] allegedly had an affair with his biographer, which means from now on, he'll only be having sex with his AUTO-biographer.'
