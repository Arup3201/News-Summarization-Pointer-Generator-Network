Thomas Cook plans to axe up to 2,500 jobs – one in six of its workforce.

The troubled holiday firm is to close 195 stores in Britain as part of a three-year plan to transform its fortunes.

The 172-year-old company said jobs at its head offices at Peterborough and Preston were also at risk, and that it would close its Accrington office.

Job losses: 2,500 workers are to be axed at holidays group Thomas Cook after it revealed plans to close 195 of its high street travel agencies

Thomas Cook also has offices in Egham in Surrey, Brighton, and Birkenshaw in West Yorkshire.

It has already closed 168 stores and shed 1,100 workers in recent years as customers have tightened their belts and spent less on foreign holidays.

It has also battled the euro crisis, high fuel costs and unrest in key destinations such as Egypt and Greece.

A spokesman for Thomas Cook insisted it would maintain a ‘strong presence on the high street’.

He added that the stores earmarked for closure did not meet performance targets or were in areas where the group has more than one retail outlet.

The company slumped to a £590million loss in its last financial year and wants to slash costs.

Changes: Bosses say that jobs and shops must go to make the business more profitable

Having been forced to turn to its banks for an additional £200million of loans in 2011, the UK’s second-biggest travel company has already trimmed its airline fleet and sold off hotels.

Many of the stores being closed in the latest cutbacks are Co-operative Travel stores.

Thomas Cook and the Co-op merged their high street businesses in 2011. UK chief executive Peter Fankhauser said yesterday: ‘We firmly believe these proposals will mean a better, more profitable Thomas Cook that continues to be a major employer in the UK.’

He added that Thomas Cook was planning to open its travel agencies on bank holidays and Sundays, while also potentially extending opening hours during the week in an effort to meet customer demand.

Stores will likewise be better staffed in peak trading times, such as lunch hours.

But he confirmed this will mean changes in working patterns for many of its retail staff.

Group chief executive Harriet Green, who took over last May, has been busy trying to transform the group.

She has boosted the firm’s finances following a series of disposals to slash its £1.5billion debt mountain, including the sale of its Indian business and several Spanish hotels.

Oliver Richardson, of the union Unite, said the job cuts were ‘a devastating blow for Thomas Cook staff across the retail network’.

He added: ‘It is yet another dark day for Britain’s high streets.’

The Transport Salaried Staffs 
Association, which represents employees, said it was 'shocked and angry'
at the scale of the job losses.

General
secretary Manuel Cortes said: 'This constant policy of slash and burn, 
with the axing of one in four stores and the loss of jobs, is simply 
self-defeating.

'The company needs new products if it to come to come to terms with the age of the internet and prosper in the 21st century.

'That
is the only way to stop this spiral of decline which repeated bad 
management decisions over the past five years has led them.'

Earlier this week Thomas Cook said it had decided not to sell its under-performing French business and would instead kick off a restructuring programme to turn the unit around.

Thomas Cook last month reported reduced first-quarter operating losses and said its turnaround plan was on track.

Shares in Thomas Cook, which have risen 78 percent so far this year, were 0.3 percent up at 85.6 pence by 1225 GMT, valuing the business at around £777million.

Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook UK and 
Ireland’s CEO, said: 'It is never easy to make decisions that impact 
directly on our people, but we also owe it to our customers to shape the
business effectively and ensure that, when they book their holiday with
us, our administrative costs are as low as possible.

'As we improve and develop our online
capabilities, maintaining a strong presence on the High Street is an 
important part of our omni-channel strategy. Even after these changes we
will still have one of the largest retail networks in UK travel.

'It is essential that we operate with
the right number of people as we move forward into the next era for our
company, allowing us to meet the future needs of our customers more 
effectively.  These proposals will mean a stronger Thomas Cook that 
continues to be a major employer in the UK dedicated to providing 
excellent holiday experiences to our 23 million customers.

'We are in consultation with our 
Unions and employee representative bodies to minimise the impact of 
these changes and I am speaking personally to all employees today to 
provide information and support through this period of consultation.'

Meanwhile more than 500 people working 
for bed company Dreams could lose their jobs because a rescue deal to 
save the bust business will not save all its stores.

Under threat: A deal to save Dreams has been set up but it means 90 stores will shut, costing 500 people their jobs

Sun European, which already owns sofa 
chain SCS Upholstery, will buy 170 high street shops and take on 1,600 
staff, with the remaining 90 showrooms set to be axed by administrators 
Ernst & Young.

There are also fears that the chain's head office in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, could be at risk under the £35 million deal.

It is another blow to the battered high street, which has recently seen the closure of all Comet and Jessops stores and a number of HMV and Blockbuster shops after a spate of high-profile administrations.

Private equity firm Exponent acquired Dreams from its founder Mike Clare in 2008 in a deal worth more than £200 million. 

It is thought that Mr Clare wanted to win back the business and keep every shop open, but was thwarted.

Mr Clare worked for several furniture firms before setting up a sofa bed shop in Uxbridge, Middlesex, in 1986.

Upset: Mike Clare, founder of Dreams, who sold the business for £200m in 2008, says he has tried to save the company

The father-of-four remortgaged his home with his wife to start the business. A year later they opened the first Dreams store after adding beds to the range.

In 2006 Dreams opened an 84,000 sq ft bed factory in Oldbury, West Midlands.

Mr Clare, has expressed his disappointment and sadness at the news that the company is to cease trading today.

'I already have plans in an advanced 
stage to rescue as many of the stores in the Dreams portfolio, and with 
it as many of the jobs within the company’s skilled workforce, as 
possible.  

'I already own the Dreams Head Office and will be announcing further plans in the next few days'.

Yesterday three-quarters of the workforce at historic carpets firm Axminster were made redundant after the company entered administration.

The Devon-based company, which dates back 250 years, blamed a sharp increase in raw material prices and the UK's continuing economic difficulties for the decision to go into administration.

Restructuring firm Duff & Phelps, which has been appointed to run the firm, said it will continue the company's search for a buyer but said it had been necessary to make around 300 staff redundant.
