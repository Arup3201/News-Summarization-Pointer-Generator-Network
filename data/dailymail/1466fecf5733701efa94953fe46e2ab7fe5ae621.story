Garry Monk has told Bafetimbi Gomis to forget any idea he has of leaving Swansea this month.

Gomis’s apparent agitations to leave the club threatened to plunge Swansea into a major striker crisis so soon after Wilfried Bony’s departure for Manchester City.

But in talks this week Monk has told the Frenchman he cannot leave until the summer at the earliest, suggesting also that a move to Crystal Palace – known admirers of the 29-year-old – would represent a ‘sideways or downwards’ step in his career.

Monk attempted to play down the issue on Thursday, but that should not disguise the strength of anger felt among senior members of the club’s hierarchy, who Sportsmail understands were furious with the comments Gomis made in a French television interview last weekend.

There is also expected to be a backlash from the club’s supporters, when Swansea face Blackburn in the FA Cup on Sunday, despite Monk’s suggestion that naivety was the root of the issue.

Monk said: ‘I had a chat with him and what I said to him I will keep between me and him. He is a good player and I can’t afford to lose any more good players.

‘Every player in the world has a possibility of moving but it doesn’t mean that possibility has to come to a reality. It is up to the club what happens and Bafe is far too important to us.

‘He has got a great chance now to make a name for himself in the Premier League and finish the season strongly. Then, if he had ambitions at that point, we could discuss them.’

Monk added: ‘What I did talk to Bafe about was how these things are perceived inside and outside the club. 

'He probably wasn’t fully aware of what those comments cause and I made him aware of that when I spoke to him.

‘He’s not stupid, but I don’t think he honestly thought it would be perceived the way it was. It’s not the type of culture you want here in Britain, but it happens a lot on the continent.’

Bony was the top scorer in the Premier League during 2014 - netting 20 goals for the Swans

Palace are keen on a £9m move for the striker, while Arsenal, Newcastle, Schalke and Borussia Dortmund are reportedly interested.

Monk said: ‘If he did have ambitions to play for other clubs it should be big clubs. 

'We have proved that with Bony and other strikers, if you do well at this club, you score goals and perform you will get the opportunity and get linked to big clubs.

‘There should be no thinking of a sideways move or a downward step which a lot of the links are coming to.’
