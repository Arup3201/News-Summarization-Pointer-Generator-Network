Sam Allardyce is ready to unleash £12million signing Enner Valencia and wants the Ecuador striker to repeat his World Cup form.

Valencia scored three times for his country in Brazil but has made just two substitute appearances for West Ham so far. He is expected to line up at Hull tonight following a goalscoring outing for his country in a 4-0 win against Bolivia.

Allardyce said: ‘He is ready to start. It will be a great boost for us once he gets out there and produces what he did at the World Cup.’

Steve Bruce has urged Hull fans not to protest against owner Assem Allam’s name-change crusade during the match, saying: ‘It can’t be fractious, that helps no one. They can have their thoughts but once it gets to match day we need them to get behind the team.’

Hull are likely to give a debut to Mohamed Diame against the club he left a fortnight ago.
