Thinking of buying underwear for the party season but daunted by the prospect of traipsing from shop to shop, spending hours being measured and trying on bras?

Ordering online and taking the time to try them on at home is far more appealing. But given that I’ve oscillated from a post-pregnancy 36HH to the 32F I was a few months ago, could I really buy a bra over the internet and actually expect it to fit? A new online brand, Optifit, claims its measuring method means its bras will fit any woman.

I put this device to the test, pitting it against other online approaches — while expert bra fitter Allison Hawkins gives me her verdict . . .

OPTIFIT

optifit.com

MEASURING PROCESS: Optifit bras are made with no underwiring, padding or gel, which supposedly put pressure on breast tissue. Uses its own sizes and measuring system, a strap called the Opti-Measure. You have to send off for this (£4 plus £1.50 postage) and it takes a couple of days to arrive. This gives you a body frame measurement (a letter from T to Z); your body depth (small, medium or large); and breast volume (from one to 21). You then order one of six bras. I chose Shades Of Grey, £69.99.

ORDERING TIME: With up to 504 sizes, sometimes the bras are made to order and delivery (£4) takes two weeks. After I’d placed my order, Optifit’s Sue McDonald called me. As I fell between two sizes, she sent me both — I could send back the spare — plus an extender for the band and an instructional DVD.

MY VERDICT: Feels unlike any other bra. The material was super-soft, but I didn’t like the 1950s ‘torpedo boobs’ look. I liked that the band sat low on my back, but though I’d been warned the bra is meant to feel tight, I found it uncomfortable.

EXPERT VERDICT: I was pleasantly surprised. But while the design was supportive, the cups seemed to flatten Lucy’s breasts and make them point in different directions, and it was far too tight under the breast bone. 7/10

BRAVISSIMO

MEASURING PROCESS: The site has a video showing the differences in look and feel between a good and bad fit. A three-step guide to finding the perfect fit specifically excludes a tape measure. Instead, it tells you what to look for when you stand in front of a mirror in your current bra.

So, if you are wearing a 34D where the back is riding up, reduce the back size to 32 — but, if the current cups fit you should also increase the cup size, to a DD because a 32D is a smaller cup than a 34D.

I was satisfied that 32F was right for me, so I chose a Freya design called Deco Honey (£32) in Jade.

ORDERING TIME: Standard delivery cost £3.95 and took three days.

MY VERDICT: Hello, boys! This plunge-cut, moulded bra made me feel quite sexy although it didn’t fit properly. It pushed my breasts up so they were spilling out, but I can’t help thinking it would be fun for a night out.

EXPERT VERDICT: Lucy likes this for the wow factor but it’s way too tight, puts too much pressure on her shoulders and will give her backache. 5/10

MARKS & SPENCER

THE MEASURING PROCESS: In the DD-plus lingerie section, I clicked the link to the Bra Fit Tool and followed a step-by-step guide to measuring yourself.

First, you put on the best-fitting bra you already own. Next, you choose between an everyday bra, a maternity bra or a sports bra — I chose the first.

Then you measure your ‘underband’ — just below where your bra sits. You enter this measurement, along with the size, brand and fit of the bra you’re wearing, then answer questions about your age and build.

I turned out to be the 32F I thought I was all along and chose the Iris Embroidered Non-Padded Full Cup (£22.50) because I thought the pale purple colour was pretty.

ORDERING TIME: Delivery cost £3.99 and the bra arrived the next day.

MY VERDICT: Despite the secure fastening and underwiring, the silky material initially felt comfortable. But after half an hour, the straps started digging in to my shoulders, and although it seemed to be the right size, I realised my breasts looked a bit saggy.

EXPERT VERDICT: Not bad for the price but the cut is wrong for Lucy. She needs a full-cup bra that will support her properly and although M&S describes this as a full-cup, it’s actually a half-cup with a deep lace trim, that’s constructed in a way that dragged Lucy’s breasts down. 6/10

LACE

MEASURING PROCESS: Despite a huge choice, there are no guides to tell you how to find a bra that fits, only a list of the different styles. Given that the 32-band bras I’d tried from M&S and Bravissimo had been slightly on the tight side, I gambled on a larger back size — and, as Bravissimo suggested, a smaller cup. I ordered a 34E in the Prima Donna Twist Nostalgia Balcony bra (£42), which caught my eye.

ORDERING TIME: Delivery is £3 and can take up to five working days.

MY VERDICT: This bra is slightly padded, which makes it very comfortable. It seemed to fit well. The cup size worked and I didn’t get the ‘four boob’ effect that often happens when I spill out of a bra. My only quibble would be that the shoulder straps are too narrow.

EXPERT VERDICT: Quite a good bra for Lucy as it’s bigger around her rib cage, which she needs. It has a good shape and will work well under a T-shirt. But there is not enough support and only one hook and eye at the back. 8/10

FINAL VERDICT

It’s ironic that for all the fancy approaches to measuring, the bra that Allison thought fitted me best was from the site that gave no guidance on how to find a bra that fits. While I’m loath to tackle the Christmas crowds, this has rather proved that there’s no substitute for going into a shop, being properly fitted and trying on bras.
