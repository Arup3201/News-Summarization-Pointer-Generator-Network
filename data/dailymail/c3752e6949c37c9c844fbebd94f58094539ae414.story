The lack of universities in some parts of England is depriving pupils of the chance to gain a degree – despite achieving good grades at school, according to a new study.

These middle-class higher education 'cold spots' can be found in the border areas between England and Wales, along the Cumbrian coast, in Humberside and North Yorkshire, from Kent to the Wash and in the south-west, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) said.

In Corringham and Fobbing, Thurrock, Essex, for instance, it would be expected, based on academic performance at school, that 43.4 per cent of school leavers would go to university – but the actual figure was just 25.6 per cent.

There are middle-class higher education 'cold spots' in the border areas between England and Wales, along the Cumbrian coast, in Humberside and North Yorkshire, from Kent to the Wash and in the south-west

The interactive HEFCE map below shows the cold and hot spots in England for university participation: 

The report painted a similar picture in Dorchester East, Dorset, where 48.1 per cent of school leavers would be expected to go on to higher education, but just 31.3 per cent actually did.

The picture, however, is fairly complex.

For example in Leeds and Birmingham, where there is a relatively high number of higher education institutions, the proportion of young people progressing to higher education is lower than expected in relation to their GCSE attainment.

With a few exception, much of Lincolnshire has a low proportion of students entering higher education. Red denotes low numbers, moving up through orange, yellow, turquoise and dark blue (the highest)

South Wales also has a high number of regions where students are largely not progressing to university

Likely due to free university places, Scotland has a high proportion of students entering higher education

The report is the first time that school and higher education data together with employment and mobility data has been meshed to give a comprehensive and detailed picture of higher education participation and provision, employment and graduate mobility.

Professor Madeleine Atkins, HEFCE Chief Executive, said that the report, which includes an interactive map of  the education cold spots, could be used to identify areas where new campuses could be built.

She said: 'The data shows us that the issues associated with higher education cold spots can often be complex.'

Coastal regions of the north-east also suffer from low number of those heading to university

She added: 'Higher education providers, working collaboratively with their local enterprise partnerships, will be able to use this powerful new toolkit to establish a detailed picture of higher education in their localities, enabling them to identify any gaps in provision, participation and the supply of graduates. 

'This provides a strong evidence base to explore potential solutions for delivering local economic recovery and growth.

'Universities and colleges play a key role as economic and social anchors in their local and wider communities. Working with local partners in this way to reach a joint understanding of the issues that affect them collectively, they can make an important contribution to the ongoing development of Strategic Economic Plans, and also, of course, to decisions about where and when to invest different forms of funding.'

The lack of universities in some parts of England is depriving some pupils of the chance to gain a degree

Earlier this year research showed that the number of students who are satisfied with their degree hit a record high, although thousands still said they are not happy with the overall quality of their course.

It revealed the vast majority of undergraduates are content with the teaching and learning resources on their course, but less happy with the assessment and feedback they receive.

Undergraduates at Bath University, Keele University, St Andrews University and St Mary's University College are among the happiest with their degree, according to the annual National Student Survey.
