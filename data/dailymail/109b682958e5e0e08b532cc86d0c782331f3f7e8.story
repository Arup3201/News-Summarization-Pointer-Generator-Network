Max Clifford, who was jailed for a string of indecent assaults, has lodged appealed against his sentence

Disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford has lodged an appeal against his sentence after he was jailed for eight years for a string of historic sex offences. 

Clifford, 71, was convicted earlier this month of eight indecent assaults, which he committed after luring and 'degrading' women through his celebrity connections.

He was the first person to be convicted under high profile Operation Yewtree and was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court to eight years in prison.

When Clifford was sentenced, Judge Anthony Leonard said that, due to the age of the offences, Clifford was charged under an 
act from 1956, which set the maximum term for each charge at two years.

Under later legislation passed in 2003, the maximum term would have been ten years.

For the worst instances, the charges would have been rape or assault by penetration, which attract a maximum life term.

The Court of Appeal today confirmed that Clifford had lodged the appeal.

Passing sentence, Judge Anthony Leonard told Clifford his personality and position in the public eye were the reasons his crimes - which took place between 1977 and 1984 - were not revealed earlier.

Judge Leonard said: 'The reason why they were not brought to light sooner was because of your own dominant character and your position in the world of entertainment which meant that your victims thought that you were untouchable, something that I think you too believed.'

He added: 'These offences may have taken place a long time ago, when inappropriate and trivial sexual behaviour was more likely to be tolerated, but your offending was not trivial, but of a very serious nature.'

The PR guru was jailed for eight years, after 
being convicted of historic sex offences under the high-profile 
Operation Yewtree. He and his wife Jo, pictured, started divorce 
proceedings after the verdicts

Clifford was charged with 11 counts 
of indecently assaulting seven women aged 14 to 19, between 1966 and 
1984.

He was cleared of two charges and jurors were unable to reach a decision on the third.

The former celebrity agent remained defiant after he was convicted, saying: 'I stand by everything I have said in the last 17 months.'

Clifford branded his accusers
 compensation-seekers and attention-hunters, labelling them as 'fantasists'.

He said he did not know any
 of his accusers, and although he had had sexual encounters with ‘many’ 
women, he said it was all consensual.

After the trial, it was confirmed that his wife Jo, 51, was filing for divorce.
