Over the course of his 60 year career in television, David Attenborough has encountered some of nature’s most incredible and intriguing animals.

But the veteran broadcaster has revealed that his absolute favourite of all the planet’s creatures is a nine-month old human baby.

‘The one creature that really makes my jaw sag, that I find absolutely fascinating so much that I can hardly stop looking at it is a nine month old human baby,’ said 88-year-old Sir David.

Veteran broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, 88, has revealed that his absolute favourite of all the planet’s creatures is a nine-month-old human baby. The wildlife expert said he finds them 'absolutely fascinating'

‘The rate at which that grows. The rate at which that learns. The rate at which it acquires words. I mean, human babies are the most extraordinary of all creatures. They are the most complex. To me, nothing compares to it.’

He also confirmed that, of all the places he has visited on earth, his favourite is not the fascinating Galapagos islands or the plains of Africa, but the south west London district of Richmond-upon-Thames. 

‘That is true,’ he said. ‘Actually, when it comes to it, what makes a place is the people who live there and my family have lived there for a very long time.’

Sir David has two children, Robert and Susan, and several grandchildren who are now adults. He has previously spoken about his concerns that his grandchildren may never see polar bears in the wild.

Speaking at the launch of the new series of his documentary Natural Curiosities which begins on Watch February 2nd, Sir David was also quick to answer when asked about his least favourite animal.

‘Rats, rats, rats,’ he replied, without a moment of hesitation, before telling an audience at the London Zoo about several unfortunate experiences he has had with the rodents.

‘I’ve had rats crawling over my face at night,’ he said. ‘And I don’t want to put you off your meals, but I was in India recently and I’m not usually afflicted, but I did have a case of, you know.

'I had to run for a loo and I sat on the loo and I did what I had to do, and then this rat came out from between my thighs. That is not endearing.’

He admitted that he often gives a range of answers when asked about his favourite animals, depending on what he has been thinking about recently.

Another animal to make it onto his list of favourites is the weedy seadragon, a relation of the seahorse which can camouflage itself against the seabed.

He said: ‘If you’ve never seen the courtship dance of the weedy seadragon then life has still got great treats in store for you.

Sir David also expressed his love for the Octopus. ‘They are the most extraordinarily intelligent animals,’ he said. 

‘And ravens. I had a friend who had a raven and I watched it being given a bottle with a piece of meat in it. And straightaway it dipped it in a pond and shook the food out. It took all of 30 seconds.

‘I said to its owner, “you must have trained it to do that” but he said that it had learned to do it on its own in about two minutes.’

Father of two Sir David, who is brother to the late director Richard Attenborough, said that his interest in animals was recently echoed by a seven-year-old girl who had written to him about one of his programmes.

‘I had a sweet letter from a girl who said she liked the programme. She ended the letter by saying “I like animals because they are very different” and I thought, yeah, she’s hit it on the head. That’s exactly why I like animals, because they are different.’
