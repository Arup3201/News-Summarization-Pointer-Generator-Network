For more than 40 years, Evans has dominated the plus-size fast fashion market in the UK. But that could all be about to change.

Australian retailer Taking Shape arrived this summer, offering 'curvy customers' a new type of style boasting a 'sassy Aussie vibe'.

A huge hit down under where it has 130 shops, the brand aims to open 14 UK stores by the end of October, with boutiques opening in Newcastle and Liverpool this week.

Stylish: Taking Shape aims to provide an alternative source of fashion for larger ladies

By February the brand hopes to have 21 UK stores, including branches in Leamington Spa, Horsham, Newbury, Kingston, Solihull and Worcester. 

'We're excited to have arrived on the UK high street,' said Taking Shape managing director Alla Buinowicz.

'We believe that there is a great need here for both our garments and commitment to providing a unique and caring shopping experience.

'Everything we do is about you, the customer, what makes you look good and what makes you feel great.

'We're more than just a chain of shops; our goal is for women to enter as customers and leave as friends!'

Convenient: Taking Shape is also employing in-store stylists to encourage curvy women to be more daring

Other innovations introduced by 
Taking Shape include turning the fitting rooms into a 'retreat' that's 
larger than the average changing spot, and employing shop assistant stylists with a brief to ensure customers leave looking and 
feeling as good as possible.

The
newly launched shops and website represent the brand's first foray 
into international markets, with the UK chosen because Taking Shape has a 'greater affinity' with local British buyers.

Nevertheless,
with only 30 stores planned so far, it's still a fraction of the size of 
Evans - which has 300 outlets in the UK alone - and lacks the British 
brand's roster of edgy design talent, which currently includes Clements 
Ribeiro.

GIVE COLOUR A CHANCE

'I've lost 
count of the number of times I’ve heard a customer say "Ooh no I never 
wear that colour" but then I get her into the fitting room and trying on
all kinds of colours she wouldn't normally wear.

'My tip is: have a play, step out of your comfort zone and try 
on new colours. The right colours for you can make you look healthy and 
glowing - people will notice and tell you how good you look.'

LAYER, LAYER, LAYER

'Many
of us have parts of our body that we aren't fond of - an ample derriere
or a pudding tummy are complaints I come across often.

'The Taking Shape
range is full of cleverly designed styles that help take the focus off 
these extra assets. My tip is: if you layer a long line body tank over 
trousers it skims lumps and bumps and creates a lean foundation to 
build an outfit from.

'Add a printed tunic, vest or top and a piece of 
chunky jewellery and you have an attractive outfit that you'll feel 
confident in.'

DIVERT THE EYE

'Straight lines across your 
body can be less than flattering and accentuate your middle.

'Mixing the 
lines, lengths and textures of your clothing creates interest in your 
outfit and distracts the eye.

My tip is: try asymmetrical hems, crushed
fabrics, and textures such as mesh and lace to create stunning 
outfits.'
