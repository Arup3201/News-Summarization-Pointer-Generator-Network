Stephen Onley had hip surgery in December 2010 and doctors ignored his request that an epidural was not used. He is pictured with wife, Caroline

A social worker who cared for people with spinal injuries has sued the NHS after he underwent a hip operation that left him permanently paralysed.

Stephen Onley, 52, went under the knife for a routine procedure but doctors ignored his request that an epidural was not used.

The grandfather, who had spent years working with disabled people, asked staff not to use an epidural to numb the area because he was aware of the risk of spinal injury.

However, staff said it was necessary and administered it while he was under general anaesthetic.

They then failed to monitor him properly after surgery and his blood pressure fell so low that his spinal cord was deprived of blood - leading to paralysis from the waist down.

As a result, he is now bedridden.

The irreparable damage wasn’t spotted until nearly two days after surgery when an MRI scan confirmed he would never be able to walk again.

Mr Onley, from Bromsgrove, Worcester, is now wheelchair-bound and completely reliant on around-the-clock care from his wife Caroline, 55.

He underwent the procedure in 2010 at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham - which has now admitted responsibility.

He said: 'I had spent more than 35 years caring for people with spinal injuries and so I was only too aware that epidurals carry a small risk of paralysis.

'I had made up my mind not to have an epidural under any circumstances but was told that it was recommended.

'As a result of the mistakes the hospital made through not monitoring my blood pressure, I will never walk again.

'My lack of mobility has also meant I have now developed painful pressure sores and for the past year I have been virtually bedridden.

'I am now completely reliant upon my wife who has to care for me round the clock. Caroline has been fantastic and I don’t know how I would have coped without her.'

The NHS Trust admitted full responsibility for both the irreversible spinal damage as well as a perforated bowel which he suffered due to further inadequate care.

Following the surgery staff at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham failed to monitor Mr Onley's blood pressure and it fell so low that his spinal cord was deprived of blood causing him to be permanently paralysed

A future settlement, which medical law experts Irwin Mitchell are thrashing out with the Trust, will provide the lifetime of care and equipment Mr Onley needs.

The problems began in December 2010 when he underwent routine resurfacing surgery on his right hip and doctors inserted an epidural to help control post-operative pain.

In the hours that followed the surgery routine blood pressure checks were missed and by the next day Mr Onley’s blood pressure had fallen dangerously low.

But it was not until two days later that night-staff suspected there was a problem when he appeared to have no feeling or movement from the waist down.

An MRI scan later that day confirmed that he was permanently paralysed.

Mr Onley spent two months in hospital and a further six months in a rehabilitation unit. He is now virtually bedridden and his wife, Caroline, has to care for him 24 hours a day

As a result, Mr Onley had to spend more than two months in hospital and a further six months in a specialist spinal injuries unit, before finally being allowed home in August 2011.

Graham Bragg, Active Chief Executive at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, apologised to Mr Onley for the blunder.

He said: 'We are sorry for the complications Mr Onley experienced. A number of allegations have been made regarding his treatment.

'We have admitted liability regarding some aspects of the management of the complications Mr Onley experienced and apologised to him.

'We are committed to providing an excellent service and continually recognise the need to learn from our failings to improve the service we provide to all patients.'

The NHS Trust admitted full responsibility for both the irreversible spinal damage as well as a perforated bowel which he suffered due to further inadequate care

Lawyer Tim Deeming, from Irwin Mitchell solicitors, who is representing him, said: 'Stephen and Caroline have been devastated by what has happened.

'Apart from suffering hip pain, Stephen was a fit and active individual and believed that within a few weeks he would be recovered and back at work.

'To be told the news that you will spend the rest of your life reliant upon a wheelchair is unimaginable and to discover that this life long injury is as a result of a mistake which was entirely avoidable, has been incredibly hard for them both to come to terms with.

'Sadly this is not the first time that I have dealt with catastrophic injuries resulting from epidurals.

'Although no amount of money will ever turn back the clock for Stephen, we will now work with the Trust to provide Stephen with the financial support he requires.'
