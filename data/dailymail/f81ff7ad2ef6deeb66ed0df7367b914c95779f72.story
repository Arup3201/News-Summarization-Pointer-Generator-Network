These spooky pictures which appear to show spirits hovering ominously over the heads of the living have gone on display for the first time in the Titanic Quarter in Belfast.

They have been released just in time for Halloween by the Public Record Office Northern Ireland (PRONI) and all feature a Lieutenant Colonel E J Gordon Tucker after being found in his records.

Taken shortly after the First World War the pictures were taken at a time when many people wanted to contact loved ones who had died in the conflict.

Lieutenant Colonel E J Gordon Tucker and his companions are pictured after taking part in what is believed to have been a séance. They all seem unaware of the presence of a veiled woman leaning ominously over them

Lieutenant Colonel Tucker was a retired army officer who served in India and was a keen spiritualist

From the UK alone more than 700,000 men died during the Great War - and many families never had the chance to say goodbye.

Spiritualism and communing with the dead experienced a massive surge in popularity - and had an unlikely champion. 

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, turned to spiritualism following the death of his son Kingsley in 1918. 

He sank into a deep depression and like many grieving parents he was desperate to speak with his son - something spiritualism offered.

He became a vocal supporter of  spiritualism following the war and remained one for the rest of his life.

Although the exact method used to create the images pictured is unknown, it is believed the ghostly apparitions were actually man-made using double exposure or by creating a 'spirit-like' mannequin.

Catherine Millar, from the PRONI, said: 'Unfortunately we don't know how the spirits appeared. We will have to leave it to everyone's imagination.

'These images are in the context of a huge surge of interest in spiritualism after the First World War. Lieutenant Colonel Tucker was a retired army officer who served in India and a keen spiritualist.

'Lieutenant Tucker came from Oxford and it appears he had relatives in Ireland. The photographs appear to show Lt Col Tucker and companions and images of 'spirits' possibly after a séance.

'Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, devoted his life to spiritualism after the death of his brother and son during the Great War, although paradoxically Sherlock Holmes frowned upon such practices and solved crimes with the power of the mind.'

Alan Robertson, from the PRONI, said: 'These photographs show 'spiritualist manifestations' surrounding people who were involved in a séance.

'They appear as 'faces' surrounded by white mist known as 'ectoplasm'.

'Many people had lost family members in the First World War without having the opportunity to say goodbye.

'During the 1920s and 1930s, some sought comfort by trying to contact their missing loved ones through their belief in spiritualism.'
