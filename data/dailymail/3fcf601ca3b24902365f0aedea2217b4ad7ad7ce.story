Winter in Britain could be set to get much worse as weather conditions are becoming more volatile because of changes in pressure over the North Atlantic, scientists have warned.

While most seasons have not changed dramatically over the past century - studies have shown that winter is becoming much more unpredictable.

A study of seasonal records dating back to 1899 by the University of East Anglia (UEA), 
University of Sheffield and the Met Office found that seven out of the 
10 most extreme winter conditions over the last 115 years have occurred 
in the last decade.

Marked differences between centres of low and high barometric pressure (known as Iceland and the Azores, respectively) cause strong westerlies, bringing mild, wet and often stormy weather (left) in winter. Weaker differences cause the jet stream to wander into a 'blocking' position, bringing drier and snowier weather

The results suggest the idea of a typical British 'white' winter is increasingly becoming a myth, with one year experiencing mild but stormy conditions while deep snow could follow 12 months later.

Professor Phil Jones, from the University of East Anglia’s climatic research unit, said: 'This indicates that British winters have become increasingly unsettled.

'If this trend continues, we can expect more volatile UK winter weather in decades to come.'

Winter conditions are commonly defined using North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) - a system of barometric pressure variations which indicates the strength of westerly winds approaching the UK.

When there are marked differences between low and high centres of barometric pressure - known as Iceland and the Azores, respectively - westerly winds are strong, Britain experiences mild, wet and often stormy weather - like last winter.

Weaker differences or reverse airflow typically brings cold, snowy weather, such as that experienced in 2009/10 and 2010/11.

The variations were particularly noticeable in early winter.

Mr Jones said: 'When we look at the month of December in particular, our data shows that over the last 115 years, three out of five all-time record high NAO values and two out of five record lows took place in the last decade.'

Professor Edward Hanna, from the University of Sheffield’s department of geography, said it was too soon to say whether the increased volatility is linked to global warming.

The results suggest the idea of a typical British 'white' winter is increasingly becoming a myth, with one year experiencing mild but stormy conditions while deep snow could follow 12 months later

But the study, published in the International Journal Of Climatology, states that it was extreme unlikely the clustering of extreme conditions had happened by chance.

The trend could be due to random fluctuations in the climate system but could equally be due to factors including changing pressure and weather systems over the Arctic, especially Greenland, and changes in energy coming from the sun.

Mr Hanna said: 'We cannot use these results directly to predict this winter’s weather but, according to the long-term NAO trend, we can say that the probability of getting extreme winter weather - either mild/stormy or cold/snowy - has significantly increased in the last few decades.'
