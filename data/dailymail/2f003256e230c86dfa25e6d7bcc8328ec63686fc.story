Random shots: New York City Police Officer Brendan Cronin, who was off duty at the time, was arrested on an assault charge on Wednesday, April 30, 2014, after police say he apparently fired his service weapon at random, wounding a suburban New York man who was shot six times while he was sitting in a car at a stoplight

Two off-duty drunk NYPD police officers were arrested on Wednesday for firing their guns at members of the public, including one who emptied 13 rounds from his handgun - hitting a man in a nearby car six times.

Officer Brendan Cronin, 27, who is assigned to the 46th precinct in the Bronx, was driving in Pelham, Westchester late on Tuesday night when he fired at a total stranger, who was sitting in the passenger side of a car at traffic lights.

Cronin had drunk so much beforehand that he told officers afterwards that he 'doesn't remember what happened', according to a police source.

Then, three hours later, outside outside a Somerset County strip club in New Jersey, NYPD Sgt. Wanda Anthony shot at least one round at a former boyfriend and his new girlfriend.

Luckily no one was struck and Anthony fled the scene in a car, but was pulled over and charged with drunk driving after the incident.

Cronin has been charged with first-degree assault for the unprovoked shooting of the 47-year-old man.

Pelham Police Department Chief Joseph Benefico said that Cronin emptied the clip on his 9-mm Glock handgun.

'Dangerous and bizarre,' Benefico said to CBS News. 'We have no motive as of yet.

'We have not been able to find any link between the two persons,' he added. 'We have nothing to link either party to each other â€“ no road rage, nothing.

'The initial indication is that this was a random act.'

Cronin had apparently been drinking at a bar on City Island before shooting the victim in the torso, arm and hands.

He is currently recovering in a New Rochelle Hospital.

Unprovoked: Officer Brendan Cronin had allegedly been drinking before the shooting

Cronin was arrested while driving with his hazard lights on, said police after refusing to take a breathalyzer test.

Police had responded to a 911 report of a man driving erratically and as officers approached his car, Cronin brandished his handgun out of the window before dropping it.

'I personally am very disturbed about a number of incidents in recent weeks that are part of a long-term problem of inappropriate use of alcohol by members of the department,' NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said according to the New York Daily News.
