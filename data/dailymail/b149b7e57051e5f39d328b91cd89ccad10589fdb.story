Cleared: Gary Davies was cleared of attempted murder after slashing his girlfriend's throat when she ended their two-month relationship

A student who 'sawed' his girlfriend's neck with a kitchen knife after she ended their two-month relationship has today been cleared of attempted murder.

Gary Davies locked 19-year-old Robyn Clegg-Gibson in her bedroom before slashing a 7cm cut across her throat, because he was concerned about 'losing face' in front of her friends.

The 26-year-old, who denied attempted murder but admitted two charges of wounding with intent and false imprisonment, lashed out at the teenager in the early hours of September 30 last year.

After the couple returned home to Miss Clegg-Gibson's house at Lancaster University, where they both studied, Davies dealt five blows with a serrated kitchen knife, because he 'wanted to leave a scar'.

Giving evidence at his trial at Preston Crown Court, Davies, who was described as a 'demanding' boyfriend, said he originally grabbed a pair of scissors to scare his girlfriend.

He told the court he became 'angry and upset', when Miss Clegg-Gibson ended the relationship.

He said: 'I wanted to scare her but I didn’t think scissors were intimidating enough, then I saw the knife in the drawer.

'I wanted to give her something to remember not to mess with me. I was losing face as I saw it with her and her friends.

'The argument was trivial but it was still on my mind. I was worked up. I started thinking she was going to get away with this but I’m going to get in trouble.

'I was angry and upset and I wanted to leave a scar. I wanted to give her something to remember everytime she looks in the mirror. I was just stabbing everywhere.'

After telling Davies she wanted to end their relationship, Miss Clegg-Gibson allowed him into her home to look for his keys, which he claimed he had lost during their night out.

Help: Miss Clegg-Gibson called police while Davies grabbed a knife from downstairs. Threatening her, he told her to call them back, and tell officers they were not needed at the address

Growing uncomfortable at his presence, she asked him to leave her bedroom, but Davies refused.

While she reached for the phone to call the police, Davies - an astrology student at the university - went into the kitchen and grabbed a knife.

When he returned to Miss Clegg-Gibson's bedroom he locked the door behind him.

Threatening her with a knife, Davies told Miss Clegg-Gibson to call the police back and tell them not to come to the address.

But minutes later a police officer arrived, sending Davies into a panic.

Prosecutor Paul Cummings, told the court: 'He climbed on top of her and started to saw at her neck. She had her hand up and was trying to stop him.

'She was curled up in a ball on the floor bleeding and could feel the knife on her throat.'

Davies, who was also in his first year at university but lived in different student accommodation, was stopped when the police officer kicked down the door.

Haunted: Robyn Clegg-Gibson seen arriving at Preston Crown Court, has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the terrifying attack last September

Demanding: She told the jury he had been 'very demanding', wanting to see her every day after they met through a friend

His victim suffered a 7cm cut across her neck, which had cut deep into fatty tissue but had not severed a blood vessel or caused nerve damage.

Miss Clegg-Gibson, who told the jury during the trial that she thought she was going to die, has received counselling since the attack and is having more sessions starting next month to help her cope with her ordeal.

Following sessions over the Christmas period, her counsellor concluded that she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, struggles to sleep and remains 'anxious and uneasy'.

A jury of seven men and five women found Davies not guilty of attempted murder and returned the unamimous verdict after 32 minutes of deliberations.

He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on April 14 for the other charges after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.
