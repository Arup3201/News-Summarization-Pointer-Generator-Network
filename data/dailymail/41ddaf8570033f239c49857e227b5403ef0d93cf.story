Bill Shankly, as always, had an idea. Not content with beating opponents with style, he wanted teams to be trembling at the mere sight of Liverpool.

So, having watched Real Madrid and been struck by the stunning simplicity of their white kit, Shankly made a radical change on November 25, 1964. In a European Cup tie against Anderlecht at Anfield, Liverpool wore all red for the first time in their history and never looked back.

‘He thought the colour scheme would carry a psychological impact,’ Ian St John, who scored the first goal that night, would later recall. ‘Red for power, red for danger.’

Tuesday marked the 50th anniversary from when Liverpool changed their kit from white shorts to all red

On the 50th anniversary of that seismic change, when Liverpool stopped wearing white shorts and socks, Brendan Rodgers used words that Shankly would have expected in conjunction with a red shirt - resilience, spirit, character - but not from a front-foot position.

This has been a chastening period for the current incumbent of the Anfield manager’s seat, a run of four consecutive defeats sending Liverpool’s campaign to the brink of crisis. No longer a garment to elicit fear, it has been the outfit this campaign of a team perceived to be a soft touch.

In the wake of Sunday’s capitulation at Crystal Palace, Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher led the criticism, lambasting his old team’s mental weakness. As Liverpool look to preserve their Champions League status here in Bulgaria on Wednesday, Rodgers explained why he saw things differently.

‘We hear criticism of the team but this team has character - it showed it last season,’ said Rodgers. ‘It has got resilience. OK, we concede more than we would like at times but you can’t question the character. It can’t be criticised. We have players who’ve shown they have spirit.

Liverpool's defeat to Crystal Palace was their fourth straight in all competitions

If Basle pick up more points than Liverpool, then Brendan Rodgers’ side are out. If Basle lose, Liverpool could still survive for the final match-day, even if they lose to Ludogorets. If Liverpool win, it will all come down to their final group match against Basle next month.

‘But when you don’t get victories it is life. If you don’t do it with confidence you don’t do it quite as good. My job is to keep instilling it. It (being easily beatable) is a comment that has been made. It’s something when you’re paid to be critics - well, not critics - but to assess the team.

‘When you lose games, what I’ve learnt is that people will say what they want. That is what comes. I’ve said before whether criticism is deserved or not you won’t like it. You just have to ignore it, you just have to not listen to it. I have a team full of characters, full of people fully committed.

‘Hopefully that’s something that will improve. But we need to improve, we need to be better. You talk about sport - you need to have persistence, you need to have resilience. That persistence gets you through. Losing can be the making of you.’

That last point is debatable. Rodgers has never lost five consecutive games as a manager but if the current sequence extends and Liverpool falter against opponents who pushed them so close at Anfield in September, the atmosphere on Merseyside will descend further.

Rodgers, to his credit, never ducked an issue on Tuesday night and, describing his role as one of the ‘pillars of the team and the club’, he set a positive tone. He is not in the mood to dwell on the wretched results that have tumbled one after another.

There was, though, realism and pragmatism in his message. Rodgers’ dream maybe to inflict ‘death by football’ on teams but he is not going to kill Liverpool’s campaign by pursuing it to the detriment of everything else.

That is why in the Vasil Levski Stadium, he will make Liverpool something they haven’t been - difficult to beat. Brazil midfielder Lucas will come in to bolster the midfield, enabling Steven Gerrard to move forward, and Kolo Toure will return, to plug the holes Dejan Lovren has been leaving.

‘That (getting a result) has been the case now for a number of weeks,’ said Rodgers. ‘The philosophy is important and we know how we want to work but you need to get results. You need to find results. We would take a scrappy win.

‘Listen, you can’t play perfect football. It is going to be tough. We want to get a result.’

And why does he retain faith that they will leave their moribund form behind and, somehow, sneak a place in the knockout stages?

‘It is sport,’ he replied. ‘It is football. If we didn’t feel that we could, we may as well pack up and go home. We all work tirelessly at our jobs. I am a better manager than I was 12 months ago because of experience.

‘The players are working so, so hard and are fully committed. We need to improve but when the tide turns - which it will do - we will be in a better place to move on. Sometimes it just takes a game, an action to change a season for you. We have to believe that can happen.’
