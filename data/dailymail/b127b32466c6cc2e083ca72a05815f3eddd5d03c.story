In the same week that Condé Nast have launched a magazine targeting teenagers,  British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman has revealed she is making a film for schools which highlights 'the difference between fashion and reality and how a fashion image is constructed.'

The 55-year-old said the aim of the documentary, which goes behind the scenes of a fashion shoot, is to help give today's youngsters a more positive outlook on their body image.

It will show the secondary school pupils how models only achieve a flawless look with the help of make-up, lighting and airbrushing.

'I'm hoping that it will be fun for the pupils but, actually, it will make some serious points,' Alexandra told the Independent on Sunday.

Vulnerable target market: Miss Vogue is aimed at teenagers

She admitted that the art of Photoshopping was only a 'tiny part' of the trickery used to make models look younger and slimmer.

'It's basically a huge team of people that go in to create the image, of which retouching is the icing on the cake. You can do far more with lighting and make-up,' she said.

The film is currently being edited and it is hoped it will be distributed over the summer so schools can show it from their Autumn terms onwards.

It seems the film is well-timed given that Condé Nast this week published the first edition of Miss Vogue, a sister edition to their glossy aimed at 17-year-olds.

Daily Mail columnist Liz Jones expressed concern in today's paper that the teen mag could 'brainwash' young girls who are 'vulnerable and easily led' into chasing unrealistic ideals on how they should look.

She said: 'I fell in love with Vogue in 1975, when I was 17. In some ways it improved my life - it made me dream beyond the dull shores of Essex. Yet it also almost destroyed it - because as an unattractive, acne-riddled provincial lump, I wanted the bodies and lives of the women on its pages.

'But being naive, airbrushing simply never occurred to me. I had no idea it was all artifice, a fantasy world. I thought I had to live out its pages.'

Advertisers have been rapped in the 
past for over airbrushing - thereby giving consumers a false impression 
of how effective their product is. For example, Olay were once said to 
have breached advertising standards by airbrushing out too many of 
Twiggy's wrinkles.

Meanwhile Keira Knightley has complained about the way her small breasts are often airbrushed on film posters and in magazines.

'They
always pencil in my boobs. I was only angry when they were really 
droopy,' she said in an interview with Allure referring to a King Arthur
poster where her breasts were enlarged.

LIGHTING: Bright studio lights are a must on shoots along with studio umbrellas. These illuminate the models and reduce darkness and shadows so they look more radiant. The angle and position of the lights along with backlights and reflectors all help flatter the subject.

POSE: Models can drop pounds just by the way they stand. Good posture and positioning all make a difference. Standing slightly side on, one leg in front of the other can make the figure look more elongated. A hand on the hip and a head tilted to the side is also used for a more flattering look.

MAKE-UP: Professional make-up artists can take years off models with the right products and application. Concealers, foundations and powders are all combined to hide lines, bags under the eyes and blemishes. Illuminating concealers under the eyes can make them seem brighter while the way it's applied around the nose can make it appear smaller.

AIRBRUSHING: Retouching an image is the 'icing on the cake' according to Alexandra Shulman. Any blemishes or lines that haven't been hidden by the previous tricks can be removed. The body shape of the model can also be completely changed by slimming down their legs, arms and waist in seconds. However, the process has also led to some noticeable mistakes such as models appearing with missing fingers or implausibly skinny legs.
