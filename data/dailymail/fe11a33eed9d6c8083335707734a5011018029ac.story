The controversial badger cull was postponed at the eleventh hour yesterday after ministers said there were too many of the animals for two pilot schemes to be carried out effectively.

The Government was accused of ‘shambolic’ planning for announcing that the culls would have to be put off until next year, days before they were due to start.

The decision came after a survey showed badger numbers were twice as high as expected in the two pilot areas. With too few trained marksmen, it would be difficult to meet targets to kill enough badgers to reduce tuberculosis in cattle.

As well as the problems over badger numbers, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson also blamed the wet summer, legal challenges by animal charities and a police request to wait until after the Olympics for delaying the pilot culls so that they could not be carried out during the ‘open season’ which runs until the end of January.

Government advisers say 70 per cent of badgers in each of the pilot cull areas must be killed within six weeks to reduce disease. Otherwise, it could actually exacerbate the problem because badgers would flee the cull area and spread TB further afield.

Farmers, who back the cull in the hope it will reduce TB in cattle which has devastated the dairy industry, were assured by Mr Paterson that it will go ahead next June. He insisted it was not a U-turn and that he was ‘utterly convinced’ a cull would help tackle the disease which killed 26,000 cattle last year and has cost the taxpayer £500million.

A Government-commissioned study of badger culls in the 1990s showed a 16 per cent decrease in bovine TB in nine years.

But campaigners who claim shooting thousands of the much-loved animals would not reduce TB and could make it worse were celebrating the stay of execution.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is to give a statement to MPs today in which he is expected to say the badger cull will still go ahead, but not until next year. Queen guitarist Brian May (right) has led a campaign opposing the cull

The issue has provoked strong passions
with animal rights activists threatening to disrupt the shootings, and 
150,000 people signing a petition against the policy. Animal lovers say 
many healthy badgers will be killed.

The cull was finally plunged in doubt 
last week after farmers’ estimates of 2,000 badgers in each pilot area 
in the South-West were found to be wide of the mark.

Natural England, which is handing out 
the cull licences, became concerned last month and commissioned a 
recount, which found 3,500 in Gloucestershire and 4,300 in West 
Somerset.

Mr Paterson told MPs: ‘Despite a 
greatly increased effort over the last few days and weeks, the farmers 
delivering this policy have concluded that they cannot be confident that
it will be possible to remove enough badgers based on these higher 
numbers and considering the lateness of the season.

The decision to order a cull has attracted emotional protests and legal challenges

‘Having looked at all the evidence 
over many years, I am utterly convinced that badger control is the right
thing to do. I remain fully committed to ensuring the pilot culls can 
be delivered effectively, safely and humanely next summer.’

NFU president Peter Kendall said the 
higher numbers left farmers with a ‘huge challenge’ to meet the targets 
for disease control and ‘reluctantly’ it had been decided to delay.

Labour’s environment spokesman Mary Creagh said: ‘The Government’s handling of the cull has been incompetent and shambolic.’

She added that a cull ‘would cost 
farmers more than it saved them, put a huge strain on the police, and 
spread bovine TB in the short term as badgers move out of cull areas’.

And scientist Lord Krebs, who devised the trial cull in the 1990s said the Government needed ‘rethink its strategy’ and that culling would have only ‘limited effect’.

Dairy farmer David Horton from South Devon, who said his own herd had 
been hit by TB, described the delay as a ‘disaster’ for the industry.

He said: ‘We have been waiting to see 
some action and now we have had this action postponed and everyone will 
be devastated.’ James Small, 37, who owns 1,000-acre Warren Farm near 
Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, said: ‘As a livestock farmer I am very 
disappointed that we have a delay in trying to make a start on tackling 
the disease.’

The father of two, who owns 177 cows 
and lost two animals to TB this year, added: ‘This won’t be solved in 
one or two years, it will take about 15 years, but every time we delay 
now, it will add on more and more years at the back end.

‘The disease is spreading across the country now.’
