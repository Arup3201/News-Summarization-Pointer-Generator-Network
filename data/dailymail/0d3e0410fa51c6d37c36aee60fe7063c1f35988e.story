A murderer who walked out of an open prison more than 17 years ago remains on the run, police admitted last night.

Raymond Lenihan, 57, is one of 24 prisoners who are still missing after absconding from Sudbury Prison.

But information about the killer, who was jailed for life in 1977 at Leicester Crown Court for murder, has only just been released.

His disappearance in 1997 came to light during an urgent police internal inquiry into a series of prisoners who ‘slipped through the net’.

It was ordered by Derbyshire Police Chief Constable Mick Creedon after the Daily Mail revealed one killer spent nine years on the run.

Hell’s Angel David Richards, 53, was even able to claim benefits, obtain a passport and even go overseas on holiday thanks to blundering police.

He was only re-arrested after this newspaper exposed how he had fallen through cracks in the system after simply walking out of his jail.

The ensuing row forced Derbyshire Police to review its failings and it found 24 other offenders remain on the run from the same prison.

They include an array of dangerous criminals including violent attackers, drug traffickers, robbers, gunmen and fraudsters.

Details of those who escaped between 1992 and 2006 – 12 offenders, including Lenihan – had never been made public before.

The oldest among these is Delroy Howe, 45, who failed to return to prison from temporary leave on December 29, 1992. He was serving a sentence for drug offences.

Other wanted criminals include Michael Ashworth, 54, who disappeared in 1995 after being jailed for drugs offences, and violent criminal Leslie Warden, 58, who vanished in 1998.

The recent discovery of the number of missing and potentially dangerous prisoners has been a serious embarrassment for police.

Some chiefs fear that many more may be found if forces with open prisons in their areas examine their historical records.

Privately, they blame a misunderstanding over who should take the lead in tracking down wanted inmates and inaction by the prison authorities.

It is the force where the prison is located which is responsible for co-ordinating the manhunt, no matter where the prisoner is from or where his crime took place.

Yesterday, Richards was starting a further two-and-a-half year sentence after being told he may never be released.

Judge Philip Parker branded his escape ‘serious’ and said it created ‘harm and fear’ among the public.

Speaking at Wolverhampton Crown Court last Friday, he said it would be for the Parole Board to decide if it would ever be safe to release him.

He said: ‘The sentence I have passed merely marks the offence you have committed and it does not indicate when it would be safe to release you’

Richards was jailed for life in 1984 for hacking a teenage love rival to death and using his blood to write ‘Hell’s Angels’ on the wall.

But in 2005, as he approached the end of his sentence, he walked out of Sudbury Prison, in Derbyshire, because he was fed up with waiting to be released.

Local police refused to accept responsibility for finding him and simply logged the fact he had absconded on a national database.

As a result, Richards was able to start a new life, renting a flat near his frail parents, claim thousands in disability benefits and undertake odd jobs for elderly neighbours.

Shockingly, he even went to Ireland on holiday where he robbed a post office and was jailed for three months, without anyone realising he was on the run.

He was re-arrested in June in Wolverhampton by a team of Met detectives who travelled to the West Midlands after being tipped off by this newspaper.

The court heard that the authorities are still investigating how Richards, who is now held in a secure prison, was able to claim benefits and obtain a passport.

His lawyer Simon Hanns said: ‘The dangerous offender of many years ago is a far cry from the man who stands before you today.”

Derbyshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Martyn Bates said the force is now doing ‘everything possible’ to trace the remaining missing men.

He said: ‘The men did not previously live in Derbyshire and they committed offences elsewhere. They could now be anywhere, living under different names, which is why we’re making this public appeal.’
