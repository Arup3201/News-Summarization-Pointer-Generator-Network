A Christmas Day diner died and dozens of others became seriously ill after eating their turkey lunch at a pub where staff paid 'lip service' to safety procedures, a court heard today.

Mother-of-one Della Callagher, 46, died after paying £39.95 for the four-course lunch at the Railway Hotel, Hornchurch, Essex, on Christmas Day 2012.

She was among 33 people who fell ill following the alleged outbreak of food poisoning, later attributed to a bacteria known as Clostridium perfringens.

The restaurant's former owner Ann McSweeney, 40, and ex-chef Mehmet Kaya, 37, deny serving food that was unfit for human consumption.

Today, John Callagher, 53, described his wife's 'horrific' death, describing the moment she began shaking and rolled her eyes back while lying in bed next to him.

Mr Callagher, who breathed deeply throughout his evidence and sipped at a glass of water to keep his composure, said that his wife was in a 'great mood' on Chistmas Day because she loved being with her family.

He told the court that his wife began to feel unwell at around 5:30am on Boxing Day and he started to feel unwell about an hour later.

Mr Callagher said: 'We both had the same symptoms, but Della got progressively far worse than me as we went throughout the day, with vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pain.

'I called my mother-in-law, and said "you've got to come to the house".

'I was getting increasingly concerned as the day went on. The vomiting and diarrhoea wouldn't stop and Della was a very private person, and it was horrific to see what was going on.

'My mother-in-law called NHS Helpline first and that didn't seem to work, whatever that was, and then the paramedics were called by 999.

'My symptom's were nowhere near as bad as Della's. They gave her Diarolyte.

'Della was in quite a state physically so they took her in an ambulance to Queen's Hospital, Romford.'

He told the court that because of his food poisoning, he wasn't well enough to go with his wife.

He said: 'I couldn't. I wasn't in the physical state to go. My mother-in-law went and I think my brother-in-law joined them later at the hospital.

'The next thing I discovered, they were back at my house, my brother-in-law is a black taxi driver and he brought them back.'

He continued: 'They didn't take her in A&E because I think they were concerned it was the norovirus, even though it was clear - the paramedics said to me: "this looks like salmonella."

'They gave her a shot of something in the ambulance. They [A&E] sort of turned her away.'

He said she seemed a bit better, but in the afternoon or early evening she took a turn for the worse.

Mr Callagher said: 'She got far, far, far, worse. It was horrific.'

He said he called his mother-in-law again, asking her to come back to the house, adding: 'I didn't know what to do.

'I called my mother-in-law and she was going to come round and I was holding Della on the bed because I didn't want vomit to go down her throat, and she would choke.'

He added: 'Something changed. I felt her physically shake and her eyes rolled, as if she was having a cardiac arrest.'

He claimed that the ambulance took more than 45 minutes to arrive, as somebody instructed his brother how to do CPR.

He said: 'We had someone on the line who was instructing us to do CPR. My brother-in-law was giving her CPR and trying to save her, but there was no sign of life.

'My mother-in-law was very ill by this point. The paramedics took over and we went downstairs to let them do their job. We hoped for a different outcome, but she hadn't breathed now for 45 minutes.

'Paramedics took my brother-in-law outside and I think they was going to say she was clinically gone, and they then felt a pulse and they took her to hospital.'

Mr Callgher told the court that this time he travelled in the ambulance with his wife, regardless of his own condition. He said: 'It didn't matter to me what state I was in.

'I left with her and my mother-in-law left in a different ambulance.'

Mrs Callagher was pronounced dead at the hospital on December 27th at around 08:15am.

The pub's parent company, Mitchell and Butlers PLC, based in Birmingham, also deny the charge at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

McSweeney, of Hornchurch, and Kaya, of  Purfleet, Essex, also deny perverting the course of justice by falsifying records in a 'daily kitchen due diligence log' relating to the cooking and cooling of turkey meat. 

The pair are accused of failing to properly monitor the temperature of the turkey as it cooked.

Following the incident, they allegedly falsified their food safety records to hand to health and safety inspectors. 

McSweeney further denies obstructing an officer in the course of their duty by handing the falsified documents to food safety inspectors.

Andrew Campbell-Tiech, prosecuting, told the court: 'Mehmet Kaya grossly, grossly mismanaged the preparation of the Christmas turkey.

'By that act he caused his employer, the company, to place unsafe food before its customers on Christmas Day.

'Miss McSweeney was in overall charge. She knew, she must have known, that Mr Kaya did not follow safety procedures. Her default is clear, she should have intervened. She did not.'

Referring to the charge of perverting the course of justice, Mr Campbell-Tiech said: 'The actions of Miss McSweeney and Mr Kaya in the immediate aftermath of this tragedy were not those of innocent actors caught up in a tragedy not of their making.

'News of a possible food poisoning outbreak reached The Railway Hotel sometime in the morning on Boxing Day. Carole Rowe, a diner, had returned to the hotel to complain.'

He added: 'Miss McSweeney contacted the company, who by 1pm on Boxing Day were aware that six people had reported illness.

'Environmental Health Officers attended on the 27th and, by that time, all trace of the Christmas meal had disappeared. There were no samples for the officers to seize.'

He continued: 'Clearly the turkey breasts were cooked and cooled, otherwise they could not have been reheated and served the following day, Christmas Day. But when and for how long, we simply do not know.'

Mr Campbell-Tiech claimed the kitchen logbooks showed 'the kitchen of The Railway Hotel paid lip service only to the systems the company had prescribed but did not enforce'.

The trial continues.

The bacterium Clostridium perfringens is widely distributed in the environment and food. It is the third most common cause of food poisoning in the UK.

If spores of the bacteria survive cooking, they can germinate to form growing cells. Spores cannot grow in a refrigerator or freezer but thrive at room temperature.

In optimal growing conditions, the organism has a generation time of 10 to 12 minutes. When a large number of the vegetative cells are consumed this will more-likely-than-not lead to gastroenteritis.

Food poisoning from the bacteria most often occurs when foodstuffs, usually red meat or poultry, is prepared in advance and kept warm for several hours before serving.

The illness, with diarrhoea and abdominal pain the main symptoms, generally lasts for less than 24 hours but elderly people may be more seriously affected.

The bacteria is also responsible for 80-95 per cent of gas gangrene cases, a rare but severe form of gangrene.
