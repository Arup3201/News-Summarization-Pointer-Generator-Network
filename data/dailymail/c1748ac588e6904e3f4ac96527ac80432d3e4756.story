Mauricio Pochettino has leaped to the defence of Jan Vertonghen after former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood branded the Belgian a poor defender.

Sherwood, in his role as a TV pundit, criticised Vertonghen following his display in Spurs’ 3-0 defeat at Chelsea on Wednesday.

But Pochettino – who succeeded the axed Sherwood at White Hart Lane in the summer – said: 'People can have their opinions but I am very happy with Jan.

Vertonghen was criticised for allowing Loic Remy to easily turn him on the way to scoring Chelsea's third goal

'I am not aware of these comments. I give my opinions in private. I think Jan in his first season was maybe the best central defender in England.

'Maybe last season he was not as good but he is still a very important player for us.'

Vertonghen is expected to keep his place in Tottenham’s defence for their London derby at home with Crystal Palace on Saturday.

Harry Kane is likely to lead the Spurs attack after Eagles boss Neil Warnock revealed he looked into signing the England Under 21 star on loan in the summer.

Tim Sherwood was in charge of Spurs for six months last season and branded Vertonghen a poor defender following the Premier League defeat at Stamford Bridge

But Sherwood's replacement during the summer, Mauricio Pochettino has backed Vertonghen, calling him a very important player to the club as he gestures from the sideline during the London derby loss

'I hear this for the first time,' said Pochettino. 'Maybe it was possible but our idea from the first day was to give Harry Kane a chance to play.

'My idea was always to keep Harry. We believed him from day one and it showed we were right to keep him.'
