A new study has found eating probiotics could help lower blood pressure, protecting against heart disease and stroke

Eating probiotics regularly could help lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.

The live micro-organisms naturally occur in the gut but are also commonly found in yoghurt and dietary supplements.

Researchers at the Griffith Health Institute and School of Medicine in Australia examined data from nine trials involving more than 540 participants.

They found consuming the live bacteria lowered people's blood pressure levels - particularly in those with higher readings.

Probiotics with multiple species of bacteria also worked better than those containing a single type of bacterium.

Lead author Dr Jing Sun, said: 'The small collection of studies we looked at suggest 
regular consumption of probiotics can be part of a healthy lifestyle to 
help reduce high blood pressure, as well as maintain healthy blood 
pressure levels.

'This includes probiotics in yoghurt, fermented and sour milk and cheese, and probiotic supplements.'

Despite the benefits identified in consuming probiotics, the study found taking the supplements for less than eight weeks did not affect blood pressure.

Dr Sun added: 'We believe 
probiotics might help lower blood pressure by having other positive 
effects on health, including improving cholesterol, reducing blood glucose and insulin 
resistance; and by helping to regulate the hormone system that regulates
 blood pressure and fluid balance.

'The studies looking at probiotics and blood pressure tend to be small.

'Moreover,
 two studies had a short duration of three to four weeks of probiotic 
consumption, which might have affected the overall results of the 
analysis.'

She said 
additional studies are needed before doctors can confidently recommend 
probiotics for high blood pressure control and prevention.

The study was published in the journal Hypertension.

Commenting on the research, Victoria Taylor, Senior Dietitian at 
the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Having high blood pressure puts you
 at greater risk of cardiovascular disease including heart attack and 
stroke, so it’s vital we do all we can to keep our levels in check.

'While
 this is an interesting review of the research in this area, it’s too 
soon to start recommending probiotics for lowering blood pressure.

'With 
only a handful of studies involving a limited number of participants and
 conducted for only short periods, we need more research to confirm the 
findings seen here.

'In the
 meantime, there are a number of well-established lifestyle changes 
that we can make to keep our blood pressure healthy.

'Eating less salt, 
more fruit and vegetables and being physically active and maintaining a 
healthy body weight are all tried and tested ways to do this.'
