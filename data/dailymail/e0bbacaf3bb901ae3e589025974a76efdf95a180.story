A team of Russian carpenters have built a copy of the Captain Jack Sparrow's Black Pearl ship from the Caribbean movies and yarrgh, she really blows.

The questionable replica, which is being nailed together near the city of Abakan on the banks of the Yenisei River, is the brainchild of local carpenter and film fan Alexander Marchenko.

It could be because they have run short of doubloons or perhaps it's the freezing Russian winter but, as yet, their rickety-looking creation bears little resemblance to the movie ship.

Real thing: The impressive Black Pearl galleon which featured in all of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies

In the hit Disney films starring Johnny 
Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, the Black Pearl is depicted as 
an impressive galleon with a jet black hull and sails to match.

Loaded to the gundecks with cannon and crewed by the most fearsome pirates to be found anywhere on the Spanish Main, it is said to be the fastest ship on the seas.

The Russian version however appears rather less of a ship than a floating shed, with ugly square sides at the front, gaping holes in the hull and more than few rough edges.

The masts look like three spindly grey polls, there's not a single cannon to be seen and even the figurehead at the prow could do with a spruce up.

To their credit, the carpenters appear to be using little more than hand-tools for the build and there is some way to go before completion so they could surprise us yet.
