A teen Florida foot fetish performer and two male friends were arrested this week after having sex with girls aged 12, 13 and 14-years-old and bragging about it on social media, authorities said.

Bianca Byndloss, 19, of Miami, drove the underage girls to 18-year-old Christian Hernandez’s house Wednesday and had group sex while being filmed by Bryan Yanes, also 18, according to investigators.

A self-proclaimed ‘porn diva,’ Byndloss relentlessly promotes herself on Twitter and Tumblr advertising foot fetish sex shows she performs on Skype in exchange for money.

'Porn diva' and foot fetishist Bianca Byndloss, from Miami, has been charged with sex with a minor and promoting the sexual performance of a child after having group sex with three girls aged 12, 13 and 14 and two 18-year-old men

The trio had consensual sex with the minors while filming the acts, an arrest report cited by the Miami Herald said.

A video posted online showing the young girls in the act led to someone reporting the teens to police, and a warrant issued led cops to make more disturbing finds.

Footage of two of the underage girls performing oral sex on each other, a close up of one of the young girl’s genitals and various other pictures and videos of the encounter were discovered on Hernandez’s cell phone, police told WTVJ.

Police said that Byndloss drove the girls to Hernandez's home for the sex party last week. She is out on $37,500 bond

Byndloss’ Tumblr page shows her sticking her own foot in her mouth, licking her toes and performing a number of sex acts with her size five feet.

She was charged Thursday with lewd and lascivious battery on a minor and promoting sexual performance of a child.

The porn diva bailed out of Miami-Dade County Jail Friday after posting a $37,500 bond.

Hernandez was hit with the same charges and Yates faces only a charge of lewd and lascivious battery on a minor, records showed.
