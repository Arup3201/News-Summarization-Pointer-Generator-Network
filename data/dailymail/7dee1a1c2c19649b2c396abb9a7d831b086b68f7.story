An arsonist tried to burn down the San Francisco house used in the Robin Williams comedy Mrs Doubtfire over a perceived grudge with the current owner. 

The house is owned by eminent plastic surgeon Dr. Douglas K. Ousterhout who  told police that he is having problems with a former client, but is not sure who is responsible for the fire.

The house, which is on the junction of Steiner and Broadway in Pacific Heights, suffered scorch marks following Monday night's attack.

The house in Pacific Heights, San Francisco was used in the 1993 Robin Williams film Mrs Doubtfire

Police believe the attacker, who they believe used to be a former client of the owner, used petrol to start the fire. 

The front door also suffered damage. 

San Francisco Fire Department said the home owner was able to douse the flames after smelling smoke from inside the property. 

Police sealed-off an area surrounding the iconic building while they searched for forensic clues to link the attacker to the crime.

The 2,378 square foot house was built and 1906 and was bought in April 2000 for $1,395,000.

The property is a popular tourist destination in San Francisco with fans of Robin Williams regularly stopping off to have their photograph taken outside the film's location.
