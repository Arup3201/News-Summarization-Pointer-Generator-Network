Norwich are embroiled in a bizarre pre-season row over the identity of an Italian side they thrashed 13-0.

The Canaries thought they were playing Serie D side Saint-Christophy Vallee d'Aoste, after an original match against Novara was cancelled.

In fact the game was against a select XI from the Aosta region comprised of non-professional players.

Thrashing: The Canaries cruised to a 13-0 victory in Italy against an Aosta regional select side

Due to complanit from SC Vallee d'Aoste, Norwich have now updated the match report on their official website and released the following statement.

'In our original match report for this warm-up fixture, acting in good faith on the basis of information given to the club, we incorrectly reported that we had played against local club side SC Vallee d’Aoste.

'In fact the game was against an Aosta regional select side and we are happy to put the record straight and apologise to SC Vallee d’Aoste and their fans for the misunderstanding.

Preparation: The Canaries are preparing for life back in the Championship under Neil Adams this season following relegation from the Premier League

'The game was convened at very short notice following the late cancellation of our previously scheduled match against Novara.

'The hospitality shown to Norwich City Football Club by the people in Saint-Vincent and the surrounding area has been excellent and our training camp there has seen the squad continue to build their fitness levels, as we gear up for our three forthcoming friendlies against top-flight European opposition in the shape of SC Bastia, OGC Nice and Celta Vigo.'

Norwich City proved much too strong for their opponents as Neil Adams fielded a strong side to take on the locals as they eased to a 13-0 win at the Piergiorgio Perucca Stadium in Saint-Vincent.

The wave of goals included braces for Russell Martin, Anthony Pilkington, Jamar Loza and Jacob Murphy, plus further goals from Gary Hooper, Wes Hoolahan, Steven Whittaker, Nathan Redmond and Josh Murphy completed the rout.
