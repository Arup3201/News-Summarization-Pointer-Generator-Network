Harry Kane is the third highest goalscorer in Europe's top five leagues with only La Liga superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi ahead of the Tottenham star.

Barcelona ace Messi leapfrogged rival Ronaldo to lead the way as Europe's most potent striker by scoring a hat-trick against Rayo Vallecano to take his tally for the season up to 41 goals in 38 games.

Messi, who helped his side to an emphatic 6-1 win on Sunday, has now scored 40 goals or more in each of his last six seasons.

Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi leads the way after scoring a hat-trick against Rayo Vallecano 

Kane's double against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday put him level with Messi's Barcelona team-mate Neymar.

Both Kane and Neymar have scored 26 goals in all competitions during the course of the current campaign, with the Tottenham netting 18 Barclays Premier League goals thus far.

Kane's rise has been mesmeric. The 21-year-old run riot in his side's Europa League campaign, helped his side seal a spot in the Capital One Cup final and has played a major role in Tottenham's quest to finish in the top four.

He is also likely to earn his first senior England call-up later this month when Roy Hodgson, who was at Loftus Road on Saturday, names his squad to face Lithuania and Italy.

Mauricio Pochettino heaped praise on his star striker after his side's 2-1 win against QPR by calling the Tottenham star 'fantastic' but stressed there is room for improvement.

Cristiano Ronaldo is three goals behind Messi having scored 39 goals during the course of the season 

Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette has scored 25 goals while Sergio Aguero has found the net 23 times this season

'It was a fantastic performance, he scored two goals,' said Pochettino.

'He is young, can improve more and now it is Roy's decision.

'I don't know if (he deserves a call-up). Roy needs to decide whether this it time to pick him or not.

'I think that today was a great game, a great performance. We showed character, I am very pleased for our players.'

Alexandre Lacazette, who has been linked with a summer move to England, follows closely behind Kane and Neymar, having scored 25 goals for French outfit Lyon.

Premier League top scorer Sergio Aguero, Guingamp striker Claudio Beauvue, Juventus ace Carlos Tevez and Atletico Madrid's Mario Mandzukic make up the rest of Europe's deadliest top nine strikers.
