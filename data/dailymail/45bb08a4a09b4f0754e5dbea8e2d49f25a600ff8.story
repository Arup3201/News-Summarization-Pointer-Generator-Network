A man convicted of the thrill killing of an elderly Melbourne couple has today been jailed for 32 years. 

Thomas Hemming, 21, will serve at least 27 years behind bars for the murders of Robert Adamson, 65, and his wife, Cheryl, 60, at their Murrumbeena home in February this year.

He had held lifelong fantasies about what it would feel like to kill, the Victorian Supreme Court heard. 

At 6am on February 19, Hemming put on black gloves and a black leather jacket, and went to knock on the door of his neighbours Robert and Cheryl Adamson, asking to use their phone.

Once inside he stabbed Mr Adamson in the back and chest multiple times with a 'large and lethal looking knife' he had ordered online, the court heard.

Mrs Adamson picked up a broom and swung it at Hemming before he turned on her.

'No Empathy': Thomas Hemming arrives in the Supreme Court in Melbourne on Friday

Killed for kicks: Robert Adamson, 65, with wife Cheryl, 60 were murdered by Thomas Hemming

'Cheryl Adamson died protecting her husband and then herself,' said Justice Betty King in the Victorian Supreme Court on Friday.

'They were good, decent and caring neighbours and community members.'

Justice King described the murder as a 'thrill kill' and said Hemming's lack of remorse made him an 'exceedingly poor prospect of rehabilitation.'

'You remain incapable of feeling any empathy, sorrow or regret for your fellow human beings,' she said in court. 

Prosecutor Gavin Silbert SC said Hemming had told police he thought it was better to kill an old couple than someone young. 

'He wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone,' Mr Silbert told the pre-sentence hearing on Monday.

Justice King said the Adamson's son and daughter  had experienced anger, grief and bewilderment  that their parents had been killed in their own home.

'It was unfortunate that their son was the person who found the bodies and undoubtedly that will be difficult to ever erase,' she said.

During his police interview Hemming initially denied his involvement in the Adamsons' deaths but has since pleaded guilty to the two murders.

Defence lawyer Damian Sheales said Hemming was a young offender who had lived a narrow existence and had Asperger's syndrome. The court heard he had been up drinking whiskey the night before committing the murders. 

Psychologist Daniel Sullivan said Hemming had a preoccupation with killing. People with Asperger's syndrome are more likely to be victims of violence, than violent offenders, he told the court.

A friend of the Adamsons, Andrew Masters, said the crime is scarier now that he knows there was no real motive.

'There was some suggestion that Asperger's limited his ability to feel for the victims, but I have Asperger's myself and I feel plenty for the victims,' he told reporters outside court.

The court heard Hemming was a former student of De La Salle in Malvern and had difficulty making friends but came from a loving, stable family.
