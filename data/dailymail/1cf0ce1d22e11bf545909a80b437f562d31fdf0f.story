Guilty: Rohan Pershad QC, arriving at Blackfriars Crown Court today, has been convicted of cheating the public revenue after avoiding paying hundreds of thousands of pounds of tax

A high-flying barrister was found guilty yesterday of more than a decade of tax fraud, using the money to buy luxury homes and to privately educate his four children.

Rohan Pershad, 45, could face up to seven years in prison when he is sentenced on February 26 after being convicted of failing to pay nearly £628,000 in VAT over a 12-year period.

He had been working as a Queen’s Counsel, a member of the legal profession’s elite, at London’s 39 Essex Street Chambers, enjoying a gold-plated pay package.

It is headed by Robert Jay, QC, the senior counsel to the Leveson Inquiry on the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.

Pershad, whose income rose from £85,000 in 2001 to £346,000 by 2008, was charging VAT on his fees but failed to pass a penny on to HM Revenue & Customs between June 1999 and September 2011.

The money helped to buy a £1.1million home in Virginia Water, Surrey, and a £490,000 home in Somerset.

Pershad, whose online CV depicts a lawyer with a particular expertise in fraud cases, insisted he was simply ‘extremely poor at paperwork’.

His conviction at Blackfriars Crown Court comes weeks after the Crown Prosecution Service promised a crackdown on middle-class professionals, such as lawyers, who don’t pay their taxes.

Yesterday a statement from 39 Essex Street Chambers said: ‘It is and always has been clear that all members of these Chambers, in common with all other self-employed barristers, are personally responsible to account to, and pay, HMRC for VAT received, and for income tax.’

Prosecutor Andrew Marshall told the court: 'Through all of that time, he was collecting the VAT.

'It’s just that for that period of 12 years, whilst it was being collected in, it wasn’t being accounted for or handed over as VAT.

'It provided him, if you think about it, with a private, tax-free income because VAT was not being paid. This money, it stayed with Mr Pershad.'

Convicted: Pershad, a barrister, stopped paying his own VAT in 1999 - shortly before he moved to the Thirty Nine Essex Street chambers - and then fell off the tax register, meaning he 'disappeared off the VAT radar'

Hearing: Pershad was today found guilty of cheating the public revenue at London's Blackfriars Crown Court after the jury was asked to give a majority verdict following more than nine hours of deliberations

'This is a man that is used to looking at other people’s business and dissecting it and finding fault in it,' he told jurors.

Denial: Pershad denied the charge against him, claiming he believed Thirty Nine Essex Street paid his VAT

Pershad denied the charge against him, claiming he believed Thirty Nine Essex Street paid his VAT.

But his defence - branded 'preposterous' by the prosecution - was rejected by the jury.

Keri Ashworth-Beaumont, specialist prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service Central Fraud Division, said: 'Rohan Pershad QC failed to pay VAT for a period of 12 years, despite charging his clients that VAT.

'As a result, he retained an additional private income of £624,579, which should have been paid to HMRC and the public purse.

'By convicting him today, the jury has concluded that Pershad was acting dishonestly and his failure to pay was not simply an error or mistake.

'He claimed that his chambers had given the impression that payment of his VAT had been taken care of, but the jury clearly rejected that assertion.

Pershad always admitted that he understood the law and the responsibility for meeting his obligations rested on him alone.

'The message is clear; paying tax is not an optional extra in any area of working life and withholding tax dishonestly may lead to prosecution.'

Pershad was called to the bar in 1991 and was made QC in 2011. He was interviewed after HMRC intervened in September that same year.
