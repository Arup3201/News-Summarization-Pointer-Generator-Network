Starting in San Diego, the Spongebob-themed SUV will make its way to exotic locales such as Baltimore, MD, the Mall of America and Chicagoland Speedway, before finally giving it a rest at the Los Angeles Auto Show on December 9, according to the release.Spongebob Squarepants characters will also join in for pictures and awkward high-fives from legions of their adoring fans.

Despite a Toyota VP hardly being able to contain their enthusiasm, he’s quoted in the press release as being ‘pumped and honored,' – reaction to this abomination on wheels has been mixed at best.One person on Twitter thanked the car maker for completing their day, while another called it his ‘own personal hell.’ One Twitter user asked ‘why is this happening?’ And another asked if it meant the end of the world was near.
