Detectives have issued an e-fit of a man they want to speak to after he was apparently seen running away from a footpath where a Saudi student was stabbed to death.

Nahid Almanea, 31, was brutally attacked just over two weeks ago near the University of Essex in Colchester, where she was described as an 'exceptional' English language student who wanted to start a PhD.

Today officers said they want to trace this man seen running up Hewes Close, away from the Salary Brook Trail where 
Ms Almanea died, at 10.56am on June 17 - about 15 minutes after 
she was attacked.

Appeal: Detectives have issued an e-fit of a man seen running away from the footpath where student Nahid Almanea, 33, was stabbed 16 times and left to die. He is described as white and 18 to 25 with medium build

He is described as white and aged 18 to 25 with medium build, dark hair and a distinctive bar piercing in his left eyebrow.

He was wearing a long-sleeved plain hooded top described as 'London bus red' and dark trousers.

In other developments, more than 2,000 students at the university have been given panic alarms after Ms Almanea's murder - which came less than three months after a similar fatal stabbing in a park - in case they are attacked.

Registrar Bryn Morris said: Very understandably, there is anxiety for students and the focus is on catching the perpetrators of these dreadful crimes and bringing them to justice.

'The way police have deployed officers must be applauded - it has been just right.

'It's mainly post-graduates on campus at the moment, but I'm not aware of any students who are not planning to come in.

'In the past two weeks a lot of work has been done to support students.'

Last known footage: Ms Almanea was captured on CCTV (left) on the morning of her murder, which sparked a vast search by police which is still ongoing more than two weeks later. Officers drained three fishing lakes

The man is one of the key potential witnesses who have still not come forward to police.

Police previously said they were keen to trace several other people, include a man who may have been following the student.

One
 was a man spotted walking behind two women, one of them possibly Ms 
Almanea, at around 8.45am on June 13, four days before she was 
murdered.

A second man police wanted to trace was seen on the Salary Brook Trail shortly before Ms Almanea was found, and was wearing a distinctive light brown Italian-style designer jacket.

Chief Inspector Richard Phillibrown, 
Colchester district commander, said: 'We have received excellent support
 throughout this investigation from the whole community.

'We
 appreciate their patience whilst the forensic searches continue. We 
would also urge anyone with information, no matter how small you might 
think, to contact us.'

Police
 say the case bears similarities to the murder of James Attfield, 33, who was
 stabbed 102 times on his arms, hands, back, neck and head, in Colchester's Lower Castle Park on March 29.

Officers do not know if the pair were murdered by the same person, but they are keeping an 'open mind', they said.

Parts of the murder scene finally reopened to the public yesterday after a vast search, which recovered 38 knives and involved draining three lakes.

On the day of her murder Ms Almanea was wearing a dark navy blue full-length Muslim robe, called an Abaya, and a patterned multi-coloured hijab headscarf.

She also had a black bag with orange panels which she was carrying on a shoulder strap.

Since her killing, more than 600 calls have been made to the incident room with more than 300 house-to-house inquiries and 250 stop checks.

Richard Barnard, head of the International Academy at the University of Essex, said Ms Almanea had recently achieved the highest score in her class for a recent test - but was murdered before tutors could tell her the good news.

'She was very focused, always positive and had an inner self-belief,' he said. 'Her quiet determination to succeed, her hard work and her enthusiasm for her studies had really impressed her teachers

'Outside of the class, Nahid was always friendly, considerate and thoughtful with a very polite and courteous manner.'

There are other people who police say were in the area and could have crucial information.

They include a 5ft 7ins white woman, thought to be in her early 20s, with light brown hair, a summer dress and a denim jacket.

Another was a white man who 'looked like a student', aged 19 to 23, with blond hair, a backpack and white headphones.

Another potential student had dark, short hair and light trousers and was using a phone.

Police also want to trace a black man who was wearing a forward-facing cap, a dark blue and yellow striped polo top and a backpack.

Anyone with information should contact the force on 01245 282103 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
