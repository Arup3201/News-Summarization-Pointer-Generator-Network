Britain’s last surviving Dambuster Johnny Johnson has gone into battle to try and win recognition for the men involved in the raid.

Men from the famous Dambuster raid have been given a simple clasp for their heroism, instead of a medal in recognition for their mission striking at the heart of industrial Germany.

Former Squadron Leader Johnson, now 91, is now calling for a proper medal for the aircrews involved.

He told the Telegraph: ‘A medal was produced for the Arctic [convoy] survivors. If a medal is good enough for them it’s good enough for us.

‘We deserve a medal not a clasp.’

Mr Johnson, who flew 50 missions during his 22 years service was the bomb aimer on the night of May 17, 1943, as part of Operation Chastise to cripple the Nazi war effort.

He dropped the bomb on Sorpe dam and was awarded a raft of medals including the Distinguished Flying Medal for his part in the daring 617 Squadron raid.

A portrait in honour of him will be unveiled later this month in London.

Last year Mr Johnson leant his support to a £1million appeal to help maintain a memorial to the men of Bomber Command.

The £7.5million bronze memorial in 
London's Green Park was unveiled by the Queen in June 2012 in tribute to 
the 55,573 men who died while serving in Bomber Command during the 
Second World War.

Almost half of the unit's 125,000 men did not come home while 8,400 were wounded and 10,000 taken prisoner.

Johnny Johnson served as a bomb aimer in
 pilot Joe McCarthy's crew, part of the squadron which was based at RAF 
Scampton in Lincolnshire.

In an interview last year, he 
said: 'The memories are still vivid and it’s ­something that will always
 be with me. I’ve never talked about that night without being asked. I 
wasn’t sure people would be interested.

'I’m
 asked how it feels to be the last British Dambuster. Well, excuse the 
language, I feel bloody lucky. I was in the right crew, in the right 
place at the right time and I feel honoured and privileged to have been 
able to take part.

'But surviving when so many didn’t come back was pretty shattering. There was an awful lot of loss – on both sides.'

 the last living Briton among the airmen, who were made up of volunteers
 and experienced personnel from Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand 
and the United States.

The heroics of that night were immortalised in the 1955 film The Dambusters, starring Richard Todd and Michael Redgrave as Bomber Command head Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris and Barnes Wallis respectively

He retired from the Royal Air Force in 1962 and became a junior school teacher.

He
 and his late wife Gwyn have three children, eight grandchildren and 16 
great-grandchildren from their 62-year marriage. Gwyn, who served as a 
WRAF radio operator, died in 2005.

The squadron was assembled by Wing Commander Guy Gibson with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission.

They
 were not told that they would be bombing the Ruhr Valley until six 
hours before the raid began, following weeks of practice over Peak 
District reservoirs.

On the night of May 16, the 19 
Lancasters carrying 113 crewmen took off in three waves along two 
different routes to bomb the dams.

Gibson attacked first at the Möhne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached.

The
 first wave’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder
 which finally collapsed at 1.52am. Aircraft from the other two waves 
bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact.

 Ldr Johnson's crew had a lucky escape from anti-aircraft gunfire below.
 They shot at a train - and got a blast from a goods train's armament in
 return.

The shot pierced a tyre and blasted 
through the wing and undercarriage before embedding in the roof above 
the navigator's head. It narrowly missed the petrol tanks.

 heroics of that night were immortalised in the 1955 film The 
Dambusters, starring Richard Todd and Michael Redgrave as Bomber Command
 head Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris and Barnes Wallis respectively.

Last year, after a hard fought campaign, Second World War veterans of the Arctic Convoy missions were finally honoured. 

The government had previously refused to provide recognition of the sailors' bravery in keeping supply lines open to the Eastern Front, because the conflict was too long ago.

Thousands of vessels massed in Loch Ewe before embarking on the treacherous 1,600-mile journey past the enemy-held shores of Norway, through the Barents Sea to the frozen wastes of Murmansk and Archangel.

The convoys carried four million tons of cargo including tanks, planes, fuel and food to help the Russia slow Germany's advances on the Eastern front.

More than 66,000 Royal Navy sailors and merchant seamen took part. In total, 87 merchant ships and 18 British warships were sunk.

But the Cold War meant it was politically difficult to give the survivors a medal for assisting the Soviet Union.

When the war ended those on the convoys were awarded the Atlantic Star - even though that was a separate campaign 800 miles away.

But last year Prime Minister David Cameron ordered the Arctic Star medals amid concerns many veterans would die before they were awarded. He admitted he was 'righting a wrong'.
