At least two people have become over-night millionaires after lottery officials confirm that two winning tickets for the $400million Mega Millions jackpot were sold in Maryland and Florida.

The numbers drawn Tuesday night were: 11, 19, 24, 33 and 51 with a Mega Ball of 7.

The jackpot is the sixth-largest lottery prize in U.S. history.

In Maryland, the winning ticket was sold in Charles County. NBC reports the ticket was sold at Lady's Liquors on 6474 Crain Highway in La Plata.

In that case the winning ticket buyer has yet to contact state officials.

In Florida, the winning ticket was sold at a Sunoco convenience store on Merritt Island.

The drawing also had eight $1 million winners.

The tickets with all five matching numbers, plus the multiplier, are entitled to the jackpot which they can redeem in two ways.

The first is through an annuity program with one immediate payment, following by annual payments for the next 29 years that increase 5 per cent with each payment.

The increased payments were designed 
to cover the annual increase in cost of living so that winners 
'lifestyle and purchasing power' would remain the same through their 
lifetime.

The other 
option is to take a one-time lump sum payment. If the ticket holders in 
Maryland and Florida chose that option, they are entitled to 
$223 million.

Even if you don't match all six numbers, 
you can be eligible for prizes up to $1million.

Mega Millions changed its rules in October to help increase jackpots by lowering the odds of winning the top prize.

Mega Millions is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
