David Cameron has spared the blushes of Francois Hollande after agreeing an Anglo-French summit this week will not include spouses.

While Samantha Cameron is often seen at the Prime Minister’s side, Mr Hollande is without a First Lady after revelations he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet.

As the French President’s former First Lady Valerie Trierweiler conducted a high profile tour of India, Downing Street insisted partners are not invited to Friday’s event.

Awkward: Downing Street insisted there would be no role for spouses when David Cameron hosts French President Francois Hollande for a summit this week

Valerie Trierweiler told journalists she doesn't know what she will do now she is no longer France's First Lady - but she has some time to decide

Mr Hollande is due in the UK on Friday for the summit, a week after his split from first Miss Trierweiler was announced formally.

He officially ‘fired’ her on Saturday – signalling the end of her time as  first lady in a curt 18-word statement.

The Paris Match magazine journalist’s charity trip to India will certainly be the last she enjoys with all the trappings of a VIP dignitary.

Mr Hollande has made it clear that he wants her to return to ordinary life, staying away from the Elysee Palace and living in the modest flat they once shared in Paris’s unfashionable 15th arrondissement.

Mr Hollande, who had never married, is now expected to remain a ‘bachelor president’ for a while, while continuing with his relationship with Ms Gayet outside the Elysee.

Ms Gayet has not spoken since the pictures were published of Mr Hollande leaving their Paris love nest on the back of a moped, while using a crash helmet as a poor disguise.

Friends have indicated that she wants financial compensation from the President, who fears that she will turn into a loose cannon who could damage him.

Mr Cameron is hosting the summit at RAF Brize Norton, the air force base in his Oxfordshire constituency.

Energy and defence policy are expected to dominate talks on Friday morning, with senior ministers from both sides of the Channel expected to take part.

Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande will also eat lunch together, but without their other halves.

‘I do not think there is a spouses' programme, no,’ Mr Cameron's official spokesman told reporters.

In June 2010 Mr Cameron and wife Samantha hosted then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni for lunch in 10 Downing Street

Tony and Cherie Blair welcomed French President Jacques Chirac and his wife Bernadette to Downing Street in 2004

Number 10 also confirmed that there would be a summit press conference.

‘There will be an opportunity to ask questions,’ the spokesman said.

French journalists were widely criticised for their failure to grill Mr Hollande about his affair when he gave a press conference in Paris days after details of his trysts emerged.
