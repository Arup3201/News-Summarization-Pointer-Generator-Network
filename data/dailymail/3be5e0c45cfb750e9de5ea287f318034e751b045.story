A Florida woman was arrested Thursday after police say she narrowly avoided driving into a group of children, after which she emerged from her car and relieved herself on the sidewalk.

Keisha Feeney, 23, of Ocala, was taken into custody just before 8pm on a slew of charges, among them disorderly conduct, reckless driving and driving with a license that has been suspended since 2011.

According to police, the woman was speeding at around 7.50pm Thursday when she crossed the railroad tracks and came to a stop outside the Parkside Garden Apartments at 620 Northwest 2nd Street, nearly mowing down several children standing on the sidewalk.

Her arrest report cited by WKMG states that when Miss Feeney got out of her car, she appeared disoriented and proceeded to urinate in the street.

When police arrived on the scene and the 23-year-old motorist was placed in the back of the patrol car, she allegedly attempted to kick out the back window and had to have her legs restrained.

Miss Feeney remained at the Marion County Jail Friday.

As recently as October, Feeney was sentenced to one year and six months of community supervision for making threats.
