Cleared: Lloyd Erp was acquitted after being accused of murdering his wife Lori in a suicide pact. The scars from where he shot himself are visible

A man charged with murdering his wife during a double suicide pact that went wrong has been dramatically acquitted by a jury.

Lloyd Erp has spent more than two years in jail waiting to come to trial over the death of his wife Lori.

The court heard how the couple, from Portland, Oregon, had both signed a suicide note saying they wanted to to die on March 2, 2013.

Mr Erp told the court that his 52-year-old wife shot herself twice in the head in their bedroom, before he took the rifle and tried to kill himself.

He shot himself twice in the head, but survived. 

Police were called and Lori was found in bed. 

Mr Erp was arrested and charged with murder, and during the trial prosecutors claimed a post-mortem examination of Lori's body suggested she had been shot by someone else.

But on Wednesday Mulnomah County jurors cleared him of murder, after deliberating for less than a day.

During the trial, a defence lawyer told jurors the Erps were deeply in love but suffered health problems and addictions to painkillers.

They also faced losing their home because neither of them were in work. 

Mr Erp told the court he still missed his wife terribly, and some days still wants to die, according to a report by OregonLive.

An earlier trial saw the jury reach deadlock - because they could not decide whether Mr Erp had shot and murdered his wife - and a mistrial was declared.

But during the latest court appearance, prosecution lawyer Tom Cleary urged jurors to follow Oregon law, which said that if they believed Mr Erp fired the fatal shots they must find him guilty of murder.

'This is not a Death With Dignity case,' the prosecutor said.

The judge also instructed jurors that Oregon law doesn't define murder as assisting another in committing suicide, such as handing someone a loaded gun.

But state law does define murder as committing the actual killing, the judge said -- actually pulling the trigger even if the person wanted to die.

Dr Christopher Young, deputy state medical examiner, testified that he determined Lori Erp didn't shoot herself but died by someone else's action.

Mr Erp's 52-year-old wife Lori (pictured) was found dead at her home in bed with two shots to her head. Prosecutors alleged Mr Erp had tried to kill her, but he successfully argued that she had shot herself

However defence expert and former medical examiner Dr Michael Propst, said it was unclear whether the woman died by her own hand.

Lawyer for the defence Kasla Rutledge added: 'People who are murdered in their sleep by their husbands don't leave suicide notes.'

The report in OregonLive added that Mr Erp had not been allowed to attend his wife's memorial service.

'This has been two long years that Lloyd has been in custody, waiting to be exonerated,' Ms Rutledge said. 

'He has not been able to grieve. He has not been able to process what happened and his survivor's guilt. And now he gets a chance to do that.'
