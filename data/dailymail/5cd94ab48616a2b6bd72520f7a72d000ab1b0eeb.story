'The Chosen One' is a confident message to have on your boots going into a World Cup final... but it seemed to work for Bastian Schweinsteiger.

The Germany midfielder was bloodied during the game against Argentina, but it was all worth it in the 1-0 extra-time win.

Inscribed on his boots was the intriguing message, as Schweinsteiger mixed a little bit of confidence and a little bit of arrogance.

Heard of the chosen one before this season? A

 ploy didn't go quite to plan, but Schweinsteiger will
have been happy it didn't come back to haunt him in the climax to the tournament

The Maracana dressing room sported many unusual kit choices, varying from ancient shinpads, to a vast selection of boots.
