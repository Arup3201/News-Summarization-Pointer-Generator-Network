A drunk mother hit her elderly boyfriend with her car - breaking his neck - before driving into a nearby lake with their six-month-old baby in the backseat, police have said.

Latonya Kirven and her baby were only saved when a group of heroic teenagers who witnessed the incident on Monday jumped into the water at Offatts Bayou, Texas.

When the 31-year-old mother was pulled from the water, Galveston police arrested her and charged her with driving while intoxicated with a child and assault with a deadly weapon.

Authorities said the incident started when Kirven and her 70-year-old boyfriend, Matt Grey, began fighting and she jumped into her car and hit him, leaving him in critical condition in hospital.

She then purposefully drove into the bayou with her child strapped in the back, police said.

Four teenagers, Nathan Reyna, Tyler Arcizo, Byron Bledsoe and Matt Guzman, were fishing nearby when they saw the car plunge into the water and begin sinking, KHOU11 reported.

As the vehicle began turning over, the youngsters realized that there was a baby inside.

They caught the incident on a cell phone camera. In the footage, one of the boys can be heard shouting: 'She has a baby! She has a baby!'

Scrap: She pushed him away as he reaches to save her child. She then swam away and took off her clothes

Arcizo jumped into the water to help the mother and her baby, but the footage shows her pushing the young man away from her.

'I
 was struggling with her to get the baby from her,' Arcizo told KHOU11. 'She 
wouldn't give him up. She kept pulling him from me and putting him under
 water.'

After the boys took the baby to the shore, Kirven started swimming around and taking her clothes off.

Arcizo, who lost his keys and his wallet during the rescue, added: 'She was acting crazy. She's in jail. That's where she needs to be, honestly.'

She was eventually pulled out of the water and neither mother or child suffered any injuries.

Arrested: Police said Kirven, pictured above, was drunk while a friend said she had started taking drugs

Galvestonâ€™s Police Chief Henry Porretto called the boys' actions 'truly heroic'.

'I would like to commend those bystanders who risked their own safety to enter the water to rescue the child and attempt to rescue the driver,' he said at a press conference. 'Their actions were truly heroic.'

Police have not yet said what led to the fight, but Grey's granddaughter said she believes Kirven was on drugs at the time of the incident.

Kirven is being held on $160,000 bond.
