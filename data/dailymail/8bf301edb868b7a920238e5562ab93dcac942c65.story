The Uber executive who suggested hiring researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize his company has fallen into a bitter row with his landlord over his $9,500-a-month apartment in San Francisco, it has been revealed.

Emil Michael, who is senior vice president for business at the taxi firm, accused tech industry lawyer John Danforth of harassment,  and racism claiming the tech industry lawyer 'violated [his] human rights' by performing unnecessary renovations to the flat.

He became so aggrieved by the landlords alleged intrusions that he even took his complaint to San Francisco's Superior Court and applied for a restraining order - one usually reserved for stalkers and abusive partners.

'I am under constant emotional duress that a stranger can enter my apartment without notice requiring me to defend myself posing constant fear and a dangerous situation,' Michael wrote, according to court papers seen by BuzzFeed News.

He added: 'Also, the landlord is invading my privacy and ruining my relationship with my significant other.' 

Danforth responded by branding Michael's claims 'demonstrably false' before the judge threw the case out of court.

According to BuzzFeed, the dispute between Michael and his landlord centers on a '2,000 square foot Pacific Heights condo overlooking Alta Plaza Park, for which Michael signed a $9,500 lease in June 2012 (the rent has since been raised to $13,335).' 

The website goes on: 'The three bedroom, two bathroom condo was renovated in 2008 and boasts luxury finishes, a parking space, a balcony, and access to a landscaped private garden complete with a remote-control hot tub.'

The dispute allegedly began in June last year when Danforth entered the property to repair a bathroom and discovered his tenant had painter a wall without permission. When he then went onto the balcony to inspect repairs made to the hot tub.

Two months later, Michael confronted a female gardener with a baseball bat in the belief she was an intruder, before writing an email to Danforth stating: 'You provided no notice for this…If this happens again, I will be forced to call the police.' 

He later threatened to reveal Danforth's perceived transgressions to his 'tens of thousands of social media followers'. 

On September 27 2013 the two men met face to face in court in a hearing overseen by judge, Donald J. Sullivan.

Michael said he had suffered 'immense stress', adding: 'I am entitled to the sanctity of my own home.'

Danforth responded by denying that anybody had regularly entered the apartment and that Michael had lied under oath. The judge dismissed the case with prejudice.

'Having listened to all of the evidence, I'm finding that this is a borderline frivolous case,' he said, according to the court transcript. 'It doesn't even come close to meeting the statutory standards of by clear and convincing evidence.'  

It did not end there.

A furious email exchange ensued. 

'Parts of their correspondence were available in public documents filed with the superior court and rent board,' said BuzzFeed, 'while others were provided to BuzzFeed News by Danforth.'

In one, Michael wrote: 'I am so glad that you denied that I have sole and exclusive use of the property. It is your typical harassment, retaliation, racist activity that you use with me.'

He also threatened to have him arrested after taking the matter to 'my friend the Chief of Police of SF'.

A spokesperson for the SFPD said in an email that the 'chief himself will not be getting involved in any civil disputes or civil investigation.'

In March Michael sent Danforth an email saying: 'I was hoping you were not still dealing with your mental health issues. But, I guess given that you are a patent troll and a slumlord, you cannot help yourself.' 

Target: It comes after he reportedly proposed looking into journalists' 'personal lives' and 'families' while at a private dinner in New York He was speaking with specific reference to Sarah Lacy (left), editor of PandoDaily, who recently wrote about deleting her Uber app (right) after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in France

Danforth responded by suggesting Michael should start looking for a new apartment, to which Michael replied: 'I can stay in the apartment as long as I want, a*****e. Regardless, this is good evidence of your intent, racist a*****e.'

The acerbic email exchanges came after Michael was forced into a grovelling apology last month for suggesting a plan to spend $1million on a team of researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize his company.

Michael, who made the remarks at a private dinner in Manhattan, said he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them.

The sinister scheme was targeted at a particular Silicon Valley female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public.

A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely.

Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them.

'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' 

The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints.

Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, it is claimed

And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards.

According to Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. 

The dinner party in question was hosted by Ian Osborne, ex-adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and consultant for Uber

Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage.

Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly'

In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed.

The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said.

Michael was especially focused on Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn't respect us or prioritize our safety.'

He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers.

He said Lacy should be held 'personally responsible' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app, and are then sexually assaulted, it is reported

Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities'

And in reference to a specific claim about Lacy's personal life, he said Uber's dirt-diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others, adding: 'Nobody would know it was us.'

After being confronted about his comments, Michael, who has been at Uber for more than a year and was previously described as a 'top deal guy' by founder Travis Kalanick, later apologized

In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor Uber's views.

'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company's views or approach,' he said.

'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.'  

At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers.

An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'.

The event at Waverly Inn was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington.
