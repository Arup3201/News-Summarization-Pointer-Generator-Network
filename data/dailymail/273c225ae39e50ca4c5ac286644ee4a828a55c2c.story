It is the most expensive film ever to come out of China and was conceived as a spectacular epic to rival Avatar.

But instead of the Â£130million masterpiece its makers intended, it seems that Empires Of The Deep is destined to be filed alongside other big-budget turkeys such as Battlefield Earth and John Carter.

The 3D mermaid movie's U.S. trailer premiered this week and has received a scathing response from critics, who poured scorn on its 'woefully' amateur special effects.

'Woeful': The U.S. trailer of Empires Of The Deep has received a scathing response from critics

Bond girl Olga Kurylenko stars in the film after she replaced Monica Bellucci, who quit early in the production

Amateur: The film's U.S. trailer premiered this week and was immediately set upon by critics, who poured scorn on its 'woeful' special effects

Kristy Puchko, writing on CinemaBlend.com, commented that its 'live action scenes seem as low-budget as TV's Xena: Warrior Princess, and computer graphics that look like a video game from the early 2000s.'

Jack Cunliffe at TheFilmStage.com wrote: 'After some quick banter with actual humans (or possibly mermaids), we get a minute onslaught of some of the worst, potentially insanely entertaining footage of this disaster.'

Lead role: Kurylenko at the London premiere of her Bond movie Quantum Of Solace in 2008

Empires Of The Deep, which its makers describe as 'an unlikely love story between a young human and a mermaid... set in a mythical world', has had a troubled production history.

Work on the film, a Chinese-American co-production, began three years ago after the project was bankrolled by Chinese billionaire Jon Jiang, who also wrote the script.

The lead role originally went to Italian actress Monica Bellucci, only for her to pull out and be replaced by Bond girl Olga Kurylenko.

Similar problems dogged finding a suitable director. The Empire Strikes Back's Irvin Kershner, who died in 2010, was at one point linked to the project as was Catwoman director Pitof.

But even Pitof, who has only made one TV movie since his infamous 2004 feline flop, couldn't be persuaded to stick around.

Instead, Michael French, who directed 2008's low budget Heart Of The Dragon, saw the film through to competition.

Referring to this difficult gestation period, website Twitch headlined its scathing article: 'Three years and $130million later, all we get is Olga Kurylenko with a shell on her head'.

Film blog Indiewire even goes as far as to suggest the film will never see a U.S. release, at least not in cinemas.

It said: 'With all the money spent, this looks cheap and woefully put together, with the talented Kurylenko left to flounder in cast of nobodies in a silly underseas adventure, with truly shoddy special effects.

'We'll bet money this never sees a proper Stateside release because we can't imagine anyone is going to pay to distribute this thing.'

IMDB observed that it is 'a movie that looks like crappy underwater Avatar or a gritty live-action remake of The Little Mermaid'.
