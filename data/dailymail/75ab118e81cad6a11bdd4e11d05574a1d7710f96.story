Groningen's coach Erwin van de Looi had predicted a tight, closely-matched contest. He proved a sound and decent judge.

With matching 4-5-1 formations, Aberdeen and their Dutch league opponents embarked on a game of North Sea chess. At home next week, the Eredivisie team will surely find another gear. But there was little here to alter the accuracy of van do Looi’s assessment.

Despite some strong play – particularly in the first half – Aberdeen couldn’t get the goal their chances merited. Yet a scoreless first leg is no disaster. Critically, they didn’t concede despite substitute Dino Islamovic coming within inches of scoring three minutes from time.

Groningen left the Granite City the more content team. Yet both coaches were united in their view afterwards. This contest will go all the way.

Home advantage pushed Aberdeen to some neat attacking football. On nights like this, in front of a 16,523 crowd, Pittodrie is a good place to be.

Groningen were a step up from Daugava Riga, the Latvians dismissed on an 8-0 aggregate. Yet in a strong opening half hour the Dons did enough here to merit a narrow advantage for the second game.

It had seemed Peter Pawlett might make the difference. In the early stages he had right-back Hans Hatebor in a state of alarm with his pace, the full back eventually earning a second-half booking for one foul too many.

Groningen’s languid passing game was geared towards counter-attacking containment.  But Aberdeen weren’t having it. They harried and probed, pressed and pushed, and Pawlett didn’t look like a player willing to be constrained by anybody.

He almost broke the stalemate in nine minutes, showing great endeavour to simply collect the ball and go past Johan Kappelof, gaining a yard before striking a left foot shot parried outwards by keeper Sergio Padt. The ball almost fell perfectly for Adam Rooney, seeking his 15th goal in 21 appearances, but was thumped out of play for a corner.

Pawlett’s direct play posed the visitors more problems in 24 minutes when he collected a pass from Niall McGinn and took a superb first touch, holding the ball long enough for the Northern Irishman to advance into the area.

McGinn tried to dink the return pass over Padt, but the keeper made himself big and saved. Aberdeen were growing into this game, too.

Perhaps their one frustration was the need to play Jonny Hayes at left-back. Ostensibly a winger, his attacking instincts were bound to out eventually and – not the tallest of players – he got up to head a Willo Flood cross towards goal in 26 minutes. Padt collected it unconvincingly.

Yet Aberdeen could take heart from the fact his opposite number Jamie Langfield had nothing to do until four minutes from half-time. Even then it was Mark Reynolds who almost turned Hatebor’s overlapping cross into his own goal.

Langfield got down to stop it and the Dons defence froze as Groningen’s No9 Danny Hoesen reacted first to strike the ball from the most acute angle. It ran across the face of the goal and Aberdeen cleared their lines. For the first time in ages you could hear the Dutch contingent of 600 fans.

When Aberdeen’s notoriously quiet home support – out in fine numbers – are making all the racket it’s a sign a game is going well. Yet the problem remained at half-time of how to take an advantage to Holland next week, however narrow. All whilst resisting a damaging away goal on the counter.

Groningen provoked another roar from their support in 62 minutes, Rasmus Lindgren’s rasping low drive forcing Langfield to dive full length to his right and turn away.

In Pawlett and Hayes, Aberdeen had the game’s most dangerous attackers on the left side. In the centre, Rooney was having a less effective night.

McInnes made the big call of removing his hat-trick hero from the last round and throwing on David Goodwillie for the last 20 minutes.

But the former Scotland striker had little to feed off  - and Groningen subs Jarchinio Antonia and Islamovic almost combined to turn the ball past Langfield with moments to go. For Aberdeen that would have been harsh. At half-time, this tie is finely poised.
