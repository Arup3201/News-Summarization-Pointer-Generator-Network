It was meant to be a night of triumph, another step towards the realisation of Brazil's ultimate dream. 

But this World Cup semi-final quickly turned into a living nightmare as irresistible Germany ripped the hosts apart before a disbelieving crowd in Belo Horizonte.

And one of the main scapegoats for this humiliation is sure to be Fred, the centre forward who was absent in body and mind throughout, touching the ball simply to get the play restarted after each crushing blow. 

Here's the clockwatch of Fred's night of abject misery.

VIDEO Scroll down for Fred vs Jo - highlights

Stuff of nightmares: Brazil striker Fred was absolutely anonymous as his team were thrashed by Germany in the World Cup semi-final

Ineffective: Fred failed to make any impression on proceedings in Belo Horizonte whatsoever as germany dominated

Out-muscled: Fred is easily pushed off the ball by German defender Mats Hummels

7.30pm The Brazil squad arrive by coach at the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte as a nation holds its collective breath. Fred, like all of his team-mates, wear baseball caps with a 'Forca Neymar' slogan printed on them as they stroll to the dressing room. Ah yes, Neymar. Anybody mentioned him lately?

The absence of the Selecao's talisman piles even more pressure on Fluminense's forward Fred, who has found the net just the once in the World Cup so far - against Cameroon in the third group match.

7.45pm Despite his record being much-maligned, Fred is named in Luiz Felipe Scolari's starting line-up. With the absence of Neymar, there was little alternative, with Fred the spearhead of an attacking quartet with Bernard, Oscar and Hulk behind him.

8.15pm The stadium, a picturesque sea of yellow, explodes as the Brazilian players come out for their warm-up. There is a deafening roar of 'Brasil, Brasil!' from those exceedingly fortunate fans inside the ground.

Time to deliver: Fred goes through his warm-up routine at the Estadio Mineirao ahead of the semi-final showdown

Steely focus: Fred walks out of the tunnel ahead of the match

Ready for action: The Brazil team line-up for the cameras ahead of kick-off, holding up a No 10 shirt in tribute to their injured talisman, Neymar

8.55pm 200 million people are united as the Brazilian team line up for the national anthem, sung in stirring 'a cappella' style as it reaches a deafening crescendo. Fred, third from the end of the line, belts it out like the rest of his team-mates. It is time for him to deliver.

5min Brazil have started the match with positive intent, bossing the possession and enjoying the first chance when Marcelo fires wide. Fred, however, is struggling to find space inside the German box and doesn't touch the ball in the opening five minutes.

8min Fred finally enters the action, chesting down a lovely flighted ball from the right on the edge of the area, but he's unable to thread it through to the onrushing Oscar.

11min GOAL - Brazil 0-1 Germany: Awful defending from Brazil as a corner reaches Thomas Muller totally unmarked in the box. He has all the time in the world to cushion the ball past Julio Cesar. That is the fifth goal Germany have scored from a set-piece at this tournament and shows that Brazil clearly haven't done their homework.

Early touch: Fred controls the ball and steers it away from Thomas Muller during the opening few moments

Squaring up: Fred has a word with German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer

16min Maicon advances well down the right and attempts to swing in a cross to Fred, who has found a little bit of room. Frustratingly for the Brazil No 9, it's blocked by a German defender and the danger passes.

22min GOAL - Brazil 0-2 Germany: An absolute disaster for Brazil! Miroslav Klose with a record-breaking goal as he becomes the all-time leading goalscorer in the World Cup, overtaking the Brazilian great Ronaldo. It's all too simple as Klose pounces on a loose ball inside the box and finishes on the rebound after his initial effort is saved by Cesar.

24min GOAL - Brazil 0-3 Germany: From bad to worse... Philipp Lahm's low pass across the 18-yard box evades Muller but simply runs through to Toni Kroos to drill the ball into the bottom corner first-time with his left foot.

Dejection: Fred and Oscar prepare to kick off yet again as Germany continue their glorious first-half goal rush

26min GOAL - Brazil 0-4 Germany: Complete and utter silence from those in yellow shirts as Germany add a fourth - their third goal in three minutes. Sami Khedira easily wins the ball in midfield and squares for Kroos to score again.

The camera pans to Fred, stood about 80 yards away. Seldom has a player looked so utterly, utterly helpless.

29min GOAL - Brazil 0-5 Germany: And another! Brazil's defence has completely capitulated, this is embarrassing. Ozil practically walks through the heart of the Brazil defence and tucks the ball back to Khedira to find the bottom corner.

Floored: Fred trips over the challenge of Germany's Mats Hummels as Brazil struggle to make any impression going forward

44min Brazil finally get their act together and launch what could be a cohesive attack. But when the ball forward comes, it just goes through Fred, who seems to be afraid of touching it. He pleads for a foul but the referee is having none of it.

There are boos and jeers from the crowd. Perhaps at the decision, more likely at the impotent player.

HALF-TIME: Brazil go back to the dressing room trailing 5-0. The crowd are in tears, the dream dying in front of their eyes. Fred has touched the ball no more than a handful of times, he is absolutely hopeless and it would be a surprise to see him re-emerge for the second period.

Embarrassing: Fred's heat map at half-time shows that he spent more time with the ball kicking off in the centre circle than anywhere else on the pitch

Head's up: Fred beats a static Philipp Lahm to the ball in the air

46min Incredibly, despite being completely anonymous for the whole first-half, Fred has stayed on. Hulk and Fernandinho are sacrificed, with Ramires and Paulinho coming on.

48min Fred is the target for a long ball forward from deep and he falls over under the slightest contact from Per Mertesacker. It's a con trick to try and win a penalty but the referee isn't interested and waves play on as Fred rolls around on the floor.

50min Fred's best involvement in the match so far... it's only taken 50 minutes. He initially controls the ball away from goal on the edge of the box but then finds some space and slips it through to Ramires, whose low cross is palmed away well by Neuer.

58min At last, a shot at goal by Fred. It comes to him about 20 yards from goal and the best he can manage is a tame daisy-cutter that is easily picked up by Neuer. The crowd bellows in disgust.

Lightweight: Fred falls under slight pressure from Per Mertesacker

Frustration: Fred reacts with dismay as yet another Brazilian attack breaks down

66min Fred has a quick touch about 30 yards from goal. It is greeted with the kind of reception from the crowd that suggests he might have to go into hiding for some time.

69min GOAL! Brazil 0-6 Germany: Yet more shambolic defending as Brazil have no answer to Germany's one-touch passing. Lahm crosses low from the right and substitute Andre Schurrle sweeps it in from close range.

70min SUBBED OFF - That's it, Fred is finally put out of his misery as Scolari hooks him off for Willian with 20 minutes left. It's fair to say that few inside the ground, or in Brazil as a whole, are too disappointed with that decision.

Out of his misery: Fred was substituted off for Willian with 20 minutes remaining

Poor: Fred's final heat map in the match

Sympathy: Joey Barton was at least on Fred's side

VIDEO Fred vs Jo - highlights

71min - Fred is shown on the big screen sat on the bench nursing a bottle of Powerade and catching his breath. Jeers once again ring around the stadium!

79min - GOAL! Brazil 0-7 Germany: Not much Fred can do now, but Schurrle adds a magnificent seventh by rifling the ball into the roof of the net.

90min - GOAL! Brazil 1-7 Germany: Not a great deal of consolation but Oscar skips through a tired German defence to fire home in stoppage time.

FULL-TIME: Brazil 1-7 Germany - It's safe to say no one saw that coming. One of the biggest humiliations in World Cup history. And Fred's performance just about summed it up for Brazil.
