Tory activists are all swivel-eyed loons, according to a member of David Cameron’s inner circle.

The senior figure was responding to comments by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond who suggested the Prime Minister’s proposals to legalise gay marriage had upset vast numbers of people.

Some Conservatives believe that Right-winger Mr Hammond is positioning himself for a leadership bid.

However, the senior Tory said Mr Cameron was unconcerned by the prospect
of further rebellions when the legislation returns to the Commons on 
Monday.

‘It’s fine – there’s really no problem,’ he said. ‘The MPs just have to 
do it because the associations tell them to do it, and the associations 
are all mad, swivel-eyed loons.’

The comment by Mr Cameron’s close friend is a further sign of the 
divisions the gay marriage proposals are causing within the Conservative
Party and will outrage grass-roots supporters.

Mr Hammond told the BBC’s Question Time on Thursday that the plans had caused unnecessary offence to millions of voters.

The introduction of civil partnerships in 2005 had already ended the 
‘real disadvantage’ that had faced  gay couples, he said. ‘This change 
does redefine marriage – for millions and millions of people who are 
married, the meaning of marriage changes.

‘There is a real sense of anger among many people who are married that 
any government thinks it has the ability to change the definition of an 
institution like marriage. I have never felt this is what we should be 
focusing on.’

Aides to Mr Hammond pointed out that Tory MPs have a free vote on gay 
marriage, and said he was only restating his long-standing opposition to
the legislation.

A source close to Mr Hammond said: ‘The Defence Secretary is a loyalist 
who totally supports the Prime Minister’s stance on Europe and is 
working hard to find efficiency savings to help the Chancellor. His 
stance on gay marriage is well known and is not new.’

Many Tory MPs believe Mr Hammond – once seen as the ultimate loyalist – 
is trying to raise his profile to position himself for a potential 
leadership bid.

A senior Conservative source said there was a ‘pattern of behaviour’ 
emerging, following Mr Hammond’s outspoken opposition to defence cuts 
and his revelation that he would vote to leave the EU.

‘Why does he feel the need to keep speaking out in such strong terms? 
The vast majority of the public support gay marriage, so you have to 
wonder if his intended audience is Tory activists,’ the source added.

Tory MP Peter Bone, a leading opponent of gay marriage, welcomed Mr 
Hammond’s intervention, saying: ‘The Defence Secretary is completely 
right. There is no mandate for this and most members of the Conservative
Party are completely opposed to it.’

Mr Cameron is braced for a bruising week on the issue, with a string of Commons votes expected on Monday and Tuesday.

One senior Tory joked: ‘This week we had Europe, next week we’ve got gay marriage – it’s all going very well.’

Rebels will try to force Mr Cameron to hold a referendum on gay marriage
before it becomes law. They argue he has no mandate for the change as 
it was not in either the Tory or Lib Dem manifestos.

Rebels are also plotting to side with Labour to push through a change 
that would allow civil partnerships for heterosexual couples. Ministers 
oppose the change, fearing it could encourage cohabiting couples to take
advantage of the inheritance and pension rights associated with civil 
partnerships.

On Thursday, Equality Minister Maria Miller unveiled plans for a review 
on the issue, but it would not take place until five years  after gay 
marriage is introduced and was dismissed as inadequate by critics.

Crossbench peer Lord Dear announced he will table a motion opposing the 
second reading of the Bill in the Lords on June 3. He said it was right 
for the Lords to reject a Bill if it feels the executive is ‘clearly 
acting with no democratic mandate and without regard to the proper 
constitutional processes’.
