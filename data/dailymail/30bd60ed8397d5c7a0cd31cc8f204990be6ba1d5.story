Fans of the new BBC series Wolf Hall, which is based on the rise of Thomas Cromwell from lowly blacksmith's son to Henry VIII's chief minister, have been drooling over the beautiful gowns, shining jewels and awe-inspiring architecture of Tudor times.

But don't be fooled by the glamour - life in Tudor times  was tough for women (even if you weren't one of Henry's wives on her way out of favour).

During the 16th century, it was illegal for women to take on many jobs, they were considered the property of men and it was considered reasonable for a husband to beat his wife.

On top of this, education was considered unnecessary for girls, meaning women were often illiterate for most of their lives. 

Women's main role in society was giving birth, which was an extremely dangerous process in the 1500s and often resulted in death.  

Even small things like getting dressed in the morning was an arduous task, with layers and layers of clothing needed to conform to social standards. 

And after jumping through all of these hoops, women were given little thanks, with their male counterparts seeing them as evil temptresses who had led to the fall of man.

FEMAIL's guide to life for women during the reign of Henry VIII:

Anne Boleyn (played by Claire Foy) was one of England's most powerful women after marrying Henry VIII (above, Damian Lewis) but she was still beholden to him and the men in her family

Tudor sex 

Sex in Tudor times wasn't supposed to be fun, especially for women. 

The church dictated many of the rules of the time - they said that sex was solely for procreation purposes and only ever between husband and wife. 

Not only that, but missionary sex was the only position allowed, because other styles were thought to let the devil into the bedroom and lead to a deformed child.

According to historians, a married couple were also forbidden from having sex on Tuesdays, Fridays, Sundays and during Lent. 

It wasn't all bad though, there was a movement that declared a woman needed to ejaculate too in order for conception to be successful during sex, so emphasis was placed on women being able to orgasm. 

However, even where orgasms were involved, women were not allowed to admit to gaining any pleasure from it.  

Unsurprisingly, contraception wasn't easy during the 16th century, both because of laws and a lack of any scientific knowledge. 

Although birth control was illegal, there were several methods used to stop pregnancy. 

According to the historical novelist Elizabeth Fremantle, wealthy men used condoms made from lamb's gut, while women would insert either vinegar-soaked wool or pieces of wood into their vagina as a Medieval-style diaphragm.  

Katherine Of Aragon (played by Joanne Whalley) had very few rights after Henry VIII divorced her

Women's rights 

In Tudor times, women had no legal rights and the law was used by men to limit all aspects of their freedom. 

It was illegal for women to have professional jobs in the law or teaching, or as doctors, which had the added effect of making them seem like a financial burden on a family.

In the 16th century, women were owned by their father until they were married, when they then became the property of their husband. 

While they could inherit property, it was immediately passed over to their husbands if they married.  

Very few women would have rallied against any of these restrictions as they were taught from a very young age that men were the superior sex. 

The only women who were seen of any use to the world were those who had given birth or were pregnant, as that was considered their only function in life.  

Anne's sister Mary (played by Charity Wakefield) was badly used by the men in her family, who were rumoured to have offered her to the king to keep him entertained  while her sister was pregnant

According to the historian Elizabeth Fremantle, men were also legally allowed to beat their wives. 

She told Express.co.uk: 'If a husband disliked his wife’s behaviour he was permitted to beat her with a stick no broader than his thumb but not so violently as to kill her. 

'If a wife was deemed a nag she might be paraded about in public wearing an iron bridle, complete with a tongue-piece, to make speech impossible and humiliation certain.'   

Education

As women weren't allowed jobs, there was little need for a girl to be educated at school, which meant they were often illiterate for their whole lives. 

Poor girls were usually put to use around the house doing menial chores from a very young age, but some richer families would hire a governess to teach skills that were considered feminine, like embroidery.

In contrast, boys would be taught academic subjects like reading, writing and maths. 

Anne Boleyn was unusual in that she was well educated and spoke French fluently as well as English

Childbirth

Giving birth was extremely dangerous in the 16th century, because of a lack of modern medicine and sterilised equipment. 

Women often died during labour from complications that, today, would be easily overcome. One of the most common was puerperal fever, a septic infection that killed both Jane Seymour and Katherine Parr - two of Henry's wives.

As well as being dangerous, childbirth was also extremely painful because pain relief was illegal. 

According to the historian Amy Licence, who wrote In Bed With The Tudors, one midwife was actually burned for using opium to help ease the pain of labours in 1591.  

Dark blue and black were both colours worn by very rich men and women in the 16th century 

Clothing  

Getting dressed was an arduous affair in Tudor times. 

Rich women wore several layers of ruffs, skirts and large amounts of padding under their gowns to achieve the fashionable boxy silhouette of the time.  

Poorer women wore much simpler linen dresses with short sleeves. 

Every woman wore their hair tied up under a cap. 

While the Tudors were very relaxed about their bathing habits, their attitudes to cleanliness in their clothing was very different. 

Whether rich or poor, every man and woman wore clean linens every day and the upper classes would sometimes change up to several times a day.  

The rich didn't just restrict themselves to linen either - new trade with Europe had opened up vast new areas of fashion, with different dyes and materials including silk, taffeta and damasks. 

Married women hid their hair under a veil or cap, but the queen could wear it loose as she wore a crown

But while there were plenty of new fabric colours to choose from, certain parts of society were only allowed to wear certain shades. 

New laws were passed during the Tudor era that dictated what colour you could wear according to your class, so that it was clear how important you were.

Purple was solely for royalty, black for extremely wealthy men and women, while yellow, russet and green was worn by the lower classes. 

For all these different restrictions on clothing, the one thing the Tudor's weren't fussy about was underwear - women wore no pants, so they could easily go to the toilet. 

Women who were not married were allowed to wear their hair loose, but as soon as you were married, it had to be tied away under a hood. 

The queen would occasionally be allowed to wear her hair loose because she wore a crown.   

Life was tough for poor women as they were expected to run the entire household with no thanks

Housework 

Women in Tudor times were extremely busy around the house. 

The basic chores that still apply for adults today, including cooking, washing clothes, cleaning and accounts were far more difficult without modern technology.

But also, they were tasked with baking bread and brewing beer, as well as preserving fruits, pickling vegetables and curing meats because of the lack of refrigeration that keeps food from going off. 

She was also responsible for making soap and candles, spinning wool and linen and growing vegetables and herbs.
