A serial thief has been sent to prison after clocking up her 182nd criminal conviction.

Despite having been given repeated chances to keep out of trouble, Claire MacGarva has persistently re-offended.

The 32-year-old even embarked on a crime spree just two weeks after she was spared prison, stealing a computer and raiding high street shops for more than £400 worth of goods.

Repeat offender: Serial thief Claire MacGarva, 32, has been jailed for two years at Newcastle Crown Court after clocking up her 182nd criminal conviction

However, tonight MacGarva was starting a two year prison term after Judge James Goss QC told the repeat offender she had run out of chances.

'Every effort has been made by the police, your supervising probation officer and by me to stop you committing crime but regrettably we have failed in our efforts,' said Judge Goss, sitting at Newcastle Crown Court.

The court heard that when MacGarva went on her latest shoplifting spree she had been the subject of a drug rehabilitation order, conditional discharge, supervision and a suspended sentence.

Judge Goss was also told that MacGarva has had continued efforts from agencies attempting to help her turn her back on a life of crime, but without success.

The long-term heroin addict had been given a suspended jail term last September but just two weeks later stole a laptop during a burglary at the Sunderland Museum.

Four days after that she stole £12 worth of deodorant from Poundland and £53 of protein products from Holland and Barratt in the city.

On November 29 she then stole DVDs and watches worth £311 from Argos and on January 4 of this year was collared taking £35 worth of groceries from the Co-op in Shiney Row, Tyne and Wear.

MacGarva, of Mowbray Road, Sunderland, admitted theft and burglary charges in relation to the offences.

She also admitted thefts of £300 worth of food from the Co-op in Houghton le Spring, £26 worth of food from Iceland and televisions worth £396 from Asda - all committed last summer, before she was given the suspended sentence in September.

Judge Goss told her: 'You have demonstrated you are unwilling or unable to stop offending.

'You were warned by me at a previous court hearing a substantial custodial sentence is inevitable.

'Continue and you will end up spending years and years in prison.'

Ian Hudson, defending, said: 'Heroin is the catalyst for all her offending.

'She has to pay the price today.'
