A British man has been shot dead by muggers who stole his camera in one of central America's most violent cities.

The man, named locally as Omer Kaya, 33, collapsed after being shot in the neck during the violent robbery in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula.

Police were last night hunting a woman and two men said to have pursued him when he left a taxi, before attacking Mr Kaya while he was reportedly taking photographs.

Murdered: Omer Kaya, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was shot during a confrontation with thieves in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula

Travelling: Mr Kaya is thought to have been travelling across Central America and South America having left at the beginning of January

The businessman, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was due to leave the country on Friday, before celebrating his birthday on Sunday.

Mr Kayaâ€™s was a director of a property management company based in Leigh-on-Sea.

His business partner Fatma Oksuzer said did not know he had traveled to Honduras, adding: 'Omer was a very friendly guy, soft and well-mannered. This is awful.'

He is thought to have handed over his camera but refused to give the gang a rucksack containing his valuables.

A bag found nearby contained a mobile phone, two more cameras, cash and credit cards, an iPad and a pair of swimming goggles.

Pictures in local newspapers showed him lying barefoot on the ground next to a bloodied blanket by a police tape in a pair of white trousers, T-shirt and sunglasses.

Detectives also found an air ticket among his personal belongings, while a pair of flipflops was also found nearby.

My Kaya, whose family are from Turkey, is understood to have been travelling through South and Central America for a month, having left at the beginning of January.

The fatal attack happened around 11am local time on Tuesday in San Pedro Sula's residential Trejo neighbourhood.

San Pedro Sula, in the north of the country, is often cited as the country's most dangerous city.

Violent: the city is regarded as one of the most dangerous in Honduras, a country with the world's highest murder rate with 87 killings per 100,000 people, according to the United Nations

Honduras, with a a murder rate around 20 times that of the United States, is among the most dangerous countries on earth.

Witnesses have told police Mr Kaya, 
who is thought to have been alone, was attacked by a woman and two men 
spotted following him on foot after getting out of a taxi.

A post-mortem showed he died from a bullet wound to his neck.

A 32mm spent cartridge found at the scene was being examined by police last night along with CCTV footage taken from a house near to the spot where Mr Kaya was murdered.

Police chief Leonel Sauceda said: 'It appears Mr Kaya was shot while putting up a fight.'

Violent gangs such as the Mara Salvatrucha, created in the 1980s among central American-born inmates in Californian prisons, operate with impunity.

Drug trafficking is the main source of its violence and local authorities have admitted they lack the infrastructure and resources to cope.

Mexican and Colombian drug cartels have expanded their operations the country, which now has the world's highest murder rate with 87 killings per 100,000 people according to the United Nations.

Police believe Mr Omer may have been on a day trip to the city because they have found no listing for him at any of the local hotels.

Travel guide Lonely Planet says: 'Travellers tend to see San Pedro as a necessary evil.

'Most international flights land here because the city lies right Honduras' top destinations, Copan Ruinas and the Bay Islands.

'You wouldn't be alone in trying to get in and out of San Pedro as quickly as possible.'

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it had been made aware of the death.

The spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Honduras and stand ready to provide consular assistance.'

Good friend Mahmut Guler, 32, from Leigh-on-Sea, said: 'Omer was a great friend and a true gentleman. He was the nicest guy you could ever meet and would never argue with anyone.

'I am still in shock and can't believe this has happened. He only contacted me on Friday to say happy birthday and he was telling me how beautiful Honduras is.

'He had just finished a sightseeing tour of Britain with friends and headed out to Honduras to visit another friend working out there. I think he was also planning to travel across South America while he was out there.'

Mr Guler, who is manager of Celly's hairdressers in Southend, Essex, is now calling for better awareness of the potential dangers of travelling abroad.

He added: 'People need to be warned about the dangers of travelling across South America. I have lost a good friend and I don't want anyone else to have to suffer like he did.

'I only wish Omer had known that before he went out there.'
