At least 19 people have been killed and 60 others injured after Taliban militants launched a savage suicide bomb and gun attack on a Shi'ite mosque in Pakistan.

The radical Sunni Islamists stormed the mosque in Peshawar - close to the Afghan border - during  Friday prayers this afternoon and fired automatic weapons at random, local police said.

Amid the ensuing chaos three suicide bomb blasts were heard inside the mosque, which the Taliban are understood to have targeted because they think Shi'ites are not true Muslims.

The Pakistani Taliban, who are fighting  to set up a hardline Sunni theocracy in the country, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was revenge for Pakistan's crackdown on militants following a massacre at a school in the city that killed 145 people, including 132 children.

Police said armed men broke into the mosque, where people were attending Friday prayers, and opened fire, following which three explosions were heard inside the building.

'Either Pakistan will become your graveyard, or God's law, sharia, will be implemented,' Taliban commander Khaleefa Omar Mansoor said in a video in which he was flanked by three young militants clutching AK-47 assault rifles.

'This is the first in a series of revenge attacks... Wait for the rest,' Mansoor, who had earlier claimed responsibility for the December 16 school attack in which more than 150 people were killed, said in the video sent by email to reporters.

The style of the mosque attack was similar to that of the school attack, when gunmen arrived in a car, set it on fire, and broke into the building using a back entrance.

Peshawar's Hayatabad Medical Complex said at least 19 people had been killed in the latest attack.

The head of the provincial police, Nasir Durrani, said four or five attackers entered the mosque from a building next door that was under construction, then jumped over an outer wall into the mosque courtyard.

One person then blew himself up, creating a diversion so the other attackers could enter the mosque, Durrani said. He said at least three attackers died in the violence - two by blowing themselves up, and a third was killed by worshippers at the mosque.

'People here showed great courage. They grabbed one of the attackers from his neck, and he couldn't detonate (his explosives), and he was shot and killed,' Durrani added.

Authorities were still examining the scene, and Durrani did not say what happened to the remaining attacker or attackers.

Some people who fled the mosque reported that at least some of the attackers were wearing security uniforms.

'The prayer was about to end when a big bang happened, followed by dust and smoke. I have seen amid the smoke that one guy dressed in police uniform was firing shots and then there was another blast,' said one of the wounded, 22-year-old Syed Javed Hasan, speaking from his hospital bed.

At least 19 people were killed and 60 others injured after Taliban militants launched the attack on a Shi'ite mosque in the Pakistani city of Peshawar during Friday prayers this afternoon

The head of the provincial police, Nasir Durrani, said four or five attackers entered the mosque from a building next door that was under construction, then jumped over an outer wall into the mosque courtyard

A witness, Shahid Hussain, said that Shi'ite worshippers had just finished prayers when five or six men wearing military uniforms broke into the mosque and started shooting.

'We had no idea what was going on. One of the attackers then blew himself up and then there was huge smoke and dust all around,' he said.

The attack came as Pakistan tries to adopt new measures to tackle militants following the school massacre, in which 134 children were among the dead.

The government has pledged to crack down on all militant groups, and has reintroduced the death penalty, set up military courts to speed convictions and widened its offensive in northwestern areas on the Afghan border where militants find refuge.

Yet Pakistan's religious minorities, among them Ahmadis, Christians and Hindus, say the government is doing little to alleviate their daily struggle against discrimination and violence.

Last month, dozens of people were killed in a similar attack on a Shi'ite mosque in the southern town of Shikarpur.
