AirAsia has downplayed an incident that saw one of its planes turned back before takeoff in Indonesia, a week after another of its jets crashed into the Java Sea with 162 on board.

Indonesia AirAsia flight 7633 was taxiing in preparation for takeoff on Saturday at Surabaya airport - where last week's doomed flight also took off - when a power unit used to start the plane shut down, an airline official said.

As a result, the pilot turned back to the gate, Raden Achmad Sadikin, director of Safety and Security at Indonesia AirAsia, told reporters.

Local media in Indonesia and Malaysia had reported the Bandung-bound plane's engine had cut out after emitting a loud bang that terrified passengers, but AirAsia stressed it was a minor incident.

'It's not that the engine failed. The plane wanted to take off but the APU [auxiliary power unit], which is the equipment that helped to start the engine, suddenly shut down,' Mr Sadikin said.

The plane later landed safely at its destination in West Java after undergoing a check, Indonesia AirAsia chief executive Sunu Widyatmoko was quoted by local media as saying.

Meanwhile, AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes lashed out at the initial media reports, calling the headlines 'sensational' and 'silly'.

'Silly headlines in Malaysia. AirAsia Indonesia aircraft did not have a stalled engine. An APU which is ground power had to be restarted,' he said.

Mr Fernandes urged staff to remain strong.

'Facts will come out. As I have said we are calm, will take the hits now as our focus is families. But time will show what AirAsia is all about,' he tweeted.

The aircraft had taxied just three metres when passengers heard a loud bang, Indonesia's Metro TV reported.

The plane, bound for Bandung, Indonesia, made it back to the gate without any further problems and the 120 passengers were asked to disembark.

Passenger Yusuf Fitriadi told the TV station a man wearing a pilots’ uniform said to passengers the starter monitor had malfunctioned.

‘The plane was ready and moved, but suddenly a loud sound was heard, the sound of the engine disappeared and the plane moved backwards,’ Mr Fitriadi said.

‘We were shocked and panicked.’

Mr Fitriadi said the airline told passengers later the flight would be resumed after the problem had been addressed.

But he claimed about 90 per cent of the passengers refused to get back on board, fearing that the fault would re-occur during the flight.

Those who declined to get back on the plane had their fares refunded, Metro TV said. 

Meanwhile, Indonesian officials said weather was the 'triggering factor' in last week's crash of AirAsia flight 8501, with icing likely causing engine damage after it flew into a storm. 

As search teams reporting seeing a fifth large object at the bottom of the Java Sea which might be parts of the missing plane, the new drama involving an engine was the kind of news the airline did not want.

Another three bodies were recovered from flight QZ8501 on Monday, bringing the total number so far to 34.
