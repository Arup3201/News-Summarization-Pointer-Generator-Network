Strikes will cripple the country from November right through next year, union barons said yesterday.

They said millions of state workers will join a ‘long, hard and dirty’ dispute – the worst since the General Strike of 1926.

Vital services will be under threat from walk-outs by teachers, prison guards, firemen, nurses, gravediggers and paramedics.

Unions will coordinate their action to cause maximum chaos in their fight against the Government’s changes to gold-plated public sector pensions.

Speaking in London today, Unison boss Dave Prentis announced the ballots and raised the threat of a huge walk-out, which could bring the country to a standstill

George Osborne said yesterday that it 
was irresponsible to plot industrial action while negotiations on a 
settlement were still taking place. ‘Everyone who is sensible accepts 
that public sector pensions have to be reformed,’ said the Chancellor.

But union bosses insisted a one-day walkout would take place on November 30 – with others in the pipeline.

‘We are not talking about a day out 
and a bit of a protest,’ said Brian Strutton, national secretary at the 
GMB union. ‘We are talking about something that is long, hard and dirty 
as well.

‘This is going to require days of action, running through the winter into next year and right into the summer.’

Standing ovation: The announcement of ballots was met with thunderous applause

A wave of strikes would cause chaos in a year which includes the London Olympics and the Queen’s diamond jubilee.

In strikes in June, four unions were 
involved – the Public and Commercial Services union, the National Union 
of Teachers, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and the 
University and College Union.

But now ten are plotting action, 
including the Fire Brigades’ Union and Unison, which represents most 
hospital staff apart from doctors.

Even the Prison Officers’ Association, which is not legally allowed to strike, warned yesterday it is prepared to do so.

Dozens of smaller unions are also expected to join yesterday’s call to arms by the Trades Union Congress.

Dave Prentis, general secretary of 
Unison, said: ‘The fight of our lives may be an overused cliché but make
no mistake. This is it.’

To wild applause on the final day of 
the TUC’s annual conference, 15 union bosses took to the platform to 
slam the Government’s ‘sabotage’ of their pensions.

They are furious at the proposed 
pension changes, and have been battling with ministers since February 
during increasingly hostile negotiations.

Mark Serwotka, general secretary of 
the Public and Commercial Services Union, said: ‘There is no case 
whatsoever to make any changes to public sector pension schemes.’

However, Lord Hutton, a Labour 
ex-cabinet minister who was commissioned by the Government to propose 
changes, has described the system as inherently unfair. ‘It is my clear 
view that the figures … make it plain that the status quo is not 
tenable,’ he said.

Ros Altmann, a former Treasury 
pensions adviser, said: ‘Taxpayers cannot be asked to carry the burden 
for the sort of pensions that they will never enjoy themselves.’

Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office 
minister who is leading the negotiations, said the unions’ announcement 
yesterday was extremely disappointing.

The disruption threatens to be 
widespread, from schools forced to close for lack of staff to hospitals 
made to cancel operations.

It also presents a nightmare for 
working parents if schools shut down. There is nothing illegal about 
unions joining together to coordinate strike action on one particular 
day, or days, in a bid to cause maximum disruption.

They are allowed to pursue this type 
of industrial action as long as they have held a strike ballot with each
employer, and their members have voted ‘yes’.

Daniel Barnett, a leading employment 
barrister, said: ‘In the context of the current disputes over pension 
provision, every public sector worker will have a dispute over pension 
rights, so they can all go on strike.’

He said the Government’s only chance 
of stopping the strike was to take out an injunction if there were 
‘technical deficiencies’ in the way the ballots were held.
