A biker who lost control of his motorcycle, killing himself and his girlfriend in a 67mph crash, had only passed his test three days earlier, an inquest heard today.

Julian Farley, 25, and his partner Jessica Ellis, 23, died in a massive impact with a road sign after they fell from his 865cc Triumph Speedmaster motorcycle.

Mr Farley had been accelerating to overtake a 17-year-old motorist in a Nissan Micra on the A339 between Alton and Basingstoke, Hampshire, on Saturday, March 3 this year.

A police investigation found that the bike had been travelling at about 67mph in a 40mph zone when Mr Farley lost control, the inquest in Alton was told.

A friend of the couple, Imogen Wright, told the hearing that, on the day they died, they had travelled from their home in Portsmouth to visit her near Basingstoke.

'Jules had passed his motorcycle test on Wednesday and had bought a new bike,” she said. 'He appeared very proud of his new bike.

'He took me on a ride around the block.'

The inquest heard that the pair were in good spirits when they left and they intended to avoid motorways on their journey home.

On the way, they encountered college student Keiran Lenachan's black Nissan Micra.

Mr Lenachan, who was 17 and passed his driving test in October last year, was travelling with two friends Ben Harman and Rees Higgs. The three were preparing to go on a night out.

The hearing was told that, as they arrived at a roundabout in the left-hand lane, a motorcyclist with pillion passenger got into the right lane but tried to take the same exit as them.

Both vehicles had to slow and Mr Harman was heard to mutter the word 'idiot', the inquest was told.

The biker pulled in behind them and as they travelled along they came up behind a slow-moving Renault Clio.

As the road widened to become a dual carriageway, Mr Lenachan said he indicated and checked rear and side-view mirrors.

'The motorcyclist was directly behind
me in my top mirror, probably about 6ft or a car length behind,” he 
said. 'He didn’t look like he was going to overtake at all.

'As I started overtaking I saw sparks (in my mirror) and someone said "Stop", so I pulled into the lay-by.' 

The three got out of the car and ran back along the road, where they found the bodies of Mr Farley and Miss Ellis.

Other people arrived at the scene and a van driver felt for a pulse on Mr Farley but said: 'He’s gone.'

Mr Lenachan and his friends then all went into shock and had to be checked by paramedics, the hearing was told.

Mr Higgs said: 'I was so shocked I couldn’t speak. I didn’t know what to do or say.

'I couldn’t stop staring at the bodies even though I didn’t want to.'

The inquest heard that Mr Lenachan was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving but he was never charged.

Police at the scene found a skidmark which showed that Mr Farley's front tyre had veered towards the centre of the road.

'I have dealt with more motorbike deaths on the A339 than I dread to think'

- North-East Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley

Gouges were found in the road surface up to the point where the bike came to rest, more than 200ft further along the carriageway.

Antony Johnson, a retired police officer and a member of the Hampshire Police forensic collision investigation team, said: 'There is no physical evidence to suggest why the rider had taken this action - presumably because of events taking place in front of the Triumph.

'There is a possibility that experience, or inexperience, may have played a part in this incident.'

The force of the crash had dislodged the road sign from one of its supporting posts, the hearing was told.

Andrew Bradley, the coroner for north-east Hampshire, recorded a verdict of accidental death.

He said: 'I have been the coroner here for 23 years and I have dealt with more motorbike deaths on the A339 than I dread to think.

'It has been the most appalling road but it has improved...and this was a fairly isolated incident.'

After the hearing, Miss Ellis’s father Tony said: 'It’s a tragic accident and two beautiful young lives have been lost and lots of people are suffering.

'We weren’t here to blame. There are no winners and losers in this.'

He said of his daughter: 'She was the life and soul of the party. She was bubbly, eccentric, she was a big human being in a little package.'
