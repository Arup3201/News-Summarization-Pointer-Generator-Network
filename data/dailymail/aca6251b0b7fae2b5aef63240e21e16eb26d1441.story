A man who lost both his arms in an accident recently had his bicycle stolen and now he’s appealing to the thief’s conscience to get it back.

As if the plight of double amputee Hector Picard weren’t enough to make a thief twice, the South Florida man was about to use his bike to help someone else in need.

‘I'm raising money for a prosthetic for a little boy,’ Picard told Ft. Lauderdale’s WVSN as he fought back tears.

Picard, who lost his arms in a work accident, planned to start a charity ride June 8—to stretch from Ft. Lauderdale to Spokane, Washington—called Hands for Baby Jameson.

However, crooks put those plans on hold when they broke into Picard’s van and made off with his specially designed bike.

‘They were able to pull the bike that was strapped inside the car out through the back and dump stuff on the floor right over my prosthetic arms,’ Picard said.

Obvious: The bike was stolen from the South Florida man's van, which is covered in uplifting messages about his condition

And the prosthetics likely weren’t the crook’s first tip-off that they weren’t stealing just any bike.

A picture of the amputee riding his bike is emblazoned across the van, along with the uplifting messages like, ‘No hands, no problem, no excuses.’

Now Picard has made an appeal, hoping the thief will have the compassion to return the bike.

He said he’s willing not to ask any questions if the bike is quietly returned.

And if it isn’t? Picard said he’ll find a way to keep his promise to Baby Jameson, anyway.

‘I'm not going to let these jerks stop me,’ said a defiant Picard. ‘I'll still do it.’

'If I have to use my old bike, I'll struggle a little more. But I'm going to get it done anyway.'

Picard lost his arms in 1992 at the age of 24. He has since become a motivation speaker and runs a website, where you can read about and give to his causes, here.

Conviction: 'I'm not going to let these jerks stop me,' Picard said and plans to make his ride frm Ft. Lauderdale to Spokane no matter what
