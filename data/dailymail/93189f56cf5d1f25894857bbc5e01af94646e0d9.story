San Francisco broadcaster KGO reported some bullets struck inside surrounding homes, including one that lodged in a refrigerator.

By early Saturday, police had covered some areas of the shooting scene with yellow tarps. Police cordoned off several blocks, and canvassed the area for witnesses.

Police believe the car in which the men were killed may have been stolen, the Chronicle said. 

Police alerted the California Highway Patrol that a vehicle possibly linked to the violence could be headed toward the Pacific Coast highway, the newspaper said.
