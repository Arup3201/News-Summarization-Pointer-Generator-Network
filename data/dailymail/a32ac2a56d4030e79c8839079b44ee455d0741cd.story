Sadistic: Nicolae Patraucean, 21, has been jailed for a minimum of 25 years over the depraved murder

A 'sadistic' builder who strangled a 55-year-old woman, slit her throat and mutilated her body with a Stanley knife has been jailed for at least 25 years.

Nicolae Patraucean, 21, had drunk heavily and taken cannabis, cocaine and heroin in the 24 hours before the brutal murder in Colindale, north London.

The Old Bailey heard Rivka Holden was pronounced dead at her home on March 16 after a panicked caller flagged down a passing police car outside her house. 

Detectives discovered her red Hyundai, usually parked outside, was missing and it was later found abandoned in the nearby suburb of Kingsbury.

But robbery was not thought to be the motive for the killing - as large amounts of cash were found intact in Ms Holden's flat.

Instead prosecutors said Ms Holden, originally from Israel, was murdered in an act of pure sadism.

Prosecutor Timothy Cray told a previous hearing: ‘We would say it’s particularly serious on the grounds of sadism'.

Defence barrister David Spens QC previously insisted Patraucean, originally from Romania, did not suffer from any mental illness.

He said: ‘Apart from some self-harm, there is nothing else that we are aware of and indeed the family members who know him well do not speak of any mental illness as such.

‘The problem appears to be one that involves the excessive intake of drink and drugs.’

Judge Timothy Pontius QC jailed Patraucean, from Stanmore, north London, for life today and ordered he serve at least 25 years before he can be considered for parole.

The sentence came after a complex legal hearing to establish the circumstances of the killing.

Detective Inspector Simon Ashwin, of the Met Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'I hope this sentence gives Ms Holden's family some solace in knowing that her killer has been brought to justice and will spend many years in prison.'

Speaking after her death, Julian Mann, of the local Kingsbury Synagogue, said: ‘She was very warm and would sometimes drop into us for a chat and something to eat.

‘My wife and I enjoyed talking to her.

‘She also chatted in Hebrew with my son, who is a Rabbi, and asked which Rabbis she could go to for a blessing for her health.

‘She had already had an operation on her foot and her walking was limited.’
