Two men have been arrested after attempting to import 88kg of heroin and 21kg of methamphetamines worth $75 million into Sydney in a frozen fish shipment.

Police charged two Canadian-Vietnamese men, aged 55 and 57, after intercepting the 100kg drug delivery from Kuala Lumpur earlier this month.

The 100kg of drugs were found hidden in ice packs beneath frozen fish in three pallets of white polystyrene boxes on September 8.

NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione described the incident as 'organised crime at its worst' with the drug haul worth $75 million

Customs officers tested the brown and clear liquid and when it came up positive for heroin and ice police seized the drugs and put an inert substance in its place.

Police say two men allegedly accessed the shipment and removed the contents of the polystyrene boxes the following day.

Two dual Canadian-Vietnamese nationals were arrested and charged with a number of offences relating to the importation after NSW and Australian Federal Police raided a house in Fairfield, south west of Sydney, last Thursday.

A number of items were located at the Fairfield house including a makeshift heavy duty press, which police believe can be used to compress bricks of heroin.

The arrested pair will face court in Sydney later this month.

Federal police, customs, NSW police, the Australian Crime Commission and the NSW Crime Commission were involved in the operation.

The drugs equated to more than 780,000 street deals of heroin and 200,000 hits of ice.

'Organised crime groups prey on the vulnerable and leech from the law-abiding majority,' Commissioner Scipione said.

'We make no apologies for relentlessly hunting down those who shamelessly enhance their own lives by ruthlessly destroying others.'

Australian Crime Commission State Manager NSW, Warren Gray, said the arrests and seizures were a significant success in the fight against serious and organised crime.

“Depending on the purity, 88kg of heroin can equate more than 780,000 street deals worth up to $54 million dollars,' he said.

'This partnered with the seizure of 21kg of methamphetamine - one of Australia’s most dangerous drugs - is a massive win for law enforcement and the Australian community.'
