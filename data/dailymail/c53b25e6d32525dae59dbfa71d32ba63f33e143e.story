Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert has slammed the ambition of Southampton’s owners for allowing ex-Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino to leave for Premier League rivals Tottenham.

After months of speculation Pochettino signed a five-year deal back in May to become head coach at Spurs and Lambert believes his exit lead to the player exodus at Southampton this summer.

‘There’s obviously a reason why the gaffa went and that was the moment it became clear to the players what the ambition of the club was going to be,' Lambert told Fox Sports.

The former Argentina defender impressed during his 16-month reign at Saints, leading the south coast club to their best-ever Premier League finish of eighth last season.

However, soon after Pochettino’s departure to White Hart Lane, there was an exodus of star talent at St Mary’s as Lambert, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren departed for rival Premier League clubs.

Lambert feels the criticism directed towards the players by Southampton fans should be re-directed at the club’s owners:

‘Obviously a few of the players who have left have taken a bit of stick but that’s football. It’s been surprising it’s all been at the players and not on the owners.’

The England international striker was evidently delighted to make his competitive debut for Liverpool during their 2-1 win over Southampton at the weekend:

‘Yeh it’s so special I managed to get on and make my debut, obviously it was mixed emotions against my old teammates but it was brilliant.

‘We scored the winner and I had a little contribution in it, so it was excellent.’

Despite his departure from Southampton in the summer, Lambert has retained a decent relationship with the Saints fans who chanted at him at Anfield on Sunday:

‘I loved Southampton fans, I’ve got a good relationship with them and it was nice that they acknowledged me in the way that they did.

‘I tried to acknowledge them back in the same manner with the same kind of respect. I’ve got nothing but respect for Southampton Football Club, the players and the fans.'
