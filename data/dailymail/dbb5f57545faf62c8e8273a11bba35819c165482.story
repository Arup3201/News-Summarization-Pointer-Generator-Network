DCI April Casburn has been charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act

A senior counter-terrorism detective has been charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act, it can be reported for the first time today.

DCI April Casburn, 53, is accused of offering the News of the World information about Operation Varec, set up in 2010 into whether the Met inquiry into phone hacking should be re-opened.

It is said she contacted the now-defunct newspaper on 11 September, 2010, and in doing so 'wilfully misconducted herself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the publicâ€™s trust in that office'.

Casburn is also charged under the Official Secrets Act in relation to secret documents allegedly found at her home.

It is said on 21 December 2011 she, 'by virtue of her position had in her possession or under her control, documents which it would be an offence under the Act for her to disclose without lawful authority and she failed to take such care to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the document as a person in her position may reasonably be expected to take.'

The official secrets act charge could not previously be reported as it was protected by a court order but was lifted by District Judge Quentin Purdy at Westminster Magistrates Court today.

It relates to documents to do with her counter-terrorism work marked secret which it is said were found at her home.

Casburn, 53, of Chelmsford, Essex, was released on unconditional bail and will appear at the Old Bailey on November 2.

Casburn is the former head of the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit which supports some of the most sensitive police inquiries.

She is the first person to be 
charged under Operation Elveden, the controversial inquiry into the 
bribing of public officials for information.

The News of The World was closed down in July 2011 due to the phone hacking scandal
