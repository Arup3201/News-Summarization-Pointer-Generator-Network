Police sergeant Louise Gibson took her own life after discovering her cheating PC husband was having an affair with a PCSO, an inquest heard today.

All three officers worked together at the same police station and when she discovered the affair, it was the 43-year-old sergeant who was sent home.

The decision to relieve the distraught woman of her frontline duties was criticised at an inquest into her death  when her parents accused the force of abandoning her.

Her sister Katrina said: 'Thames Valley Police has offered no support to our family and has consistently put the mental wellbeing of Louise’s estranged husband over her family.' 

Following a huge police search, Sergeant Gibson’s body was found on May 19, four days after she stormed out of her parents’ home less than a mile from where she died.

The inquest into her death heard that the day she vanished, Sergeant Gibson, had a meeting with colleagues about her marriage and was asked to hand over some of her duties while her personal situation was sorted.

The hearing in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire was told that Sergeant Gibson was left distressed by the meeting, feeling that her marriage and career were over.

She was taken home and told her father she wanted to die.

After overhearing her father telling her sister that only crazy people killed themselves, Sergeant Gibson stormed out of the house and was not seen by her family again.

Three suicide notes and a will were found in her bedroom.

Coroner Richard Hulett recorded a verdict of suicide.

Speaking after the inquest, Sergeant Gibson’s tearful sister Katrina said the family believed there were a number of unanswered questions surrounding the case and that information was withheld from them.

Describing her sister as a 'beautiful person and a wonderful mother', she said: 'As her family we are very disappointed with how the investigation into the causes behind Louise’s death have been handled.

Following the inquest, Louise Gibson’s sister Katrina issued a statement, saying the family felt Thames Valley Police had lied to them.

She said: 'Thames Valley Police have offered no support to our family, and have consistently put the emotional well-being of Louise’s estranged husband John White Gibson, above that of Louise’s parents and her children, especially her 15 year old daughter.

Louise Gibson had been a Sergeant at Wycombe Police Station with her husband PC John Gibson where he started an affair with a PCSO

'They have consistently withheld information from us, and as such we still have a lot of questions that have not been answered.

'Why was Louise forced to work in the same station as her estranged husband and his mistress for months, when she had repeatedly asked to be moved?

'Why was she offered no welfare support from senior officers?

'Why has there been no investigation into Louise’s missing will?

'Why was Louise’s case being presented on the part of the police in this inquest by an officer who had never met her?

'The list goes on and on.

'Louise was a beautiful person and a wonderful mother, and her actions were completely out of character.

'Whatever reasons Thames Valley give for her death, Louise was a strong person.

'None of the people who really knew Louise and know the situation she was in believe that she would have done this, unless she was driven to it.

'We will continue to fight for justice and for the answers to our questions - for Louise, for her children and for all of the people who loved her.'

Sgt. Gibson’s father, Charles Ward, added that he was angry that Louise had been left at home without anyone explaining to him what had happened at the meeting that day.

Mr Ward said: 'Why was a hugely competent officer who was suddenly unable to perform her duties effectively due to some form of mental stress and of which they had been well aware taken to the house at Kingshill and abandoned at the roadside?

'Why was no attempt made to check that there were persons present to deal with the situation or to advise anybody at all that she was in a very bad place?'

Sergeant Gibson, a Thames Valley Police officer of more than 10 years and mother of three, had previously been married to Tony Cook.

She remarried John Gibson, aged 40 years, who she worked alongside at Wycombe police station, but the couple did not have any children together.

When working the couple slept at Sergeant.Gibson’s parents home in Great Kingshill, but had a home in Macclesfield, where she was originally from.

In the weeks leading up to her death Sergeant Gibson was going through a breakup with her husband and he no longer slept in Kingshill.

She was then told by someone at work that he was having an affair with the unnamed PCSO.

Sergeant Gibson confronted both about the affair but they denied it.

She then told her father she was going to hire a private investigator to get proof of the affair and a few days later showed Mr Ward a photo of her husband’s car outside the woman’s house in the middle of the night.

When Sergeant Gibson confronted her husband with the evidence, he admitted the affair.

As the situation at work became difficult, Sergeant Gibson was called into a meeting on May 15 to discuss what was going on.

Louise Gibson's sister Katrina, left,  asked Thames Valley Police: 'Why was Louise forced to work in the same station as her estranged husband and his mistress for months, when she had repeatedly asked to be moved?'

Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Brown told the inquest: 'The meeting was in relation to the ongoing personal circumstances between her and her husband and the effect it was having on her team and the relationship with her husband at the police station.

'They (the supervisors) decided the best help they could give Louise was to take her from what was a very pressured, front line, supervisory role for a short time so she could address her personal issues.

'This didn’t sit well with Louise in terms of her professional career development.

'Her view was she had lost her husband and now she was losing her job.'

The distressed officer was taken back to her parents’ home, where she was spoken to by her father at around 4.30pm.

Mr Ward said: 'She said her life was over and her career was ruined.

'She said John had won and that the team had been taken away from her but that John and this girl were still allowed to carry on.

'She also said she didn’t care if she was alive anymore and didn’t want to wake up in the morning.'

The cause of death was given in accordance with the medical evidence.  

Following the inquest into Sergeant Gibson’s suicide, a spokesman for Thames Valley Police said it is continuing to support her family and colleagues.

Assistant Chief Constable Chris Shead said: 'Our thoughts today remain with Louise’s family at this very difficult time.

'I can only imagine the sense of loss they must feel.

'Louise was a hugely popular and well-performing officer who is sorely missed by her colleagues.

'Many of the staff and officers who knew her have deeply felt the loss of Louise and we continue to offer ongoing support.'

The circumstances surrounding the sergeant’s death were referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation.

The watchdog has since asked Thames Valley Police to carry out a local probe, which is ongoing, before reporting back to the IPCC.
