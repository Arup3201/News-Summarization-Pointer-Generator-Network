Benefits Street star White Dee is becoming a role model for a generation of Brits who think they don't have to work, a top Labour MP has claimed.

Simon Danczuk, who was brought up by a single mother on benefits, attacked the 'circus' surrounding the controversial mother of two - who shot to fame as the star resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street.

He told MailOnline her recent antics, where she was pictured enjoying a lavish holiday in Magaluf despite claiming she is too depressed to work, were 'fetishising benefits culture'.

White Dee partied in Magaluf despite claiming that she was too ill to work

Dee - whose real name is Diedre Kelly - was seen partying in the Spanish resort, lounging by a pool and swigging Champagne during her four-day sunshine break.

The trip sparked claims that she could be questioned by officials over whether her financial or medical circumstances had changed since the Channel 4 show.

But the mother of two, who is said to receive around £200 a week in benefits, is now planning trips to France and Spain to raise her mood.

Mr Danczuk said: 'I do not think it's healthy that White Dee is held up as some sort of poster girl for benefits.

'This fuels a culture whereby people think you can be famous for doing nothing, even claiming benefits.

'The welfare system is a vital safety net but it shouldn't be glamorised and the circus surrounding White Dee doesn't help anyone.

'She clearly has a lot to offer and should be known for realising her potential, not being on benefits.

'Dee needs supporting back into work and all the hangers on and TV agents that think caricaturing people on benefits is great for ratings should take a long hard look at themselves.

'We need to be encouraging people into work and helping them make something of themselves, not fetishising benefits culture.'

During the controversial documentary Benefits Street, Dee said she had suffered from depression since her mother died and has 'good days and bad days' with the condition.

Her agent told MailOnline earlier this week: ‘Dee has been back in the UK since Saturday. Dee had lots of fun as the many pictures show.

‘She missed the children [and] she hates flying, but she understands why we are trying to get her active to help us decide the suitability for some projects we would like her to undertake in the future.

‘She is not on Job Seekers’ Allowance as reported - she is on [Employment and] Support Allowance. We have been in touch with the benefits agency since we started to represent Dee in February.’

The Department for Work and Pensions has refused to comment on her case directly, but was prompted to mount a fresh defence of its welfare plans following anger at her holiday.

A DWP Spokesman said: 'We are reforming disability benefits by introducing a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews for Disability Living Allowance - something missing under the old system.

'We are also re-assessing people on incapacity benefits to see what work they can do - with the right support - rather than just writing them off on sickness benefits as happened in the past.

'Our welfare reforms will ensure that support goes to those who need it most.'

There is no suggestion Dee has broken the rules, but since starring in Benefits Street she has appeared on TV several times and been linked with a string of new jobs including standing as an MP and becoming a TV chef.

This week she took to Facebook to deny claims that she drank champagne while on her holiday.

Dee, 42, said: ‘I’m turning into Jesus - making cloudy lemonade turn into booze. You gotta love the press haha.’

Her agent said she had been offered TV work but was still ‘too unwell’.

‘It is like a light switch goes off when you are with her, sometimes she’s fine but then suddenly her whole mood will change and there’s nothing you can do,’ he said of her condition.

‘She could easily earn half a million from one of these, but she doesn’t want to at the moment.’
