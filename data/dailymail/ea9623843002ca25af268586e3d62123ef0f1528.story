It is a spectacular video that provides and entirely different view of South Africa's most iconic city.

A holidaymaker made his own travel video of Cape Town while visiting the city, by flying a drone over the coastline and spectacular sights to capture footage of sharks feeding in the shallows, seals sunbathing on rocky outcrops and tourists enjoying the views from Table Mountain. 

Eric Cheng, 38, from San Francisco, holidayed in Cape Town in August and decided to use the drone for a new perspective on the city.

Using a DJI Phantom 2 quadcopter with a Zenmuse H3-3D gimbal and a GoPro Hero 3+ camera, Eric caught a bird's eye view around the city and along the coast. 

It soared over hundreds of seals as they rested on rocks in the hot sun. From the safety of land and boat Eric explored a shipwreck marooned off the coast of Duiker Point. 

The BOS 400 ran aground while being towed two decades ago and has been left to rot by the sea. 

He piloted the drone over Seal Island, where thousands of seals fish for food, and nearby, great white sharks are lured with bait.

Eric said: 'It took many drone flights over a week on location, but in some places, I only did one or two flights. 

'I was particularly excited to capture aerial footage of great white sharks at Seal Island, one of the best places in the world to observe great white sharks.

'I also really enjoyed seeing an aggregation of spotted gully sharks in the surf near Cape Point.

'A brown fur seal was surfing in the waves alongside the sharks, and even chased some of them around.'

The short aerial film shows the beauty of Cape Town and its surrounding area, including Lion's Head, Table Mountain, Cape Point, Hout Bay, Simon's Town, and Seal Island.
