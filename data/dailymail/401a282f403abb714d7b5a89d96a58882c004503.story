A grandfather is still cleaning his house with an almost 80-year-old Hoover - built the same year Edward VIII abdicated and just four years younger than himself.

Bernard Storey, 82, regularly vacuum cleans his carpets with the Hoover 825, which rolled off  production lines in 1936 - the same year as the Summer Olympics in Berlin.

The ahead-of-it's time machine would have cost around £25 when it was new - the equivalent of around £1,200 to £1,500 in today’s money - and previously belonged to Mr Storey's mother Emma, who was given it by the lady she used to clean for.

Apart from a few patches on the dust bag, Mr Storey believes the machine has never been repaired

He rediscovered the ancient machine when he was cleaning out his workshop and was stunned to discover it still worked.

He said: 'My mother was given this Hoover by the lady she used to clean for,' said Mr Storey, from Holbeach, Lincolnshire.

'She got a newer model and gave my mother this one. She always used it up until she had a stroke and went into hospital; she never had another.

'My brother threw it out when she died, and I rescued it.'

Apart from a few patches on the dust bag, Mr Storey believes the machine has never been repaired.

The upright silver and grey model was quite advanced for its day and boasts an adjustable handle with three positions, two speeds - with a lower setting for cleaning flexible, small lightweight rugs - as well as a light and a hose with attachments.

The machine would have cost around £25 when it was new - the equivalent of around £1,200 to £1,500 in today's money. It previously belonged to Mr Storey's mother Emma (pictured in the 1930s), who was given it by the lady she used to clean for

But despite the Hoover's dedicated service over the years, Mr Storey, who does all the cleaning at the home he shares with wife Beryl, 80, admits he still prefers his Dyson DC24i for most of the cleaning as the 825 is very heavy

It also has an Aromador, which, with the twist of a valve knob, releases a 'pleasing smell' to mask cooking and stale odours.

Mr Storey, who does all the cleaning at the home he shares with wife Beryl, 80, admits he still prefers his Dyson DC24i for most of the cleaning as the 825 is very heavy.

'You’d have quite a job using it all the time I think, because of the weight, but the suction is good,' he added.

'It’s certainly as good as anything you could buy today. I think it was one of the top models of its day - mother never used anything else.

'I am surprised it still goes - they don’t make things like they used to.'
