A 30-year-old cancer sufferer will finally marry her boyfriend of nearly 10 years this weekend after waiting until now because marriage would have affected her health insurance.

Jennifer Hutcheson, from Flint, Michigan, will wed 49-year-old Allen Korth on Sunday with the help of a charity, Wish Upon A Wedding.

Although the couple have long been engaged, she did not want to walk down the aisle because marriage would cause her to lose her insurance benefits and see the costs of a plan soar.

But in February, she entered hospice care meaning that 100 per cent of her end of life care will be covered by her insurance company - which also means that the couple can finally marry.

Final wish: Jennifer Hutcheson, 30, who has cancer of the esophagus, will marry Allen Korth, 49, on Sunday

'When
 there's something you've always wanted and you're faced with death... 
it kind of brings peace to you,' she told MLive. 'There's something about changing your 
last name to the person you love. It's just important to me that I get 
to do that.'

The non-profit organization, as well and family and friends, have swooped in to plan the wedding in just three weeks, helping Hutcheson select her dress and a brown curly wig for the occasion.

'It's kind
 of surreal, emotional,' she said. 'It's going to be better than I
 thought it would be. Being able to afford a wedding on its own 
would be hard to do at this time for us. It wouldn't have been done.'

The couple met through work just before Hutcheson turned 21, quickly became friends and soon started dating. But when she was 25, her family noticed she was losing weight.

She went to the doctor and discovered she had a tumor in her esophagus. They later found the cancer had spread to her stomach and ovaries, causing her to undergo a hysterectomy. In February 2010, she was given less than a year to live.

Fighter: Hutcheson was diagnosed with cancer when she was 25 and has been in remission multiple times but in February she was given just two to six months to live. Two months ago, she entered hospice care

'I fought and fought and fought for the time that I had,' Hutcheson said. 'Somehow, my body started to get better.'

But the cancer returned, this time attacking her liver. Again she battled it, but by November 2013, it had returned to her esophagus and new cancer was also found in her stomach, her intestines, her liver, gall bladder and her pancreas.

In total, she battled through seven rounds of chemotherapy and three rounds of radiation but in February, she was given just two to six months to live.

She now weighs just 88 pounds but hopes she'll be able to walk down the aisle without using her wheelchair - and she can't wait to see what her husband-to-be thinks of her look.

'I'm really excited to get his reaction,' she said. 'I look healthy with everything together, the makeup people and the hair people. I have a nice wig and the dress. You get to feel good.'

Korth told Mlive he is excited to celebrate with his new bride on Sunday.

'She
 is a happy, happy person,' he said. 'She is completely genuine. She has never,
 ever been who she's not. Not even once.'

Fight: Since she was 25, Jennifer has suffered cancer of the esophagus, liver, stomach, ovaries, gall bladder and pancreas. She has undergone seven rounds of chemotherapy - but still remains smiling

Early days: The couple is pictured in their first photo together in 2005. Jennifer is now just 88 pounds

She added: 'He 
just treats me well and (he's) able to be the rock I need when things 
fall apart for me, hold me together when I'm falling apart. He stood by me even when I told him he didn't have to.

'We don't 
spend a lot of time thinking about cancer. We spend more time talking 
about politics and silly stuff and he makes funny cartoon (voices). We 
just have a good time and he keeps me laughing. It's worth it.'

The couple's wedding will be the third hosted by Wish Upon a Wedding in Michigan since 2011. It provides weddings and vow renewals to couples facing terminal illness and serious life-changing circumstances.

Hutcheson said she wishes she could join the team to help people the same way she's been helped through the process.
