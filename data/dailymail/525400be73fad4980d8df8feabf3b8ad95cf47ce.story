Accused: Hannah Bonser appeared in court today accused of killing Casey Kearney, 13, at a park in Doncaster

This is the first picture of a woman accused of killing a 13-year-old girl in a park knife attack.

Hannah Bonser, 26, appeared at Doncaster Magistrates Court today charged with the murder of 13-year-old Casey Kearney in a park in the town.

Casey managed to phone 999 from her mobile and told the operator she had been stabbed in what police said was a ‘random and unprovoked’ attack on Tuesday.

Children playing in the town centre park who saw her slump to the ground then watched in horror as she struggled to breathe before they ran to get help.

She died in hospital and last night 
police charged Bonser of Doncaster, with murder and possessing two knives.

She appeared before 
Doncaster magistrates this morning and was remanded in custody as Casey's parents paid tribute to 'beautiful and intelligent.

Bonser, who has brown, shoulder-length hair, was wearing a dark blue T-shirt which concealed a tattoo on her left arm.

She nodded to confirm her name and date of birth and gave her address in Doncaster.

She listened as the murder charge was put to her and a separate charge of possessing two knives.

Relatives of Casey listened in the public gallery, some sobbing, as the details of the case were outlined.

The defendant looked at the floor throughout the 15-minute hearing, occasionally glancing upwards as the prosecutor read out details of the case.

Magistrates remanded her in custody and she will next appear at Sheffield Crown Court on February 23.

Today Casey's parents paid tribute to their daughter in a statement.

It said: 'Losing Casey has been so painful words cannot begin to explain.

'She
was the most beautiful, intelligent and bright young girl with her 
whole life ahead of her. We need time alone with family and friends to 
start to come to terms with our loss.'

Casey had left her home in Rossington at
around midday on Tuesday and caught the bus to Doncaster town centre 
where she was going to meet a friend, but never arrived.

Sadness: Friends of tragic teenager Casey embrace at Elmfield Park in Doncaster where she was stabbed to death

Police at Elmfield Park, which was described by locals as 'rough' and unsafe for children

Witnesses have told of seeing a woman, clearly drunk and swearing loudly, on the day of the murder.

Officers revealed the suspect was 
known to a ‘number of agencies’, believed to include a local NHS trust 
and the council’s social services department.

Attack: Casey, pictured at a family event holding a baby, managed to call police after she was stabbed

Casey had been on the way to see a friend as she walked through the centre of Doncaster at lunchtime on Valentine’s Day.

She caught the No 55 bus into town 
from her home in Rossington, about five miles away. She had just got off
the bus to walk to a friend’s house when she was stabbed once in the 
abdomen. She was rushed to hospital but died eight hours later.

The teenager was in Elmfield Park when
she phoned 999 from her mobile at 1.18pm and told the operator she had 
been attacked. She then slumped to the ground near a play park. Several 
passers-by rushed to help her.

Detective Superintendent Terry Mann, of South Yorkshire Police, said the family had been left traumatised by the death.

He added: 'They are a loving family. It is a very, very sad case. They are very traumatised by this, as you can imagine.'

Her
friend Alisha Leggot told ITV News: 'I rang a few times, I left some 
voicemails to tell her to contact us because we were worried about her.

'But
we knew what had gone off in the park and I think one of us literally 
had a feeling that something had gone wrong but I just didn't want to 
believe it.

'Everyone 
was saying it was Casey on Facebook and then I got in last night and 
turned on the news because we knew it would be on there and I saw 
Casey's picture and it just broke me.

'I don't really know what to do.'

Catherine Brown, head teacher at 
McAuley Catholic High School, issued a statement on behalf of the 
governing body, staff and pupils.

It
said: 'The whole school community of McAuley Catholic High School is 
shocked and saddened to learn of the death of Casey Kearney, a pupil in 
year 9, in such tragic circumstances.

'Casey was a valued member of her form and year group and will be sadly missed by friends, pupils and staff.

'We are all thinking of her family and friends at this time.

'We look forward to welcoming students back to school on Monday where there will be appropriate support for them.'

Grief: People make their way to the scene of the killing to lay flowers today

Shaken: Local tennis coach John Willis (pictured), found the girl at the park after she phoned 999

Tennis coach John Willis, 58, was 
teaching in courts inside the park when his children Owen, ten, and 
Matthew, five, rushed over from the playground and said a ‘lady was 
having a fit, she is on the ground. Can you come and help, Daddy?’

He said: ‘I ran over as quickly as I could and another woman who I had seen in the park earlier was already tending to her. 

‘The girl was on the ground and her 
breathing was very shallow. She was on the unconscious side of 
semi-conscious and stirred a bit as we put her in the recovery 
position.’

Mr Willis said his elder son had seen 
the girl ‘walking normally’ through the park and when he looked across 
again she was ‘on her knees and leaning forward as if she was trying to 
get something out of her bag’.

Emotions: Heartfelt messages at the scene included one from the Willis family, left, after John found the girl at the park

The boy then saw her fall forward on to her face. The girl had blood on one of her hands, Mr Willis said.

Police arrived moments later and took 
over the first aid until a paramedic arrived. He checked her over and 
then said: ‘Clear the area – she’s been stabbed.’

Mr Willis added: ‘It was shocking at 
the time and even more upsetting to find out the poor girl has not 
survived. It all felt very surreal but the full horror of what has 
happened is beginning to sink in.

‘I cannot imagine what that young girl’s family are going through. My thoughts are with them.’

Violence: The injured teenager managed to stagger away after the attack in Elmfield Park, Doncaster and dialled 999

Panic: Casey-Lyanne was treated at the scene after making a frantic call to police from her mobile phone

Police have appealed for information 
from anyone who saw Casey during her trip out on Tuesday. They want to 
establish whether she was stabbed inside the park or outside before 
walking in while calling 999.

Elmfield Park has been sealed off while 
police search for clues and carry out forensic tests. Two knives have 
been found, but police do not know if either is the murder weapon.

Casey was 5ft 3in tall with long 
straight ginger hair. She was wearing a black waist-length jacket and 
blue jeans and carrying a black Bench shoulder bag with purple writing.

Detective Superintendent Terry Mann, of South Yorkshire Police, said: 
‘The death of a 13-year-old is very tragic, they are a loving family. 
It’s a very sad case and they are very traumatised.’

Appealing for witnesses, Mr Mann said:
‘I can’t urge anyone enough, any detail no matter how small, please 
come forward. Think about what Casey’s family are going through – 
imagine if this was your daughter, sister, niece or friend.’

Grisly: An ambulance and two rapid response cars rushed to the park at around 1pm to help the girl

Mr Mann said they had yet to establish
a motive and that the attack was not believed to be a robbery. Acting 
Chief Superintendent Peter Norman added: ‘This appears to be an 
isolated, unprovoked and random incident.’

He said there had been only three 
minor assaults in the park over the past 12 months and 39 reports of 
‘low-level anti-social behaviour’.

Another girl of 13 said she and two 
friends were screamed at by a woman in the park on Tuesday afternoon. 
The woman swore at them for no reason and she appeared to be drunk and 
was holding a can. ‘We kept walking fast away from her and didn’t say 
anything back,’ she said. Agencies in the town have already met with Mr 
Norman to pool information about the victim and suspect.

Jo Miller, chief executive of 
Doncaster Council, said: ‘We can confirm that we are all working hard to
piece together what happened yesterday and also gathering any 
information we can.

Tragic death: The schoolgirl was taken to Doncaster Royal Infirmary after the brutal assault - but died of her injuries hours later

‘The person in custody was known to a 
number of local public agencies and we are working together to establish
all the circumstances involved with this case.’

Casey’s parents have split up and are both in new relationships.

She has a younger sister Sophie, ten. 
Her mother Kerry Day, 32, and father Anthony Kearney, 31, were too upset
to comment yesterday.

Friend Natalia Bojor, 14, described Casey as a ‘really lovely’ girl with ‘loads of friends’.

She added: ‘She worked really hard at school and I think she wanted to go into something to do with the media.

‘Everyone is really upset about what’s happened.’
