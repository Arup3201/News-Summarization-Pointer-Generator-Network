Residents in far north Queensland are being told to brace for a fierce and destructive storm twice the strength of last year’s Cyclone Ita.

Cyclone Nathan is forecast to strike Cooktown and Hope Valeat 4am on Friday morning as a category four system with winds of up to 260km/h.

But the Bureau of Metrology has warned the storm could well increase into a maximum-strength category five before it hits, ppsing a grave threat to residents in the firing line of the storm, reports ABC.

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczu warned residents should prepare for the worst.

'Tonight will be a frightening event for many families. I express on behalf of all Queenslanders that our thoughts and prayers are with all those families,’ she said.

The storm is expected to be more severe than Cyclone Ita, which saw roofs torn from houses and huge trees pulled from the ground in April 2014.

Cyclone Nathan is expected to stick around for hours, and could even remain a category two cyclone by 2pm on Friday.

'We are preparing for the worst, but we are prepared,' Palaszczu said on Thursday. 

Residents have been urged to stay home, as long as their house was built after 1985.

Those living in homes predating this time are advised to seek shelter in cyclone shelters.
