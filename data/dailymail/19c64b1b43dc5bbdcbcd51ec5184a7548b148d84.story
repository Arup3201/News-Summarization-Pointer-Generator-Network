The woman accused of stalking New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman pretended to be pregnant with his baby, her mother claims.

After Louise Neathway told her ex-lover Mr Cashman of her claim and threatened to air it publicly, he gave her $6,000 to have an abortion.

But her mother later told him that she had invented the claim - and said it was not the first time she had lied about having an abortion, according to the New York Post.

Mr Cashman, 44, appeared under strain over the weekend when he visited his wife, who is filing for divorce in the wake of his alleged affair with Ms Neathway.

But he may have received some relief 
from the revelation that Ms Neathway, 36, was never in fact pregnant - 
despite demanding $15,000 for an 'unspecified medical issue'.

The Yankees boss was told that this claim was false during a meeting on January 27 with Ms Neathway's mother Caroline Meanwell.

Ms Meanwell 'apologised to [Mr Cashman] for all the trouble and was very emotional,' according to a source for the Post.

'She said [Ms Neathway] was never pregnant, and had lied about it in the past as well.

'She said she had made [previous] claims of fake pregnancies and fake abortions.'

On that same day, Ms Neathway sent Mr
Cashman a message about her alleged pregnancy and attached what she 
said was an ultrasound scan of their baby.

The trove of emails sent to Mr 
Cashman and his lawyer by Ms Neathway, who who has been charged with 
stalking and harrassing the father of two, was obtained by the Daily 
News.

'What Brian Cashman has done to me is
both incomprehensible and unforgivable,' Ms Neathway reportedly wrote 
in an email sent with the scan on January 29.

'I am going to the press and 
informaing [sic] them of the preganacy [sic] and the abortion. And 
everything else,' she wrote in an error-littered message.

'So you can have a little gloat at my
agony here is my ultra sound picture. . . I guess its ok for me to just
push this aside right? Men!!!'

Yankees boss Brian Cashman's wife has filed for a divorce after he was publicly accused of the affair with Neathway

Ms Neathway, in a separate email sent
a day later, threatened to make Mr Cashman’s life hell unless he paid 
for her 'abortion'. She also warned that any threats against her would 
backfire, claiming she worked for British intelligence agency MI6.

'I will not tolerate threats by any 
means, of a criminal nature, as that will bite Brian in the backside and
probably will be the biggest personal mistake of his life,' wrote the 
mother of one, according to the Daily News.

Mr Cashman's wife Mary, 42, filed for
divorce a day after Ms Neathway faced her charges in court on Thursday 
claiming to have had an affair with him.

When the baseball manager visited his
wife at their Darien home he spent less than a minute in the house, 
which he moved out of when the claims first emerged.

Scruffily dressed and with dark rings under his eyes from lack of sleep, the pressure was clearly showing.

Mr Cashman is the latest in a line of
men who claim Ms Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone 
hacking and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and 
former friends claim.

On Thursday prosecutors said Ms 
Neathway harassed Mr Cashman with hundreds of text messages, and 
demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for a medical procedure.

She allegedly threatened to contact 
the press and his family with claims that would hurt his personal 
relationships and professional standing, according to a court complaint.

Mr Cashman made two payments, one for $4,000 and another for $2,000.

He even tried to get rid of his alleged mistress by urging her mother to have her committed, sources told the Daily News.

He apparently contacted Ms Meanwell last week and told her that her daughter was mentally unstable and 'needs help'.

The call led to a meeting between Ms Meanwell, Mr Cashman and his lawyer.

Prior accusations: Mr Cashman is not the first man to accuse her of stalking and making threats

'He told the mother she needed help,' one of the sources said. 'He suggested to her that she try to have her committed.'

In the meeting, Mr Cashman and Ms 
Meanwell placed a conference call to Louise’s Manhattan psychiatrist, 
Charlotte Murphy, who agreed with Cashman, sources told the Post.

'Murphy agreed that Louise was dangerous and violent, and that it was a serious situation. She said to call 911,' a source said.

Ms Meanwell made the call which eventually led to her daughter's arrest.

The Daily News also obtained a reference letter Mr Cashman wrote for Ms Neathway on Yankees-letterhead paper.

In the letter dated July 15, 2011, Mr
Cashman said that he had known her for six years through charity work 
and described her as 'tireless' contributor who had the 'respect and 
admiration' of her colleagues.

In court Ms Neathway's lawyers said 
Mr Cashman was 'a married man having an inappropriate relationship' with
Neathway, a medical sales worker, and he turned on her when it 'ended 
badly'.

She is also reported to have claimed 
to several friends that she had a year-long affair with Mr Cashman which
she ended after he did not fulfill a promise to leave his wife.

Ms Neathway has a criminal history of harassment and trespassing going back to 1988 and spanning three states.
