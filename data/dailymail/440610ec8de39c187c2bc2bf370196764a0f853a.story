Accidental death: Surranna Stonestreet died in May after she was hit by a falling wall from a shed her father was dismantling

A four-year-old was killed when a garden shed her father was dismantling collapsed and fell on her, an inquest heard.

Surranna Stonestreet, from Bath, Somerset, suffered fatal head injuries when she was hit by six breeze blocks that crashed down from the six-foot high wall.

Father Karl Stonestreet looked round to find his daughter laying under six breeze blocks with blood pouring from her mouth. He thought she'd been playing on a tampoline nearby.

He scooped up his daughter and ran into the house screaming at friends to call an ambulance but she died later in hospital.

In a statement read to the hearing, Mr Stonestreet said he intended to take down and rebuild the shed, built by his brother-in-law, as the front wall was not straight.

He said: 'The chisel got stuck by the door of the breeze block wall.

'At that point that wall suddenly fell towards me.'

Mr Stonestreet said he stepped backwards to avoid the falling rubble and fell over.

'As I got up I could see that Surranna was lying to the side of me.

'She had six breeze blocks on her chest. She had blood coming from her mouth.'

Mr Stonestreet picked up his daughter and rushed her inside the house, where wife Nicola, a full-time mother, administered CPR.

Tragic: Police described Surranna's death as a 'tragic accident'. Flowers were left in the garden where the four-year-old was killed

'When Nicky was working on Surranna she did begin to take some breaths,' he added.

Paramedics
arrived five minutes later and took Surranna to Bath's Royal United 
Hospital (RUH), where she was pronounced dead at 4.35pm.

The inquest was told Surranna's uncle, John Copp, a self-employed ground worker, built the wall in March 2011.

Mr
Copp said the wall was six feet high and 10 feet long and comprised of a
breeze block front, asbestos sides and a corrugated metal roof.

'As far as I am concerned I built a solid structure and that was how I left it,' Mr Copp said.

'At Christmas 2012 my brother told me the shed I built had the roof taken off and was a skeleton.

'In my opinion, this would have made the shed unstable.

Surranna's father was planning to dismantle and then rebuild the back-garden shed at their family home

'I have been devastated by the death of my niece Surranna.'

Mr Copp said the Stonestreet family moved from Bridgend in Wales to the semi-detached home in October 2012.

Detective Sergeant Birt, of Avon and Somerset Police told the inquest at Flax Bourton Coroner's Court: 'During this investigation I have not found any concerning or suspicious circumstances.

'This would appear to be a tragic accident.'

Maria Voisin, Coroner for Avon, concluded that Surranna - whose family did not attend the inquest - had died an 'accidental death' on May 3.

She extended her condolences to the family who were not present at the inquest.

After the tragedy, Mrs Stonestreet paid tribute to her daughter on a Facebook page called 'Nicola & Surranna Stonestreet'.

Mrs Stonestreet wrote: 'R.I.P baby ur going to be sooooo missed u were my world. Now sleeping with the angels love u darling XXXX.'
