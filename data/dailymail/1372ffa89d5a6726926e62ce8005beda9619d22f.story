A church-going 83-year-old widow has 
been handed a suspended jail sentence for 'waging psychological warfare'
on her soldier neighbour and his young family after a football landed 
in her garden.

In a shocking campaign of harassment, 
'vile' pensioner Ethel Watkins – known as The Duchess on her middle-class estate because of her smart dress and aloofness – 'visited mental torture' on the sergeant 
major, his wife, and their two sons after they moved in next door.

Watkins branded them 'scum' and 
'hooligans', deprived the youngsters of sleep by repeatedly banging on 
the walls, and made up foul-mouthed songs about the family.

'Vile': 83 year-old Ethel Watkins leaves Loughborough Magistrates Court today after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order and told she may face jail

The great-grandmother, a member of the
Royal British Legion's Women's Section for 66 years before she was 
kicked out for the offences, even set off her own burglar alarm to 
disturb the peace.

She also taunted the young mother about the loss of a 
six-month-old baby and said she hoped her husband 'wouldn't come back 
from Afghanistan' following a tour of duty.

In a bid to stop the abuse, Watkins 
was given a five-year restraining order in July last year preventing her
from contacting the family, who cannot be named for legal reasons, or 
any visitors to their home in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

She was handed the ban, and a fine, 
after admitting a charge of harassment at Loughborough Magistrates' 
Court, and was told she had only just escaped jail because of her age.

But incredibly, Watkins ignored the 
warning, and was arrested again within 24 hours of her court appearance 
for resuming her reign of terror on the quiet residential street.

Harassment: Ethel Watkins, 83, launched a shocking campaign against a young family after a child's football landed in her garden

Watkins pleaded not guilty to 
breaching the restraining order on four separate occasions - even 
claiming that she was singing hymns instead of being abusive.

But JPs at the same court rejected her denials and convicted her of the offences last December.

Chairman of the bench Ben Faust adjourned sentence so psychiatric reports into Watkin's mental state could be prepared.

Lisa O'Driscoll, defending, said 
medical reports showed Watkins was suffering from the early stages of 
dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and claimed this explained much of her
erratic behaviour.

But Mr Faust said it was clear Watkins 'retained the capacity to know right from wrong'.

He added: 'Your actions had a 
significant impact on the children living next door to you. The family 
were victimised by you to such an extent they had to leave home.'

Mr Faust told Watkins that if the 
family had remained at home, she would have been sent to prison because 
it would have been the court's duty to protect them from further harm.

Instead, she was given a 26-week jail 
term, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay the family £2,000 in 
compensation, as well as prosecution costs of £620.

She was also reminded by magistrates that the existing five-year restraining order remained in place.

At an earlier hearing, the court heard
the family, who now live in Cyprus where the Sgt Maj is based, moved in
next to Watkins in 2011 wanting to make a 'fresh start' after the loss 
of their baby, and initially got on well with their new neighbour.

The mother even confided in Watkins, 
who lives alone, about the death of the child - but the relationship 
turned sour after a ball the children were playing with landed in 
Watkins' garden.

Carol Huston, prosecuting, said the 
trouble then escalated rapidly, with Watkins setting off her own burglar
alarm to prevent the children from sleeping.

Abusive: The pensioner would pass the house ans swear at the house, as well as sing vile songs and abuse her neighbour about the death of her baby and that she hoped her husband would be killed in action

The hearing was told Watkins, who had 
lived in her semi-detached home since 1991, would regularly insult the 
mother with songs she had made up.

Mrs Huston added: 'She would repeat 
over and over things like "You are poison, you are evil, you won't win, 
go back to where you came from, you are nothing but a tramp".'

Mrs Huston said that on occasions, the taunts referred to the dead child.

She said: 'Watkins would shout words similar to, "What kind of life would the child have had if it lived?"'

The family were asked by police to log
every incident to build up a dossier of evidence against Watkins. 
Pictures the family took included the widow, who lives alone, flashing a
V sign as she passed their home.

She was eventually arrested and 
appeared in court on July 25 last year, where she admitted harassment 
and was given the restraining order. However, just a day later Watkins committed her first breach.

Watkins went on to commit three 
further breaches of the restraining order in early September. She made 
retching noises at the family, called the mother 'scum', and insulted 
the children.

After Watkins was found guilty of the breaches, victim impact statements from the family were read out.

One female magistrate wept as the 
court heard how Watkins' behaviour had left the mother 'depressed, 
exhausted, and on the verge of a breakdown'.

In her statement, she said Watkins had
waged 'psychological warfare against her and her family', adding she 
was 'barely able to function without the support of her wider family'.

In a new statement read before Watkins
was sentenced, her husband asked the court what steps would be taken to
protect his family from her when they return to the UK in two years' 
time.

He added it would be very difficult to sell their home, as he would feel 'honour bound' to tell potential buyers about Watkins.
