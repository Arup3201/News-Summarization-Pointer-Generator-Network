Driver: Marian Guerrido, 23, managed to get out of the car safely before it plunged into the pond

Two children have died and three are in a critical condition after their unlicensed mother lost control of the family car and drove it into a pond  in suburban Minneapolis.

The Minnesota State Patrol identified the children as Aliyana Rennie, one; Zenavia Rennie, five; Amani Coleman-Guerrido, five; Zarihana Rennie, six; and Alarious Coleman-Guerrido, seven.

Rescuers worked frantically to free the children after their family car veered off a highway ramp and into the frigid pond shortly after 6am Thursday.

The car was underwater for up to 45 minutes after Thursday's crash. St. Louis Park city spokesman Jamie Zwilling said the children were unconscious and unresponsive when pulled from the vehicle.

Zenavia Rennie of Brooklyn Center, was pronounced dead at around 7.30pm Thursday.

An attorney acting as the family spokesman told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that Alarious Coleman-Guerrido passed away before 10pm at Hennepin County Medical Center.

The driver, Marion Guerrido, 23, of Brooklyn Center, escaped from the four-door 1998 Pontiac Grand Am sedan and was unhurt.

Still in a critical condition are Amani Coleman-Guerrido, Zarihanna Rennie and Aliyana Rennie.

Three of the children are Guerrido’s - Alarious, who died; Amani, and baby Aliyana. Aliyana’s father, Julius Rennie, is Guerrido’s boyfriend. Zenavia was Rennie’s daughter, as are Zarihana and Aliyana.

One witness described seeing her in the pond, screaming for help.

‘The car was under water, and she must have been standing on top,' Jeff Robertson told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. ‘That pond is 8 or 9 feet deep, and the water was at her knees.’

The children could not be rescued until the car was towed out of the water and police could reach the doors.

Passersby attempted to rescue the children before police arrived, but the 1998 Pontiac Grand Am was submerged in cold water.

The
 cold water came up to the neck of one would-be rescuer who stood on the
 roof of the four-door sedan, said Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Eric 
Roeske.

St Louis Park spokesman Jamie Zwilling said Miss Guerrido, of Brooklyn Center, escaped
 the car when it hit the water, but the first child was pulled out of 
the car after 25 minutes, the last after 45 minutes, Minnesota State 
Patrol confirmed.

The pond was near freezing, police said.

Passengers: Authorities say five children were 
trapped in the car underwater for about 20 minutes and are said to be 
unresponsive

Four of the five children, including 
the two deceased, attended the Odyssey Academy, where little Zenavia had
 recently been named a star student.

Teacher Laura Montrey told MyFox9 that the kids' mother was very involved with her brood's education.

The crash happened about 6:16am at the 
junction of Highways 7 and 100 in St Louis Park, a western Minneapolis 
suburb.

It is not yet known how fast the car - a green Pontiac Grand Am -
 was going.

Lt Eric Roeske said the car veered 
left off a ramp and plunged down a slope into the pond about 40 to 50 
yards from the roadway. There is no guardrail between the road and the 
pond.

He told the Star Tribune the car landed in water that was 'quite deep', an estimated eight to nine feet, and was 'incredibly cold'.

'A passerby who jumped in the water was standing on the roof of the vehicle and the water was up to his neck,' Roeske said.

All victims were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center and the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children’s Hospital.

Asked to comment on whether the crash could have been intentional, Roeske said they were planning to fully investigate the incident, but there was no immediate information that would indicate the crash had happened on purpose.

Police say they are still looking into how the kids all fit in the four-door sedan and if any of them were wearing seat belts.

The officers and firefighters who jumped into the water have revealed that they had to use their feet to pull the kids out of the car

Crash: The children were not able to be rescued from the car until it was towed out of the water

The city fire department and the Hennepin County dive team worked to get the car out. she said it wasn't clear whether speed was a factor in the crash.

The road was wet from light mist, but not icy, he said.

Jeffrey Robertson, who lives in an apartment building close to the pond, said he heard a woman screaming as he was watching the morning news on TV.

He ran onto his second-floor balcony and saw a woman standing in water that was up to her knees, he told the Star Tribune. He then called 911 before running out to help the woman.
