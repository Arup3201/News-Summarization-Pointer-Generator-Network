61-year-old Hastings has been charged by British police authorities on 12 counts of sexual violation 

He was arrested  at the school where he worked in the Kumphawapi district in Udon Thani, in Thailand

Pariwat Satchaphan, an immigration inspector in Nongkhai province, said: 'He has been charged by British police authorities for indecent actions - 12 accounts - to children under 14 years old.' 

The Briton was sent to Bangkok where a court will decide whether or not to extradite him.

Hastings denied the accusations against him at a news conference at the Immigration Detention Centre in Bangkok.

'Why am I being arrested in England? And I'm happy to go back and find out. I know I have done nothing wrong,' he said.

The 61-year-old told police that he had arrived in Thailand in 2005 and has a Thai wife, the Bangkok Post reported.

He was employed by the school until at least next March, the newspaper added.

A spokesman for the British embassy in Bangkok confirmed the arrest and said consular officials were providing assistance.
