Liverpool fans would never forgive Steven Gerrard if he moved to a Premier League rival, according to Jamie Carragher.

But the Kop legend is confident his former team-mate will thrash out a new deal and remain at Anfield beyond the end of the season.

Gerrard is out of contract at the end of the campaign and has no plans to retire, with Manchester City and New York Cosmos already linked with a move for the Reds skipper.

However, Carragher says the 34-year-old could wreck his legendary status among Liverpool fans if he quit for another English club.

'No, I don't think they would [forgive him],' Carragher told Monday Night Football, 'but I don't think Steven Gerrard would move to another [English] club. 

'He's a local lad. If he moved on I think it would be abroad, maybe the States or Europe. I think they will get it all sorted out in the next couple of weeks.'

Gerrard has spent his entire career on Merseyside after progressing through the club's youth system, racking up almost 700 appearances for the Reds.
