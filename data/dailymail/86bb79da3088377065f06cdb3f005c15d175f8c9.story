The question crowding in on Lewis Hamilton as he lost further ground in the World Championship battle is whether he has any card to play other than his sheer, natural genius as a driver.

His voice was thin and meek after he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, the calculating German who is threatening to win the title by small margins of Teutonic precision.

Hamilton 
had driven beautifully here at the Red Bull Ring in the rolling hills of
 green countryside, threading his car through the pack from ninth on the
 starting grid to zoom into fourth place on the first lap alone, en 
route to a second-place finish behind Rosberg.

But
 it is when cool calculation is needed that Hamilton is lacking against 
the cerebral, icy Rosberg. For example, in qualifying on Saturday, 
Hamilton spun — ‘maybe I pushed the brake pedal too hard,’ he said — and
 had one lap wiped because he ran off the track at Turn Eight.

Rosberg
 was inch-perfect, so much so that the stewards spent half an hour 
studying an image that suggested he, too, had put all four wheels off 
the tarmac at the same corner. They gave him the benefit of the doubt.

Round the bend: Pole-sitter Felipe Massa led the pack into turn 1 but ultimately finished in fourth

So
 Rosberg started from third with the Williams cars of Felipe Massa and 
Valtteri Bottas surprisingly starting on the front row.  Rosberg said he
 had been slowed a fraction by Hamilton’s excursion off the asphalt. The
 marginally superior pace of Rosberg’s Mercedes allowed him to force his
 way into the lead in the 15th of the 71 laps. The win gives him a 
29-point lead going into Hamilton’s home race at Silverstone on Sunday 
week.

Bizarrely,
 Rosberg was asked afterwards whether, if he won the title, he would 
grow a moustache to resemble that of his father Keke, the 1982 champion.
 He said he might.

The
 similarities are growing: Keke was a pugnacious character and Nico, for
 all his blond looks that won him the moniker ‘Britney’, as in Spears, 
is showing a hard-edged pursuit of  perfection that is not so obvious in
 his rival.

Costly: Hamilton lost almost two seconds to team-mate Rosberg during the two round of pit-stops

This
 weekend had echoes of the last race in Canada. Hamilton erred in 
qualifying, surrendering pole to Rosberg. That allowed the German to 
nurse the technical glitches that blighted both Mercedes from the front 
while Hamilton pushed his car until it retired hurt.

The
 British driver was hindered by two slow pit stops yesterday but, again,
 his own minute error was a factor. He admitted he went ‘a bit long’ — 
fractionally beyond the ideal pit-box stopping place — on his first 
visit to the pits.

A
 problem with a cracked wheel rim delayed him in the second stop. It 
cost him 1.9sec compared to Rosberg. That was almost exactly the margin 
by which the pair were separated at the end. ‘Valuable, but it would not
 have put me first,’ said Hamilton. ‘There is not much more I can do. I 
have good pace. I just need to execute it.’

So close: Hamilton pushed team-mate Rosberg right to the chequered flag but came up short in Austria

Talent: Hamilton battled well to come from ninth position to earn a second spot finish

Peace: Hamilton finished second in Austria

It
 was noticeable that Mercedes were not as dominant as in the past. Lauda
 said there would be a meeting at the factory in Brackley this week to 
analyse how to re-establish their hegemony. The fast Silverstone layout 
should suit their super-powerful engine.

Toto
 Wolff, Mercedes’ executive director, has another job: trying to get the
 garage’s two sides working collaboratively. ‘The playing field must be 
kept equal,’ he said. ‘On Saturday, the atmosphere wasn’t like in the 
races before. We see it’s getting very competitive.

‘We
 need the knowledge of the whole group, not only the drivers but the 
engineers on both sides of the garage. It’s not about  winning the next 
couple of races but staying competitive in the next couple of years.’

Williams, a team who deserve some respite, took third and fourth through Bottas and Massa.

Red Bull had the indignity on their own track of only one finisher from their team and their subsidiary Toro Rosso.

Christian
 Horner, Red Bull’s team chief, said of engine suppliers Renault: 
‘Reliability is unacceptable, performance is unacceptable. There needs 
to be change at Renault.’
