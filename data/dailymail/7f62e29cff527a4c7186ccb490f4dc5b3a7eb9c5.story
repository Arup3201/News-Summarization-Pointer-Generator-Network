Two men who have devoted the past six years of their lives to rescuing koalas have reportedly been banned from Terri Irwin's Australia Zoo after asking her not to lean on their car.

Twin brothers Ray and Murray Chambers were regular volunteers at the wildlife park in Queensland and helped save 500 koalas last year.

Their fight with Terri, the widow of Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, happened after Murray mentioned she was leaning on his car as she wrote something down, The Sunday Mail reports.

Fight: Terri Irwin reportedly fell out with two volunteers at Australia Zoo after they mentioned she was leaning on their car

Murray, who is the co-founder of Sunshine Coast Koala Rescue, had just signed in a koala to be cared for by Australia Zoo Hospital when the argument kicked off.

The brothers are now not allowed to escort harmed koalas into the hospital, after they previously helped out at the rescue centre one or two days a week.

'We're trying to negotiate to see if we can get back in there. It's a pretty sad event,' Ray told MailOnline on Sunday.

He said they were banned 'four or five weeks ago'.

'It's going to impact us taking them in there and getting them into triage,' he added.

Ray and Murray also issued a statement via their charity Sunshine Coast Koala Wildlife Rescue that confirmed they are not allowed to enter the driveway of the hospital and have had their volunteering duties axed.

Terri and Steve Irwin took over the 100-acre zoo, which is located on the Sunshine Coast, in 1992 after its previous owners Bob and Lyn - Steve's parents - retired.

In 2004, the couple opened the Australian Zoo Wildlife Hospital next to the zoo to help with animal care and rehabilitation.

Since Steve was killed on 4 September 2006, when he was pierced in the chest by a stingray barb while filming a documentary, Terri has continued to run the zoo.

In 2012, koalas were listed by the Australian Government as vulnerable in Queensland.

Ray and Murray first got involved with koala rescue and the zoo six years ago as a charitable sideline to their mechanics business, WB Motors in Caloundra.

It now plays a huge part in their lives.

In February, Ray spoke out about how the struggling koala population could be extinct within five years.

He explained that more than a dozen koalas had been killed on the Coast in the past six months.

'In peak times, we get called out to one koala rescue a day, sometimes two,' he told The Reporter.

He also warned that as well as the usual threats - including sickness, loss of habitat and being hit by cars - koalas now have to look out for feral dogs and cows.

'Wild dogs are playing a big part now... They're a menace, taking everything - possums, birds, koalas, they're probably taking people's pets in their own yard,' he said.

Koalas are already extinct in some parts of Queensland.

'At the end of the day we're losing the fight,' Ray warned.

MailOnline has contacted Australia Zoo for comment.
