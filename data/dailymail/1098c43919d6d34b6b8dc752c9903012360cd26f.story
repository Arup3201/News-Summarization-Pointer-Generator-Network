Josie Cunningham has said she will inform the father of her baby in a Christmas card

NHS boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham has said she will reveal the identity of her baby's father to him on Christmas Day, it has been reported.

The 24-year-old asked three men to take a paternity test to determine which one could be three-month-old Grace's father - and she plans to write the outcome in their Christmas card.

She expects to find out the truth in two weeks and claims all three men will receive a card late on Christmas Eve, but only one will have a copy of the test results.

The mother-of-three shot to notoriety when she boasted about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS and then threatened to have an abortion so she could appear in Big Brother.

She told the Sunday Mirror: 'How to tell all three men has been a really hard decision but, as it's Christmas I thought it would be a really nice surprise for Grace's dad to find out on Christmas Day. 

'I feel that whoever the father is, he should be pleased that he has had such a beautiful daughter with me.'

The wannabe model from Leeds, West Yorkshire, has arranged for a friend to put the cards through all three of the potential fathers front doors late on Christmas Eve.

She will also change her mobile number and the card being posted to Grace's father will be the only one which contains her new one.

Josie added: 'Whichever man it is he's a lucky chap. Not only does he have a beautiful daughter but he got to have a wild night between the sheets with me.'

At one point, the former glamour model thought the child's father could be Hull City captain Curtis Davis, but it was later revealed that she had been duped.

The man, who she began sleeping with after meeting him at a Leicester hotel in April last year, had allegedly told her he was the £2.2million central defender.

Friends had warned her it might not be him but she still fell for it, even after searching for pictures of the real footballer on Google.

Writing on Twitter at the time she said: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer.'

She has sent off for a DNA test for two of the men - one of which is a surgeon she slept with whilst working as a £1,000-a-night prostitute. The other is her best friend's boyfriend and the third is the Curtis Davis 'look-a-like'

The other two contenders for the possible father include a surgeon she slept with whilst working as a £1,000-a-night prostitute and her best friend's boyfriend.

She has split the cost of the £300 DNA test between two of the men, with the footballer impostor refusing to give a sample, and says if they aren't the father they will get their money back. 

However, she believes it is unlikely the conman will be the father because Grace is 'light-skinned', she told the paper. 

Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. 

The 24-year-old has sparked fury recently among mothers after saying breastfeeding was 'borderline incest'

And the former escort, who already has two sons aged six and three, only stopped smoking and drinking when she found out her unborn child was a longed-for girl. 

She also said she would attempt to sell tickets for £10,000 to watch the live birth of her daughter.

And recently the single mother sparked fury among mothers after saying breastfeeding was 'vile and borderline incest'.

Josie has now embarked on her next venture - a string of websites to encourage girls to 'get pregnant and live on benefits'. 

The young mother, who has just moved from her council house in Leeds to a bigger one in a village 20 miles away - has launched WantKidsNow.com, which allows women to arrange unprotected sex sessions.

She has also set up easysingles.co.uk, for people seeking casual sex, and pullthepig.com, aimed at average looking girls, The Sun reports.

She told the paper: 'People will think I'm promoting unprotected sex so women can get pregnant, bag themselves a council house and have a life on benefits.

'But it's really no different to what many girls have on a Saturday night. Parents gain more points in many councils' scoring system so having a child definitely helps.'

Josie compared herself to '2014's answer to Cilla Black' and reckons the sites will turn over £800,000 a month. 

Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.

Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job.

Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery.

But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. 

The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy.

She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'.

Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child.

Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000.

It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.
