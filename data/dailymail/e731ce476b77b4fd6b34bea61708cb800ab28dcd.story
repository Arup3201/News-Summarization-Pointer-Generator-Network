Sunrise co-host Andrew O'Keefe has defended his on-air argument with a Herald Sun columnist branding those who argue Muslims are not doing anything to combat extremism as 'ignorant'.

O'Keefe and Rita Panahi went head-to-head on Monday morning over the role of Islam in the recent Paris terror attacks.

Rita Panahi told the Seven Network breakfast show that Muslims should 'start discussing intelligently and meaningfully' the links between their community and Islamic extremists - including ISIS.

The discussion between Panahi, O'Keefe, his co-host Samantha Armytage and Radio 4BC's Patrick Condren then became clearly heated when O'Keefe claimed Muslims were no more responsible for the actions of Islamic extremists than Christians were for attacks carried out by fundamentalists.

O'Keefe went on to cite attacks on abortion clinics and the Oslo massacre carried out by Anders Breivik as examples of terror that were not more broadly linked to Christianity - and at one point produced his phone to help prove his point.

The Sunrise co-host stood his ground on Monday afternoon, while acknowledging that the issue was not about taking sides but about peace. 

'Let me make it very clear…I in no way support the acts of unspeakable terror perpetrated by Muslim extremists. Or any other acts of violent extremism perpetrated falsely in the name of any God. This is not a matter of taking sides….it's about standing up for peace,' O'Keefe told Daily Mail Australia.

'My point to Rita was primarily that we ARE talking about this, and moderate Muslim leaders in Australia ARE seeking to combat extremism. Check out the work of Jamal Rifi, or Kuranda Seyit, or Samier Dandan, or the mufti himself. 

'To pretend that Muslims are not engaged in the debate about extremism is just ignorant. Australia's Muslim leaders have been vocal about ISIS, about Martin Place, and about Paris, condemning those acts as crimes against Islam and humanity, and talking about the kinds of actions Australia's Muslims are undertaking at the grassroots to combat extremism.

'To claim that they need to "step up" ignores the fact that they're stepping up already. 

'How heartbreaking it must be to constantly defend your religion against the actions of those who seek to misuse it for evil,' the co-host said. 

Rita Panahi also stood by her comments, but admitted she was 'taken aback' by the fierce turn the conversation took.

'I think Andrew inadvertently proved the point that I was making in the article which is this eagerness to make excuses,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

The columnist also said her words were misinterpreted adding: 'What Andrew was claiming I was saying I wasn't actually saying... I'm not seeking the blame the greater community for the claims of the extremists.'

While the debate was ongoing co-host Samantha Armytage (left in left image) kept quiet as did other guest Patrick Condren (bottom right)

Panahi said O'Keefe's argument that many members of other religions committing 'such atrocities' was irrelevant as 'it's 2015 and Islam falls at the centre.'

'There's no point worrying about what happened 300 years ago even 30 years ago,' she said adding that it was important to recognise what is happening now.

'We need to start discussing intelligently and meaningfully the issues we have with the Muslim community,' Panahi began in the Sunrise segment, citing the angle she took in an article published on Monday morning.

The columnist continued by saying that a discussion needs to be ignited about why such acts of terror are occurring, adding 'they quite clearly have everything to do with Islam'.

Panahi then asked: 'What can we do to bring the Muslim community into the mainstream even more' before O'Keefe cut her off.

At one point O'Keefe took out this phone to look up an answer to one of Panahi's questions and prove his point

'But we're already discussing this - we've been discussing it for a long time Rita and every time a bunch of fundamentalist Christians in the United States bomb an abortion clinic or bomb a synagogue do we hold every Christian in the world to account for that?' O'Keefe argued.

Panahi deemed his argument 'nonsensical' before O'Keefe then accused his guest of 'holding the majority responsible for the actions of a very small minority'.

She argued that she was not doing that, and insisted that it was time to stop pretending Islam was like any other religion, suggesting instead that it was the only such one at the centre of any act of terror around the world. 

While this debate was raging co-host Samantha Armytage didn't say a word while the other guest Patrick Condren sat looking rather amused at the conversation. 

Panahi and O'Keefe continued the debate about what classified an act of terror with O'Keefe firmly standing his ground over the fact that not only Muslims were committing such acts, again referencing the bombing of abortion clinics in America.

At many stages during the debate O'Keefe cut off Panahi 

When asked by Panahi when the last time such an event took place the Sunrise co-host admitted 'off the top of his head' he wasn't sure but vowed to find out picking up his phone to search online. 

Condren was eventually bought into the conversation and described the issue as 'very emotional' before declaring 'I've got to say, I'm in the Andrew camp.'

'Where was this conversation when the IRA were bombing England and parts if Ireland on the basis of their Catholic religion?' the radio host asked.

'It think it's very very easy to marginalise Muslims because people don't understand the religion ... and it's too easy to marginalise them when you've got the prime minister of Australia saying he finds the burqa "very confronting",' Condren added.

Panahi then weighed back in asking her fellow guest if he found that burqa confronting to which he said 'Rita I don't find it confronting in any way shape or form.

'I’m not that narrow-minded,' Condren added.

Panahi asked Condren if he found the burqa confronting, to which he replied he didn't and he was not that narrow-minded 

The conversation wrapped up with O'Keefe stating that the last attack on an abortion clinic was in 2009 as co-host Samantha tried to finish up the segment.

Since the heated debate Twitter has been alight with conversation about the discussion, with viewers weighing in passionately on both sides.

Even Panahi tried to keep the conversation going, tweeting about the exchange following her appearance.

'Interesting discussion on @sunriseon7 according to Andrew O'Keefe Islam extremists are no bigger problem than extremes of others religions,' she wrote.

It's that type of wilful blindness that has categorised the debate thus far', Panahi said in another post.
