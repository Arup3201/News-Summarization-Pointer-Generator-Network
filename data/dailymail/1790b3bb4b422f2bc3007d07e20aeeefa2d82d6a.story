Justine Miliband has dismissed the media storm around the 'two kitchens' debate by saying there is more important things in politics than their home.

In an interview with The Guardian, the Labour leader's wife, known professionally as Justine Thornton, said that the media storm surrounding which kitchen she and her husband, Ed, used in their north London home was not what mattered in politics. 

'Ed's grandad died because of politics. He met people who were assassinated because of politics,' she said.

'There is a really, really serious side to politics and there is this other side. I just don't see the point in getting worried about it.

'Or you just have a sense of humour about it. At the end of the day, none of that is that important. There are really serious issues and it is down to people to make a choice about what they see as serious.'

The great kitchen debate started after it emerged Ed Miliband, posing for a cup of tea with  Justine, had plumped for the photograph in the smaller of his two kitchens.

He insisted he preferred his 'functional kitchenette' - complete with a hob, two ovens and a sink - while a family friend revealed it was mainly used for 'tea and quick snacks'.

The bland room, painted white with a grey floor, looked cold and rather dingy compared to the kitchens at the Prime Minister's two homes.

David Cameron's kitchen at his Oxfordshire home was seen as far more bright and airy, with plenty of room to prepare meals

But the environmental law barrister said the shade of the kitchen was not important, while pledging to take a more vocal position than than most leaders' wives.

She said: 'I'm looking forward to getting out and talking to voters, and to first-time voters in particular.'
