Two boys were found dead in the basement of a home Friday with three handguns surrounding their lifeless bodies.

Friends Taylor Wheeler, 12, and Dayton Gessell, 15, were discovered minutes after gunshots rang out in the Daybreak suburb of South Jordan, Utah.

Neither boy lived in the home, and police have given few details about how the devastating shooting occurred. Investigators are awaiting autopsy results.

'This is a tragedy. The family's devastated. We really don't have any words to say. It's hard, very hard. These kids were so young with so much life ahead of them,' Shawn Graham, Dayton's uncle, told the Deseret News.

An off duty policeman driving by the home discovered the Copper Mountain Middle School students' bodies at around 4:30 p.m. after another boy who was at the residence at the time ran onto the street and waved him down.

The policeman then called South Jordan police who have been investigating the scene.

Authorities have been unable to confirm where the guns came from, who owns them and even if they were used in the shooting.

Three boys - aged 16, 14, and 14 - who were in the house when the shots were fired were taken to the police station but not questioned, according to the Deseret News. All three were released to their parents. Police said they were confident were are no outstanding suspects.

'There should be no concern for the citizens that there's someone around with weapons or harm to their neighborhood,' South Jordan police Sgt. Sam Winkler said.

The boys' family and friends held a vigil for them Sunday night and more than 100 people turned out to remember the students and support their loved ones.

Dayton was described as an incredible young man who loved baseball and wanted to be an engineer.

While Taylor was a fun-loving kid who enjoyed making people laugh.

Taylor's friend Drew Francom left a dollar bill on a picnic table for his pal.

He said he was looking for change recently and asked Taylor, but at the moment the boy did not have money. Then later at lunch, Taylor found Drew again and gave him the dollar he needed.

'I never got to pay him back,' Francom said. 'So I brought him a dollar.'

Graham said his nephew was clever and had an exciting future ahead of him.

'(Dayton) was amazing with math. You could throw him a math problem and he didn't have to write it down. He could just hammer it out,' he said.

Taylor's mother, Charl√© Meier, told the Salt Lake Tribune the vigil was important because everyone who knew and loved her son and Dayton needed somewhere to be together and deal with the sudden loss.

Crying, and holding her two daughters close, she said: 'We're lighting candles for lights extinguished too soon. They were just boys.'

Later, Meier stood on a picnic table and passed around notebooks so people could write down messages for the boys.

'Nobody got to say goodbye,' she said.
