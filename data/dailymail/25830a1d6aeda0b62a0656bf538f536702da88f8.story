A new study has revealed the surprising truths behind the primary concerns of newly pregnant women in 20 different countries around the world, based on their most common Google searches.

The first things women in the U.S. want to know when they fall pregnant are ‘how to prevent stretch marks' and ‘how to lose weight', according to the data.

The study, compiled by Google data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz for The New York Times, found that while English and Australian women have the exact some body priorities as Americans, the most common search for expectant mothers in South Africa, India and Nigeria is 'how to have sex.'

First concerns: New Google data has revealed that the most common search made by newly pregnant women in the U.S. is 'how to lose weight and prevent stretch marks', but for South Africans, Indians and Nigerians, it's 'how to have sex'

The top five concerns, in order of popularity for women in the U.S. according to the data are: 'Prevent stretch marks, lose weight, have sex, avoid stretch marks and stay fit.' This order was very similar in Britain and Australia. Absent from these top five concerns, but cropping up in other countries are 'take care' in India, 'stay healthy' in Nigeria, and 'stop vomiting' in South Africa.

Google's data unearthed a treasure trove of further facts about how various cultures around the world shape women's priorities so differently, while in some cases, culture seems irrelevant.

All women tend to crave the same things for example, regardless of where they live. In the U.S. the top search is 'craving ice', followed by salt, sweets, fruit and then spicy food. This is almost exactly the same in all the countries addressed.

Career boost: The American fixation on snapping back into shape after giving birth is reflected in stars like Kim Kardashian (left) and Jessica Simpson (right) who both publicly promoted their post-baby diets 

As for the Google search: 'Can pregnant women...?' It's food and drink related questions which top almost every list. But the food types vary. American and British women query the safety of shrimp and prawns, Australians wonder whether they can eat 'cream cheese', Indians search 'pizza', Singaporeans search 'green tea', Mexicans search 'coffee' and oddly, Nigerians search 'cold water.'

Other queries that crop up across the board, are from women wondering if they can fly, take pain relief, and drink alcohol.

Brazilian women stick out tremendously, seemingly unconcerned by what they should be consuming, and search only for whether they can dye their hair, ride a bike and fly. And the fifth most common search in Mexico is whether pregnant women can wear heels.

Surprisingly, in every country examined, the most common dream people Google is overwhelmingly: 'I dreamed I was pregnant', after 'having babies, cheating on a partner, killing someone, dying, and winning the lottery'.

Which appears to neatly summarize the whole of humankind and what we're thinking about while we spend nearly half our lives asleep.

And surely the most depressing conclusion the study arrived at - for American women at least - are the top searches made by men soon after they find out their wives are pregnant.

In Mexico, it's 'words of love' and 'poems for my pregnant wife'. In the U.S., it's: 'My wife is pregnant what do I do' and 'my wife is pregnant now what'.
