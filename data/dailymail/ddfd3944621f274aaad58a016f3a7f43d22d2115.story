A car bomb tore through a crowded bazaar killing at least 17 people in north-western Pakistan today.

A further 40 people were injured in the blast outside an office for anti-Taliban tribal elders that destroyed local shops and nearby parked cars.

The strike in the town of Darra Adam Khel is the latest to hit the troubled area near the Afghan border showing militants still pose a threat to the stability of Pakistan despite government offensives against the Taliban and their supporters.

Destruction: Pakistani security officials inspect the wreckage of a destroyed vehicle at the site of a bomb attack in Darra Adam Khel

Rubble: Forty people were also injured in the blast that destroyed numerous shops and cars

No group immediately claimed responsibility, but the Pakistani Taliban have staged similar attacks in the tribal region of Darra Adam Khel to punish elders for backing security forces in offensives against militants.

The explosives-laden car was parked near the office of one of the so-called peace committees that have been formed by local elders trying to rid the area of militants.

Regional government administrator Fakhruddin Khan said it was unclear how many people were in the office at the time but those killed included tribal elders and passers-by.

He said 40 people were wounded and the attack destroyed 35 shops and eight vehicles.

Bystanders: Children were among those injured in the blast in Darra Adam Khel near to a local anti-insurgent peace committee office, which officials said was the target of the attack

The dead and wounded, including some in critical condition, had been transported to hospitals in the north-western city of Peshawar.

The region, which is in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, is famous for its weapons market selling guns made by local craftsmen.

Provincial Information Minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain blamed the Pakistani Taliban, noting the fundamentalist Islamic movement also had tried to kill a 14-year-old girl who is an advocate of education for girls and a critic of the Taliban.

Malala Yousufzai was shot and wounded by a Taliban gunman in the Swat Valley on Tuesday. The attack has drawn widespread condemnation.

Mr Hussain urged the federal government to consider launching a 'decisive operation against terrorists' to eliminate the militants.

'These Taliban have killed our innocent people in so many attacks. They are still killing our people.

Instead of wasting time, we should hit them back, and we should do it as early as possible to save the precious lives of our innocent girls like Malala Yousufzai,' he told reporters in Peshawar.
