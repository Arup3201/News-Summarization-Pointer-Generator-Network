A global fight against ISIS militants will likely take years to fully succeed, but nations are prepared to engage 'for as long as it takes' to defeat the bloody insurgency, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said today.

Nearly a year after the Islamic State overran key cities in western Iraq, diplomats from more than 60 counties and international organisations gathered in Brussels to plot a way forward against what has since become one of the world's worst terror threats.

'We recognise the hard work that remains to be done,' Kerry told the gathering at NATO headquarters, which hosted what was, to date, the largest meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the Islamic State. 

'Our commitment will be measured most likely in years, but our efforts are already having a significant impact. We will engage in this campaign for as long as it takes to prevail'.

His comments come as the Pentagon revealed Iran had join the fight against ISIS, launching airstrikes against militants in eastern Iraq.

'Our efforts are already having a significant impact': US Secretary of State John Kerry updates the media on the offensive against the Islamic State at a meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the terror group

A Pentagon spokesman said Tehran has targeted the terror group in recent days, but is not co-ordinating attacks with the U.S. and the UK and has not been invited to join the coalition.

The mostly Sunni Muslim insurgency now stretches across much of northern Iraq and Syria, attracting thousands of foreign fighters from around the world, including Europe. 

Its elusive leadership is flush with financial support from illicit donations and black-market oil sales. 

Kerry also met privately with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who asked for 'a lot of support to be able to crush Daesh' - the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.

'I think we're the only country in the Middle East who is really fighting Daesh on the ground,' al-Abadi said.

While at NATO, the Iraqi leader announced his country was submitting a formal request to the alliance to help improve its military capacities, NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said. 

The request will have to be reviewed by representatives of NATO's 28 member nations, she said.

'Anything that NATO might do in support of Iraq's defense-capacity building would need to be complementary to the considerable efforts already undertaken by the U.S.-led coalition and individual NATO allies,' Lungescu said.

Since August 8 - nearly two months after militants seized control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city - the U.S. and allies have launched more than 1,000 airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Kerry said the attacks have greatly hampered the insurgency and cited training missions and equipment being supplied by other nations that have joined the coalition since it was created less than three months ago.  

Meanwhile, Rear Admiral John Kirby said the U.S. believes this may be the first time Tehran has launched manned aircraft from inside Iran to strike targets in Iraq. 

The fight against ISIS has seen Tehran and the Washington set aside their customary hostility to battle a common enemy  which both governments view as a dangerous threat.

Earlier this week, an F-4 fighter, similar to those used by the Iranian air force, was filmed attacking targets in the eastern province of Diyala, and its nationality was confirmed by Pentagon yesterday.

'We have indications that they [Iran] did indeed fly air strikes with F-4 Phantoms in the past several days,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said.

Iranian forces have been active on the ground in Iraq assisting Shiite militia and Baghdad government units, but this was the first time the United States had confirmed the Iranian air force was conducting strikes against the IS group. 

Kirby said the United States was not coordinating with Iranian forces and that it was up to the Iraqi government to oversee military flights by different countries.

'We are flying missions over Iraq. We co-ordinate with the Iraqi government as we conduct those. It's up to the Iraqi government to deconflict that air space,' Kirby told reporters.

'Nothing has changed about our policy of not coordinating military activity with the Iranians.'

Shortly after Tehran's airstrikes were confirmed, Iran's ambassador to Yemen was targeted in a bomb attack in the capital of Sanaa. 

A car bomb detonated outside the residence of Ambassador Hassan Sayed Nam in Sanaa this morning, killing at least three people, security officials and witnesses said.

The ambassador was not in the house when the attack took place, and it  was not immediately clear whether the attack was in retaliation for Iran's airstrikes against ISIS.

It is also not known  if the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber or if the device was remotely detonated.

Shiite-ruled Iran has close ties to the Shia-led government in Baghdad, and Tehran quickly came to the government's aid after the Sunni jihadists overran Iraqi army units in western and northern Iraq earlier this year.

Iran also has provided weapons to Shi'ite fighters in Iraq and several fighter jets, amid widespread speculation that the planes are flown by Iranian pilots.

The commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, Major General Qassem Suleimani, led a counter-attack in Iraq over the summer that pushed back IS militants from a key route leading from Samarra to Baghdad, according to Lebanon's Shiite movement Hezbollah.

Even if there is no direct communication between Iranian and U.S. forces, the Americans likely would be aware and easily monitor flights over Iraq by Iran's less sophisticated air fleet, which uses a fighter jet that dates back to the Vietnam War

A US air command center in Qatar coordinates American fighters, bombers, drones and surveillance aircraft flying round-the-clock missions over Iraq along with other coalition warplanes from European governments as well as Australia and Canada.

The onslaught of the IS in Iraq has forged an unlikely alignment between Iran and the United States, which have been locked in a cold war for more than three decades.

The fight against the IS has come amid a US diplomatic drive to agree a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, and officials acknowledge the two sides have discussed the war in Iraq on the margins of the nuclear talks.

But the two rivals remain deeply opposed over Syria, with Iran providing crucial military backing for President Bashar al-Assad while Washington has vowed to train a moderate rebel force to eventually confront the Damascus regime.

Analysts and former US officials say neither country appears ready to pursue elaborate cooperation for military operations in Iraq, but there appears to be some level of tactical communication at least to avoid accidents.

As the two governments expand their military activity in Iraq, there is a growing risk of potential crossed signals or conflict as Washington and Tehran remain bitter enemies.
