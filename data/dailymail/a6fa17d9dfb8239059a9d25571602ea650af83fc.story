A couple are offering a £1,000 'reward' to anyone who helps them to sell their 116-year-old converted chapel through social media.

Eden and Lizzi Sutcliffe, who have lived in the property at Corris, near Machynlleth, mid Wales, for more than seven years, became frustrated when they received only one viewing after placing the £199,000 property in the hands of an estate agent last September.

So the pair decided to try a new sales tactic, turning to Facebook and Twitter and offering a £1,000 incentive to any user who puts them in direct touch with whoever eventually buys the house.

The item has been on Facebook three days but has already attracted considerable interest.

Sales: After only getting one initial views for the property, Eden and Lizzi Sutcliffe turned to social media tro try and sell the chapel at Corris, near Machynlleth, mid Wales. Built in 1898, this former Baptist Chapel came into private ownership in the 70s and now consists of a very large living area with multi-fuel stove and mezzanine,
a comfortable bedroom, bathroom and kitchen

Interior: The inside of the house still has a number of features in tact from when it was a functioning chapel. The couple have lived in the property for more than seven years

Privacy: The bedroom is built on a platform which stands higher than the rest of the house. Mrs Sutcliffe said: 'We are also prepared to pay £500 to someone who passes the information to a second person'

Living room: The item has been on Facebook for only three days but has already attracted considerable interest

Raised: The original pulpit area is set up as a seating area which overlooks the rest of the hall. It also acts as a suitable resting place for pets

Doorway: The entrance to the property has a homely door mat in front of it, and leads on to a stain glass window

Open plan: Lizzi and Eden, who make jewellery and drums from recycled materials and also organise non-religious weddings and funeral services

Potential: On the website, the pair has said that Noddfa Chapel has plenty of scope for further development. They say it is great to live in as it is and handily located on the borders of Snowdonia National Park

Terrace: The new owners could relax in the sun on the patio which runs beside the road outside the chapel. The property is surrounded by flowers and colourful plants

Modest bathroom: The couple have used photos which contain all of the items which are still lying around their house

Kitchen: It has fitted wall cupboards and pine shelving, floor cupboard units with fitted worktop and incorporating appliance spaces, ceramic tiles above worktops, windows to both front and side

Spare bedroom: Guests can enjoy a bedroom a nights sleep away from the main hall in a different part of the chapel

Rural: A different view of the chapel shows it is nestled in the Welsh countryside. On the very edge of Snowdonia National Park with views of Cadair Idris

Patio: The new owners would be able to enjoy the table and chairs in the garden. The couple have admitted they do not have any future pans despite their plans to move

Garden: There is a stunning view of the surrounding woodland from the rear of the house
