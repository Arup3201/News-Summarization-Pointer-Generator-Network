By day, 27-year-old Waseem Akram sells mobile phone accessories from an alleyway shop in an old neighbourhood in Pakistan.

But by night, he stands before a mirror, shaving off his beard and picking through mascara and rouge to become Rani, a female wedding party dancer.

'Life is so hard, one job is not enough to help me and my family,' Akram says, the bachelor's voice taking on Rani's higher register. 

'Being a dancer at weddings, parties and private events helps me to earn much more money than working in a shop.'

Across conservative Pakistan, where extremists launch near-daily attacks and many follow a strict interpretation of their Muslim faith, male cross-dressers face a challenge balancing their two identities.

Male and female roles are clearly defined in Pakistan and transgender people often face harassment and abuse.

Some have left their villages for the anonymity of a big city, fearing the reactions of their families while still concealing their identity from neighbours and co-workers. 

One role where they are tolerated is as dancers at weddings and other celebrations at which men and women are strictly segregated. 

In between the dancing and showers of rupee notes, they must fend off groping hands from drunken guests.

Under threat: Bakhtawar Ijaz, 43, puts on a bra while preparing  to go out. Across conservative Pakistan, where Islamic extremists launch near-daily attacks and many follow a strict interpretation of their Muslim faith, male cross-dressers like Ijaz face a severe challenge of balancing two identities

Dancer Bakhtawar Ijaz applies makeup at home in Rawalpindi as he prepares to go out. He says: 'I am a very shy man. Eyes always follow me when I walk out of the apartment that I share with a few friends who are dancers like me. Being with them is like being with a family. When I am surrounded by them, I feel safe'

They can also be seen begging for money in the streets, wearing female dress and makeup. 

Many earn money by blessing newborn babies, which reflects a widespread belief in Pakistan and other South Asian nations that God answers the prayers of someone born underprivileged.

A 2011 Supreme Court ruling allowed transgender people to get national identity cards recognising them as neither male nor female and allowing them to vote. 

Transgendered politicians have also run for office.

In Punjabi, they're known as 'hijra.' Estimates suggest thousands of 'hijra' live among Pakistan's 180 million people.

For Akram though, being Rani means simply cross-dressing.

'I am not transgendered. I am a man who simply enjoys dancing and need money to have a better life and being a woman is the way,' he told the Associated Press in Rawalpindi, just outside of Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. 

Others proudly identify as transgendered, though they can feel people's stares.

'I am a very shy man. Eyes always follow me when I walk out of the apartment that I share with a few friends who share the same job like mine (as) dancers,' says Bakhtawar Ijaz, 43, preparing to meet clients to design women's clothes. 

'Being with them is like being with a family. When I am surrounded by them, I feel safe, respected and empowered.'

Amjad Mahmoud, a 44-year-old tailor, proudly identifies himself as transgendered. 

'The only thing that I can't do as a woman is conceive babies,' he says.
