Osborne: The Government is looking at options to ease child benefit cuts

George Osborne signalled  yesterday that he will try to ease the burden of child benefit cuts on middle-income families.

Families earning between £40,000 and £80,000 are expected to receive some financial relief to ease the pain of plans to strip the benefit from those with one parent paying the 40p rate of income tax.

The Chancellor said the Government would announce details of how the child benefit policy would work in the next few months – after coming under public pressure from David Cameron to act.

The Mail understands that one option being looked at is to raise the threshold at which child benefit would be removed from £42,375 to £50,000.

Under official calculations, that would reduce the number of families hit from 1.2 million to under a million.

Other plans being looked at would see the benefit gradually cut for those higher on the income scale or phased out over time.

It could also be taken away from second and third children.

Mr Osborne insisted he would press ahead with the policy, due to come into force in April 2013.

‘We are very clear that it is fair that those who are better off in our society make a contribution to the saving of money we need to make to pay down the debts so we will be removing child benefit from higher rate taxpayers,’ said the Chancellor.

Should middle-income families keep child benefit?

‘We haven’t set out how we are going to implement that and we are going to do that in the next few months.

‘But the principle that it is not fair to ask someone who is earning say £20,000 or £25,000 to pay for someone who is on £80,000 or £100,000 to get child benefit is one that I think is very important.’

Mr Osborne was forced to make a public statement after the Prime Minister voiced concerns about fairness on Thursday.

Simply
raising the threshold to £50,000 or £80,000 would not end the ‘cliff 
edge’ loss of benefits when one partner becomes a higher rate taxpayer. 
The Prime Minister has called for changes that would alter ‘the 
steepness of the curve’.

Mr Cameron received vocal support 
yesterday from Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who stated explicitly that
the Government is rethinking the issue. ‘We are looking at ways to make
it fairer,’ he said.

Child benefit is usually claimed by mothers and polls show the coalition's plans have not played well with women voters

Downing Street wants to see changes because child benefit is usually claimed by mothers and polls show the plans have not played well with women voters.

Treasury sources sought to downplay widespread speculation in Westminster that Mr Osborne would use March’s Budget statement to announce a change of heart.

One official said there is ‘every chance’ details may be delayed until later in the year because the Chancellor wants to focus the Budget on measures to kickstart the economy.

But a senior Government source said: ‘We are going to do it, but it’s not yet clear how. It’s very difficult but we want to get it done.’

Tory MPs welcomed the apparent change of heart. Pauline Latham said: ‘It did seem unfair for those people who have only one earner in a higher tax bracket losing the child benefit.’

But Labour accused the Government of presiding over a ‘total shambles’.

Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said: ‘We have repeatedly warned that the Government’s current plans to cut child benefit are unfair and highly bureaucratic.’
