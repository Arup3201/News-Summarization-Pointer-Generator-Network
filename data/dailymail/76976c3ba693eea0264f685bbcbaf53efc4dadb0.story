Connor Tremble, 17, was allegedly murdered by jealous love rival Will Blencowe

A jilted young man stabbed his 17-year-old love rival to death hours after warning him to 'run' if they ever met, a jury heard.

Connor Tremble, aged 17 years, suffered multiple stab wounds at his flat and died in hospital 40 hours later.

Will Blencowe, aged 21 years, went to his 'love rival’s' flat the night before Valentine’s Day and attacked him after finding out the teenager was seeing his ex-girlfriend Aimee Harrison.

With the help of two close friends, Bradley Jones and Grant Clemens, Blencowe then fled more than 50 miles away, the court was told.

However, police tracked him down and arrested him on Valentine’s Day, while Connor was still fighting for his life.

Told he was being arrested for attempted murder, Blencowe 'giggled'.

At the opening day of the trial at Oxford Crown Court, prosecutor Richard Barton told the jury: 'This case concerns how a troubled young man had wholly unwarranted feelings of jealousy and resentment towards his former girlfriend’s new partner and those feelings led him, after some planning on his part, to track down and stab to death that young man, the person who he perceived to be his love rival.

'Immediately after he fatally wounded that young man he fled the scene in what was a vain attempt to avoid detection.

'He met up with two close friends who, out of some misplaced sense of loyalty, knowingly assisted him in that attempt to avoid detection and avoid facing the consequences of that attack.'

Blencowe had been in a troubled and violent relationship with Miss Harrison for around four years. Mr Barton told the jury of seven women and five men that during that time he had a short temper and was jealous of anyone who showed an interest in her.

He added that Blencowe owned a range of knives, including a machete and a flick knife.

Mr Barton said: 'To her he seemed obsessed with these weapons.'

The couple broke up in September 2013 and Miss Harrison began dating Connor early this year. They tried to keep the relationship quiet but Blencowe found out.

The court heard Blencowe had mental health difficulties and was living at special accommodation in Banbury, Oxfordshire.

The day Connor was stabbed Blencowe had a meeting with a key worker, appearing emotional and telling her he still loved Miss Harrison.

When she tried to cheer him up, he said: 'What’s the point? I’m going to be dead or in jail.'

Later that afternoon Miss Harrison called Blencowe after finding out he had been making threats towards Connor.

She asked him: 'What should I tell Connor if he sees you?'

He responded: 'Just tell him to run.'

At around 5.20pm that day Blencowe got a train from Banbury to Oxford and then a taxi to near Connor’s flat in Fairacres Road.

Mr Barton told that by a 'terrible coincidence' the door to Connor’s flat had been painted that day and had to be left ajar.

Connor
 had returned to the flat at about 6.30pm and was in the living room 
while a friend who was staying with him was in the bedroom.

The friend heard Connor shouting and when he went to see what was happening caught a glimpse of someone fleeing the scene.

He found Connor bleeding profusely on the floor and saying: 'I’m dying.'

Emergency services were called at 6.43pm and Connor was rushed to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery.

He had been stabbed through the lung and had multiple wounds on his back and buttocks, as if he had been on his stomach 'with someone repeatedly stabbing from above', said Mr Barton.

Meanwhile Blencowe returned to his taxi and was driven to Witney, Oxfordshire, taking off a heavy coat and woollen hat on the journey.

Mr Barton said: “Neither that clothing or that weapon have been retrieved.”

Blencowe was then driven by his mother to Kingham, Oxfordshire, where he met up with Jones and they were then both dropped in Chipping Norton.

They then got a taxi to Clemens’ home in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, where the prosecutor said they hatched a plan to get Blencowe away.

Mr Barton said they convinced Bradley and Declan Townsend to drive Blencowe to Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, where he checked into the Croft Guest House.

He moved to another guest house the next day but police tracked him down and arrested him at around 4pm on February 14, when Connor was still alive.

Mr Barton said: 'When they told him it was attempted murder he repeated that. He said "attempted murder?" And he giggled.'

A search of the Croft Guest House found a small amount of blood on a hand towel.

'The blood on that tiny spot has DNA that matches Connor Tremble’s DNA,' said Mr Barton.

'The chances of it not coming from Connor Tremble or somebody related to him is one in a billion.'

The court also heard that Blencowe had threatened and assaulted another man who he found out Miss Harrison was seeing after they broke up.

Blencowe was subsequently charged with murder, which he denies.

Jones, aged 21 years, from Bledington, near Chipping Norton, and 21-year-old Clemens, from Stockwells, Moreton-in-Marsh, both deny perverting the course of justice.

The three-week trial, before Judge Patrick Eccles at Oxford Crown Court, continues.
