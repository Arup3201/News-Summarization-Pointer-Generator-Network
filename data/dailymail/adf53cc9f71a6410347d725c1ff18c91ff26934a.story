The three-year-old girl who made headlines after her grandmother claimed she'd been kicked out of KFC because her disfigured face scared customers, has got a new eye.

Mississippi's Victoria Wilcher was fitted with a prosthetic eye at a Florida hospital on Friday, three months after being mauled by her grandfather's dog.

The toddler will need at least 200 surgeries to repair her damaged face.

'Just being a part of this, this family all I can say is very loving and makes you feel very good,' said Kellum, a retired nurse who chaperoned Victoria and her mother to Naples, told NBC2.

Victoria gained national attention last month when her grandmother, Kelly Mullins, said they were forced to leave KFC because the girl’s scarred face was 'disrupting our customers'.

Although two different investigations disproved the claims, the fast food chain offered to donate $30,000 to the Wilcher family.

Despite sticking to their story, the Wilchers asked KFC to give the money to the foundation of plastic surgeon, Dr Frank Stile - one of two doctors who agreed to work on Victoria’s facial injuries for free.

This week, Victoria traveled to Florida with her 23-year-old mother Tina to meet with prosthetic surgeon Dr Raymond Peters. He performed the surgery for free on Friday.

'It's the first step on a long journey,' the specialist told NBC2. 'If it helps them, it's a gratification you just can't get everyday.'

Heartbreaking: Victoria Wilcher, three, nearly died after being mauled and disfigured in a dog attack in April

Las Vegas plastic surgeon Dr Stile will help rebuild Victoria's right lower eyelid, reduce her scars and try to restore feeling in part of her face. Dr Peters had reached out to him for help.

'We're kind of working against the clock in terms of trying to have a lot of this done before she's school-aged,'  he told NBC2.

More than $100,000 donated via GoFundMe.com and will also go towards Victoria’s medical care.

‘The 
family is committed to having the money put in a discretionary trust 
account for Victoria with a third-party, non-family member designated as
 the trustee,’ Kellum told The Clarion-Ledger.

‘They want to make sure every cent goes toward Victoria getting better.’

Sticking to her story: Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins (left) continues to stand by her 
story, despite an independent inquiry finding no evidence to back up her
 claims

No
 shows: After reviewing surveillance tape from the KFC 
branch, investigators found that Victoria and her grandmother didn't even visit the 
restaurant the day they said they'd been shunned

Victoria
 had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit bull dogs
 ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of
 the home before jumping on her.

They
 dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they continued
 to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his girlfriend,
 Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage.

Apology: The family shared the alleged story on Victoria's Facebook page and KFC was quick to apologize

The dogs then attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs were killed.

Victoria
 was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and 
bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, a broken nose, lost her 
right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face.

Mullins
 and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their 
eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal Control officers.

They have been charged with child endangerment and the case is expected to go before a grand jury in September.

Victoria
 was in the hospital for a month after the attack and upon her return 
home, she continued with physical therapy and wore a feeding tube.
