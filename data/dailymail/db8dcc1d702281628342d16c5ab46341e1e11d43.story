Canadian researchers have found that sounds cause players to overestimate the number of times they win while playing on slot machines. A modern slot machine has an average of 400 sound effects

Winning sounds on slot machines make gambling more exciting, a study has claimed.

Canadian researchers have found that sounds also cause players to overestimate the number of times they win while playing on slot machines.

The study, from the University of Waterloo, observed that sound has always been an integral part of the slot machine playing experience.

Since the early 1900s, players have been rewarded with a ringing bell every time they have a winning combination, but today's slot machines have an average of 400 sound effects.

Modern machines allow players to wager on multiple lines but when they spin and lose, the machine goes quiet.

When they spin and win more than their wager, they hear a celebratory song, according to the study published in Springer's Journal of Gambling Studies.

Interestingly, when a gambler spins and wins back less than their wager, they still hear the celebratory songs despite the fact that overall they lost money on these spins.

Researcher Mike Dixon and his colleagues set out to find if these celebratory sounds could hide the fact that players were losing money.

They measured 96 gamblers' physiological responses to various slot machine game outcomes – wins, losses and losses disguised as wins – with and without sound during play.

One of the responses during play was sweaty palms, which increases skin conductance, which is a measure of arousal.

The gamblers played two sessions on a slot machine simulator.

In one session, both wins and losses disguised as wins were accompanied by rolling sounds and celebratory winning jingles, as well as visual feedback, much like in a typical casino.

In a second session, the sounds were turned off and players only received visual feedback.

Researchers measured 96 gamblers' physiological responses to various slot machine game outcomes - wins, losses and losses disguised as wins - with and without sound during play. Sound influenced the overall levels of arousal of players. More players got sweatier palms in the session with sound than in the session without sound

The researchers measured the participants' skin conductance and heart rate responses to the various outcomes.

At the end of play, the gamblers were asked which session they preferred and why. They also estimated how many spins they had won back more than they wagered.

Sound influenced the overall levels of arousal of players.

Skin conductance responses were significantly greater in the session with sound than in the session without sound.

Players also rated the noisy session as more arousing than the quiet session.

The study found that the majority of players preferred the playing session where wins were accompanied by sounds.

This suggests that not only do sounds make playing more exciting, players enjoy this extra level of excitement.

Mr Dixon also found that sounds also contributed to players overestimating their number of wins.

Gamblers studied rated the noisy session as more arousing than the quiet session. Just under a quarter of the players overestimated their wins when sounds were played, compared with 15 per cent when they were rewarded with visual feedback only

While this overestimation occurred both in the quiet and noisy sessions, it was significantly higher in the session with sound.

Just under a quarter of the gamblers overestimated their wins when sounds were played, compared with 15 per cent when they were rewarded with visual feedback only.

The researchers believe that sounds may form an integral part of 'the disguise' in losses disguised as wins, causing players to think that they have won more often during a playtime session than they actually have.

Mr Dixon said: 'Although sounds may have contributed to players' enjoyment of the game, sound may also lead to an overestimation of winning.

'Both of these effects may contribute to gambling problems, such as misbeliefs about the true chances of winning, and persistence that some players experience when playing slot machines.'
