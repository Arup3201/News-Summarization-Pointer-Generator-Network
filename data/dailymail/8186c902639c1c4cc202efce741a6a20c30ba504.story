Serie A club Parma have been deducted four points for breaching financial regulations.

The sanction adds to the three they were penalised earlier in the season, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) said on Thursday.

Parma's players celebrate beating Juventus at the weekend but the club are rooted to the bottom of Serie A

The decision means that Parma, who despite being last in Serie A beat leaders Juventus 1-0 on Saturday, have been left with 12 points from 30 games. 

The club were declared bankrupt last month and have not paid their players all season.
