Every year, on the night of 30 November, I perform my special Christmas countdown ritual.

First I go up to the loft to collect a blue cardboard storage container. Next I place the large, shallow box on my bed and carefully lift the lid, tantalised by the memory of the treasures within.

Not, as you might think, the decorations for the tree or the lights to festoon the doorways of my house. No, nestled inside, lovingly wrapped in tissue paper, are my collection of Christmas jumpers.

'Far from stressing me out, Christmas 
puts me in a jolly mood of hopeful expectation throughout December'

For a full month from 1st December until the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve I become the woman that style forgot, never missing an opportunity to sashay forth in a jazzy jumper, festooned with Christmas cheer.

Long before Colin Firth wore his embarrassing Christmas reindeer jumper in the film Bridget Jones's Diary, and aeons before jumper fiend Sarah Lund had started parading her vaguely Christmassy, Faroese star sweater in The Killing (available from Gudrun and Gudrun online, 100% organic wool, E280, if you're interested in dressing up as a detective yourself when the Cluedo comes out on Boxing Day), I was making my annual pilgrimage to Oxford Street in search of a Christmas sweater.

'What I've noticed is that my Christmas 
jumpers put everyone else in a good mood as well'

And this year looks to be a vintage year for the jazzy jumper - they've made it back into fashion in a big way. Now even upmarket online retailer net-a-porter has sanctioned the Christmas sweater with a range of exclusive jumpers designed by the likes of Stella McCartney, Moschino and hot new design duo Meadham Kirchoff whose contribution, featuring metallic-embroidered Christmas tree decorations, costs £945.

Meanwhile, the Christmas Jumper Company, launched three years ago by Manchester-based couple Erica and Dave Ratcliffe, after amateur musician Dave failed to find the suitably 'daft' Christmas jumpers he and his band-mates wanted to wear for a Christmas gig, is riding the crest of a Yuletide woollies wave after featuring in a Sony ad and on the X Factor.

At a somewhat more affordable £40, and available for men and women, they can barely keep up with the demand, especially for their shiny-nosed Rudolf model.

Only last week I was tempted by a Markus Lupfer number, featuring a rosy-cheeked Santa, not quite a snip at £225. But what I eventually opted for was a more reasonably prices black Top Shop knitted number, £50, featuring the cutest robin in a woolly hat with a ruby glass bobble and sporting a red breast shot through with lurex thread.

Then, while scanning the rails at River Island, I spotted a sweater that managed to feature snowmen, snowflakes, pudding and Christmas trees all at once, and what looked like some tiger stripes added in for good measure.

'Christmas jumpers put everyone in a good mood'

A miracle of excess, and only £35. So I 
bought that, too, on the basis that that just as there is no such thing 
as a turkey with too many trimmings, the same applies to dressing to 
spread tidings of comfort and joy.

I can't help myself. All year long I am a paradigm of pared-down style. My clothes are classic, tasteful - and probably a trifle dull. But come Christmas I become as ho-ho-ho as Santa and as tinselly as the Christmas tree.

Far from stressing me out, Christmas puts me in a jolly mood of hopeful expectation throughout December, and I dress to match my mood, regardless of the sniggers I engender.

For me a cosy Christmas jumper or sparkly top or something unsuitably sequinned, which looks more barmaid than elegant lady of a certain age, represents the fantasy Christmas I long for.

On the one hand yule logs and real fires burning in the hearth, real candles on real trees, the scent of cinnamon and mulled wine; on the other, glamorous parties, champagne and all-night dancing.

The reality may be cooking 24/7, grumpy relatives, uncooperative kids and a desultory dance around someone's kitchen table on New Year's Eve, but for the weeks leading up to Christmas I am more relaxed – and hopeful - than at any other time of year.

What I've noticed is that my Christmas jumpers put everyone else in a good mood as well. Complete strangers come up to me in cafes to remark on my jumper and we invariably end up getting to know one another.

At the British Library, where I go to study, there is a permanent hush – but everyone looks up from their books and smiles as I pass.

And now silly Christmas sweaters have been co-opted for a good cause with a host of celebrities joining in the fun.

Myleene Klass, Lauren Laverne, Jon Snow and Alison Steadman are just some of names who have been posing in Christmas woollies, in aid of Save The Children, which has designated Friday 14th December as Christmas Jumper Day, inviting the nation to pull on a kitsch festive jumper and donate £1 to the charity.

Well I'll be wearing mine anyway. Will you?
