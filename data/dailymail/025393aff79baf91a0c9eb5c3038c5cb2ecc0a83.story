A Scottish castle, said to be haunted by the ghost of a murdered cardinal, is now on the market - for a cool £1.65million.

The stunning Ethie Castle, near Arbroath, Angus, was once home to Cardinal David Beaton.

Beaton had a reputation for savage persecution of Protestants in the 16th Century and got his comeuppance when he was killed by Protestant nobles, who hung his body out of a window.

Ethie Castle, in Scotland, is said to be haunted by the ghost of murdered Cardinal David Beaton

According to legend, the ghost of the cardinal can still be heard at night as he parades around Ethie, hindered by his gouty leg, which makes a thumping sound as he drags it behind him.

There are other spooky elements to the majestic castle, including a secret staircase to the chapel, ornate public rooms, and a walled garden.

Other amenities include tennis courts and an outdoor swimming pool. 

The expansive property, near Arbroath, Angus, is now on the market for a cool £1.65 million

Beaton, who had a reputation for poor treatment of Protestants, was brutally murdered in 1546

Ethie was built in the 14th Century by the Abbot and monks of Arbroath Abbey.

The small chapel, as well as the Cardinal's Sitting Room, complete with a secret staircase to the Great Hall above, still remains.

Beaton, who became the cardinal and Chancellor of Scotland, was a powerful figure in the Catholic Church.

In 1545, he arranged for the arrest, trial and execution by burning of Protestant preacher George Wishart.

This cruel act ultimately was what lead to Beaton's demise, and just one year later Protestant nobles sought revenge.

According to legend, the ghost of the cardinal can still be heard at night as he walks around Ethie

Due to a gouty leg, the cardinal used to make a great deal of noise while walking, which guests claim to hear

Sightings of the cardinal have primary occurred on the narrow staircase near his old bedroom

In 1546, a group, which included Fife laird John Leslie of Parkhill, managed to get to Beaton after killing his porter.

The cardinal was murdered by the angry men and his corpse mutilated and hung out of a window for all to see.

Shortly thereafter, Beaton's ghost was rumoured to be seen wandering around Ethie, complete with the dragging noise.

Sightings have primarily occurred on the narrow staircase that leads to a secret doorway in his old bedroom.

But the cardinal is not the only ghost believed to haunt the castle. Guests at Ethie have also reported hearing cries of a child at night, followed by the sound of a wheeled toy being pulled across the floor.

Following his death, the cardinal's mutilated corpse was said to be hung out of a window for all to see

Guests at Ethie also report hearing the cries of another ghost - a small child - and the sound of a wheeled toy

Legend has it that a secret room was discovered by a new governess of the castle after being kept awake by the sounds of a boy crying. 

After breaking into the walled room, the governess discovered a skeleton of a child lying on the floor next to the remains of a wooden cart.

Though known primarily for its supernatural activity, Ethie has also played host to many notable people over the years.

In 1665, it was bought by the Earls of Northesk and is said to be the inspiration behind the fictional Castle of Knockwhinnock in Sir Walter Scott's novel, The Antiquary. 

It was later restored by Alistair Forsyth.

Currently, the property is being advertised for purchase with no mention of its ghostly happenings

The house is described as a 'residence of great character' complete with 'many fine features'

Currently, Ethie Castle is being advertised by a Savills estate agent, who describes it as a 'most imposing and historic castle,' though makes no mention of the ghostly goings on.

As the brochure outlines: 'In recent years, the castle has been carefully restored. It has evolved over the centuries from its ancient beginnings and, with its wings and towers, forms a magnificent residence of great character.

'Architecturally, the castle contains many fine features including four turnpike staircases, a balustraded tower, turrets and crow stepped gables.

'The barrel vaulted rooms, together with panelled rooms, decorative plaster work, fireplaces and window shutters all provide an insight into the history associated with the castle.'
