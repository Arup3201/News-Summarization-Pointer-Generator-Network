Former Crystal Palace and Norwich forward Leon McKenzie has exclusively spoken to Sportsmail ahead of his super-middleweight bout with Croatian Ivan Stupalo for the International Masters title.

Undefeated McKenzie has been training at the East Dulwich gym owned by his father - the former British and European light-welterweight champion Clinton - for the biggest fight of his life so far, and the 36-year-old wants to win on March 14 for his dad.

The man nicknamed Big McK discusses juggling work as a deliveryman, looking after five children and training every day as the former Barclays Premier League player likens himself to Rocky Balboa.

'I've got five beautiful children to try and support the best I can. Working and fighting I'm no better than no other man that's doing the same as me,' McKenzie tells Sportsmail. 

'Just because I've played Premier League football it does not mean that I'm too good to work.

'I work for DPD. I'm delivering parcels. It's challenging. I'm delivering 60-odd, 70 parcels a day. You're lifting boxes, you're in and out of the van. That's probably a little bit of training in itself. 

'I sometimes jog in between because we're on a timer. It's kind of like a Rocky thing going on.'

The best moment of McKenzie's football career came  in April 2005, scoring in a 2-0 win against a Manchester United team boasting Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. 

Almost 10 years on he is looking for a new accomplishment, and beating Stupalo in the 10-round fight would make him the mandatory for the Southern Area title.

That is the main objective on Saturday, and delivering parcels does not compare to how his father has been working him in the gym.

'In training dad pushes me to my max,' McKenzie continues. 'I'm used to dying in training and coming back. It will be the same principle in fights. When it gets hard I have to grit my teeth. 

'I know where I've been before so it will be the same principle. I can die and I come back, I can die and I come back. We're going to win the fight, and I want to win it for my dad as well. 

'After training I'll just have a little time by myself. Dad says that's normal when you just go within yourself, and have little flashbacks of life and everything else. 

'Anything can happen. One punch changes everything.'

'This means everything to me because since a child I always knew I was going to be something. Obviously football took off and we always had another little dream in the background. I always used to love watching dad fight. 

'I've started very carefully. For this to be happening, I'm 37 this year, it is a really big deal. All the years that we've been training, day in, day out. I've always been an athlete so this to me is massive. It opens up a lot of doors as well, boxing wise, to go on to bigger and better things, which is another thing. 

'Winning this puts me in mandatory position for a Southern Area shot at some point, which is another big deal. 

'I have to work. I've got five beautiful children to try and support the best I can. Working and fighting I'm no better than no other man that's doing the same as me. 

'Just because I've played Premier League football it does not mean that I'm too good enough to work. 

'I work for DPD, I'm delivering parcels. It's challenging. I'm delivering 60-odd, 70 parcels a day. You're lifting boxes, you're in and out of the van, that's probably a little bit of training in itself. 

'I sometimes jog in between because we're on a timer. You're having to jog in between and you might run behind, but I just look at that as part of the training. It's kind of like a Rocky thing going on. 

'In training dad pushes me to my max. I'm used to dying in training and coming back. It will be the same principle in fights. When it gets hard I have to grit my teeth. I know where I've been before so it will be the same principle. I can die and I come back, I can die and I come back.
