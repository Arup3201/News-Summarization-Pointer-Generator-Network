Who should be England's next captain?

Zinedine Zidane believes Steven Gerrard's retirement from international football will benefit Liverpool just like it did for Manchester United when Paul Scholes quit England.

Gerrard announced his decision to retire from Three Lions duty on Monday after winning 114 caps for his country during a 14-year spell.

The 34-year-old cited focusing on his club career with Liverpool as one of his main reasons, a decision Zidane says that will benefit him and the club greatly.

Captain fantastic: Zinedine Zidane believes Gerrard's decision will benefit his club career at Liverpool greatly

The former Real Madrid galatico, used Manchester United legend Paul Scholes as an example after he quit the international scene.

Scholes retired from England duty after being knocked out of the Euro 2004 quarter-finals to Portugal and won a further 11 trophies at Old Trafford before hanging up his football boots for good at the end of the 2012/13 campaign.

The 39-year-old maestro's honours in that spell included a further five Premier League titles as well as another Champions League crown and Zidane believes Gerrard could replicate similar success devoting all his energy to Anfield.

'It is a big decision - but I can understand it and I think it will be good for Liverpool,' he said.

'Liverpool showed last season that they are close to achieving something special - and it is so important they have their captain available.

'They are back in the Champions League this season - and as you get older you have to accept you can't play every game for club and country.

'I am sure it was not an easy decision for Steven - but I think it is the right one for himself and Liverpool.

'I remember how surprised people were when Paul Scholes retired from playing for England - but Manchester United saw the benefit of that.

'He was winning Premier League titles until his late 30s - and now Steven doesn't have the responsibility of playing for England - you feel he can replicate that with Liverpool.'

Zidane, who won 108 caps with France, added that although Gerrard will miss playing for his country - he will enjoy being able to spend more time with his family.

'Playing for your country is the biggest honour in the game and nobody will ever complain about it - but it does take you away from your family,' the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 winner expressed.

'In a year when there is an international tournament you don't get to spend as much time with them as you like - and then there is the qualifiers taking you all over Europe as well. I am sure that his family played a part in his decision as well.'
