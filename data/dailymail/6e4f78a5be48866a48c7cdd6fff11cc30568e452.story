Real Sociedad want Arsenal to sell their £3.5million buy-back option on striker Carlos Vela.

The club president Jokin Aperribay and vice president Angel Oyarzun flew to London at the weekend to secure the 50 per cent rights retained by Arsenal following Vela's sale last summer.

Aperribay only has until July 1 to acquire the rights and Arsenal are looking for £6.5m plus bonuses, which could reach £8m for the 25-year-old.
