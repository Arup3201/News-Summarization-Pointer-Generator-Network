Items which belonged to musician Louis Armstrong have been unveiled including a mold of his face revealing the jazz trumpeter's creases on his forehead, bags under his eyes and scars on his lips from a life-time of horn-playing.

The mold, which has a bronze painted finish, was made in the 1950s.

The artefacts have gone on display at 
the Louis Armstrong House Museum, in Queens, New York, which is 
celebrating its 10th anniversary.

His two-story home in the Corona section of Queens, which has been turned into a museum, is remarkably understated for the charismatic performer whose improvisational playing style and raspy singing won him fame as far back as the 1920s.

The house and its furnishings, including a funky, blue wood-lacquered kitchen, are virtually unchanged from when Armstrong lived there with his wife, Lucille, from 1943 to 1971, when he died from a heart attack in his bedroom at age 69.

Armstrong could have lived in a house with 'a pool in the shape of a trumpet' but chose to stay in the working-class neighborhood, said Michael Cogswell, director of the national and city landmark.

'Louis wasn't treated as a celebrity here,' Cogswell said. He could go to the corner barbershop and 'wait his turn in line with the other men from the community.'

When Armstrong's bus would return from a tour, children from the block would help carry his trumpet and suitcases inside the house. 

'Then Lucille would fix up bowls of ice cream for everybody, and they would watch Westerns together on TV,' Cogswell said.

Unique style: The home has become a mini-Mecca for jazz lovers around the world and offers a fascinating insight into how the musician lived

After Lucille died in 1983, Armstrong's collection of home-recorded tapes, photographs, scrapbooks and other material was donated to Queens College by the Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation. 

It is the largest publicly held archival collection devoted to a jazz musician in the world.

'The house was frozen in time. It was stuffed,' Cogswell said. 'Louis was a packrat.'

Attraction: More than 100,000 people have visited the museum since its opening

Queens Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras said the museum has a long-standing history 'as being a mini-mecca for jazz lovers' and that Armstrong's 'spirit and love of music is still very much a part of the community.'

Along with the life mask, a 10th anniversary exhibition focuses on Armstrong's six-week tour of South America in 1957. 

Armstrong was still reeling over the 
'Little Rock Nine' school integration crisis in Arkansas weeks earlier, 
and a photograph shows him in his Buenos Aires hotel room defiantly 
hanging up on the U.S. ambassador who had asked him to sing 'The 
Star-Spangled Banner' at that evening's concert.

More than 100,000 people have visited the museum since its opening.

A new visitor and exhibition centre with a 72-seat jazz club across the street is scheduled to open in 2016. 

The massive archive will be moved there, allowing its current exhibition space - the Armstrongs' basement recreation room - to return to the way it looked originally.

'We want to be in our own way the Graceland of New York City,' Cogswell said.
