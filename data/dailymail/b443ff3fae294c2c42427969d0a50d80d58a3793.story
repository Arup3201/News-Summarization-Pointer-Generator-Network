A correspondent for CNN was detained by Turkish police while he reported on tensions during demonstrations marking the first anniversary of mass protests in Istanbul live on air.

Ivan Watson was explaining that police had closed off the center of the city to prevent demonstrators laying flowers at the site of last year's protests when he was accosted by plain-clothes police officers.

Audiences watching CNN International on Saturday morning saw Turkish law enforcement demand to see Watson's papers, and those of his crew.

Live on air: Riot police detain Ivan Watson, CNN Turkey correspondent, in Taksim Square during his live reporting in Istanbul, Turkey, Saturday, May 31, 2014

Brutality: Watson was kneed in the back by an officer and detained for half an hour until his passport was produced

'Are you a journalist?' they demand.

As the men pull at Watson's sleeves and surround him, he says, 'I think... I think I'm getting arrested.'

The veteran reporter told anchor Errol Barnett, 'Errol, we're being detained right now.'

Watson shows the police his press card that gives him permission to work in Turkey, but they are not satisfied.

'Which channel? Where is your passport?' they say.

The footage ends there, but according to CNN, Watson was grabbed and kneed in the back by an officer, while another broke the microphone off the CNN camera while trying to take it from the cameraman.

Watson and his team were escorted away by police and detained until Watson's passport was retrieved from the CNN bureau nearby.

Correspondent: Watson has reported from Turkey for 12 years and never had any problems with his press card, he says

He was eventually released after about half an hour.

Watson told CNN that in his 12 years reporting from the country he's never had a problem with his press card, and that the demand to see his passport was unusual.

In late May and June last year, hundreds of thousands of Turks took to the streets denouncing Erdogan's increasingly autocratic leadership and demanding more democratic freedoms. The protests were sparked by opposition to government plans to uproot trees at Taksim Square's Gezi Park and build a shopping center.

Fanned by outrage over the often brutal reaction by police, the demonstrations soon spread to other cities and developed into Turkey's biggest protests in decades. Thousands were wounded and at least 12 people have died in anti-government protests in the past year.

On Saturday, Gezi park was closed off and riot police and plainclothes police were deployed in huge numbers.

Police used tear gas and water cannon on Saturday to push back crowds of protesters who defied a warning by Turkey's prime minister and gathered in Istanbul and Ankara on the anniversary of last year's nationwide anti-government demonstrations.

Riot police fired tear gas on hundreds of protesters on a main pedestrian street leading to Istanbul's main square, Taksim, following a stand-off with police. Clashes also erupted in the capital Ankara, where police used water cannons against a group of stone-throwing protesters.

Dogan new agency video footage showed police, some in plain clothes, detaining several people in the two cities. Abdulbaki Boga, of the Human Rights Association, told The Associated Press at least 83 people were detained and 14 people were injured in Istanbul alone.

Large numbers of police blocked access to Taksim, and news reports earlier said authorities planned to deploy some 25,000 police officers and up to 50 anti-riot water cannon vehicles around the city to thwart the demonstrations. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned activists to keep away from the square, saying authorities were under strict orders to prevent protests.

'I am calling on my people: don't fall for this trap. This is not an innocent environmental action,' Erdogan said.

Despite the ban, hundreds of people tried to reach Taksim.

In a speech in Istanbul earlier, Erdogan said: 'If you go there, our security forces are under strict orders, they will do whatever is necessary from A to Z. You won't be able to go to Gezi like the last time. You have to obey the laws. If you don't, the state will do whatever is necessary.'

Turkey's association of journalists condemned Watson's detention and called the police action 'shameful.'

He told CNN that officers later apologized for the officer who had kneed him in the back.

A report this week by the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights said that more than 5,600 demonstrators were being prosecuted for involvement in the protests while no one responsible for the violence against protesters had been sentenced.

The Turkish authorities 'are actively engaging in a witch hunt against those who participated in the protests or spoke out,' said the federation's president, Karim Lahidji.
