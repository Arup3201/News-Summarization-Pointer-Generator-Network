A senior Scientologist has condemned the controversial religion's leader for turning the organisation into an autocratic, heavy-handed fundraising machine.

Debbie Cook, one of the most respected members within the Church, sent a shock email denouncing chairman David Miscavige to 12,000 Scientologists just minutes after midnight on New Year's Day.

She accuses him of turning the Church, which numbers celebrity followers including Tom Cruise and John Travolta, into a tyrannical regime in direct conflict with the doctrine laid down by founder L Ron Hubbard in the 1950s.

Writing under a banner of 'Keep 
Scientology Working', Mrs Cook called out Mr Miscavige for 'hoarding' 
more than $1billion acquired through fundraising and then spending 
millions on building unnecessary, lavish facilities that lie empty.

The
 50-year-old wrote: 'Only a tiny fraction has ever been spent... Only 
the interest earned from the holdings has been used very sparingly to 
fund projects through grants.

She also accuses Mr Miscavige of chipping away at laws designed to prevent the Church being turned into a one-man dictatorship.

Mrs
 Cook confirmed her continued commitment to the Church Of Scientology 
and called on her fellow worshippers to usher in an era of change.

She wrote: 'We are a strong and powerful
 group and we can effect a change. We have weathered many storms. I am 
sorry that I am the one telling you, but a new storm is upon us.'

It is thought that the reason Mrs Cook 
emailed thousands of worshippers was to get around the 'long and harsh' 
disciplinary action endured by those who question Mr Miscavige's 
methods.

She claimed it was her conscience that caused her to speak out.

'I
 dedicated my entire adult life to supporting L Ron Hubbard and the 
application of LRH technology,' she wrote. 'And if I ever had to look 
LRH in the eye I wouldn’t be able to say I did everything I could to 
Keep Scientology Working if I didn’t do something about it now.

'We
 all have a stake in this. It is simply not possible to read the LRH 
references and not see the alterations and violations that are currently
 occurring.'

Mrs Cook 
was once a leading member of Scientology's Sea Organisation before 
becoming a captain at its Flag Service Organization spiritual 
headquarters in Clearwater, Florida. She left that position a few years 
ago but remains a highly-respected member of the Church.

A spokesman for the Church dismissed Mrs Cook's email as reflecting 'a small, ignorant and unenlightened view of the world
today'.

Graeme Wilson said: 'Her opinions are not shared by the thousands of Scientologists who
are overjoyed by our 27 new Churches and what they mean to the communities
they serve.'
