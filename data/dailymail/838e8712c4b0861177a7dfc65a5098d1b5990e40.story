A pensioner blinded in one eye after being struck by a cricket ball has regained his sight almost half a century after he lost it thanks to a routine check-up.

Alan Read from Sowerby, near Thirsk in North Yorkshire, was 36 when he was hit above his left eye with a cricket ball while playing for village team East Burgholt, in Suffolk.

He was told by doctors that the freak accident meant he would never see out of his eye again due to the pressure which had built up behind it.

Alan Read, who has regained the sight in his left eye, 48 years after being struck in the head with the cricket ball 

Mr Read, 84, continued to work and play sport throughout his life while coming to terms with the fact he would never see again out of his left eye.

However decades later when a cataract began to grow on his healthy eye, surgeons assessed the damaged one and realised they could give the pensioner his sight back after 48-years by relieving the pressure.

His sight was restored after a three hour operation after he was sent to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough and operated on by Dr Vaideanie Collins.

Now aged 84, Mr Read said: 'Getting my sight back was incredible.

'After the operation I came round and my sight was fine, and I could see things I couldn't see before.

'I still wake up in the morning and close my right eye to check if I can see out of my left. I feel like I have a new lease of life now and it's marvellous.

The pensioner had an operation to relieve the pressure behind his eye following a routine check up 

'I was the first person she had done the operation on and when I went back to see her she told me she could do it on two or three others.'

Although the father-of-two can now boast of his clear vision for the first time since the accident, he said he had not longed for his sight to come back over the years and had to accept what had happened.

'It was one of those things and I had to cope,' he said. 'I couldn't see very well and I had to adapt to that.

'I had my own cleaning business with ladies working for me, so it didn't affect work.

'I continued to play cricket and was hit on the head a couple of times, but I was never as good as before the accident.' 

I don't even remember this, but someone later told me I was on my knees on the ground and I said 'I am looking for my eye'.

''I had a cut across my left eyebrow and was taken to hospital for an x-ray.

Mr Read was operate on by Dr Vaideanie Collins at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesborough 

The doctors said at the time it was likely my eye would burst because of the pressure behind it.

''All I could see out of it was a grey light, and I had to just lie down and rest for nearly week.

''I was not really shocked when I was told I wouldn't be able to see out of it again. I think I realised that myself and I did get used to it very quickly, because what can you do?

''There are people worse off than me so I didn't get sad or upset. I just' thought 'well that's it', there's nothing you can do about it.' 

Mr Read's wife, Jo, 85, said that because of his age she feared he might die during the operation, but was relieved when her husband came round.

She said: 'I was thrilled with the result and couldn't believe it.

'It's marvellous he's got his sight back and he can now stand at the window and look at the hills to pick out things he has never seen before.'
