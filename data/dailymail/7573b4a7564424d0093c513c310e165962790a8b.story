Teenagers are tired of sharing every detail of their lives online and are taking increasing steps to safeguard their privacy on social media, a report has revealed. 

Young people are un-tagging pictures, writing false posts and even adopting parallel identities in a bid to keep their personal information safe, according to the Market Research Society.

They have even resorted to posting deliberately vague statements on their accounts - known as 'vague-booking' - to prompt real friends to respond privately for further details.

Vague-booking: Young people are deliberately posting vague statements and false information in a bid to keep their personal data private, research has found

The findings contradict Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's claims in 2010 that the age of privacy is over - and no longer a 'social norm'.

The report, by Colin Strong of the MRS Delphi Society, says the rise of apps like Snapchat - which erases pictures after a short amount of time - show teenagers are increasingly concerned about what strangers see.

His report says: 'There is an almost universally held view that teenagers simply don’t care enough about online privacy.'

At face value, this appears to be true, as many young people flood public social media accounts like Twitter and Instagram with endless streams of selfies and personal information.

Mr Strong cites the example of Paris Brown, who was forced to resign from her position as the country's first youth police crime commissioner in 2013 after a series of ill-advised tweets she had posted years before emerged.  

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg claimed people had become more comfortable with sharing private information online

Jane Frost, chief executive of the MRS, told The Sunday Times that she estimates a third of Twitter users have a private account, only shared with close friends, as well as a public persona.

She had many used several fake identities for things like video gaming, while closely guarding accounts made using their real names. 

Ms Frost said the findings will pose problems for businesses, who will not be to take consumers for granted. 

Mr Strong adds that just because young people post things in public forums, it does not mean have no desire for privacy.

'Just because it's in a public space doesn't mean they want publicity,' he said.

His views are in stark contrast to those of Mr Zuckerberg, the chief executive of the world's biggest social network.

Speaking at the Crunchie Awards in 2010, he claimed people had grown more comfortable sharing their private information online.

He said: 'People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people.

'That social norm is just something that has evolved over time.'

He explained the rise of social media reflected the changing attitudes of people.

'When I got started in my dorm room at Harvard, the question a lot of people asked was, 'why would I want to put any information on the internet at all? Why would I want to have a website?'

'Then in the last 5 or 6 years, blogging has taken off in a huge way, and just all these different services that have people sharing all this information.'
