Eric Scheldt had only been a dad for a matter of moments when he discovered his life would be full of fresh challenges, like driving to the hospital with one hand while you cradle your newborn daughter in the other.

Eric had gotten in the car at little after 5 a.m. that Monday morning with wife Aubrianne, desperate to reach Scripps La Jolla Hospital. The first-time mom's water had broken.

As Eric drove passed Del Mar, Aubrianne stopped speaking to him. Then she grabbed for his arm.

Eric and Aubrianne delivered their new baby girl Iona on the side of the road

Their newborn baby girl is a healthy 9 pounds

Then she told him she could see the baby's head.

'I started to hear little chortling 
sounds, just little cries. And I was like, â€˜Oh my God,â€™' Eric told NBC San Diego. 
'Immediately just pulled over, and I guess the baby may have been 
halfway out or three-quarters. I just reached in and gave a little tug, 
and she just came right out.'

The couple took prenatal classes and 
Aubrianne studied hypnobirthing, but Eric's background was in financial 
services and he had no time for special training before this delivery.

Though the couple took some prenatal classes nothing could have prepared them for a roadside birth

At 5:33 a.m. Eric called 911 and highway patrol and firefighters were dispatched to the scene.

The family was able to make it to the hospital on their own though.

The baby's umbilical cord was still attached when they reached the hospital.

Aubrianne told her husband she could see the baby's head as the pair sped to the hospital

A security guard saw them and ran to get help. 

They named the newborn baby girl Iona. She's 9lbs. 2 oz. and 20 inches long, and both she and her mother are very healthy.
