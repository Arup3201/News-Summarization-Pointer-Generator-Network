Sir John Major has been pictured 
shaking hands with former IRA commander Martin McGuinnness at the 
funeral of the late taoiseach Albert Reynolds, architect of the Northern
 Irish peace process.

Hundreds
 of mourners from the world of
 politics, business, horse racing and music gathered at the Church of 
the Sacred Heart, Donnybrook, Dublin to pay their last respects to the 
determined peacemaker - including the former Prime Minister and Sinn 
Fein leader.

Sir John signed the Downing
 Street Declaration with Mr Reynolds in 1993, paving the way for peace
 talks involving the British and Irish governments and Sinn Fein.

At
 the opening of the mass, chief celebrant Father Brian D'Arcy, a friend 
of Mr Reynolds' for 50 years, made special mention about the attendance 
of Sir John, a friend of Mr Reynolds in the years after both left 
office.

Fr D'Arcy said he 
told the former prime minister it was particularly important for the 
family that he could be there to which he replied: 'Where else would I 
be on this day?'

The congregation burst into a round of applause.

Mr Reynolds was remembered as a determined peacemaker who led Ireland with honesty and deep rooted goodness.

Pope
 Francis set the tone for the service with a telegram for the family 
honouring Mr Reynolds' work towards peace and reconciliation in Northern
 Ireland.

'Recalling with 
gratitude the late taoiseach's efforts to promote peace and 
reconciliation in Ireland, His Holiness prays for the eternal repose of 
his soul,' the pontiff said.

81-year-old Mr Reynolds died last Thursday after a long illness

Mr Reynolds was a religious man who prayed up until his death aged 81 last Thursday.

He is survived by his wife Kathleen, two sons, Philip and Abby, and five daughters Emer, Miriam, Leonie, Cathy and Andrea.

They
 confirmed last year that their father had been suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease, which the funeral heard in truth took them from him
 many years before now.

The 
family took centre stage at the state funeral where Taoiseach Enda Kenny
 and President Michael D Higgins joined former taoisigh Liam Cosgrave, 
John Bruton, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen to lead a long line of 
dignitaries paying respects.

In
 a heartfelt eulogy Philip, the elder son who now runs the C&D Foods
 business, described his father as 'an innately good man' who has 
'slipped away to do his next deal'.

He
 touched on suggestions that Mr Reynolds' legacy of helping to create 
lasting peace in Ireland was only celebrated with his death and not 
while he was alive.

'Few of 
us will ever bend the course of history but our collective efforts can 
make this a better place. How successful he was in his life is for 
others to judge. To us it does not matter, he was simply brilliant,' he 
said.

'To know dad was to 
understand him - satisfied with his life's work, because he lived it 
with goodness at its core, a generosity of spirit that people liked and a
 brilliance of mind to bring those two fantastic attributes together to 
make a difference.'

Philip Reynolds said his father was a character of honesty and deep goodness.

Mr
 Reynolds' grandchildren offered gifts symbolising his life including a 
book of cloakroom tickets for his days running dancehalls, a tin of dog 
for his C&D Foods business, a copy of the Longford News, his 
personal copy of the Downing Street Declaration, a race card, a football
 and sliotar used in Gaelic games, a deck of cards, a telephone, a 
family photo from 1980, a replica train carriage and the Freedom of 
Longford award.

A photograph
 of the former taoiseach was on display in the church along with the 
quotation from a sermon by James Freeman Clarke: 'A politician thinks 
about the next election; a statesman thinks of the next generation.'

A
 separate picture of Mr Reynolds with his wife adorned the mass booklet 
with the proud quote: 'Marrying Kathleen was the best decision of my 
life.'

The state funeral 
involved the coffin being draped in the Irish Tricolour and pall bearers
 from the Defence Forces carrying Mr Reynolds' remains from the church 
and again at Shanganagh Cemetery in Shankill, Co Dublin were he was 
buried.

Eighteen outriders formed a cavalry motorcycle Escort of Honour to bring the cortege to the graveyard.

The
 rain soaked cemetery was the scene for final prayers and a volleys of 
shots fired over the burial plot. The Reynolds family also received the 
Irish Tricolour from the coffin.

Prayers
 of the faithful were offered during the mass by Mr Reynolds' children, 
each of which recalled a characteristic of his life, work and 
personality.

Archbishop Diarmuid Martin gave the final blessing at the mass. He said: 'Albert Reynolds was responsive and creative and determined in his desire to move forward in the search for peace and for a more just, secure and prosperous Ireland'

Miriam remembered her father's doggedness and dedicated her message to the marginalised.

'n
 the relentless pursuit of his political objectives dad was frequently 
isolated, shunned and vilified - the Lonesome Boatman,' she said.

'Fortunately for all of us he was blessed with noble qualities which sustained him though those bruising, gruelling years.'

Born
 in November 1932 in Rooskey, Co Roscommon, Mr Reynolds was elected to 
the Irish parliament in 1977 and went on to become taoiseach in February
 1992 in a coalition government.

He
 led two coalitions but turbulent political events at home collapsed 
each partnership and he will go down in history as serving some of the 
shortest times as taoiseach.

A number of nurses who cared for Mr Reynolds in his final years also attended the funeral.

Mr
 Reynolds's remains were brought to the church on Saturday evening after
 lying in state in the Mansion House for several hours that afternoon.

The
 coffin, draped in the Irish Tricolour, was watched over by Garda Donie 
Hanrahan, who served as Mr Reynolds' personal protection officer during 
his time as Taoiseach and for the subsequent 16 years.

Following his death Gda Hanrahan offered to stay with his remains as a final duty.

Tributes
 flooded in from home and abroad in the days since Mr Reynolds' death 
with contemporaries heralding the massive legacy he left after taking 
risks to carve out the Northern Ireland peace process.

The
 esteem he was held in for this work was marked by the political figures
 who attended including Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Mr McGuinness 
and former SDLP leader and Nobel prize winner John Hume.

Archbishop Diarmuid Martin gave the final blessing at the mass.

'In
 his life, in his responsibility for the political and economic destiny 
of those he was called to serve, Albert Reynolds was responsive and 
creative and determined in his desire to move forward in the search for 
peace and for a more just, secure and prosperous Ireland,' he said.

'He
 sought peace with determination. God knows, today we urgently need an 
international community which seeks peace with similar determination at a
 moment in which our world is marked increasingly frightening and 
horrendous violence.'
