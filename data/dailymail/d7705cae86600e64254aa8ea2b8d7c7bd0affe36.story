Four people were killed when a semitrailer slammed into a cow crossing a rural Tennessee highway, before skidding across the median and crashing into two oncoming vehicles.

Police said the driver of the semi was heading eastbound
on the Interstate 40 in Henderson County late on Tuesday night when he hit the cow and
lost control of the vehicle.

The semi swerved into the westbound lanes before plowing into a tractor-trailer and an SUV.
