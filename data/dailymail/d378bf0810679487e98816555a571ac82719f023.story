QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt is keen to return to Italy this month following his loan with AC Milan last season. 

Lazio and Torino have shown an interest in the playmaker, who started against Burnley on Saturday. 

Taarabt said: 'I’ve always said I want a change of scenery, and I repeat that. There’s been contact with some Italian clubs, let’s see.'

Meanwhile, QPR are continuing to show interest in Inter Milan midfielder Yann M'Vila.

Inter want QPR to take over their loan of the player from Rubin Kazan and that means QPR picking up 80 per cent of his wages. 

M'Vila has so far shown little inclination in moving to Loftus Road but has few better offers. 

Taarabt, started against Burnley at the weekend, has only made four appearances for QPR this season
