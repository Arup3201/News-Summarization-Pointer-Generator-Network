Hospitals hired doctors from at least 27 countries last year including Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Qatar and Australia.

Most were used to plug desperate staffing shortages on wards, X-ray units and overstretched A&E departments.

Experts say the health service has no choice as it has failed to train enough of its own doctors to meet the needs of the rising and aging population.

The situation is the same for other front line staff and nearly 6,000 nurses were recruited from overseas last year, many from Spain and Portugal.

The NHS has no choice but to recruit foreign doctors as it has failed to train enough of its own staff to meet the needs of the rising and aging population, experts warned today

And figures uncovered this week show that ambulance services last year hired 180 paramedics, mainly from Australia, and plan to recruit more over the next few months.

Figures obtained by the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act show that 32 out of 160 hospital trusts recruited 321 doctors from abroad last year, from 27 different countries.

The true number is likely to be far higher as many trusts failed to respond.

Separate figures from the General Medical Council show that 2, 957 doctors who trained oversees joined the register last year. But it is not possible to say how many of these subsequently got jobs within he NHS.

Southampton hired the most, at 113, while Northern Lincolnshire and Goole is planning to hire 83 this year.

Dr David Rosser, medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of England’s biggest trusts, said: ‘The NHS doesn’t have the number of doctors it needs.

‘The shortage is real. We aren’t training enough doctors in this country, and so we are dependent on foreign-trained doctors.

‘Doctors in more and more branches of medicine report shortages, especially in specialities such as A&E, where it’s tough work.’

He said it would take at least ten years to train-up enough British doctors. 

GPs take ten years to train while consultants take 13 including, five years at university.

The shortages are particularly severe in A&E and radiology, where doctors analyse X-rays and scans for cancer and other illnesses

The shortages are particularly severe in A&E and radiology, where doctors analyse X-rays and scans for cancer and other illnesses.

Dr Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists said: ‘We are very short of radiologists. 

'The main implications for patient safety are delays in scan interpretation and the risks of people getting the wrong treatment, or no treatment, due to not getting the right tests or expert interpretation.’

Most doctors hired from overseas are hospital specialists but a small proportion are likely to have been GPs, and many surgeries are also very short-staffed.

One of those recently recruited was Dr Rensy Mathew, 39, from Qatar, who plans to stay for four years working in A&E at the University Hospital of North Durham.

He was hired following two recruitment fairs in India and the United Arab Emirates respectively which involved interviews and a role-play exercise.

He said: ‘The biggest difference [from Qatar] I would say I noticed is, things are more streamlined.

‘Everyone follows a system, everything goes in a flowchart way.'

‘People are very eager to know where I have come from and what’s my background, they are very courteous, very welcoming and quite keen to know what I have to say and what advice I have to give’

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘In the last five years we have seen an increase in British staff working in the NHS from 88.9 per cent to 89.1 per cent and crucially we have more clinical staff overall – 9,500 extra doctors and 7,800 extra nurses on our wards.

‘Foreign health workers make a valuable contribution to the NHS, but we have introduced language checks to ensure they can properly communicate with their patients.’
