With their skin stained white by clay and calcite sand, these elephants look like ghosts haunting the sun-drenched savannah.

The unusual-looking animals were photographed by a watering hole in Namibia's Etosha National Park after cooling off from the blazing heat with a mud bath.

Once the moisture dried, a residue of dry white calcite sand and white clay was left covering their leathery skin.

'Ghosts': The elephants are said to look like spectres after covering themselves with the water, which stains them white with a combination of white clay and calcite sand 

Felix Reinders, 30, an industrial engineer from South Africa, captured the famous 'white ghosts' of Etosha National Park in September last year.

'The big Etosha elephant bulls come from all different directions to the Nebrownii waterhole and then will spent the whole afternoon there bathing till late,' he said.

'It is almost like their social appointment meeting at the bar. They stand against each other or spraying each other with water.'

The word Etosha means 'great white place', after the vast expanse of white, salt-laced earth which forms a pan in the centre of the national park.

Elephants gather wherever they can find moisture, wallowing in and splashing themselves with mud and water in an effort to cool off beneath the beating hot sun.

When the mud dries they are left caked in the white earth, earning them their reputation as the 'great white ghosts' of Etosha.

Famous: The 'great white ghosts' of Etosha are well known and a big draw for tourists, like South African industrial engineer Felix Reinders, who took these photographs in September last year

'Some of them will stand and just sleep next to the waterhole,' said Mr Reinders.

'Then there is a local black rhino that also wants a sip of the water but the elephant bulls don't like this visitor to their bar.'
