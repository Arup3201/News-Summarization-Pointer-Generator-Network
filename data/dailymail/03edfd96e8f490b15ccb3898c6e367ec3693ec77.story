A dramatic photograph capturing the moment a baby is born has been reinstated at a gallery after the artist complained about being censored.

Photographer Victoria Berekmeri had won an award for the controversial image, which was being shown as part of an exhibition of prizewinners in the South Australian Photography Awards at the National Wine Centre in Adelaide, Australia.

But it was covered with a opaque sheet after some visitors complained it was 'too confronting'.

Shocking: Professional birth photographer Victoria Berekmeri's image of the birth of a baby has caused heated debate

Ms Berekmeri expressed her shock at the image being censored on social media, but negotiated with the Australian Institute of Professional Photographers and the venue to reinstate the image.

It has now been rehung with a content warning, the Herald Sun reported.

Adrian Emeny, the general manager of the National Wine Centre, told the newspaper: 'I understand people's comments but at the end of the day, it's a public 
venue and while some people find it a fabulous photograph, others find 
it a bit confronting.'

While Ms Berekmeri, who is a professional birth photographer, said she was a 'little perturbed' by the censorship.

But she told Mail Online: 'There’s been a
phenomenal response in regards to this image and the debate over 
whether or not this image is appropriate for public viewing is a 
passionate one for many people.

'Through this media frenzy regarding the censorship of my image, we have in fact created an opportunity to challenge social views on birth. I've read hundreds of posts, emails and messages that have warmed, broken and filled my heart in an incredible way.

'This image has transformed people who have held onto pain, or lost those thoughts of joy relating to their experiences with birth. It’s opened people’s minds to the possibility of what’s really acceptable and normal today.

'And it’s reiterated that there will always be the need to give people the choice about whether or not they want to view such realities – even if they are perfectly natural and an everyday occurrence.

'Most importantly though I would like to reiterate the implied respect that is and most deservedly shown towards the mother and child in this photograph.

'Each invitation I have to document one of the most intimate events in a women’s life is an honour and one I deeply respect.'
