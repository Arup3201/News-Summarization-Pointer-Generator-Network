A woman boxer has proved she is a real knock out: she has made the final of a top modelling competition.

Mother-of-two Amy Williams of Port Talbot, South Wales is swapping the boxing ring for the catwalk as she takes on dozens of other young beauties in the final of Top Model UK 2013.

But first she has to get through a big boxing bout - and she's hoping she doesn't take any blows to the face.

Amy Williams, 29, from Port Talbot in South Wales has made the final of a top modelling competition

Amy said: 'It is less make-up and smiles - more sweat and pain.

'I'll have to tap my opponent on the head a few times to score some points. Then I'll just run around the ring.'

'I'm worried but I have to take it as it comes. Whatever happens, happens.'

Amy will step into the ring at the weekend for a novice championship bout for the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association.

And she's hoping not to spoil her good 
looks ahead of her appearance in the final of Top Model UK 2013 at the 
Hilton Metropole in London in April.

'I really didn't feel confident when I went for auditions because it's such a big competition'

Amy, who has made the final of a top modelling competition has to get through a big boxing bout first

She said: 'I don't see any conflict between modelling and getting into the ring.

'I really didn't feel confident when I went for auditions because it's such a big competition but they called me back.

'I'm hoping big things will come from this.'

Top Model UK is Britain's leading professional model search and thousands of women enter each year.

Amy is a finalist in the over 25 category of the competition which has been running for seven years.

Amy, who works as a recruitment consultant, will be cheered on by her proud sons Cameron, 11 and Finley, five.

But Amy, who has been training for six years has had five fights, said she has no intention of giving up the boxing even if she wins the competition.

She said: 'Nothing gives me the buzz that boxing does - I want to prove to myself how good I can be in the ring.'
