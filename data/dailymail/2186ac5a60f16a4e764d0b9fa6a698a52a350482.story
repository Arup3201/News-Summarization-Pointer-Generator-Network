Three family members named in a $100million wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of a Georgia teen who was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat have countersued with a $1million defamation suit. 

Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson filed the wrongful death suit after their son Kendrick was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat at Lowndes High School in Valdosta, Georgia, in January of 2013.

The suit lists 38 defendants and claims that brothers Brian and Branden Bell as well as their father Rick, an FBI agent, were behind the 17-year-old's death.

The Johnsons filed a wrongful death suit after their son Kendrick, 17, was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat

The Bells' countersuit denies any of the three family members were involved in Kendrick's death, according to the Valdosta Daily Times.  

It states the wrongful death suit lacks 'substantial justification' and contains 'a complete absence of any justiciable issue in law or fact'.

Kendrick's parents say the Bells attacked him after their father instructed them to do so

The countersuit also addresses the Johnson family allegedly asking Florida State University to take a football scholarship offer away from younger brother Brian. 

The Bells claim the Johnsons directed a Facebook post at FSU officials which stated Brian 'exhibited violent tendencies and a highly unusual appetite for fighting'.

The post also reportedly said Brian's 'social media activities expose the likelihood of him being a psychopath'.

FSU pulled its offer to the linebacker off the table.

The suit claims similar slanderous statements were made to the University of Louisville and Clemson University.

The Bell brother were notified by US Attorney Michael Moore a federal grand jury's investigation into Johnson's death is targeting them, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. 

The Johnsons' suit, which was filed in DeKalb County Superior Court just after the second anniversary of their son's death, alleges the brothers were 'seeking revenge' after one of them had been in a fight with Kendrick.

It also says the boys acted on a 'parental command' from their father to assault Johnson

The countersuit claims the Johnsons interfered with Brian's chances to play football at Florida State University 

A state autopsy ruled Johnson's death was an accident but his parents have always insisted foul play was involved and there was a cover-up by law enforcement authorities and school officials.

The lawsuit states: 'Defendants from the various law enforcement agencies deliberately and maliciously mishandled the subject investigation in such a way that anyone who might ever be charged with (Johnson's) death would never be convicted.'

Requests for comments from representatives from both families on Sunday did not get a response. 

An attorney for the Bells, Brice Ladson, previously said the lawsuit against his clients was 'frivolous'.

He said: 'The Johnsons know the allegations against my clients are completely baseless.'
