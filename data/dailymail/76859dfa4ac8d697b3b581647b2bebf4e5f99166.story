Parents of sick and premature babies are being offered the chance to keep a watchful eye on them over the internet.

Anxious mothers and fathers will be able to check on their child from outside hospital via a webcam that transmits live footage from the cot to a smartphone or computer.

A pilot project will see the wireless webcams installed at the neonatal intensive care unit at a Scottish hospital.

Potentially, the scheme could be rolled out across the NHS.

New scheme: Anxious parents will be able to check on their sick or premature child from outside hospital via a webcam that transmits live footage from the cot to a smartphone or computer

It is hoped that the BabySam trial at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife, will give parents the confidence to break their bedside vigil to get some rest or carry out errands, knowing that they can check on their child as often as they like.

It is also  hoped that the project will lead to fewer calls to the hospital from worried parents.

Mobile phone giant Samsung is working on the BabySam project with the NHS. The company is providing the camera technology and tablet computers.

Dr Sean Ainsworth, consultant 
paediatrician and neonatologist at the hospital, said: ‘The bonding 
between mother and baby has implications for future development.

‘Sometimes babies are admitted to a special care baby unit because they are either premature or too poorly to remain with their mothers.

We hope BabySam will help overcome geographical isolation by allowing mothers to see  real-time images of their babies, providing reassurance to parents and improving bonding between mother and baby when they cannot physically be together.’

Scottish Health Secretary Alex Neil said: ‘Having a baby in an intensive care unit can be an extremely stressful time for any new parent.

'They will be able to view their baby and feel connected to them while they receive vital treatment.’

Dr Rhona Hogg, a childcare expert at Edinburgh Napier University, will research the impact of the BabySam system on bonding.

She said she hoped it would reduce separation anxiety for premature infants.
