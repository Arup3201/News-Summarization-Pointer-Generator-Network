After hundreds of battered Range Rovers, Jaguars and Porches rolled off the stricken cargo ship the sole £260,000 Rolls Royce on board emerged without a scratch. 

The Hoegh Osaka was bound for Bremerhaven in Germany with 1,400 luxury cars on January 3, when it was deliberately grounded on Bramble Bank in the Solent to stop it capsizing.

Its cargo arrived back into Southampton Port with 'limited damage', but the ship owners says it is unable to confirm the future of the vehicles after fears were raised that the entire fleet would need to be scrapped.

Unscathed: The single Rolls Royce Wraith, worth £260,000 emerged from the Hoegh Osaka in pristine condition after the ship began to list

Lined up: Row upon row of expensive cars, which have been taken off the stricken ship, wait in the dock's yard to be assessed by engineers

More than two weeks after the Singapore-registered vessel was stranded off the Hampshire coast, ship owners Hoegh Autoliners began the work of unloading the goods, which included 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, 65 Mini cars and 105 pieces of JCB construction equipment.

And surprisingly, among the dented doors and scratched paintwork sat a single Rolls Royce Wraith, destined for private owners believed to be in the Middle East - the final destination for the ship, which arrived in pristine condition.

The incident happened after an excavator on one of the decks had shifted, punching a hole in the hull and causing 3,000 tonnes of water to flood some of the car decks - leaving a some of the vehicles under water.

The ship, which has 12 decks, was just a third full when it left the English coast and was expected to pick up more cargo when it arrived at the German port, before heading to its final destination in the Middle East.

Damaged: Another plastic-covered Range Rover is driven off the Singapore-registered vehicle into Southampton's Docks where it waits for assessment

Ruined: A loader transports other seriously damaged vehicles - some of which had been submerged in water - off the ill-fated vessel

A spokesman for the ship owners said the Osaka had come from India to the UK and that 'the majority of the cargo was headed for the Far and Middle East' where it was likely to go on to a range of dealers and some private owners.

He said: 'These ships are used for transporting very big equipment and we are chartered with transporting the cargo. Höegh Autoliners has no right to decide on the future of the cargo.

'We need our ship back so that we can fix it and that;s going to happen in Southampton. We are going through the process of removing the cargo, which needs to go and be reviewed and engineers are looking at a variety of cars and equipment which has already been offloaded. 

'It presents a logistical issue for the owners of the cars about what to do next.' He added that the discharge operation is expected to continue into next week.

Concerns over the fleets future were raised after a similar accident in 2006 wrecked 4,700 Mazdas. The cars were sent to the crusher after transporter MV Cougar Ace partially capsized in the North Pacific while carrying the cars away from the factory.

Battered: A Mini Cooper with a dented door is driver from the ship. It is one of 65 Minis that were on board at the time the ship started to list

Wrecked: The ship's owners said there was 'limited damage' to most of the 1,400 luxury vehicles, however, plenty rolled off with doors missing

It was left resting for just over three weeks - a similar length of time to the Hoegh Osaka - at an angle of 60 degrees.

Initially a Mazda spokesman said that only 68 cars had been damaged in the crash, either by slipping their moorings or rolling into other vehicles, but it was eventually decided that all 4,700 vehicles needed to be crushed.

Engineers were worried about what effect resting at such a severe angle for so long would have on the inner workings of the cars, especially on the electrolyte in the batteries.

Rather than open themselves up to the possibility of lawsuits due to mechanical faults, the company decided that it was safer to scrap the lot.

Sturdy: The massive tank was among hundreds of heavy equipment on board including 105 pieces of construction equipment

The Osaka was deliberately run aground after it started to list at 52 degrees, a similar angle to the Cougar Ace, just after leaving Southampton port. If it is decided that all the vehicles need to be disposed of then the total bill will run into the tens of millions of pounds. 

High winds and heavy rain hampered the rescue operation - even causing one of the tugs to smash into the Osaka as it was being towed. 

It is not yet known which vehicles were damaged by the sea water inside the ship and the spokesman said the vehicles were owned by 'a variety of parties' - including dealers and private owners. Cars which are damaged or do not start up will be towed off the ship. 

The 25 person crew had to be rescued by RNLI lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter with two people suffering non-life threatening injuries during the incident.

The cargo ship, which is 180 metres long and 32 metres wide, finally arrived back in Southampton on January 22.

A spokeswoman from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) confirmed they were investigating what had caused the large vessel to list so dramatically. 

January 3, 8.30pm - The Hoegh Osaka, a Singapore-registered ship, left the port of Southampton  bound for Bremerhaven in Germany.The 180 metre long ship was bound for Germany, and loaded with 1,400 cars including Land Rovers, Jaguars and a £260,000 Rolls Royce.

January 3, 9.20pm - About 45 minutes after it left the port the 15 year old ship started to list badly at 52 degrees. It was deliberately grounded by the crew, near the Isle of Wight in Hampshire, to prevent it capsizing. A rescue operation was then launched to rescue the captain and 25 crew members. It is understood the cargo ship, which has a nine-metre draught, turned sharply to the left as it passed the notorious Bramble Bank sandbank near Cowes and ran aground. Following the incident a 200 metre exclusion zone was set up around the ship, to prevent other vessels interfering with the tugs. 

January 5 - Salvage experts unsuccessfully tried to re-float the huge ship by using four tugs to pull it off the sandbank.

The Hoegh Osaka was deliberately grounded in the Solent, around 20 minutes into its journey, after it started listing at 52 degrees 

January 7 - The ship was floated from Bramble Bank on the high tide and tugs were used to tow it to Alpha Anchorage near Lee-on-the-Solent.

January 10 - One of the tugs crashed into the ship during a period of high winds.An excavator that was on board shifted during the sailing and punched a hole in the side of the hull, which was quickly repaired. But some 3,000 tonnes of water entered the vessel.

January 17 - The 3,000 tonnes of water was pumped out and into empty fuel tanks on board.

January 22 - Salvage firm Svitzer was able to complete ballast management and reduce the ship's list to five degrees. It was then towed to Southampton Docks by four tugs.During its journey, an exclusion zone around the vessel was in place, set at 1,000 metres ahead and behind and 100 metres either side. Airspace was also restricted to one mile around the route as a precaution. Hundreds of people gathered at Southampton Water to watch the ship complete its three hour journey back to the port. 

January 27 - luxury cars, including Range Rovers and a Porsche, started to be driven off the ship.
