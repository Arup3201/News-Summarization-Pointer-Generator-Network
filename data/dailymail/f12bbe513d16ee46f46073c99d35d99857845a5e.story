Fiat heir Lapo Elkann has accused celebrity chef Travis London of stalking him, and lying in tweets in which he claimed the two had an affair.

London said in a tweet earlier this month, 'Lapo Elkann is a true creative and a great friend, a great man, and a GREAT lover.'

He added that Elkann would 'always be one of my greatest loves and I only wish for him the very best in life' and in a third post described the style-savvy billionaire as 'the most incredible person I have ever known.'

Twitter love: London said in a series of tweets, pictured, earlier this month, 'Lapo Elkann is a true creative and a great friend, a great man, and a GREAT lover'

'I want to thank him for loving me and allowing me to be crazy,' the chef, who has been romantically linked to Rihanna and Mary-Kate Olsen, went on.

The tweets were later deleted, but not before The Dirty posted them.

But Elkann has vehemently denied any affair and accused London of stalking him.

Elkann told The New York Post's Page Six: 'The reality is he is a stalker, and he is someone who is obsessed with me ... Whatever he is saying ... is a nuisance and unreal. He has been stalking [me] for a year and a half.'

Elkann even threatened to take legal action against the chef.

London seemed to be shocked at the 37-year-old's hostile response.

'I am very saddened that Lapo would choose to say such slanderous lies about me,' he told Page Six.

'We clearly knew each other very intimately (and) Lapo will always be someone who I love very dearly and who I miss every day.'

Elkann, the great-great grandson of Fiat founder Giovanni Agnelli, is not new to controversy.

In late 2005, during a night out in Turin, Italy, he ended up overdosing on a potentially lethal mixture of drugs while in the company of some transsexuals.Â 

Luckily, one of them - a quick-thinking 54-year-old - saved his life by calling an ambulance.

The New York-born Elkann left Italy where he was working in the design department of the family business but returned the following year to set up a lifestyle and clothing company.

The member of the Vanity Fair's Best Dressed Hall of Fame, who previously dated female billionaire Goga Ashkenazi, was in japan and China last month promoting a new capsule collection of suits he designed with Gucci.
