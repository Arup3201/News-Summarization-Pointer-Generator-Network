Argentina was accused last night of whipping up more tension over the Falkland Islands by naming its forthcoming football season after the General Belgrano.

The country’s domestic league, which kicks off on Friday, will be known as the Crucero General Belgrano First Division.

The sinking of the cruiser by a Royal Navy submarine with the loss of 323 Argentine lives was a defining moment of the Falklands War.

Sunk: Argentina's domestic football league will be named after the doomed cruiser General Belgrano which was torpedoed by HMS Conqueror in 1982 with the loss of 323 Argentine lives

With the 30th anniversary of the conflict imminent and the two countries engaged in a new war of words over the islands’ future, some observers felt there could hardly have been a more emotive choice of titles for its sporting showpiece.

In a further twist, the league’s winners will receive a trophy named in honour of an Argentine who murdered five Falklanders.

It will be called the Gaucho Rivero – 
after Antonio ‘El Gaucho’ Rivero, a Falklands resident who killed a 
group of British settlers in 1833.

Guy Opperman, a Tory MP who has called for Britain and Argentina to have better relations, said the latest actions were inflammatory.

‘This really is a retrograde step,’ he added. ‘There are 40million Argentinians and 3,000 Falkland islanders.

'Clearly they should try to get on without Argentina trying to inflame matters on a regular basis.’

Tony Davies of the Falklands Veterans Foundation said: ‘This is just another pathetic attempt to keep up the agitation on the islanders and disrupt life.

Thank God we in this country would never dream of dishonouring our fallen comrades in such a way.’

Horacio Oulton, who survived the torpedo attack on the Belgrano, said he applauded the move.

‘It will ensure that Argentina’s desire to take the islands back will never fade,’ he said.

‘It will only ignite the fire inside everyone to see justice done, and the blue and white flag fly over the Malvinas again.’

The Belgrano was torpedoed by the Royal Navy submarine Conqueror on May 2, 1982.

Although it was claimed that the ship was heading away from the islands, recently released documents suggest it was heading for them.
