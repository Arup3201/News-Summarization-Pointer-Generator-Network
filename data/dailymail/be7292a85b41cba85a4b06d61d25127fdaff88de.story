Hacked Off’s chief lobbyist had a special parliamentary pass for eight months without declaring that he worked with the pressure group.

John Dickinson-Lilley began helping the organisation in November and played a key role in persuading politicians to back new laws restricting the freedom of the Press.

Until earlier this week he was listed on the House of Lords register as deputy head of public policy at Sense, a charity for deaf and  dumb people.

But he left that role last October and under parliamentary rules, the register should have been updated within a month of him starting work at Hacked Off, the campaign fronted by actor Hugh Grant.

It was not until two days ago, after being contacted by journalists, that Mr Dickinson-Lilley called the registrar at the House of Lords and asked for the register to be updated.

Mr Dickinson-Lilley, a top blind ski racer, obtained his pass through Lord Low of Dalston, who worked with him three years ago at the Royal National Institute of Blind people.

The peer, vice president of the RNIB, is a strong supporter of Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendations on press regulation and in a Lords debate in January said press  freedom must be seen as a ‘qualified freedom.’

Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said:  ‘It is ironical that (Lord Low and  Mr Dickinson-Lilley) were arguing for increased regulation yet they couldn’t meet their own regulatory requirements.

‘Concern has been expressed about possible abuses to the parliamentary pass system both from the lobbying point of view and from a security point of view.

‘It is of crucial importance that all the official people actually know  and are fully aware about the circumstances under which a pass has  been issued.’ 

Lord Low said: ‘I counter-signed John Dickinson-Lilley’s form updating his details of employment in December 2012. This was submitted by John in person to the pass office whose role is, in the case of an existing pass holder, to pass it on to the Lords Registrar of Interest so that Category 1 can be updated.

‘It is regrettable that his form seems to have been lost.’ 

Hacked Off said Mr Dickinson- Lilley’s role had been disclosed on its website, adding: ‘John meets with Lord Low regularly to advise him on special educational needs issues.’
