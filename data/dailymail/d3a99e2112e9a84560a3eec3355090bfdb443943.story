A computer programmer bragged on Facebook that he was the first person in the world to pirate a copy of the movie Fast & Furious 6 – but was caught after he used his hacker name on his dating profile.

Philip Danks, 25, secretly filmed the sixth installment of the Hollywood action movie at a cinema in Walsall, West Midlands, on its UK release date and illegally uploaded it on the internet, costing Universal Pictures an estimated £2.3million.

Fraud investigators quickly traced him after they noticed his online ‘Thecod3r’ tag attached to the video was identical to his profile on dating site Plenty of Fish.

Philip Danks, 25, bragged on Facebook he was the first person to pirate a copy of the Fast and Furious 6 movie

He was arrested by police after a special ‘webwatch’ team was set up by LA-based Universal Pictures, who raided his home in Bloxwich, Walsall on May 23 – less than a week after the video surfaced online.

Danks even took to Facebook two days later to brag: ‘Seven billion people and I was the first. F*** you Universal Pictures.’

And while on police bail, he continued to sell dozens of illegal films – including the Fast and Furious 6 – for £1.50 each.

He pleaded guilty to three charges of distributing pirate copies of films and was jailed for 33 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court yesterday.

The court heard he made £1,000 from selling copies of the film but his dealings cost Universal Pictures an estimated £2.3million after 779,000 people were able to download it for free.

Sentencing Recorder Keith Raynor said: ‘This was bold, arrogant and cocksure offending.

‘You approach to the film industry was made clear in the posting you made on Facebook two days after your arrest.

‘I accept the personal profit was modest but the real seriousness of this case is the loss caused to the film industry as a whole.’

Ari Alibhai, prosecuting on behalf of the Federation Against Copyright Theft, said Danks had recorded the film at a Showcase Cinema in Walsall on May 17, 2013.

He then uploaded it onto the internet via his personal website Bit Buddy the following day after converting the pirated camcorder version into a digital copy.

Mr Alibhaid said: ‘The film was Universal Picture's most significant release of that year with both the biggest production costs and expected revenue.

‘The estimated loss to the industry caused by the defendant's actions is conservatively estimated at £2.3m but he did not receive money from the on line distribution.’

The court heard that despite making some money from sales of the film on Facebook and by personal delivery his real motive was ‘street cred’.

He added: ‘The first person with a pirated version attracts much kudos.

‘He wanted recognition from the community.’

Danks, who has given lessons on computer programming on YouTube, had to watch the film twice at the cinema on the same day because the camcorder battery ran out on the first visit. 

He used his Facebook page to brag just two days after his arrest saying that he was the first to pirate the movie - and was still openly posting comments on social media about his conviction up until last month (above)

Danks advertised his services through his Facebook page, selling illegal movies individually or in bundles and is said to have made £1,000 from the Fast and Furious movie, costing Universal Pictures an estimated £2.3million

His copy had been picked up by ExtraTorrent – one of the world’s largest pirate film sites – and it was spotted by Universal’s webwatch team.

Investigators put his distinctive 'tag' into an internet search engine and discovered he had also used it on Plenty of Fish where his proper name and age were also recorded.

In his dating profile he describes himself as ‘smokes often with average body type’ and says his personality is a ‘techie’.

He also says he is 5ft 10, non-religious and works as a member of bar staff and his longest relationship was less than a year.

He uploaded pictures to the site including him singing karaoke with a friend (left) and holding a baby (right)

It states: ‘I like to go fishing and play poker when I can. I drive, I work (most of the time). I like listening to R&B, Garage, Bassline, Pop and anything in-between. I like watching comedies and romance films mainly but will watch pretty much anything.’

His computer and three rack servers - needed to download films faster - were seized and taken away for analysis when police raided his home.

Mr Christopher Loach, defending, said: ‘He has no real qualifications and is not a man of means.

Danks had to visit twice on the same day after the camera he was using ran out of battery the first time round

‘He has no substantial assets of any sort and his financial gain has been extremely limited but he was obviously aware that it was a popular film that would be of interest.’

A second version of his copy was also uploaded onto the internet under his direction by a friend, Michael Bell.

Bell, from Aldridge, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to one offence of distributing a pirate copy of a film and was given a 12 month community order with 120 hours unpaid work

Danks kept people posted on the case through Facebook - where he is seen pictured with fast sport cars similar to those in the film, which starred Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.

On the day before the hearing he posted: ‘Going to try and get some sleep now, 2 important events tomorrow! 1 is to determine my fate and find out if I am going to prison, the other (if court goes well) will be playing in the biggest tournament of my life, a $700 & hopefully a $2100 tournament to fight for a spot in the EPT 11 London Main Event on October 8th! #Nervous’.

Makers of the Fast & Furious 6, Universal Pictures, say his actions cos them £2.3million after he filmed the movie on its opening day in UK cinemas

But while awaiting sentence, he conceded in another post: ‘Not loking (sic) good’.

After the case Kieron Sharp, director general of FACT said: ‘Thousands of people are employed making some of the world's most famous and popular films.

‘Their livelihoods are at risk if a film is unable to create the profits needed to fund future films.

‘This is an important case and an important sentence.

‘Danks was responsible for recording, uploading and distributing the film and was clearly unconcerned at the time about the consequences of his actions, perhaps believing that the internet gave him anonymity.’

Chris Marcich form the The Motion Picture Association of America said: ‘Online copyright infringement represents a significant threat to the continued success of the UK's creative industries and to the continued development of legal sources of film and TV content.

‘It is important that those making money on the back of other people's hard work and creativity, paying nothing back into the creative economy, are held accountable.’

Detective Sergeant Rod Rose, from West Midlands Police's Economic Crime Unit, added: ‘Fraud comes in many guises and ultimately affects all of us.

‘There are lots of agencies involved in stopping offenders and when they identify potential criminal offences we will always try to offer our support.’
