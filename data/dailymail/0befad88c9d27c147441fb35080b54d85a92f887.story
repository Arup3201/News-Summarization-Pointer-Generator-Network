Prime Minister David Cameron's brother Alex claimed today a major fraud trial should be thrown out - because of legal-aid reforms

Prime Minister David Cameron's barrister brother claimed today a major fraud trial should be thrown out because of legal-aid reforms introduced by his sibling's government.

Alex Cameron QC, who is representing seven defendants free of charge, argues that his legally aided clients could not find barristers 'of sufficient competence'.

Scott Crawley, 35, is said to have masterminded a £5million scam between 2008 and 2011 through the firms Plott UK, European Property Investments (EPI) and Stirling Alexander.

He is accused alongside Daniel 
Forsyth, 30, Ross Peters, 27, Aaron Petrou, 46, Ricky Mitchie, 24, Adam 
Hawkins, 28, and Brendan Daley, 38, of conspiracy to defraud.

Mr Cameron does not represent Mr Forsyth.

The
 eighth defendant, solicitor Dale Walker, 53, is facing fraud charges 
and an allegation of money laundering in relation to the case.

The
 charges arose out of Operation Cotton, a Financial Conduct Authority 
investigation into the activities of the land banking firms.

All
 three firms involved have now been wound up, either voluntarily or in 
the face of civil proceedings brought in the last two years by the FCA.

Today, Mr Cameron asked for the prosecution to be stopped, blaming the situation created by legal-aid cuts.

He told Southwark Crown Court: 'The 
issue before the court today comes down, it seem to us, to this - 
whether the court accedes to the defence application, that the case 
should be stayed, or whether it accedes to the Crown's response to that,
 that there should be an adjournment... of eight months until January.

'The
 problem of lack of adequate representation or potential lack of 
adequate representation has been apparent since at least, we would 
submit, 14 November, 2013.

'The
 state has failed to provide adequate representation to enable the trial
 to take place today, or indeed in this window, and it is now agreed 
that a trial cannot take place without adequate representation.'

Mr Cameron said there appeared to be no available lawyers of 'sufficient competence and skill'.

He said the title 'Queen's Counsel' 
was 'a kite-mark' of quality but that not enough could be found, who 
were willing to for the Public Defender Service.

Nor could independent barristers be found, since they are refusing to work under current legal-aid rates.

'At the moment we understand that there is only one identified silk available at the moment to conduct this trial, were it adjourned until January.'

He added: 'Two unidentified silks' might be available later in the year, but this was still inadequate. Something has to give.

'What we submit is that in this case, the state has known about the problem, hasn't addressed the problem... so that it's now forced to ask for an adjournment.'

Mr Cameron said the Crown wished to put the case 'on the never-never'. But he made clear he was concerned with the broader implications of the argument.

'We do attribute the fault to the state more widely,' Mr Cameron said. 'The problem is this case is not the only case that has this problem.

'At the moment there is a finite resource [of barristers] and too much capacity required.

'Is the position going to be that this case should swallow up the available silks...so that these other cases are adjourned or stayed?'

Prosecutor Ben Emmerson QC replied: 'The situation that now faces the court is an unusual one. 'A stay is not an appropriate order and certainly never [is], when there is an alternate remedy available.

'Neither of the standard categories of abuse [of process] apply.'

Mr Emmerson made clear that a recipient of legal-aid 'is not entitled to a choice of representation'.

Judge Anthony Leonard QC asked whether a defendant may be entitled to choose from a 'pool' of barristers instead. Mr Emmerson replied there was nothing in the jurisprudence to support this idea.

The Justice Secretary, Chris Grayling, has overseen wholesale reform to the legal aid system, leading to dismay from the Criminal Bar.

Barristers and solicitors have already been hit with 30 per cent fee cuts in the most serious cases, prompting walk-outs and demonstrations.

Further reforms are set to introduce a two-tier contracting arrangement that vastly reduce the amount of law firms able to claim taxpayer funding.

Mr Grayling has previously said: 'As everybody knows this government is dealing with an unprecedented financial challenge and I have no choice but to look for the savings I have to make across the full range of the MoJ's work.

'I cannot exempt legal aid from this, but that doesn't mean I don't understand how challenging these reductions will be.

'Legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but we must ensure it is sustainable for those who need it, for those who provide legal services as part of it and for the taxpayer, who ultimately pays for it.'

Crawley, of Beckenham, Kent, Forsyth, of Bromley, Peters, of Penge, south London, Petrou and Mitchie, both Orpington, Kent, Walker, of Brighton, Daley, Chislehurst, Kent, and Hawkins, of New Eltham, are all facing charges of conspiracy to defraud and carry on a regulated activity when not authorised.

Walker faces a separate charge of money laundering.

The hearing continues.
