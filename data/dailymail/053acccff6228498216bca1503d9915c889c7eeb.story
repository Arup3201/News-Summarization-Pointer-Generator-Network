Roy Hodgson must convince Saido Berahino that his international future is with England after the forward received an official approach from Burundi.

Berahino, who has scored 16 times for West Brom in the Barclays Premier League this season, was called into the England squad for the first time in November.

The striker was born in Burundi and a delegation of officials from the tiny country in south-east Africa have been courting him this week.

Burundi, 126th in the FIFA rankings, play Mauritius in a friendly on March 25 and want to name the West Brom forward in their squad.

England’s head coach names his squad on Thursday for the Euro 2016 clash with Lithuania on March 27 at Wembley and the friendly in Turin against Italy four days later.

Berahino has yet to represent the England team and he would still be permitted to switch nationalities under FIFA rules.

Hodgson’s striking options have been swelled by the return from injury of Daniel Sturridge, along with regular forwards Danny Welbeck and England captain Wayne Rooney.

Hodgson has already made it clear that he intends to select Tottenham forward Harry Kane when he names his squad at the national stadium next week.

Kane, who is the Spurs squad travelling to Manchester United on Sunday, has scored 16 times in the Barclays Premier League and was named player of the month for the second time on Friday.

His emergence means Hodgson has a dilemma over who to select as his fifth striker. Berahino, an England Under-21 international, was named in the full squad for the first time in November for the clashes with Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier and the friendly with Scotland at Celtic Park.

He was an unused substitute in both games, but Hodgson predicted a bright future for the forward after he spent a week training with the national team.
