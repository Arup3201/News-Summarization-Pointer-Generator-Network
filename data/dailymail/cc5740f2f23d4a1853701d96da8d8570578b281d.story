The girlfriend of a suspect in a New Hampshire murder case has been arrested for lying to police about her whereabouts on the night when the missing college student was last seen.

Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Marriott went missing on October 9 and may have been involved in a kinky threesome with Seth Mazzaglia and his girlfriend Kathryn McDonough.

Mazzaglia, an aspiring 29-year-old actor, remains in police custody and is charged with the second dregree murder of 19-year-old Marriott even though her body has never been found.

Charged: Kathryn McDonough, 19, seen at her arraignment (left) and arrest (right) was charged with lying to the police about her whereabouts on the night that a supposed friend went missing

Support: McDonough's parents watched in court as their daughter's bail was set for $35,000

McDonough, also 19, was dating Mazzaglia at the time and investigators believe that she is the connection between the seemingly wholesome Marriott and Mazzaglia who is thought to be a member of various online dating and bondage websites.

Marriott was a student at the University of New Hampshire, and her friends said that on the day that she disappeared, she had told them that she was going to visit a friend in a town called Dover.

McDonough- who lived in an apartment with Mazzaglia in Dover- and Marriott previously worked together at Target and became friends there.

Marriott's aunt said Lizzi loved marine biology, volunteered at the New England Aquarium in Boston and enjoyed reading the Harry Potter series and The Lord of the Rings trilogy with her younger brother.

McDonough was arrested on Christmas 
Eve for hindering apprehension or prosecution and conspiracy to commit 
hindering apprehension or prosecution, both of which are felony charges.

The Union Leader reports that 
McDonough was arrested- which comes two months after Mazzaglia was 
arrested for suffocating Marriot- because she lied about where she was 
on October 9 and 12. Her bail has been set at $35,000.

Marriott's body has not been recovered
so far. Divers equipped with sonar and underwater cameras have been 
scouring the ocean for the teen.

'We truly believe she’s in the ocean, 
and we're just waiting for her to come back to shore,' said Dawn Downey 
of Westboro, a family friend.

Though the search was briefly called 
off, authorities have no focused their efforts on the waters around 
Peirce Island in nearby Portsmouth using both sonar technology to scan 
the bottom of the lake and cadaver dogs to try to pick up her scent.

Authorities in Maine and Massachusetts have also been asked to watch their shorelines in case  Marriott's body washes up.

But that was the last activity on her phone and her bank accounts have not been accessed since.

The suspect, Seth J. Mazzaglia is listed as living at apartment 341 in the complex of 1 Mill Street in Dover.

His website indicates that he is an 
'experienced actor, writer and fight choreographer' who stands 5 feet 9 
inches tall and weighs 220 pounds.

He claims that his 'special skills and
talents' include a third degree black belt in Okinawan karate and that 
he is proficient with a samurai sword, butterfly swords and other hand 
held weapons.

Robert Modee, who is a Kittery, Maine,
martial arts instructor, confirmed that Mazzaglia is an expert in 
karate and that he trained with the suspect for almost 20-years.

'He's been with me, training with me, since he was probably 10 or 12 years old,' Modee said.

As well as his expertise in 
hand-to-hand combat, Mazzaglia claimed to have performed in 17 theater 
productions between 2000 and 2010.

In 2005, Mazzaglia played the role of 
Richie Valens in a July performance of The Buddy Holly Story, at 
Seacoast Repertory Theater.

One former cast member, Brett Wulfson said she remembered Mazzaglia as a pleasant man, 'very involved with self-defense'.

Fruitless: A Portsmouth fire boat joins the search of the Piscataqua River in New Hampshire for the body of student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott, which has since been called off

Strangled: Lizzi's body has still not been found but police have called off the search. They will not say what led to her arrest but simply it was due to evidence collected

According to The Portsmouth Herald, 
Mazzaglia had several accounts on online dating sites, including 
OKCupid.com, where his user name was listed as DarKaiser.

Another account of a 29-year-old 
DarKaiser was found on an S&M website described as 'the world's 
largest largest BDSM (bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, and
sadomasochism) community and the most exciting bondage and fetish Web 
site.'

The user by the name DarKaiser wrote in his profile that he is 'a master seeking a slave.'

On another bondage website described 
as a Facebook 'run by kinksters,' a 29-year-old DarKaiser from New 
Hampshire wrote that he was looking for 'a lifetime relationship, a 
relationship; a play partner' princess by day, slut by night' and a 
sub.'

In addition, Mazzaglia claims to have a 750 hour certification in massage therapy awarded by McIntosh College in 2007.

Marriott was a 2011 graduate of 
Westborough High School in Massachusetts. She lived with an aunt in 
Chester and commuted to the Durham campus.
