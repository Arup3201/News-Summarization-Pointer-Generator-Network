Former Real Madrid and Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka has announced he has joined Mumbai City in the Indian Super League.

It had been reported that the 35-year-old, without a club since leaving West Brom following his ban for using the quenelle gesture, has agreed a short-term deal with the new ISL franchise, managed by Peter Reid.

'I'm pleased to join Mumbai City FC & very exciting in joining Indian Super League,' Anelka wrote on Twitter.

'Talented international players & top Indian talent will make matches thrilling affairs.

'I look forward to using my ability to do well for my team in the matches we will play.'

Anelka, capped 69 times by France, began his career with Paris St Germain before joining Arsenal as a youngster, going on to play for Real Madrid, Manchester City, Fenerbahce, Bolton, Chelsea, Shanghai Shenhua, Juventus and West Brom in an often nomadic career marked by highs and lows.
