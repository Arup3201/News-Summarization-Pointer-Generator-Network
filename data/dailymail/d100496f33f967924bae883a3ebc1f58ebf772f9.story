TV host Scott Rogers was 'shot dead' by Matthew Hodgkinson, his son-in-law and former lover, in a 'murder and attempted suicide' on Wednesday at his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana

A British dance teacher who who was accused of molesting a pupil and running a 'cult'-like school is believed to have been shot dead in his US home by his son-in-law - who was also his former lover.

It is thought Scott Rogers, 52, was killed by Mathew Hodgkinson in a 'murder and attempted suicide' in his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Wednesday, according to local police.

Mr Hodgkinson, 36, was married to Mr Rogers' daughter Kimmy, and it has been suggested that all three lived in the home where Mr Rogers was shot.

Mr Rogers, originally from Suffolk, was well-known in the city as the host of his own weekend show on a local television channel.

He founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983. He was known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK.

The school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County 
Council bosses, who in 1995 warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending 
children to the school.

On Thursday two men alleged that Mr Rogers sexually abused them as young boys - one said he was a former pupil of the dance academy.

Police said that Mr Hodgkinson survived the 'murder and attempted suicide' and is now in a coma in Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Baton Rouge.

Iberville Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi, investigating the shooting, said the home had been the scene of a 'bunch of stress' in the past several weeks.

He said: 'It looked like a murder and failed attempted suicide. Scott was shot in his bed, under the covers, tucked neatly in.

'It looks like Mathew put the gun to his own head... he was seriously wounded but still alive. He's still in a critical condition in an induced coma. It's been topsy-turvy at this residence.

'We responded to a couple of calls. It's been a high stress environment for this family and looks like it culminated in this.'

Mr Stassi said his deputy found a note next to the bed. He said: 'We think Mathew wrote it and maybe even put it there after Scott was deceased.'

On Thursday two men, appearing anonymously on a Louisiana radio show, alleged that Scott Rogers sexually abused them as young boys.

One
 of the victims, who who said he met Mr Rogers at his dance academy, 
claimed to have been intimately involved with Mr Rogers from the 
age of 13. He said that the encounters 'increased in frequency' until he
 was 
18. The other victim described him as a 'monster'.

In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993.

In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult' .

It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.'

At the time headteacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cul-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts. Some of our pupils have moved on to appear in the West End theatre and on television.

'People are still coming here for classes from all over Suffolk. We are not involved in any cult activities and to say we are is ridiculous.'
