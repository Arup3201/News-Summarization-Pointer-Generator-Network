Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner is due in England before the end of the week as he presses ahead with plans to sell the club.

Lerner has entered into discussion with a consortium over a proposed £150million sale of the Midlands club.

And Sportsmail understands Lerner is expected to fly into Birmingham over the coming days for further discussions regarding a sale.

Talks over a takeover are understood to be at an advanced stage and Lerner’s decision to fly into England is viewed as a key step towards the completion of a deal.

The consortium is in the due diligence stage of their proposed takeover, though the eventual price of the sale will depend on which league Villa are playing in next season.

Lerner wants to receive his full £150m asking price 

Lerner’s expected arrival in the Midlands comes after it emerged Lerner’s Midlands property has been made available as part of the takeover. The farmhouse, located in Bodymoor Heath, is understood to be worth in the region of £3m.

Lerner has been keen to sell Villa for some time, a period that has seen the club go through a difficult period on the pitch.

The sacking of Paul Lambert and subsequent arrival of Tim Sherwood has helped stimulate the club, as has their pending FA Cup semi-final.

But Villa are still in danger of dropping into the second tier of English football for the first time since 1987.

Lerner is desperate for the team to avoid that scenario as he looks to receive his full £150m asking price.

Relegation into the Championship would severely lower Villa’s value, possibly as much as half. The consortium expect to complete their takeover soon after the end of the season.
