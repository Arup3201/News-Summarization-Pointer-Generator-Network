A teenager chopping wood has had an extra-TREErestrial encounter by spotting the face of everyone's favourite alien in a tree trunk.

Jake Dowd was about to light the log burner at his home in Temple Newsam, West Yorkshire, when he noticed the face of E.T. staring back at him.

The 17-year-old was dare not burn the trunk which bears such striking resemblance to the character from the Steven Spielberg film.

Jake Dowd was just about to put the piece of wood into a burner when he noticed the face of E.T. grained in the trunk

E.T. still far from home: The face of the alien from the Steven Spielberg film appeared in the wood's grain pattern

Jake said: 'I was shocked how much it resembled E.T. We haven't decided what to do with the log yet - but it won't be going on the fire.

'We might sell it, maybe a fan might want to buy it.

'I have seen the film, and I really like it, so I knew who it was E.T. as soon as I saw it. It looks so like him.

'It is really unique, E.T. is our favorite alien now. We have even been on E.T. ride at Universal Studios in the States and my dad loved it.

Jake and his dad Tony, 49, were getting logs together on Saturday when they caught sight of the strange log.

Apprentice Jake said: 'We get logs delivered and it was in with them.'

Still trying to phone home: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was an instant hit in 1982 and held the record for the largest-grossing film for 10 years

Ken Dobson spotted the alien's face while chopping wood in his garden last year

Another spotting occurred in Danbury Country Park, near Chelmsford, Essex

Spookily, his encounter is not the first time the alien's face has appeared in pieces of wood.

Last year, another man spotted the lovable alien's face while chopping wood in his garden.

Ken Dobson of Wiltshire, said: 'I was just carving this wood up with my chainsaw and this was one of the last logs of the big pile.

'We dusted it off and said: "Gosh look at that, it's ET". I was amazed - the likeness really is uncanny.

And like Jake, the Dobsons couldn't quite bear to burn the extra-terrestrial's face in a fire.

Another man spotted the alien in a tree trunk in a country park in Essex, while Peter Burford and his wife, from Eldersfield, Gloucestershire, kept a piece of a tree that they were chopping for firewood in February 2011.

ET: The Extra-terrestrial became the highest-grossing film of all time - a record it held for ten years.

It ranks as the greatest science fiction film ever made, in a survey by movie website Rotten Tomatoes.

The film was re-released in 1985, and then again in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary.
