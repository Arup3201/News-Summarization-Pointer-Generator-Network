Ill: The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, is suffering from an advanced form of prostate cancer, he disclosed yesterday

The Archbishop of York is suffering from an advanced form of prostate cancer, he disclosed yesterday.

Dr John Sentamu, 63, said he had undergone surgery, adding: ‘I will be out of action for some time.’ 

His absence from the ruling councils of the Church of England means the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Justin Welby, will be without the support of the number two in the Church’s hierarchy at a crucial time.

The Anglican hierarchy is currently trying to negotiate its way through deep turmoil over same-sex marriage law and its leaders’ efforts to secure the promotion of women bishops.

It was not previously known that the archbishop had cancer.

In a statement, Dr Sentamu said: ‘I am thankful and grateful for Mr Bill Cross, and his surgical team at St James’s Hospital, Leeds, who today operated on me for a locally-advanced cancer of the prostate.

‘I am also grateful to the nursing staff who are caring from me. I am thankful, too, for all of you who regularly pray for me and support me, especially my staff at Bishopthorpe Palace.

‘I will be out of action for some time and will continue to value your prayers. I look forward to resuming my ministry as soon as possible.’

In 2011 Dr Sentamu spent nearly two weeks in St Thomas’ Hospital in London after suffering complications following an operation to remove his appendix.

Ugandan-born Dr Sentamu, who came to Britain after opposing the regime of dictator Idi Amin in his home country, has combined fierce criticism of racism with stern opposition to the influence of left-wing multiculturalism and secular attacks on Christian institutions such as Christmas.

He no longer wears a dog collar in public in protest against authoritarian rule in Zimbabwe and has vowed not to wear one again until ruler Robert Mugabe has gone.

In the 1990s while a junior bishop in 
East London he worked as a key assistant to Sir William Macpherson on 
the inquiry into the murder of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence. He served 
as Bishop of Birmingham before his appointment to York.

One of his most recent public actions was to restate his determination that English people should celebrate their patron saint St George.

Dr Sentamu’s statement said he was drawing great comfort from words attributed to the German Lutheran pastor and theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was shot by the Nazis in April 1945.

‘God, gather and turn my thoughts to you. With you there is light, you do not forget me. With you there is hope and patience. I don’t understand your ways, but you know the way for me.’ The Archbishop said: ‘I wish you all joy in the Lord.’
