Cougar: A new study has found that more Victorian women had toy-boy husbands than today's women

The 'cougar' - or an older women who dates or marries a younger man - may seem like a modern phenomenon but new research shows that there were more women with toy-boy husbands in Victorian times than there are today.

A study of census data by genealogy website Ancestry.co.uk also showed that there were more single mothers in 19th century Britain than there are in the UK now.

The study shows that while couples with 10 or more years between them nowadays comprise eight per cent of households, that figure was almost double in the 1800s.

And while there is no particular trend for either gender to be the older spouse in the 21st century, in 61 per cent of cases the woman was the older partner two centuries previously.

But while the modern day cougar might prey on younger men for sport, the Victorian lady had little choice in the matter.

In the 1800s high mortality rates, particularly in the workplace, resulted in a greater number of widows, who needed to remarry, often to younger partners, to support families.

The study also revealed a prevalence of single-parent households during Victorian times.

These days around five per cent of households are single parent families, however a look at 1841 Census results, reveals back then one in six - or 16 per cent - of homes had just one parent.

But unlike today, the cause of the breakdown of most relationships was down to the high mortality rate - death from childbirth was far more common than divorce.

Many modern parents might bemoan the fact that they are lumbered with their children living at home for longer - but in fact the 'boomerang generation' where adult children move back in with their parents is far from being a new thing.

Modern cougars: Both Demi Moore and Caroline Flack have been labelled as cougars, but being partnered with a younger man is not a new phenomenon according to a new study

In the 1841 Census, one in seven households had at least one adult-child aged 25 or older living under their roof, while today that figure is lower at 12 per cent - despite present high unemployment driving many adults back into the family home.

One modern development researchers found was the number of non-married, cohabiting couples.

During the 1800s women often got married in their teens or early twenties, while today the average woman is 30-years-old before she ties the knot.

Cohabiting couples comprised around one per cent of households during the 19th century, compared to 10 per cent today.

Miriam Silverman, the website's UK Content Manager, said: 'The millions of census records now online allow for the observation of fascinating social trends - including how today's non-nuclear families are far from a modern trend.

'In many ways, a married couple with 2.4 children is the real 'unconventional' household.

'Census records are the most valuable collections available for anyone looking to begin the enthralling and rewarding journey into their family history - listing the details of millions of people living in England and Wales from 1841 to 1911.'
