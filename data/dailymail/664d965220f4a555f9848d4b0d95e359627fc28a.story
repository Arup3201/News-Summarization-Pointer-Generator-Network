A Utah woman accused of using burning bacon to start a fire in her ex-boyfriend's house entered a guilty plea Tuesday.

Cameo Adawn Crispi acknowledged that she put a pound of meat on a cookie sheet on top of a stove and turned the burner on high March 14.

Police said officers who responded to the house found smoke pouring out the front door and hot coals on the floor around an open wood stove.

Authorities said the 32-year-old woman was arrested after a brief struggle with officers.

Charging documents stated that Crispi's blood-alcohol level was 0.346, more than four times the legal limit for driving in Utah, reported Deseret News. 

Crispi pleaded guilty Tuesday to reduced charges of reckless burning, attempted assault by a prisoner and intoxication.

She was originally charged with arson, burglary and electronic communication harassment, among other counts. 

According to the initial charges, when asked by a doctor following the incident what had happened, Crispi stated she was 'attempting to start a fire in the house to get back at [her ex-boyfriend].'

Crispi's former paramour, who was not home March 14, called police after receiving 15 calls and text messages from the jilted woman in less than an hour.

When interviewed by police, Crispi admitted to placing a pound of bacon on the stovetop.

'I asked to come in and observed a wood stove left open with a fire burning inside and hot coals on the floor around the stove,' the responding officer wrote in his report..

'I observed the burner to be on the setting "High" and the bacon to be severely burned and smoking badly.'

Crispi is scheduled to be sentenced May 19. She could face up to two years and three months behind bars.
