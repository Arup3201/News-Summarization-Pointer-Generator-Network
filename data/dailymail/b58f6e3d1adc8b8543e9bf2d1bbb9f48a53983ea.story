Passengers flying out of Paris will be able to pick up a copy of the latest issue of Charlie Hebdo after Air France purchased 20,000 copies.

Despite newstands across Europe selling out in minutes, the French carrier has moved quickly to show their support for the press title.

With a usual print run of around 60,000 copies, the first issue printed after the terror attacks, where 12 people were killed at the magazine offices, was increased to five million copies.

The issue includes a cartoon of the prophet Mohammed on the front cover, with the words Tout est pardonné, French for 'All is forgiven'.

Mohammed is pictured holding a placard that reads 'Je Suis Charlie,' the phrase that is trending worldwide as a tribute to those killed in Paris. 

The magazine will be distributed in the departure lounges of both Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports.

The Charlie Hebdo weekly print run is usually 60,000, but the latest issue is now at five million 

Despite the horror attack on the magazine headquarters in the French capital, the remaining members of the team have produced this issue filled with the usual provocative content, as well as illustrations by those killed in the shooting.

Issues of the magazine had sold out across Paris news kiosks yesterday morning within minutes. 

A handful of magazines are expected to be available in the UK by the end of the week, but eager British eBay users are bidding three-figure sums for the survivors' edition.

The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo maintained the intentionally offensive tone that made the newspaper famous in France.

The first two pages include drawings by the slain cartoonists: One shows a well-known late French nun talking about oral sex; another shows Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders dividing up the world.

The lead editorial lays out a vigorous defense of secularism, and of the newspaper's right to lampoon religions and hold their leaders accountable - and ends with a critique of the Pope.
