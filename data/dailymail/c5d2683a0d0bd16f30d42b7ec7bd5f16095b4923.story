The so-called 'Fight of the Century' is still over two months away, but preparations have begun for Manny Pacquiao ahead of his much-anticipated battle with Floyd Mayweather.

PacMan, as he is affectionately nicknamed, is at home in the Philippines, and he engaged in some pad work with his trainer at a gym in Manila on Thursday.

Pacquiao, whose professional record reads 57 wins, five losses and two draws in his 64 bouts, will soon head to Los Angeles to step up his training ahead of the fight.

Before he heads across the Atlantic though, Pacquiao will take the time out from boxing to appear in another match for his basketball team Kia Carnival, for whom he is a player-coach.

The 36-year-old took to the field on Wednesday as his side recorded a shock 106-103 win over Philippines basketball heavyweights Talk 'N Text, and he will play his last match before the big fight on Saturday, against Blackwater Elite. 

The bout is worth £160million, making it the most expensive fight of all time, and Pacquiao looked focused as he trained in a white vest.
