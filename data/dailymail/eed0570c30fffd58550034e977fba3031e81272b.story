In the two days after a section of West Bromwich Albion fans booed their team from the field following defeat to Everton, Alan Irvine got out of the midlands.

Not because this 56-year-old Glaswegian couldn't handle the heat, but rather he had Premier League matches to watch.

On the Sunday, he was at Old Trafford as Manchester United’s 'Gaalacticos' illustrated their attacking force while just about hiding their defensive frailties in the 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers.

On the Monday, he travelled to the KC Stadium as Abel Hernandez and Enner Valencia announced themselves to English football in a pulsating 2-2 draw between Hull and West Ham.

In 48 hours, roughly 400 miles covered as Irvine sought to scout future opponents and get a measure of what his team will face this season. Rather than rely on videos or reports, he wants to witness as much football first-hand as possible.

At training, he is first to arrive, typically by 7am, reminiscent of another of Glasgow’s football sons. The sessions are said to be the best many of the players have experienced.

That is not to say any of this is particularly unusual for a Premier League manager – or in Irvine’s case, head coach – but the point is this is a talented man working hard enough to be afforded time in a role not without its difficulties.

In the summer 13 senior players left, with 11 arriving – a change in personnel greater even than Ronald Koeman has had to manage at Southampton. Knitting the team together was made trickier by the number of new recruits who had missed pre-season and were not yet fit enough to play.

Irvine's work ethic, including being first at the training ground every day, is comparable to Sir Alex Ferguson's

Britt Assombalonga has the opportunity to test his talents against Premier League defenders with Tottenham as Capital One Cup opposition for Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night. 

he hulking striker has scored eight goals in the Championship already, after being bought for £5.5million from Peterborough. 

That looked steep, but if he nets at White Hart Lane then the perspective really does flip. The 21-year-old has the potential to play higher. 

The results were uninspiring – draws with Sunderland and Southampton (although that 0-0 at St Mary’s now looks better in context) and defeats to Swansea and Everton. Heading into their match at Tottenham, West Brom were as long as 7/1 to win. Bottom place in the table beckoned.

That they deservedly came away with three points is a credit to Irvine’s training sessions and tactics as much as a signal of further Spurs malaise. That victory was huge. With it, West Brom’s position and Irvine’s credibility took a leap.

There was anger from fans when Irvine was announced as next in line after Pepe Mel. Scarred from a season of three managers and flirtation with relegation, they craved a sign that this campaign would be different.

Understandably, a bigger name was desired. Better still, someone with Premier League experience. Heck, just an individual who had not been sacked at his last two jobs would do.

Irvine replaced Pepe Mel, who left The Hawthorns at the end of last season

Irvine was also in charge at Sheffield Wednesday in 2010 & 2011, but couldn't stop them dropping to League 1

What do Leicester’s Esteban Cambiasso and Aston Villa’s Tom Cleverley have in common?

Before any jokes about their respective abilities as midfielders, you should know each sidestepped agents to call their current clubs direct and get their transfers sorted. 

Occasionally middlemen only end up creating a muddle. 

But Irvine it was, selected by chairman Jeremy Peace under recommendation from technical director Terry Burton. They looked into the details of Irvine’s chastening experiences at Preston and Sheffield Wednesday and found on each occasion the cord was cut at a very early period of downturn.

They listened to figures within the game, who told of Irvine’s ability to improve players on the training fields and create relationships with those under his instruction.

Joleon Lescott admires Irvine from their time together at Everton and joined soon after the Scot was unveiled. (He reminded what a good defender he is in that shut-out at White Hart Lane, his first game for six months.)

Importantly, Irvine works within West Brom’s continental structure. Tim Sherwood, who priced himself out of the job, wanted two assistants.

Clearly one win over Spurs does not dispel all the doubt about Irvine, especially in the eyes of fans, but it means Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup tie against Hull will be played in an upbeat atmosphere.

Burnley visit the Hawthorns on Sunday in a match West Brom will want three points from, although with only four goals scored by these teams combined it promises to be a tight encounter.

Irvine is likely to stand at the edge of the technical area in club tracksuit once more before changing into suit and tie for media duties. Firm handshakes will greet those searching for such.

Then there will be trips across the land, as Irvine endeavours to make this third opportunity at management last longer than his others. He deserves that chance.
