Ruthless metal thieves left animals for dead after raiding an animal hospital and stealing their cages to sell for scrap.

The heartless thieves took 26 stainless steel and aluminum cages, worth up to £30,000, after turfing the sick animals out of them.

Two blackbirds and six hedgehogs died after the raiders broke into the Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital in Kibworth.

And some of the injured birds being treated, including wood pigeons, collared doves and blackbirds, escaped through the front door which was left wedged open by thieves.

Others, including an injured swan, were left wandering around the building.

Staff at the animal hospital said they were confronted with a scene of devastation and destruction after turning up for work last Friday.

Volunteer Julia Simonson said the thieves had ransacked all six rooms at the hospital and left the site in disarray.

Julia said: 'I saw sick animals either dead or dying on the floor. The people who did this ripped the cages off the walls and threw the animals out.

'It was heartbreaking to see all the animals I and other volunteers care for and nurture just lying there cowering or wandering about distressed.

'What kind of people can do this to a collection of sick animals? They must be sick themselves.

'Usually, when I arrive at the hospital the animals recognise my car and my voice and all clamour to be fed. When I arrived last Friday it was eerily quiet.'

Hospital founder Angela Downham said it looked like the thieves had used a van to rip the front gate off its posts to gain access to the site.

Angela, 46, said: 'The alarm system tells us that they got in through a window and attacked the main system at 10.02pm on Thursday.

'They forced the front door and wedged it open, which is how lots of our sick animals have wandered out or flown off.'

The 46-year-old founded the charity 24 years ago and opened the hospital 18 months ago after raising £500,000.

She said: 'We had only half-built the hospital as we had run out of money. It is shame as the full site would include a flat, which would provide a 24-hour security presence.

'This is very distressing and a real setback for us, but it will not stop us. We will have to close the place to new admissions and just look after the animals we have.'

A police spokesman said: 'We are aware of the incident and appeal to anyone who has information to give us a call.'
