William Hague promised to stand by Gibraltar last night as he urged Spain to avoid further actions which could ramp up tensions.

After talks with Gibraltar’s leader Fabian Picardo, the Foreign Secretary said: ‘The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Gibraltar at this time of increasing Spanish pressure and rhetoric.

‘We will respect Gibraltar’s 2006 constitution and the commitments the UK has repeatedly made not to compromise on British sovereignty over Gibraltar.’

And he added: ‘I call upon Spain to respect the agreements over the Rock and to avoid actions which could increase tension further.’

Mr Picardo claimed ‘hell will freeze over’ before Gibraltarian authorities remove an artificial reef Spain believes is harming its fisherman and which has been at the centre of escalating tensions.

Accusing Madrid of ‘sabre-rattling’, he said: ‘The things that have been said are more reminiscent of the type of statement you’d hear from North Korea than from an EU partner.

‘We’ve seen it before during Franco’s time but I think all of us hoped that those politics were never going to come back.’

Spanish officials have continued to delay vehicles at the border, with moped and motorbike riders facing queues of two hours in 90-degree heat to cross over from Gibraltar.

Spain claims sovereignty over the Rock, which has been a British Overseas Territory since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

Last week Spanish foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo threatened to levy tolls on border crossings and shut Spanish airspace to flights bound for Gibraltar.

But the UK Government has made it clear that there will be no negotiation over sovereignty as long as Gibraltar’s people want to remain British.

David Cameron has now flown home from his holiday and will take charge of the crisis. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘Clearly, we remain seriously concerned by the events at the Spain-Gibraltar border.

‘The Spanish have not raised the prospect of introducing border fees with us. We are seeking an explanation from them regarding reports that they might target Gibraltar with further measures.’

Senior MPs and government officials have accused Madrid of ramping up the dispute to divert attention from the dire state of the Spanish economy.

Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said: ‘The Spanish are in deep trouble. Their economy is in grave difficulties. They raise the issue of Gibraltar to generate domestic support.

‘Frankly, it’s shameful for a country like Spain, who is meant to be an ally to the United Kingdom, to treat Gibraltar in this way. It’s time they grew up and behaved like a democracy instead of bullying a small territory which has been British longer than it was Spanish.’

Lib Dem Sir Menzies Campbell warned that Spain’s tactics were unlikely to succeed.

‘It’s a gross miscalculation to believe that the people of Gibraltar, or the British Government, are likely to succumb to pressure of the kind that’s being proposed,’ he said.

‘If anything, it will simply stiffen resolve both in Whitehall and Gibraltar.’ And UKIP’s MEP for Gibraltar, William Dartmouth, even suggested that Britain send a gunboat to the Rock.

He said: ‘It is time the British Government pulled its finger out and stopped mouthing diplomatic niceties to Madrid.

‘The British Government must show some backbone to support the people of Gibraltar.

‘By sending a frigate to Gib, the message will ring out loud and clear: Gibraltar is British.’

The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain.

Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty.

Despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory.

The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltar from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession.

The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713.

Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy.

Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping.

Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own 
affairs, although defence and foreign relations are still the 
responsibility of the UK Government.

Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres.
