A semi-retired Hollywood cameraman says he invented the celebrity selfie, and has been taking shots of himself with the rich and famous for more than two decades.

Lester Wisbrod, 67, recently claimed ownership of the trend in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, showing off his more than 150 photographs with the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Ronald Reagan and Mike Tyson that he calls 'silly shots'

'Everybody's making a big fuss about 
selfies — selfie this, selfie that … give me a break. I've been doing 
selfies since 1981,' he told the LA Times. 'I thought I better do something or else 
I'll end up as roadkill on the history highway.'

That's my idea! Semi-retired Hollywood cameraman Lester Wisbrod is taking credit for inventing the celebrity selfie

Wisbrod says his selfie days started when he entered the TV business in 1968, getting paid $2 dollars an hour working to film 'Romper Room' in Las Vegas.

That job led to several others in the area and eventually he moved to Los Angeles for more work in 1979.

It was in Hollywood that he started working on shows like 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' and 'A Current Affair' where he began to rub shoulders with the movers and shakers in the entertainment industry.

Successful: Wisbrod was only ever denied a picture once, by M*A*S*H actress Loretta Swit. Pictured above with actress Jennifer Aniston

His first selfie was taken in 1981 with humorist Art Buchwald and shot on a traditional film camera.

Wisbrod went on to take about 150 selfies with celebrities, and credits his success with first chatting up the stars he was introduced to on set.

He says he was only turned down once, by M*A*S*H actress Loretta Swit, who would only agree to the picture if someone else took the shot.

'I awkwardly withdrew,' Wisbrod recalls.

Since selfies require the the subject and cameraman to join close, Wisbrod says the resulting photographs are more intimate and put the celebrities 'in a whole different mood'.

In many of the shots, the celebrities wrap their arms around Wisbrod as if he's a close friend.

And the shots have made for quite a few good stories.

When he approached Steven Spielberg for a snap, the famous director cautioned him about his angle.

'Are you sure you want to take it that way?' Speilberg asked. 'You may not get another chance.'

But the picture came out fine, just like his shot with President Ronald Reagan, once he was out of office. That shot was more difficult to take since Wisbrod had to make his way past Secret Service.

There are also some awkward memories, like the time he approached Bill Pullman who thought he was 'macking' on his girlfriend, something Wisbrod denies. 

Wisbrod  explained why he continued to document his run-ins with the rich and famous, saying it was a way to document his life after leaving his hometown.

'I came from East Oakland,' he said. 'People in East Oakland really don't get out and about into the 
celebrity scene much. I did it so much I really kind of took it for 
granted. In a way, I kind of miss it now.'
