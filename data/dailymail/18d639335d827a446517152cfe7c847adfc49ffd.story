He also appeared in American Hustle as a customer in a restaurant.

According to the Boston Globe, during high school, he impregnated Lorrie Higgins, now 41, the long-time girlfriend of Boston mayor Martin J. Walsh. She gave birth to Lauren, now 21, but Campbell did not remain a part of her life.

In the piece he is described as a 'a dark-haired rowdy who gradually built up a rap sheet of low-level crimes.' 

Jessica Broderick, a high school classmate of Higgins, told the Globe during an interview in March last year: 'He was kind of the bad boy and she was the good girl. He was the boy she shouldn’t be hanging out with.' 

In a statement to the paper, Mayor Walsh said the deaths were personal and asked that Higgins’ and her daughter’s privacy be respected. 

Career: Campbell, who allegedly tried to lunge at police with a knife before he was shot, has also made appearances in Ted and American Hustle

He has previously served nine months behind bars and moved back in with his mother when her husband died 12 years ago.

At the scene both officers decided simultaneously that deadly force was necessary and opened fire on Campbell, who was brought to South Shore Hospital and pronounced dead, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.

Mrs Campbell was pronounced dead at the scene. Officials said there was evidence that Patricia Campbell was stabbed. The medical examiner's office was to perform an autopsy.

Police and the prosecutor's office said the investigation was continuing.

Probe: Both of the officers involved in the shooting, who are said to have been on the force for around 10 years, have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation

'There is no such thing as a routine call,' Weymouth Police Chief Richard Grimes said Monday. 'Situations like this illustrate that.'

The names of the two officers haven't been released. Officials said both were evaluated at a hospital and placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, under normal post-shooting protocols. Officials said both officers have been on the force for about 10 years.

The district attorney's office said Weymouth police reported that they had responded to the Campbells' home three times in recent years, all for medical calls.

Family ties: When he was in high school, Campbell got Lorrie Higgins - the long-time girlfriend of Boston Mayor Martin Walsh - pregnant. Their daughter Lauren is now 21
