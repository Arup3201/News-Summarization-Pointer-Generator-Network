Adrian insists there was never any doubt he would finish off the last penalty to down Everton and carry West Ham through their epic third-round FA Cup tie.

The West Ham goalkeeper had already saved Steven Naismith's penalty only for Stewart Downing to miss their last, which would've won them the game but instead sent the shootout into sudden death.

But after another four penalties had been scored by both, Adrian saved fellow goalkeeper Joel Robles's effort, then threw his gloves to the floor before running up and slotting in to win 9-8 after two sets of 90 minutes and extra time could not separate the sides.

Adrian arrived at West Ham on a free transfer, but how does he compare to the Premier League's other bargain keepers?

Afterwards Adrian declared: 'In that moment I felt so quiet and relaxed and I didn't have nerves. I thought: "I'll take off my gloves, this game is over and I struck the ball".

'I never took a penalty before – only in training for a joke, but not serious. Never in my life had I struck a penalty in an important game.

'I think this is my best moment for West Ham. I feel really, really happy for keeping us in the FA Cup. My team-mates kept working in the game.

'It was a crazy game for us, because they scored two goals with 10 men and it was really hard for us. We kept going and going and after that they shot their penalties so well.

'I took my gloves off so quickly because I was worried that the referee might blow his whistle and give me a yellow card for time-wasting!'

Since they lifted the FA Cup in 1995, 14 teams have won one of the three major domestic competitions...

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce hailed his match-winning goalkeeper as one of the best in the Premier League.

Adrian revealed that was the first goal he has ever scored in his professional career, after originally playing as an forward before moving between the sticks as a youngster.

He added: 'I have celebrated my saves before normally, but never scoring a goal.

'Since I came to West Ham United, the fans have had a special relationship with me and I feel so happy. It's the first time I've scored an important goal so I celebrated with them and my team-mates.

'It's a big win because we now have so much confidence. The team played well and worked so well. The game was long but we needed to keep going and finally we got a nice win.'

Now Adrian is hoping for a call-up from Spain manager Vicente Del Bosque after a series of stellar displays for West Ham, although Real Madrid’s Iker Casillas and Manchester United’s David de Gea stand in his way.

But Adrian, who manager Sam Allardyce hailed as one of the best keepers in the Premier League after his display against Everton, insists he is ready if the chance arises.

‘I feel completely prepared,’ Adrian said. ‘But I wait for the call. That is the decision of the national team boss.

‘I have had another good game for West Ham but the only thing that makes it special is that I scored the last penalty to get the win. I have been playing well anyway.

‘People in Spain are talking about me playing for the national team but all I can do is keep doing my job for West Ham.’
