The father of a 4-year-old boy who accidentally shot and killed his 6-year-old friend while the two were playing was indicted on Thursday by a grand jury on six counts of child endangerment.

Anthony Senatore, 33, from Toms River, New Jersey, was arrested in April after his son allegedly shot Brandon Holt, 6, in the head with a .22 calibre rifle.

He was charged with endangering the welfare of a minor. Thursday’s indictment by an Ocean Country jury brought no new charges, according to The Star Ledger.

Dead: Brandon Holt, 6, was shot in the head in April by his friend who was 4 years old

Sad loss: Brandon and his father, Ron Holt on the beach. The boy was shot accidentally

Accident: Brandon and his 4-year-old friend (not pictured) were playing 'pretend shooting' when the horrific incident happened

Senatore faces five counts of second-degree child endangerment, one count of third-degree child endangerment and a disorderly persons’ offense.

The tragic accident happened on April 8 in a quiet residential area of the Ocean County community in New Jersey at a home near the edge of a cul-de-sac.

Brandon and Senatore’s son were playing ‘pretend shooting’ when Senatore’s little boy ran into his parents’ bedroom and emerged moments later with the rifle. 

He went outside where Brandon was sitting in a golf cart.

The rifle, authorities said, fired. Brandon was shot in the head.

Brandon died the next evening at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune.

Fought for his life: The young boy was rushed to hospital but died the next day

Killed: Brandon was shot by Anthony Senatore's .22 calibre rifle, one of five shot guns in Senatore's home

Gone: The Holts say they are glad the case is moving forward but that it will never bring back their son

The family donated Brandon's organs in the hope that something good could come from the tragedy.Brandon’s father, Ron Holt, said at the time: 'We both decided that it would help carry his name, that he's helping somebody.'

The charges allege that in addition to the loaded .22 caliber rifle used to fire the fatal shot, a Stevens 12-gauge shotgun, two Harrington & Richardson shotguns and a Remington 12-gauge shotgun were all found unsecured, in close proximity to ammunition and accessible to Senatore’s children, ages 12, 8 and 4.

Under New Jersey law, residents do not need to register rifles, but they do need a gun purchaser’s identification card to buy them.

It is considered a disorderly persons’ offense if someone fails to secure the weapon or install a trigger lock if a child younger than 16 can gain access to loaded firearms in the home.

Illegal: It is an offense to not secure weapons in a home where children younger than 16 can gain access to the loaded firearms

Devastated: Brandon's parents, Ronald and Christine Holt lost their little six-year-old boy. They donated his organs after he died

Anthony Senatore Sr., the boy’s grandfather, offered his condolences to the Holt family, according to the The Star-Ledger earlier this year.

‘My heart - I can’t even express it in words.’

Kevin L. Parsons, an attorney representing the Holts, said the family is happy the case is moving forward, ‘but it doesn’t really heal anything, it doesn’t change anything’.
