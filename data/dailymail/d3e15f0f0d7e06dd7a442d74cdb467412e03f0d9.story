Talk about 'high jinks.'

Colorado's Department of Transportation released a series of new advertisements warning against the dangers of driving under the influence of marijuana.

The ads use the slogan 'Drive High, Get a DUI' -- but show that other activities are allowed to be completed under the influence of marijuana in the state, to humorous effect.

In one, a man holds a slab of meat as he repeatedly touches buttons on a grill. His friends look on perplexed and annoyed at his behavior.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

This anti drug-driving advert by Colorado's Department of Transportation shows a man high on marijuana trying to use a barbecue not realising he hasn't got a gas tank attached

The advert comes with the message:  'Grilling high is now legal. Driving to get the propane you forgot isn't' then shows the space where the gas cylinder should be

The advert then cheekily displays the words, 'Grilling high is now legal. Driving to get the propane you forgot isn't.' It shows the empty space where the propane gas would be.

Another advertisement shows a man who grins and makes karate gestures while high as he installs a television.

As he is lured away to a plate of snacks, the advert displays the slogan, 'Installing your TV while high is now legal.'

When the mounted television falls and crashes to the floor, words appear saying 'Driving to get a new one isn't'

A third advertisement shows a man dribbling a basketball and ready to shoot as other players on the court wait expectantly.

They appear to look annoyed and confused as the man keeps dribbling -- and never shoots.

'Playing ball high is now legal,' the advert reads. 'Driving to see the pros play afterward isn't.'

Colorado state troopers, in order to be considered 'drug recognition experts,' must undergo nine days of training so they know how to spot drivers under the influence of marijuana, CBS News reports.

Unlike alcohol, marijuana can't be tested for with a breathalyzer test, the website adds. A limit of 5 nanograms of THC in your blood can only be determined with a blood test.

Marijuana was cited as a factor in 15 percent of impaired driving citations last year, according to CBS News.
