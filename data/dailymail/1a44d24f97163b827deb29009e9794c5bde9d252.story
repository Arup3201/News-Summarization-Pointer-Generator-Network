In its heyday it hosted the elite and influential including royalty and Hollywood's A-list celebrities - but that all ended with the Rainbow Room's closure following the 2008 financial collapse.

Now one of New York's best-known and much-loved high-society haunts is set to reopen in 2014, after nearly five years collecting dust.

Commanding some of the city's best views, the restaurant, cabaret room and bar, on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, central Manhattan, will once again open its doors to the rich and famous.

When it reopens in autumn of next year, it will be exactly 80 years after the venue's inaugural unveiling as a swanky supper club after the repeal of Prohibition, in 1934.

In the early part of the century, the sky-high venue was legendary for hosting big bands on a revolving floor, in a magnificent room where guests could dine and dance the night away.

The swinging 1960s saw the lofty restaurant used as a party haunt for many Hollywood greats, including the cast of the film 'Funny Girl' in 1968, which included singer Barbra Streisand and her husband Elliot Gould.

The venue was frequently used in the 1990s to host award ceremonies, particularly for films, and was frequented by world famous stars from across the world.

In the 1980s, facing competition from other exclusive restaurants, including the Equitable Center and Battery Park City, the venue was closed for nearly two years from 1985 and underwent a $25million restoration and expansion to its 45,000 square feet.

A little more than a decade later, in 1998, the Rockefeller family passed operations of the restaurant over to the Italian Cipriani family, the founders of the renowned Harry's Bar in Venice.

The European extensively remodelled the place and fired all union workers. Things were booming again up until the 2008 financial crash; the price of a New Year;s Eve ticket in 2007 was $160,000 per person, which included Champagne, caviar, truffles, cocktails and access to the venue throughout the night and for breakfast the next day.

In October 2008, the city granted it landmark status saying its art deco-style decor 'came to epitomize New York City'.

Then a few months later, in 2009, the iconic nightclub at Rockefeller Center closed amid a landlord-tenant dispute.

Tishman Speyer, which operates Rockefeller Center, made the reopening announcement yesterday, noting that restaurant development company Blau + Associates will oversee the process.
