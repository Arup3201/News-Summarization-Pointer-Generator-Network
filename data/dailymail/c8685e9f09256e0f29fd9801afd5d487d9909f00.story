An Indiana mother whose daughter took her own life when she was just 14 years old is  fighting to push through a new piece of legislation that would make schools play a bigger role when it comes to bullying.

Angel Green was in eighth grade when her mother found her hanged from a tree, leaving behind a suicide note after enduring years of bullying that started with her weight, hair and appearance and took a far darker turn at the end, with students mocking the girl for the years of sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her father.

She said in her note; 'It's bullying that killed me. Please get justice.'

Words her mother, Danielle Green, still lives by as she continues her fight to make sure schools do everything in their power to monitor harassment and bullying.

Danielle Green (above) has now made a point to do evertything she can to curb bullying in schools

Green has made this her priority every day since March 5, 2013, when she looked over from a bus stop and realized after a few seconds that the young girl hanging from the tree with a rope around her neck was her daughter.

Since then, she drafted a new anti-bullying law that received 150,000 signatures and provided a few major changes in how the state of Indiana would try to curb harassment, with the biggest change being that schools would start being held accountable.

Like most young people, girls in particular, Angel was bullied about the same things as most other kids her age starting in about sixth grade, be it her weight or her freckles or her hair.

Then, when Angel entered eighth grade, students began mocking her when her father was arrested after years of sexually abusing and molesting her.

He plead guilty and is serving out an 18-year sentence.

This is why holding schools accountable for harassment is so important to Green, who believes that bullying is what pushed her daughter to suicide.

The Tippecanoe School District told NBC News that 'administrators are confident the school made all social and emotional resources, internal and external, available to this child and family.'

'It's bullying that killed me. Please get justice,' wrote Angel in her suicide note

Angel ended her life, her body seen before she had been identified from a bus stop by her mother, hanged from a tree

After the bill found a sponsor and was set to go, Green thought her mission was over, until she got the news that she said 'hit us like a ton of bricks.' 

There were 307 pages of proposed changes, and one of those changes, which even Green was unaware of, was the removal of the section that made schools accountable for harassment. 

Dear Mom,

I'm really sorry that I did this. Don't you EVER think it was your fault. Because it's not. I love you so much and I couldn't ask for a better mum. Thank you for caring and feeding and loving me for 14 years.

I'm sorry once again. But my heart can't take this pain.

I'm gonna miss you so much. I love you. And I can't wait till the day I get to see you again. I'll be waiting at heaven's gates for you. I love you.

Goodbye :(

Angelina Green

P.s. It's bullying that killed me. Please get justice. 

Now Green has started a new petition on Change.org to get the bill stopped until this is put back in and schools are legally required to take an active role, which, despite the extra work, will help curb bullying and suicides.

'My beautiful daughter Angel took her own life after being repeatedly bullied by classmates both in person on school grounds and over the internet,' writes Green on her page.

'The pain of losing a child is indescribable -- she was the light of my life and I still can’t comprehend life without her.'

On the other side however is Seamus Boyce, the attorney for the firm who advised undoing those measures, and, as he explains it, this law is already in existence.

Bullying, he says, is covered by federal anti-discrimination laws.

He also reports  the inexact science of aspects of the bill, such as asking schools to report incidents of bullying, and pointing out that 'some said they had none and some said they had like 400.'

As for Green, despite her new fight and the setbacks presented by this unforeseen change, there is one bright side, and that comes with the outpouring of love and support she received when she set up her Change.org page. 

'I sat down a little bit ago and started reading some of the comments,' she revealed last week. 

'And I just sat here and cried.'
