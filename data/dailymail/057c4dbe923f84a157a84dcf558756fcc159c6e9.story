Councils in England paid more than £200,000 to teachers after they were attacked by their pupils

Teachers who have been attacked by their own pupils were handed more than £200,000 in payouts last year.

There were 17 incidents in 2013, which involved punching, biting and headbutting, and led to councils across the country paying teachers compensation. 

The Sun on Sunday revealed a Dorset teacher received £43,000 after suffering injuries inflicted by a student.

One female teacher was handed £3,000 after a pupil bit her on the head in Croydon, south London.

Another teacher received £3,500 after being hit by glass that was thrown by a student.  

The figures come after 16-year-old Will Cornick was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years last week after stabbing to death 61-year-old Mrs Maguire at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April.  

Christopher McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, told the Sun on Sunday: 'Schools should be places of learning, not battlefields.'

The NASUWT teachers' union, which records reports of attacks, says: 'Staff are entitled to work in an environment free from violence and disruption and to appropriate access to training and support on behaviour matters.'

'Pupils are entitled to a safe and orderly learning environment, together with effective teaching and support, to assist them in achieving their full potential.'

Numbers of students suspended for attacks in school have been rising for the past few years. 

Earlier this year, a 14-year-old boy attacked seven teachers in school in a terrifying rampage after he was told off for chewing gum.

The pupil headbutted one teacher up to 15 times, body-barged another and kicked out and punched others as they tried to calm him down, a court has heard.

He also picked up a chair and attempted to throw it across the classroom, emptied cupboards and upturned drawers from a desk.

The pupil, who has been allowed to stay at the school, also kicked a glass panel in the foyer.

Staff at the school in Oldham, Greater Manchester, including the headmistress, attempted to restrain the boy but he began to kick out and threaten them.

The teachers - six of whom were women - were able to remove his shoes before he could cause serious injury and police were called to the school to arrest him.  

Last year, a teacher whose arm was knocked into a filing cabinet by a pupil received almost £400,000 in compensation.

The secondary school worker was putting a confiscated football into the cabinet when the child smashed his arm in the drawer.

The victim was unable to continue working after developing ‘complex regional pain syndrome’ – described by the NHS as a ‘burning pain’ - and was handed £382,930 in compensation.
