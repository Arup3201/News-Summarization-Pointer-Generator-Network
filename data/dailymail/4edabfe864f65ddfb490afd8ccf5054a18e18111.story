Not everyone was getting in the holy spirit when millions of Hindus gathered to wash away their sins.

This youngster looked anything but pleased to be taking part in the impressive religious ritual at the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythic Saraswatis river in India.

The 55-day festival attracts an estimated 100 million pilgrims to the area, known as Sangam, and happens just once every 12 years.

The Maha Kumbh Mela is one of Hinduism's holiest celebrations and is thought to be the largest religious gathering in the world.

It celebrates the victory of gods over demons in a battle for nectar that would grant them immortality.

As one of the gods fled with a pitcher of the nectar, a drop spilled at the holy site, near the town of Allahabad, northern India, worshipers believe.

Participants at the Kumbh believe a bath in the river on one of the festival's auspicious bathing days can rid them of their sins.

The river becomes a mass of bodies 
during the celebrations, with men and their sons stripping to their 
underwear to wade in the water alongside veiled women.

Many dunk their heads under the water, while others drink it and even bottle it to taking it home as gifts.

Among the worshipers are ash smeared ascetics wearing marigold garlands and nothing else.

The
numbers attending are so great, a temporary city of campsites emerges 
on the banks of the waterway and covers and area larger than the Greek 
capital of Athens.

Malti Devi, 65, from London, who was 
taking part in the celebrations for the first time, told Sky News: 'One 
dip in the river has the power to change life forever.'

But this year's festival was marred earlier this month with a deadly stampede as pilgrims made their way to the holy waters.

An overcrowded footbridge buckled a a railway station lose to the site, killing 36 people.

Concerns have also been expressed not only about hygiene in the vast campsite, but also the levels of pollution in the Ganges.
