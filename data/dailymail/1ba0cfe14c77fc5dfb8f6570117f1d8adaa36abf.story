Kate Silverton has warned against the growing trend of women who are starting to have children until they are in their forties after pursuing their careers. 

The BBC newsreader gave birth to her second child in June this year at the age of 43 and has a three-year-old daughter.

However she said she is aware of the pressure for today's women to 'have it all' - many faced with the choice between pursuing their career in their 30s or putting it on hold to start a family.

Kate Silverton, pictured with her daughter Clemency, is concerned women are feeling the pressure to pursue their careers and delay having a family, but said this can leave many struggling to conceive in their 40s

She told the Evening Standard: 'A lot of women I know are having huge difficulty trying to conceive and many are losing out by virtue of the fact that they can't see beyond their career, yet when they do come to a point where they are ready to start a family it is potentially too late.' 

Silverton, who got married in 2011, did not think she would be able to have children. 

After an operation to remove an ovary in 2009 after a cyst burst she had four rounds of IVF which did not work. 

She then conceived naturally.

The newsreader has gone freelance since having a family and says she is fully enjoying spending time with her children. 

She also said she takes them into work when she needs to, and admitted she has probably created havoc.

She also refuses to accept that being a mother means she cannot do anything else. 

The newsreader, who is a keen supporter of African charity the Tusk Trust, recently appeared with her daughter Clemency to give a speech at the Royal Geographical Society.

Silverton said she felt lucky to have been able to pursue a successful career in her thirties, become financially stable and then have a family, but was aware that for a lot of women this would not be possible.

Silverton said she felt lucky to have had two children in her after pursuing a career at the BBC 

'I know not everyone has that luxury — in the future we might look back on that and think it was terribly sad, I'm not sure we got it right,' she added. 

Miss Silverton gave birth to her second child, Wilbur Silverton Heron in June. She named her son after author Wilbur Smith who wrote about Africa and inspired her love for the country. 

She said after her daughter Clemency was born she was told she had just a two per cent chance of getting pregnant and her and her husband were incredibly surprised to have a second child. 

The 44-year-old said she believes it is important to have a debate about whether it is best to delay having children or start a family early and acknowledges that is rarely possible to 'have it all. '

Silverton said she would like to explore how families can be helped financially so they can have children earlier rather than feeling the pressure to save before they can have children.

She suggests ideas of mortgage holidays for parents to make starting a family easier.
