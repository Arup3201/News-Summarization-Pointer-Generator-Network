The suspicious item found near a mosque was a small home-made explosive device, police have confirmed.

Almost 40 homes close to the place of worship on Rutter Street in Walsall, West Midlands, were evacuated after bomb disposal experts were called to the scene.

West Midlands Police said they are treating the incident as a hate crime which resulted in around 150 people having to leave their homes as a ‘precautionary and temporary’ measure.

Probe: Forensic search Rutter Street in Walsall after the discovery of the bomb there last month

Suspicious item: Police were called to Rutter Street (pictured today) in Walsall, West Midlands, last night following the discovery in the building's grounds. The item was then brought inside by a member of the public

A loud
 bang heard by residents in the Caldmore area of Walsall late on Friday 'appeared to be consistent' with the device exploding,

The item had been found on Friday and taken inside the mosque by a well-meaning member of the public, police added.

Superintendent Keith Fraser, head of 
crime and operations for Walsall Police, said the incident was being 
treated as hate crime but the motive for placing the item near a mosque 
remained unclear.

Speaking at the scene, he said: ‘At 
around 10.15pm on Saturday, police were called to Aisha mosque in 
relation to a suspicious item that had been found. The force are taking 
this extremely seriously.

‘We have launched a full investigation
 into the suspicious item. What's going to be 
the key to this is the public's help in relation to helping us to 
understand why that suspicious item was in the area.’

Response: Police, other emergency services and army bomb disposal experts were in the area this morning

He added: ‘Officers are continuing to 
work hard to establish what the item is and how it got there but the 
incident is being treated as a hate crime, although the motive for 
placing the item near to the mosque remains unclear.’

Supt Fraser confirmed that the suspicious item is now safe and is being examined by trained experts.

Police said officers have increased 
patrols in the area and around all places of worship, although the 
incident is believed to be isolated.

A 40-metre section of Rutter Street, 
in the Caldmore area of Walsall, remained cordoned off earlier and two 
uniformed Army personnel were at the scene.

Police were also still outside the 
Aisha Mosque and Islamic Centre, including one officer wearing a blue 
full-length forensic suit, who could be seen taking photographs of areas
 of interest nearby.

Ali Mahmood, the chair of the local 
traders' association, said local people had been given no details of the
 nature of the suspicious item. ‘It's a very big shock for the local community,’ he said. ‘To see the road cordoned off like this is shocking.’

About 80 people evacuated overnight 
were given shelter by Walsall Council, while 70 residents made 
arrangements with friends or family.

Viyja Kainth, the vice-chairman of 
Palfrey and Caldmore Neighbourhood Watch and residents' group, praised 
the council for helping to provide accommodation to those forced to 
leave their homes.

Mr Kainth, who also thanked members of
 the St John Ambulance for their help, said: ‘We were told by the police
 that there was an incident of a serious nature. The residents were evacuated in the early hours of the morning when the council put in place its procedures.

‘The council did a good job in getting their resources and staff together to provide that service.’
