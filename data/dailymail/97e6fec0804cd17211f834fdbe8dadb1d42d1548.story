A brutally disfigured body discovered in a dumpster is seven-year-old Jorelys Rivera who went missing at her family's apartment complex, investigators said today.

The body was badly beaten and showed signs of sexual assault, according to police. Autopsy results are yet to fully confirm the
cause of death.

Georgia Bureau of Investigation director Vernon Keenan said: 'This is going to be a very, very horrendous crime. I am convinced of that after having observed the body.

'A child who dies under extreme violence is the absolutely the worst thing that can happen to a human being.'

He added that authorities 'do not have a strong suspect'.

The body was discovered around 12.30 pm today.

Police
and volunteers spent the weekend combing the area around the apartment 
complex playground where Jorelys Rivera was last seen.

At
the time of her disappearance, the child was being looked after by a 
teenage babysitter along with her two siblings in Canton, Georgia.

At around 5pm on Friday, she left the park to go and collect drinks from home for her friends. She disappeared between the playground and her home at the River Ridge Apartments.

Police had sent several Coca-Cola cans found nearby 
for forensic testing to see if these are the drinks that the child had gone to 
collect for her friends. 

A creek in the neighbourhood was dredged late last night but nothing was found.

Distraught: Jorelys' mother Joselin had appealed for her daughter's safe return

Jorelys' mother Joselin Rivera had 
made an emotional plea for her return and her father, who lives in 
Florida, had flown to the city in Cherokee County. 

A friend translated for Spanish-speaking Mrs Rivera to local TV station 11alive.com.

She said her daughter was 'friendly, sweet, had lots of friends and everyone just loved her'.

The mother was not considered a suspect, according to police sources but her two other children were taken into protective custody as a precaution.

The Georgia Child Abduction Response Team joined the hunt this morning while volunteers carried out door-to-door searches.

The family van was examined yesterday and bags of evidence removed from the family's apartment. Volunteers also looked through dumpsters with trained search dogs

The police were also working with the school that the seven-year-old attended to put together a list of people that Jorelys knows.
