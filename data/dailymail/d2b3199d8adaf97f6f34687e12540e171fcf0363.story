A former Colorado school board member who was arrested last month for sexting a young boy has been arrested again for carrying on a sexual relationship with another teen.

Authorities reportedly learned of a 2008 sexual affair between Stefanie Dickinson, 37, and the victim, who said he used to babysit her kids.

The arrests have stunned parents at the school district where she serves 
as school board treasurer in the Ellicott District in 
Colorado Springs.

An affidavit obtained by TheDenverChannel.com said the victim told deputies that he had sexual contact with Dickinson at least five times when he was 17 years old.

Charges: An affidavit said the male victim told deputies he had sexual contact with Dickinson five times when he was 17

Now 20, the victim also reportedly told authorities that the two would have sex in her children’s ‘clubhouse’ and in her car.

The victim also accused Ms Dickinson of sending him sexually charged texts and photos.

The married mother of two was charged with sexual assault of a minor.

Mrs Dickinson was arrested last month after she allegedly 'sexted' one of her teenage son's friends.

She allegedly sent the sexually explicit messages to the 14-year-old boy after he joined her family on a weekend camping trip.

She is alleged to have offered to have sex with the teen telling him in one text: 'Baby, I will rock your f****** world!'

Police
said Dickinson asked for the teen's cell number so she could send him 
photographs from their weekend trip to Lake Meredith.

The boy had joined her two teenage sons and her husband on the trip.

The teen said a week later at the end of August  he started receiving text messages of a sexual nature.

An arrest warrant revealed that she sent the boy a message saying she wanted to sneak out of the house to meet him.

A deputy later found a text message on the boy’s phone from Dickinson that read 'I just want u,' the warrant said.

Another text message sent from Dickinson talked about having sex, followed by 'Baby I will rock ur effing world!! Haha.'

The text messages were discovered by 
the boy’s sister, who became suspicious about the relationship after she
saw Dickinson talking to her brother and repeatedly hugging him .

The arrest report said Dickinson would hug the boy after football practice and was heard telling him:'I'll text you later.'

Another
text revealed that Dickinson was concerned about the consequences of 
getting caught when she said to the teen 'You can't tell anyone about 
this at all because I could lose my family.'

The sexting supposedly began after the boy joined Dickinson's family, including her two sons, on a camping trip to Lake Meredith, in Colorado

The victim also told deputies that Dickinson 'would always tell me I have a sexy smile.'

School chiefs issued a statement to parents after Dickinson's arrest.

The statement said:'The District is aware of the allegation against Mrs. Dickinson and we have no direct information at this time and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment upon it.

'Mrs. Dickinson has been on the Board of Education for 2 yrs and is the Treasurer of the Board.'

Dickinson was booked into the El Paso County jail on suspicion of Internet luring of a child, a Class 4 felony.

She has posted a $3,000 bond, but has been placed on administrative leave from her job as the Memorial Hospital where she works in the radiology department.
