Three people who died when their small plane struck a pickup truck on the runway have been identified as fraternity brothers from the University of Maine.

The victims of Friday night's crash were 22-year-old David Cheney, of Beverly, Massachusetts; 24-year-old Marcelo Rugini, an exchange student from Brazil; and 24-year-old William 'B.J.' Hannigan III, of South Portland, Maine.

All three were members of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Cheney was the fraternity's president.

'UMaine's Greek and international student communities are mourning the loss of three of their own, but they are not alone in their grief,' said Robert Dana, vice president for student affairs and dean of students.

'Losing these three young men - David, Marcelo and B.J. - is a loss for the entire UMaine community and the many people - including faculty and staff - whose lives they touched. They brought great light and energy to our campus, and we will miss them.'

Fraternity brothers: Marcelo Rugini was the third of the victims, who met through their frat house

Their Cessna 172 was believed to be traveling about 100mph and had just gone airborne when it clipped a pickup truck that was driving across the runway.

The plane kept climbing for a brief few seconds, reaching an altitude of about 100 feet, witnesses said.

Then
it veered eastward and spiraled down about 300 yards into a 
thickly-wooded area nearby and burst into flames, according to Knox 
County Chief Deputy Sheriff Tim Carroll.

The collision sent flames 10 to 20 feet in the air and smoke billowing into the sky, police said.

One fraternity brother, senior Lucas 
Bernardi, told the Bangor Daily News that the three had flown out of 
Bangor International Airport earlier in the day and then toward Lincoln 
County over a farm where one of the victims had worked over the summer.

He said one of the victims had just earned his pilot's licence and wanted to take his friends for a fun ride.

'It wasn't the first time they had been flying,' Mr Bernardi told the newspaper. 'I was supposed to go with them, but I didn't.'

Mr Hannigan, who graduated from the university in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering, was piloting the plane and had been working on his flight hours, Dana said.

Mr Cheney was a business major. Mr Rugini, who was from the town of Muliterno in southern Brazil, was an economics major.

Search: Authorities combed the woods nearby to find the wreckage and remains of the victims

Tragic: University officials paid tributes to the three young men who died in the accident

Lambda Chi Alpha has been in touch with the victims' families and has been keeping the university informed, Mr Dana said.

Fraternity members gathered in 
solidarity at their campus house Saturday night, and a police officer 
was stationed outside to keep away the media, the Bangor Daily News 
reported.

The
first people to the scene tried unsuccessfully to pull one of the 
occupants from the burning wreckage, said John Newcomb, president of the
Downeast Air airline services company, who was among those who tried to
help.

The
pickup truck that was struck by the plane was allowed to be at the 
airport and was driven by a pilot who was picking up another pilot who 
had parked a plane in a hangar, Mr Carroll said.

Crash
course: A Cessna 172 similar to this one crashed after hitting a truck 
that was crossing the runway just as the four-seater tried to take flight

Accident scene: Firefighters had difficulty accessing the woods around Knox County Regional Airport to extinguish the fiery plane crash that killed three Friday night

All trucks at the airport are equipped
with radios to pick up any traffic from planes, according to airport 
manager Jeff Northgraves.

He said planes are required to radio their positions before, during and after takeoff.

It is not yet known if the plane that crashed had radioed its actions.

Because
the plane's identification numbers had been burned off, ‘we don't have 
verification that this aircraft is what we think it is,’ Northgraves 
said.

Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and officials from the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.
