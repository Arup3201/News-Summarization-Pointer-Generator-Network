An al-Qaeda linked terror group has issued a chilling propaganda video threatening Western shopping centres and singling out 'Jewish owned' Westfield malls as targets.

In a 76-minute long message issued overnight, a masked militant purportedly from the al-Shabaab organisation encouraged Islamic fundamentalists to strike at shopping centres around the world.

Dressed in military fatigues, the spokesman named complexes owned by Frank Lowy's Australian group as among potential targets, dwelling on two Westfield malls in East and West London.

'If just a handful of mujahideen fighters could bring Kenya to a complete stand-still for nearly a week, just imagine what the dedicated mujahideen could do in the West to American or Jewish shopping centres across the world,' he said.

Chilling: A new video, apparently released by Al-Shabaab, calls for 'Westgate-style' attacks on shopping centres including two malls owned by the Australian company Westfield in London

Westgate siege: Donning a camouflage jacket with a headscarf covering his face, the fighter threatens action and refers to the group's 2013 siege on Kenya's Westgate Mall (pictured), in which more than 60 people died

Return fire: Shortly after the Westgate Mall incident in September 2013, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. More than 60 people died, while around 200 people were injured. Above, police in the shopping mall

‘What if such an attack on the Mall of America in Minnesota or the West Edmonton mall in Canada or in London’s Oxford Street. Or any of the hundred or so of the Jewish owned Westfield shopping centres. 

‘Take the Westfield shopping centre in (London's) Stratford or White City for example, what would be the implications of such an attack, one can only imagine.

‘All it takes is a man with firm determination, of which our Muslim ummah (community) has plenty of.

‘So hurry up and hasten to Heaven and do not hesitate.' 

A Canadian shopping complex and the Mall of America - the United States' biggest shopping centre, - were also listed as targets. No specific threats were made to Australian shopping centres.

Fighter: Sitting in front of a black background, the unidentified militant (pictured) says: 'If just a handful of mujahideen fighters could bring Kenya to a complete stand-still for nearly a week, just imagine what the dedicated mujahideen could do in the West to American or Jewish shopping centers across the world' 

Running to safety: In the newly-released video, Al-Shabaab describes the attack, complete with images of terrified men, women and children running through the mall for their lives. Above, people escape the mall

Terrifying: Shoppers are pictured crawling across the floor as they try to escape the mall in September 2013

Westfield was co-founded by Sydney resident Mr Lowy and operates scores of complexes in Australia, the United States and United Kingdom.

Daily Mail Australia has approached Westfield for comment about whether any precautions are being taken in Australian centres.

Shortly following the bloody September 2013 attack, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the Westgate siege which left 67 people dead and hundreds injured.

In the newly-released video, al-Shabaab runs a documentary-style account of the deadly attack, complete with images of terrified men, women and children running for their lives through the mall.

The footage, posted online by the terror group, includes images of terrorist activity and discusses Kenya's military intervention in Somalia. The masked militant then appears on-screen and suggests a range of attacks on the Western targets.  

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has warned visitors to the Mall of America to remain vigilant. 

'If anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' he told CNN. 

Targeted: The Mall of America (pictured)  in Bloomington, Minnesota, is America's largest shopping center. It boasts 40million visitors a year and contributes nearly $2billion in annual economic activity to Minnesota

Crowded: 'I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' Mr Johnson said  on CNN's 'State of the Union.' Above, the busy interior of the mall

Popular: The militant also encouraged radicalised Muslims to target Oxford Street (pictured) in London, England

Mentioned: The masked militant also calls for assaults on West Edmonton Mall (pictured) in Alberta, Canada
