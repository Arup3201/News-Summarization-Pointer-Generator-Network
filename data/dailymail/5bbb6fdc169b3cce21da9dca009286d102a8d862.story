A former U.S. army sergeant who became one of America's best-loved beauty queens is now set to host her own hunting show.

Theresa Vail became only the second ever army recruit to take part in the Miss America contest last year when she represented Kansas.

But while most competitors go on to get modelling contracts, 23-year-old Miss Vail has signed up to host a show with the US Outdoor Channel.

Former U.S. Army sergeant Theresa Vail became a huge hit in America when she refused to cover her tattoos while representing Kansas. She's now planning to put her military training to good use by hosting a hunting show on U.S. TV

She'll be hunting elk, deer and bear in the new show on the Outdoor Channel

Producers of the show say they are amazed by Miss Vail's hunting skills

She'll be showing off her passion for stalking deer and other mountain animals in a programme she hopes will 'empower women'.

Miss Vail enlisted in the army when she was 17 and is a section leader for the Kansas Army National Guard's Medical Attachment.

She was inspired to go into the armed forces by her father, who is a dentist in the Army and has been a soldier for 33 years, and she has a tattoo of the insignia of the Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder.

She shot to fame in the U.S. when she became the first contestant to openly display her tattoos at the Miss America beauty pageant.

The inking on her right side states: 'God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.'

Despite narrowly missing out on the Miss America 2014 title, she won the 'America's Choice' award, decided by an online vote.

In her latest move, she's signed up to host 'Limitless', a hunting show for US TV which is set to hit screens next year.

Despite being known as a crack-shot marksman, she told the Wichita Eagle: 'I'm not afraid to say, "Hey, I don’t know how to do this" but I want to learn and do it myself.

'That's empowering and more people need to do it. I will learn how and that’s the kind of thing that makes me so proud.'

Miss Vail followed her father, Mark, into the military and has recently signed up for another six years with the Kansas Army National Guard's Medical Detachment

The show, which Miss Vail began filming this month, will feature her taking part in three hunts for elk, several for deer and possibly one for bear.

She'll also be taking part in a number of extreme challenges, including training with New Mexico's Smoke Jumper firefighters and running in a desert marathon.

While hunting a number of animal with a bow and arrow, she'll be modelling a new camouflage range for an outdoor clothing firm.

She has previously campaigned to get more girls into hunting, camping and outdoor activities.

On her website, Miss Outdoor Girl, she writes: 'When girls learn they have what it takes to “hang with the guys” they feel a sense of internal strength, like they can conquer the world and take care of themselves.

'It is an immense confidence-booster and a great way for young girls to find themselves. This takes them out of the partying/drinking scene, and into the most natural of environments. I truly believe my platform will build responsible and respectable young.'
