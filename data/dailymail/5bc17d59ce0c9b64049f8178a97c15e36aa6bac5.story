Mother-of-three Milli Hill, 40, has shared her views on paternity leave in an online column

A mother-of-three has claimed that fathers are as 'useful as t*ts on a bull' following the arrival of a baby because newborns 'don't want dad'.

Milli Hill, 40, from Somerset, has stirred up controversy with her comments - written in a column for Best Daily - in response to the news Labour plan to extend paternity leave to four weeks.

She writes: 'This time of nurturing a tiny life is mainly (not 'just', but 'mainly'), for mums, and dads who have visions of bonding in this time are likely to end up feeling disappointed, left out and about as useful as t*ts on a bull.' 

She added: 'Whilst a woman can perform brain surgery or lead a multi-national, I'm afraid to break it to you that there is something a man can't do – and that's be a mother.

'As I discovered when I realised that my breast-pump was the worst twenty quid I ever spent: no matter what technology you employ or how good your intent, to a baby this is meaningless. 

'A small breastfed baby doesn't want a plastic teat and quite often, they don't want dad either. They just want you.

'More time for dads in the early weeks will be largely wasted, because, no matter what breast-pump manufacturers or Westminster policy makers might try to tell you, the so-called "Paternity Month" is actually a "Babymoon", an epic and life-changing love-in, and it belongs uniquely to mother and child.'

Milli's comments sparked a furious reaction on Twitter as parents responded to her views.

BeautifulBairns tweeted that Milli was 'utterly wrong' and Phyllida Warmington pointed out: 'I do think a dads presence in the early days in invaluable for practical/emotional support for the mother.'

Katherine Woodbury tweeted: 'My husband and I would have done ANYTHING for more time together. Not all births/PN are straightforward.'

Jonathan, 39, a father-of-two, from Hertfordshire, said he was outraged by Milli's comments.

He told MailOnline: 'She's made me angry as she generalises and assumes the early days of having a baby are the same for all parents. In fact, childbirth and the days that follow are a unique experience and different for everyone.'

Jonathan said that Milli fails to consider how mothers may need the support of their partner if they are recovering from a caesarean section, have other children to attend to, or are simply overwhelmed by becoming a new mother.

His own wife had C-sections to deliver both their children and he said she needed him more than ever afterwards. He said she would have struggled if he had not been able to take an extra week holiday following his two-week paternity leave.

Milli's article prompted reaction on social media including this tweet from Katherine Woodbury, left, who said mothers need their partner if a birth was not straightforward, and 'King Of Dads said they were irked, right

He said: 'Particularly after our second child was born, I was needed at home to help look after our two-year-old. 

'I wanted to be there to get to know my children and to support my wife, even if that just meant making her a cup of tea.' 

He added he could bond with his newborns by skin-on-skin contact even if he couldn't feed them. 

Parenting blogger Tom Briggs, who runs the website diaryofthedad.co.uk, agrees. 

He said: 'I'd say that it's essential that dads are around from birth - although there are things that we obviously can't do, such as breastfeeding, there's lots that we can do to support our partners and, just as importantly, bond with our children. 

'If you take into consideration the fact that we're already at a disadvantage due to biological reasons, it's even more important that we're about in the first few weeks to bond with them and I don't think she has considered dads' feelings. 

'The first few weeks of being a parent is certainly not something that's exclusive to mother and child. Parenting is a shared privilege and responsibility from the word go.'

Speaking to MailOnline today, Milli said she was sorry if her article had offended parents. 

She said: 'I'm aware that the article has sparked controversy and I am extremely sorry if I have offended fathers - this was not my intention. 

'I do wish I had written more about the importance of fathers but the focus of my article was motherhood and the point I wished to make was that, in particular in the early weeks, there is a mother-baby relationship underway which is very intense and special. 

Milli believes the most important person to a newborn is their mother and the 'babymoon' belongs uniquely to them, meaning fathers can feel left out (file photo)

'Fathers can of course - and do - support mums by taking care of the house, shopping etc and this is fantastic. But the fundamental bonding time that is taking place is largely between mum and baby and I don't think we should be afraid of saying this.

'I think that it would be great if dads could have more flexible time off after birth - I understand in Australia for example they can take the paternity leave at any time in the first year which makes a lot more sense. 

'I'm just not convinced that, if we are saying that dads can only have four weeks off, that weeks two to four are the best time for them to take this leave.'

Acknowledging Jonathan's point that mothers may need extra support after a caesarean birth or if they are struggling with post natal depression, or feeling overwhelmed, she said: 'Mothers are still going to struggle if dad has four weeks off and then returns to work. 

'What is needed for these women - and ALL women - is better support: better preparation for motherhood, better birth experiences, better follow-up from midwives (and this means more midwives) and better support networks around them.'

Milli wrote her thought-provoking piece in response to Labour leader Ed Miliband's announcement that his party would increase paternity pay to £260-a-week, the equivalent of the minimum wage, so more working fathers can afford to take time off.

The father-of-two believes more dads want to play a hands-on role in childcare but are 'frustrated by out-dated laws and entitlements'.

Jonathan admits he would have been unlikely to take four weeks paternity leave had it been available when his children were born because it would have meant they had less money coming in. But he thinks it's important fathers have the option.

'The choice should be there. Fathers spending more time with their children can only be a good thing,' he said.

'Many fathers won't take a month off because of finances and the pressure from colleagues to return to work. We need a cultural change so a father taking a month off after his child is born isn't unusual.'
