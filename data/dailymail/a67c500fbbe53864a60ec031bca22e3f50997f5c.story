Millions watched as she powered to victory in the heptathlon – but they might struggle to recognise her now.

After months of gruelling training, gold medallist Jessica Ennis finally got to kick off her trainers and put her feet up yesterday as she was given a makeover.

The 26-year-old, who won Britain’s first gold heptathlon medal in 12 years on Saturday, swapped her athletics gear for a pink skater dress and high heels as she visited a beauty salon in central London.

A team of hair stylists and make-up artists swept her hair up into a sleek bun and applied heavy eye shadow and fake eyelashes to the usually fresh-faced athlete.

She completed her look with gold earrings and gold nail varnish – admitting that she hadn’t dared to tempt fate by wearing anything gold during the Games.

She said: ‘I didn’t want to jinx myself, but now, lots of gold. I’m going to enjoy it.’

Preened: While the Olay ambassador seemed delighted with the results of her makeover at the Wella Studio, near Regents Park, it certainly provided some good publicity for the cosmetics firm

Lucrative: The Sheffield-born heptathlete could earn up to £5million in sponsorship deals off the back of the Olympics, according to experts

Ennis, who will marry construction 
site manager Andy Hill, 29, in May, seemed to be enjoying some downtime 
after the pressure of being one of Britain’s big Olympic medal hopes 
over the last year.

Looks can be deceiving, however, and 
the salon in question was coincidentally run by P&G, the owner of 
Olay and one of Ennis’s key sponsors.

While the Olay ambassador seemed delighted with the results of her makeover at the Wella Studio, near Regents Park, it certainly provided some good publicity for the cosmetics firm.

The Sheffield-born heptathlete could 
earn up to £5million in sponsorship deals off the back of the Olympics, 
according to experts.

She
already has sponsorship deals with several large companies, including 
Adidas, BP, Aviva, Omega, British Airways, Jaguar and Powerade.

Her Adidas deal alone is worth up to 
£320,000 a year.

She was also given a £78,930 Jaguar XKR by the 
car company this year.

Her
extraordinary earnings are a far cry from her modest upbringing in a 
terraced house in Sheffield, where she was raised by her painter and 
decorator father Vinnie Ennis and social worker mother Alison Powell.

Later in the day she wore a pretty peach skater dress when she attended a VIP party at Omega House, in London's Soho.

The golden girl posed with Downton Abbey stars Allen Leech, Laura Carmichael, and Dan Stevens.

She was also seen with actress Lily James, who features in Fast Girls, a film about British athletics. 

Athletes and their families have been
offered complimentary beauty and grooming treatments at the P&G 
salons, one of which is in the Athletes' Village, during the Games.

They
will offer up to 25,000 treatments over the Olympics as part of their 
‘Thank You Mum’ campaign, which celebrates the sacrifices that athletes’
mothers make for their children.
