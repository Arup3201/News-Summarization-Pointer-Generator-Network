US Airways has sparked outrage after a flight attendant allegedly refused to hang up an Army Ranger and combat veteran's jacket to stop it from creasing.

First Sergeant Albert Marle was wearing a jacket lined with medals when he boarded Flight 1930 from Portland, Oregon, to Charlotte, North Carolina, yesterday.

But when he asked an attendant to hang up his 'Dress Blues' uniform, she reportedly refused, saying the coat closet was for first-class passengers only and he was seated in coach.

'Her response wasn't that there's not space in the coat closet or "I've hung too many jackets up",' said Brian Kirby, a first-class passenger on the four-hour flight.

'It was just simply,"Our airline policy says I'm not going to do it, so I'm not going to do it." I was really appalled at not only the way she looked at him but the way she spoke to him - in an angry way.'

Shocked first-class fliers then offered their seats to Sgt Marle, but the decorated soldier politely declined their offers and remained seated in coach, passengers told WSOC TV in Charlotte.  

Some even claimed the flight attendant shouted at fliers who tried to ask other attendants to hang up Sgt Marle's decorated jacket to prevent it from wrinkling.

Outrage: After passengers spread word of the incident online, it quickly went viral, with thousands of social media users (including Brian Kirby, above) condemning the airline's 'shameful' behavior toward Sgt Marle

Amid the chaos, passenger Jon Dahlberg took it upon himself to take the item of clothing from 'humble' Sgt Marle, before hanging it behind his own seat, according to reports.

'I walked back up and hung the jacket simply behind my seat. There’s a difference between policy and doing what is right,' said Mr Dahlberg.  

After passengers spread word of the incident online, it quickly went viral, with thousands of social media users condemning the airline for its 'shameful' behavior toward Sgt Marle.

Mr Kirby took to Twitter to express his disgust, writing: 'Do not fly US Air, I have just witnessed a US soldier heavily decorated disgraced. Will be sharing with other media outlets ASAP.'

Angered: Addressing US Airways, Mr Kirby, also a passenger on the flight, tweeted: According to my flight attendant you have a policy to not hang the dress coats of Army Rangers not seated in first class #antiusair'

Questioning the policy: Meanwhile, Mr Kirby's wife, Laura, tweeted the airline directly, saying: '@USAirways is it really in your policy to disrespect brave men such as Sergeant Marle?'

Passengers: Mr and Mrs Kirby (pictured speaking to WSOC TV Channel 9 yesterday) said of the flight attendant: 'Her response was just simply,"Our airline policy says I'm not going to do it, so I'm not going to do it"'

Meanwhile, his wife, Laura Kirby, tweeted the airline directly, saying: '@USAirways is it really in your policy to disrespect brave men such as Sergeant Marle?'

And Twitter user Hays Parks said: 'You don't respect military personnel. You owe that Army Ranger an apology, not excuses.'

Cliff Authrey, who was also a passenger on Flight 1930, even claimed he was considering switching to a frequent flyer club of another airline following the incident.

Response: U.S. Airways tweeted Mrs Kirby back saying: 'We have great respect for our Military personnel'

Hitting out: But Twitter user Hays Parks said: 'You don't respect military personnel' You owe [him] an apology'

However, others pointed out that Sgt Marle should not be entitled to special treatment simply because of his job. 

At the time of the incident, a U.S. Airways spokesman reportedly said Sgt Marle's request was declined because he was the fourth person to ask and the closet did not have any space.

However, this afternoon, the airline issued an apology for the flight attendant's alleged response, saying it was reviewing the incident internally and wanted to thank Sgt Marle for his service. 

Army base: According to officials at Fort Bragg (pictured), the medals of Sgt Marle's jacket show he is qualified in the fields of Ranger, Pathfinder, Air Assault, Special Forces and is likely serving in an airborne unit

A spokesman said: 'We have a long and proud history of serving our military members and hold the men and women who serve our country in the highest regard.'

According to officials at Fort Bragg, the medals of Sgt Marle's jacket show he is qualified in the fields of Ranger, Pathfinder, Air Assault, Special Forces and is likely currently serving in an airborne unit.

He has  been wearing the uniform on job interviews across the country while pursuing his dream to become a doctor, his family told Channel 9. They refused to comment further.
