West Ham have made a £9.5million bid for Yehven Konoplyanka but face competition from Roma and Atletico Madrid.

Dnipro want £12m for the Ukraine winger who missed out on a move to Liverpool in January and has been watched by Tottenham and Manchester United.

Atletico, who are signing Bayern Munich's Mario Mandzukic for £17.4m, plan talks on Wednesday with the Ukrainian's father and agent while West Ham consider other options also.

Done deal? West Ham have bid £9.5million for Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka

Liverpool offered Konoplyanka close to £6million-a-year in wages and he will have to become the Upton Park outfit's top earner, outstripping the £75,000-a-week deal of Andy Carroll, to join.

Konoplyanka scored 13 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions for Ukrainian outfit Dnipro last season.

West Ham had also considered his Ukraine team-mate Andriy Yarmolenko at Dynamo Kiev but face competition from Chelsea for him.

Meanwhile, Stoke are rivalling West Ham for Ecuador striker Enner Valencia of Pachuca.
