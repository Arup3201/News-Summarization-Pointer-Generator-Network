Police are chasing new leads in the Madeleine McCann case after being swamped by almost 1,000 tip-offs from the public.

Detectives are working their way through 730 calls and 212 emails following the biggest ever response to an appeal on BBC Crimewatch.

A number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched Madeleine from her bed minutes before her mother Kate found she was missing.

Fresh leads: British police are chasing new leads in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann after being swamped by almost 1,000 tip-offs

Prime suspect: These e-fits are of the man seen carrying a child 500 
yards from the McCanns' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal

'Delighted': Kate and Gerry McCann said they were 'absolutely delighted' at the 'overwhelming' response following the Crimewatch appeal

Detectives believe a sighting of a man carrying a blonde girl 500 yards from the McCanns’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, is of ‘vital importance’.

But the account of Irish holidaymakers who saw the suspect has been called into question because they originally said they were ‘60 to 80 per cent sure’ it was Madeleine’s father Gerry.

Police have however said they are certain Mr McCann is not involved.

Martin and Mary Smith gave police a signed statement when they returned home to Drogheda, County Louth.

New timeline: The Crimewatch special revealed that police were now looking at Madeleine's abduction as being at 10pm and not 9.15pm

They said they had seen a man carrying a child toward Praia da Luz’s beach at 10pm on the night Madeleine disappeared – May 3, 2007.

Metodo 3, a detective agency hired by the McCanns, produced two e-fits of the man in 2008 based on the Smiths’ account. 

Crimewatch's Madeline McCann 
special was the most watched edition of the BBC show in its 29 year 
history, attracting more than seven million viewers.

The
 hour long programme, which saw Scotland Yard reveal new findings, 
peaked with 7.3 million, 30 per cent of the total audience share in the 
five minutes from 9.25pm.

The
 show had an average of 6.7 million viewers, 27.4 per cent of the share,
 adding almost three million viewers to the channel's slot average of 
3.9 million, nearly half the audience share enjoyed on Monday.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'It is the highest audience for a Crimewatch programme on record, going back to 2002.'

The BBC does not have audience figures for Crimewatch, pre-dating that. It was first broadcast in 1984.

Monday
 night's Crimewatch was up against the popular ITV series Doc Marten 
which drew an average audience of seven million. The previous series 
high on March 31st, 2008, recorded 5.5 million (24 per cent). The ten 
minute update at 10:35pm also attracted 3.3 million (22.5 per cent).

BBC
 head of communications Sam Hodges, responding to a criticism on Twitter
 it was a 'ghastly ratings chaser', suggested the big audience was 'a 
reflection of the public interest'.

The images were made public this week when Scotland Yard revealed the mystery man is now the prime suspect.

The detective leading the Metropolitan Police investigation is expected to travel to Ireland in the coming weeks.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said he was extremely pleased with the response to Monday night’s Crimewatch appeal.

‘We have now had over 730 calls and 212 emails as a direct result of the specific lines of inquiry we issued yesterday concerning events in the lead up to, and on the night of Thursday 3rd May 2007 when Madeleine was abducted,’ he said.

‘Detectives are now trawling through and prioritising that material. This will take time.’

Mr Redwood, who insists Mr McCann had nothing to do with his daughter’s disappearance, said two independent callers had put forward the same name for the suspect.

Another caller gave the name of a man who was known to be in Portugal at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance.

Mr Redwood said officers were waiting to ‘action the information’ and 40 people were ready to take further calls.

With 6.7million viewers, the appeal attracted the biggest Crimewatch audience on record – almost double the average of 3.9 million.

A BBC spokesman said it also had the highest number of calls ever received, more than double the usual number.

The programme’s editor Joe Mather said: ‘Significantly, there were lots of calls from British people who were in Praia da Luz around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance who had never previously spoken to the Met, so there’s lots of information coming through there.

‘They received several names for the key 10pm sighting, the sighting of a man carrying a child toward the beach.

‘Several different names but also several callers mentioned the same name for that man.’

The Met is now taking the appeal to Holland where appeals were shown last night and a missing persons programme will be broadcast in Germany tonight.

Investigators are keen to trace a number of fair-haired men seen lurking around the holiday apartments at the time who could be Dutch or German.

A reward of up to £20,000 is being offered for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of those responsible for Madeleine’s abduction.

Yesterday a spokesman for the McCanns said: ‘We are absolutely delighted with the overwhelming public response to Crimewatch.

‘We know that the public desperately want to help the search for Madeleine. We are genuinely hopeful that one or more of these responses will lead to a major breakthrough in the investigation.’

The new Crimewatch appeal focused on a claim by an Irish family that they saw a man carrying a child through Praia da Luz at around the time Madeleine McCann was found to be missing.

Two differing e-fits of the suspect were issued, and police say it is possible the family did see the three-year-old being spirited away by her abductor.

was in the resort with his family when Maddie disappeared

The sighting came when Martin Smith, a retired businessman in his 70s, was walking back to his apartment in the Algarve resort following a meal and drinks at a bar with his wife and children.

At a spot a six-minute walk from the McCanns’ holiday accommodation, they saw a man carrying a blonde child aged around four. It was just before 10pm and the street lighting was poor.

Although Mr Smith admitted he was not wearing his glasses at the time he later said he thought the man could have been Gerry McCann.

This is an impossibility as dozens of witnesses confirmed he was at the holiday complex at 10pm. British police have also said they are certain that Mr McCann has nothing to do with his daughter’s appearance.

Speaking to Portuguese police a few weeks after Maddie disappeared, Mr Smith said it was ‘not possible to recognise the individual’.

His grandchildren were also unable to identify the man or the girl – but thought she could have been Madeleine.

Yet in September 2007 Mr Smith suddenly called police again to say he believed the man he saw could have been Gerry McCann. He had been watching television coverage of the family returning to Britain. However numerous witnesses say they were with Mr McCann at the tapas restaurant at the time in question – so he could not possibly have been 500 yards away.

This has led to Mr Smith’s account being called into question.

The retired businessman from County Louth, Ireland, was staying in Praia da Luz with his wife Mary, now 65, his son Peter and his wife and their children. He part owned an apartment in the resort and visited it three times a year.
