The ousted founder of American Apparel has accused the board of conducting a 'hateful campaign' against him.

Dov Charney was fired last week with the board citing his alleged misuse of company funds and role in disseminating nude photos of an ex-employee who filed a case against him in 2011.

But Mr Charney, 45, has now described the allegations as false and insisted he is still the 'best man for this job'.

Dov Charney has accused the board of American Apparel of conducting a 'hateful campaign' against him

In his first interview since being fired, Mr Charney told the Financial Times: 'I think it's highly unusual that a board - any board - would indulge in such a hateful PR campaign against its founder.'

American Apparel most recently said that they decided to fire Charney based on information saying he allowed an employee to impersonate and post naked photos online of a former employee who sued Charney in 2011 for $260 million after she claimed he forced her to be his 'sex slave.'

The case was thrown out in 2012 but the former employer was subject to an online campaign to discredit her and Charney is now facing claims he failed to stop it.

The New York Post
 has reported that Charney was expected to say that he did not know about the 
blog before it was published online and therefore isn't responsible for 
the 'liabilities' cited by American Apparel.

Charney's
 lawyers have pointed out that the board renewed his employment in April
 2012; more than a year after the blog was published.

On Monday, the independent directors of the retailer rejected a demand to meet and reinstate Mr Charney, a source close to the matter said.

Irene Morales, 21, said that Charney allegedly made her his sex slave and new information states Charney may have allowed an employee to impersonate her online

Charney's lawyer demanded a meeting on Monday, and the board's refusal to meet with and reinstate him makes a legal battle with the ex-CEO, who still controls 27 percent of the company's stock, more likely.

In the letter to the board, sent on Thursday, lawyer Patricia Glaser said the company had failed to give Charney 21 days' notice of his severance package as required by law, making his dismissal 'not only unconscionable but illegal.'

A link to the letter, whose receipt the source familiar with the matter confirmed, was provided in an article on the Wall Street Journal's website.

The letter threatened legal action should Mr Charney not regain his executive positions.

The board sees no point in meeting with Charney at this time, the source said.

The management shakeup followed years of company stagnation, as the company amassed more than $250 million in debt.

The
 company's co-chairman, meanwhile, has also said this week the company 
was not for sale and that the search for a new chief executive had 
generated 'enormous interest.'

Allan Mayer, the company's new co-chairman, also told Reuters that American Apparel did not need immediate capital.

He said: 'We are certainly not looking to sell the company.

'If
 someone came and said they want to buy American Apparel for $10 per 
share, we'd be crazy to not listen ... but by no means looking to sell 
now.'
