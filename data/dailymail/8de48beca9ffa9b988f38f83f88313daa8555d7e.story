A former nurse with Parkinson’s disease is studying a ‘memory book’ created for him by his ten-year-old son to help ward off dementia.

Chris Ley, 45, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2011 - five years after suffering a stroke.

He feared he would develop memory loss, which can be a symptom of the disease, so decided to ward off dementia by ‘training the brain’ with pictures of his family.

Joseph Ley, 10, created a 'memory book' for his father, Chris, who suffers from Parkinson's disease and fears he will develop memory loss. Mr Ley says he uses the book to 'train his brain' and ward off dementia

Mr Ley, who was forced to give up work as a male nurse following his diagnosis, is now able to examine pictures of his past thanks to Joseph’s ‘memory book’.

The book contains pictures of each of Mr Ley’s five children’s first day of school as well as photos of their birthday parties and of family holidays.

So far, Joseph has collected dozens pictures of his mother Elaine, 44, and siblings Ethan, 15, Rebecca, 13, Rachel, seven, and Malachi, four.

The youngster, who also helps care for his dad, said he wanted to surprise his dad with the touching gift.

He said: ‘I wanted to make it a surprise for my dad. I felt really excited and happy to tell him. I did it for all the family.

‘Like the rest of my siblings, I like to help. I pick my dad up when he’s fallen over, fetch his clothes and medication for him, cut up his food at dinner time and help with jobs around the house.’

The book contains pictures of each of Mr Ley's five children's first day of school as well as of their birthday parties and of family holidays. He says it reminds him of who he was before he fell ill

Mr Ley said: ‘I was overwhelmed and surprised that my son had done something so nice for me.

‘He is the kindest boy and always helps me.

‘Every activity we do we take photos to build memories so this will make a wonderful one.

‘I will be right there by his side to have my picture taken with him.

‘The symptoms of my disease are stable with medication but I am concerned that in the future I could suffer memory loss and I want to train my brain to stay alert.

‘By looking through the old pictures of my family it reminds me who I was before my stroke and before I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s.

Mr Ley says that he was 'overwhelmed and surprised' that his son had done something so kind. He says he hopes that reminding his brain who he was will help him in the future

‘I know my symptoms will get worse in the future but I want to fight back. I was not always like this and my children know that too.

‘I’m not someone who can just sit back and accept what is happening to me so I feel by reminding my brain who I was can help me in the future.’

The family were forced to relocate last year from Dundee, Scotland, back to Mr Ley’s native Beeston, in Nottinghamshire, to receive support from relatives.

About 127,000 people - one in 500 - in the UK suffer from Parkinson’s disease, which is caused by a lack of dopamine in the brain.

Most sufferers are over 50, but one in 20 are under 40 – these are known as early onset cases.

The most common symptoms include shaking, slow movement and rigidity, but mild memory loss and cognitive impairment can also occur.
