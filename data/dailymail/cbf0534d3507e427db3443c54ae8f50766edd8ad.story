Warren Gatland has compared Saturday’s tie between Wales and Ireland to a sibling rivalry but insists there is no ‘bad blood’ between the Celtic neighbours.

During his early years as national coach, Gatland said his squad ‘dislike the Irish players the most’ - remarks that he later described as a ‘backhanded compliment’ - because of the competition between the Welsh regions and Irish provinces.

But the Kiwi on Tuesday played down any animosity ahead of the RBS 6 Nations tie, insisting his players are no longer hung up on Leinster and Munster’s dominance in European competition.

Warren Gatland says there is no longer bad blood between Celtic Six Nations rivals, more a sibling rivalry 

‘Some of our players had been used to being regularly dominated by the Irish provinces,’ said Gatland. 

‘But it has been pretty even over recent years and there are no hard feelings or bad blood between the two teams, just a very strong rivalry when you know each other so well and play each other so often.

‘It’s like playing against your big brother in the back yard. You want to beat him as often as you can and Saturday will be no different. Last weekend was the first time since 2010 that all four Welsh regions won against Irish provinces. It was a big boost for us and for the players; they came in this week with a spring in their step.’

Warburton leads his side into a must win encounter that could keep their Six Nations hopes alive

Wales centre Jonathan Davies will be part of an unchanged starting XV to the one that beat France

A win for Wales would keep alive Gatland’s championship ambitions, and derail Irish hopes of a Grand Slam. 

Wales have kept faith in the starting XV who beat France, confirming that Sam Warburton is fit to become his country’s most capped captain. 

Ireland name their team on Wednesday and fly-half Jonathan Sexton is expected to be fit after a hamstring injury.

Backs: L Halfpenny; G North, J Davies, J Roberts, L Williams; D Biggar, R Webb; 

Forwards: G Jenkins, S Baldwin, S Lee, L Charteris, A-W Jones, D Lydiate, T Faletau, S Warburton (capt). 

Subs: R Hibbard, R Evans, A Jarvis, J Ball, J Tipuric, M Phillips, R Priestland, S Williams
