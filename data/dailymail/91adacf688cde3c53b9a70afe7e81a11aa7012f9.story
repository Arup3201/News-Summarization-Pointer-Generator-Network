The FA have promoted Dan Ashworth to technical director with little or no fanfare considering the importance of the role within the structure of English football’s ruling body.

There was no official announcement of Ashworth’s step up from director of elite development - his title since arriving from West Bromwich Albion in 2012. Instead, Ashworth was first named technical director on the FA website in the report on Gareth Southgate extending his England Under 21 contract.

It is understood the FA did not feel it necessary to promote the change of title as Ashworth has effectively been carrying out the technical director brief since the World Cup.

And the FA board had unanimously bought into his blueprint for the future organisation of England teams following his presentation as part of the postmortem into the England debacle in Brazil

Also FA chairman Greg Dyke had publicly anointed Ashworth as the technical director when outlining his second England commission report last October.

English rugby’s dysfunctional approach to fighting the secondary ticket market has resulted in ER 2015 employing Ticketmaster as their official ticket supply partner only on condition their secondary sites Seatwave and GetMeIn! do not sell World Cup tickets. 

Yet GetMeIn! are trading Six Nations tickets for England games despite the RFU having had an agreement for them not to in previous years.

Joao Havelange, godfather of FIFA corruption who took bribes from former marketing partners ISL, could reach his 100th birthday in May 2016 before Rio host the Olympics.

But after Havelange’s long fall from grace, Games organisers hope the stadium named after him, which will host the athletics, will henceforth be known as the Olympic Stadium — even if Havelange’s discredited name remains on the signage.

Meanwhile, the relatively calm build-up to the Rio Olympics compared to the Brazil World Cup is being helped by the close relationship between the IOC and the local organising committee. FIFA in contrast was regarded as an unwelcome foreign power.

FIFA secretary-general Jerome Valcke caused a furore when he said preparations needed a ‘kick up the backside’, while Rio 2016 communications director Mario Andrada says: ‘I don’t think the IOC need to say so.’

The major problem with Rio 2016 venues remains the troublesome £15million golf course, which is built on ecologically sensitive land. After years of planning difficulties, grass has finally been sown. But 50 protesters are camped outside complaining about damage to the fragile environment. They want the course lay-out changed to protect endangered species but water systems are already in place.

RYDER CUP BUS REBATE

Credit to Ryder Cup Europe. They have reacted to horror stories — highlighted by Sports Agenda — about the official bus transport from Glasgow to Gleneagles during the tournament last September by refunding media visitors £50 per night of their hotel stay as a goodwill gesture.

Ryder Cup Europe have refunded media visitors £50 per night of their hotel stay after horror travel stories

Europe retained the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September, but some had problems travelling to the course

The local drivers frequently got lost on the single road route and one even stopped his coach for half an hour on the way to the course because he had completed his allotted hours.

Sports Agenda will be using Ryder Cup Europe’s unprecedented action as a benchmark as to how event organisers should respond after poor service. Ryder Cup chief Richard Hills said: ‘If we get something wrong, we will put our hands up.’

The New FIFA Now summit in Brussels on Wednesday has attracted a number of the usual go-to suspects when it comes to needing a soundbite bashing FIFA. Unfortunately this wholly worthwhile initiative of Tory MP Damian Collins is not being attended by any representative of a FIFA national football association — all fearful, no doubt, like the FA, of giving the event extra credence by their presence. Collins said: ‘We would like them to be there, and a lot of people in football support change, but do not have the courage of their convictions to speak out when it is vital to do so.’
