Fabio Borini’s move to Sunderland could be back on after the club held talks with the Liverpool striker.

The Black Cats tabled a £14million bid earlier this month for the Italian, who enjoyed a successful loan spell at the Stadium of Light last season.

And when that offer was accepted it appeared Borini would be returning to the North East.

Concern: Borini receives treatment after falling awkwardly against Roma during their pre-season tour

However, the 23-year-old travelled 
with Liverpool to America for their pre-season tour only to suffer a 
shoulder injury and return to the UK for treatment.

He has since spoken to Sunderland although his injury is a complicating factor.

As,
 too, is Liverpool’s decision not to sign QPR frontman Loic Remy after 
he failed a medical at the weekend and manager Brendan Rodgers says 
Borini’s situation has an impact on their pursuit of another forward.

Sunderland
 boss Gus Poyet, meanwhile, is keen to bring the Italy forward 
back to Wearside but will not allow the proposed deal to drag on beyond 
the start of the season.
