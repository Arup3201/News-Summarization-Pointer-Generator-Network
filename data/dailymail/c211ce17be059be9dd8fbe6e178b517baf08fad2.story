Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is being investigated by police for failing to stop after colliding with a parked car

Ed Balls is under police investigation after he pranged a parked car and left the scene without informing the owner.

The Shadow Chancellor yesterday admitted that he had caused damage to a vehicle while performing a ‘seven point turn’ near his constituency office in Morley, West Yorkshire.

He said he took ‘full responsibility’ for the accident but said he was ‘unaware’ that he had caused any damage until he was spotted on CCTV footage.

Pictures of Mr Balls’ ageing Ford Mondeo estate clearly show scratch marks on the bumper, but his spokesman insisted they were the result of police taking a paint sample from the vehicle.

Nevertheless, the revelation that Mr Balls did not come clean about the incident immediately is embarrassing for the Shadow Chancellor.

West Yorkshire Police confirmed officers were making inquiries into a ‘fail to stop collision’ on Saturday, April 5.

‘Damage was caused to the front offside wing of a parked black Peugeot 306.

Enquiries are continuing,’ a spokesman said.

In a statement, Mr Balls said: ‘I was aware that at one point the bumpers of the two cars touched.

‘But until I was contacted the following Wednesday, I had no awareness at all that there had been any damage to the other car.

‘As soon as I was made aware, I took full responsibility. I have written to the owner to say I was terribly sorry and to reimburse [him] for the necessary repair.’

The Peugeot’s 32-year-old owner Dan Rowley – who has never voted – said he did not realise there was damage until the following day.

A CCTV camera on nearby flats had captured the collision and the incident was reported to police.

In
 2010 Mr Balls admitted he had been 'stupid' after he was fined £60 and 
given three points after being caught talking on his mobile phone while 
driving.

In June last year, Mr Balls was fined for going through a red light in his car after leaving Parliament.

And
 in April the same year, he said he had been caught speeding while 
driving at 56mph in a 50mph zone, in his West Yorkshire constituency.

It is the third time Mr Balls has run into trouble behind the wheel.

He was hit with a three-point penalty and a £60 fine in April 2010 when he was caught using his mobile phone while driving.

Last
 year he was fined and went on a speed awareness course when he was 
caught driving at 56mph in a 50mph zone near to his constituency home.

The
 latest incident has provoked glee among Tories, who have sought to 
brand Mr Balls as the man who helped crash the economy in 2008.

A Tory official added: ‘Balls did a seven point turn, which sounds very like Labour’s economic policy as the economy improves.’
