Jail time: Ronnie Barker's son Adam Barker could receive £1.4million when released

The paedophile son of actor Ronnie Barker is expected to receive an inheritance of more than £1.4m when he is released from jail in three months.

Adam Barker, 44, who was jailed for 12 months on Friday for child porn offences, inherited the money from his parents while he was on the run for eight years.

But it is believed that he never received any of the cash as nobody knew where he was hiding when he was living alone in Hungary.

Isleworth Crown Court heard how the former bit-part actor had only 'relatively recently' found out about the deaths of his parents.

Barker gave himself up at a police station in west London in July after returning to the UK as he had run out of funds.

He could be released in three months after serving half his sentence as he has already spent nearly three months on remand.

Ronnie Barker who was famed for his roles in TV jail comedy Porridge, Open All Hours and The Two Ronnies left an estate of £300,337 after he died of heart failure aged 76 in October 2005.

His will left £275,000 to be split between his three children - giving Adam just over £91,000 - and the rest to his wife Joy.

The bulk of his fortune did not feature in his estate as most jointly-held assets pass directly to a spouse.

Mrs Barker who lived near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds died aged 78 in January last year, leaving a net estate of £6,520,426 which was split equally between her three children.

Adam and his brother Larry, 52, and sister Charlotte, 49, inherited around £1,340,000 from their mother after inheritance tax and other expenses.

Charlotte was made executor of her mother's will, responsible for distributing her estate.

It is thought that the money due to her younger brother was left in an account waiting for him to claim it.

Adam Barker caused his father ‘unquantifiable distress’ after going on the run for eight years to avoid being prosecuted for child porn offences, a judge said.

He missed both his parents’ funerals as he hid in Hungary.

The 44-year-old’s whereabouts remained a mystery until he finally returned home to face justice earlier this year after his funds dried up.

He was jailed for a year after admitting possessing 1,675 indecent images of children at his home, including child rape.

Sentencing, Judge Rosa Dean told him: ‘Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children.’

Referring to a letter written by Barker’s sister to the court, she said it was clear his decision to flee ‘caused an unquantifiable distress to your family, and that must of course remain on your conscience.

'But for the court’s processes it means you prevented justice taking its course’.

Barker was arrested in 2003 as part of Operation Ore after police traced credit card payments he made for some of the images.

During a dawn raid on his home in Ealing, West London, he told a detective examining his computer:  ‘You’d better take it otherwise it would a dereliction of your duty.’

Barker, who appeared in the ITV detective series Wycliffe and had small parts in Monarch of the Glen, Casualty and the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, was released on bail while officers liaised with prosecutors about what charges to bring.

But he vanished leaving a note for 
his parents, which read: ‘Dear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police
came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my 
computer. I was arrested.

‘I
must apologise for being foolish and thank you for being great parents.
Rather than wait and find out what will happen, I will go away. You 
must understand that I won’t be able to contact you for quite some 
time.’

Ravinder Johal,
prosecuting, told Isleworth Crown Court: ‘What we know now is that Mr 
Barker fled to Hungary where he stayed for eight years, returning in 
July when it appears that he ran out of funds.’

Barker’s father never spoke publicly about his son’s disappearance and friends said that he ‘died of a broken heart’.

Detectives were waiting to question his son at the memorial service held at Westminster Abbey, but he did not turn up.

He also missed the funeral of his mother Joy, who died aged 78 after a short illness last January.

It remains unclear whether he will collect it.

Simon Ray, defending, said Barker had not been aware of their deaths until recently.

‘This is a source of sorrow and grief for him. He is profoundly sorry for the fact that is caused distress for his family. He accepts that what he did was wholly wrong.’

Barker claims that he did not own a computer and never viewed child pornography during his time in Budapest.

However, the judge said: ‘Nobody is in a position to know what he was up to in Hungary.’

Barker pleaded guilty to 20 counts of child porn between January 1999 and June 2003.Of the 1,675 images and videos in his possession, 92 were graded level four – the second highest category.

Barker showed no emotion as he was jailed yesterday. None of his family attended the hearing.
