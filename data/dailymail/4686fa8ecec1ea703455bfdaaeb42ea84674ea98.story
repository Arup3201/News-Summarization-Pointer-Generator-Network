A gorilla born at a South Texas zoo last month is headed to Ohio to be introduced to a troop at a zoo there because the baby's mother has been ignoring her.

Officials from the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas have been caring for the yet-unnamed western lowland gorilla who was born on January 29.

She will be moved this week to the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden, where experts hope she will bond with two adult female gorillas kept there.

Zoo director Jerry Stones told UPI: 'The mother just ignored it and walked away; every once in a while thereâ€™s a female that does that.'

The baby gorilla was born last month to mother Kiazi and  a silverback male called Moja.

Carers at the zoo have been taking it in turns to make sure that the new arrival is fed every two hours.

Kiazi moved to the Gladys Porter Zoo in 2011 as part of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums species survival breeding plan.

The mother was from the Pittsburg Zoo & PPG Aquarium but was on a breeding loan transfer from the Cincinnati Zoo.
