Actress Natalie Dormer dazzled at The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 premiere on Monday night in an edgy mesh and satin gown. But the Natalie Dormer that appeared on screen as rebel spin doctor Cressida cut quite a different figure.

Sporting a semi-shaven head, androgynous clothing and an inking that runs from the the bald patch on her head down her neck, the star appears anything but glamorous in the new film.

But the 32-year-old Brit has described the high profile role as 'empowering' and claims that shaving her head was 'terrifying' but 'liberating'.

The actress told the Evening Standard she loved playing someone who was 'defined by her profession. It was gender irrelevant. It is nice to play a role not defined by romantic engagement.' 

She described her head shaving experience as 'terrifying at first' but also described it as a 'liberating experience'.                 

'So much of female identity is bound up in our hair,' she told the paper. 'It was fascinating to explore my idea of what makes me physically attractive. I felt empowered.'

The star also admitted that being inked all over for her role as Cressida, a filmmaker who helps heroine Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) rally support, gave her the taste for more tattoos. 

On the red carpet during the filming of the film Natalie embraced the semi-shaven head look - and managed to carry it off with style. She said shaving her head was 'terrifying' and 'liberating'.

She only held back when she thought about the implications on her time in bed. 'I love sleep and more tattoos as an actor mean an earlier pick-up call in the morning to cover them all up,' she said.

The Reading-born actress is the only British talent in the star-studded line-up for the new Hunger Games installment, which as well as Jennifer Lawrence also stars Julianne Moore, Elizabeth Banks and Jena Malon.

And last night she brought her British brand of edgy to the red carpet with a sexy mismatched gown, showing how to do eclectic in style.

Best known for her role as Margaery Tyrell in the HBO series Game of Thrones, the actress often puts feminist causes top of her agenda.

She recently threw her support behind a new campaign to end violence against women and girls.

In powerful photographs taken for Plan UK's Because I Am A Girl campaign, she appeared with a series of phrases, including 'bear the scars' and 'no longer myself', scrawled on her cheeks.

She said: 'I believe we all have a part to play in the fight to end abuses like FGM and child marriage.

'It’s a powerful stance that we’re all taking, and by uniting together we can help keep millions of girls safe from harm.' 

Rising star Natalie has also played Anne Boleyn in hit TV series The Tudors and Irene Adler in American TV drama Elementary.

Her big screen appearances include A Long Way From Home and The Riot Club, the film version of Laura Wade's play, inspired by Prime Minister David Cameron's time in the infamous Bullingdon Club during his Oxford days.

With a flourishing career, the one thing that's had to take a back seat for the star are her wedding plans to Irish actor fiance Anthony Byrne, 39.

The couple have been engaged since 2011, but Natalie recently admitted she's been too busy to plan their nuptials.
