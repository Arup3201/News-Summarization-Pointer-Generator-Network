Newcastle United striker Adam Armstrong has revealed how an impromptu pep-talk from England captain Wayne Rooney inspired him to score three times for the under 18s last week.

The 18-year-old grew up idolising the Manchester United star, who was only too happy to share some tips on the art of goalscoring when the two met at St George's Park.

And the advice clearly sunk in as Armstrong went on to score three times in two friendly matches against Switzerland.

England under 18s striker Adam Armstrong received a pep-talk from Wayne Rooney last week that inspired him to three goals in two friendly matches against Switzerland

Rooney delivered a team talk to the whole of Neil Dewsnip's under 18 squad before having a one-on-one chat with Armstrong afterwards.

And the Geordie hotshot said: 'I played against him at Old Trafford and he said he liked the way that I always got across the defenders.

'He said that the Manchester United team had watched me in the clips before the game - that was a massive confidence booster for me to have someone like that say that.'

Armstrong added: 'He came into our meeting and answered questions from all the lads and then I managed to speak with him one-on-one.

'The lads were all getting photos with him and I just stayed behind after that, and the manager Neil Dewsnip asked if I could ask him a few questions about my game.

'I asked him what I can do for myself to improve as I try to play in the same way as him.

'He gave me loads of tips and advice, which was an unbelievable experience for me. Being such a young lads playing in the first-team, he told me that I always need to have confidence when I play and never be afraid to get my shots off.

'As a striker, he just said that I always need to have the belief to go again if it wasn't happening for me and the only way to reach the top level is to continue working hard every day.

'It might sound daft, but I've still got his poster on my bedroom door at home, so it was just class.'

While Rooney was scoring for the seniors in England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania, taking his international goal tally to 47, Armstrong improved his record for the Three Lions youth teams to 19 in 24 games.

He scored the winner in Thursday's behind-closed-doors friendly with Switzerland at St George's Park and then added two spectacular goals in a 6-1 win when the two teams reconvened at Walsall's Banks's Stadium on Saturday.

Armstrong has already accomplished a lot in his young career - he has made 14 first-team appearances for Newcastle and was part of the England under 17s team that won the European Championships in Malta last year.
