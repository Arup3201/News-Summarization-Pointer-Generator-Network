A 39-year-old Connecticut mother has been arrested after swinging her one-year-old daughter by her feet like a baseball bat while high on Ritalin.

Aurora Houghtaling of Naugatuck was allegedly swinging the baby around by her feet on Maple Street around 6:30pm Wednesday.

Police responding to several 911 calls managed to remove the child from her mother with difficulty after Houghtaling refused to stop swinging the baby.

Under arrest: Aurora Houghtaling, 39, was charged with risk of injury on Wednesday after swinging her one-year-old child by the feet like a baseball bat

According to Naugatuck Patch, Houghtaling was making irrational statements and appeared to be under the influence of drugs.

She later admitted she had been snorting crushed methylphedidate pills, or Ritalin.

The baby was taken to Connecticut Children's Medical Center for evaluation.

Houghtaling was arrested and charged with breach of peace, risk of injury to child, second-degree failure to appear and interfering with officer/resisting arrest.

The day before the incident, police were called to a local McDonald's where Houghtaling had begun threatening other customers.

A witness told WFSB that she said, 'If no one calls the cops I'm going to kill everyone in here and I'm going to kill myself.'

Houghtaling was taken to a local hospital for psychiatric evaluation where she remained Thursday evening.

According to Naugatuck Patch, Houghtaling has pending cases at Waterbury Superior Court for disorderly conduct and second-degree failure to appear. She has three prior convictions for second-degree failure to appear (two counts) and probation violation, for which she was sentenced to a year in jail after being arrested in Waterbury in 2006.

Heartfelt: Another of Houghtaling's children appears to address the incident in this plea to her mother to get help left on Facebook

A heartfelt message left on Houghtaling's Facebook page from another of her daughters appears to address the incident:

'Mom, 
never in my life have I ever met someone as beautiful and as smart as 
you. You make so many mistakes, and sometimes you learn and sometimes 
you don't. sometimes it takes a few tumbles down the hill to get back on
track. I wish I could of helped you. and I wish I was there when this 
happened,' wrote Caitlin Houghtaling.

'People like to make things look worse than they really are. 
and deep down, you are a wonderful woman. You're talented, and you've 
come a long way. You've made beautiful children who are smart and 
amazing. And we all do truly love you. We just hate to see you in pain 
and worsening yourself. Please get help, please for the sake of your 
children. I love you mom.'
