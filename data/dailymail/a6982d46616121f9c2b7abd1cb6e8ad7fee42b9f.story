More than any other teams in world football, Brazil and Argentina have come to be defined, in recent years, by their No 10s.

In Barcelona duo Lionel Messi and Neymar, the South American giants have arguably the best two players in the world in that position, and both teams are built around their respective superstars.

But how did the pair compare when they met in Beijing on Saturday?

INFLUENCE 

It might not be right to describe Brazil vs Argentina as simply Neymar vs Messi - but both teams rely so heavily on their star man that if either goes missing, the whole side can lose their way.

Brazil, as the World Cup showed, are only as good as their No 10, while Messi, on his day, can carry Argentina almost single-handedly.

It's not enough to be good, these two have to dominate the whole game to earn praise.

In the first half hour, there is no doubt who was winning this battle. Messi was involved in everything good that Argentina did, getting on the ball in deep areas, committing defenders and feeding his team-mates.

Not only did he beat defenders himself, but his very presence drew men away from his fellow forwards. Angel di Maria and Sergio Aguero had more space than they would normally be afforded by virtue of playing alongside Messi.

Neymar, heatmap above, was key to Brazil's forward play, particularly on the left and down the centre 

Neymar, meanwhile, was left isolated for much of the first half, lurking on the lonely left wing while Brazil struggled to get a foothold.

It was clear, whenever Dunga's side won the ball, that they were looking to their talisman for a lift, but possession was so rare (less than 35 per cent in the first half) that he was a peripheral figure.

In fact, Brazil's No 10 made just 10 passes in the entire first 45 minutes, less than a third of Messi's tally - and three of those 10 failed to find a team-mate.

But, after Diego Tardelli's opener, the 22-year-old came to life. Dazzling dribbles, incisive passes, and very nearly a superb solo goal.

Suddenly Neymar, without having too much of the ball, was the most exciting player on the pitch. Every time he got the ball he looked to have the beating of a desperately slow Argentina defence.

His pace and threat brought fouls and cards, and by the end of the game there was little doubt who the most threatening player on the pitch was.

CREATIVITY 

Both players are absolutely vital to their side's chance creation. Despite Chelsea duo Oscar and Willian alongside him, Neymar is the only genuine creative focal point in the Brazil side.

Argentina have a few more options, with Angel di Maria in particular diverting some of the pressure off Messi's shoulders, but the diminutive genuis is still the key man.

Neither of the two were particularly wonderful in a first half which lacked many clear-cut chances, but Messi offered slightly more, creating two chances for Sergio Aguero.

First he slid Pablo Zabaleta in behind before the full back's cross was mishit by Aguero, then he put the Manchester City striker in down the right hand channel, only for the forward to blaze over the bar.

Neymar, on the other hand, created only for himself in the opening 45, although this was enough to strike fear into the Argentinian defence.

He rectified that soon after half time, a perfectly weighted pass playing in Felipe Luis, who should really have made it 2-0, and then releasing Willian inside the box, who again was wasteful.

INDIVIDUAL BRILLIANCE 

While Brazil's new counter-attacking system relies on Neymar to do it all himself, Argentina's tactical set-up lets Messi drift in and out, before attacking from deeper areas.

Both systems are designed to get the best out of their major star, and both seemed to work fairly well in that respect.

Messi repeatedly picked up the ball from the right hand side and drove at the Brazilian defence, who usually responded by fouling him.

Mostly the Argentine beat at least one man, before spreading the play wide or winning a free kick in a dangerous area. The levels of excitement were certainly raised around the stadium when he got on the ball, but there were hints, rather than devastating examples, of what he can do on the ball.

As the need to take the game by the scruff of the neck increased with Brazil's two goals, Messi came further inside and began to run with the ball more.

Two shots soon after the hour mark tested Jefferson, though neither really threatened to find the back of the net.

Neymar, on the other hand, clearly had the upper hand in this particular duel. Out of the game for such long periods, the Brazil captain showed several times what he could do when given time and space.

Soon after the half hour Neymar went on three devastating dribbles in five short minutes, slicing through the Argentina defence with ease and very nearly taking the game away from his opponents single-handedly.

END PRODUCT 

For all their tricks and flicks, runs and rabonas, the pair will always be judged on their final touch.

In the first half, both were found seriously wanting. Messi, usually so deadly, fired two free kicks against the wall and failed to manufacture any shooting opportunities from open play.

Even when presented with the perfect opportunity from 12 yards the former World Player of the Year could only fire his spot-kick tamely at Jefferson.

The second half saw three decent efforts from the edge of the box, all of which brought saves from Jefferson, but only an 80th minute free-kick looked close to beating the Brazil keeper.

Neymar was little better. His best run, during which he ran from half-way, beating two men before drawing the keeper, ended with something of a whimper, a scuffed shot that trickled wide.

Then, early in the second half, the pacey Brazilian eased past the defence only to cut the ball back to no-one.

Even when put through one-on-one by Luis Gustavo against a goalkeeper stuck in no-mans-land, the young forward could only chip over the bar.

DEFENSIVE WORK 

Neither of these players is particularly noted for their work without the ball, but football is a team game, and no side can afford to carry a man, however talented, completely.

Messi has, this season, returned to his pressing game at Barcelona, and appeared keen to keep it up on Saturday.

No longer did we see the Argentine standing still or wandering around after losing the ball - Messi worked hard to win it back, and pressure defenders into mistakes.

In truth, the success of this was limited, but it was important for Tata Martino's gameplan that his talisman made an effort when out of possession.

Neymar, on the other hand, was required to do almost nothing defensively, lurking up-field while his team-mates won the ball back.

This left Pablo Zabaleta free to attack down the right unchecked, and could have been costly if Argentina's forwards had been on their game.

TOTAL

Messi started the brighter, but after Brazil took the lead and space opened up for Neymar it was the younger man that stole the show.

Messi was the focal point for an Argentina side that, for all their possession, created few clear-cut chances, while Neymar typified the counter-attacking spirit that Dunga is trying to instill.

Neither man was quite at their brilliant best, but Neymar upstaged his more experienced club-mate.
