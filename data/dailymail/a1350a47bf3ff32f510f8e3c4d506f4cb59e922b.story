While Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham hobnobbed with Anna Wintour and Sir Philip Green at the London Coliseum last night, in Battersea, a very different awards ceremony was taking place.

As the winners of the annual British Curry Awards were announced, a small band of hardy celebrities, among them Lizzie Cundy and Nancy Dell'Olio, were in the audience.

And they had certainly dressed up for the occasion, with Dell'Olio, 53, opting for a dramatic Grecian-style column dress, while Cundy, 46, plumped for a frock that shimmered with sequins.

Also on the guest list was Keith Vaz MP, who, unlike the female attendees, chose to forgo sequins in favour of a neatly tailored suit.

But not everyone was so restrained. Folami Ankoanda-Thompson, a singer with 1970s band Chic, opted for a glittering number that could have come straight from a theatrical costume department.

Just as colourful was Home Secretary Theresa May, who joined the party in a turquoise shalwar kameez and a bright red pair of flat pumps.

The British Curry Awards have become something of an institution since being launched by businessman Enam Ali in 2005.

Dubbed Britain's 'Curry Oscars', they recognise the efforts of chefs and businessmen alike and recognise restaurateurs who have made a real difference to the UK's gastronomic scene.

Politicians, among them the Prime Minister and Boris Johnson, regularly attend the event, and the Queen sends a yearly message congratulating the winners on their culinary efforts.

This year's victors include Dartford's Polash Tandoori, which won the Best Takeaway award, and Mohammed Aslam MBE, who was handed the Special Recognition gong.

Speaking during the awards ceremony, founder Enam Ali said: 'Curry may have been born in India but now British curry has truly a place in the hearts and stomachs of people throughout the land. 

'It started in the early 60s with curry and chips. In those days it was the chips that broke down the barriers and Vindaloo or Tindaloo proved the masculinity of ‘real men’ before they washed it down with a few pints of lager.

'When we started the British Curry Awards in 2005 we were criticised for calling curry "British". 

'I am happy to take the blame for the changes in perception that have taken place since then because today British curry dishes such as Tikka Masala have an identity all of their own and are known and admired throughout the world.'

Eye-catching: Folami Ankoanda-Thompson stood out in sequins while Shobna Gulati was more low key
