The girlfriend of the 28-year-old New York City police officer who killed himself was on the phone with him seconds before he killed himself.

Maria Stuart says that she was trying to tell her fiancé Terrence Dean, who worked as a cop in Queens in the 111th precinct, to go get help because she felt he was suicidal.

'Fine, I'm going to kill myself,' he responded immediately before pointing his gun at his head and pulling the trigger.

Ms Stuart, 28, called her mentally unstable fiancé minutes after calling his precinct to leave an anonymous tip leaving a vague warning that one of the force’s officers was suicidal.

She didn’t mention Dean by name, instead asking hypothetical questions about what actions would be taken with an officer who was suicidal and whether or not he would lose his gun.

On Thursday around 10pm, Dean was responding to a car burglary and was still at the scene with his police partner and the two men whose car was robbed when he killed himself.

In the days leading up to the suicide, Dean had threatened to kill himself and those around him a number of times.

Ms Stuart said that part of the reason why he was depressed was because he felt that his family had pressured him into becoming a police officer instead of pursuing his dream of being a fire fighter.

On Wednesday, the day before he died, Dean threatened to kill himself by putting his gun in his mouth while at home with Ms Stuart.

That same day, he stormed out of the house after the couple had a fight because Ms Stuart had left her engagement ring at work. Dean stormed out of the house and shot the windows of his car.

His father, Avery Dean, came to the Queens house to meet with his son in the garage that afternoon, and while they were talking, the younger Dean threatened to kill himself again.

After these violent outbursts, Ms Stuart feared for her safety and the safety of her five-year-old daughter, which is why she called the police station Thursday to see if his gun would be taken away if he declared himself suicidal.

She was the last to speak to Dean before he killed himself, and insists that the couple was not fighting.

At the time he was responding to a complaint by 27-year-old Daniel Ben-Jacob who told the officers that someone had broken into his car and stole some PlayStation games and his radio, his brother Zeev told the Post.

While Dean’s partner was speaking with Mr Ben-Jacob, Dean himself was outside on his cell phone.

The Mr Ben-Jacob asked if Dean could dust for prints, which apparently annoyed Dean who responded by saying ‘Can’t you see I’m on the phone?’

Zeev said that Dean then pulled out his gun and pointed it at Daniel before turning it on himself.

'He puts the gun in his mouth and fires,' a police officer told the New York Daily News on Friday.

Those nearby thought the disturbance was merely a large garbage can, as residents of the affluent neighbourhood had never heard gunshots.

The officer who took Dean’s girlfriend’s warning call will not face any disciplinary proceedings, as they acted in accordance with NYPD rules.
