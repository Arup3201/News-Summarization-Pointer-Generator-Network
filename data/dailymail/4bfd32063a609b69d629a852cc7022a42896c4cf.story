Britons feel eight years younger than their age and say 'living life to the full' is the secret.

Remaining active is the best way to stave off old age according to two-thirds of people who took part in a new study.

Staying youthful is more important to women than men, with 40 per cent saying it is 'very important'.

Two-thirds of those surveyed found remaining active is the best way to stay youthful

Men do not believe old age starts until they are 81 - while for women it is a mere 70 years old.

Other factors to staying young include laughing, smiling and staying curious.

Psychologist Dr Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic told the Daily Express: 'Getting in touch with our inner youth is beneficial for our mindset.

'But it also creates physical reactions such as releasing endorphins and dopamine that create a sense of happiness and well-being.'

Researchers were also told that working late, commuting and not having time for hobbies or socialising contributed to looking older.

Laura Pope, from Evian, which sponsored the study, said: 'Age is a state of mind and an attitude to life.'

Despite having ever-green stars like Helen Mirren, left, and Judi Dench, right, Europeans voted Britain the most 'old at heart' country in the continent

But despite Brits Helen Mirren, 67, Dame Judi Dench, 78, and Dame Maggie Smith, 78, looking years younger than their age, a separate study found that the British were the most 'old at heart' nation in Europe.

Some 38 per cent of the 5,000 Europeans involved in the study said Britons were old before their time.

The UK was voted 'older' than Germany, Spain and Italy.
