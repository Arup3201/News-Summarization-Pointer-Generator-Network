A 10-year-old girl who made it her mission to raise awareness of childhood cancer after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year has died.

Gabriella Miller, who raised $275,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and even published a children's book about cancer, passed away at her home in Leesburg, Virginia on Sunday morning.

'It is with the heaviest of hearts and 
the greatest of love that we share the news that our daughter Gabriella 
passed away last night,' her parents, Mark and Ellyn Miller, said in a statement on their Facebook page. 'Thank you for loving our 
daughter and for all of your support.'

The little girl, who was diagnosed with brain cancer just before Thanksgiving last year, had began hospice care at home last week after a decline in her health and was unable to move or speak.

Inspiration: Gabriella Miller, who raised $275,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and began her own charity, has passed away. She was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year

'Gabriella was also angry 
that she was dying,' her mother wrote on Facebook. 'This was not fair & not ok. She had plans & 
goals for herself that she knew would never be realized.'

But she added: 'When I think 
about the last five days of Gabriella's life, I am astounded once again by my girl. Cancer 
took her over, took away her ability to walk, talk & move - with the
exception of her right arm, with which she communicated with us by 
signing - but G still had all her mental faculties.'

The family has donated her 
tumor to research and they will now live out Gabriella's final wishes
for them - such as visits to Disney World and using the word 'soda' 
instead of 'pop', they said.

Gabriella
had launched a letter-writing campaign last year that helped raise more
than $275,000 for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, after the charity helped 
realize her dream of going to Paris.

Accomplished: Gabriella, pictured left before her diagnosis, co-wrote a book, 'Beamer Learns About Cancer' with the author of the Beamer series, Cindy Chambers (pictured together right)

Determined to help other children 
have their last wishes granted as well, she wanted to spread her motto: 
'You might have a bad day today but there's always a bright star to look
forward to tomorrow. What's your bright star?'

The
family found out that the Foundation would receive a $1 million 
donation from Macy's if the company got a million letters for Santa 
Claus before Christmas.

The
Millers started a campaign called 'Make A Wish with Gabriella' and 
launched a Facebook page - and watched as tens of thousands of letters
began to arrive from all across the world, smashing her goal of getting
10,000 letters to Macy's.

Gabriella
delivered almost 241,000 letters to her local Macy's store before 
Christmas. In total, letters taken in by her or sent on her behalf 
reached more than 250,000.

Devoted: She made headlines last Christmas after launching a letter-writing campaign so Macy's would donate to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. More than 250,000 people sent letters (pictured)

Her efforts resulted in enough funding to pay for 36 more wishes to be granted to other children.

After the success of the campaign, she realized she wanted to step up her commitment to the cause.

Earlier this year, the family launched the Smashing Walnuts Foundation; doctors had initially told Gabriella her tumor was the size of a walnut so she and her family smashed walnuts with pans as a symbol of her fighting the cancer.

'I want to smash that walnut,' she told NBC4. 'That's the point of my foundation. Smashing out childhood brain cancer. I'm gonna keep fighting, I'm gonna keep smashing these walnuts 'til they're gone.'

Gabriella also became a published author after contributing to 'Beamer Learns About Cancer', a book featuring the popular character that aims to teach children about the illness.

Loved: Gabriella, with her parents and brother, later set up her own foundation and continued to speak out about childhood cancer. She was surrounded by her family when she passed away on Sunday

'I never thought I'd publish a book about
cancer,' she said. 'It was a dream come true to become an author. I just love 
writing more than anything in the world.'

She was also granted her wish of attending college by going to Shenandoah University, which gave her an honorary degree after she took a full day of classes earlier this year.

As she celebrated, she told NBC4: 'I'm at a Selena Gomez concert and she's one of my favorite singers and tomorrow I'm graduating college so I'm feeling pretty good.'

A public memorial service for Gabriella is being held on Wednesday at 6.30pm at Heritage High School in Leesburg.
