Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won a second term in a deep-blue Democratic state, a feat that he'll argue makes him the ideal GOP frontrunner for 2016

In a night that gave both sides of America's political gridiron something to carp about, Democrats seized whatever momentum was there to take and moderate Republicans finally saw a candidate that could help the party shake off the Tea Party influence.

Chris Christie won re-election handily in New Jersey, becoming the first Republican to win more than 50 per cent of the vote in a statewide election since George H.W. Bush did it in 1988.

But the incredible shrinking governor definitely isn't a tea party stalwart.

The closest facsimile of Sen. Ted Cruz running on a major GOP ballot Tuesday was Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. He lost the governor's race there to Terry McAuliffe, the former Bill Clinton fundraiser who hung a 'for rent' sign on the Lincoln Bedroom door and pulled in $34 million of his own for Tuesday's squeaker.

Cuccinelli raised just $20 million.

Republicans like Christie who have learned how to win in a heavily Democratic 'blue' state like New Jersey, can win anywhere – even in states where Democrats hold an organizing advantage.

That's a song Christie's camp will be singing from tomorrow through the 2016 GOP nominating convention.

If it takes the odd embrace of a Democratic president to make it happen, as Christie did after Superstorn Sandy, then so be it.

And Republicans like Cuccinelli, who bank on their states staying 'red' forever, will always be disappointed when real-world issues intervene.

Love her or hate her, Hillary Clinton is back. And it's Bill who's sowing political good will for her among key Democrats -- like old pal Terry McAuliffe -- whose support she'll need in 2016

Not enough: Republican Ken Cuccinelli lost the Virginia governor's race because he allowed himself to be pigeonholed as a far-right tea partier, something even the death spiral of Obamacare wasn't helpful enough to overcome

Virginia's demographic shifts since 2009 are astounding: White voters were 78 per cent of the state's voters in 2009, and are down to 72 per cent just four years later. The influx of black and Hispanic voters has given Democrats a reliable base and a hedge against Obamacare-like disasters.

Combined with a sharply growing federal government workforce in Virginia's northern counties – another group that votes Democrat by a generous majority – Virginia is no longer part of the reliably Republican deep South.

Neither is Florida, judging from the last two presidential elections.

If the GOP takes any so-called 'purple' state for granted in 2016, it's lights out and an Inaugural Ball for Madame President Hillary Clinton.

The ray of sunshine for Republicans comes from Washington, D.C., where President Obama's approval numbers are under 40 per cent for the first time. The wildly unpopular Affordable Care Act, along with scandals in Obama's justice, treasury, state and defense departments, have made campaigning with him a risky venture.

While that won't matter much in 2016, Obama's lame-duck year, it spells trouble for Democrats in 2014.

Past performance may not be indicative of future results: Liberal Democrat Bill de Blasio won the New York City mayor's race, but it's unwise to read broader implications into the outcome, just as Michael Bloomberg's tenure wasn't a sign of Republicanism run amok in the Big Apple

Virginia Democratic Governor-elect Terry McAuliffe won by freezing his opponent in tea-party carbonite and not letting him escape the imaginary ghetto of the far right wing. Democrats can keep doing that, and they'll keep winning

In Virginia on Tuesday, Cuccinelli managed to close an 11-point gap to just 2-1/2 percentage points, largely by harping on Obamacare.

His own right-wing credentials hurt him – half of Virginia voters told exit pollsters that he was 'too conservative' – but playing on Obama's negatives was almost enough to cut through that disadvantage.

Too soon? Sen. Ted Cruz, the tea party's biggest standard-bearer, is already scoping out Iowa and New Hampshire in advance of 2016, but his brand of quasi-libertarian politics may never catch on enough for him to win beyond Texas

So Republicans who can shake their images as social-issue tea party warriors will have a leg up in races that become referenda on Obama and his health insurance overhaul. In 2014, Obamacare will be the only show in town.

A large majority of voters in exit polls Tuesday said the economy remains their top concern, occupying their minds far more than health care, abortion, or any other hot-button issue.

It really is, still, 'the economy, stupid.'

In Colorado, for instance, a proposed $950 million income tax hike for education lost by a massive 66-34 margin despite backing from Gov. John Hickenlooper and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg – who put $1 million of his own money into the effort.

Republicans can keep winning, at least in local and district-wide races, by casting themselves in the role of superheroes fighting the evils of tax-and-spend liberalism. Similar messaging helped the GOP retain firm control of the Virginia General Assembly on Tuesday, despite losing the statewide governor's race.

As long as the GOP remembers that, it will keep control of the House of Representatives after the 20134 election.

But whether the House ends up vastly more Republican or only slightly so, the real game is in the U.S. Senate where Republicans hold 45 seats and are aching to reach 51.

Next year, 33 senators will face re-election, including 13 Republicans and 20 Democrats. Most models show the GOP picking up at least four of those, with three more rated as toss-ups.

All 20 of those Democrats voted to pass the Affordable Care Act.

Should both houses of Congress fall under Republican control, Barack Obama's last two years in office will be difficult ones. And if the Obamacare system is in mid-crumble by then, the Obama legacy-builing effort will be at a standstill.

Bromance: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie caught flak from his own party for chumming up with Barack Obama after Superstorm Sandy, but more than 60 per cent of the Democratic-majority state either liked him more or forgave him

Scratching that itch: Former President Bill Clinton has at least one more political season in him, and his popularity is far greater than President Obama's at the moment

Liberals won a key victory Tuesday in New York City, a progressive enclave that curiously had kept Democrats out of Gracie Mansion since 1993. But Hizzoner Bill de Blasio's new post is less of a sign of Democratic Party power than a course correction that was inevitable in a city that largely treats Republicans as a ghettoized minority.

In order to win anywhere else, Democrats will have to take a page from the Terry McAuliffe playbook: Raise ungodly sums of money, spend heavily on negative ads, isolate your opponent against women and minorities. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Small coattails: Barack Obama's ratings are in the tank, making his brand of help the one thing Democrats shouldn't rush out to vie for. He told supporters on Monday that he has one last campaign to fight -- and it's over his own flailing health care law, not anyone's electoral fortunes

Republicans, meanwhile, need to resolve the inner turmoil between the tea party and the moderate wing of Chris Christie-types who seem to be getting along with far less storm and stress.

Now that the Obamacare battles have been fought and the law seems to be withering on its own vine, the larger tea party movement will still have its place. But the more it becomes a central focus for the GOP, the easier it will be for Democrats to pick off its candidates, one by one.

Even in Alabama, a state tailor-made for flag-waving tea partiers, the more conservative candidate lost  Republican congressional primary on Tuesday night.

The Republican primary presented a classic clash between the two sides of the Republican Party. Bradley Byrne was the establishment, pro-business candidate. He ended up six points ahead of tea partier Dean Young.

It's one thing if the tea party can't win in New Jersey. But in Alabama?

It seems inevitable that Christie 
will end up staring down Sen. Ted Cruz for the Republican presidential 
nomination in less than three years, with the winner drawing Hillary 
Clinton for the main event.

The Grand Old Party will need to do some soul-searching before then.

Given his rapport with Democrats and independents, it's tough to argue Chris Christie isn't the Republican to beat in 2016

@highlight

The Clintons are already in 
favor-storing mode, helping their old fundraising wunderkind Terry 
McAuliffe win the Virginia governorship

@highlight

The poor showing in Virginia for the tea-party-backed Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli should worry the GOP's far-right wing

@highlight

Republicans can't afford to run many more candidates in 'purple' states who can be easily marginalized as conservative outliers

@highlight

Democrats can keep winning with the tested plan of hoovering up money and spending it on negative ads that motivate women and minorities

@highlight

President Obama's coattails are perilously short, and threaten to disappear entirely as his poll numbers plunge and his health care scheme falters
