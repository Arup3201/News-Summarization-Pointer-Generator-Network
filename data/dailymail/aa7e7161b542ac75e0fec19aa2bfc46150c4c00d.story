A man wearing thong underwear and a cape while riding his scooter in Wisconsin might be a strange sight, but he isn't breaking any laws, police say.

The 56-year old man who police identify only as 'Thong Cape Scooter Man,' was seen riding past an elementary school as young children were walking to a bus.

Clad only in a thong, black cape with red trim, and riding helmet, parents and teachers were shocked by the strange sight and immediately called 911.

The police sergeant went to the man's home to speak with him, police spokesman Joel DeSpain wrote in the official incident report.

The local exhibitionist was very cooperative and apologized to the officer. He admitted that he used poor judgment in his timing to ride by school, but that the incident was unintentional, DeSpain writes in his report.

The 56-year old had been just been traveling through the area and passed by the school on his way home from the mall.

However, spurred by the school's complaint the officer checked with the assistant City Attorney whether the man's actions were illegal.

'All three teachers were disturbed by his actions 
and felt that his behavior was highly inappropriate, given the timing of
 school ending,' the officer wrote in his official report.

The City Attorney reported back that there had been no violation of city laws and 'Thong Cape Scooter Man was free to ride on,' DeSpain quotes.
