A classic restored Ferrari has been transformed back to original owner Steve McQueen's personal spec - thanks to its Le Mans-winning owner.

The screen icon was the first owner of the 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 after he took delivery while on the set of Bullitt.

King of Cool McQueen was a huge fan of the coupe, which is regarded by many as one of the ultimate Ferraris, and held on to it until 1971.

He had the original silver car re-sprayed to red and fitted the wheels from his Ferrari NART Spyder, which he had previously crashed.

But a later owner decided to spend $10,000 controversially having it transformed from a coupe (Berlinetta) into a convertible (Spyder).

The result was a stunning conversion - but the Ferrari had lost the McQueen factor.

It was later resprayed yellow and then silver before it was bought in 2011 by Australian racing star Vern Schuppan.

Mr Schuppan, a McQueen fan who won Le Mans in 1983, decided to ‘bite the Bullitt' and have the car returned to the identical condition as when his Hollywood hero owned it.

He handed the car over to Ferrari and its Classiche department which certifies, restores and repairs special cars from the Italian marque.

Ferrari jumped at the chance to work on the McQueen 275 GTB/4, describing it as 'one of the more interesting cars ever to leave the factory'.

They reproduced the roof and buttresses with hand-beaten steel panels, before respraying the car from silver to the dark red which The Great Escape star had opted for.

Incredibly, the original rear deck, rear glass and chrome surround, internal rear pillars and other related pieces were reunited following its 1970s roof removal.

Marco Arrighi, director of Ferrari Classiche, said: 'Ferrari Classiche's ethos is to assist clients and collectors in ensuring that their car accurately reflects how it was when it left the factory.

'As only ten NART Spiders were ever built, as you can imagine, over the years a number of coupes have been converted into replicas, so the client's decision to restore the car to its original configuration was one we welcomed with open arms.'

After commissioning the restoration and making various trips back and forth from the factory, Vern was delighted with the results and loaned the Ferrari to its museum at the factory in Maranello, Italy.

He said: 'I have always wanted a Ferrari 275 GTB/4 and the McQueen ownership of this one certainly added to the appeal. Aesthetically I think it is one of the most beautiful Ferraris.

'In my opinion, the decision to convert it back was a no brainer, I don't think any car from the 1960s was quite as beautifully done as it.

'The finished conversion is outstanding and I couldn't praise the Ferrari Classiche centre more.'

Under the bonnet of the Ferrari 275 GTB/4 is a 3.3-litre V12 engine which develops 300bhp.

This gives the sleek sports car a 0-60mph time of around 6.5 seconds and a top speed of more than 160mph.

A Ferrari 275 GTB/4 with a Classiche certificate is typically worth around £1 to £1.5 million, but a world record £1.9 million was paid for a model at auction earlier this month.

Steve McQueen took delivery of the car when he was on the set of Bullitt, which was released in 1968

But adding the Steve McQueen factor helps sends values soaring. In 2011, the racing overall worn by McQueen in the 1971 film Le Mans sold for more than £600,000 at auction.

During the same year a Porsche 911 once owned by film star sold for £830,000 - more than 12 times its typical value.

But Vern, an Adelaide-based Aussie who spends a lot of time in the UK, is more than happy that Ferrari has seen fit to put the car on show in the new wing of Ferraris Museum which was recently inaugurated by Luca di Montezemolo where it currently resides today.

He added: 'At the moment it is in the Ferrari Museum and I am happy to leave it there.'

Ferrari has announced record profits - by deliberately selling fewer cars.

The Italian manufacturer delivered 6,922 cars in 2013, a reduction of around 5.4 per cent.

But the sales drop allows the firm to 'maintain exclusivity' by selling fewer models to customers who spend more on optional extras.

As a result, overall revenues were up five per cent to 2.3bn euros, with net profit of £246m euros, an increase of 5.4 per cent.

The UK market grew slightly with 677 cars delivered, setting a new record to become Europe's leading market, overtaking Germany.

With 2,035 deliveries, the USA was the largest market for Ferrari.

The policy of pushing optional extras is paying off, with 100 per cent of cars sold undergoing some sort of personalisation.

Options on Prancing Horse cars are notoriously expensive, with dustcaps costing £79 and little badges setting back owners £675.

And the firm's Tailor Made programme, where buyers can deck their vehicles out with denim seats and other odd materials, continues to grow.

Ferrari also confirmed its Classiche Programme was going from strength to strength. This part of the company deals with restoring and classifying cherished models such as Steve McQueen's Ferrari 275 GTB/4.

Luca di Montezemolo, Ferrari president, said: 'This is a very important result that comes as a direct consequence of the huge effort made by everyone.

'We wanted to maintain a high level of exclusivity, designing amazing products such as the LaFerrari, the 458 Speciale and the just launched California T, the result of significant investment in product and technological innovation.'

The LaFerrari is the Italian firm's fastest and most expensive road car ever. It is capable of 220mph and costs £1 million.

But despite its price-tag, the 499 planned were quickly sold with desperate punters rumoured to be willing to pay a £500,000 premium to own one.
