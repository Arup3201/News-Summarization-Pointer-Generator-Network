The Duchess of Cornwall has paid tribute to her ‘workaholic’ husband on his 65th birthday, revealing: ‘He’s not one for chilling.’

In an unprecedented interview during the couple’s official tour of India, Camilla also admitted that Prince Charles was ‘the most difficult person in the world to buy a present for’ – and that he was unlikely to celebrate becoming a pensioner unless she ‘hopped up and down singing happy birthday’.

Her revelations offer a charming insight into the couple’s relationship and a rarely glimpsed side of the future king, who is already the longest-serving heir in British history and today turns a pensioner.

The Duchess of Cornwall has paid tribute to her 'workaholic' husband on his 65th birthday. Her revelations, in an unprecedented interview, offer a charming insight into the couple's relationship

The Duchess, 66, was speaking after an engagement at the Aluva Palace in Kerala, south-west India, on Tuesday, where she met women who have been helped to start their own businesses.

But what should have been a brief exchange of words on the rain-sodden balcony turned into a lengthy chat as she spoke with undisguised warmth about her husband.

She said: ‘I will tell you that he is the most difficult person in the world to buy a present for. He is a man! They are hopeless! I spend ages trying to find something that is really wonderful and then [she mimes him opening a present] “Oh, thank you very much” [she uses a non-committal voice]. It is so annoying.

‘So he likes to make a list of things that he wants so you get it exactly right. I find this time of year impossible as it’s his birthday and then it’s Christmas, so you have got two in a row. Everybody else is easy but he is not.’

The Duchess did, however, manage to find the perfect present for the Prince. ‘He collects a lot of things and it is something special – china – that I have found,’ she added. ‘It’s what he really likes. And I know he will be happy with that.’

Asked whether Charles planned to celebrate or commiserate his big day, she smiled and said: ‘I think it is commiserate – well in my case I went very quiet about it. Luckily he has caught up with me now. We are both pensioners and he can join in with me collecting the bus pass.’

Although he likes birthdays – especially ‘cake and a bit of a sing song’ – the Duchess said it was difficult to get the Prince to take time out.

‘He never, ever stops working. He’s exhausting. No matter what the day, he is always working,’ she said of her husband, who guest-edited a special edition of Country Life magazine – featuring Camilla – to commemorate his birthday.

‘I am hopping up and down and saying, “Darling do you think we could have a bit of, you know, peace and quiet, enjoy ourselves together?”. But he always has to finish something. He is so in the zone … you are outside …  but he is always there in the zone, working, working, working.’

The couple have a string of engagements today in India and Sri Lanka, where Charles is due to open the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on behalf on the Queen for the first time.

The Duchess said they could wait until they are on the plane tomorrow to celebrate. ‘But he’ll stick with his papers, I know he will, while I am trying to sing happy birthday. I might just even have to hold up a sign saying “happy birthday, darling”,’ she laughed.

The couple took a day off from  their busy schedule yesterday at a luxury resort in Kerala. The Duchess said: ‘To be honest I think I am just going to chill out, completely, I don’t think I am going to do anything really.’

But asked whether she would persuade Charles to ‘chill out’, she laughed: ‘I doubt it, although I shall do my best. If there’s a little hint of sun I might just persuade him to go for a walk or sit outside. He loves walking, so that might do it.

‘We see the sun all the time but we never get the chance to just go and sit in it. So that would be bliss. So maybe I will persuade him. But no, my husband is not one for chilling.’
