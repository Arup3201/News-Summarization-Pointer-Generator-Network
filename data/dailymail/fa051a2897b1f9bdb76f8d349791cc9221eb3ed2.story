The parents of an 18-year-old boy who suffered a devastating brain haemorrhage while diving for cray fish have hailed his recovery a ‘miracle’ after doctors told them their son would not survive and set the wheels in motion for his organs to be donated.

Simon Phillips and his son Ben were out diving near their home at Geraldton’s Point Moore, WA, one Saturday morning when the experienced diver told his father he had a headache and was heading back to the boat.

‘I didn’t think too much of it because I thought it was shallow water blackout,’ Simon told Daily Mail Australia.

Doctors believed Ben Phillips, seen here in intensive care, had no chance of surviving bleeding on the brain

This photo of Ben was taken two days before his bleed out on 23 October  at his final school assembly where Ben was deputy head boy

‘We tend to get a bit of a head rush when we push ourselves too hard… but when two friends shouted out to say goodaye to Ben he said he had really bad headache and started vomiting over the boat.’

Simon had no idea that an Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) in Ben's brain which had been lying dormant since his birth had ruptured and caused life threatening bleeding.

He rushed his son to the emergency department at Geraldton Hospital on October 25, while Ben drifted in and out of consciousness.

‘I knew something was wrong but didn’t think it was to the point of death,’ Simon recalled.

‘While in the car, I was just talking to him saying “Ben you need to stay with me” but still not recognising the desperation of the situation.’

When they reached the hospital Ben was quickly given a CT scan which discovered the AVM in his head. An AVM is described as a tangle of blood vessels in the brain or on its surface which bypasses normal brain tissue and directly diverts blood from the arteries to the vein.

‘The bleed was so extensive they said the outcome wasn’t good… that became real to us and they asked whether we would be keen on donating Ben’s organs,’ Simon said.

During the rush to the hospital Simon called his wife Amanda and told her ‘you better get to the hospital’.

‘I just walked in and the look on the nurse’s face said it all. She said “come straight through on your own”,’ Amanda remembered.

‘They took me through the curtains and a nurse came to me and said “don’t panic but it’s confronting”. She opened the curtains and he was on life support right at that moment I still didn’t realise how serious it was, I just thought maybe he’d been hit on the head while coming up from the drive.’

Amanda recalls thinking ‘we were going to be late for his graduation dinner.’

‘He was going to be singing at the Year 12 dinner that night… I thought “what the heck is going on”… there was silence in the room with the doctors and nurses not saying much.

‘It just got worse, the feeling in the room got worse.’

Simon and his wife Amanda began praying and received a huge amount of support from their local and religious community and churches around the world.

‘The support has been tremendous; way beyond anything we expected it was crazy,’ Simon said.

The doctors told Amanda and Simon more scans had shown a massive bleed on the brain and a top neurosurgeon in Perth told them ‘there is no chance of survival’.

‘As a mum I felt like everything had all of a sudden drained form the top of me all the way to my feet. I felt faint and it just got worse.

This week Ben got back on his paddle board for the first time since October

Doctors hope that Ben will be back to full health within two years and able to surf and dive again within six months

‘The other doctor came in and said “I know it’s bad timing but we need to know if Ben would be happy to donate his organs”,’ Amanda said.

One of Amanda’s other two sons advised his mother that it was what Ben would have wanted and they began the process of moving him to Perth for his organs to be donated.

‘Ben and I got in the ambulance and about 30 people came to say goodbye, six of them very close friends, his grandparents and cousins. Everybody came because they were told to say goodbye… it was tough to see all the boys crying.’

An air ambulance flew Ben and Amanda to Perth where she held his hand the whole way and didn’t stop crying.

‘It was unbelievable and surreal and then I thought about his funeral, what he would like. I thought about his suit I had bought him. He had the school ball coming up, maybe he wouldn’t want to wear that to his funeral maybe he would want to wear boardies and a singlet?’ Amanda remembered.

‘I had to be there I couldn’t let him go on his own.’

It was when Ben reached Perth that the unimaginable happened.

Ben planned to perform at his school graduation before the freak incident

While a nurse did routine checks for any movement Ben miraculously responded.

‘She said “you might want to turn away now” and she pushed really hard on his chest. He responded quiet strongly so I heard her say “I’m sorry darling”,’ Amanda said.

Not long after that Simon and their middle son Zacc,19, arrived at the hospital, where their oldest son Kallan, 22, was too.

‘We were all in the room together, the five of us. The neurosurgeon came in and gave us a glimmer of hope as Ben had responded to the chest pain… he said “we’re willing to give it a go to try and save him”,’ Amanda said.

A tense seven hour operation with no guarantees followed and finally at around 3am the family got the call to say Ben had made it.

Ben's mother Amanda told of the amazing moment the neurosurgeon told the family that Ben had responded for the first time

‘It was then a good two weeks of up and down… it was a slow progress but it finally came, Ben responded to commands to squeeze the nurse’s hand.’

‘It’s a miracle, he’s Geraldton’s own Lazarus… it was very much Jesus saying "didn’t I tell you that I believed you would see the glory of God",’ Simon said.

Amazingly Ben has suffered no serious brain damage and doctors predict he will be fully recovered within two years with therapy.

‘I cried every day for three weeks. Every time I saw him it was heart wrenching… To think something like that can change in a moment. I’d just told him off about cleaning his room,’ Amanda said.

Four months on, Ben has returned to the ocean to paddle board and once he’s got the all-clear from doctors it’s hoped he will be able to drive and dive again within six months.

‘He’s very grateful for his life because there was a point when everything went down and he was in a dingy by himself. He thought “I’m going to die, this is the end”.

‘He is very much aware that his life has been spared for a reason for a purpose and he’s very grateful for his life and very thankful to God,’ Simon said of his son Ben.

The family said the traumatic experience has brought them closer together.
