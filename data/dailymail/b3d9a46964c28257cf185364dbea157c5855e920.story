Three schoolgirls were taken out of class after they shaved off half their hair to raise money for a cancer charity - even though teachers had sponsored them to do it.

The 12-year-old pupils were hauled in front of their head of year, who told them their fund-raising efforts were 'pathetic' and accused them of only being interested in their own popularity.

The mother of one of the girls accused the school of being 'ridiculous' and discouraging pupils from embarking on similar charity work in the future.

Kiera Thomas, Gemma Wright and Macey Daden decided to adopt the unusual hairstyles, with the breast cancer ribbon shaved onto the side of their heads, in order to battle cancer after losing loved ones to the disease.

They raised £800 for Cancer Research UK, with some of their teachers at St Leonards Academy in St Leonards on Sea, Sussex,  among the generous donors who sponsored the girls.

However, they were hauled before the head of Year Seven and told off for their appearance, while Kiera was put in isolation from her classmates because of her haircut.

The senior teacher told the girls, 'It is a pathetic way to raise money,' according to Gemma.

Kiera added: 'He said we did it to draw attention to ourselves and become more popular with the older kids.'

The girls asked teachers for permission 
to carry out the stunt, and were told that it was OK as long as they 
covered up the patterns which they shaved into their hair.

Kiera's mother Susan said: 'Kiera's hair is pretty much impossible to cover because of the way it was cut and also because it is so thin.

'Kiera was put into isolation on Monday from the rest of her class and told she couldn't go into any class until her hair was covered over. She came home in tears.

'They were told it was an "absolutely pathetic" way to raise money and that they should have gone on a jog instead. But some teachers sponsored them to have half their hair shaved off.

'A lot of people say the youth of today are selfish and self-centred. My daughter and her friends proved they're not. I think it was very brave, courageous and completely selfless of the girls to raise money.

'To make them feel so bad about doing something so worthwhile is pathetic and ridiculous. The way the school has handled this has been atrocious.'

Jenny Jones, principal of St Leonards Academy, said: 'While we applaud these girls for their efforts in raising money for charity, we have rules and regulations regarding dress and appearance which apply to all our students.'
