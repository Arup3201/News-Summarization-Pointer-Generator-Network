Driver: Samantha Pitcher, 28, has been spared jail killing a grandfather in a horror road crash - just seconds after she was distracted by a text message

A mother-of-three has been spared jail for killing a grandfather in a horror road crash - just seconds after she was distracted by a text message.

Samantha Pitcher, 28, crashed into partially-sighted David Wright, 74, and his wife Pauline as they crossed a road near their home in Lowestoft, Suffolk, with their son and grandchildren.

The elderly man died from horrific injuries, while his wife of 51 years was left seriously injured.

But now, Pitcher has walked free from court after being found guilty of causing Mr Wright's death by careless driving.

Pitcher, also from Lowestoft, was driving on the A12 on February 18 last year when she received a text message on her mobile phone, Ipswich Crown Court heard yesterday.

Meanwhile, Mr and Mrs Wright were crossing the road with their family after going for a meal at the Foxburrow Beefeater Grill.

Mr Wright was walking with a white reflective stick and holding on to his wife's arm when Pitcher crashed into them just nine seconds later, the court heard.

The couple's son, Howard, was walking ahead with his two children when he heard a 'short screech of tyres', followed by a 'massive crack'.

He turned round to see a scene of absolute horror - his mother was lying on the kerb, while his father was under Pitcher's car.

Mr Wright, who had lost most of his sight due to a genetic condition, died from devastating injuries following the crash at around 9pm.

Meanwhile, Mrs Wright was forced to spend three months in hospital undergoing treatment for multiple fractures and now has to use a walking frame.

At an earlier trial, Pitcher, who has three young children, pleaded not guilty to a charge of causing death by careless driving. However, she was later convicted by a jury.

Mr Wright, who was active in his local community, belonged to Gunton Park Residents' Association and Gunton Woodland Community project.

He was also a member of Lowestoft Live Arts group for the visually impaired.

Sentencing Pitcher to a two-year driving ban, Judge Rupert Overbury told her: 'It is of significance that nine seconds before the attack your mobile phone received a text message that was the last in a series of messages.

'I'm satisfied that the jury's verdict was on the inescapable conclusion that you were somehow distracted by that message.

'Although you didn't read it by picking it up you could scan the message across the screen very quickly as your telephone was positioned by the gear stick.'

He added: 'It is plain you were distracted by the telephone and your eyes moved off the road for a few seconds which unfortunately was long enough not to see Mr and Mrs Wright crossing the road.'

Jonathan Goodman, defending, said Pitcher was 'utterly remorseful' over her actions.

'From the moment she stepped out of the car her life, like the victims', has changed forever,' he said.

'She remains traumatised by her actions and the consequences of them. She sends her deepest condolences to the family.'

Speaking after the sentencing, Sergeant Bob Patterson, of Suffolk Police's Serious Collision Investigation Team, said: 'This was a tragic incident witnessed by Mr and Mrs Wright's son and grandchildren.

'Throughout the year we campaign and enforce against what we refer to as the "fatal four" - speeding, drink-driving, not wearing a seatbelt and using a mobile phone whilst driving.

'These four are considered responsible for many fatal collisions.'

He added: 'In this case we were able to provide evidence that Samantha Pitcher had received a text on her mobile phone around the time of the collision.

'Without providing any explanation as to why she collided with Mr and Mrs Wright, it is possible she may have been distracted and now has to live with these consequences.Â 

'Hopefully this sentencing will make others think again about the dangers of being potentially distracted by a mobile phone while driving.'

Pitcher was also handed an 18-month community order and sentenced to 240 hours' unpaid work.
