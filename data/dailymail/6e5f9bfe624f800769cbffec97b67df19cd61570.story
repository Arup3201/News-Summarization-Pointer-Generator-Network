A neo-Nazi linked to Norweigan mass killer Anders Behring Breivik has appeared in court charged with inciting racial hatred.

Kristian Vikernes was detained in central France last July on suspected terrorism charges.

He also faces other charges linked to alleged anti-Semitic and xenophobic messages.

Kristian Vikernes, a well-known black metal musician in Norway, was arrested with his French wife Marie Chachet at their home in Salon-la-Tour, in Corrèze, last year.

The 41-year-old, who is a convicted murderer from Norway, had in the past received a copy of a manifesto from Breivik, the far-right militant who killed 77 people in 2011.

France's Interior Minister Manuel Valls said in a statement at the time: 'Having received the manifesto before (Breivik) committed his crimes and having been sentenced in Norway in the past for murder, this individual, who was close to a neo-Nazi movement, was likely to prepare a large terrorist act.'

Breivik killed 77 people in a bombing in central Oslo and a shooting spree on a nearby island in July 2011. He was imprisoned in 2012 for a maximum term of 21 years.

Breivik's
 1,500-page manifesto outlined his planned crusade against Muslims, who 
he said were taking over Europe and could only be defeated through a 
violent civil war.

Cachet, 25, had a legal firearms permit when she bought the four rifles, the official said.

A trial has been set for October and he faces a maximum sentence of five years in jail

On his website, Vikernes discussed Breivik's manifesto, but in a post called 'War in Europe: Part V - Breivik Unveiled' he also criticises the murderer for killing more innocent Norwegians than Muslims.

Vikernes, a black metal musician and writer known as Varg, was convicted in 1994 of stabbing a rival musician to death in Oslo and burning down several churches.

He was released from jail in 2009 and moved to France with his wife and three children.

A trial has been set for October and he faces a maximum sentence of five years in jail plus a fine of 45,000 euros.

He has been charged with incitement to hatred and glorification of war crimes.
