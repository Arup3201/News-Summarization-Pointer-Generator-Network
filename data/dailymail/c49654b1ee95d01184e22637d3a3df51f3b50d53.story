David Cameron, leaving a meeting of the Cabinet in London, insisted he was 'passionate' about keeping Scotland in the Union

David Cameron has insisted he has no regrets about his handling of the Scottish referendum – as it emerged he will not be heading north of the border again before tomorrow’s crunch referendum.

The Prime Minister said he had no choice but to grant Alex Salmond a vote on independence, defended the ‘No’ campaign’s negative tactics and insisted it would not have been right to put a third ‘devo max’ option on the ballot paper giving Scots the chance to vote for more powers instead of outright independence.

Mr Cameron’s remarks came as polls last night put the pro-Union campaign just ahead of the Yes campaign with just a day of campaigning to go.

Despite the race for independence going down to the wire, Mr Cameron will not be visiting Scotland again before the polls open tomorrow.

But Mr Cameron, in an interview with the Times newspaper, insisted he was ‘passionate’ about keeping the Union together. Asked whether he had sleepless nights over the referendum, he said: ‘Of course.’

The PM also admitted it was his responsibility to convince voters to reject independence – despite only visiting Scotland a handful of times during the referendum debate.

He said: ‘I care passionately. My head, heart and soul will tell me that it would be a tragedy for the UK to break apart.

‘But I am a democrat, and I lead a democratic country, and when one of the nations of the UK voted for a government whose policy was to have a referendum, I had a choice.’

He said he ‘always thought this would be a tightly fought contest’ but added: ‘I’m not a pollster, so I can’t really explain polls. My job is to help move them rather than explain them.

The three polls released last night put the No campaign on 52 per cent, with 48 per cent backing Yes, after ‘don’t knows’ were excluded.

A poll by Survation for the Daily Mail showed a two-point narrowing of the lead since last Thursday.

Mr Cameron also admitted he was concerned about the ‘intimidation’ tactics used by the ‘Yes’ campaign, amid growing concerns over the behaviour of nationalist supporters.

‘There has been quite a lot of that going on, and that does worry me,’ he said.

Mr Cameron will be under intense pressure to resign as Prime Minister if Scotland votes to leave the UK tomorrow.

Tory backbencher Andrew Rosindell became the first to openly call for Mr Cameron to step aside in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote – but his view is privately supported by many of his parliamentary party colleagues.

He said: ‘I hope Scots vote to stay. If it goes wrong, however, the prime minister will have to decide what the honourable thing is to do.’

Mr Cameron is also facing increasing anger within his party over the cross-party agreement to hand more powers to Scotland while also protecting the funding agreement which hands more cash to Holyrood than England.

Influential Public Accounts Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin has called for Scottish MPs to be banned from voting on ‘English’ laws.

He also wants to see an ‘English First Minster’ and ‘English Chancellor’ separate from a British government ruling on ‘Union’ matters such as defence and foreign policy.

Mr Cameron admitted yesterday that the question of whether Scottish MPs should continue to vote on English issues would ‘get more pressing’ in the event of additional devolution for Scotland.

But the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown rejected English votes for English laws.

He said: ‘You’ve got to recognise the minorities of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, that’s why they’ve got parliaments and assemblies, that’s the key to to the UK constitution — it can evolve and meet the needs of people. England is still 85 per cent of the population and has 85 per cent of the membership of the House of Commons.’
