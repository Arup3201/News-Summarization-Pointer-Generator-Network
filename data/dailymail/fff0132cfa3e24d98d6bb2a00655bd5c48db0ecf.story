Aviation experts today reassured travellers that the A320 is still one of the safest planes in the world despite a crash in the French Alps which claimed 150 lives.

As emergency crews worked to retrieve wreckage from the site near Digne-les-Bains, in France, theories continued to circulate about what caused Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 to fall from the skies.

There has been some speculation about the track record of the model which experts were quick to quash. 

Paul Hayes, safety director at aviation consultancy Ascend, said: 'The A320 family has a very good safety record considering that there is a fleet of 6,000 aircraft out there.'

Safety experts said it was too early to speculate on the case of the crash, but noted that accidents during the cruise phase of the flight are rare, even though this comes less than three months after the AirAsia disaster.

'We have had a couple of events recently but in general jetliners don't crash during the cruise,' said Hayes.

Patrick Smith, an airline pilot and author of best-selling book Cockpit Confidential, allayed any fears the accident was purely down to the aircraft model.

'The A320 is a very sophisticated and popular model,' Smith told MailOnline Travel.

'I am not seeing anything in this accident that encourages me to think it is specific to that model. All Airbus models are designed similarly, and the A320 is the blueprint for other variations such as the A319 and the A321.

'I don't like the idea of blaming these accidents on specific models; this question is asked all the time, and all it does it leads to aircraft being compared with other aircraft.

'Crashes are so rare, and so comparing them considering the type of model is statistically hair-splitting.

'What you will also see is there is lots of discussion, and sadly lots of misunderstanding concerning how computers and how pilots 'fly' the plane.

'Usually in these cases, there isn't a single case, and it is a chain of events that can lead to something like this happening.'

According to separate surveys published last year by manufacturers Airbus and Boeing, only 10 to 12 per cent of fatal accidents take place when the aircraft is at cruise height.

The A320 is described as a 'workhorse' of the aerospace industry, transporting more than a million people a day from business travellers to backpackers.

The 150-seat medium-haul jet is one of the world's most intensively used, together with its main rival, the Boeing 737.

The Germanwings aircraft that crashed in the French Alps yesterday, killing all 150 people on board, was also flying on the industry's most widely-sold engines, made by French-US venture CFM.

More than 3,600 of the jets are in operation and another 3,700 are waiting to be built as Asia's economic expansion fuels record demand.

Put together with the rest of the A320 family of twin-engine, single-aisle jets - the A318, A319 and A321 - more than 6,000 are in use several times a day.

Experts say its safety record is among the industry's highest, but it made grim headlines in December when an A320 belonging to Air Asia plummeted into the Java Sea, killing all 162 people on board. The crash is still being investigated.

To airlines, the main value of the £65million ($97million) jet is reliability and quick turnarounds, the features it shares with the rival 737. But it made dramatic headlines in 2009 when a US Airways jet ditched safely in the Hudson River after a bird strike. 

Boeing statistics for its rival's best-selling model show that up to the end of 2013, there were 0.14 fatal A320 accidents per million departures where the plane was destroyed or written off.

The comparable versions of Boeing 737 had a rate of 0.11 per million departures, making them both among the industry's safest models compared with the industry average of 0.76, or more than 4.6 for the earliest days of the jet age.

At 24 years old, however, the A320 that crashed was at the upper end of the service life used by many first-tier airlines.

Jetliners are built to fly safely for considerably longer but most major airlines sell them sooner for economic reasons.

Patrick Smith added: 'Planes are built to last many years, so long as they are maintained in accordance with regulations, this shouldn't be an issue.

'There are airline specific procedures as planes age, and obviously the older they get the stricter the checks will get.' 

Jim Morris, partner in UK law firm Irwin Mitchell, added: 'There are many airliners out there older than this that are flying safely.'

Germanwings parent Lufthansa recently placed orders for over 100 new A320s.

To ordinary passengers, the A320 looks much like other jets.

But in the cockpit it represented a revolution when it began service in 1988 as the first 'fly-by-wire' jetliner relying on computers to fly within safe limits and replacing the usual control yoke with a side-stick, inspired by the F-16 fighter.

The increased reliance on computers, though increasingly common across the industry, prompted a bitter debate between Airbus and pilot unions over whether too much control was being taken out of human hands. The argument rumbles on to this day.
