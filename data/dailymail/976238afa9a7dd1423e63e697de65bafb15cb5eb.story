This is the moment a pensioner had to be rescued after 'deliberately' driving into the sea in front of tourists at millionaires' resort Sandbanks.

The woman sat motionlessly as the water poured into her Volkswagen Golf off the Dorset coast today.

Witnesses described how she wound down both front windows of her car before speeding down a ferry slipway and into the water at around midday.

The silver car was swept 100 yards out to sea by the fast tide the unnamed woman refused to move despite cries from the quayside to get out as it went down.

Rescue: This is the moment a woman had to be rescued after apparently driving deliberately into the sea off Sandbanks

Submerged: The VW sank  yards from the home of Premier League football manager Harry Redknapp on the Sandbanks peninsula

Rescue: The woman is led away to safety by RNLI and emergency workers after she was freed from the sinking car

Drama: The woman's car had to be dragged from the water shortly after she herself was pulled from the car

Lucky to be alive: The unnamed woman was rescued by fishermen who jumped into the sea and dragged her out

But the crew  of a passing fishing boat then dived into the water and pulled the woman free just moments before her vehicle sank.

The soaked casualty was lifted on board next to the Sandbanks to Studland chain ferry - which sits yards from the home of Premier League football manager Harry Redknapp. 

After being pulled to safety  her rescuers went back to the sinking vehicle to retrieve the woman's handbag.

Witness Steve Chater-Lea, 45, said the woman drove past a queue of cars waiting for the ferry before heading down the slope at speed.

He said: 'She drove past the ferry queue and accelerated down the ramp. It was definitely deliberate, you could tell from the way she revved the engine and the force with which she hit she the water.

'Both her windows were down and you could see her just sat there oblivious to people shouting out to her to get out. She made no movement or attempt to leave the car.

'There were 20 or 30 people stood on the quay about 15 feet away shouting for her to get out.

'There was a strong outgoing tide and the car went about 100 yards towards the sea, getting lower and lower in the water.

'A fishing boat came alongside the car but she still wouldn't get out and one of the crew dived in and pulled her out of the passenger side.

'She was alive and taken to the jetty for the Brownsea Island ferry and into an ambulance.'

Shock: Witnesses described how the motorists sped down this ferry ramp and crashed into the water

Fear: This picture was taken shortly after the car went into the sea and quickly it was swept 100 yards out

Witnesses: People on the busy ferry crossing the estuary also captured the moment the boat began to sink

Brave: Workers on a passing fishing vessel saw the woman and dived in to save her from the deep water

This barge with a lifting crane on arrived on the scene about an hour later and hoisted the sunken vehicle out of the water

Damage: The car's bumper and windscreen were both smashed  in the impact with the water

Holidaymaker Bob Smallman said: 'I saw the car in the water and we were all screaming for her to get out but she was just holding on to the steering wheel.

'A fishing boat went round to get her out but she didn't want to go, she looked frightened. They were dragging her in the water for a bit.

'They managed to get her out before the car went completely underwater.

'An inflatable boat that took her to safety then went back to the car and rescued her handbag before it sunk. She must have told them about her bag and been adamant they needed to get it.'

Witness Ash Naik said 'I was on the phone talking to my friend ad just said 'I have to go'.

'I saw her flying down the ferry jetty really fast. She jumped the queue of traffic and just shot off the end. She was going so fast one of her wipers came off.

'The car windows were open and the car started to sink when it hit the water but she just sat there and didn't move.

'Someone threw a life-ring in the water but she didn't try to get it. One guy jumped in but she was clung onto the door. They pulled her into the boat.'

The woman was taken to hospital where she was treated for shock and the effects of hyperthermia.

Busy: Numerous families with children on school half-term and other tourists were on the quayside and surrounding area when the woman drove in

Solent coastguard said they were called in and the woman and the car were both recovered safely

The roof of the submerged car could be seen a few inches beneath the surface of the water. A barge with a lifting crane on arrived on the scene about an hour later and hoisted the sunken vehicle out of the water.

Numerous families with children on school half-term were on the quayside and witnessed the incident at 11.58am today.

A spokesman for Solent coastguard said: 'A lady driving a Volkswagen car managed to go into the water off the slipway.

'She has been recovered safely. The car was located 30 metres offshore and collected by a local fishing vessel.

A spokesman for the Bournemouth-Swanage Motor Road and Ferry Company, which operates the chain ferry, confirmed the ferry had left the Sandbanks slipway and was halfway across the entrance to Poole Harbour at the time.

In 2005, a 30-year-old woman deliberately drowned herself by driving off the same slipway into the sea.

Helen Hogan lit a cigarette while she waited for her Rover 416 car to sink with her inside it.
