The time and date that aligned for a baby girl born in Montana on Saturday came close to making the event truly unique...if only it hadn't happened for another girl 1,500 miles away.

Quincy Kessler was born at St. Vincent Healthcare in Billings at 10:11 a.m. on 12/13/14 - a consecutive string of dates not to be seen again for many years to come.

Nearly a continent away in Cleveland, Ohio, Hazel Grace was born to Leisha Campbell and Shawn Zimmerman.

Leisha Campbell, right, rests with her newborn daughter, Hazel Grace, along with her husband, Shawn Zimmerman, left, and daughter Adalynn at Fairview Hospital in Cleveland on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2014. The seven-pound, 14-ounce baby was born at 10:11 a.m. on Dec. 13, 2014, or 12/13/14, the last sequential calendar date for at least 20 years

'We knew she was going to be born today [Saturday], we just didn't know it would be at 10:11 a.m.,' Campbell said in a statement as reported by ABC News. 'Everyone is telling us we should play the lottery. We feel this is a lucky day and are excited to get family photos with Santa.'

However, little Quincy did her best to pull ahead in this numbers game. 

Her birth weight, at 7.84 pounds, almost aligned with the other numbers. A fraction of an ounce more, and she would have weighed 7.89 pounds.

The baby is the second daughter born to Trenton and Melida Kessler.

Melida Kessler told The Billings Gazette that nurses in the hospital room noted around 10:05 a.m. that the 10:11 time might work out.

At that point, she says she started to push and Quincy came out at 10:11.

What a coincidence: Melida Kessler holds her daughters Sofia, 3, and newborn Quincy on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2014, at St. Vincent Healthcare in Billings. She too was born at 10:11 on Saturday

Quincy wasn't due until December 23, but the couple went to hospital on Saturday morning after contractions started.

Melida Kessler was dilated to 9 cm at 9 a.m., but then regressed to 7 cm.

'As we waited for it to go back up to 10, at around 10:05, the nurses said 'hey that 10:11 might work out,'' Melida said. 'So then we started pushing, and at 10:11 she came out.'

She held a sleeping Quincy, who has a mop of black hair, in one arm, and daughter Sofia, 3, in the other.

Asked if the numbers hold any significance, Trenton said no.

'It's just a fun coincidence,' he said.
