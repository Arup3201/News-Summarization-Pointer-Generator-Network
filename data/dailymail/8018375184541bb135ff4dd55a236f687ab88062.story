A sinkhole in Louisiana that is already the size of 20 football fields is eating up more of the Earth after the level surrounding it cracked for the second time in less than two months.

The 26 acre Bayou Corne sinkhole developed in August 2012, when a salt dome operated by Texas Brine Co. collapsed deep underground.

A levee was built soon after to keep the salty and sometimes oily water out of the surrounding freshwater swamps but it is now oval with growth zones heading northeast and southwest.

Muck: The water expanse is full of oil

In late October, the earth-and-limestone levee sank some and cracks developed.

The Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness director John Boudreaux said Monday that a new hairline crack was discovered Sunday in exactly the same spot as the largest crack, that stretched about a foot wide, from October.

The new crack had spread from a few feet on the levee top on Sunday to all the way across it by Monday, he said, adding that a second crack had formed along the inner side of the southern levee where the previous round of tremors had caused the levee to sink.

Boudreaux said its shape suggests a small section of levee top may slide into the sinkhole.

Since last week, micro-earthquakes have been increasing until around 180 per day were recorded near the sinkhole by Sunday. This has halted work to fight the growing water mass.

Louisiana state is suing Texas Brine as it tries to recoup $12 million spent in an attempt to deal with the sinkhole, including bringing in a team of scientists.

While no homes have yet been sucked in, officials warn that the gases being emitted could ignite, which would leave the Louisiana swamp looking like 'the gates of Hell'.

Boudreaux filmed the sinkhole in August, uploading the iPhone video to YouTube showing it burping and sucking in trees in the throes of a violent growth spurt.

'They're going down,' Boudreaux says on the viral video of a grove of cypress trees.

This week he spoke to Newsweek about the frightening expanse, which has largely emptied the town of Bayou Corne.

'How often do you see a tree go straight down?' he asked.

State officials guess the sinkhole will expand from its current size to at least 40 acres over the next several years. It's currently 750 feet deep in some points and has methane bubbling up from it.

The sinkhole is located in a stretch of about 100 miles between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that is not-so-affectionately known as Cancer Alley for its 150 or so petrochemical plants and high incidences of cancer among residents.

It is one of the most industrialized and polluted areas of the county, Newsweek reported.
