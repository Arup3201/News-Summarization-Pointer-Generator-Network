Luke Campbell became Great Britain's 28th Gold medalist tonight as he became the first boxer from these shores to claim top prize in the bantamweight category since 1908.

The battling boxer from Hull earned Team GB another gold and was in tears after a noisy Anglo-Irish tear-up.

Campbell, 24, overcame Ireland's John Joe Nevin who had to settle for silver in the 56kg bantamweight competition.

Home favourite Campbell was cheered on by a passionate local support - equally matched by followers of Irish traveller Nevin.

But
 it was the Union flags held highest after judges gave the decision 
14-11 to Campbell to the delight of the majority of the 10,000 sell-out 
crowd at the ExCel arena.

Campbell raised his hands in triumph - then burst into tears as the crowd chanted 'Campbell! Campbell!'

Speaking to the BBC afterwards he said: I'm lost for words, very emotional. It's something I've worked for all my life.

'I
 can't believe it. Nevin's a top fighter, it was a very difficult fight,
 very technical. It was just about outwitting each other.

'I had to be on my game to win and thankfully I was. I can't believe it. I'm very proud to be from Hull and I really appreciate all the support both there and here in London. Thanks.'

He left his mother shaking like a leaf after boxing his way to Olympic glory, Jill Campbell, 53, who told her little boy to 'find a safer sport' said: 'I was shaking from head to foot and I still am.

'At the moment it just feels amazing. To see him up there on the podium, it just felt so unreal, like it was happening to somebody else.'

Mrs Campbell said her husband Barney, 54, was unwell with a serious back problem so could not travel to watch his son win gold - but got a call from his wife as soon as their son triumphed.

'He said, 'I told you. I told you all, his day would come',' Mrs Campbell added.

'He has always believed in him, straight from the start he always said, 'Luke, one day, will be stood there with a gold medal'.'

Mrs Campbell, who has two other sons, Kane, 23 and Christopher, 32, and a daughter Kirsty, added: 'He's got such a talent. His whole presence, he's calm, collected and he thinks about things. He doesn't rush into anything.'

After saluting the cheering home fans Campbell left the ring to embrace girlfriend Lynsey Kraanen, the mother of his 18-month-old son Leo.

The couple are expecting another child as she is almost six months pregnant.

Ms Kraanen, 24, said: 'This morning I was really emotional and scared about him getting in the ring, then all of a sudden we all got this amazing confidence.

'We all feel on top of the world. We are going to have a really big party for him next Friday.'

The fighter's best friend Kenny Marsden, 27, from Hull, with tears in his eyes, added: 'This is like a dream come true, it's unbelievable.

'What people don't realise is he's worked so hard for it - all his life. It's not just training, it's 24/7 with him. He is totally dedicated and deserves this so much.'

He follows fellow Brit boxer Nicola Adams, who made history after becoming the first ever gold medalist in women's boxing.

As a chubby, angel-faced 13-year-old Luke Campbell decided he fancied having a go at boxing.

His family did not fight and he knew no boxers but as soon as he walked into his local boxing club in Hull with his brother Kane, the teenager was hooked.

Just two years later, Campbell was representing England on the international stage.

Campbell,
 24, is a family man through and through. He describes his mother, Jill,
 as his hero and is supported by his pregnant fiancee Lynsey Kraaen and 
their two-year-old son Leo.

'My
 real hero in life is my mum,' he told the Hull Daily Mail. 'She's like a
 real workhorse, she provides for the family, is always out working. 
That's where I get my determination from.'

Fighting back: Ireland's John Joe Nevin came back at Campbell but it was not enough to take the gold off the Brit

Winner: His win took Team GB's gold medal tally to 28 following Ed McKeever and Mo Farah in another great night

But he is equally dedicated to his 
sport, and says St Paul's Boxing Academy, where he got his first taste 
of boxing more than a decade ago, is like a second home.

He
 said: 'I don't know what drove me to the sport, it was just something I
 fancied doing. There was no influence in my family because no-one 
boxed. I didn't know any boxers. I went to the gym round the corner from
 my house with my brother and found out about St Paul's after the first 
season.

'I moved to St Paul's and have been here ever since. From the moment I walked through the front door it felt like home.'

He said the team at St Paul's did not just teach him about boxing but also gave him an education in life.

Victory: Campbell cannot contain his delight after his memorable victory, which saw Ireland claim silver

It was a lesson that has served him well.

Campbell became England's first European champion for 47 years in 2008.

He took the silver medal in last year's World Championships, ranking him number two in the world in the bantamweight division.

A hand injury stopped him fighting for 10
 months in 2009 but he was fully recovered by the following year, going 
23 bouts unbeaten and leading GB Boxing's Performance Director to 
describe him as the benchmark for the rest of the boxers in the squad.

Mike Bromby, Campbell's coach at St Paul's, says the boxer's success is down to hard work and dedication.

'He was 12 or 13 when he came to us. He's worked hard and he's got where he is now. He's come through, great dedication and discipline," he said.

'He's a great talent. It's fantastic for Hull, for Yorkshire and for the country.'

Bromby added: 'He's a great role model. I'm so proud.'
