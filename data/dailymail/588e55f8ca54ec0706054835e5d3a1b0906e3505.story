Lee Roberts, 34, of Leicester, East Midlands, pictured outside Leicester Crown Court, is accused of causing death by dangerous driving in September 2012

A van driver killed a motorcyclist when he lost control of his vehicle after scoffing five sandwiches at the wheel, a court heard.

Landscape gardener Lee Roberts ploughed into oncoming motorcyclist Clifford Marston, who died at the scene, a jury was told.

Roberts’ transit van also collided with two approaching cars, injuring an 80-year-old woman, who has been left paralysed.

The 34-year-old is said to have veered onto the wrong side of the road while eating his fifth sandwich in a journey of just two miles.

Roberts, of Leicester, East Midlands, denies causing the death by dangerous driving of Mr Marston, 66, on 14 September 2012.

Leicester Crown Court heard the tragedy happened at around 11am on the A6006 Asfordby Road in Leicester.

Minutes earlier Roberts had stopped to buy fuel and sandwiches - a ‘breakfast triple’ pack and a double pack of egg mayonnaise - at a Texaco garage.

At the crash scene, he is alleged to have told witnesses he choked on a sandwich and let go of the steering wheel while trying to unblock his airway.

However, he later said in a police interview he had finished eating before the accident, and claimed it was caused when he suddenly blacked out.

Jonathan Straw, prosecuting, said Roberts’ van veered onto the wrong side of the road and hit a Ford Focus, but did not injure the driver or passenger.

Mr Straw added: ‘It carried on and struck Mr Marston’s motorbike head-on, before colliding with a following Honda Civic.

‘The question is, why did his van move in that way?’

Mr Straw alleged that Roberts had consumed virtually all his five sandwiches during the 2.2 mile journey, as police later found only a corner of one in his van.

He added: ‘He told people at the accident he’d started choking on a sandwich and it caused him to lose control, veer and crash.

‘But later he said, no, he’d finished eating before he left Melton, but had had a tightening of the chest and an unforeseen fainting or blacking out, caused him to lose awareness and he lost control.

‘We say he wasn’t in proper control of his vehicle and wasn’t taking proper care, if he was combining the acts of driving and eating in that way.’

Yesterday, jurors watched a video of the route taken by Roberts.

It took a police driver around eight-and-a-half minutes to complete the journey between the petrol station and crash site.

The court was also shown footage taken in the back of a police car after the crash of Roberts being quizzed by one of the first officers on the scene.

He told PC Tom Pearson: ‘I had finished my sandwich. It was already swallowed.

‘But it felt like it had come back up for some reason. I could feel it stuck in my chest.

‘There was a loud pitch in my ears and my sight went completely black. My chest muscles tightened and I could not move my feet on the brakes. I could not do anything. There was a bang.’

Terry Hall, the driver of the Ford Focus which was struck first, said in a statement read to the jury: ‘All of a sudden I saw a van bearing down on to us, on our side of the road.’

He added: ‘It was completely out of the blue. It seemed to shoot across the road out of nowhere. I had no time to react. I heard a bang.

‘The van hit the rear of my vehicle. As I looked in the rear view mirror, I saw it plough into a gentleman on a motorbike behind.

‘The motorbike shot up into the air and the poor chap was thrown onto the grass verge.

‘I couldn’t believe what had just happened.’

Passers-by went to the assistance of Mr Marston, of Oakham, Rutland, but were unable to save him.

Roberts suffered minor injuries in the incident.

The trial continues.
