David Cameron must calm down about the European Union's demand for an extra £1.7billion, his new man in Brussels has warned.

Lord Hill, Britain's new European Commissioner, urged the Prime Minister to 'look at the facts' to cool the 'political temperature'.

Mr Cameron has warned the EU's  'appalling' behaviour has pushed Britain closer to leaving the EU, accusing bureaucrats of 'thumping' Britain with a bill which must be paid by December 1.

Brussels is to offer for Britain to pay the bill in instalments, something rejected by Number 10 today.

Lord Hill, Britain's new European Commissioner, urged the Prime Minister to 'look at the facts' to cool the 'political temperature' over the row about the shock £1.7billion bill

Britain is locked in intense negotiations with the European Commission about the demand for an extra £1,7billion, which caught Mr Cameron off guard at a summit last month.

The European Commission used rules dating back to 1995 and found Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels.

To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling. Bizarrely, Germany is also in line for a rebate while countries like Greece and Italy must pay more.

Mr Cameron angrily insisted he will not bow to the demands, declaring: 'I am not paying that bill on December 1. If people think I am, they have got another thing coming. It is not going to happen.'

But today Lord Hill, who was appointed by Mr Cameron in the summer, issued a plea for calm and insisted it was time to look for a 'practical' solution.

He added that the question over Britain's membership of the EU is at a 'lively stage' and is a 'boil that needs to be lanced.

Lord Hill, the EU commissioner for financial services, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It seems to me that this is one of those classic examples you get from time to time where something that a group of people think are technical matters suddenly, and in this case for perfectly understandable reasons, become highly political.

'The sensible thing now is to try to calm the situation down, and to look at the facts, and to look at a practical solution to the challenges that various member states face.'

He added: 'These things happen... the political temperature goes up and then it goes down again.' 

Lord Hill said his job means he is required to act in the interests of all 28 member states, not just Britain.

Britain faces by far the biggest surcharge and has been seeking allies among other EU states for a rethink of the contributions.

Chancellor George Osborne will use a meeting in Brussels tomorrow to call for a rethink, but is likely to face stiff resistance from states which gain, including France, which is in line for a billion euro (£788.7 million) rebate, and Germany, which stands to receive 779 million euro (£614 million).

One idea which has emerged is that officials in Brussels will allow Britain to pay the money in installments, without running up interest.

But Mr Cameron's offical spokesman said: 'The right thing is to keep doing what we have been doing, which is to make very clearly our views around the unacceptability of the scale of the bill and to get on with the work we are doing with the European Commission and other EU finance ministers.' 

Britain has been told to pay £1.7billion by December 1, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels

Lord Hill said Brussels needs to do a 'smaller number of bigger things better' instead of 'intruding' into areas of national life.

He told the programme: 'My view is that on the back of a reform process Britain would want to choose to stay in the EU.

'Obviously that's a choice for the people of Britain, there's democratic process to go through if we have that referendum. But I think it is good to address that question, I think there is a boil that needs to be lanced.'

He added: 'We have a tendency in Britain to think of all these issues as though they only affect Britain, British exceptionalism, if I can call it that.

'The fact is, when I sit here and look across the EU and what's happening in other countries, many other countries have very similar debates.' 

Prime Minister David Cameron has refused to pay the £1.7billion bill by December 1, accusing the EU of 'appalling' behaviour

Jean-Claude Juncker, the new Commission President, this week hit out the Prime Minister’s behaviour.

Mr Juncker criticised the leaders of Britain and Italy for making critical comments about the EU after both countries were landed with huge cash demands.

Matteo Renzi, the Italian premier, was also highly critical of EU civil servants after the meeting.

Speaking in the European Parliament yesterday, Mr Juncker said: 'I didn't like the way several prime ministers were behaving after the European Council.

'For a long period of time I've taken notes and I was always comparing what is said in the room and what is said outside the room. And from time to time it happens that the notes are not coinciding.'

Mr Cameron tried to block Mr Juncker, a former Luxembourg PM and arch-federalist, from taking the senior EU post.

Mr Juncker described the way Mr Cameron was presenting the EU cash demand issue as 'not correct'.

'They are presented in a totally different way in parts of British public opinion,' Mr Juncker said, pointing out that the rules of the EU should be better respected.

Mr Renzi had complained that the EU was overtly bureaucratic. At one point he warned that he would make public the cost of EU 'palaces' in a row over Italy's budget projections.

Mr Juncker responded: 'I have to tell my good friend Matteo Renzi that I am not the chairman of a gang of bureaucrats... I am the president of the European Commission which is a political body.'

David Cameron last night rejected an EU ‘pay-as-you-go’ compromise over Britain’s bill for £1.7billion.

At a dinner in Helsinki, he warned his northern European counterparts that the budget demand was pushing Britain towards the exit door.

It emerged last night that senior officials in Brussels are suggesting Britain could be allowed to pay its bill – calculated after the UK’s economy was uprated – in chunks over the next year, rather than in full on December 1. Interest payments of more than £40million a month would also be waived.

Last night, the Prime Minister argued the row was a ‘prime example of where the EU needs to respond to voters’ concerns’.

Mr Cameron said the £1.7billion demand had triggered a 10 per cent poll swing to leaving the EU ahead of his proposed referendum on membership should he win next year’s election.
