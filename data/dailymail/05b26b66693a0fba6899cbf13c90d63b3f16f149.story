A revolutionary restaurant has taken the phrase 'waste not, want not' to new levels and offers its guests a menu made entirely from 'waste' food.

Rub and Stub in Copenhagen, Demark, creates dishes using food which supermarkets and farmers would usually throw away and is run and operated entirely by volunteers.

Misshapen bananas, tomatoes which have a greeness to them and produce close to its best before date are some of the examples of the perfectly edible ingredients the restaurant use to make their meals- saving this food from being wasted.

Waste not, want not: The Rub and Stub restaurant creates dishes like this one out of food that is destined for the bin

Tore Heerup, from Rub and Stub, said: 'The idea originated from the experiences many of us have had with food waste - why should so much good food go to waste?

'The whole world is trying to save money and work more efficiently with every other aspect of life- why not food as well?'

The menu at Rub and Stub is planned on a day-by-day basis according to what surplus food has been donated that day, and is whipped up into fine cuisine by the head chef, ready to serve to the restaurant's 60 guests by the evening.

Tore said: 'Everyday we have to be creative and think about how we can put together the groceries we receive and how we can set an exciting menu for the evening.'

Quirky: The restaurant uses food close to its sell-by date or that farmers would throw away for being imperfect

Tasty: The menu is created on a daily basis to reflect what has been donated to the restaurant

Volunteers: The not-for-profit venture is staffed by 100 volunteers

Chef: The restaurant caters for 60 guests every evening and is hoping to build up a network of suppliers

The quirky restaurant has 100 volunteers who help manage the running of the kitchen, bar and service and there are only two members of employed staff, who are the chef and project manager.

The non-profit restaurant opened its doors to the festival goers of Copenhagen this summer and proved hugely popular but is still in the beginning stages.

Tore said: 'We are hoping to build up our network of suppliers, so we can offer more amazing food and also help cut down on food waste at the same time.'

Delicious: Food that is safe to eat, but close to its use by date, is dished up for hungry diners

Popular: The restaurant opened its doors in the summer for a music festival and was hugely popular

Daily menu: Dishes on offer change every day as the chef has to work with what has been donated

Guests: Diners eating at the Rub and Stub are saving the food from being wasted
