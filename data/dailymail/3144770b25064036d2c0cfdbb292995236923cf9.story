Martin Rainey, 39, needed 12 stitches in this gash above his eye after he was attacked in Bristol on his way home from his girlfriend's birthday party

A couple walking home from a birthday party were beaten unconscious after they chanced upon a gang of youths vandalising cars.

Martin Rainey, 39, and his girlfriend Helen Wild had been celebrating her 42nd birthday at a pub in Kingswood, Bristol, when they came across five young men kicking wing mirrors off cars.

These horrifying pictures show how badly Mr Rainey, a welder, was beaten - he needed 12 stitches to his face and doctors said he narrowly missed being blinded, while his girlfriend was barely able to speak for a week afterwards.

The thugs launched their unprovoked attack when Miss Wild, an office assistant, turned to look at one of the vandals, who were aged between 16-20,

She said: 'I just turned around and looked at them, or huffed at them.  Suddenly one of them threw a bottle, or a wing mirror, and it hit Martin right in the face, just above his eye.

'There was blood everywhere.'

The blow slashed open Mr Rainey's face and he was knocked unconscious, landing on the ground.  The young men then turned on his girlfriend.

Miss Wild said: 'I think they would have done something even if I had not looked at them.  Then I remember one of them saying "Leave it" to the horrible one and I was hit on the back of the head.

'I don't know if it was a fist or an object, but it knocked me out.'

Miss Wild fell in the street and believes she was then dragged onto the pavement during the assault, which occurred shortly after midnight on 26 October, because when she came round she had finger marks and bruises on her wrist and ankle.

She added: 'I thought they had taken Martin off 
and killed him because I couldn't see him anywhere.

'He had been knocked
out too and when he came round he did not realise I was on the floor, 
so he had legged it up the road after them.

'I ran to a house nearby, knocked on the door and they called the police.'

Knocked out: Both Mr Rainey and his girlfriend Helen Wild lost consciousness during the assault which took place in the early hours of the morning

The attack, which happened at around 
12.20am, was captured on CCTV but the streetlights had been turned off 
at 11.30pm in a cost-cutting move, meaning the footage is too dark to 
see.

The couple were taken 
to Bristol's Frenchay hospital where Miss Wild, who suffered from 
concussion, had a CT scan and her boyfriend had the gash above his eye 
stitched.

They both had to have a week off work and Helen is still suffering with neck pain three weeks later.

The
young men in the gang were aged between 16 and 20 and the main culprit 
is mixed race and of a 'very thin' build, while the others are thought 
to be white.

Avon
and Somerset police spokesman Martin Dunscombe said: 'Enquiries, 
including the examination of closed-circuit television, are being 
undertaken.

'We would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the assault, or knows any of the people involved.'
