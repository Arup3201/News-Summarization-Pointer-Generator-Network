As millions of Brits flock to the shops and spend hours - or sometimes minutes - labouring over the perfect gift for their loved one, it seems that their efforts may well be futile.

A new survey has revealed that nearly half of us are preparing to fake a positive reaction to an unwanted gift in order to avoid upsetting a loved one's feelings this Christmas.

From the 'long-suffering' to the 'faking it face', FEMAIL and body language expert Judi James are here to help you decipher the 12 telltale faces you could be witnessing on Christmas morning.

Not impressed: If your woman pulls the 'disappointed face' (left) she is not happy; while the 'long-suffering' face (right) says 'thanks for the socks...the same pair you've bought me for the past ten years'

Fuming: Only 0.4 per cent of people have witnessed the 'rage face' but it is the worst of the lot - and quite easy to spot

Judi showed over 2,000 
people photographs of the twelve faces and asked them to pick the 
ones they recognised most when giving gifts to friends and family.

The 'happy face' topped the list, with 64 per cent recognising it, followed by the 'love face' (37 per cent) and the 'curious face' (19 per cent).

Other popular faces were the 'OMG face', the 'disappointed face' and the 'fake it' face.

Win! Men, if your lady displays this 'happy face' it means she is delighted with her Christmas gift

What does her face say? The 'love face' (L), which is the second most popular face, means she adores her present, while the 'curious face' (R) means she is intrigued

Oh em gee! The 'OMG face' means she is shocked, but in a good way

The research found that, surprisingly, mum is the most likely person to be on the receiving end of the ‘fake’ smile, with nearly 1 in 5 people claiming she is responsible for the majority of unwanted Christmas gifts. 

Thankfully, amidst the faking, there will be genuine delight with almost two thirds of people claiming to see happy reactions from their gift giving efforts, and a third seeing a love face.

However, it seems there is a degree of awkward uncertainty among some gift recipients with one in five claiming to have witnessed a curious face as the reaction to their gift.

Judi explains: 'Being put on the spot to open a gift in front of friends and family can be a stressful situation, so it’s natural for people to ‘fake it’ in order not to hurt a loved one’s feelings.

Not convinced: The 'faking it' face (L) is one to look out for this year, and the 'styling it out face' (R) probably means she doesn't take your gift seriously

Behind the smile: The 'guilty face' (L) and the 'suspicious face' are two to look out for this year

'A lot of time and effort normally goes into buying Christmas gifts, so it’s probably the one time of year that a white lie is OK!'.

But how can you truly tell if someone is delighted or not? Judi maintains that it’s all in the smile.

'When it comes to knowing whether someone is truly happy with their gift look closely; the smile is usually spread evenly across the face, with a subtle display of upper and lower teeth and the eyes are narrowed slightly into a crescent shaped eye-smile.

'On the other hand, when we perform a white lie, we are often guilty of over-acting; look for over the top wide eyes and a wide open mouth displaying upper and lower teeth with a hand on the chest,' she advises.

So how do you ensure you don't get a ‘fake smile’? Men, take note. Here are the year's most unwanted Christmas gifts.

Topping the list is bubble bath (37 per cent), ill-fitting clothes (29 per cent), ornaments (27 per cent) and perfume or aftershave that smell awful (24 per cent).

Women are more likely to want to bin the bubble bath than men, with over a third (39 per cent) saying it’s the item they’d least like to receive, compared to only 18 per cent of men.

For men its socks that are the most undesired Christmas gift with 27 per cent listing this as the top no-go gift, compared to only 10 per cent of women, found the survey by American Express Gift Cards.
