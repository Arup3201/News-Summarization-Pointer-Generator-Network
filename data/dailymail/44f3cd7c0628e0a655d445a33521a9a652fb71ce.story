Police were called to Swansea City’s training ground after defender Chico Flores allegedly picked up a brick in a furious row with team-mate Garry Monk.

The incident happened on Friday when an altercation on the pitch between the two players escalated dramatically.

A member of the public — believed to be the mother of a youth-team player — phoned police after claiming to have spotted a screaming Flores brandishing the brick.

Officers took no action against the volatile Spaniard, leaving the matter in the club’s hands.

A statement from South Wales Police confirmed: ‘Police were called to the training ground at around 1.30pm on Friday 17 January. Club officials were spoken to and no police action was required.’

A Swansea spokesperson said: ‘Chico Flores and Garry Monk had an exchange of words, which is not uncommon between players in training grounds across the country, but no threats or altercations took place between the players in question.

‘It’s understood a member of the public phoned the police, who felt no action was required. The matter has been dealt with and is concluded.’ 

Low moment: Flores scored an own goal for Swansea in their 3-1 loss to Spurs on Sunday, just two days after the row with Monk

Selection decision: Swansea boss Michael Laudrup included Flores in his team to face Spurs on Sunday

It followed another incident earlier in the week when Flores is understood to have stormed out of a team meeting.

The  26-year-old centre back was still included in Michael Laudrup’s line-up at home to Tottenham on Sunday and scored an own goal in Swansea’s 3-1 defeat, a result that left them without a win in eight Barclays Premier League games and three points off the relegation zone.

Monk, 34, has made only one appearance for the club this season, in the Capital One Cup.

Concerns have been growing about the attitude of Swansea’s squad towards their eight Spanish players, with an ‘us and them’ culture developing.

The British players feel Flores, once a popular figure, has become egotistical and they are growing tired of his histrionics.

Flores quickly became known as a 
flamboyant character after moving to the Liberty Stadium from Genoa in a
 £2million deal in July 2012 following a spell on loan with Laudrup at 
Mallorca.

Character: Flores is known as a flamboyant character for Swansea

Flores is known to have a short fuse and his team-mates sometimes enjoy trying to provoke a reaction.

In recent weeks, Swansea have been running a crossbar competition with the worst-performing player forced to drive around in a pink Suzuki Vitara.

Under the rules of the competition, the car — labelled the Pink Ferrari — must be parked in the space designated for Flores’s red Ferrari at the Liberty Stadium.
