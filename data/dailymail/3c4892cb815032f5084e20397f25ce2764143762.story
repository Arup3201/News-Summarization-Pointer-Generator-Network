The problem of living in New York City is that everyone wants to come out and visit you. Even my agent (London's answer to Entourage's Ari Gold) came up with a excuse to come over and he rarely travels anywhere outside the M25.

So when you are trying to lead a quiet and clean-living life, there are constant temptations from random colleagues and friends coming over and you feel obliged to entertain them. They have just travelled 3,500 miles for heaven's sake.

Last week my ex-city colleague Max KW came over, and my friend and EDM singer Stacey Jackson was on her way back to the UK to play at Gay Pride, so we had a goodbye celebration at the Up and Down Club. We went along with Binky Felstead and Rosie Fortescue.

New York life: Jamie Laing, Oliver Proudlock, Stevie Johnson and Spencer attend their first Darty in NYC

The party must have been good, the day later someone told me the downstairs room is the best part of the venue. I wasn't even aware there was a downstairs although perhaps I should have worked it out from the name.

Later in the week Oliver Proudlock took us to a Darty in Brooklyn. A Darty is a Day Party at a club – we didn't make this up, it's a New York thing. It was at this amazingly cool club called Output in Brooklyn on a Saturday. Blazing sunshine, good tunes and great times.

Proudlock later broke from the group and met up with the Gillingham FC cheerleaders. I think the decent thing would have been to check in on Facebook and wait for us to locate him and the @GFCGems. But he didn't.

Jamie Laing and I are still trying to do us best to fight the inevitable decline of our bodies against this onslaught and he has taken to using MyCloudTag fitness app. It's the latest American app designed by top international fitness experts, an Antartica exploration team and the developers of Xbox Kinect.

The blurb on iTunes says, 'fun and effective workouts'. Jamie didn't look like he was having much fun, he looked pretty ruined afterwards but I suppose that's the point.

I've been joining him without the aid of an electronic fitness instructor but with the added boost from a couple of Forza T5 Super Strength supplements. To be fair the fat burner routines on the app are pretty good, and so we just about maintaining our physiques.

I am becoming slightly homesick now for one big reason. The British Grand Prix. It's coming up on Sunday 6th July and Race Week starts in earnest next Thursday with the GP ball at Royal Artillery Gardens in the City of London.

My old pal Jonny Dodge is running the event and last weekend he had the Lotus F1 Team racing one of their cars around Canary Wharf just for shits and giggles.

He works out: Jamie looks tired after his MyCloud Tag exercise regime

Wish I'd been there, I'd have given anything for a go in that car – it was the old 2013 V8 F1 car – loud as hell and very fast.

They
 were trying to raise awareness in a London road race like Monaco, and 
that would be something amazing. You can see it on the video here.

That's one thing that could never happen in NYC – there are no bends in the roads in Manhattan.

Lots of Love, Spencer.
