A new report into the shooting down of flight MH17 has concluded that the Russian military did supply separatists with a Buk missile launcher and their evidence also shows rebels were most likely to have been responsible for the atrocity.

An online report called the Bellingcat Investigation, which combines citizen journalist and social media accounts, used publicly available published and broadcast material plus eyewitness material, including satellite images.

'There is strong evidence indicating that the Russian military provided separatists in eastern Ukraine with the Buk missile launcher filmed and photographed in eastern Ukraine on July 17,' the on-line report states.

'There is undeniable evidence that separatists in Ukraine were in control of a Buk missile launcher on July 17th and transported it from Donetsk to Snizhne on a transporter.

'MH17: Source of the Separatists' Buk' was put together by the Bellingcat group using all publicly available material since the July tragedy in which 298 people on MH17 were killed

Bellingcat has been joining the dots and the dates. The same transporter with missile launcher is spotted on June 23 and then again July 19

'The Buk missile launcher was unloaded in Snizhne approximately three hours before the downing of MH17 and was later filmed minus one missile driving through separatist-controlled Luhansk.'

The report from the team, led by UK journalist Eliot Higgins, states that 'in the aftermath of the downing of MH17, photographs and videos were posted on social media sites claiming to show a Buk missile launcher in areas close to the MH17 crash site'.

'Using a variety of tools and techniques, the Bellingcat MH17 investigation team has been able to establish the exact location at which these images were recorded and the approximate time that many of the images were recorded.

'Based on this information, the investigation team has mapped the route of the Buk missile launcher through separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17th.'

The MH17 impact zone in the village of Hrabove, some 80 kilometres east of Donetsk. Dutch investigators gathered more human remains at the site in eastern Ukraine when they were allowed access once more on October 31

The authors said that 'our investigation was made possible by the examination of open source material overlooked by other organisations'.

It comes as Dutch investigators reported that more human remains at the MH17 crash site in Ukraine almost four months after the airliner was shot down over the war-torn country.

An official from separatist authorities in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, made the announcement but it's unclear if they were of passengers on the doomed flight or of combatants who died in fighting that has taken place in the same area.

The Malaysia Airlines flight from Amsterdam en-route to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine on July 17.

Russia has repeatedly denied the claim and pointed the finger at Kiev over the disaster. The Netherlands is leading the official probe into the downing of the Malaysia Airlines jet, in which all 298 on board, including 193 Dutch nationals and 38 Australians, were killed.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has admitted it's unlikely all the victims' remains will be recovered from the impact zone of flight MH17

Australia and the United States have accused Russian-backed rebels of shooting down Flight MH17 using a missile supplied by Moscow.

Bellingcat identifies markings on transporters as well as registration details throughout the chronological account.

'Based on the above information the Bellingcat MH17 investigation team concludes that at some point in late June, vehicles that were part of the June 23rd convoy from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade separated.

Using a variety of tools and techniques, the Bellingcat MH17 investigation team has been able to establish the exact location at which images of the missile launcher were recorded and the approximate time that many of the images were recorded. Based on this information, the investigation team has mapped the route of the Buk missile launcher through separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17th.

'Some of these vehicles returned to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade base in Kursk and joined the July 19th convoy from the base, while at least one other, a Buk missile loader, appears to have left the main convoy and towards the Ukrainian border, close to a separatist-held crossing.

'As yet, it has not been possible to establish when the June 23rd convoy returned to the 53rd Anti-aircraft Missile Brigade base in Kursk, or how many units were in the convoy.

'However, it is clear that at least one Buk missile launcher (3x2) from the June 23rd convoy was inside separatist-controlled territory on July 17th, and 3 days later a video was uploaded showing that the Buk system loader unit was very close to the Ukrainian border.

'Considering the established time frames, logical routes, and photographic evidence, it is possible that this Buk missile launcher was part of the same June 23rd convoy as “Buk 3x2” and supported it.

'In the opinion of the Bellingcat MH17 investigation team, the Buk missile launcher filmed and photographed travelling through separatist-held territory on July 17th is the same vehicle seen in the convoy travelling through Russia towards to the Ukrainian border in late June 2014.'

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte stated that the Netherlands-led investigation will do all in its power to retrieve all the remains but conceded that was it was now unlikely all victims would be recovered.

A Dutch Safety Board report into MH17 found, in September, that a 'large number of high-energy objects' penetrated its fuselage.

Prosecutors are still working establish exactly where the missile was fired from with a view to taking action against the perpetrators.
