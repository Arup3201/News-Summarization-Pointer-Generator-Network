Team news

Burnley

Sean Dyche expects striker Sam Vokes to once again be Burnley's only absentee when Manchester United visit Turf Moor.

Wales international Vokes has a long-term knee problem but was back doing some running on the grass at the Clarets' training ground this week.

Recall: Danny Ings (right) will retain his starting spot ahead of the visit of Manchester United to Turf Moor

Dyche will likely recall a number of players who were rested in the Capital One Cup defeat by Sheffield Wednesday in midweek, including goalkeeper Tom Heaton, long-serving defender Michael Duff and striker Danny Ings.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Ward, Duff, Shackell, Mee, Wallace, Marney, Ings, Kightly, Jones, Taylor, Sordell, Reid, Jutkiewicz, Gilks, Long, Barnes, Hewitt, Arfield.

Manchester United 

British record signing Angel Di Maria is fit to make his Manchester United debut in Saturday's game at Burnley.

Midfielders Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera (all ankle) are out, as is utility man Jesse Lingard, who has a knee injury.

Provisional squad: De Gea, Lindegaard, Amos, Rafael, Valencia, Evans, Jones, M Keane, Blackett, James, Fletcher, Cleverley, Anderson, Young, Mata, Di Maria, Januzaj, Van Persie, Rooney, Welbeck, Hernandez, Powell, W Keane.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Burnley’s only previous Premier League home game against Manchester United saw them win 1-0 thanks to a goal from Robbie Blake.

Manchester United have won five of their last six encounters with Burnley, keeping a clean sheet in each victory.

Manchester United have won only two of their last six Premier League games in August (D2 L2).

United have the lowest cross completion rate in the Premier League so far this season (5 per cent - excluding corners).

Angel Di Maria has assisted 11 goals in his last 11 league appearances.

Previous form: Robbie Blake's volley for Burnley sealed a famous 1-0 win over Manchester United in the sides' only previous Premier League Turf Moor meeting at the start of the 2009-10 season

Robin van Persie has failed to hit any sort of shot in each of his last two Premier League appearances – the first time that this has happening in his Man Utd career.

Burnley have played Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and now Manchester Utd in their last five Premier League games at Turf Moor.

Burnley have kept only three clean sheets in 40 Premier League games but one of them came at home to Manchester United in August 2009.

The Clarets are one of two teams (along with Barnsley) never to draw a Premier League game 0-0.

Of the seven ever-present teams in the Premier League, Manchester United have played in the lowest proportion of 0-0 draws (5.5 per cent).
