A generous rector handed out crisp £10 notes at his church service in the hope that parishioners would make a fortune to help with church repairs.

Richard Steel, rector at Kirkheaton Parish Church, near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire, put his hand in his own pocket to help with a final push to raise £73,000 to help renovate the church.

Taking his cue from the Parable of the Talents in the Bible, where Jesus tells the story of a man who entrusts money to his servants, Richard wants to see some creative ideas for a return on his investment.

Cash: Richard Steel, rector at Kirkheaton Parish Church, handed out £10 notes to his flock. He wants them to invest it and put the profit towards the renovation of the church

In the rather harsh parable - on the man's return he finds two of his servants had doubled the investment while the other, who rather missed the point, simply buried his money in the ground.

Richard said: 'I handed out around £450, it was mainly just the regular congregation, I don't think anybody came along just to get the ten pounds.

'I'm still not entirely sure what people will do with the money but I'm looking forward to hearing about all the great investments.

'We need to raise the money for work we need to do on the church. Already £375,000 has been raised and a further £73,000 is needed and I thought this would be a good time to try it out.'

Faith: Rector Richard Steel hands out the £10 notes to his parishioners to invest in the hope that parishioners will make a fortune to help with church repairs.

Parable: The rector has taken inspiration from the biblical tale where a man entrusts money to his servants

He added: 'Not everyone in the church has money to give so I thought I'd offer them some "seed capital" to invest, maybe in baking cakes for sale, buying car washing kit, material to make cards or a woolly hat to keep warm when offering a dog-walking service.

Charity: The money will be partially used to make the church a hub for the community

'I want all, from the oldest to the youngest to feel involved in this exciting project and hopefully do some good and have some fun while they are doing it.

'People have until Easter to put their idea into action and return with the profits.

'The parable does have a sting in the tail. The servant who didn't use the money wisely was "cast into the outer darkness".

'Jesus was encouraging people to fully use the gifts they had been given for God, not to waste them, but I promise that, even if they make a loss, I won't be doing that to anyone.'

The stunt is part of the final fundraising drive for a project which will see the church developed to make it more flexible for the wider community as well as church use.

This will include installing a new floor, new heating system, kitchen and toilets, office, as well as entailing a complete redecoration and replacing the pews with chairs.

Scaffolding is due to be put up this weekend at the church and from Easter Sunday church services will be held in Kirkheaton Primary School until the work is completed - probably in around six months' time.

The parable can be read at Matthew, Chapter 24:14-30.
