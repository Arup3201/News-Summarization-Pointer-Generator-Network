A dog in Illinois is being hailed a hero after coming to the rescue of a canine companion that fell the ice of a lake into the freezing waters below.

The desperate situation occurred in Andalusia as Water and Sewage Treatment were breaking for lunch.

Suddenly a dog came up to the group of men barking, running in circles and trying to get their attention.

That's when they realized a second dog had fallen into the nearby lake.

Hero: This dog was able to get the attention of Water and Sewerage Treatment plant workers and show them that another dog, Buck, had fallen through the ice of a nearby lake

Rescue: The men quickly got a boat and were able to pull the drowning dog out of the water

Safety: After the rescue, the hero dog ran away into the sunset, the men said

'The dog had been there a long time,' Matt Stark, a worker at the treatment plant, told ABC News.  

You could tell when we first got there it was howling like giving its last goodbyes or it was in pain, because we think it had been in the water about an hour.

'I told the guys we gotta hurry because the dog wasn’t holding its head up no more.'

The men called the emergency number, but quickly got to work trying to save the near-drowning dog, which has since been identified as Buck.

They pushed a boat up to the end of the ice and used a snare to drag the 10-year-old black Labrador out of the water.

'He just was shivering as can be,' Stark said. 

Saved: Buck is seen here shivering and cold after the incident. He was checked out by a vet

Snug: The men did what they can to warm Buck up after being in the freezing water 'for a while'

'I thought, ''Good for you, buddy, you’ll get another day to hunt''.'

Buck was taken to the Rock Island County Animal Care & Control where a veterinarian checked him out.

His owner has since come forward and said he was out hunting with a friend when their dogs became separated.

The hero dog, however, ran off into the sunset after the rescue.
