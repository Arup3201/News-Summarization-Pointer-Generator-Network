England will hope for great things from their two most experienced bowlers. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have 600 Test wickets between them — and 70 of those have come at Trent Bridge.

While Anderson has picked up 49 scalps in seven Nottingham Tests at 17 apiece — with six five-wicket hauls — Broad has managed 21 at 22 in five, including a  hat-trick against India in 2011.

Jimmy Anderson, who almost singlehandedly beat Australia here a year ago with 10 wickets in the match, needs five more to become the leading wicket-taker in Tests in England. He currently has 225, one behind Ian Botham and four behind Fred Trueman.

Expectation: James Anderson and Stuart Broad have to perform for England

42 Five Tests are being squeezed into 42 days — one of the shortest series ever.14 India haven’t won any of 14 away Tests since beating West Indies in Jamaica in June 2011.

Swing spells trouble

The Trent Bridge pitch has always been batsman-friendly — but it’s the notorious swing that can cause problems and undo teams. 

England’s past seven first-innings totals here have been a mixed bag: 229 v Sri Lanka in 2006, 198 v India in 2007, 364  v New Zealand in 2008, 354 v Pakistan in 2010, 221 v India in 2011, 428 v West Indies  in 2012 and 215 v Australia in 2013.Captain Cook

Alastair Cook may not see Trent Bridge as the place to kick-start his revival. In 13 Test innings he has scored only one half-century — against Australia last year — and averages just 21. That makes it his least favourite venue in England. His  next-lowest average is 37, at Headingley.

Under fire: Captain Cook must perform against India

Skippers: Cook with India captain MS Dhoni holding the series trophy

The opposition

Only two members of India’s likely starting XI have played Test cricket in England before: captain MS Dhoni (right), who played on the 2007 and 2011 tours, and fast bowler Ishant Sharma, who was part of the side that lost 4-0 here three years ago.

But Nottingham holds one happy memory. It was here in 2007, when Zaheer Khan was greeted by a handful of jelly beans, that they achieved one of only two Test victories in England since 1986. The other came at Headingley in 2002.
