A husband has relived the horrifying 
moments he battled to save his wife as she drowned in 'hellish' waters 
while swimming in the Canary Islands.

Nicola Bate, 48, was dragged out to 
sea after she went for a swim off Famara Beach, near the resort of 
Caleta de Famara in Lanzarote.

On hearing her screams, Anthony Bate, 
56, left his children at a beach bar, and dashed out into the sea in a 
desperate attempt to rescue her.

He grabbed hold of her, but started to struggle in the strong riptide.

As he fought for his life he was rescued by a lifeguard and pulled to shore, only to discover his wife had died.

An inquest in Clitheroe, Lancashire, was 
told the tragedy occurred last month after the Bates and their three 
children - India, 14, Nathaniel, 12, and Cameron, 10 - arrived at their 
holiday home on the island.

During the brief five minute hearing, 
Mr Bate of Barrow, Lancs said that the family arrived at the beach at 
about one o’clock and had lunch at a bar.

'The beach was packed but there was nobody in the sea. I didn’t see my wife enter the water.'

'When I looked around and saw her I turned to my daughter India and said “what is your mum doing out there?”'

An inquest heard that Mr Bate also fought for his life in the sea, but was rescued by a lifeguard and pulled to the shore. There, he discovered his wife had died.

The company director said he got into the water and reached his wife very quickly, but the conditions were 'hellish'.

'The sea was terrible. It was shocking. I’ve never seen anything like it.'

He said he managed to get his wife onto his back but they weren’t going anywhere.

'I remember thinking there are going to be three children seeing two bodies being brought out of the water.'

The lifeguard arrived and Mr Bate and his wife were pulled to the shore.

'I thought because she was only under water for such a short amount of time she would be ok.'

He said the lifeguards had tried tirelessly to revive his wife, but about 15 minutes later a policeman told him she had died.

'I asked if we could say goodbye and I asked them to cover her.'

He said he still cannot understand why she went in the water.

'We had been to the beach before. The
red flags fly all the time. It is a very dangerous beach. I cannot 
imagine why she went for a swim.'

It had been earlier reported that the
tragedy occurred after Mrs Bate had warned her two sons that the water 
was too dangerous after they wanted to go body-boarding.

Coroner Michael Singleton recorded a 
verdict of accidental death: 'Nicola Bate was overcome by water despite 
desperate attempts to save her.'

Mr Bate declined to comment after the hearing.

Nicola, who is originally from the village of Whalley in Lancashire was a housewife who also volunteered for the Home-Start charity.

The couple had met 20 years ago at an Asda store in Accrington and bonded over their mutual vegetarianism.

It had been reported earlier that the
tragedy occurred after Mrs Bate herself warned her two sons that the 
water was too dangerous after they wanted to go body-boarding.

'It was a little mistake with 
calamitous consequences and this is the tragedy we’re left with,' said 
Mr Bate. 'We are all devastated but we are being strong.'

Lanzarote, the easternmost of the Canary Islands, is one of the most popular destinations in Europe for British tourists.

Another British national died on the same beach in April after being pulled unconscious from the sea by fellow bathers.

The beach, on the island’s north coast, has become increasingly popular 
with surfers from around the world in recent years, according to local 
tourism websites.
