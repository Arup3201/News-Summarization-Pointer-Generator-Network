The student, originally from Chicago, is charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice.

Johnson's arrest has drawn wide attention because images of him with a bloody face spread quickly on social media.

He needed 10 stitches to close a gash on his head after last Wednesday's scuffle.

He has accused Alcoholic Beverage Control officers of racism. Johnson is African-American.

Supporters in Charlottesville General District Court were dressed in black in a show of unity.

The case was continued until May 28. 

Watkins made a brief statement to the media outside the courthouse after the hearing. The case has been continued as state police continued to investigate the March 18 arrest 

Johnson is due back in court on May 18. He faces charges of public intoxication and obstruction of justice

A video showing Johnson bleeding from his head while being held down by an officer in Charlottesville was shared widely online last week and provoked accusations of police brutality.

Johnson, a junior at the university, said through his attorney  after the incident that he was 'shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement three blocks from where I attend school' and would fight the charges.

'I trust that the scars on my face and head will heal but the trauma from what the Alcoholic Beverage Control officers did will stay with me forever,' his lawyer Daniel Watkins said.

The legal drinking age in Virginia is 21 years old and Johnson said that he was not intoxicated at the time. 

His lawyer has said he was simply standing on the sidewalk when officers approached him.
