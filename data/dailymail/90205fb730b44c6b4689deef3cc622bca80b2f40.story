Released: Anthony Marshall, seen here in his mug shot, has been given parole

The 89-year-old son of philanthropist Brooke Astor convicted of stealing millions of dollars from his mother recently said he has regrets about what happened.

A parole hearing document released Thursday shows that when Anthony Marshall was asked whether he'd do the things at issue differently if he could, Marshall said, simply, ‘Quite.’

Marshall's brief answers in the August 21 interview, which led to his release last week on medical parole, offer a glimpse into thoughts he didn't express at his 2009 trial or sentencing in a case that opened a well-placed window on New York society.

Interviewed in a hospital bed two months into his one-to-three-year sentence, Marshall was asked whether he had regrets about the events leading to his imprisonment.

‘Well, regrets, yeah,’ he said, ‘naturally.’

Astor married Vincent Astor, a descendant of one of America's first multimillionaires, and she gave away millions to both big cultural institutions and neighborhood charities.

She received the nation's top civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was a fondly regarded fixture in the city's society set. She was 105 when she died in 2007.

Marshall, a former ambassador and Broadway producer, was convicted in 2009 of exploiting his mother's dementia to loot her $200million fortune.

His trial plunged jurors into a world of Park Avenue apartments and sprawling estates; witnesses included Astor friends Henry Kissinger and Barbara Walters.

Mr Marshall, who didn't testify at his trial or speak at his sentencing, denies the allegations and has fought his conviction. He remained free on bail until June.

State law allows medical parole for inmates with serious and permanent illnesses.

Court date: Anthony Marshall arrived in court in June, helped by Charlene, as a Judge prepared to sentence him to prison

Marshall
suffers from Parkinson's disease, his doctors have said. He'd been 
taken to a hospital after falling down in prison and was interviewed 
with an oxygen tube to help his breathing, according to the redacted 
transcript released by the state Department of Corrections and Community
Supervision.

Mr 
Marshall told parole commissioners he can't stand up or walk for long, 
gets dizzy and needs help to fasten a button. While he said he was fuzzy
about the date and how long he'd been in prison, he said his memory 
overall was ‘fair.’

And when asked whether he recalled the allegations that led to his conviction, Marshall didn't hesitate.

‘I remember it,’ he said, ‘all too well.’

The New York Daily News reported that Marshall also told the panel that he ‘loved’ his mother and ‘found her to be an extraordinary person.’

‘We
had lots of things in common, particularly a sense of humor, and we 
went on lots of trips together,’ Marshall continued, singling out their 
frequent summer vacations in Italy.

When
asked by a parole board member what he would do if he were released 
early, Marshall said he would ‘enjoy the pleasure and surrounding of 
home,’ according to The New York Times.

He then added, ‘I miss home.’

The
New York parole board decided unanimously to free Marshall because he 
was 'suffering from a significant and permanent non-terminal condition, 
disease or syndrome'.

He has been at an disclosed hospital for at least a month, according to the New York Post, and cannot walk or use the bathroom by himself.

The
parole board also considered the $14.5million in restitution Marshall 
paid for stealing from his elderly mother to fund a Maine estate and 
55ft yacht among other luxuries.

Marshall,
who was given his discharge papers last Friday, will remain under 
the supervision of a New York parole officer until June 20, 2016, which 
is the latest possible date of his sentence.

The
89-year-old had been found guilty of stealing millions from his 
family's estate after his mother had Alzheimer's diagnosed in the years 
leading up to her death.

When his lawyers first filed for medical parole last month, a source told the New York Post: 
'Anthony is dying, and he is in a lousy state prison. He has a new 
doctor's letter stating he is even worse than a few months ago.

'He has very bad heart concerns. He is incontinent. It could be weeks or months or days.'

Distraught: Charlene Marshall seen leaving court in June after her 89-year-old husband was ordered to serve his sentence

When sentenced in June, Manhattan's Supreme Court Justice A Kirke Bartley said: 'I take no pleasure in following my duties', as he ordered Marshall to serve the minimum sentenced handed down to him in 2009.

Mr
Bartely said he would rather not jail the Second World War veteran, but
prosecutors argued that his state of health and war record should not 
mean an early release.

Marshall's
lawyer, William B. Zabel, said his client should be allowed to die in 
peace at his home with his wife Charlene by his side.

He had previously lost a series of requests to avoid prison because of his failing health.

Elizabeth Loewy, a prosecutor, said Marshall defrauded his mother 'because of his 'preoccupation for getting money for Charlene', according to the New York Times.

The
original trial was also told that Astor disliked her daughter-in-law 
and one of her nurses referred to Mrs Marshall as 'Miss Piggy'.

Her dislike for Mrs Marshall was allegedly shown in her will, when she left her two second-hand mink coats in a size 6, knowing she would never be able to wear them.

Sentencing: Anthony Marshall seen in court with his lawyers on sentencing day

At Marshall's sentencing, the judge 
read parts of a letter from one of his twin sons, Alec, urging the court
to spare him prison.

'Please
consider all the good that my father has done for this country ... My 
father once said, about the events that happened before the case, that, 'you
can't change the past', Justice Bartley quoted the letter as saying. He
urged Marshall to allow his son to get back in contact with him.

Marshall's twin sons from an earlier marriage, Alec and Phillip, had testified against their father in the 2009 trial.

And
it was Philip who brought the original guardianship case against his 
father in 2006, charging him of misusing Astor's funds, according to Vanity Fair. The civil case was settled but a criminal case quickly followed.

Prosecutors said Marshall, a former U.S. ambassador, exploited his mother's failing mind to loot her millions. After her Alzheimer's diagnosis, he bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money.

He also took valuable artwork off her
walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most 
of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite 
charities, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.

Astor had devoted her life to 
philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of money to the St Regis Hotel, 
the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Art Museum.

However,
the multimillionaire was left to spend her last days in allegedly 
heart-breaking conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue 
apartment while she napped in her own urine with no one to help.

She died in her 64-acre Holly Hill 
estate in New York, in August 2007. The estate, and her Park Avenue home
in Manhattan, were later sold.

When the wranglings over her $100million estate were settled in March last year, it was reported that Marshall was ordered to pick $74,680 worth of her possessions.

He chose a mixture of items, from a 
$30 wall bracket shaped like a tortoise to a $40,000 painting of a 
donkey by Giovanni Tiepolo, Vanity Fair said.

In
the settlement, the Metropolitan Museum agreed to a settlement of $3 
million for the Childe Hassam painting Flags Fifth Avenue, 1917, which 
had been bequeathed to the museum but sold by Mashall for $10million in
2002.

The Astor family 
made their money in the fur trade in the 1700s. Marshall's 
step-grandfather, John Jacob Astor, was the wealthiest passenger to die 
on the Titantic, where he was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top 
deck.
