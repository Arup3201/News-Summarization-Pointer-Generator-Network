Criticised: Emily Rose Eastop, 26, has set up a 'crowdfunding' page to help pay for her masters degree - but not not everyone's impressed

An Oxford graduate who set up a fundraising page asking donors to pay for her masters degree has been branded a 'posh brat'.

Emily-Rose Eastop, who calls herself a 'scientist, hula dancer, singer', has made £14,000 after turning to 'crowdfunding'.

But people have condemned the move as a 'shameful ploy' and she has been told to 'get a job like the rest of us'. 

The 26-year-old from South Woodford, London, thought she would be snapped up by employers after graduating with a 2.1 in Human Sciences from Magdalen College, Oxford, in 2010. 

But she has spent the last four years living off her mother and boyfriend and living in her family's large Victorian London home.

Miss Eastop has been accepted onto a MSc in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology - but with her £20,000 of undergraduate debt she says she can’t afford the £26,000 tuition fees.

In a bid to raise funds she has resorted to  setting up a fundraising page and has already attracted more than 200 financial backers. 

She runs an anti-pseudoscience Facebook page with 79,000 likes and has garnered support from leading scientists.

Harvard psychologist Prof Steven Pinker gave her £250, while another American professor of cognitive science pledged £500.

Her musician
 parents have also led to a generous £1,000 donation from conductor Sir 
Simon Rattle and an Austrian atheist who won the right to wear a pasta 
strainer on his head for his passport photo Niko Alm has also given £50.

But
 the move has been criticised online with one person commenting: 'You’re
 a posh brat who’s too used to getting what she wants - I know your 
type.' 

Hula dancer: Miss Eastop has been accepted onto a MSc in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology - but with her £20,000 of undergraduate debt she says she can’t afford the £26,000 fees

Getting there: She has raised £14,026 - just over half the amount she needs for tuition fees and living expenses

Another
 said: 'Why don’t you get a job like the rest of us and work to get 
enough money to go and get your degrees like I, and the rest of us have 
done.

'Such a shameful ploy for money is very reprehensible and not 
reputable for someone who calls themselves a scientist. Have they no 
shame in the UK?'

One
 condemned her for using crowdfunding to raise cash for herself, saying:
 'If you want grant money go ask people giving a grant. Crowdsourcing = 
how to be a bum in 2014. Go get a job.'

Crowdfunding is a new phenomenon, but has become one of the fastest ways of making money over the internet. 

It is used by businesses, charities or other ventures to mobilise an army of investors, who often each put in only small sums.

It can be a way for a people to obatin a share in a company but can also a way for people to donate to a cause anonymously.

The first major website to take advantage of the new fundraising trend was Kickstarter.

Set up in 2009, it allowed people to raise money for individual projects by setting up online accounts. 

For example, musician Amanda Palmer raised £700,000 from 24,883 backers in June 2012 to make a new album and art book.

American Hans Fex raised a similar amount from 5,030 backers in March 2014 for his 'Mini Museum' project.

In Detroit, a crowdfunding campaign is attempting to match people struggling with their bills with donors around the city. 

More than 1,500 donors had signed up on the website Turn on Detroit’s Water, which was created last week by Tiffani Ashley Bell and Kristy Tillman. 

Earlier this month, the owner of the Hard Rock Hotel Palm Springs announced that it had raised more than £880,000 in its first crowdfunding campaign.

She said: 'I think I entered the job market at the worst time because of the recession.

'I
 have been really open and put my heart on my sleeve. Some people may 
react negatively but people who actually get you will be very generous.

'If you do not want to donate then you do not have to. It is a gesture not a tax.

'I
 have had good connections to tap. I guess I am surprised that I have 
raised so much so quickly. Crowdfunding is going to get bigger and 
bigger.

She
 added: 'My parents are not millionaires. My mother was a successful 
musician and she was able to pay off her house, but as she got older is 
has become harder to get work.

'I am already so much in my mum's debt. I would rather not do the degree than have my mum pay for it.'

'The idea is that you do the masters with me. On the private blog I will summarise all the cruxes of what I learn and turn it into easily digestible lay person times.'

In a blog post in response to hateful comments, Miss Eastop wrote: 'I cannot fathom the mindset one would need to possess to translate this frustration into spiteful comments.'

'I could possibly take out a bank loan 'like the rest of us' (there are no student loans available for masters students), but it should be clear for all to see that this solution to my problem would be far inferior to being given a large number of small, voluntary donations from people in exchange for a look-in on my area of academic interest as I study it.'

So far she has raised £14,021 - just over half the cash she needs for tuition fees and living expenses.

Miss Eastop has a minimum target of £14,523 to reach by August 1, her deadline for accepting the offer, so she can pay her tuition and college fees up front.

A £1 donation gets you access to to her ‘exclusive master blog’.

Donors who give £500 or more get a professionally bound and signed copy of Emily-Rose’s prize-winning dissertation.

An Oxford University spokesman said: 'Fundraising for postgraduate scholarships is one of the University’s key priorities and this year over 1,000 fully-funded scholarships were available from the University, its colleges and supporters for new master’s and doctoral students in 2014-15, which puts us in a very fortunate position compared to our UK peers.

'But for the many aspiring graduate students who do not receive scholarships, it can be very difficult to find the money for their studies and we hope that more can be done at a national level to ensure postgraduate study is open to all.'
