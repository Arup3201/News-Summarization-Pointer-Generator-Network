Substitute Alvaro Morata was the hero for Juventus as his late goal took his side into the semi-final of the Coppa Italia at the expense of a stubborn Parma side.

The former Real Madrid striker was brought with just under 15 minutes left on the clock and was on target for the the sixth time this season with an 89th minute strike.

With Carlos Tevez rested, Juventus struggled to create chances for long stretches but became dangerous in the final 10 minutes, with Claudio Marchisio having had a shot deflected high three minutes before Morata's goal.

Juve will now go on to face either Roma or Fiorentina, who will battle it out for a semi-final place on Thursday.

With Lazio already through after a win against AC Milan on Tuesday night, the final place will be taken up by the winners of Napoli v Inter Milan on Wednesday evening.
