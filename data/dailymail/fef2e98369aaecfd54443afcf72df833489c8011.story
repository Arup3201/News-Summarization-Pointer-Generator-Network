A cyber attack that infected 550,000 Macs was ignored by Apple - who failed to communicate with the Russian anti-virus firm that spotted the infection.

Even customers were left in the dark as their machines became part of a 'botnet' of zombie machines which 
can be controlled by cyber criminals and 'told' to download new 
malicious software.

'We’ve given them all the data we have,' Boris Sharov of the security firm, Dr Web, which discovered the infection. 'We’ve heard nothing from them until this'

'Apple is developing software that will detect and remove the Flashback malware,' a member of the team said today.

The attack has afflicted machines in America and the UK worst, according to Russian security vendor Dr Web's statistics

'For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available,' says Apple.

Microsoft is much more open about such attacks - and usually quicker to respond, and to defend its customers.

The new attack was spotted by Russian anti-virus vendor Dr Web.

'We
conducted research to determine the scale of spreading of Trojan 
BackDoor.Flashback that infects computers running Mac OS X,' says the 
Russian antivirus vendor.

'The botnet encompasses more than 550 000 infected machines, most of which are located in the United States and Canada.

'This once again refutes claims by some experts that there are no cyber-threats to Mac OS X.'

Many
Mac users believe that the system is 'immune' to viruses and trojans - 
but in reality hackers rarely choose to write viruses that afflict Macs,
simply because there are relatively few Macs compared to the huge 
number of machines that run Windows.

Hackers want their attacks to spread rapidly, so they usually target the OS that offers the most potential 'victims'.

Describing the attack as a 'rude awakening' for Mac OS X users, blogger Adrian Sanabria said, 'Despite what Apple's marketing department would have you believe, Macs are not invulnerable to attacks and malware targeting OS X does exist.'

The attack works using a vulnerability in Java, and is delivered via infected web pages.

Just
visiting the web pages is enough to infect a machine, downloading a 
file which then downloads further malicious software from elsewhere.

Dr Web claims that more than four million web pages are infected with the trojan.

'Over 550 000 infected machines running Mac OS X have been a part of the botnet on April 4,' says Dr Web.

'These
only comprise a segment of the botnet set up by means of the particular
BackDoor.Flashback modification. Most infected computers reside in the 
United States (56.6%, or 303,449 infected hosts), Canada comes second 
(19.8%, or 106,379 infected computers), the third place is taken by the 
United Kingdom (12.8% or 68,577 cases of infection) and Australia with 
6.1% (32,527 infected hosts) is the fourth.'
