Hired! Justine Sacco has landed a new job six months after she was fired for a racist tweet

The
 PR executive who was fired last year after her racist Tweet sparked a 
revolt on social media has landed a new job - working for a revamped 
version of the app Hot or Not.

Before boarding a place to Cape Town on December 20 last night, Justine Sacco tweeted, 'Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!' - and promptly became public enemy no. 1.

While she flew to South Africa from the U.S., she was unaware that the tasteless tweet 
had been shared thousands of times and had even sparked memes and the hashtag 
#HasJustineLandedYet.

When she landed, she was promptly fired from her job at IAC, a media company that owns Match.com and Vimeo, and holed herself up in her family's home in South Africa.

But
 after admitting she was 'ashamed' for her attempt at a joke and 
deleting all of her social media accounts, she has now reemerged and landed a new job.

She
 will help with the promotion and relaunch of the app Hot or Not, 
which allows users to rate the appearance of other people who have 
uploaded their pictures, Buzzfeed reported.

This
 time around, the app, which is owned by British company Badoo will use 
location-based data to help you find the most attractive people nearby.

Offensive: She tweeted this racist message before boarding a plane from the U.S. to Cape Town last year

Realization: Sacco was snapped as she left the airport last year and learned about the anger against her

The new job comes after she lived in Ethiopia for a month carrying out volunteer consulting for a non-government organization.

After the debacle last year, she was pictured arriving in Cape Town airport looking shocked and talking on her phone - and moments later, her Twitter account vanished.

She later apologized in a statement released to The Star, a South African newspaper.

‘Words cannot express how sorry I am, and how necessary it is for me to apologize to the people of South Africa, who I have offended due to a needless and careless tweet,' she said.

‘There is an AIDS crisis taking place in this country, that we read about in America, but do not live with or face on a continuous basis. Unfortunately, it is terribly easy to be cavalier about an epidemic that one has never witnessed firsthand.

New job: She will now promote and help with the relaunch of the app Hot or Not, which allows users to rate the appearance of other people. The new version will also find attractive people nearby

‘For being insensitive to this crisis - which does not discriminate by race, gender or sexual orientation, but which terrifies us all uniformly - and to the millions of people living with the virus, I am ashamed.'

Before
 confirming they had fired her - and with Sacco still in mid-air - IAC 
released a statement condemning her behavior as 'outrageous and 
offensive'.

‘Unfortunately,
 the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight, but
 this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action,' a 
representative from IAC said.

The company later announced she had been dismissed.
