QPR forgotten man Adel Taarabt was all smiles as the west London side went through pre-season testing on Thursday.

The 25-year-old - who impressed on loan at AC Milan in the second half of last season - looked set to leave the club earlier this summer but with a move so far failing to materialise, the maverick playmaker could yet remain in W12 for the upcoming Premier League campaign.

Happy: Adel Taarabt looks quite content to be back training at QPR

Redknapp 
sent Taarabt home from the club's pre-season tour of Devon last summer, 
but with the former Tottenham manager yet to bolster his side in the 
close season, the Moroccan could well add a different dimension to his 
squad.

Despite
 not being active in the market so far, moves for Rio Ferdinand and 
Steven Caulker are reportedly close to being completed, with Redknapp
 also keen to add at least one striker to his ranks ahead of the new 
campaign

Aiming high: Matt Phillips is raring to go ahead of the new Premier League campaign

Prepared: Matt Phillips is aiming high ahead of the new season while Charlie Austin will look to continue his goalscoring exploits from last summer.

Nedum Onuoha, Matt Phillips and Charlie Austin were all pictured at QPR's training base in Harlington on Thursday morning, with the club's eyes now firmly focused on their opening fixture at home to Hull City next month.

Austin in particular will be relishing the opportunity to test himself at the highest level for the first time, being one of the few QPR players without Premier League experience.
