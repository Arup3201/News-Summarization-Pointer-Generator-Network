Firefighters are planning fresh strikes over the May Bank Holiday weekend as part of a long-running dispute over pensions.

Members of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) in England and Wales will walk out for five hours from noon on May 2, between 2pm and 2am on May 3, and then between 10am and 3pm on May 5.

There will also be a ban on voluntary overtime across England and Wales from 3pm on May 4 until noon on May 9.

In Scotland there will be a ban on voluntary overtime between noon on May 2 and noon on May 9.

Firefighters staged a series of strikes last year in protest at plans for a later retirement age and other changes to pensions, which they said do not take into account the unique nature of their occupation.

Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary, said: 'After three years of negotiations and an intense four months presenting an indisputable, evidence-based case for the need to ensure a pension scheme that takes account the unique occupation of firefighting, the Government is still burying its head in the sand.

'Several members of Government were only too keen to praise firefighters during the winter floods, but their words amount to nothing when they simultaneously ignore issues that threaten the future of firefighters and their families.

'Nevertheless, we remain totally committed to resolving the dispute through negotiation, and are ready to meet to consider a workable proposal as soon as possible.'

Matt Wrack, Fire Brigades Union General Secretary, said the government was ignoring issues which pose a threat to firefighters and their families

The last strike was on January 3, since when talks have been held in a bid to break the deadlock, while the union has met with the conciliation service Acas outlining its concerns and 'frustration' at the lack of progress.

The union wrote to the Government earlier this month setting a deadline of today for an improved offer.

The FBU executive unanimously decided to call more strikes. The union maintains that firefighters face the threat of being sacked 'merely for getting older', as well as having to pay increased pension contributions.

Union members voted by four to one last year in favour of strikes.

Fire Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'By calling unnecessary strike action, the FBU has shown it is not serious about finding a resolution to this dispute for its members and stands only to further damage firefighters' standing with the public.

'The Government has met with the FBU on many occasions, most recently during April, and has remained in ongoing communication to find a solution. Only yesterday, I wrote to the FBU saying proposals are still under consideration and stressed the importance of maintaining an open dialogue on this and other matters.

'The deal on the table gives firefighters one of the most generous pension schemes in all the public sector, and the proposals protect the earned rights of a higher proportion of members than any other public sector scheme.

'Nearly half will see no change and even firefighters who are not protected will see no change until 2015.

'Under the new scheme, a firefighter who earns £29,000 will still be able to retire after a full career aged 60, get a £19,000-a-year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state pension. An equivalent private pension pot would be worth over half a million pounds and require firefighters to contribute twice as much.'

London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: 'Today's announcement from the FBU for fresh strike action is regrettable. In London we will, of course, have contingency arrangements in place but just as before we will be asking people to take extra care to prevent fires from starting.

'We will be doing all we can to remind them to take care when cooking, to make sure cigarettes are disposed of properly and to check their smoke alarms are working, especially over the bank holiday period.

'During the strikes, 27 engines will be deployed at strategic locations across London and will be used to provide fire cover for the capital.

'The contingency fire service is provided by a contractor and is not intended to replicate the Brigade's normal operational cover arrangements. The contractor will provide basic firefighting and some rescue work.'
