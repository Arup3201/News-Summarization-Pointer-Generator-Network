A notorious criminal who gained the nickname 'Ratboy' for his habit of hiding in ventilation shafts as a child burglar is back behind bars after returning to his old ways.

Anthony Kennedy, now 34, made headlines nationwide as a baby-faced schoolboy who terrorised the Byker Wall estate in Newcastle in the 1990s.

He would raid homes and then escape police by crawling through heating ducts and stairwells while on the run from council care.

Locked up: Kennedy was jailed for three years at Newcastle Crown Court after admitting two burglaries in Blyth, Northumberland

Kennedy had his first police caution at the age of 10. By 13 he had committed 55 offences and run away from care 37 times.

In 2007, Kennedy claimed to have given up a life of crime after finding love and religion. He and his partner moved to Blyth, Northumberland, to have a fresh start.

He said at the time: 'I believe it’s important to treat others how you would like to be treated yourself and to have respect for other people.

'When I was Ratboy, those were things I didn’t care about.'

But yesterday Kennedy was back behind bars after he admitted committing two burglaries in Blyth in May this year.

He was sentenced to three years in jail at Newcastle Crown Court.

Promises: Kennedy had promised to change his ways (left, a mugshot from 2004) after finding love and religion and moving away from the Byker estate in 2007, right
