James Ward was left rueing a series of missed chances as he went out of the Australian Open after giving the seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco a first round scare.

The British No 2 outplayed Verdasco for spells  but could never quite drive home the advantage in going down 2-6, 6-0, 7-6, 6-3 in a shade under two and three quarter hours.

With Heather Watson and Kyle Edmund also falling, it meant that Andy Murray was left in isolation as the sole GB singles representative by the middle of the second afternoon at Melbourne Park.

Ward did enough to show the improvements he has been adding to his game, but at this rarefied level – the first time he has been in a Grand Slam main draw by right – there was a reminder that you have to take your opportunities when they come.

Covering the court well and often giving as good as he got in the rallies, the 27 year-old Londoner pounced on a slow start from the former top ten player and then had a break point in the opening game of the second set.

He recovered from the ensuing landslide to lead 4-2 in the third set, moving the powerful lefthander around to stop him teeing off with his renowned forehand too much.

But Ward, who knows Verdasco well from his days training in Spain, got pegged back from leading at 3-0 in the tiebreak. He forced a set point at 6-5 in the breaker but could only play a viciously kicking first serve long, then had an ace pumped past him before missing a backhand to concede the set.

While he is undoubtedly on the up, it is the playing of the biggest points that so often separates the accomplished rank-and-file from the likes of Verdasco, who has been a semi-finalist here.

In the fourth set the Spaniard got ahead immediately with a break and never let up from there. Defeat against a player ranked seventy places above him leaves Ward still only on the cusp of the world's top 100, a mark he hopes to breach in the next month.

Both players produced some high quality tennis, and it was to Ward's credit that he was so competitive, especially as he revealed afterwards that he has been coping with a family bereavement.

'It was a pretty good level and he said that to me afterwards. He produced at the big moments, but he's going away thinking that if he plays me again this year it won't be easy for him. I'm working hard and I'm stronger and fast than I've ever been.

'My grandmother passed away five days ago, I saw her over Christmas and it's been tough as we are a close family. I am going home for the funeral next week, at the moment that is the priority. I don't know what I will do the next couple of weeks but then I plan to play in Rotterdam and Dubai before the Davis Cup.'

Ward looks sure to be the second singles player behind Andy Murray for the World Group first round tie against the USA in Glasgow in early March. Murray returns to the Margaret Court Arena for his second round match against Marinko Matosevic that will take place in the early hours of the morning UK time.
