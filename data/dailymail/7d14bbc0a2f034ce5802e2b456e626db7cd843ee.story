Vladimir Putin and his top apparatchiks should face international justice over the annexation of Crimea, Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko demanded today.

Vowing to win back the Black Sea peninsula in future, Poroshenko alleged the rights of people in the annexed region had been repressed under Kremlin control.

His demands came as Kiev delayed a promised pullback of heavy weapons from the front line in eastern Ukraine, saying continuous attacks from rebel troops means they cannot safely withdraw.

Petro Poroshenko's demands came as Kiev delayed a promised pullback of heavy weapons from the front line in eastern Ukraine, saying continuous attacks from rebel troops means they cannot safely withdraw

Poroshenko used an address on the first anniversary of the start of the annexation to promise his country will regain control over the peninsula. 

'I am not going to say today that it will happen quickly and easily,' admitted the pro-Western president. 

'But it will definitely happen, we shall build together a new Crimea, where the rights and interests of the indigenous people of Crimea and all the inhabitants of the peninsula, regardless of their ethnic, language and religious background, will be guaranteed.' 

He went on to demand Putin faces international justice over the annexation of Crimea.

'The time will come, and anyone who has committed and will commit a crime against the Ukrainian state and human rights in Crimea, will face international and Ukrainian trials,' he said.

He wants Russian officials to stand trial in The Hague, said the Kiev media.

Despite pro-Russian rebels making new inroads in eastern Ukraine in the past month, Poroshenko claimed his country 'will never give up its sovereign rights to Crimea.' 

'Ukraine will defend by all available means the rights of people, who live there. There is a complete consensus on this issue,' said.

The annexation - which began one year ago - was a 'vile act carried out contrary to international law', he said.

With rebels massing near the strategic port of Mariupol, in violation of a ceasefire, Kiev refused to pull back its heavy weapons, claiming its forces were still be targeted by separatists.

'As Ukrainian positions are still being fired upon there can be no talk yet of a withdrawal of arms,' said military spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov .

Moscow denies giving military support to the rebels. But Russia made the same denials over Crimea before admitting that it had deployed troops.

If Mariupol falls to the pro-Russian rebels, it would remove a key obstacle to creating a separatist land corridor stretching from Russia's border with Ukraine to Crimea.

This morning military spokesman Lt. Col. Anatoliy Stelmakh told reporters that Ukraine will begin its delayed withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line in the east of the country only when rebel attacks entirely stop, in line with a cease-fire that was supposed to begin February 15.

Stelmakh said there were two rebel artillery attacks overnight and although this is significantly fewer than in previous days, 'as long as firing on Ukrainian military positions continues, it's not possible to talk about a pullback.'

Colonel Valentyn Fedichev, deputy commander of the military operation against the rebels, said there had been 27 attacks against Ukrainian forces over the past 24 hours, which he said was lower than in recent days. He also indicated that no pullback was imminent.

'If the enemies continue to use their own heavy weapons, it is clear that Ukraine will continue to counteract these operations,' he said.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's observer mission in Ukraine is supposed to be monitoring the weapons withdrawal. 

Its spokesman, Michael Bocuirkiw today said the monitors had seen heavy weapons movements by both sides but could not tell whether weapons were being pulled back or just being redeployed.

An Associated Press reporter today saw Ukrainian forces moving back from around the town of Debaltseve, which was captured last week by rebel forces after a fierce week-long siege.

Both Stelmakh and Fedichev said rebels are still trying to overrun a Ukrainian government position in the village of Shyrokyne, on the outskirts of the strategic port city of Mariupol.

Rebels began moving toward Mariupol last August, raising concerns they were seeking to seize the city in order to establish a land corridor between mainland Russia and the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula.

Russia has denied arming the rebels, a denial scoffed at by Western nations and NATO, who point to satellite pictures of Russian weapons in Ukraine.

German doctors have been allowed to visited Ukrainian military pilot Nadezhda Savchenko, who has been on hunger strike for more than two months in a Russian jail, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.

Savchenko, 33, was captured by pro-Russian forces and handed over eight months ago to Russia, where she was imprisoned on charges of aiding the killing of two Russian journalists in east Ukraine. At home, she has become a symbol of resistance to Russian aggression.

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to allow the humanitarian visit during talks on a ceasefire for eastern Ukraine in Minsk on Feb. 11-12, spokesman Martin Schaefer said.

Two German doctors visited her on February 15, then held talks with her prison doctors, in which Savchenko was included.

Savchenko is reported to have lost 37 lb since going on a water and glucose diet in December.

Schaefer told a regular government news conference that Germany was extremely concerned about her health, and repeated an appeal for her release.

He gave no further details of her condition, and said it was regrettable that reports had appeared in Russian media despite an agreement to maintain confidentiality.

Russia's Investigative Committee says the pilot provided the coordinates of two Russian journalists who were killed by a mortar attack in June in the Luhansk region of east Ukraine, held by pro-Russian rebels. She denies the accusation, but could be jailed for up to 20 years if found guilty.

Steinmeier is a member of the traditionally Russia-friendly Social Democrats and has long ties with Putin, although he has stuck closely to Chancellor Angela Merkel's tough line with Moscow over its backing of separatists in east Ukraine.
