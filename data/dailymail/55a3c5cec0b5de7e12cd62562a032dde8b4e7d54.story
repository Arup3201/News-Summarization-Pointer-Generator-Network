Australian teacher Robert Scott is fighting for life in hospital and has racked up more than $1 million in medical bills after suffering a fractured skull during an attack on a California residential street.

The 26-year-old and former champion rower from the NSW mid-north coast town of Pacific Palms has been in a coma and on life support for almost two months.

He was a PE teacher at several Tamworth high schools before flying to Canada to work at the resort town of Banff.

'The doctors don't know if he will recover,' Robert's father, Stephen, told AAP.

'He is lucky to be alive.

'They say he's young and could make some kind of a recovery and we're just staying positive and want our Rob back.'

Robert was flown on a Lear jet air ambulance from California to Sydney last week, where he remains in a coma and on life support in Royal North Shore Hospital.

The flight added to the already extremely high medical bills he accumulated in intensive care at Fresno's Saint Agnes Medical Centre, despite having travel insurance.

But the insurance company might not pay the bills because he was drunk when he was hit.

He had a blood alcohol level of .24, but the Scotts deny alcohol played a role in the attack. They are frustrated the alleged assailant and admitted associate of Fresno's Bulldog gang, Gilbert Romero, has not been charged.

The attack happened at about 9pm on August 17 in Fresno, a city 320 kilometres north of Los Angeles.

Local Gilbert Romero was arrested nine days later, but was released without charge.

Robert was walking with friend Helena Sordal along a Fresno street with an 18-pack of beer.

What happened next is in dispute.

Ms Sordal said Robert spoke to a woman who was sitting with a young child in a car double parked on the wrong side of the road.

Romero then allegedly ran from a nearby house and shouted, 'What are you doing to my girl?'.

'Robert had his hands down, backing away and said, 'I don't want any trouble',' Robert's father, recalling how Sordal described the incident, said.

'But the guy hit him.'

Romero, however, alleged Robert shouted an expletive at the woman and child and took a swing at Romero but missed. He said he punched Robert in self-defence. 

Lieutenant Mark Salazar of the Fresno Police Department's murder-robbery unit said his unit will re-submit the case to the DA later this week.

'We hope when we re-submit it something will happen with the case,' Lt Salazar told AAP on Tuesday. 

Lt Salazar said Scott had been drinking alcohol from 11am up until the confrontation, which complicated the case.

Scott's blood-alcohol reading was 0.24 and an officer who went to the scene said Sordal was so drunk they had to get her personal information from her passport because she was unable to tell them, according to police.

'What we do have is Robert was in the middle of the street, his friend Helena was carrying an 18-pack of beer, a car went around them and that contained Romero's girlfriend, his one-year-old son and his sister-in-law,' Lt Salazar said.

'The sister-in-law exited the car, went to the house where Gilbert Romero was in, as she was doing that she noticed Robert Scott yelling at Romero's girlfriend.

'She told Romero this, Romero went outside, he saw Robert Scott yelling obscenities at the girlfriend, his one-year-old son was crying and that's when he confronted Mr Scott.'

Romero's witnesses told police Scott had a beer can in his hand, threw a half punch and Romero hit him once.

However, Lt Salazar said the witnesses initially told police they did not know who Romero was.

'It is tough when there is no physical evidence, when you have one side and it's the suspect's side and they did lie initially,' Lt Salazar said.

In deciding not to charge Romero, the DA pointed to Romero possibly acting in self-defence and Scott's intoxication, Lt Salazar said.
