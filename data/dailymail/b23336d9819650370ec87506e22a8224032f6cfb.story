An estate agent has posted a property online - with pictures of what is thought to be a cannabis farm set up in a bedroom.

The two-bedroomed Victorian home in Bristol was put on the market for £130,000 after being raided by the police following a tip-off.

But a host of what seems to be drug-making paraphernalia was not removed before estate agency Besley Hill took promotional photographs for the sale and posted them on website Rightmove.

The second bedroom is strewn with plant pots, ventilation pipes, fans, cabling and soil over the floor.

Besley Hill swiftly removed the picture after it was spotted by an eagle-eyed house hunter and posted on social media sites.

The firm describes the terraced house in Easton, Bristol, as being 'in need of refurbishment'.

Its description reads: 'Victorian-style villa in need of refurbishment found on the cusp of Easton and Greenbank and comprising entrance hall, lounge, open-plan kitchen/dining room, with two bedrooms and first-floor bathroom.

'It boasts gas central heating, part double glazing a pleasant rear garden, and no onward chain.'

The original photos posted showed the exterior, bathroom, kitchen and garden - and the suspicious looking 'farm' in one of the bedrooms.

It was spotted by sharp-eyed would-be buyers and links were posted on Twitter and Facebook.Cory Kattenhorn wrote on Twitter: 'Things to find on @Rightmove a cannabis farm...'

Another potential buyer Rich Payne posted a link to the house and wrote: 'There appears to be a cannabis farm for sale on Rightmove.'

Avon and Somerset police said they had attended the house in July after reports of a cannabis factory.

They dismantled the equipment they found but did not make any arrests.

A spokesman said: 'On July 9 we had a call reporting a cannabis factory at a property in Washington Avenue.

'We attended to dismantle it. Nobody has been arrested in connection with this.

'When officers attend the site of a cannabis factory they take away the plants and any equipment that is needed for evidence.

The asking price for the Victorian terraced house in Washington Avenue is £130,000. It has two bedrooms and no onward chain but is 'in need of refurbishment'

'If anything remains in the property that could be used for further illegal drugs cultivation it is damaged beyond repair.'

A resident, who lived on the same road as the property but did not wish to be named, said: 'I saw a woman once in the whole time she was there, which was about four weeks.

'As soon as she moved in, net curtains were put up on all the windows.

'There used to be a funny smell in my kitchen and I could not work out what it was. Then one morning I got a call and was told the police were outside the house.'

She added, when shown a photo featuring the remnants of the apparent drugs factory: 'You are joking. What were they thinking?'

The manager of Besley Hill’s Easton branch declined to comment yesterday. Rightmove said the property had now been removed from the website.
