George Zimmerman allegedly confronted another driver during a road rage spat, during which he asked 'Do you know who I am?' and threatened to kill him.

Lake Mary police are investigating two reports involving the driver and 30-year-old Zimmerman, who was acquitted last year of a second-degree murder charge in the shooting of Trayvon Martin.

Police say that on Tuesday, Matthew Apperson, 35, was driving when he noticed a truck that 'stayed next to him, not accelerating or slowing' before he came to a traffic light.

Police released 911 calls from 
Apperson, in which he identifies Zimmerman as the driver and says he was 'threatening to kick my ass and shoot me,' and that 'he was gonna shoot me dead.'

According to a police report, Apperson later stated had seen the 'occupants were yelling at him'. When he lowered his window, Zimmerman said: 'I f**king kill you. Do you know who I am?'

Apperson: I was simply driving down Lake Mary Boulevard, left my work to get a cup of coffee, and I noticed a Honda Ridgeline on Lake Mary Boulevard that was going the same rate of speed as I, and rolled their window down.I then rolled my window down and there was a passenger going, 'Hey, what's your problem? Why are you shaking your finger?' I said 'Excuse me? I was in my car, rapping to myself with my windows up.' And I looked over and George Zimmerman was the driver. And they were threatening to kick my ass and shoot me.'Dispatcher: You know this was George Zimmerman?Apperson: Oh, for a fact! So I proceeded - I had no cell phone - so I proceeded to the nearest gas station where I could use the phone. He then came up in his Ridgeline - this will be on camera - towards my car, almost hit my car [unclear] said he was gonna shoot me dead.

Apperson said he drove to a nearby Circle K store and the truck had followed him. The police report states that as Matthew exited his vehicle, 'the gold pick-up truck drove toward him, and stopped and began yelling at him again.'

He went to the store and asked to use the phone to call the police.

Zimmerman was gone by the time officers arrived. When speaking with Apperson, the officer stated he 'observed a bulge in the front' of Apperson's pants, and asked if he was carrying a firearm.

Apperson produced a firearm and his concealed weapons permit, then placed the gun in the trunk of his car.

Two days later, the man called 911 again, saying he saw Zimmerman in his truck outside his office at W K White and Associates Inc, a company described on its website as social security disability specialists.

Apperson says he recognized the truck by a sticker on the back with the logo of Kel-Tec, a firearm manufacturer.

After spotting the truck, Apperson told police he saw it 'accelerate hearing the tires "chirp,"'

Police arrived as Zimmerman's truck was leaving and questioned him.

Zimmerman told the officers that he had just come out from an appointment at Waymont Court, the same development where W K White is located, and offered to show them a receipt as proof. After shaking hands with the officers, Zimmerman left.

Officer Bianca Gillett, spokesperson for the Lake Mary police department, told MailOnline, 'the officers on scene did not verify Mr. Zimmerman’s appointment, as they did not further the investigation since the victim did not wish to prosecute.'

Apperson: This is the location of the incident where this guy road raged on me, so apparently he's thinking I live or work around here, which is definitely the truth. It's really disheartening to see him lurking around here. Keller Williams Realty is the business. Dispatcher: For you? Or what he's parked in front of.Apperson: That's where he's backed in. He's backed in trying to hide, right at the Keller Williams Realty. As you first drive in to Waymont Court, the first set of buildings on the right.

'As of now, the incident is
closed. If the victim did wish to assist with prosecution, we could
reopen and review the incident at that time,' she added.

Apperson told MailOnline on Friday afternoon he did not want to comment on the incidents until he had spoken to his attorney. According to police, he declined to press charges.

After he was acquitted of second-degree 
murder following the shooting of Trayvon Martin, Zimmerman has had 
numerous incidents of trouble with law enforcement.

CNN reported
 that in September 2013, Zimmerman was detained but no charges were 
filed after his estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman, 26, called 911, saying
 her husband had threatened her and her father.

The couple was in the middle of divorce proceedings when Zimmerman confronted Shellie at their home. 

Zimmerman allegedly punched Shellie's 
father and smashed her iPad. In the 911 call, Shellie explains Zimmerman
 left the house but waited for her outside in his truck.

'He's
 in his car and he continually has his hand on his gun, and he's saying,
 'Step closer,' she tells the operator. 'He's just threatening all of us
 with his firearm.'

Let go: Zimmerman was allowed to go by police because Apperson said he did not want to press charges

Two
 months later, Zimmerman was in custody again, this time for aggravated 
assault with a weapon and two misdemeanors after his new girlfriend 
phoned 911 during an altercation.

According to USA Today, Zimmerman's girlfriend Samantha Scheibe, 27, ordered him out of the house, at which point he 'cocked the shotgun' and put it in a case with his AR-15 assault rifle.

As
 Scheibe began moving his belongings out, Zimmerman took the shotgun 
back out, pointed it at Scheibe and 'asked her if she really wanted to 
do that.'

Rage:
 George Zimmerman, 30, is accused of threatening to kill another 
motorist after an exchange where he asked 'Do you know who I am?'  

Scheibe later retracted her allegations and asked for charges to be dropped, saying, 'I believe that the police misinterpreted me and that I may have misspoken about certain facts that in my statement to police.'

Zimmerman phoned police afterwards to clarify the incident, claiming an argument had taken place over Scheibe's pregnancy.

Huffington Post later reported that Scheibe was not pregnant at the time.

Back in July, Gawker reported that Zimmerman was spotted in the parking lot of Pampano Pat's Motorcycles, which sells guns along with bikes.

Zimmerman told police he was 'helping protect the store for the owner,' but according to the owner, Pat Johnson, he hadn't hired Zimmerman, saying he 'has sat outside of his store several times on his own lately.'
