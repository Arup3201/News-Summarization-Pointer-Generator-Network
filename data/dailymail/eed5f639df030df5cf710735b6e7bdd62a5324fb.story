Network Rail sparked fury last night with plans for a £20million bonus package for six top executives just days after the company admitted it breached safety laws over the level crossing deaths of two schoolgirl friends.

The failing transport giant, which receives £4billion a year in public subsidies, claimed the ‘incentives’ would help it improve its performance, which was heavily criticised by regulators in December.

The deal will entitle the firm’s six executive directors to annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of their salaries.

They will also share in a long-term bonus pool worth up to £15.6million over the next three years. In total, the directors could enjoy total bonuses of almost £20million by 2015.

Network Rail this week admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, pictured, shortly before the huge bonus for Sir David Higgins was announced

The news came after Network Rail admitted three health and safety charges in relation to the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte 
Thompson, 13, who were hit by a high-speed train as they went Christmas 
shopping together in 2005.

The friends stepped on to the tracks 
while trying to catch their train at Elsenham in Essex but failed to 
spot another service travelling in the opposite direction.

The girls' fathers this week accused the transport giant of a high-level cover-up of damning reports that proved it knew of the dangers of the crossing.

Network Rail chief executive Sir David Higgins will qualify for an annual bonus of up £336,000 on top of his £560,000 ‘basic’ salary.

His share of the long-term bonus pool could be worth as much as £3.8million.

Transport
Secretary Justine Greening said the plans were ‘unacceptable’ and urged
directors to ‘exercise restraint’ but said she was unable to block the 
bonuses. Last night she was under mounting pressure from MPs on all 
sides to intervene.

It comes after RBS chief Stephen Hester decided to waive his £1m bonus earlier this week following mounting public and political pressure. 

Tory MP 
Anne Main, who led a Commons debate yesterday on Network Rail’s 
‘shambolic’ performance, described the proposals as a ‘disgrace’.

She
added: ‘If we are serious about being a Government that tackles fat cat
pay and bonuses in the public sector then the situation at Network Rail
has to come under scrutiny.’

Former
Labour rail minister Tom Harris yesterday tabled a Commons motion, 
signed by 27 other MPs from his party, calling on Sir David and the 
firm’s directors to turn down any bonuses.

And
Labour transport spokesman Maria Eagle accused Miss Greening of failing
to exercise her right to attend the company’s remuneration committee, 
which drew up the proposals. She added: ‘Passengers who have suffered 
fare rises of up to 13 per cent in January and deteriorating performance
on our railways will be staggered.’

David
Cameron’s official spokesman said reports of the size of Sir David’s 
proposed bonus were ‘speculative’, but added: ‘The Prime Minister has 
been very clear about his views on pay and bonuses and he has 
consistently said he wants to see responsibility and restraint.’

The spokesman said the issue was a matter for Miss Greening.

The
bonus deal is due to be rubber-stamped next week at a meeting of the 
company’s ‘members’ – an obscure body mostly made up of rail industry 
figures. The Government has just one seat on the 80-strong body.

Miss
Greening last night blamed Labour for a system that left the Government
‘no powers to block Network Rail executive pay and which in 2008 saw 
bonuses of over half a million given to the chief executive even when 
there were serious failures’.

She
added: ‘This is clearly a flawed system which we have already addressed
as part of our forthcoming Rail Review which will make Network Rail 
more accountable.’

Network 
Rail this week admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of 
Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13. They were hit by a 
train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at Elsenham station footpath 
crossing in Essex.

The firm last night insisted that ‘no decision’ had been taken on whether bonuses would be paid.

A
spokesman said the proposal for bonuses worth 60 per cent of salaries 
represented a major reduction on the 100 per cent bonuses paid in some 
previous years.

He said the new package was designed to ‘incentivise long-term performance’.
