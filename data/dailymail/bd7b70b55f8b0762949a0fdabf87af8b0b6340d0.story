Two passenger trains have collided in Thailand injuring more than 20 people and possibly causing fatalities.

Images of the twisted metal from the disaster in Ayutthaya province began to emerge on social media earlier today, amid police reports that one of the train drivers is in a critical condition.

Authorities still do not know what caused the wreck just north of the country's capital Bangkok but revealed that one train crashed into the back of another one.

A local police officer has said 22 people are believed to be injured, but that number is expected to grow.

Nateepat Thammaratsophon said most of the injuries were minor but the train's driver and a mechanic were in a critical condition.

Most of the passengers on board managed to climb out of the demolished carriages and left the site on another train provided by the state-owned railway company.

Images from the site show rescue workers climbing in and out of the mangled wreckage as they look for survivors. 

Mr Thammaratsophon said both trains departed Bangkok and were headed north when one rear-ended, adding: 'We are still investigation the cause of the collision.'

The accident was the latest to hit Thailand's transportation industry after a pick-up truck driver crashed his vehicle into a passing train on Friday.
