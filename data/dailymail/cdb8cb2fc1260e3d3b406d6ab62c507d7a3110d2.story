We all have memories of humiliating spots moments from our youth, but luckily for most of us, they won't have been captured on camera.

So spare a thought for Mark Armitage, a cricket player for Eastwood, whose very short innings has been filmed in slow motion.

Despite surviving just two balls the opening batsman is hit in the crotch and on the arm before finally dismissing himself as he falls over and knocks his own bales off.

Opening Eastwood batsman Mark Armitage had a humiliating game against Bradfield, surviving just one ball before dismissing himself on the second

After taking the first ball to his crotch the unfortunate batsman spins round before falling to the floor

The fielders for Bradfield can be seen laughing to themselves in the background as Armitage hits the dirt

As the video starts with the batsman at his crease it seems the unfortunate amateur made it onto the pitch without error, but got almost everything else wrong.

As the first delivery flies in Armitage swings at it, attempting to knock it away to his left-hand side, but completely misses and instead takes the impact to his groin.

To make matters worse the effort he put into the shot causes him to spin round before landing face down in the dirt.

After picking himself up Armitage has a go at a second ball which turns out to be even worse

As the ball rebounds off of his forearm the batsman completes a 180 degree turn in front of the camera

Howzzat: Just two balls into the game Armitage takes his own wicket after sprawling into the stumps

As the fielders for Bradfield laugh away, Armitage picks himself and what is left of his dignity up and prepares to face the second ball.

But that turns out to be an even bigger disaster that the first as he steps forward to meet it with the bat, but instead lands the ball on his forearm.

As the ball falls to the ground two feet away from him, Armitage flies backwards in a comical 180 degree turn.

Unfortunately for him he comes down backwards with his bat fully outstretched, hitting the stumps and knocking the bales clean off.

Despite the embarrassing turn of events the batsman was seen laughing while going off and even received a high-five from a teammate on his way to the showers.
