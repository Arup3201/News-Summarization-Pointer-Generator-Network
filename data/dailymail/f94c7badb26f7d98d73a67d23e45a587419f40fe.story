Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes

David Moyes will be sacked by Manchester United after the owners, the Glazer family, finally lost patience with the club’s dismal season.

United are confident of landing Holland coach Louis van Gaal as his replacement once they have tied up details of their manager’s severance.

The Barclays Premier League champions have already made contact with the Dutchman and he wants to join United after the World Cup.

The Old Trafford board planned to sack 
Moyes — just a year into a six-year contract — at the end of the season 
but will now bring forward that announcement after news of their 
intentions was reported by MailOnline on Monday afternoon.

End of the line: David Moyes will be sacked by Manchester United and could leave before the end of the season

Under pressure: United crashed to a 2-0 defeat at Moyes's former club Everton on Sunday, their 11th defeat of the Premier League season

Searching for inspiration: Moyes has found it impossible to maintain the high standards set by predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson

Bright beginnings: Moyes started work at Old Trafford on July 1 last summer, having been announced as Ferguson's replacement in May

Moyes, on a day off on Monday, had still not been contacted by the club on Monday night and is understood to be hurt and angry after learning of his fate on newspaper websites.

He will attend trainingat Carrington today but may well not survive the week.

Player-coach Ryan Giggs is lined up to replace him until the end of the season, alongside fellow Treble winner Nicky Butt, as United try to salvage some pride by finishing in the Europa League places at least.

Sir Alex Ferguson, who appointed Moyes, is expected to have little or no say in who the next manager will be.

News of the 50-year-old’s imminent departure broke on Monday in the wake of Sunday’s defeat at his old club Everton. However, it is understood the club decided to look for alternatives after the 2-0 reverse in the Champions League at Olympiacos in February.

The Glazers, who are due in Manchester next week, had been supportive of Moyes but have sensed since the turn of the year that results and performances were getting worse and that some of United’s senior stars had simply stopped playing for their manager.

They want to appoint a new manager — preferably Van Gaal — as soon as possible so they can tie up deals for players including

Southampton’s Luke Shaw before the World Cup. United know that it will be hard enough to attract players this summer without Champions League football and didn’t want to continue the negotiating process with a manager who had become a lame duck.

Certainly not many United players will be disappointed to hear the news. Even those who like Moyes realised that things were not working, an impression that hardened when the Scot walked into the dressing room at Goodison Park on Sunday afternoon and told his team they had played well.

Taste of defeat: Moyes suffered his first league loss at Anfield as a Daniel Sturridge gave Liverpool a 1-0 win on September 1

Nightmare: The scale of Moyes's task at Old Trafford became apparent in the 4-1 defeat at rivals Manchester City on September 24

Bad to worse: Moyes can't believe his misfortune as United are beaten at home by West Bromwich on September 28

If talks with Van Gaal don’t work out as expected, United will consider alternative targets such as Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp and Real Madrid’s Carlo Ancelotti.

At 62, Van Gaal is a relatively old manager, but after the experiment with Moyes, United are aware they need a coach with the presence and the experience to cope with a club of their size and profile.

United old boy Phil Neville may survive the backroom cull, as may goalkeeping coach Chris Woods after his exceptional work with David de Gea this season.
