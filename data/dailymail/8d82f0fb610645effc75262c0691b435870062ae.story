Manchester City sent out a warning to their Premier League rivals with a convincing 3-1 win over Liverpool at The Etihad.

Stevan Jovetic scored twice for the hosts, while Sergio Aguero added a third 23 seconds after being introduced as a second-half substitute. Brendan Rodgers' side gained a late consolation when Pablo Zabaleta put through his own net.

Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives his opinion on the performance of the players on Monday evening.

All smiles: Sergio Aguero is congratulated by his team-mates after having an immediate impact as a substitute

MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-2) - TEAM AVERAGE 6.8

Joe Hart - 7

Maybe could have caught a few that he punched but solid and took few risks.

Pablo Zabaleta - 6.5

In his first game back after the World Cup look as solid as ever despite late own goal. Reads the game so well.

Vincent Kompany - 6.5 

Nearly let in Sturridge early on but dominant after that and led his side by example.

Martin Demichelis - 6 

Lucky not to be booked when Sterling outstripped him but better than last season.

Gael Clichy - 8 

Best I’ve seen him play in a few years. His pace was essential in his battle with Sterling.

Outstanding: Gael Clichy produced one of his best displays in years at left-back for Manuel Pellegrini's side

Fernando - 6

Never strayed too far from his central zone. Provided a solid defensive buttress.

Yaya Toure - 6.5

Relatively quiet by his high standards. I’d have liked to see a bit more from him.

Not at his best: Yaya Toure was uncharacteristically quiet in central midfield for the reigning champions

David Silva - 7

Struggled in the first half but much more of an impact when he moved centrally.

Samir Nasri - 6.5

Quiet in the first half but came to life in the second with good movement off the line.

Stevan Jovetic - 8 STAR MAN

Pure instinct for his first and a sublime flick for his second.

Opener: Stevan Jovetic watches as his fierce strike rips into the back of Simon Mignolet's net in first half

Main man: Jovetic has started the season brilliantly for City, and he was the stand-out player on Monday night

Edin Dzeko - 6.5

Not as exciting as City’s other hot-shots but led the line well until he came off. 

SUBS

Sergio Aguero - 7

Looked bright during his time on the pitch and took his goal brilliantly 23 seconds after coming on. 

Clinical: Sergio Aguero needed just 23 seconds to leave his mark on the game - a firm finish past Mignolet

Fernandinho - 6

Jesus Navas - 6 

MANAGER

Manuel Pellegrini - 8 

Went with two strikers and it paid off and you have to applaud that attacking instinct.

Perfect performance: City boss Manuel Pellegrini's decision to play a 4-4-2 against Liverpool paid off

LIVERPOOL (4-3-3) - TEAM AVERAGE 6.3

Simon Mignolet - 5.5

Won’t be happy with the goals he let in, particularly Aguero’s side-foot at the post. 

Glen Johnson - 6

Better at right back, looked quicker than at the World Cup but City were too strong.

Dejan Lovren - 6.5 

If he wants to be the defensive leader he needs to get the back four working as a unit. 

Off the pace: Liverpool's summer signing from Southampton, Dejan Lovren, left, battles with Edin Dzeko

At fault: Alberto Moreno was thrown into the starting line-up by Brendan Rodgers but was culpable for first goal

Martin Skrtel - 6

Solid in the first half when Liverpool were better, but could not keep City at bay. 

Alberto Moreno - 5.5

Hesitation at this level is punished and he had his pocket picked by Jovetic for the goal.

Joe Allen - 6

Was busy in tight areas, moved the ball quickly, and linked well with Gerrard.  

Steven Gerrard - 6.5

Started attacks well with Liverpool in charge but gradually had less of an impact.

Jordan Henderson - 6.5

Made some good, intelligent runs from deep but overrun in midfield late on. 

Philippe Coutinho - 6.5 

Was good going forward but sometimes left the inexperienced Moreno exposed. 

Daniel Sturridge - 7

Showed quick feet and breezed past Kompany in the first half as if he wasn’t there.

Raheem Sterling - 7   

His movement off the ball was good but they didn’t get it to him enough in the middle. 

Bad night at the office: Daniel Sturridge failed to find the back of the net at The Etihad against his former club

SUBS

Rickie Lambert - 6.5

Prompted Liverpool's consolation goal, forcing Zabaleta to bundle in from close range late in the second half.

Emre Can - 6

Lazar Markovic - 6

Late consolation: Pablo Zabaleta puts the ball past Joe Hart under pressure from Rickie Lambert

MANAGER

Brendan Rodgers - 6

Liverpool started well but getting nailed by the Champions this early will affect confidence.

REFEREE

Michael Oliver - 8

No real controversial moments to deal with, though he might have booked Demichelis for bringing down Sterling. Let the game flow and is clearly respected by the players despite his young age.
