The Australian suicide bomber who killed five people in a terrorist attack in Iraq last week is believed to be 18-year-old Adam Dahman.

But the Melbourne teen's family denies he was behind the Baghdad blast, claiming he is alive in Syria.

Online Adam was known as Abu Bakr al Australi. A social media post by the extremist Sunni Muslim group last week claimed he was responsible for the attack.

The Melbourne teen behind the suicide bombing in Baghdad last week is reportedly Adam Dahman

His father Sam Dahman reportedly told the Herald Sun that he had spoken to his son just last week.

'Where is the proof?' he asked, as he demanded to see his son's body.

MailOnline has attempted to contact the Dahman family for comment.

On Monday the federal government confirmed that an 18-year-old Melbourne boy was responsble for the suicide bombing.

Attorney-general George Brandis' office verified that the boy was living in Melbourne until last year, when he left at the age of 17.

He is believed to be the first Australian responsible for a suicide attack in Iraq

He is believed to be the first Australian responsible for a suicide attack in Iraq.

Intelligence sources confirm the culprit was from Melbourne, but fled the country through either Perth or Sydney at some point in 2013.

It is believed that the teenager detonated a belt bomb in a market place in Baghdad, near the Shiite mosque of Abdullah bin Rawah in the main wholesale market of Shorja. The attack killed five and injured as many as 90 people.

The boy is understood to have first arrived in Syria, before travelling to Iraq to become a martyr for terror group, ISIS.

The Islamic militant group have celebrated the attack on social media and is hailing the young Australian as a 'knight'.

The youth is not one of the two Australian teenagers who escaped Australia last month, planning to fight in Iraq and Syria.

Feiz and Abdullah secretly left their homes in June and flew to Turkey from where they are last known to have contacted family members. They are believed to have been trying to cross the border to Iraq to join the warÂ 

16-year-old Feiz, from Bankstown in Sydney's south west, has been found and is preparing to return to Australia. He and his father are allegedly in Lebanon and will return to Australia with assistance from the Australian Federal Police.

Australian teenager Abdullah Elmir's whereabouts remain unknown despite 16-year-old Feiz, who disappeared with him, being found safe and preparing to fly back home with his father

However the second Australian, Abdullah Elmir, 17, is yet to be found.

Elmir's family are gravely concerned for his safety and say he showed no signs of radical behaviour before he fled to the Middle East.

Attorney General George Brandis revealed the number of Australians believed to be supporting extremist groups at a press conference last week.

'There are probably about 60 Australians in Syria fighting for one side or the other but predominantly the anti-government side, and an alarming number of those people are gravitating towards the Al-Qaeda off-shoot,' Mr Brandis said.

'We have some 10s of people who have already returned and we have probably another 150 who we are looking at here in Australia who have

inclinations to support those two extremist movements.'

Online Jihadist recruitment videos are being partially blamed for brainwashing young teenagers to join an Islamic terror group.

Abdullah is believed to have been brainwashed by recruitment videos such as this one by the ISIS, titled There Is No Life Without Jihad, which urges people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'
