Jamie Murray continued his run of good form as the British doubles expert and John Peers cruised through to the third round of the Australian Open on Friday.

Murray and Peers needed just 64 minutes to book their place in the last 16 of the men's doubles as they saw off the home pairing of Omar Jasika and John-Patrick Smith 6-2, 6-3.

Murray said: 'We played a good match from start to finish. It was nice to get through without any hairy moments, unlike the other day, and kind of feel good about our chances going into our next match.'

The British/Australian combination of Murray and Peers have shown promising signs at the start of this year after winning the Brisbane International two weeks ago.

Although the 2015 season is admittedly still young, Murray and Peers currently sit fourth in the ATP Doubles Team rankings, with the top eight qualifying for the season-ending finals at the O2 Arena in London.

The first Grand Slam of the year in Melbourne offers a good opportunity to notch up plenty of ranking points towards London, the pair already earning 180 for their run here.

Murray and Peers, the No 16 seeds, dominated from the off and two breaks saw them claim the opening set, during which they made just one unforced error.

Although Jasika and Smith stepped up their game in the second set, the regular pairing of Murray and Peers were too strong and wrapped up the match with the minimum of fuss.

After having a whole host of different partners through the years, Murray is now reaping the benefits of having a long-term steady partnership with Peers.

Murray, 28, said: 'This is our third year now, I think it’s probably quite a long-term partnership currently on the tour. As usual guys chopped and changed at the end of last year, which is an advantage for us I think, being longer together.

'I think we both made quite a few improvements in the off-season actually, various parts of our games, and that showed in the way we played in Brisbane as well and in the first two matches here.

'We’re happy, we’re feeling good about where our games are at and we’re looking forward to the next round.'

The pair face a potential tough third-round match against No 4 seeds Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo, while Murray has also entered the mixed doubles with Chinese Taipei's Hao-Ching Chan.

Dominic Inglot also joined fellow Brit Murray in the third round as he teamed up with Romanian Florin Mergea for a 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-2 victory against Diego Schwartzman and Horacio Zeballos.

Inglot and Mergea, seeded No 14, could meet top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan next if the American pair beat Carlos Berlocq and Leonardo Mayer on Saturday.

Heather Watson's Australian Open is over, however, after she and Russian partner Alexandra Panova lost 6-0, 6-2 to 12th seeds Alla Kudryavtseva and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the women's doubles.
