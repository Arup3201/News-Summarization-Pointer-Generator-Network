 A storefront in Manhattan's lower East side is advertising a bar just for pregnant women. Whether or not it's a hoax or viral marketing stunt, it's got New York residents birthing anger.

The name of the so-called bar is Gestations and it's located on Fifth Street and Avenue A where pregnant women can supposedly get their alcohol fix for two, reports The New York Post.

'All you mothers-to-be should come check out our trimester specials and our 9-month happy hour because now you’re drinking for two!,' reads the storefront that has people fuming.

Too much?: This advertisement for the first ever pregnant bar in Manhattan's Lower East Side has some enraged

Marketing: The campaign is pregnant with baby jokes like one they posted on their Twitter that reads, 'Never thought we'd see our baby come to life, especially with a billboard in Time Square! ‪#‎gestationsny‬'

Birthing humor or hatred?: Jokes like this had critics fuming, some of whom who took to Facebook and Twitter to bash the campaign for being offensive and insensitive 

The Facebook page offers a titillating image of a woman, who appears to have a photo-shopped pregnant belly, popping a champagne bottle.

The Facebook page points out the fact that both pregnant women and men can drink more because they have bigger bellies.

'The bigger the belly, the more you can drink. True for men and pregnant women. #gestationsny' says a slogan for what might be a viral marketing stunt.

'#gestationsny will have free pregnancy test kits when you buy a pitcher. Check out our profile on #BARTRENDr to see what else we’ll carry,' the Facebook page says.

According to the website Vocativ.com, the racy new bar concept is likely a viral marketing campaign for the bar finding app Bartendr.

Despite the attention grabbing technique being successful, it's a bit of a miscarriage with critics who find the campaign distasteful and offensive.

It seems some may not have realized that the campaign is a farce.

For real?: This is the location where the Gestations bar will allegedly be opening soon

Critics: Some angry readers didn't catch on to the fact that the campaign may be a hoax 

Concerned for health: This woman voiced her concerns about the health dangers for the unborn child  associated with drinking while pregnant 

'This is really sick, a real disparate, how would you entice a pregnant woman to drink alcohol which will take effects on the unborn, this is really ridiculous. I would call on the Dept of Health, to close this stupid peoples door business that are endangering the health of the unborn. umbelievable ..!!!!!!,' writes Vallejo Rafael on Facebook.

Facebook user Angela Holkmann also had a bone to pick with the campaign.

'You are promoting actions that are dangerous to the health of an unborn child. Unfortunately, many babies are born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome that produces learning and behavior disabilities as well as physical ones as well. Everyone know, that excessive drinking is equal to using drugs while pregnant. WHY would you promote this kind of behavior, and I hope that this is a joke?,' she wrote.

Some however thought the campaign was funny and wrote things like, 'What a perfect place to find women already on the ­perfect birth control!'

The Post reports that Community Board 3 Leader Susan Stetzer says that the bar hasn't applied for a liquor license yet so chances are it isn't a real thing.

'They’re saying it’s a bar, but they haven’t applied for a liquor license. At this point it’s nothing . . . Maybe it’s going to be a milk bar or a juice bar,' she said.

'When possible patrons call the business a voice mail of a woman says, 'visit us on October 25 at 504 East Fifth Street before that water breaks.'

The campaign is pregnant with baby jokes like one they posted on their Twitter that reads, 'Never thought we'd see our baby come to life, especially with a billboard in Time Square! ‪#‎gestationsny‬'

Even though patrons of the bar are meant to be expecting, no one knows what to expect from Gestations.
