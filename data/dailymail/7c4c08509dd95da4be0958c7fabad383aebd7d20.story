Mario Balotelli practised alone at Liverpool's Melwood training ground on Monday as he moves to the brink of completing his £16million transfer from AC Milan.

Brendan Rodgers' side face Balotelli's former employers Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium and will be boosted by the announcement before the match that the Italian has become a Liverpool player. He could even join the squad at their Manchester hotel if there is time before the match.

The 24-year-old, who will move from Italian giants Milan in a £16m deal, arrived at Melwood on Monday afternoon to put the finishing touches to the transfer before undergoing a one-on-one session with Liverpool's head of conditioning and fitness, Ryland Morgans. He trained in Liverpool's official training kit, highlighting how close the deal is being to complete.

He travelled to Liverpool's Melwood training ground last week and completed both parts of his medical.

Balotelli has agreed a three-year, heavily incentivised £90,000-per-week contract and Mino Raiola, the forward’s long-term adviser, has urged him to seize the opportunity.

Having already played for Manchester City, Inter Milan and AC Milan it is unlikely Balotelli will get another big move if he fails to settle at Liverpool.

During his time at the Etihad, Balotelli netted 30 goals in 80 appearances.

He also scored 18 goals in 41 matches for Milan last season.
