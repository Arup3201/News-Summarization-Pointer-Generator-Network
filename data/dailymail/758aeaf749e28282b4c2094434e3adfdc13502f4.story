The US Open final that nobody predicted and not everyone wanted was seized on Monday night with unblinking composure by Croatian giant Marin Cilic.

The No 14 seed completed his third consecutive straight sets win to defeat a somewhat overwhelmed Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in less than two hours to deny Japan its equally unlikely Grand Slam winner.

An outstanding performance from Cilic disappointed the millions who rose with the dawn there to watch their new national hero try and became the first Asian-born man to lift one of the sport's biggest prizes.

It completed a remarkable comeback for the 25-year-old Cilic who, this time last year, was sitting out an ultimately truncated doping ban after testing positive for the banned stimulant Nikethamide, which was contained in glucose tablets bought for him by his mother.

While most in the game believe Cilic, who vehemently protested his innocence, to be an honest man guilty only of naivety the fact remains that his triumph is not an entirely good look for the sport.

The one-sided nature of the contest between two relatively unheralded players was certainly a far cry from some of the beguiling thrillers involving the so-called Big Four in recent times. It is not one that will linger long in the memory save, perhaps, for the fact that it is the last US final to be held on a Monday before the reversion to Sundays next year.

That should not detract from a brave and skilfull performance from the mild-mannered Croatian, who rose to the occasion manfully and dictated the whole match with his serve and raking groundstrokes.

Afterwards Cilic paid tribute to his coach, ex Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, saying, 'My team has brought me something, especially Goran. The most important thing he brought to me was to make tennis enjoyable.

'I have played the best of my life here. For all the other players who work hard it shows how it is going to pay off. I think the stars aligned.'

A deflated Nishikori reflected: 'He was playing really well tonight and I couldn't play my tennis. It is a tough loss.'

Helpless: Nishikori had no answers for Cilic's relentless strength

When Nishikori, giving away eight inches in height, threatened to revive with three break points at 2-4 in the third set Cilic held firm and, as in the whole match, his vastly improved serve was there to get him out of trouble.

He closed it out with a cross court backhand winner and fell on his back, Rafael Nadal-style, in his unbridled delight before scaling the stands to celebrate with his supporters.

At the slightly surreal start time of 5pm nobody could be sure how either player would be able to react. It was the first US Open final since 1997, when Greg Rusedski lost to Pat Rafter, to feature two players making their debut in the climax to a Grand Slam.

The victory is not especially good news for Andy Murray, who finds himself outside the world's top ten for the first time in six years at number eleven, and facing a real challenge to qualify for the Barclays ATP World Finals at the O2 Arena.

Cilic's game is impressively functional rather than anything of great beauty, but one outstanding feature is his easy movement for such a tall man, which would grace any NBA basketball team.

A Nishikori strength is his explosive footspeed, but he looked somewhat sluggish from the off, a product of nerves and perhaps his tougher run to the final.

There was no great surprise when he was broken for 2-4, as the towering Croatian was all over his second serve and profiting from a surfeit of unforced errors. He made the breakthrough when a particularly inauspicious sliced forehand that floated wide.

Cilic was making a lot of headway by driving hard and wide to his opponent's backhand and he went ahead in the second set when another one of those went bulging into the net.

The Croatian, saved two break points immediately afterwards, the second one with an ace delivered by a serve that has been part of his considerable improvement.

He blinked when serving for the set at 5-2 but the Japanese was somewhat reminiscent of Andy Murray inhis first US Open final six years ago – looking tired and overwhelmed – and he dropped serve again to fall two behind.

One player never got going while the other was on it from the start – the uneven scale of the contest the final Tale of the Unexpected from the 2014 US Open.
