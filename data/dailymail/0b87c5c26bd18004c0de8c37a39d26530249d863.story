A devoted wife has turned to Facebook in a desperate struggle to find her husband a job after he was made redundant.

Melanie Bertani, 47, posted a string of messages touting her 'enterprising, hard-working' partner Stefano, 46, in a bid to stop him having to sign on for jobseekers' allowance.

Mr Bertani, described as a 'proud' manual labourer, was kept in the dark while he wife sent out the plea, which has now been shared hundreds of times.

Plea: Mrs Bertani, centre left, posted the status, right, without the knowledge if her husband, Stefano, left, in the hope of getting him a job

Headlined: 'May I make an urgent plea' Mrs Bertani, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, said her husband was happy to take 'any' job to avoid having to claim £71 in jobseekers' allowance from the taxpayer every week.

She wrote: 'This big share has taken all my courage, my pride, my honesty and my red raw panic - so please be gentle.

'Stefano, my extremely hard working, enterprising, considerate, kind husband has been sadly made redundant.

'We have a few days left to find him work before we regrettably have to join the benefit system. We do not want this.

'He is willing to do anything, he has experience in the UK in warehouse, stock control, forklift, construction site duties and labourer and holds all relevant cards and licences.

Viral: Mrs Bertani's request has been shared hundreds of times, and she says they have been offered advice and encouragement by strangers

'He is computer literate, has fantastic organisation, office and admin skills, a creative mind and a clean driving license.

'He is educated to university level, gaining surveyor qualifications in Italy. He can provide fabulous references.'

She concluded: 'Please would you mind sharing this everywhere and on all social platforms.

'We are running out of desperate time. I will keep posting it on my wall, I do hope it doesn't start to irritate everyone. He will do anything.'

Hundreds of Facebook users have since shared Mrs Bertani's plea and the couple have received advice, good will messages and tip-offs about possible local vacancies, including a deliveryman at a restaurant.

'It has given us hope': The couple say people have even knocked on their door to wish them well, and that Stefano is in the process of applying for work

Today Mrs Bertani, who has two children, said: 'We may have opened ourselves up but it is worth it to stop my husband going on benefits.

'He's such a proud, hard-working man who is full of honesty and integrity and he hates the idea of having to claim money from the taxpayer.

'He's an enterprising, strong man who never shies away from hard work and simply wants to provide for his family. He is more than willing to get his hands dirty and doesn't want to be seen as some kind of sponger funded by the state.

'The reaction we've had to the posting has been amazing. We've had people including many strangers knocking at our front door with advice and wishing us well.

'It has given us hope and faith in the kindness of people.'

Stefano who has joined a recruitment agency to help with his quest for employment said: 'I just prefer working and earning my own money instead of getting it from the state so I can provide for my family. I don't want to claim benefits.

'I've had strangers come up to me whilst I have been at the agency looking for work to give me some pointers and wish me luck.

'I did feel embarrassed at first because getting a job is so personal but I'm very grateful for their help and being so kind.'
