This is the dramatic moment a murder suspect was arrested in connection with the horrific stabbing of his partner, a mother-of-three, in the back of a taxi.

The man, Junior Saleem Oakes, was arrested in the garden of a house 100 yards away from the scene of the attack in Birmingham after a day-long hunt by armed officers.

He has now been charged with the murder of the victim Natasha Trevis who relatives claim had planned to end her 
five-year-relationship with Oakes the day she died.

Apprehended: Officers lead Junior Saleem Oakes away from a house after arresting him on suspicion of murdering his partner after she was stabbed to death in the back of a taxi

The 28-year-old appeared in court today charged with the murder of the young mother-of-three in a taxi on his birthday.

Stabbing victim Natasha Trevis

Relatives of the 22-year-old victim sobbed in the public gallery as Oakes appeared at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court.

Oakes, of Northfield, Birmingham, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address during the brief hearing.

Dressed in a grey hooded top, he kept his head bowed for much of his appearance.

Miss Trevis, who had two daughters aged three and 18 months and a seven-month-old son, was stabbed repeatedly in the attack and died at the scene.

Neighbours in Dimsdale Road, where the incident happened, said paramedics worked for 30 minutes to try to save the young mother.

An ambulance service spokesman said she was in cardiac arrest when crews arrived.

Speaking outside court, Miss Trevis’s father, Tony Trevis, said: 'She was a beautiful, happy-go-lucky girl, she doted on her kids.

'I’m in shock, it’s too unreal to sink in.

'It’s going to hit me sooner or later but I am trying to be strong for the kids.'

Confirming his arrest last night, West Midlands Police said in a tweet: 'Detectives investigating the death of Natasha Trevis in Northfield have tonight charged a 28-year-old man with her murder.

Fifty police, including armed officers, were involved in a manhunt after the 
alleged attacker fled the scene as the horrified taxi driver dialled 999.

A hunt to find the killer was launched and Oakes, 28, was arrested in connection with the murder in a garden in nearby Allens Farm.

Her aunt, Dawn Jarvis, 35, said: 'I saw Tasha in the pub a few days ago and she said the relationship had broken down.

Major development: Police at the scene of the arrest. Oakes has been charged with murder

'Tasha was such a lovely, bubbly girl. I think Junior’s birthday was on Monday, and Tasha had gone round to 
take him a present and a card.

'We are all just devastated, and can’t understand how this could have happened to our beautiful girl.'

Her cousin Chris Heath said she had been in a relationship with Oakes for five years.

He said: 'She was a caring person, a caring mum, she loved her kids and she wanted to have a perfect family with this guy.

'Words cannot say how much we are going to miss Tasha, she loved life and liked to have a lot of fun.'

Her close family and friends were at the scene today laying floral tributes.

One card read: 'Rest in Peace mummy you’ll be sadly missed and never forgotten.'

Another read: 'To my sweatheart Tasha you are my world, darling love your mum.'

Probe launched: A police officer stands next to the taxi which has become the focus of a murder investigation after a woman was stabbed to death on the back seat

Macabre: Forensic teams erect a white tent around the taxi where a woman was stabbed repeatedly by a man as they were being driven through the Northfield area of Birmingham

Scouring the scene: Detectives during the initial stages of the investigation yesterday

Horror: The woman was attacked in the back of the vehicle near the junction of Dimsdale Road and Hoggs Lane, Northfield, Birmingham at 8am today

The victim was in a taxi owned by cab firm 24/7 Radio Cars when she was attacked.

A woman operator for cab firm 24/7 Radio Cars said: ‘An incident has happened today, but the police 
have asked us not to say anything else.’

A taxi driver added: ‘The woman was young and lived locally. She was a regular customer of 24/7 Radio Cars.’

Jennifer Pickering, 37, who lives on nearby Dimsdale Road, said: ‘It’s 
really tragic, this is a nice area. I’ve lived here 36 years and nothing
like this has ever happened.’

‘We use the taxi firm quite a lot and they are all really nice, friendly
drivers - the driver who called the police must have been horrified 
when a passenger was stabbed.

‘That will haunt him for life. Nobody deserves to be put through that when they are just trying to do their job.’

Preserving crime scene: A police officer cordons off the area as dozens of his colleagues launched a manhunt for the suspect, believed to be the woman's partner

Tragedy: Paramedics desperately tried to resuscitate the woman, who they said was suffering a heart attack, but she died at the scene

Massive operation: Fifty police, including armed officers, were drafted in to search for the suspected killer

Anna Fogarty, 42, who also lives nearby, added: ‘There were all sorts, 
an air ambulance landed on the green and there were dogs and police with
big guns around hunting for the man.’

Lucy Richards, 37, of Dimsdale Road, said: ‘It’s a horrible thing to happen on your street.’

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that 
we were called to reports of a woman in a taxi who had suffered multiple
serious injuries.

‘A rapid response vehicle, an ambulance, a paramedic officer and the 
Midlands Air Ambulance from Cosford with a doctor on board attended the 
scene.

‘The woman was in traumatic cardiac arrest with multiple stab wounds.

‘Emergency treatment was immediately carried out, including specialist advanced life-support techniques.

‘Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of all medics in attendance, 
nothing could be done to save the woman and she was confirmed dead at 
the scene.’

Gathering clues: Hoggs Lane and nearby Dimsdale Road and Norrington Road were closed while detectives carried out forensic examinations
