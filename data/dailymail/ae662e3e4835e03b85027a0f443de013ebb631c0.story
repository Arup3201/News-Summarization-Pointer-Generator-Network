A memoir when you're still a teenager may seem premature, but not for Mo'ne Davis, the first female pitcher to win a Little League World Series game.

'Mo'ne Davis: Remember My Name' will be released next March by HarperCollins Children's Books, the publisher told The Associated Press on Monday.

The honor roll student from Philadelphia became a sensation last summer after leading the Taney Dragons to a 4-0 victory over Nashville, when she was just 13.

Known for her long braids and uncommon poise, she has since appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, thrown out the first pitch at a major league World Series game and starred in a car commercial directed by Spike Lee. 

In September, she even donated her jersey to the baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.

'When I joined an all-boys baseball team, my mom wasn't too happy,' Mo'ne said in a statement issued Monday through HarperCollins.

'I proved to her (and to me) that I could do anything I set my mind to. I'm just a girl that likes to play sports and I'm excited to share my story with everyone,' she said.

Davis also said 'I hope it encourages people to take a chance and play the sports they want to play and not just the ones people expect them to play.'

In August, Davis told ESPN '[Baseball] isn't my favorite sport. It's just that I don't really go anywhere for basketball because I don't play AAU and there's no time in the summer for me to play basketball. But I like basketball more than this.'

She also said 'Follow your dream. Yeah, follow your dream and don't let anyone else tell you that you can't do something.' 

Davis also told the sports network that month 'I want to go to UConn and be the point guard on the team. That's like my dream and then go into the WNBA. That's for [head coach Geno Auriemma]. Geno has to know.' 

Later this month, she and her fellow Taney Dragons will help kick off the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

Financial terms for the book deal were not disclosed. Author Hilary Beard, whose previous collaborations include 'Promises Kept: Raising Black Boys to Succeed in School and in Life,' will assist Davis with her memoir. 

According to the book's page with HarperCollins, 'Mo'ne Davis: Remember My Name' will be released on March 17 and will cost $16.99.
