When Richard Dimbleby died of cancer in 1965, his two sons vowed to ensure his legacy would live on.

Now David and Jonathan Dimbleby have donated £2million to an innovative cancer centre, to be built in honour of the distinguished broadcaster.

The centre, which will accommodate a range of leading services, is under construction at Guy’s Hospital in London and is due to open in 2016.

The brothers donated the money through their charity, Dimbleby Cancer Care, which they have run for more than four decades.

Yesterday, Jonathan Dimbleby told the Mail their extraordinary gift was thanks to the generosity of the British public.

He said: ‘When my father died, he was the first public figure ever to say beforehand that he had cancer.

‘There was a great outpouring of public grief at the time. Money poured in, in sack-fulls.

‘We
thought about donating it to a number of charities at first, but then 
we realised that it was so big that we should set up our own charity.

‘Cancer
was a taboo subject back then, but my father’s death showed that anyone
can get cancer. It allowed us to raise the funds that we have done for 
these cancer services.

‘All of the money we are giving has come from public donations.’

The
Dimblebys were in their 20s when their father died aged 52 at St 
Thomas’, which is now part of the same NHS Foundation Trust as Guy’s.

They established the Richard Dimbleby Cancer Fund, which was relaunched as Dimbleby Cancer Care in 2008.

Charity
staff work alongside medical professionals at the hospital to provide 
support and information to anyone affected by cancer.

They were one of the first charities to recognise that patients need pastoral care alongside their treatment for the disease.

Mr Dimbleby added: ‘We’ve been working there for 40 years and we have always recognised ourselves as pioneering.

‘We were among the first to offer psychological support services.’

To
raise money to support the centre and fund cancer research, the 
brothers are hosting a concert at St Bartholomew the Great in 
Smithfields today.

The show will include a performance 
by Voce, a choir that sang with the Rolling Stones at Glastonbury and in
Hyde Park earlier this year.

The centre, which will accommodate a range of leading services, is under
construction at Guy's Hospital in London and is due to open in 2016

He added: ‘It’s going to be a great evening. Turn up and see if you can get in. It will be a rocking good night.’

Guy’s and St Thomas’ Chief Executive Ron Kerr said: ‘The Dimbleby family are close friends of our organisation and long-term supporters of our cancer services.

‘This latest and very generous gift will ensure the new Cancer Centre at Guy’s is a truly exceptional place for our patients, allowing them to benefit from the best possible care, as well as the latest research and treatments.’

All Dimbleby Cancer Care services will move into the new £160 million Cancer Centre at Guy’s when it is complete.
