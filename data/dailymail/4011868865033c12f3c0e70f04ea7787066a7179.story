The skull of missing Little Rock businessman John Glasgow was found on Wednesday in a rugged area of Petit Jean Mountain

Bone fragments and skeletal remains have been found in a rugged area of Petit Jean Mountain where the skull of missing Little Rock businessman John Glasgow was found earlier this week.

The skull, found on Wednesday by hikers, was identified through dental records as being Glasgow, who was 45 when he disappeared in 2008. 

A search crew of 20, aided by dogs, had been dispatched on Thursday to the area where the remains were found, but the search was suspended due to poor weather on Sunday. 

The more remains that are found, the better the chance of determining the cause of death, state Crime Laboratory Director Kermit Channel told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

'We will rely on law enforcement to continue their investigation and search. As they discover additional human remains, they will be submitted to us to examine,' Channel said.

The remains were found within a mile of where Glasgow's vehicle was last seen parked at the time of his disappearance. That mile, however, is 'as the crow flies' and includes lengthy, boulder-laden, steep trails, Butts said.

When the recovery efforts resume on Monday, officials will begin more intensive searching that will include cadaver dogs and metal detectors.

'We even have an archaeologist that will be coming with the Arkansas State Police,' Butts said.

'They will work to determine how far the remains have been distributed and what to look for after so many years have passed.'

Glasgow, the chief financial officer of CDI Contractors LLC, was last seen leaving his Little Rock home on the morning of January 28, 2008. 

The firm, owned by Dillard's and the estate of co-founder Bill Clark, built or remodeled many of Dillard's 300-plus department stores and put up some of Arkansas' signature projects, including former President Bill Clinton's library and the headquarters of Heifer International. 

A cellphone trace had led investigators to the Petit Jean State Park, a mountaintop resort an hour from his home, but weeks of searching revealed no clues. Glasgow was legally declared dead in 2011.

Judge H. Vann Smith wrote at the time that 'The circumstantial evidence of John's death is substantial. John has been missing for three years without any credible information surfacing in that period that would suggest he might be alive somewhere.'

In that same year, a twice-convicted felon named Jonathan Brawner told his lawyer and the Little Rock Police Department that he knew where Glasgow's body was buried. 

Brawner said that he had been recruited by 'thugs from Malvern' to whom he owed money to help bury Glasgow in a bean field near England in Lonoke County.

The bean field was searched, but no remains were found.
