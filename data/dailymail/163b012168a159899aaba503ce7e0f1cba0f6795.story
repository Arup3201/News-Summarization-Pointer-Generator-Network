An unusual New York property which has been likened to the gingerbread house in the Hansel and Gretel fairytale - has gone on sale for $11m (£7.2m).

The building, which has become a famous landmark in Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, was built in 1917 for a former shipping magnate when the area was home to the city's rich and famous.

With its rustic stone walls, cast-iron doorknobs, stained-glass window, beamed ceilings and thatched roof - the property is expected to attract keen interest from wealthy buyers looking for a quirky home.

Fairytale: This unusual property, nicknamed the 'Hansel and Gretel house,' has gone on sale for $11m (£7.2m). The building - which is a famous landmark in Bay Ridge in Brooklyn - New York, was built in 1917 for a former shipping magnate

Quirky: The building has thick patchwork boulder walls, cast-iron doorknobs, a stained-glass window, beamed ceilings and a thatched roof. It is expected to attract keen interest from buyers looking for a quirky home

Luxury: The house has retained lots of its original features, including a luxurious lounge with carved wood panelling, beamed roof and eye catching glass work

The six-bedroom home was previously owned by two sisters between the 1940s and 1970s but the pair only lived in the service quarters. That is the reason current owners Jerry and Diane Fishman believe the house has stayed so true to its original design and in such good condition.

Mr Fishman, who has owned the house since 1985, said: 'My mother used to push me in my stroller past the house and one time I got out and tried to get in.

'When I was a student I studied right across the road and would just sit in class staring out the window at the house in a trance. My grades suffered.

'On my first date with Diane we drove past and I told her 'one day I'm going to own that house.''

Dream home: The property was bought during the 1980s by Jerry Fishman who had loved it since childhood. It is expected to attract interest from buyers looking for a quirky home

Unusual: The building is more like a country cottage than a New York town house. It was owned for many years by sisters who lived only in the servants' quarters

Historic: The home's dining room would not look out of place in an English castle with its stone fireplace and wood panel walls

Mr Fishman said he finally got a chance to buy his dream home when his broker called him during the mid-1980s to tell him it was up for sale.

'Everyone in the neighbourhood knew I wanted to live there,' he said.'The day we moved in kids would run up and ring the doorbell for a look inside. It was relentless so after a while we had to cut the wire - we've lived without a doorbell ever since.'

Listing agent at Douglas Elliman, Rita van Straten, said: 'You can pick any angle and this place cannot look bad. Inside it's like a museum.'
