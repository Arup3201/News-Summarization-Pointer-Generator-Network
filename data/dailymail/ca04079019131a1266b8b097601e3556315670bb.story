Convicted child killer: Luke Mitchell is taking his fight to the Supreme Court

A convicted Scottish child killer - who slit his girlfriend's throat repeatedly with a knife - could soon be released by England's Supreme Court.

Luke Mitchell is trying to get his 2005 conviction for killing his girlfriend Jodi Jones, 14, overturned.

He claims his trial was unfair as he was denied access to a lawyer during police interview and says evidence taken from that interview was 'crucial' to the Crown's case against him.

In April, the Appeal Court in Edinburgh ruled his life sentence should stand, and refused to refer his case to the Supreme Court in London.

And so his legal team is taking their fight directly to the English capital - in a move which has escalated the row between the Scottish government and Westminster over the independence of Scots law.

Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond has accused the Supreme Court of undermining his country's law.

It could see Mitchell freed - because English judges have previously ruled the Scottish system of letting suspects be held and questioned for six hours without access to a lawyer breaches the European Convention on Human Rights.

Mitchell, 22, was handed a life sentence in 2005 after he was found guilty of murdering Jodi Jones, 14, in Dalkeith, Midlothian, in 2003.

He has always maintained his innocence and said his trial was unfair because, under the Scottish legal system, he was not allowed to have a lawyer for six hours.

The system has since been declared a breach of human rights under the Cadder ruling.

Judges in London upheld an appeal by teenager Peter Cadder, whose assault conviction was based on evidence gained before he spoke to his lawyer. His lawyers argued this was a breach of his human rights.

In 2009, he was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court of two assaults and a breach of the peace following an incident in the city in May 2007.

Even though the High Court is the highest court of criminal appeal in Scotland, it was overruled by the Supreme Court on a constitutional issue.

This was because the need to consider European human rights legislation was written into the Scotland Act - the piece of Westminster legislation which established devolution.

In light of the Cadder ruling, 867 cases were abandoned, including 60 serious cases, nine of which were High Court cases.

Contrary to the landmark Cadder Supreme Court decision, the Appeal Court in Edinburgh ruled in April  that Mitchell's conviction should stand.

Lord Justice General, Lord Hamilton and two other judges dismissed Mitchell's claim that his human rights had been breached.

Undermined: Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond has accused the Supreme Court of undermining Scots law

And so Mitchell’s legal team is going directly to the Supreme Court in London, which Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond has accused of undermining Scots law, to plead 'exceptional circumstances'.

Nicholas Scullion, head of a Scottish law firm, told the Sunday Express: 'The Supreme Court probably will call this in and if so, they have to release him.

'Alex Salmond knows it’s not going to be popular, so it could not have gone better for him... English judges freeing a Scottish child murderer.'

English barrister Jodie Blackstock, who acted for Peter Cadder when he won his landmark ruling, said Mitchell’s case was very similar.

In June 2003, Mitchell murdered Jodi in woods near Roan's Dyke path, between their homes in the Newbattle and Easthouses area of Dalkeith, Midlothian.

Her throat was slit by between 12 and 20 blows with a knife, and extensive mutilation of the face and body was inflicted after death.

Jodi had failed to return home after going to meet Mitchell.

He claimed she had not arrived, and he spent the evening with friends. He said he later learned from Jodi's family that she was missing and joined in a search.

He claimed he was alerted by his dog jumping up at Roan's Dyke, and went over the wall to find Jodi's body.

But other people who were there said he had gone straight to a break in the wall and made the discovery.

The prosecution at his trial asserted that, as the killer, he had known the body was there and had pretended to find it by accident.

Mitchell was found guilty by a jury and given a life sentence.
