Planning a street party or a  day out to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee?

You may want to make sure you  have an umbrella, some warm clothing – and an indoor option. 

The cold and wet weather is set to last into June, forecasters have warned, and it’s threatening to rain on the royal parade up and down the country.

Yesterday, as snow fell as far south as the Midlands and the bitterly cold May weather continued to disappoint, fears were raised of a washout for the Jubilee next month, when 1.5million wellwishers will turn out to see the Queen and millions more will take part in street parties.

What a catch: Hailstones fell in London yesterday afternoon due to the unseasonably cold weather

As Her Majesty continues her 4,000  mile tour across the UK on the first weekend of June, it is likely to be cloudy, with heavy rain and below average temperatures in the south.

Street parties could be ruined by the weather and motorists have been warned to expect traffic chaos over the four-day weekend, with more than eight million expected to hit the roads on June 1.

And it means there is little prospect of respite from the current grey skies and chilly weather, which led to snow showers in Teesdale in County Durham and parts of Wolverhampton yesterday. 

An intense burst of chilly air from the Arctic was blamed for the unseasonable weather, as temperatures plummeted to just 1c (34f) overnight.

Elsewhere yesterday, heavy rain flooded roads in Cambridgeshire, stormy seas soaked walkers on the promenade in Scarborough, North Yorkshire and hail pelted large areas of London.

Chilly: Cold northerly winds brought in wintry showers to higher ground, including the Pennines, Shropshire, parts of Wales and Scotland

Wintery: Pedestrians in Birmingham were left hoping their umbrellas could cope as the season's poor weather continued with a hail storm hitting the city

A woman in her 50s was left fighting  for her life with serious head injuries after she was crushed by a metal fence which blew down in strong winds in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, at around lunchtime.  Witnesses saw a huge gust of wind rip the fence from its hinges and on to shoppers.

Temperatures reached highs  of just 12c (54f) during the  day, though they are predicted  to pick up towards the end of the week. While snow does regularly fall in May in Scotland and high ground areas such as the Pennines, it is fairly unusual to see it dusting areas of lower ground.

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘We saw sleet and snow showers around eight or nine o’clock in the morning in north-east England and the north-west Midlands, coming in from the  Arctic and Scandinavia.

‘They were very intense showers and cold air, so the snow hit low ground areas, but it quickly melted and we are expecting dry weather on Wednesday, though still chilly. 

‘Temperatures should pick up  to around average by Friday or Saturday at around 16c (61f) in the south.’

Cold northerly winds also brought wintry showers to higher ground, including the Pennines, Shropshire, parts of Wales and Scotland.

University lecturer Neil Farrington, 41, was walking his dogs in Castleside, near Consett, County Durham, when the snow fell yesterday. The father of three said: ‘It lasted for 20 minutes and it came down quite heavily with big flakes. 

‘It was quite a sight to behold, then it turned to rain and the snow on the ground disappeared. My oldest son was supposed to be playing cricket tonight so he was not best pleased.’

Chris Burton, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said:  'It is late to snow and it has happened because northerly winds brought colder air down from the Arctic and Scandinavia.

'We have showers that can turn wintry on higher ground.'

Meanwhile in the south, floods swamped roads in Essex and Cambridgeshire.

Drivers have been taking a risk by driving through flooded country roads to avoid a 27-mile detour to reach the village of Welney in the Cambridgeshire Fens.

The road across Welney Washes was closed for the first time in two years and the only other way into the village means a long drive through narrow country lanes.

Dennis Birch, who runs The Lamb and Flag pub in Welney, said: 'It's a 27-mile detour to reach us without going through the floods which adds an extra hour to people's journeys and they have to use more petrol.

'The floods make it difficult for us as we rely on passing trade.'

Forecasters warn Britain will be hit by the latest cold snap this week for up to a month.

Many parts of the country are facing several weeks worth of night-time frost, freezing winds, hail and heavy rain.

A jet stream over Europe is stopping warm air arriving from the Continent and causing arctic conditions to blow across the country.

The north of the country will be the worst hit as temperatures plummet to -6C with snow expected across the Pennines and Cumbria while the south faces days of rain and blustery winds.

Jonathan Powell, forecaster with Vantage Weather Services, said: 'It looks like this is going to continue well into June. Summer is really on hold, with no sign of it in the near future.

'Temperatures are well below where they should be for the time of year and snow, ice and conditions more akin to the middle of November are going to stick around into the first two weeks in June.

'We are in for a very wet, cool and miserable time, with no sign of summer on the way.”

The Met office said the brief warm spell over the weekend was down to an area of high pressure which drifted over the UK but has now been replaced by northerly air from Scandinavia and northern Europe.

Showers are expected to have hit all parts of the country by Thursday and to continue well into June.

It comes in stark contrast to scenes around the UK at the weekend as Britons made the most of the nice weather, heading to local beaches and parks.
