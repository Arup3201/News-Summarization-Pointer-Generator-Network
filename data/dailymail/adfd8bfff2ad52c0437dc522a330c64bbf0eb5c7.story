Steven Taylor says Newcastle's recent run of form has given the players some much-needed self-belief, and insisted Alan Pardew has the whole team's backing.

Ayoze Perez's second-half strike was enough to secure an impressive victory for Newcastle over a beleaguered Liverpool, and move Pardew's side into the top half of the Premier League. 

'The belief is back now. We showed what we're all about,' Taylor told BT Sport. 'There was a great atmosphere today. Everybody's fully behind him (Pardew) we just need to keep winning. We've got a bit of momentum but we can't get carried away.'

Algerian midfielder Mehdi Abeid made his first start for Newcastle in the win, and the 22-year-old said he was delighted to be back at the club after three loan spells.

He said: 'I've been out on loan for a long time. Now I'm back I'm just trying to do my best. I've tried to be patient and all the work has paid off for me.' 

Pardew witnessed pockets of support for him in what has been a hostile home crowd, but the 53-year-old refused to pay too much attention to either the praise or criticism he has been receiving.

He said: 'I did see it (the banner voicing support for him). I was surprised but listen, this is Newcastle. Bobby Robson said the highs are massive here but the lows are equally as low. He needed a tin hat at times. I Need a tin hat at times.'

The only negative to come from the game for Newcastle were the injuries to Gabriel Obertan and Papiss Cisse

Pardew said: 'Papiss wasn't moving properly. He's got this irritation on his knee. He thought he was OK (to play). We disagreed. 

'The only big problem we had was losing Obertan. He's been outstanding and we're all really disappointed for him.'
