Sixteen Amish men and women accused of cutting people's hair and beards are set to go on trial this week over the alleged hate crime.

As jury selection began at a court in Cleveland on Monday, the defendants were supported by a dozen women from the community, all dressed nearly identically in traditional outfits.

The accused, most of whom are related to one another, are charged in three separate attacks on nine people, including the parents of some of the suspects.

Support: Amish women attending the start of the trial of 16 people accused of beard-cutting hate crime attacks

Jury selection: Monday saw the opening of the trial, whose charges date back to last autumn

The series of crimes rocked the normally quiet, pacifist Amish community in southeast Ohio.

The assaults were considered especially egregious because the beard is a symbol of a man's identity among the Amish, and women in the community do not cut their hair for biblical reasons.

Federal prosecutors say the attacks were revenge for a dispute between Samuel Mullet Sr and other Amish bishops after those bishops disputed the excommunication of eight families from Mullet's breakaway group.

Authorities accused Mullet, 66, of being the ringleader of the assaults, although they say he was not present during any of them.

Unprecedented: The Amish usually sort out their disputes within the community rather than involving goverment officials

Charges: If found guilty of a hate crime, the 16 defendants could face many years in prison

Officials said conversations recorded in jail before federal charges were brought revealed that he was planning more attacks.

Mullet and the others face 10 counts, including obstruction, conspiracy and a federal hate crime, 'for willfully causing bodily injury because of actual and perceived religion'.

Two defendants, Mullet and Lester Miller, have filed motions arguing that the hate crime statute, which carries a possible life sentence, does not apply to intra-religious disputes and is a violation of the separation of powers.

Seven defendants, including Mullet, have been in custody since their arrest in October.

Unusual: The defendants are said by some to belong to a breakaway cult hostile to other Amish

Defiant: Those accused have repeatedly rejected plea deals with prosecutors

Last week, judge Dan Polster ruled that prosecutors are not permitted to refer to Mullet's community using terms that may be derogatory, like 'cult' or 'sect,' but they will be able to present evidence of Mullet's sexual 'counselling' of female members of his group even though he has not been charged with a sex crime.

Another earlier ruling allows the defence to argue that the cutting of a person's hair or beard does not constitute bodily harm even though the Amish believe married men and women must abstain from cutting their hair.

Members of the Amish community will not be required to be sworn in before testifying because oath-taking is considered a violation of their religion.

The judge has banned cameras and blogging from the courtroom during the trial.
