Jonas Gutierrez says he will never forgive Newcastle United for the way he was treated during his battle with testicular cancer.

The 31-year-old was told to find a new club when he returned having beaten the illness for the first time in November 2013.

Gutierrez was eventually loaned out to Norwich City for the remainder of the season. The cancer, however, returned last summer and he underwent a course of chemotherapy in Argentina.

He returned to Tyneside in December and was afforded an emotional welcome when he made his first appearance earlier this month during the 1-0 defeat at home to Manchester United.

But Gutierrez – who paid for his own medical treatment - says he remains hurt by the manner in which the club hierarchy and manager Alan Pardew told him he was not needed following his initial battle with cancer.

'I won't be able to forgive the way I've been treated, no,' he said in an interview with Canal+.

'I don't think it was the right time nor the circumstances and I think at times like that, you should look after the individual, the player.

'I was operated on in Argentina. They removed the testicle. The post-surgery studies were good and well, I went back to England after being discharged. 

'I returned mid-November (2013) and at the beginning to mid-December the manager said I should find myself another club, that it was best. I understand a lot of things about football that, well, that for the directors it is a business, no?

'It is clear that they look after the club's interests, but I think in a situation like that, you need to save (consider) other things, even more as I had been playing for five years before having this problem. I was always playing.

'And I never asked for anything. I paid for it [medical treatment] because, for me, the most important thing was my health.'

Gutierrez is out of contract in the summer and it is thought he will leave after seven years at St James' Park. However, the winger admits he would prefer to stay for at least one more season.

'I know the situation here (at Newcastle) isn't the easiest but I'm going to fight to remain here. Time will tell what I can do and it's in my control to leave everything, to give the best of me and see how far I can get,' he said.

'Without doubt one, after a problem like I had, sees things from a different perspective and the order of priorities changes.

'But it's also difficult to get other people to understand because for everyone their own troubles are more important, aren't they?

'I think the most important thing is health. Health and happiness. Sometimes we get into a lot of trouble for things that really aren't significant.'
