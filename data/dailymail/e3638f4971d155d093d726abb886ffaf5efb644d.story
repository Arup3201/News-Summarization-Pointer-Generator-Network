He's photographed everyone from Jerry Hall and Kate Moss to Mick Jagger and Damon Albarn but David Bailey says the secret of his success isn't being a dab hand with a camera - it's because he 'falls in love' with each and every one of his subjects.

'I'm a whore, I fall in love with them while they're with me,' Bailey told the Telegraph. 'Whether they're a man - I try to keep away from dogs - or a woman.

'You just have to fall in love with people so they're at the centre of your universe for that two or three hours or all day you're with them.

'Of course sex inspires me,' he added. 'Of course it does.'

And Bailey's romantic urges haven't always remained behind the camera, with the photographer's fourth wife Catherine making regular appearances in her husband's work - and in the forthcoming exhibition.

Bailey, whose former wives include French actress Catherine Deneuve and model Marie Helvin, also enjoyed a relationship with supermodel Jean Shrimpton - an affair immortalised in BBC4 film We'll Take Manhattan, featuring Dr Who star Karen Gillan as Shrimpton and White Queen actor Aneurin Barnard as Bailey.

Bailey made the comments as it was announced that 250 of his portraits will go on display at the National Portrait Gallery from next February.

The exhibition, entitled Bailey's Stardust, will include plenty of famous faces - among them Jack Nicholson and Damon Albarn - and will feature an entire room filled with portraits of his wife Catherine.

Other highlights include a 1989 portrait of his wife Catherine, a playful shot of Jerry Hall and the late Helmut Newton in Cannes in 1978, and a 1957 self-portrait taken during the 75-year-old photographer's time doing National Service in Singapore.

Sandy Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery, London, commented: ‘Bailey’s Stardust is a very special event.

'It offers an exceptional opportunity to enjoy the widest range of the mercurial portraits created by David Bailey, one of the world’s greatest image-makers.’

The exhibition will run from February until June next year and will be accompanied by a
 Bailey-designed glossy book of the same name.
