A long awaited report on national curriculum has raised concerns about teachers' poor grammar and punctuation.

The federal government released the 288-page report by former teacher and Liberal staffer Kevin Donnelly and business professor Ken Wiltshire and its initial response on Sunday. 

It recommenced a de-cluttered, parent friendly and back to basics approach.

Excessive content was affecting students' learning quality in particular at primary school, while literacy and numeracy skills including phonics needed to be prioritised.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott believes sending schools back to basics, as recommended in the review, will boost the economy and students' job prospects.

But critics warn that approach could leave youngsters without the skills to navigate the 21st century.

The Prime Minister wants to see more focus on getting the basics right so youngsters graduate with the ability to read, write, count, think and understand Australia and the world around them.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne flagged he'd like to see most of the 30 recommendations adopted and maintained the review was not an 'ideological document'.

'There's nothing in it that I can see that the states and territories would baulk at because none of it is trying to drive a political agenda,' Mr Pyne told reporters in Adelaide.

The report was critical of Western civilisation and Australia's Judeo-Christian heritage being demonised in the curriculum.

The key findings in the national curriculum report are that more flexibility is needed, greater focus on literacy and numeracy in primary school, more parent friendly, grammar and punctuation training for teachers

It recommended scaling back focus on indigenous history and Asian studies.

Mr Pyne said the original curriculum architects might have 'gone too far in one direction'.

'We don't want any politics in schools ... we want our children to be focused on learning,' he said.

In relation to teacher's poor grammar and punctuation Mr Pyne said 'It's hard to expect teachers who have never been taught grammar, to teach it.'

Opposition education spokeswoman Kate Ellis acknowledged the curriculum implemented under the previous Labor government was not perfect.

But she accused Mr Pyne of playing a 'game of distraction' to mask broken promises on the six year Gonski school funding deals.

*Needs to be more parent friendly

*Curriculum body should become a private company

ENGLISH

*More emphasis on western canons of literature especially poetry

HISTORY

The Abbott government has only committed to the first four years. The bulk of the funding was set to come in years five and six.

The Australian Education Union said tinkering with the curriculum would not change the disparity between well off and disadvantaged schools.

Greens Senator Penny Wright said the review reignited the 'culture wars'.

'(The) review seems to be suggesting we can just put Aboriginal culture and history in a box, bring it out once a year, and forget about it the rest of the time,' she said.

Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said the education system should help create well rounded members of a liberal democracy.

The reviewers received 1600 public submissions.

The federal government will release its final response to the review in early 2015 after Mr Pyne has consulted with his state and territory counterparts.
