Home Secretary Theresa May today named Warwickshire Police Chief Constable Keith Bristow as the head of the new National Crime Agency.

Mrs May said Mr Bristow will 'develop an agency of powerful operational crime fighters who will ensure those who commit serious and organised crime are tracked down, pursued and brought to justice'.

The new National Crime Agency is expected to start its work in December 2012.

The FBI-style police force will tackle the rising threat of organised crime gangs and beef up border security.

The NCA will replace the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), which  Labour launched in a blaze of publicity in 2006. Soca has been criticised for failing to recover the proceeds of organised crime.

Mrs May today said: 'I am delighted to announce Keith Bristow as the new head of the National Crime Agency.

'For too long we have lacked a strong, collaborative national response in the fight for criminal justice. The NCA will make the UK a more hostile environment for serious and organised crime and strengthen our border.

'In his new role, Keith Bristow will 
develop an agency of powerful operational crime fighters who will ensure
those who commit serious and organised crime are tracked down, pursued 
and brought to justice.

'Keith Bristow will be the NCA's first operational head and will play a vital role in developing the new agency.'

Keith Bristow was appointed Chief Constable of Warwickshire Police in 2006.

He joined West Mercia Constabulary as a police cadet and then served through to the rank of Detective Chief Inspector in a range of uniform and specialist posts.

In 1997, he was appointed as Staff Officer to the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).

The following year he was selected for promotion to Superintendent and seconded to the West Midlands Police Major Investigation Team.

Mr Bristow said: 'The NCA will protect communities and individuals from harm by tackling serious, organised and complex crime.

'In partnership with other law enforcement agencies, we will ensure that criminals are identified, pursued and brought to justice, their groups dismantled and their activities disrupted. We will do even more to strip away their illegally obtained assets.

'Officers and staff from existing agencies that will become part of the NCA are already working hard to tackle serious, organised and complex crime and new approaches and capabilities will become operational before 2013 to cut crime and protect our borders.

'I shall be working closely with Chief Constables, leaders of other law-enforcement organisations, Police Authorities, Police and Crime Commissioners and the Government to ensure that the NCA delivers the maximum protection possible for communities within the resources it has available.'

In 2009, damning figures revealed 
that Soca clawed back only £78million over its first three years, despite 
the agency costing the public £1.2billion.
Soca employed a chairman, a director-general, ten directors and 30 deputy directors.

Under government plans, the NCA will be tasked with pursuing serious criminals, including people-traffickers and drug-smugglers.
