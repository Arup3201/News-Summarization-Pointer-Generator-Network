An amateur rugby player has been jailed after he punched an opponent so hard during an on-pitch row over a tackle that he broke his jaw.

Jack Weston struck teacher Ben Staunton twice in the head after a scuffle broke out during a heated local derby.

Despite being in agony after the second blow, which he described as having a ‘ten out of ten’ force, Mr Staunton, 34, continued playing until the end of the game.

Only later was he found to have a broken jaw.

On Monday Weston, 24, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm and was jailed for six months at Bristol Crown Court.

The players’ brawl happened as 
Weston’s team Keynsham RFC took on rivals Oldfield Old Boys at their 
Bath ground in a bad-tempered clash in November in the Bath Combination 
Cup.

Amy Jones, prosecuting, told the court
that it had been a ‘hotly contested’ match in which there were a number
of off-the-ball incidents.

Around 25 minutes into the second 
half, violence flared when a penalty kick was awarded after an illegal 
tackle on Oldfield substitute Mr Staunton, a teacher at Beechen Cliff 
Boys’ School in Bath.

Mr Staunton, who had been tackled in the air as he caught the ball, ‘reacted angrily’ and pushed a player away.

He was quickly surrounded by four 
opponents, one of whom he claimed had a hand around his face and another
who was ‘gouging’ his eye.

Weston then ran into the fracas and 
punched Mr Staunton twice in the face – the first described as ‘six out 
of ten’ in force and the second a ‘full ten out of ten’.

Brutal: Weston was jailed for six months after admitting grievous bodily harm at Bristol Crown Court

‘Almost immediately I felt my teeth stinging,’ the teacher said in a statement read in court.

‘I remember looking at Mr Weston and he had taken a step backwards, he looked ready to go again.’

Weston was sent off by the referee and
Mr Staunton – who played in a second row position – received a warning 
yellow card. Immediately after the incident a physio examined Mr 
Staunton but found no fracture and allowed him to play on.

Following the game, however, the 
teacher’s pain worsened, forcing him to visit Royal United Hospital in 
Bath where the court heard that an X-ray confirmed his jaw was broken.

Andrew Banks, defending, said: ‘Mr 
Weston has always said it was something that occurred in the heat of the
moment. It is something he bitterly regrets.’

He told the court how Weston, of 
Bedminster, Bristol, apologised to the referee after the game but was 
unable to find Mr Staunton to apologise in person.

Mr Banks added that his client believed he had grabbed the player and punched him only once.

Following the judge’s call for clarification, however, it was accepted that the referee saw two punches.

Jailing Weston, Judge Carol Hagen told him: ‘I have no doubt you will never re-offend.’

Keynsham’s Paul Cooper, who was also 
sent off during the match, was last month banned from playing for seven 
weeks after being found guilty of making contact with the area around Mr
Staunton’s eye.
