Cardiff Blues have announced that Owen Williams is making 'positive progress' as he continues his recovery from the serious neck injury sustained last month.

The Wales centre has spent the last three weeks at the Welsh Spinal Injuries and Neurological Rehabilitation Unit at Rookwood Hospital in Cardiff.

In an encouraging update issued by his region, it was revealed that Williams has improved function in both of his upper limbs, although remains on enforced bed rest.

Tough guy: Owen Williams is making progress in his recovery from a serious neck injury sustained last month

'Owen will be progressing to sitting up over the coming few weeks,' a Blues statement read.

'While it's still early days in his recovery, Owen remains positive and overwhelmed by the messages of support from around the world.

'Owen and his family would like to thank the media for their support and the continued respect of his privacy.'

Williams suffered a significant injury to his cervical vertebrae and spinal cord that required surgery during the inaugural World Club 10s competition in Singapore.

The 22-year-old was playing in a third place play-off game against Asia Pacific Dragons when he sustained the fracture.

Williams has won four caps for Wales since making his debut on last summer's tour of Japan, scoring a try in the 17-7 Millennium Stadium victory over Tonga last November.
