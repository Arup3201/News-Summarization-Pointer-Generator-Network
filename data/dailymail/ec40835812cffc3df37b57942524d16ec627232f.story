Spaghetti: A pizza delivery man told a jury how Alexis Wright, pictured, stripped for him when he delivered her order

A pizza delivery boy told a jury yesterday how the woman at the center of the Zumba prostitution scandal 'made (his) day' when she stripped in front of him and tipped him generously after he delivered spaghetti and meatballs to her door.

The risque details came as a landlord who rented an office to Alexis Wright testified that he became suspicious about her profession when tenants heard 'groaning and moaning' coming from the workspace and claimed he found a box of adult toys and used condoms nearby.

The two men were among the first to give testimony in the trial of Mark Strong Sr., an insurance businessman charged with 13 counts that accuse him of helping the fitness instructor engage in prostitution in the dance studio in Kennebunk, Maine.

Wright, is accused of having sex with scores of local Johns at her studio, an office across the street and at her home. Authorities have said she videotaped clients without their knowledge. She will be tried later.

Christopher West, a landlord who rented office space to Wright, testified he began receiving complaints from other tenants within a couple of weeks. He testified about loud music, moaning, groaning and laughter coming from the office.

He became suspicious when he witnessed men coming and going. He told police he intended to evict Wright but was asked to hold off because of an ongoing investigation.

After police executed a search 
warrant, he said, he discovered a box of adult toys, a bin of used 
condoms and baby wipes and a massage table. An agent seized two video 
cameras, including one that was hidden.

Dan
 Racaniello, manager of a pizza shop next to the studio, testified that 
when he delivered spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread, Wright came
 to the door wearing only a towel, which she dropped to reveal she was 
naked. He said she paid $40 for the $8 meal and told him to keep the 
change.

'She fussed around with her wallet and off goes the towel. I felt awkward,' said Racaniello, who left her apartment stunned by the nudity and the generous tip, saying, 'It made my day.'

Strong and Wright have pleaded not guilty.

Strong helped Wright launch her Pura Vida dance-fitness studio by co-signing for her lease and loaning money with commercial notes that were repaid with interest. He contends he didn't know about allegations of prostitution, and testimony on Thursday indicated that he didn't sign any documents related to the rented office.

Opening statements: Attorney Daniel Lilley, who is representing Mark Strong Sr., gave his opening statements in the Zumba prostitution case in York County Superior Court, Alfred, Maine on Wednesday

Prosecution: York County Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan, pictured, opened the case for the prosecution on Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2013

The defense contends the married 
Strong engaged in bad behavior by having an affair with Wright but 
didn't engage in criminal conduct. Prosecutors, meanwhile, contend 
Strong communicated frequently with Wright about business details via 
video chat, email and text.

The
 case has generated attention because of the size of the operation 
alleged by prosecutors and police and its location in a quaint seaside 
village near Kennebunkport, home of the Bush family's Walker's Point 
summer compound.

A lawyer who has seen a client list says it includes more than 150 names. Law enforcement officials say Wright kept meticulous records suggesting the sex acts generated $150,000 over 18 months.Strong's wife of 30 years and several other family members were in court on Thursday.

Afternoon testimony was delayed by a 
letter sent to attorneys from a law firm representing the town of 
Kennebunk. In the letter, a lawyer said personnel documents cannot be 
released and lawyers were informed that the documents were purged under 
union rules.

The defense contends Strong was targeted by Kennebunk police because he was looking into allegations of unprofessional conduct by its officers. And the defense intends to delve into the background of the lead investigator, including a protective order sought against her and an extramarital affair with her police supervisor that led to a reprimand.

Justice Nancy Mills expressed frustration that prosecutors had been aware of the potential wrinkle for more than a week without telling her.

Delays have plagued the trial. Jury selection was halted twice because of legal action, leaving potential jurors in limbo for weeks before selection was completed and opening statements were delivered on Wednesday.
