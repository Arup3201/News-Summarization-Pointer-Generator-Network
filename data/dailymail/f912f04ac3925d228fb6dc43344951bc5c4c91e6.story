The son of boxing champ Evander Holyfield seems to be following in his father's athletic footsteps.

Elijah Holyfield, a junior at Woodward Academy in College Park, Georgia, has just fielded an offer to play college football for the University of Oregon Ducks.

That's not all either, as Yahoo Sports reports the running back has also received recruitment letters from Arkansas, Boston College, Cal, Duke, Georgia, Louisville, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Ole Miss and Wisconsin, to name just a few.

Athletic genes: Elijah Holyfield (above during a visit to Ohio State) has been recruited to play college football for over 20 major universities

In fact, the young Holyfield is so good, he has been ranked as the No. 137 recruit in the country by ESPN. 

Overall, 22 different colleges have extended offers to the 17-year-old. 

'Oregon Just offered #GoDucks!' Elijah wrote on Twitter yesterday.

Elijah, Evander's only child with ex-wife Dr. Janice Itson, is also a state champion in track. 

And not only is Evander proud of his son, he also seems to think he will be a better athlete than he ever was.

'[My dad] was saying how different it was for me and him,' Elijah told The Oregonian.

'He was picking up, as far as people knowing him, at a later age. At a younger age, he didn't have a lot of money and was a small kid and wasn't that popular. He was saying how different it is for (me), because I'm so young and all the people on me, talking to me all the time – because of him, because of me playing football. He just said to keep a cool head and just remember the main focus.'

Multitalented: Elijah (far right) is also a track star, as his 4 x 100 relay team (above) placed sixth at the Georgia state championship last year

Painful memories: Evander (right) will long be remembered as the only 4-time World Heavyweight Champion, and for having fellow boxer Mike Tyson (left) bite his ear during a fight

Evander made millions over the course of his career, and is still the only 4-time World Heavyweight Champion in the history of boxing.

Despite his huge success, he is perhaps best known to many for an incident in 1996 when fellow boxer Mike Tyson bit off part of his ear during his match.

As for his son, Elijah says he is excited to visit Oregon later this year, but has made no choice yet on what college he might attend. 

'They are always good and looked good against Michigan State this year,' Elijah said of the Ducks. 

'I love the way they run the ball. That's the main thing I'm concerned with.'
