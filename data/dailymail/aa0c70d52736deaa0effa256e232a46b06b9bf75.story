A ‘phenomenal’ competition, Roberto Martinez calls it. The FA Cup endeared him to life in England, he won it against all odds with Wigan and felt this year’s renewal could invigorate Everton.

His view of that famous old pot will not be diminished on Tuesday morning. Just when it seemed Everton’s season was is in steep – possibly terminal – decline, Romelu Lukaku rode to his manager’s rescue, volleying in emphatically from close range in the first minute of injury time.

How Martinez needed that goal. Everton should not be a side talked of in terms of crisis. They are captained by an England international, their midfield included one of the brightest young English stars in the game and quality, from back to front, infuses their squad.

But they were staring down the barrel here, facing a fifth consecutive defeat. James Collins had risen imperiously in the 54th minute to power in a header that destined to set up a fourth round tie against Bristol City or Doncaster. It certainly deserved to.

West Ham, who are due another extended FA Cup run, took their chance when it arrived then worked their socks off to frustrate Everton. Had they won 1-0, there could have been naco complaints but, in this tournament, you can never say never. Martinez, especially, knows that.

‘It would have been a horrendous setback,’ he admitted. ‘We are in a bad run but this showed the dressing room is ready to fight.’

This was rough on Sam Allardyce. The last time he visited Goodison Park, he left in a huff, disgruntled by Martinez’s overrunning press conference that was delaying his flight home and smarting after West Ham had been edged out of a tempestuous clash.

Everton were at their most tenacious that November day, scrapping for every lost cause and chiselling out a victory that left Martinez celebrating more animatedly than normal. That was their seventh unbeaten game and suggested they were ready to motor.

Since then, they have lost all momentum. Any hopes of challenging for a Champions League place again have evaporated on the back of their worst run of results in more than nine years, leading to an increase in tensions and anxieties. This was a game Everton or Martinez could not lose.

For the opening 20 minutes, neither side looked capable of imposing themselves on the tie. West Ham hoisted a couple of high balls in to test the suspect Joel Robles; Everton passed sideways and backwards with little conviction. It was humdrum.

Then, briefly, Everton began to look like the side we have become to expect. Muhamed Besic thundered into a couple of tackles, Ross Barkley began to get on the ball and Lukaku looked like he might unhinge West Ham’s defence.

The best moment arrived in the 25th minute when Barkley, sashaying forward in that powerful yet elegant style of his; a clutch of Claret and Blue shirts scuttled backwards but could not stop him feeding Lukaku, whose shot skidded wide.

It stirred some confidence and Lukaku, whose form has been heavily scrutinised, became a focal point; in the next attack, his ball ushered Steven Naismith forward but, again, the shot fizzed across the face of Adrian’s goal.

Scoring at that point would have lifted the mood. The thing about the Goodison crowd, however, is when the breakthrough does not arrive, they can become fractious and irritable and Everton’s failure to find a way through was not well received.

With Mark Noble scurrying around midfield and Winston Reid and Collins standing firm, Everton lost their rhythm. The groans that accompanied every ball back became louder as the half petered out, so how they emerged for the second period was going to be key.

Being ponderous and cautious would have led groans turning to growls but getting on the front foot had the potential to stir the crowd and, in fairness, Everton started brightly. Kevin Mirallas lobbed an effort just wide, Lukaku had a header chalked off for a foul on Aaron Cresswell.

Yet West Ham were also stirring. Carl Jenkinson had gone close with a drive that Joel Robles did well to turn around and that invited them to press on. Stewart Downing had a shot deflected wide by Sylvain Distin but from the following corner, they made the breakthrough.

Distin, fatally, switched off and stopped tracking Collins, giving him space to inflict maximum damage. He did not waste his chance, powering his header past the stranded Robles. Deficiencies at the back have undermined Everton all year and this was another cheap concession.

Had Enner Valenica took the chance that came his way moments later, Martinez would have felt the full fury of Goodison and it would have been difficult to envisage Everton mounting any kind of fight back. Even at 1-0, the salvage operation looked beyond them.

To their credit, they kept going and just as the board had been held up to show that four minutes of injury time would be played, Bryan Oviedo fizzed a ball across the face of goal, West Ham failed to clear and Lukaku acrobatically grabbed his fourth goal in four games against Allardyce.

‘It was that man again,’ Allardyce said glumly. ‘Every time he plays against us, he scores. Up until then we had kept him quiet. We just can’t let this good performance go to waste. We want to stay in the Cup for as long as we can.’

So does Martinez. He just won’t want it to be such a close run thing again.
