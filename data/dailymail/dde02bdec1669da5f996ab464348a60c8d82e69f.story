Charity dance: Ben Hammond, pictured at the start of his journey, is now in hospital in Yeovil

A fundraiser who was dancing the length of Britain in a yellow-green tutu has halted his charity bid - after being mowed down by a 'drink-driver'.

Flamboyant Ben Hammond was meant to be skipping and twirling from John O'Groats to Land's End to raise awareness of the oppression in Burma.

But he is recovering in hospital today after an alleged drunk driver struck him and his support rider Alice Tanswell.

The two were nearing the town of Polsham, Somerset, at around 10pm on Wednesday when they were struck by a passing car.

Ben, 34, suffered concussion and cuts and bruises while Alice had a minor injuries.

Both were taken to Yeovil Hospital, with Alice discharged and Ben kept in overnight. He is expected to be discharged shortly and will continue with his challenge.

The teacher had been in the final fortnight of his challenge, which has seen him dancing the length of the UK in a neon yellow tutu after setting off on August 13.

Ben, from Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, chose to dance his way down south to show the sort of freedom Brits have which isn't afforded to the people of Burma.

He is hoping to raise Â£50,000 to support the work of Amnesty International, the Burma Campaign UK and LearnBurma.

His mother Judith said: 'He's okay and hopefully will be released from hospital to come back to Bradford-on-Avon to recover.

'He is devastated as he had completed the majority of the journey and was due to finish next week.'

A spokesperson for Dance Britain said Ben was sitting up in hospital and was expected to be released shortly.

She said: 'He's got a pretty bad headache, and lots of bruises. He's got bad cuts on his back and concussion.

'He's
very, very keen to get back on with the dancing, but the trike is 
pretty much a right-off. We're not sure when he'll be back.'

The
teacher was inspired to take up the mission after he taught in a 
refugee camp on the Thai/Burma border and was shocked by the lack of 
freedom the people had.

Alanna
Rugg, 25, has been charged with drinking and driving, failing to stop 
at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident.

She has been bailed to appear at South Somerset Magistrates' Court on October 19.
