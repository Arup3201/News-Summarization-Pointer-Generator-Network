Veteran film director and author Bryan Forbes has died at the age of 86 following a long illness

Veteran film director and author Bryan Forbes has died at the age of 86 following a long illness.

The creator of 1970s classic horror film The Stepford Wives died surrounded by family members at his home in Virginia Water, Surrey.

After working as an actor in London’s West End, Mr Forbes went on to become one of the UK’s most respected directors.

He released a string of hits, including 1961’s Whistle Down the Wind, which he later described as his most popular film.

His varied work was recognised in 2004 when the director was awarded a CBE for services to the arts and the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain.

Mr Forbes counted the late Queen Mother amongst his friends and worked with some of the UK’s most high-profile stars, including Roger Moore, Elton John and Michael Caine.

In an interview with the Daily Mail last June, Mr Forbes revealed that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1975 before doctors later admitted they had made a mistake. 

Born in Stratford, East London, in 1926, Mr Forbes trained as an actor at prestigious drama school RADA before serving in the military for three years.

Following a number of minor acting roles he set up a production company with his friend Richard Attenborough in 1959, only taking charge of Whistle Down the Wind - his first film behind the lens - when an established director was forced to pull out.

Journalist and author Matthew D’Ancona, a family friend, described Mr Forbes as ‘simply irreplaceable’.

He said: ‘Bryan Forbes was a titan of cinema, known and loved by people around the world in the film and theatre industries and known in other fields including politics.

‘He is simply irreplaceable and it is wholly apt that he died surrounded by his family.’

As an actor he appeared in the 1955 film The Colditz Story. He also began to write for the screen, receiving his first full credit for The Cockleshell Heroes in the same year.

In 1964, Forbes wrote and directed Séance on a Wet Afternoon. In 1965 he went to Hollywood to make King Rat.

Forbes was married to actress and Sixties pin-up Nanette Newman, who he wed in 1955 after divorcing his first wife Constance Smith. 

The couple had two daughters, TV presenter Emma Forbes and journalist Sarah Standing.

Over his lengthy career, Mr Forbes juggled a plethora of interests, including owning a bookshop for 37 years that contained 10,000 books.

He was also the president of EMI Elstree studios, wrote a regular column for the Spectator magazine and penned two autobiographies.

Mr Forbes also wrote a number of novels, with his last, The Soldier’s Story, published last year.

Speaking to the Daily Mail last year, the director said his ideal day would be spent with his three granddaughters, India, Tilly and Lily, and said he wanted to be remembered as ‘somebody not taken in by fame’.

A devoted family man, Forbes insisted on a clause being included in any work contract that guaranteed his wife and children would be flown to a location if he was working abroad for longer than three weeks.

Asked how he envisaged his funeral, Mr Forbes said: ‘I’m not very religious so I’d be happy for family and friends to remember my good bits, scatter my ashes in the garden and plant a tree in my memory.’
