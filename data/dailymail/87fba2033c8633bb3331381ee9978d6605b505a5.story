Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova continued to make amends for an upset first-round loss last year at the Australian Open with a 6-2, 6-4 second-round win  over Mona Barthel.

Fourth-seeded Kvitova held her serve in the sixth game of the second set through nine deuces, then broke Barthel in the ninth, helped when the German player served a double-fault on break point.

Kvitova, who won her second Wimbledon title last July, next plays American Madison Keys, who beat Casey Dellacqua in three sets.
