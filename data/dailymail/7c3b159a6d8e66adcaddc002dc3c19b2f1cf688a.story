Lawyer Phil Shiner's Public Interest Lawyers are representing Iraqi witnesses accused of fabricating claims that prisoners were tortured

Iraqis conspired to claim that British troops executed and tortured prisoners to secure huge compensation payouts, a public inquiry heard on Wednesday.

Detainees and families of the dead allegedly colluded to pervert the course of justice by insisting UK soldiers murdered, mutilated and mistreated captives.

In a closing statement to the Al Sweady Inquiry, lawyers for the troops and Ministry of Defence said accusations of war crimes were ‘manifestly untrue’.

Iraqi witnesses – represented by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers – ‘dishonestly’ fabricated claims because of an ‘ulterior motive in the form of financial compensation’, they said.

The inquiry is examining allegations that British troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others at Camp Abu Naji near Basra in May 2004.

It followed a ferocious firefight with insurgents dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, named after a checkpoint.

But after a year-long hearing costing taxpayers £23million, the case sensationally fell apart last month when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence in a central claim – that insurgents were murdered.

It provoked outrage that British troops were accused of the most serious crimes by publicly-funded lawyers. Neil Garnham QC, of Treasury Solicitors, which represented many UK personnel, said evidence of mistreatment by the Iraqis could not be trusted because they had persistently ‘lied and exaggerated’.

Their allegations, including claims they were beaten, faced mock executions and witnessed captives being stabbed, were ‘implausible, confused and inconsistent’, he added.

The Iraqis were involved in a 
‘deliberate and co-ordinated attempt... to deceive the inquiry’ into 
believing UK troops had tortured and killed prisoners’, he said. The 
Ministry of Defence’s closing submissions said the claims had caused 
soldiers’ ‘immense anxiety and distress’.

It
 added: ‘The untruthful allegations cannot be attributed to honest 
mistakes or misunderstandings. They are the product of a conspiracy 
between a number of the Iraqi core participants to pervert the course of
 justice.’

It admitted there were ‘some instances’ where British soldiers had fallen short of expected standards, such as a detainee being shouted at, slapped and being restrained incorrectly. But lawyers for the Iraqis said there were still numerous ‘grave’ claims of abuse for the inquiry to consider.

Patrick O’Connor QC said: ‘They are gross violations of the Geneva Conventions, inhuman and degrading treatment of wounded, broken and helpless young men, who were utterly at the mercy of their military handlers and interrogators.’

The Iraqis allege troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took bloody revenge for the massacre of six Royal Military policemen a year earlier. The MoD insists the men were insurgents killed in battle.

Mr Shiner’s Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers has received around £3million in public money for the inquiry, named after Hameed Al Sweady, 19, who died in the incident.

His firm made its name pursuing British soldiers through the courts over alleged war crimes in Iraq. Clients include relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in British custody in 2003.
