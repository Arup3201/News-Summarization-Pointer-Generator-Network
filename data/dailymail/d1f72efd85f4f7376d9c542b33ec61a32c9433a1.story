Fiery temperament: Baby sitter Martha Dreher, 57, has been charged with felony first-degree arson in connection to the August 9 inferno

A 57-year-old Texas baby sitter has been accused of intentionally setting a man's Austin house on fire in retaliation for the children’s bad behavior.

Fire department investigators charged Martha Carolyn Dreher with felony first-degree arson Thursday in connection to the August 9 inferno.

According to investigators, Dreher typically took care of Glenn Williams' preteen daughters, but they were on vacation with their dad during the incident.

On the night of the fire, officials said Ms Dreher was watching the man’s 5-year-old twin boys in their mother's house but told them she needed to stop by Williams' residence in the 7900 block of RM 2222 to 'grab popcorn.'

The fire was set at around 9pm on one of the girl's beds in the 30 minutes Dreher was inside, according to investigators.

A surveillance video captured Dreher driving away from the house as flames began ravaging the structure, according to court documents obtained by Austin American Statesman. 

Mr Williams' twins were in their nanny's car at the time and were unharmed.

The homeowner’s older son, who was out having dinner when the blaze ignited, returned after midnight and discovered his sisters' rooms in shambles and the house smelling like smoke and lighter fluid.

Inferno: The blaze broke out inside the bedrooms occupied by Glenn Williams' pre-teen daughters on this block of RM 2222 in Austin, Texas

Responding officers later discovered broken eggs on the floor and bed of one of the targeted rooms.

‘It was definitely a vendetta against the two girls,’ Glenn Williams told ABC News. 

When interviewed by police, Ms Dreher said she had informed Glenn Williams that she would no longer look after his daughters after they returned from vacation because the girls were 'out of control, lacking respect' and 'having discipline issues.'

The woman also told fire investigators that when she stopped off at the house for popcorn, she never saw flames, but she did notice light in one of the bedrooms.

The 57-year-old Martha Dreher could face 99 years in prison if convicted of first-degree arson. She was released on bond Thursday after pleading not guilty.

The family will now be forced to gut their heavily damaged 90-year-old home.
