Former Tory MP Patrick Mercer said he was 'ashamed' as he announced he was to quit Parliament

The cash-for-questions scandal which forced Patrick Mercer to quit the Commons was the worst the Commons watchdog had seen, it emerged today.

The ex-Tory minister was accused of using his position in parliament ‘for his own gain’ after agreeing to take money in return for tabling questions in Parliament the Commons.

He quit his Newark seat in disgrace on Tuesday, ahead of today’s report which also criticised him for using ‘racially offensive language’.

Mr Mercer, a former army officer, dramatically ended his political career by quitting the Commons after learning he was to be suspended for six months.

He resigned from the Tory party in July after he was exposed as having accepted £4,000 to ask Parliamentary questions and lobby on behalf of Fiji.

He referred himself to Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and promised to quit the Commons at the next election.

But it emerged that the standards watchdog was to recommend he be kicked out for six months, and he resigned on Tuesday night.

The report said Mr Mercer ‘deliberately evaded’ rules and ‘inflicted significant reputational damage’ on Parliament.

The suspension the Standards Committee had planned to impose on the former Army colonel would have been the longest it had meted out to an MP since 1947, with the exception former Labour MP Denis MacShane, who was convicted of criminal offences.

Its report stated: ‘We are not aware of a case relating to a sitting MP which has involved such a sustained and pervasive breach of the House's rules on registration, declaration and paid advocacy.’

The by-election sparked by his decision to quit the Nottinghamshire seat will be held on June 5.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday ruled out standing in the seat himself, claiming he wanted to focus on the European Parliament elections on May 22.

The damning report said Mr Mercer, a former Tory minister, had used his position in parliament 'for his own gain'

The investigation found Mr Mercer was ‘willing to use his parliamentary position for his own gain’ and readily signed an agreement for consultancy services but failed to register it or declare his interest when tabling relevant parliamentary questions.

Mr Mercer was also criticised for using ‘racially offensive language’ in relation to footage that showed him talking about a visit to Israel where he told an 18-year-old girl ‘you look like a bloody Jew’.

When he was asked about the incident during the investigation, Mr Mercer said he had been ‘very tired at the time’ and admitted it had been a ‘stupid thing to say’, the report said.

Mr Mercer had added: ‘I am married to a woman of Jewish extraction. I have lots of friends in the Jewish community, and, yes, I can prostrate myself no further, it's just a stupid thing to say, and I didn't even...

I accept I said it, and I am conscious that my speech isn't always as balanced as it should be.’

The committee said it had come to the conclusion that Mr Mercer's dealings with the fake public affairs consultants ‘were motivated by the desire for commercial gain’.

Its report adds: ‘We agree with the commissioner's conclusion that, in allowing payment to influence his actions in parliamentary proceedings, in failing to declare his interests on appropriate occasions, in failing to recognise that his actions were not in accordance with his expressed views on acceptable behaviour, in repeatedly denigrating fellow members both individually and collectively, and in using racially offensive language, Mr Mercer inflicted significant reputational damage on the House and its members.’
