British television is being bought wholesale by greedy American corporations, the head of Channel 4 has warned.

The channel's chief executive David Abraham said billionaire media tycoons and production companies want to invest in this country to avoid tax in the US.

ITV could one day be owned entirely by shareholders based across the Atlantic while our favourite shows could be produced by internet giants such as Netflix and Google, he said.

Giving the annual MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, Mr Abraham called on politicians to do more to protect the UK television industry from overseas interference.

In a swipe at Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey, who gave the same lecture last year, he said: 'In recent years we've seen a parade of Americans standing up here at the MacTaggart telling us how things ought to be done.

'But how do you explain the number of US entities queuing up to buy our producers and now our broadcasters?

'Doesn't this suggest that maybe as with our gun laws and health system it's us who are showing them how it ought to be done?'

Mr Abraham said the UK's public service broadcasters - the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 - have 'created the best conditions for creative programme-making on the planet'.

Using the BBC's 1990 political thriller House of Cards – which has recently been remade by Spacey – as an example, he said: 'Would Netflix, for example, have bought a show about a murderous politician who broke the fourth wall of drama if the BBC hadn't taken that risky decision, decades before?'

Mr Abraham warned that US investors are buying up our channels and production companies in a modern equivalent of the 19th century 'gold rush'.

He cited the U.S. remake of the political thriller House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey as an example

Earlier this year, American media giant Viacom bought Channel 5 for £450million from Richard Desmond, and Liberty Global – owned by billionaire mogul John Malone – bought a 6.4 per cent stake in ITV.

Mr Abraham said: '[Malone is] understood to be the largest landowner in America, was nicknamed 'Darth Vader' by Al Gore, currently holds a net debt of $41billion and famously, hates to pay tax.'

He added: 'US media companies [are] eager to stay ahead of each other by internationalising their revenues…and shielding their tax exposure.'

Mr Abraham warned that American companies such as Google – which has started producing set-top boxes – may not have the interests of UK viewers at heart.

He said: 'What level of accountability and responsibility are we prepared to expect from platforms that operate across technical and geographical boundaries?

'And how could we expect people whose idea of a good time is a 24-hour code-athon, to relate to the needs of the UK television audience?'
