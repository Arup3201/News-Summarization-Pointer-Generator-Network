President Obama last night gave the clearest sign yet that the federal government has no intention of challenging those states which voted to legalize the recreational use and sale of marijuana.

Speaking to ABC News' Barbara Walters, the President said that the prosecution of recreational marijuana users in states that have legalized the substance won't be a ‘top priority’ for federal law enforcement officials in the war on drugs.

‘We've got bigger fish to fry,' said the President, who was speaking about cannabis for the first time since Colorado and Washington voted to legalize it.

Speaking to ABC News' Barbara Walters, President Obama has given the clearest signal yet that federal government has no intention of challenging those states which voted to legalize marijuana

The President was interviewed by Barbara Walters as one of her most fascinating people of 2012

‘It would not make sense for us to see a
top priority as going after recreational users in states that have 
determined that it's legal,’ he told Walters in a 20/20 interview which airs Friday night.

Although the sale and use of marijuana is in defiance of federal law, the president's comments are the strongest suggestion yet that he plans to adopt a 'hands-off' approach, similar to that taken toward users of medicinal marijuana in the 18 states where it is legal.

Marijuana remains classified under the Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule I narcotic whose cultivation, distribution, possession and use are criminal acts. It is in the same category as heroin, LSD and Ecstasy all deemed to have high potential for abuse.

Obama told Walters he does not - ‘at this point’ – support the widespread legalization of marijuana. But he cited shifting public opinion and limited government resources as reasons to find a middle ground on punishing use of the drug.

‘This is a tough problem, because Congress has not yet changed the law,’ Obama said.

'I head up the executive branch; we're supposed to be carrying out laws. And so what we're going to need to have is a conversation about, How do you reconcile a federal law that still says marijuana is a federal offense and state laws that say that it's legal?'

Attorney General Eric Holder and the Justice Department have been asked by the president to examine the legal questions surrounding conflicting state and federal laws on drugs.

'There are a number of issues that have to be considered, among them the impact that drug usage has on young people, [and] we have treaty obligations with nations outside the United States,' said Holder on Wednesday.

As a politician, Obama has always opposed legalizing marijuana and downplayed his personal history with the substance.

Obama wrote in his 1995 memoir, ‘Dreams from My Father,’ that he would smoke pot regularly with his high school buddies who formed the ‘Choom Gang’ - slang for smoking marijuana.

Further details about the president's dope-smoking days as a high school student in the 1970s were revealed by biographer David Maraniss in his book, Barack Obama: The Story, published in June.

Called Barry by his friends, the future president 'was known for starting a few pot-smoking trends', including one called 'total absorption.' The rules of TA stated that if you exhaled early, 'you were assessed a penalty and your turn was skipped the next time the joint came around'.

'Wasting good bud smoke was not tolerated,' an old school friend told the author.

And if that rule didn't give enough of an insight into how much Obama loved his marijuana, Maraniss goes on to reveal he was known for his 'interceptions' when a joint was being passed around.

'He often elbowed his way in, out of turn, shouted "intercepted", and took an extra hit,' he writes.The anecdotes are from Obama's time studying at Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii and Occidental College in Los Angeles.

‘There are a bunch of things I did that I regret when I was a kid,’ Obama told Walters. ‘My attitude is, substance abuse generally is not good for our kids, not good for our society.

‘I want to discourage drug use,’ he added.

Colorado and Washington are the first states to legalize recreational use of marijuana. In both states, pot use remains illegal 
in public. Eighteen states have approved the use of marijuana for 
medicinal use with a doctor's order. Federal law still prohibits all use
and sale of marijuana.

Barbara Walters' exclusive first joint, post-election interview with President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama airs Friday night on 20/20 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.

The prosecution of cannabis users won't be a 'top priority', he told Barbara Walters

Both Colorado and Washington voted on Nov. 7 to legalize the recreational use and sale 
of pot in defiance of federal law

The president suggests he will take a similar approach to that already adopted towards medicinal marijuana users in 18 states where it's legal
