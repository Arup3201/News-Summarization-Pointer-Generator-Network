Home Secretary Theresa May wants to make terror suspects 'stateless' by removing their UK citizenship

Terror suspects would be stripped of their British citizenship and made ‘stateless’ under plans drawn up by Theresa May.

The Home Secretary wants to find a way around international rules which mean someone cannot be left without citizenship of any country.

The move comes as she faces fresh pressure over the disappearance of suspects placed under terrorism prevention and investigation measures (Tpims).

Fugitive Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, who was subject to a TPIM, was last seen fleeing a London mosque in a burka 10 days ago.

Labour’s Yvette Cooper has written to Mrs May urging her to re-introduce powers previously available under control orders, to forcibly move a suspect across the country.

Mohamed was relocated to Ipswich, in Suffolk, when he was subject to a control order but returned to London when the restriction was lifted.

Another Tpim subject and abscondee Ibrahim Magag who vanished in a black cab on Boxing Day last year but had been forced to live in the West Country.

However, as part of wider reforms Mrs May reportedly wants to be able to remove terror suspects from Britain altogether by removing their British citizenship.

At least 20 terror suspects have had their British passports torn up on national security grounds to stop them entering the country, it emerged today.

In the two years to February this year, Mrs May stripped British citizenship from 16 individuals who had dual nationality considered to pose a threat to the UK.

Rules in place for a decade allow ministers to act to revoke passports in a bid to target the so-called ‘enemy within’.

At least five of the 16 to lose their citizenship under the coalition were born in Britain.  One man had lived in the UK for five decades.

The Home Office said: 'The government will take all necessary steps to protect the public, including pursuing deprivation of citizenship, where appropriate.'

Mrs May wants the power to take a UK passport from anybody whose conduct is seriously prejudicial to the interests of the UK, sources said.

Warning: Labour's Yvette Cooper has called for a return to rule which mean terror suspects can be sent to different parts of the UK

But Labour’s shadow immigration minister
 David Hanson said: ‘Theresa May needs to concentrate on stopping people
 absconding in taxis instead we get suggested changes that could take 
years, will undoubtedly be legally questioned and won't help with the 6 
terror suspects being allowed off TPIMs in 2 months time because she 
insisted on having an arbitrary time limit.

‘It isn't these smokescreens we need from the Home Secretary its rapid action to plug the gaps in her own terror control regime.’

It has been reported that ministers are reviewing Tpims and are considering whether to prohibit suspects from visiting mosques suspected of preaching hardline religious views.

It is also understood Tpims could be tweaked to allow suspects to be relocated to parts of their home cities away from where known associates live

Shadow home secretary Ms Cooper said in a letter to Mrs May: ‘No terror suspect under a relocation order ever managed to abscond.

‘Now two terror suspects who were previously relocated and then returned because of your decision have absconded.

‘Your decision, against advice and warnings, to end relocations has made it much easier for two dangerous men to disappear.’

Ms Cooper asks the Home Secretary to agree to re-introduce the power to relocate terror suspects and pledges ‘cross party’ support.
