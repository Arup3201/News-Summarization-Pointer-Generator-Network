U.S. Rep. John Conyers, the second most senior Democrat in the House of Representatives, lost his appeal Friday to get on the August primary ballot after Michigan election officials found problems with more than half of the Democrat's nominating petitions.

The Secretary of State's office affirmed a decision by Detroit-area election officials to keep Conyers off the ballot since he only submitted 455 valid signatures from registered voters in his heavily Democratic district.

At least 1,000 are needed to qualify for the primary ballot, and they must also be collected by registered voters. Most of Conyers' were not.

The decision does not necessarily end Conyers' 50-year career in Congress as his campaign manager has said Conyers would mount a write-in effort if necessary.

Why the long face? Rep. John Conyers will have to run for re-election as a wrote-in candidate after 50 years in Congress after signature gatherers screwed up

One foot out the door? Conyers (R), a 25-term congressman, may have to run as a write-in candidate if he wants to stay in the House of Representatives

Conyers is known for his unapologetic liberal stripes, but worked alongside some Republicans as well, including the late Rep. Henry Hyde (R) when they were their parties' top dogs on the House Judiciary Committee -- they're shown here sparring gently over the rules for President Bill Clinton's impeachment hearings

There is precedent in Michigan for such an effort. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan launched a successful write-in campaign in last year's primary after his name was kept off the ballot due to a residency issue.

Conyers also has mounted a legal challenge to have the Michigan election law at the heart of the dispute declared unconstitutional, and a federal judge is expected to rule later Friday.

'The Secretary of State made her decision, and we'll live with it,' said Bert Johnson, Conyers' campaign chair and a Democratic state senator. 'Obviously, we disagree, and we'll wait for the federal court to rule.'

Conyers, 85, had appealed to Secretary of State Ruth Johnson after Wayne County officials said there were problems with some people who collected signatures. The circulators weren't registered to vote or had listed a wrong registration address.

That can spoil petitions, under Michigan law, and as a result Conyers lacked the 1,000 signatures necessary to get on the ballot.

Johnson said Friday that she had no choice but to 'enforce the circulator registration requirement as written.'

Big winner: Rev. Horace Sheffield (L) is running in the Democratic primary that will no longer see Conyers on the ballot

Conyers, now 85, has been in Congress for five decades and represents a staunchly Democratic district

'A circulator's failure to register is a fatal defect that renders all signatures appearing on a petition he or she circulated invalid,' her review said Friday.

Ending Conyers' career that way would be 'pretty outrageous,' his lawyer, John Pirich, said this week.

Political opponents said Conyers should follow election procedures like other candidates. An attorney for a Democratic challenger, the Rev. Horace Sheffield III, said Conyers for decades had no problem following the law.

'In essence, they played the game, lost and then complained that the rules were unfair,' Eric Doster said, quoting a Virginia judge.
