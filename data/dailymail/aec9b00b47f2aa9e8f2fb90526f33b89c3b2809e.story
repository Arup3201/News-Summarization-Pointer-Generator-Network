Foreign Secretary William Hague told of his 'grave concerns' over how the Zimbabwean election was conducted after it was confirmed Robert Mugabe has won another five-year presidential term.

Zimbabwe election officials said this afternoon that Mugabe, 89, won the presidential election with 61 per cent of the vote, compared to 33 per cent for challenger Morgan Tsvangirai.

The result infuriated Tsvangirai, who claimed the election had been stolen by Mugabe's Zanu-PF and claimed it was a ‘huge farce’ and ‘null and void’.

He said the result had plunged the country into a constitutional crisis, saying his MDC party would no longer deal with Zanu-PF.

His party vowed to ‘exhaust all legal remedies’ to overturn Mugabe’s landslide  victory and claimed that electoral rolls contained thousands of fake names and that many MDC voters had been prevented from registering.

Hague this evening also expressed concern over the election, 
which has been plagued by claims of widespread fraud and vote-rigging.

In a statement released by the Foreign
Office, Mr Hague said: 'People around the world are watching events in 
Zimbabwe, following the announcement by the Zimbabwean Electoral 
Commission that President Mugabe has won the presidential elections, as 
well as the indications of possible legal challenges.

'I commend the people of Zimbabwe on 
holding peaceful elections. However we have grave concerns over the 
conduct of the election.

'The preliminary statements of the 
African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC) 
observation missions, and those of the domestic observer groups, have 
outlined many of these significant concerns, and I hope that their final
assessments of the elections will take into account the full impact of 
these irregularities on the outcome.'

Officials confirmed that Zanu-PF had won 158 seats in the 210-member chamber.

Responding to Tsvangirai’s claims, Zanu-PF spokesman  Patrick Chinamasa said : ‘My plea to him is to have recourse in the courts. 

‘He should feel free to employ the best lawyers.’

Tsvangirai's party said yesterday it 
has had calls from supporters to take to the streets in protest and was 
assessing reports that Mugabe's loyalist military and police were 
planning a clampdown and arrests of its party leaders.

The
Movement for Democratic Change said Friday it rejected the observations
of African monitors that glossed over 'monumental fraud' by state 
security agents and Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. The mood in some urban 
strongholds of the MDC was muted.

But the African Union dismissed complaints of fraud, while another observer urged all parties to ‘accept hard facts’.

The 89-year-old president has been Zimbabwe’s ruler since independence from Britain in 1980.

Olusegan Obasanjo, head of the African Mission, admitted there were ‘incidents which could have been avoided’ but said these would not have altered the overall outcome of the poll.

He said his monitors noted some apparent irregularities but that they did not constitute evidence of systematic tampering.

Mugabe's supporters have rejected allegations of rigging and claimed victory. Wednesday's contentious vote has created fresh uncertainty in a country long afflicted by division and economic turmoil.

‘Yes, the election is free,’ Obasanjo said. He described the vote as credible unless any evidence to the contrary emerges, and asked election authorities to investigate reports that tens of thousands of eligible voters were turned away.

Another poll monitoring group in Zimbabwe said as many as 1 million of the more than 6 million eligible voters were prevented from casting ballots.

‘If 25 per cent were not allowed, then, yes, the election is fatally flawed,’ said Obasanjo, a former Nigerian president.

The head of the observer mission for the Southern African Development Community, a regional body, described the election Wednesday as ‘very free’ and ‘very peaceful’.

But, he noted that there were some violations and a full analysis was still under way. It was too early to describe the vote as ‘fair’, he said

Tanzania's foreign minister  Bernard Membe  said: ‘The question of fairness is broad and you cannot answer it within one day.

‘And so be sure that within 30 days, through our main report, the question of fairness may come.’ Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe's main opponent in the presidential vote, has declared the election ‘null and void.’

Mugabe's ZANU-PF party said Friday that poll returns showed that 3.9 million voters cast their ballots on Wednesday.

That 61 percent turnout was higher than in an uncontested referendum on a new constitution in March where no disputed voters' lists were used and only national citizens' identity documents were needed.

Mugabe's Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa said Friday his party was ‘headed for an unprecedented landslide.’

‘If anyone is dissatisfied, the courts are there. I invite Tsvangirai to go to court if he has any grounds to justify what he has been saying,’ Chinamasa told reporters.

Under the law, seven days were set aside for legal challenges, with another two days for rulings to be made and then the swearing in of a new government takes place.

Obasanjo said voting itself was peaceful but the observers noted ‘incidences that could have been avoided and even tended to have breached the law.’

Independent election monitors have alleged many people were unable to vote because of disorganized voters' lists and a chaotic program to register electors on those lists in the run-up to polling day.

Obasanjo said some apparent irregularities were made in error largely after funding for the vote was late in coming from the nation's depleted state coffers.

‘I have never seen an election that is perfect,’ he said. ‘The process continues and we have to limit our comments.’

Aisha Abdullahi, the African Union's commissioner for political affairs, said observers reported that Zimbabwe had made improvements in the conduct of elections since the last violent and disputed elections in 2008 that led regional leaders to forge a shaky coalition between Mugabe and Tsvangirai, the former opposition leader.

But she said they expressed ‘grave concerns’ over voters' lists this time that were not made available in time for inspection and verification by voters, contesting parties and candidates. Public scrutiny of the voters' roll was of vital ‘strategic importance’ to verify the accuracy of the contents and establish correct numbers of eligible electors, she said.

She said the electoral commission printed 8.7 million ballot papers for 6.4 million voters, or 35 per cent above the number of registered voters against the international standard of 5 to 10 per cent. Observers said a significant number of ballot booklets had missing ballot papers and papers without serial numbers.

They also expressed ‘great concern’ over the high numbers of voters turned away.

The late publicity on the location of voting stations just 48 hours before stations opened contributed also to voters who failed to cast ballots because they were not at correct polling sites.

Abdullahi said observers reported a high number of disabled, elderly or other ‘assisted voters’ being helped to cast their ballots by polling officers who may have influenced them against their free will. In some outlying stations, one-quarter of voters were helped this way.

She said some AU observers are to remain in Zimbabwe until August 14.
