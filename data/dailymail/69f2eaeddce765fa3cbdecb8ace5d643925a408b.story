Roy Keane has revealed that Sir Alex Ferguson took him to task over his drinking while he was playing for Manchester United.

The legendary Old Trafford captain is frank about his alcohol consumption during his early years at United in his autobiography The Second Half.

Keane also details his battles with former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, reacting to the iconic manager's criticism in his own book last year.

Keane, now assistant manager at Aston Villa, says he and Ferguson often had arguments

One topic to spark disagreement between the two United legends was Keane's fondness for drink - which the Irishman admitted was his 'hobby' during his early Old Trafford career.

Asked by ShortList magazine if Ferguson ever had words over his drinking, Keane said: 'Oh, of course. And quite rightly.

'This idea that me and Ferguson just had one bust up right at the end… We had loads! We had disagreements about my drinking, as fans are happy to report you if you’re spotted out at 3am. 

'But if we had a game on a Wednesday and the manager said to me, “I heard you were out Sunday night,” I’d say, “Yeah, I go out Sundays.” I was single, I was 21. I wasn’t a golfer. 

'Drinking was my hobby, I suppose. I’m not giving it the thumbs up, but it was my trait. I don’t know why – because I’m Irish, maybe, because I lived by myself. Boredom kicked in.'

And Keane, who said he hadn't read his former boss's book, reiterated his view on Ferguson's criticism of him.

'It wasn’t my thing to be pals with him, but at some stage we must have had massive respect for each other,' he said.

'Even when I left, I think we both felt it was right for Manchester United. But things were said about me when I left that I felt were out of order.'
