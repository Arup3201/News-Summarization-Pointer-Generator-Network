An explosive new report claims New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez courted a married newspaper publisher and  took her on an exclusive beach vacation to the home of his friend, the then-governor of Puerto Rico.

The New York Post reports that photos provided to the newspaper show Menendez, 59, and Cecilia Reynolds enjoying a getaway on the island.

One picture shows Ms Reynolds, 50, sitting naked on a beach and smiling at the camera 'suggestively,' according to the Post.

Businesswoman: Ms Reynolds, who runs a Spanish-language newspaper, is seen here during an official meeting at Menendez's office

Other pictures show the pair posing, Menendez's arm wrapped around Ms Reynold's waist, at a waterfall at a Puerto Rican national park.

An anonymous source is said to have handed over the information to the Post, as well as the National Legal and Policy Center, a Virginia-based conservative watchdog group.

The source said the trip took place in 2007 when Ms Reynolds, a mother of two, was married to her husband Matt Reynolds.

Ms Reynolds, who is still with Mr Reynolds, said in a statement that she and her husband were separated 'for a period of time in the past.'

However, she add: 'Any and all allegations being peddled by a former disgruntled business partner are false and malicious.'

Married: Ms Reynolds was married at the time of the trip, though she says she had been separated from her husband Matt Reynolds for 'a period of time.' The 50-year-old businesswoman has two children

The powerful Democratic senator released a statement on Friday saying: 'These are the same kind of questionably timed smear tactics that we’ve seen before, and we’re not going to dignify them with a comment.'

Menendez divorced his schoolteacher wife, the mother of his two children, in 2005.

Close ties: The couple reportedly stayed at the home of Former Puerto Rico governor Anibal Acevedo Vila

Ms Reynolds is the owner of the Spanish language newspaper Nostros, which circulates in three New Jersey counties.

The Post reports that the allegations of an affair reveal that he maintained a close relationship to the governor of Puerto Rico at the time, Anibal Acevedo Vila.

At the time, Acevedo Vila was under investigation by the U.S. Attorney for Puerto Rico and was later charged with 19 counts related to campaign finance fraud.

Acevdeo Vila lost a re-election campaign 
in 2008. A judge later dismissed 15 of the charges against him. A jury 
acquitted him of the remaining four charges.

The Post reports that Menendez and Reynolds stayed at Acevedo Vila's secluded beachfront home during their getaway.

At the same time, Menendez was reportedly working to block the appointment of Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, the interim U.S. Attorney who was investigating Acevdeo Vila, according to the Newark Star-Ledger.

'Menendez apparently sees no ethics problem with taking his married girlfriend to the Puerto Rico governor’s beach house while the governor was under federal investigation, and published reports describe Menendez as putting a senatorial hold on the nomination of the US attorney who was to oversee the investigation,' Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, told the Post.

'Is there any wonder the public has such a low opinion of elected officials?'

Menendez, a leader in the Senate immigration fight, is being investigated by a federal grand jury over his relationship with a Florida ophthalmologist, a wealthy donor. He is accused of using his power to help steer contractors toward Dr Salomon Melgen's business interests, the Washington Post reports.
