A video has emerged of NFL offensive lineman Richie Incognito using the N-word during a profane tirade at a bar.

The footage, taken by fans, comes just says after the 30-year-old player was suspended by the Miami Dolphins over allegations that he launched a racist tirade against young teammate Jonathan Martin and bullied him.

Multiple reports indicate that Incognito will lose his job over the charges and never play for the Dolphins again.

Rant: An obscenity-laced video of Richie Incognito has emerged in which he uses the N-word when greeting a teammate

Richie Incognito, left, may have been acting under orders from his coaches to 'toughen up' Jonathan Martin, right, when he subjected his teammate to a torrent of abusive voice mail and texts messages

The video, obtained by TMZ, shows a shirtless Incognito bounding around a bar yelling excitedly.

At one point he shouts at teammate and fellow offensive lineman Mike Pouncey: 'Mike Pouncey, n***a!'

He parades around the bar and shouts again: 'Mike Pouncey, motherf*****!'

Pouncey, who is black, can be seen laughing as he watches his teammate.

TMZ says the footage was shot at a team outing in Miami earlier this year.

CBS Sports reports that Incognito sent Martin, 24, a series of harassing and threatening text messages, including one that referred to him as a ‘half-n*****.’ Martin is biracial.

In the messages Incognito also threatens to defecate in Martin's mouth and promises to track down his family and harm them.

The Miami Herald reports that Incognito will be fired for 'conduct detrimental to the team.' He is on the last year of a three-year, $13million contract.

The NFL is conducting an in-depth investigation into the allegations made by Martin, which include bullying, hazing and taunting by nearly the entire team. 

The Stanford-education Martin took a leave from the team last year to undergo counseling.

Over the weekend it was alleged that almost all the veteran Dolphins players have forced newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles 
including $30,000 dinners.

According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald on Sunday, the alleged bank-rolling is partly the reason for Martin's shock leave of absence from the team.

ESPN
claims Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to 
help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. 
However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter.

ESPN's Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefter released a report regarding Incognito on ESPN.com, saying that several sources insisted Incognito was involved.

They said the incident was not isolated and extended to 2012, when Martin was a second-round draft pick by the team.

One source said any emotional issues Martin is experiencing are directly related to his harassment.

Reporter Adam Schefter tweeted on Monday some of Incognito's alleged messages to Martin

On
Friday, Dolphins coach Joe Philbin said, 'This is something we take 
very seriously and will not be tolerated'.

Incognito has been playing with the 
Dolphins since 2010 and has been in the NFL since 2006, originally with 
the St. Louis Rams. He was selected to the Pro Bowl just last season as 
an offensive guard.

Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke.

Reporter
Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab 
for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around 
$400.000.'

Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation.

'Everything tastes better when 
rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I 
just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight.'
