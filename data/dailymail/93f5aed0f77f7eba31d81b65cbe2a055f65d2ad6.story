The body of a British tycoon who plunged to his death from a fourth-floor window was identified by his brother-in-law, an inquest heard today.

Scot Young, 52, was found impaled on railings after plummeting 60ft from his £3million penthouse in Montagu Square in Marylebone, London, on December 8.

An inquest into his death today heard how his brother-in-law Guy van Ristell formally identified his body at Westminster Public Mortuary. 

The hearing, at Westminster Coroner's Court, also heard how his daughter Sasha Young provided background details for registration of the body.

Prior to his death, Mr Young - one of Britain's wealthiest men - was embroiled in a vicious divorce battle with ex-wife Michelle, 49, who claimed he had hidden his huge wealth from investigators.

There has been speculation that Russian gangland groups were involved in his horrific death, after he reportedly ran into financial trouble with them. 

However, a packed public gallery heard today how detectives have dismissed claims the bankrupt entrepreneur died as part of a plot involving his connections to Russian oligarchs.

The inquest into his death was opened this morning and adjourned until next month.

Coroner's officer Rosalin Thompson said: 'Identification was made by his brother-in-law Guy van Ristell and details were provided by his daughter Sasha Young for registration.

'On Monday, December 8, this gentleman was found impaled on railings outside [his home in] Montagu Square with multiple injuries.

'He was pronounced dead at the scene.

'Police are not treating this death as suspicious'

Adjourning the inquest, Angela Hodes, Westminster assistant coroner, said: 'I will open the inquest touching the death of Scott Guy Young who died on December 8 and I will adjourn that for a coroners review on January 12, 2015.'

In the wake of the Dundee-born entrepreneur's death, figures close to Mr Young speculated that his death was not suicide.

Scotland Yard insists Mr Young's death is not suspicious but it has emerged that at least six of his friends have died in strange circumstances in the past 10 years.

At the weekend, it was revealed that Mr Young, originally from Dundee, once worked for wealthy Dundee licensee Alex Brown, 60, who was found drowned near his luxury yacht in Malaga in 2006.

Police probed claims from Brown's family that he may have been murdered after he was seen arguing with a man on the harbour's edge.

Lawyer Stephen Curtis was killed when his new helicopter crashed in 2004. Curtis was an associate of oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who also died in mysterious circumstances last year.

Johnny Elichaoff, 55, fell to his death from a shopping centre last month. 

Meanwhile, Robert Curtis, 47, and Paul Castle, 54, fell to their deaths under Tube trains in 2010 and 2012 respectively. 

There have been allegations that the property mogul was killed after falling foul of Russian mobsters following disputes over cash.

However, Scotland Yard has insisted it is not treating his death as suspicious. 

Mr Young was engaged to 29-year-old American fashion designer and TV presenter Noelle Reno. He had two daughters from his previous relationship.

He was involved in a lengthy and bitter High Court divorce battle with his ex-wife for a share of his claimed fortune.

Michelle had demanded £300million from her former husband, who she married in 1995 claiming he was worth 'a few billion'.

Mr Young, a 'deal fixer' for the super-rich, lived a playboy lifestyle, travelling in private jets, driving supercars and with an international property portfolio.

He was said to have counted some of Britain's richest and most powerful figures among his friends, including Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky.

It is claimed Mr Young made his fortune in the 1990s on the back of a telecoms deal and property ventures, amassing a £2billion fortune.

However, he was left bankrupt following a Moscow property deal.

Last November, his ex-wife was awarded a £20million settlement and £6million in legal costs after seven years of wrangling.

Mrs Young - who had demanded £300million - called the vast sum a disgrace and insisted her ex-husband was still worth billions.

He had previously been ordered to pay his ex-wife more than £20,000-a-month in maintenance, and had a six-month stint in jail after refusing to co-operate with investigations trying to track down his fortune.
