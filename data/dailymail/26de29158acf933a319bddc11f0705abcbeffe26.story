Many would argue that Liverpool have been living under the shadow of Luis Suarez since the Uruguayan left in the summer, but there are signs that the gloom has lifted.

Brendan Rodgers continued his festive revival on Monday evening with a resounding 4-1 victory over former club Swansea to move up to eighth in the Premier League table.

Not only was it Liverpool's most impressive league performance of the season, it was also the first time that the Reds have scored four goals in a game since they had their former talisman in the side.

The last time that Liverpool scored four in any competition was during a 4-0 league hammering of Tottenham on 30 March 2013, which provided the catalyst for a title run-in that came within touching distance of reclaiming the trophy last term.

On that Sunday, Suarez scored the second after an own-goal opener by Younes Kaboul - before Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson completed the rout.

That was 34 games or 39 weeks or 273 days to the day that the Merseyside club has taken to recover from the loss of Suarez to the extent that they have dominated a game in the same style they managed on a regular basis last season.

During the 2013-14 campaign, the free-scoring Reds scored more than four goals in 11 separate league games - with Suarez's name on the scoresheet more often than not, none more so than the four goals he scored during the 5-2 hammering of Norwich last December.

On Monday, the goals came from Alberto Moreno, a brace from Adam Lallana (with the assistance of Lukas Fabianski) and an own goal from former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey. 

Whether the floodgates will remain open, or whether Anfield supporters will once again be lamenting the loss of Suarez after their next fixture against Leicester City on New Year's Day remains to be seen.
