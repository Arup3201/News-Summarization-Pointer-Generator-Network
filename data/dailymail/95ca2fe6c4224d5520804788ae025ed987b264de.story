Falling and finding herself unable to get up, a North Carolina woman says it was her dog who came to her rescue dialling 911.

Laying on the floor of her Asheville home, Dorothy Davidson said she found herself trapped and unable to reach her phone when her dog Spirit rushed to her side.

'I fell in the bathroom, I was just weak but when I got down on the floor I couldn't get back up and I couldn't reach the phone,' she told WABC.

Life safer: Seen ready at her side, Dorothy Davidson's dog Spirit is what she calls her hero

To the rescue! Raised by Ms Davidson since she was a puppy, Spirit is specially trained to call for help if her owner is in trouble

Suffering lateral sclerosis, a disorder in the same family as Lou Gehrig's Disease that makes her require a walker to get around, she said Spirit was trained on exactly what to do.

'I sent her in to tap help,' she said of her Golden Retriever mix.

With the push or 'tap' of a button, Ms Davidson said: 'She activated the phone I have for her.'

Ms Davidson says she's had Spirit since she was a puppy, having been trained by Florida group Dogs for Life who offers assistance dogs as well as pet therapy.

Care givers: The non-profit group Dogs for Life trains dogs of all breeds to care for their disabled owners like this pug whose owner suffers PTSD

At the ready: The dogs are also trained to alert their owners when someone is at their door, a phone rings, or a smoke detector goes off, among other things like in Ms Davidson's case, picking things up

The non-profits dogs can help from anyone suffering physical disabilities to post traumatic stress disorder.

These heroes can also be made out of nearly any dog, with one rescued pug, previously featured by CNN, serving as one to a retired military police officer who suffers PTSD.

'If I’m out in like Walmart or somewhere I give her a go out command and she'll actually circle around me to keep the people three and four feet away from me,' owner James Taylor said of his tiny dog.

The dogs are also trained to alert their owners when someone is at their door, a phone rings, or a smoke detector goes off, among other things like in Ms Davidsons' much needed case of picking things up.

'In my estimation, yes, she is a hero,' Ms Davidson said of her own champ Spirit whom she says she’s raised from a puppy, dually serving as a faithful companion in her own life.
