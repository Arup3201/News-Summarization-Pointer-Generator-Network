The former two-weight world champion turned up at the shelter in Manchester with the donations to help those struggling during the festive season.

Hatton is a patron at charity Bernabus and the 36-year-old said he was glad to be in a position to help.

Hatton: 'It's heartbreaking, especially at Christmas, it's probably the hardest time of the year for them'

'I'm very proud as a Manchester lad of being a patron at Barnabus,' he told the Manchester Evening News. 'I regularly walk through the city centre and see poor people. 

'It's heartbreaking, especially at Christmas, it's probably the hardest time of the year for them. Some haven't got families, food or water. That's why I brought all this today.'

Fundraising manager Carol Price said: 'It's been an amazing day. Things like this are really important at this time of year. 

'When people are homeless and they see people in town partying and shopping, it reminds them of how little they have.' 

Dharmesh Bhayani from Europium also donated more than £1,000 for a buffet and pairs of shoes for those at the centre.
