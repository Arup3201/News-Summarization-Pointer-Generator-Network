Millions of London homes rose in value by more than the average salary of a nurse or a teacher in the city last year.

In 20 out of 33 boroughs, a typical house earned £38,000, compared to a London nurse on £35,300 and a secondary school teacher on £37,800.

In a third of boroughs in the capital, houses even earned more than a typical solicitor on £70,000.

And in two of London’s most exclusive areas – Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster – prices shot up by more than David Cameron’s salary of £142,000.

The average price rise across the capital was £57,000 in the 12 months to April – far higher than what many residents earn.

The National Housing Federation, which campaigns for affordable housing and analysed the latest Land Registry and Office for National Statistics data, said the figures showed a ‘chronic shortage of affordable homes’, which is driving up prices beyond the reach of earners.

David Orr, of the federation, said: ‘It’s no secret that house prices are way beyond the reach of pay packets of hard-working Londoners, but these figures show just how absurd and unfair the housing crisis has become.

‘The housing market is clearly broken when house prices are rising by amounts larger than the entire salary of a nurse, teacher or firefighter. What chance have our core workers got of ever owning a home in London?’

Mr Orr said only Londoners earning more than £100,000 could comfortably afford a home in the city. He called for the Government to come up with a long-term plan to end London’s housing crisis ‘within a generation’.

‘The fact that even well-paid professionals in the city can’t afford to buy a home and in many cases even struggle to pay their rent should send alarm bells ringing,’ Mr Orr added. ‘And this isn’t a matter of choice in where you live.

‘We need nurses, teachers, firefighters and plumbers in every city. Therefore we need to build homes that they can afford.’

Nick Taylor, 26, a staff nurse in south London, told the federation: ‘I love working and living in London but I’ve resigned myself to the fact that I will never be able to afford a home here that I could afford elsewhere in the country.’

A third of boroughs saw rises of £70,000, more than the average salary for a solicitor, while the average for the whole capital was £38,000 - compared to a nurse earning just £35,300

The average property in London rose in value by 18 per cent in the last 12 months and now costs £460,000. 

According to the Land Registry, this is two and a half times more than the national average of £177,000 – which increased by just 2.9 per cent in a year.

Struggling first-time buyers get an average of £18,505 from ‘the bank of mum and dad’, according to property experts Slater & Gordon.

But one in seven parents who help their children on to the property ladder are now in debt. More than three quarters of 500 parents polled dipped into their savings and some were forced to remortgage their own homes or downsize.

Many said they were now anxious about their own financial situation – but just 6 per cent regretted lending the money.
