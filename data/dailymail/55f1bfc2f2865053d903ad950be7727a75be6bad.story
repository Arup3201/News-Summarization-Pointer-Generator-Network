A quick jog here, a shoving match there. Throw in a laundry basket, a concealed headset and talk of telescopes and you understand why Jose Mourinho is touchline box office.

On Sunday, at Old Trafford, his latest stunt was to enter Manchester United’s dugout for a chat.

Here, Sportsmail offers Mourinho a little advice on touchline etiquette…

Do stay until the end of the game…

For a man of untold wealth, you previously justified your habit of leaving early by saying you wanted to phone your wife with the score. No internet connection at home? No Sky subscription? One of these days it will get you in trouble, Jose. Surely the angry eyes above Roy Keane’s beard told you that much a few weeks back. Wait an extra couple of minutes or send your wife a text.

Don’t climb into other managers' dugouts…

Everyone knows that the Manchester United managerial situation might once have be a bit of a sore point. ‘Should have been me’, and all that. But climbing into the dugout after the game on Sunday? Even if it was to see your old mate Louis, it’s a bit much.

Don't think outside the box…

Rightly or wrongly, those technical areas are here to stay and that means you stay as well. None of this charging down the line with waving arms when you score. Same goes for knee slides. It’s entertaining but it drives fans feral.

Don’t go on one of your jaunts and shamelessly pass on tactical information…

It’s one thing to leave your technical area to celebrate (which isn’t really that bad but it is against the rules), yet it is quite another when you do it to pass on tactical information, as you did against PSG in the Champions League in April. Everyone thought you were simply re-enacting your 2004 jog when Porto beat Manchester United. But you kindly confirmed you were passing on tactical instructions to Fernando Torres. We’re not convinced that explanation made it OK.

Do keep your head during intense rivalries…

Poking the late Tito Villanova in the eye during El Clasico was a low point.

Don’t repeatedly bait Arsene Wenger…

Wenger is combustible and he, too, can be provocative, as his recent shove against your chest demonstrated. But there is no need to taunt him so mercilessly. Calling him a ‘specialist in failure’ was rather unkind and the whole voyeur argument was a little unnecessary too.

Is the following really how you should speak of a fellow professional: ‘He is someone who likes to watch other people. There are some guys who have this big telescope to see what happens in other families. He must be one of them.’ 

Wenger’s response was: ‘When you give success to stupid people, it makes them more stupid sometimes and not more intelligent.’ 

The pair of you sometimes act like articulate five-year-olds.

Do stay on the right side of diligent and don’t go too far…

It’s true that there have been occasions where you have been punished for comments that others could make without censure. That is a double standard and unfair. But it’s also true that while you are right to speak out against officials for poor decisions – and some of those by Phil Dowd in the Manchester United game on Sunday were poor – you can also go too far. Accusing Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time during a Champions League match in 2005 was going too far. Frisk elected to retire because of death threats and you were called ‘an enemy of football’.

Don’t hide in laundry baskets...

You were given a two-game ban for that Frisk incident and, hats off, your alleged solution was ingenious. In the first instance, it is believed you were feeding information to the touchline via a headset worn by fitness coach Rui Faria, disguised by a hat. It is also claimed that you were smuggled out of a dressing room – from which you were banned – in a laundry trolley. All very clever but not allowed.

Do be respectful to fans/press…

That means not holding your finger to your lips in front of the Liverpool fans, as you did after your late equaliser in the 2005 League Cup final. You later said it was a gesture to the press, but that’s not OK, either.

Don’t wear a scarf and no coat…

Sunday’s look was odd. Like short sleeves and gloves.
