Liverpool and Barcelona were inching towards an agreement for Luis Suarez on Friday night.

Catalan TV stations reported that a fee of £63million was agreed with Suarez handed a five year deal that would make him their fourth highest paid player behind Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta.

Liverpool are continuing to negotiate though and want to establish whether there is a chance of signing Alexis Sanchez.

Southampton insisting he is not for sale after rejecting their second

fails to report to pre-season in two weeks' time but Southampton don't 
wish to sell. Southampton have also rejected Cardiff’s £3m bid £3m for defender Jose Fonte
