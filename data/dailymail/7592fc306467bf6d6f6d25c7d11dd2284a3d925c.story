Lionel Messi has revealed he is more focused on winning titles with Barcelona than competing with Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo for individual honours.

The La Liga duo, who have between them won the last six Ballon d'Or awards, are often compared to each other due to their fine goalscoring records in Spain and Europe.

However Messi has distanced himself from such comparisons by insisting he doesn't like competing with the Portuguese superstar.

'Competing with Cristiano? I don't feel like competing with him or anyone else,' said Messi. 'It's not about individual awards. I want to help my team.

'I don't think about my place in football history. I just want to keep getting better and win trophies with my team.'

Messi believes his Barcelona team-mate Neymar has the potential to leapfrog both Ronaldo and himself to become the best player in world football.

He added: 'It's only his second year here, but I have a great relation with Neymar, both on and off the pitch. He's a great kid.

'Because of his potential, I think Neymar could become the best in the world. He's a great player; it's a pleasure to play with him.'
