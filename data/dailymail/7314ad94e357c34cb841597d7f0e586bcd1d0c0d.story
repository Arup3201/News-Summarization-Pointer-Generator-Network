The significant rise in families choosing to home school their children has raised concerns from public and government bodies.

In Australia, home schooling is recognised as a legitimate way of providing for the educational needs of children, and increasingly parents are deciding to educate their children through the non-traditional method.

Children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required to undergo some form of education, and while less than 1% of children in Australia are home schooled, the New South Wales Board of Studies reported a 40% increase in the number of those home schooled from 2009 to 2013.

It has been estimated that up to 10,000 children in NSW are being home schooled for reasons including ideological or religious views, bullying in schools, or a belief that the traditional method of formal education is failing a new generation of Australians.

Mum-of-five Lindy Hadges has homeschooled all five of her children is an advocate for the method

'I was gobsmacked that people were willing to give their children up so early and move on. I couldn't understand and really saw giving children to others as a weakening thing,' Lindy said 

This is the case for mum-of-five Lindy Hadges, who chose to home school all of her children.

'From very early on after I had my first child, I heard people talking about what preschool they were going to send their child to,' Lindy said.

'I was gobsmacked that people were willing to give their children up so early and move on. I couldn't understand and really saw giving children to others as a weakening thing.'

'It's so important for parents to pass on values and that takes time. If their children are gone for 6 to 8 hours of the day that's the best time.'

'It seems unnatural to me that a young baby could walk and talk without needing lessons, and yet it was just accepted that they would need to be handed over to experts to learnt to read and write.' 

For the state governments, finding the right balance between allowing parents their given right to educate their children in the method they see fit and ensuring that these children all receive a comparable level of education that prepares them for work or further study has proven a difficult task.

'When I first started out 21 years ago, people were so critical. There was a lot of fear and anxiety and but now that I've been out of the box for so long I've developed more strength and balance,' Lindy said.

'In the beginning, you were a criminal if you did it. I would put it on the level of persecution, but it was just a fear-based response. Back then, it was so unknown that people immediately felt threatened.'

'Now, it's much more common. Pretty much everyone talk to knows someone who is homeschooled and it's much more encouraging,' she said.

However, the learning structure for the Hadley's is quite different to those in traditional education, and according to Lindy, allows for greater freedom of mind.

'We make sure all our learning happens in positive environments. We sit in a circle in the sunshine, or cuddled up together in bed.'

'What we learn is very directed by what the children are interested in. We get to have long discussions and jump into different aspects of a book, like the history of the setting, or grammar, or the author, or moral questions.'

'I don't like that in school these are all so divided. Learning should be a wholistic experience so that children stay inspired with the joy of learning.' 

Registration for home schooling is compulsory in many states, including NSW, Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland, but as education curriculum and requirements varies depending on the state, understanding the desires and needs of those involved is often barred by red tape and unreliable statistics. 

Many in the home schooling community have responded to this, with a group of Central Coast home educators forming a petition that protests against what they view as unnecessary paperwork and unreasonable standards which make it more difficult to home school children.  

The Home Education Association collected more than 10,000 signatures which called for more consultation on the issue of home schooling, which was lodged in parliament by Gosford state Liberal MP Chris Holstein (above)

Terry Harding, general manager of the Christian Education Ministry said that in an era of rapid change for education, home schooling was significantly increasing. 

'It is important for governments to recognise such changes and developments, and move to accommodate them on the Australian educational landscape,' Mr Harding said. 

The Home Education Association collected more than 10,000 signatures which called for more consultation on the issue, which was lodged in parliament by Gosford state Liberal MP Chris Holstein, reported The Daily Telegraph. 

Many parents choose to educate their children at home in order to allow what they see as a much more natural development, and to allow them to spend quality time together as a family that can be denied by traditional education.

'These are human beings. They need time to understand how they function and live in the world,' said Lindy.

'I see homeschooling as a wonderful opportunity to train my child carefully. Instead of throwing my child into the deep end of the pool, I can take my child's hand and walk into the shallow end, help him through to the deep end and then let go.'

'We spend so much time together, and I really think that children who are homeschooled are much more emotionally mature because everything is a negotiation.'

'They are much less jaded and have a lot more agency for life.' 

Lindy said that many parents choose to educate their children at home because of bullying in schools, and in order to remove the competitive element from learning.

'Why should children compete for their education? That is barbarous,' said Lindy.

'The whole system should be overhauled. Traditional education turns off the joy of learning, and teaches them to walk a treadmill.'

'It's a great danger to do that to any mind.'

In response to the growth of home education, and amid concerns regarding child welfare in homeschool environments, a Legislative inquiry was launched in May by the NSW Government, which received submissions until August. 

Hundreds of submissions were made by parents, lobby groups, teachers’ unions and government departments, many of whom expressed a frustration with the limitations traditional school education placed on their families and with the expectations outlined in the state governments home schooling package which was released in 2013.

'Employees from the home school unit can either be supportive of the method or against it, and you never really know who you're going to get,' Lindy said.

'All of the people on the board have gone through traditional school educations and are completely ignorant. There's a huge spectrum of opinions in the home schooling community, and we'd like to see that reflected on the board.'

'It's a very combative approach, as they're a very critical authority. We are much more open and fluid and operate outside of the system and we'd prefer to be addressed that way than always be in conflict, which is very inflammatory.'  

The Department of Family and Community Services noted in their submission that there were concerns that home schooling provided the potential for masking child abuse, 'as there are fewer opportunities for those outside the home to note possible concerns and to raise any necessary alarms'.

The submission also raised the issue of the lack of peer interaction, noting that 'the quality of interaction between peers in a classroom can enhance the learning experience.'

Lindy stressed the point that the lack of socialisation for homeschooled children is a myth.

'The homeschool network is so large and varied, in terms of background and ages, that homeschooled children probably have a wider social network than children who attend school and are in a class with peers who are only their age,' she said.

'There are excursions on all the time, so if you wanted to meet with others you could do so morning and afternoon, five days a week.' 

'The younger are lead by the older, and the family unit is kept together, which creates a much stronger bond. It's very positive thing for the community to have families like that.' 

'Some might consider it a drawback that they will take longer to fit into the system of work, and that can make waves, but I'd rather have that than have someone who’s mind is turned off.'

'My children have all been raised freethinkers, and I'd much rather have that than a numbing of the brain.'

'They have a stronger sense of who they are and haven’t become detatched by the mindlessness of the traditional school system. If they have to learn to navigate a system I'd rather have them do that at 18 or 21 rather than when they're five.'
