Britain's Paralympic poster girls are already being lined up for lucrative sponsorship contracts ahead of the London 2012 Games.

Female athletes could earn up to £100,000 in sponsorship and media deals, echoing the success of Olympians such as Jessica Ennis and Victoria Pendleton.

During previous Games, less than a dozen of the most successful Paralympians are thought to have landed deals with major sponsors.

But experts said the London 2012 Paralympics, which begins on Wednesday, is about to change all that.

Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, said he expected up to a dozen British Paralympians to reach £100,000 in revenue, if they achieved gold medal success in the next two weeks.

While it is still a long way off the £5million that heptathlete Ennis is anticipated to earn over the next few months, it does reflect the surging level of interest in the Paralympics.

Mr Currie said: ‘Paralympians will benefit hugely from the success of the Olympics.

‘For many, it will be the first time they have experienced such high media coverage or been offered big sponsorship deals.

‘In previous Paralympics Games, only a
handful have attracted high levels of sponsorship, but now quite a few 
have the chance to make a lot of money.’

Track cyclist and seven-times Paralympic gold medallist Sarah Storey, 34, is said to be top of the list.

Another athlete expected to do well is ‘blade runner’ Stefanie Reid, 27, who lost part of a leg in a speedboat accident.

Mr
Currie said: ‘Sponsors will always look for the glamorous competitors, 
but they will also look for those who have faced the hardest challenges 
to get to the Paralympics or for the biggest personalities.

'As with the 
Olympics, it is not just about medals, it is about the story behind the 
athletes and stand-out characters.

‘But
unlike the Olympics, where the big names were already known, the 
sponsors may sit back and wait to see who does well or who captures the 
public’s imagination before they offer the big sponsorship deals.’

Here, the Daily Mail profiles the athletes who are likely to become the British golden girls of the 2012 Paralympics:

Rowers Pamela Relph and Naomi Riches – nicknamed the 'two blondes in a boat' – will compete in the mixed coxed fours and are strong medal contenders.

Relph, 22, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, started rowing after her career in the Army was cut short by worsening arthritis which had affected her from the age of seven.

Her 24-year-old sister Monica, a British rower, encouraged her to try out for the Paralympics rowing squad.

She said: 'It was really strange for me when they said I classified for the Paralympics. I didn't really feel like I was disabled, because I had probably made the assumption that you need to be in a wheelchair or have had a limb amputated.

'Within a week of being discharged from the military I was qualified as a Paralympic athlete.'

Relph, who is in the minimal disability boat, said she 'cannot wait' for the Games to begin. But she added: 'As a rower, you don't drink, you go to bed early and you have to eat really cleanly.

'I have been teetotal for five months and have about three bottles of champagne in my fridge waiting to be cracked open after the Games, whatever the outcome.'

Riches, 29, a partially sighted jewellery designer, said: 'In 2004 GB needed girls in the Paralympics crew and I ticked all the boxes – I was quite tall, I had tried rowing at college and I was visually impaired.

'Four months later I went to my first world championship. I absolutely took to it and got hooked on the sport.'

Wheelchair basketball player Amy Conroy, 19, had her leg amputated after she was diagnosed with cancer at 13.

Conroy,
whose mother Ann died from cancer aged 40, was given a 50/50 chance of 
survival and, after her leg was amputated, had gruelling chemotherapy.

Her teacher father Chris stayed
with her every day for a year at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. 
Conroy said: ‘My dad was amazing.’

She
learned to walk again with a prosthetic leg and took up wheelchair 
basketball at 16. she said: ‘At first, I thought it would be quite lame.
But then I saw it and loved it. It was fast and vicious!’

'I'm going to keep pushing myself': Sarah Storey, who has won Paralympic gold in both swimming and cycling

Track and road cyclist Sarah Storey, 34, who was born with no left hand, has won seven gold medals across both swimming and cycling.

She first competed in the Paralympics in swimming aged only 14, winning two golds, three silvers and a bronze medal on her debut.

Over the next 12 years she won hordes of medals at every single Games.

She was always curious about cycling and, after developing an ear infection in 2005, used the break from swimming to try out the velodrome.

Her husband, track cyclist Barney Storey, encouraged her when he noticed she had a natural talent for the sport. She loved it and dropped swimming, going on to win two more golds at the 2008 Beijing Games.

She said: 'I officially switched to cycling at the end of 2005 and as Barney is such an expert, it helped me become better quickly because he could tell me straight away if I was doing something wrong. His advice and support were crucial.'

At this Paralympics she will compete in four events – two on the road and two on the track – and is expected to win medals in all of them.

She and her 34-year-old husband, an able-bodied cyclist who will be a pilot rider for partially sighted Neil Fachie in the Paralympics, admit they are 'sporting anoraks'. They spend their days off watching Manchester United or going for long walks at their home in Disley, near Manchester.

Storey narrowly missed out on competing in the women's team pursuit during the Olympics, in which Dani King, Jo Rowsell and Laura Trott won gold, but has not given up hope of making it into the Olympic squad for the Rio 2016 games.

She said: 'I'm just going to keep pushing myself as an athlete. If I'm good enough and I get selected, that will be fantastic.'

The cyclist already has four major sponsors and 13 corporate 'partners'.

Sprinter and long jumper Stefanie 
Reid was preparing for a career in professional rugby when she had a 
devastating speedboat accident aged 16.

On
holiday with her best friend and their family in Canada in 2000, she 
was hanging on to a rubber ring while being pulled along by the boat, an
activity known as tubing, when she lost her grip and fell into the 
water.

The driver of 
the boat turned it round to go to collect her, but did not see her in 
the water. She tried to duck down below the water but was wearing a 
lifejacket and the boat went over her, cutting her leg to the bone.

Reid, 27, the daughter of a Scottish 
father and English mother, said: ‘I resurfaced and everyone on the boat 
was freaking out and I couldn’t tell why. At that point I realised all 
the water around me was  red and for a second I thought I’d been cut in 
half. Then I blacked out.’

Surgeons at a hospital in Toronto amputated her leg below the knee, saving her life.

She
admits she was initially ‘angry’ about her disability, until a 
straight-talking nurse told her she had to get on with her life.

While
studying biochemistry at Queen’s University in Canada, she saw an 
athletics training session and wondered how fast she could run. The 
answer was very fast.

At the Paralympics Reid, who will wear a high-tech blade to run, could win medals in the 100m, 200m and long jump.
