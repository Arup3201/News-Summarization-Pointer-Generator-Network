While the rest of the royal family braved the cold as they headed to church yesterday morning, Zara Phillips was enjoying Christmas weather of a very different kind. 

The 33-year-old royal was all smiles as she joined sailing fans in sunny Sydney to wave off boats taking part in the Sydney to Hobart 2014 - one of the toughest yacht races in the world.

Resplendent in a pair of navy shorts and a matching polo shirt, Zara looked tanned and happy as she strolled around the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia with its president, Commodore John Cameron.

But although she clutched a cuddly toy seal, Zara's baby daughter Mia were nowhere to be seen. Husband Mike Tindall, 36, was there however and joined his wife on  main sponsor Rolex's viewing yacht.

The mother-of-one is in Sydney ahead of the Jeep Magic Millions race meeting which kicks off on the Gold Coast on the 10th January. Patron of Racing Women, an initiative that aims to boost ownership of racehorses among women, Zara first became involved with the race in 2013.

As in 2013, she will present the winner of the Racing Women bonus prize with a cheque for $500,000 (£260,000) and a trophy but has missed having a traditional family Christmas to be there.

Like the rest of the royal family, Zara usually spends the festive season at Sandringham with the Queen  but instead chose to fly to Australia early for what is the country's fourth royal visit in less than a year.

Royal visit: Zara's trip to Australia is the fourth by a member of the royal family in less than a year

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George were the first to visit Australia and New Zealand when they travelled to the two countries in April this year.

Next came the Princess Royal in October, who spent most of her trip in Brisbane at an agricultural conference before taking part in charity events on behalf of Riding for the Disabled and Save the Children.

She was followed to Australia a month later by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, who was there to mark the 50th year of Australian participation in the Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme.

The initiative, which was set up by Prince Philip, encourages school children to take part in camping expeditions, as well as doing community and charity work.

Although Zara has no royal title, she proved a hit with the crowds at the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia.

Joined by Australian celebrities, among them Olympic swimmer Geoff Huegill,  she helped wave off 117 yachts - all of whom are battling it out to take first prize in what has been described as the world's 'most testing race'.

Stretching 628 nautical miles (722 miles) from Sydney to Hobart in Tasmania, the route takes in the Bass Strait, which is regarded as one of the most perilous waterways in the world.

Twice as wide and twice as rough as the English Channel, the Strait is famous for shipwrecks and was the scene of six deaths during the 1998 race following a storm.

Although Zara is not taking part in the race, she is a keen sailing fan and joined sailors for the Artemis Challenge, a 50-mile charity race around the Isle of Wight, last August.

Part of the annual Cowes Week, the race takes competitors on a circuit of the island with winners taking a £10,000 prize to donate to the charity of their choice.

Although Zara's yacht failed to win, she did enjoy the day and described the experience as 'absolutely beautiful'. 'We had a great time out there,' she said after the race. 'It was an absolutely beautiful day to be out on the water and I really enjoyed the action at the start. 

'It was a good race, it would have been great to have a bit more wind but I’m really pleased we got to go round the Island. The Artemis Challenge is an event I enjoy every time I do it.'

Dangerous: The 114 yachts taking part will have to navigate the perilous Bass Strait during their 628 nautical mile journey

Bumpy ride: According to local weather reports, the 117 yacht flotilla will have a bumpy first night at sea

Stopped short: Six of the yachts in the flotilla have already been forced to retire thanks to the rough seas off New South Wales

Beautiful: The departing yachts were backdropped by the spectacular Sydney skyline

Long journey: The yachts taking part in the 70-year-old race will finish their journey in the Tasmanian town of Hobart
