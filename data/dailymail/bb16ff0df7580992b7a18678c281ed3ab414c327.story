A Mexican supermarket owned by the Wal-Mart chain could be forced to close after hosting a cock fight in the store in a bid to promote a drinks company.

The incident came to light after outraged animal rights activists posted pictures from the event earlier this month in the city of Boca del Rio, on social media and demanded action against the retailer.

Shoppers in the store at the time of the fight say people had been drinking beer they had purchased in the supermarket and had been gambling on the outcome of the fights.

Now it has emerged that the store, in the south-eastern Mexican state of Veracruz, could be fined for breaching alcohol and gambling rules, as well as animal cruelty and possibly even shut down.

Police were called to the store after several shoppers inside complained about what they saw.

Demian Reynoso, who was one of those to call the police said: 'There were children in the supermarket and I'm sure they were not impressed at seeing two cocks tearing each other apart in the middle of the aisles between the food.

'There is a reason why gambling on cockfights is illegal here in Boca del Rio. It is a nasty and violent and a totally cruel activity.'

However, a spokesman for Walmex, the Mexican firm owned by parent company Wal-Mart said that the event was not technically a cockfight because the birds were not hurt or 'armed with blades' and no official bets were made.

But now the company has to prove no official bets were made after animal-rights activists say people were standing around gambling on the results.

People posted pictures of the event on social media with some demanding action be taken against the retailer for hosting the event 

The company has until next Wednesday to prove that it was not a cockfight before the city considers fines as punishment.

The local council's consumer affairs department boss, Jose Luis Hernandez Gonzalez, said: "We are investigating over gambling, breaches over the rules on the consumption of alcoholic drinks and other offences regarding the protection of animals.

'We are currently waiting to see the company's response to the allegations.

'We were not impressed when we sent inspectors to check it out after getting complaints and the managers would not let us inside as it was private property.'

The retailer could face fines of as much as 96,000 Pesos (US$7,000) if Wal-Mart Mexico, or Walmex, is found guilty of staging the event according to Mr Gonzalez, who added that it might also be possible to force it to close.
