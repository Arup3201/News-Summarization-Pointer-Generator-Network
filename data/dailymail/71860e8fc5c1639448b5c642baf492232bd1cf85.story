John Carver says he cannot defend Papiss Cisse after admitting the Newcastle striker spitting in the face of Jonny Evans was worse than breaking the leg of an opponent.

Newcastle will be without their 11-goal top scorer for the first time at Everton on Sunday since he was hit with a seven-game ban following the altercation with Evans.

The Manchester United defender was suspended for six matches for his part in the incident, in which he first spat at Cisse to provoke the reaction from the Magpies striker.

There has been a lot of debate in the 10 days since the disgusting clash as to whether or not spitting merited a ban double the length of one for a tackle which could cause serious injury.

Carver, though, was clear on his thoughts when that question was put to him.

‘When you have played the game it (spitting) is worse, yes,’ he said. ‘It's one of the lowest forms of anything you can do on the pitch. A lot of players would have acted differently. He retaliated in the same manner, which is just as bad.

‘I sat with him and I said, “Listen, I can't defend you on this. You've done wrong and have to accept whatever punishment you get”. There's no place in the game for it. He got what he deserved.’

Cisse’s future on Tyneside is now uncertain. Despite boasting the best goals-per-minute ratio in the Premier League this season, Newcastle remain concerned about a lingering knee issue for which he underwent more treatment this week.

When asked if the 29-year-old would be at the club next year, Carver said: ‘It's a difficult question to answer because I'm only thinking about the now, and I haven't got him for seven games.

‘But he scores goals and I don't think his knee is a big issue. We have always used this word “maintenance” about his knee and it is just making sure that everything is right. But he’s a big loss.’ 

Meanwhile, Carver admits he has sympathy with under-fire Everton boss Roberto Martinez. Newcastle finished fifth in 2012 but were nearly relegated the following season and cited the rigours of a Europa League campaign as reason for their struggle.

‘Ask any of these managers who qualified for Europe how it affects your league form - you all start fighting for your lives down the bottom of that league table - it's not easy,’ he said.

‘They've got to do something about it. I would go back to a straight knockout format.

‘When you work so hard to get your team into a position to qualify for it and then you've got to play so many games it's detrimental to your bread and butter, which is Premier League football.

‘Spurs have a massive squad and were almost playing two different sides. That's how they coped with it – but Everton can't and we couldn’t either.’
