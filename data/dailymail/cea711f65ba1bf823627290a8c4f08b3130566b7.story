Chasing mice is a distant memory, and her fur isn’t as fluffy as it used to be.

But at the grand age of 24, Poppy has reason to celebrate – after being crowned the oldest cat in the world.

Guinness World Records announced that the tortoiseshell pet has clocked up 114 ‘cat years’ since her birth in February 1990.

Birthday: Poppy from Bournemouth, Dorset, has now been recognised as the world's oldest living cat

Family: Poppy the cat with owner Jacqui West and her two sons Joe (left), 12, and Toby (right), eight

Poppy is now frail and spends most of 
her time indoors, but she has been recognised by Guinness World Records -
 and is two years younger than Misao Okawa of Japan, the world’s oldest 
person.

The cat - who 
was originally called Popsy and had two owners in her early days - has 
picked up the title following the death of Pinky, a cat from Hoyt in 
Kansas, US, who passed away aged 23 last year.

At
 the age of five Poppy was adopted by Marguerite Corner and her daughter
 Jacqui. When she was ten she went with Jacqui, who had moved in with 
future husband Andy West.

The
 couple now have two sons - Joe,11 and Toby, eight - and Poppy shares 
their home with four other cats, two rabbits and a hamster.

Frail: Poppy, who is now aged 24, was born in February 1990 and has lived through five British prime ministers

She is deaf and blind, but despite her age and frailty she is still said to be the boss of the house.

'She
 is partial to the odd takeaway. We sometimes give her a bit of KFC 
chicken, fish and chips and even the odd bit of kebab meat'

Jacqui West, owner

Mrs West, 43, said: ‘People 
always ask what we put Poppy’s longevity down to and I guess she has a 
good diet and lots of exercise.  She keeps herself fit by walking around
 and she eats a lot.

‘She 
has biscuits in the morning and tinned food later on. She’s never been a
 big cat though.  She is partial to the odd takeaway. We sometimes give 
her a bit of KFC chicken, fish and chips and even the odd bit of kebab 
meat.’

Mrs West, an 
accountant, wrote to Guinness World Records in February after Poppy 
turned 24, submitting her into the category of ‘Oldest Cat Currently 
Living’.

They investigated their claim and have now confirmed Poppy as the world’s oldest living cat.

Craig
 Glenday, Guinness World Records editor-in-chief, said: ‘We’ve been 
overwhelmed with claims for the “oldest living cat”, with owners from 
across the globe making applications on behalf of their cats.

‘Today, though, I’m pleased to confirm that we’re recognising Poppy from Bournemouth in the UK as the world’s oldest living cat, at the age of 24 years.

‘If anyone thinks their cat beats this, and can prove it, then we’d encourage them to get in touch with us.’

Difference: At 24 in cat years, Poppy has lived twice as long as Joe (right) and three times as long as Toby (left)

The oldest cat in history was a feline called Creme Puff who lived in Austin, Texas, and survived for an astonishing 38 years and three days.

Mrs West added: ‘Poppy is definitely the top cat and she is still quite feisty. If one of the other cats tries to eat her food she will bite them on the ear.

‘She’s deaf and blind and meows for everything. We call her stroppy Poppy sometimes.  She can get up the stairs but we won’t let her walk down. Over the last year her health has gone down and we know the end is near.

‘We knew she is old but to be officially recognised is just great. We are all chuffed for her. I think all old cats deserve recognition of their achievement. As a family, we are so pleased that she is still with us as well.

Record holder: Poppy's age of 24 in cat years is equivalent to 114 in human years - two years younger than Misao Okawa of Japan, the world's oldest person

‘There have been times in this last year when her health has declined and I’ve thought it was the end on several occasions but then she recovers and carries on.

'Poppy does seem to be out-living all our other pets too. We unfortunately had a hamster and bunny die on us last year. Each time we tell the grandparents we’ve lost an animal, they all assume its Poppy.

'I’ve said goodbye to her a few times but she keeps on going. It brought a big smile to my face when I was told that Poppy was officially the world’s oldest cat.'

She also paid tribute to the 'wonderful vets and staff' at Companion Care Vets in Bournemouth.
