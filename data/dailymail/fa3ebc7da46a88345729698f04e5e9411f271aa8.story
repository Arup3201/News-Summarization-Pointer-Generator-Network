Former Chelsea defender Khalid Boulahrouz hasn't always been the luckiest when it comes to love.

Boulahrouz's marriage to wife Sabia ended last year and she is now in a relationship with former Tottenham man and Dutch compatriot Rafael van der Vaart.

But the 32-year-old appears to have bounced back after it was revealed on Wednesday that he is dating Miss Netherlands 2014 Yasmin Verheijen - who is 12 years his junior.

Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reports that the pair have been together for some time and that Boulahrouz - now playing for Feyenoord - plans to accompany his girlfriend to Miami for the Miss Universe pageant later this year.

Verheijen has German, Indian, Chinese and Hindu roots, was born and raised in Amsterdam and is in the final year of training as a decorator.
