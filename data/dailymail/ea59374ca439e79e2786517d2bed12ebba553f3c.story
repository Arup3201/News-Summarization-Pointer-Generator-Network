Super agent Mino Raiola has expressed his fervent desire to join the growing list of people prepared to challenge Sepp Blatter for his FIFA presidency.

Raiola - who represents players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Mario Balotelli and Paul Pogba to name a few - is a staunch opposer of the current regime in place at football's governing body, and believes it is time for change.

'I have been criticising FIFA for years, so it's time to act on it. I've had enough of how Blatter and Fifa have been treating the game. It makes me sick just thinking about it that Blatter is re-elected,' Raiola told Dutch magazine VI.

'FIFA should be there for the fans, professional players and amateur players, but they don't do anything for these three groups.

'How dare you organise a World Cup in South Africa and then ask €150 for a ticket? It's a disgrace.

'It's incomprehensible that some FAs still vote for Blatter. If people vote Blatter, they vote North Korea, if they vote me, they vote South Korea.'

The 47-year-old is not alone in his views, and will go up against the likes of Jerome Champagne, Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein and David Ginola in the quest to overthrow current president Blatter.

'If I don't manage to be a candidate this time around, I will give it another try in four years' time. I will find five FAs to back me. Which ones? I cannot say that just yet. A lot of things could change until the election.'
