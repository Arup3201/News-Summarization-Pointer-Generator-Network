George Zimmerman is speaking out about the Trayvon Martin killing for the first time in an interview with conservative talk show host Sean Hannity.

Friends and family members have told the neighborhood watch volunteer's side of the story since the controversial killing in February, but Zimmerman himself has remained silent.

The interview comes one day after it was revealed that Zimmerman and his wife blew through $36,000 of cash he raised from his online legal defense fund on personal expenses like car payments, cell phones and paying off credit card debt -- even though he was in jail at the time.

Opening up: Donations poured in on George Zimmerman's fundraising website after he spoke exclusively to Fox News's Sean Hannity

He went into hiding because he received 
thousands of death threats after he was initially not arrested because 
he claimed he opened fire on the unarmed teen in self defense.

'Zimmerman will open up about what happened the night of Trayvon Martinâ€™s death and his experience in the aftermath of the fatal shooting,' Fox News says.

The hour-long interview will air tonight at 9pm on Fox News.

Zimmerman appeared alongside his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, and talked about what led up to and what followed the shooting.

The interview is the culmination of several months of work by Hannity to land the exclusive interview.

Uproar: With all that has been said about the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, the public had never heard Zimmerman's story from the man himself

In 18 days in jail, George Zimmerman and his wife spent $36,000 on personal expenses, according to court filings by his lawyer, Mark O'Mara. Those expenses include:

Credit card bills: $7,000

Money for bail: $5,000

Car payments and rental: $4,300

Repaying loan from parents: $3,000

Land line telephone: $2,500

Rent: $1,900

Food: $1,300

AT&T wireless Internet: $1,300

Gas: $800

Jail commissary: $800

Jail calling cards: $600

Utilities: $400

New phones: $300 each

In April, at the height over the public uproar over the shooting, Zimmerman called Hannity and had an off-the-record conversation with him. The details of the call have never been made public.

The interview is also expected to discuss the $200,000 in donations he received from supporters via a PayPal he set up on his site therealgeorgezimmerman.com.

Court filings from O'Mara show that in 18 days, Zimmerman and his wife spent $36,000 to pay off credit card bills, buy phones, make car payments and pay for an Internet connection -- all of it while he was still in jail.

Among the expenses were $600 in jailhouse phone calls. Zimmerman, 28, spent three to five hours a day on the phone while he was in jail -- placing an average of 13 calls to friends and family each day, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

In many of those calls Zimmerman used code to talk about money, especially from the PayPal account,

The biggest single chunk of money was a $5,000 payment for Zimmerman's first bail, which was set at $150,000.

However, the couple spent $7,000 to pay down credit card bills -- $4,000 on their America Express bill alone. O'Mara says the bills were for expenses the Zimmerman incurred when they had to flee their home after they began receiving death threats.

They used $4,400 to make payments on two cars and $1,500 to rent a third car. Gas was $800.

Both Zimmerman and his wife Shellie bought new phones for $300 each and paid up front for a two-year contract.

A telephone land line and AT&T Internet were installed at the Zimmermans' safe house for $2,500 and $1,300, respectively.

All of these expenses, O'Mara argues, were 'judicious' use of the the cash sent by supporters.

After the living expenses were covered, the Zimmermans kept $20,000 for additional cash and turned the rest -- $123,000 over to O'Mara to be put in a legal defense fund.
