He may be known for his dashing looks and command a worldwide fanbase but Harry Styles' home town is the least musically sophisticated place in Britain, a study has found.

The odds could have been stacked against Mr Styles after research, which maps musical ability by area, revealed that Redditch tops the list for its lack of musical ear.

The 20-year-old's birthplace was ranked number one for its failure to engage with music and lack of musical sophistication.

The survey found that those living in certain areas of the country were more musically talented. Harry Styles' birth place, Redditch in Worcestershire came out as the least musical place in the UK

Mapped: The UK hotspots for having and not having musical talent according to researchers

But 185 miles away, talent is rife. Hastings was tipped to be the place with the highest level of musical ability. 

The East Sussex town is also the home of Andy Bell, from 90s pop band Erasure, who shot to fame for songs such as Chains of Love and Sometimes.

In second and third place came West Somerset and North Dorset. North Dorset is also the home of  Madonna.

Several spots behind, Bob Geldof's home town of Swale in Kent came out as number 10 in the musically talented list.

And as well as mapping out where the musically talented live, the study found that wealth influences musical ability.

The research into music psychology was published in science journal PLOS ONE. 

It's no Boomtown: The hometown of Bob Geldof, Swale in Kent, is not known for it's musical talent. The 62-year-old lives in the town featured in the top 10 worst places for musical ability in the UK. The research was completed by Goldsmiths University and BBC Lab UK

Erasure frontman Andy Bell's hometown Hastings, in East Sussex, was ranking the number one town in the UK for musical ability

Material Girl: Residents in North Dorset, Madonna's stomping ground are the most musical according to the research carried out by Goldsmiths University and BBC Lab UK

The results came after Goldsmiths, University of London and BBC Lab UK surveyed more than 94,000 people across the UK.

Those surveyed answered questions on musical background and musical habits as well as listening tests.

Researchers found that those with musical training
 had a clear advantage on the listening tests where they were asked to 
do things like remember distinctive tunes.

Duffy may sing about Warwick Avenue in London but she is actually originally from Gwynedd in north west Wales. The area was ranked number 10 in the top 10 for musically talented areas in the UK

After analysing the answers, results concluded that musical skills and ability are not evenly distributed across the population and that ability can be linked to a person's profession, education level and income.

Learning to play an instrument is 
strongly linked to household income with those with the highest level of musical 
training living in London, 
Cambridge, York, Cherwell, and Oxford.

An ability to hold a tune is also more common during 'flexible' periods of life- such as school, university or when a person is self-employed.

But Wales and the West Country - not 
economically wealthy areas - bucked the trend proving that high income 
and musical aptitude are not always linked.

 star Suzanne Shaw may not be pleased to hear that her hometown, 
Christchurch in Dorset, features on the 'least musically sophisticated' 
list, alongside Anglesey in Wales and Boston in Lincolnshire.

London boy Pete Doherty lives in one of the most musically talented areas in the UK, according to research by Goldsmiths University. The 34-year-old's place of residence, Hackney, came out at number nine in the musical talent ranking

Kinks singers Pete Quaife, Ray Davies, Mick Avory and Dave Davies hail from Haringey. The north London borough was voted the fifth most musically talented location in the UK

Redditch, in Worcestershire, hometown of Harry Styles, was ranked the least musical place in the UK, according to the research

Parts of Britain with the highest levels of musical sophistication include the London boroughs of Hackney, home to ex-Libertines frontman Pete Doherty, and Haringey, where The Kinks started out.

Blaenau Gwent in South Wales and Gwynedd, the hometown of singer Duffy located in the the north-west of the country, ranked fourth and tenth for their talent.

Dr Daniel Mullensiefen, lead researcher on the project from the Department of Psychology at Goldsmiths, said: 'It was fascinating to be involved in this study - the largest of its kind ever to be undertaken - and it was exciting to map out for the first time how musical expertise is spread across an entire nation.

'The most intriguing result for me is to be able to see on a map how musical skills are related to social conditions of our modern lives.

'Perhaps the most surprising result was the relationship between income and musicality.

'With a couple of exceptions, people who lived in postcode areas with a higher average income performed better in the music ability tests. The next question we're going to tackle is the cause behind this relationship.'

Dr Daniel Mullensiefen, one of the Goldsmiths University lecturers who carried out the study said results showed that men have a better sense of beat.

The professor, from the Department of Psychology at the university said that a worldwide survey of 147,000 participants showed that men had a better sense of beat than women.

'Women achieved significantly lower beat perception scores than men,' Dr Mullensiefen said.

Although men have a four per cent better beat perception, he said that they could be worse at dancing than women because: 'they have the skill but are unable to turn it in to movement'.

The results came from a survey which mapped the places in the UK with the highest level of musical ability. The research was a joint project between Goldsmiths, University of London and BBC Lab UK.
