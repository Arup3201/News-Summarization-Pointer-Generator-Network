Manchester United have signed Daley Blind for £14million as Louis van Gaal makes moves to sort out the defensive unrest at Old Trafford.

The Holland international immediately endeared himself to supporters by saying: 'It's an honour to sign for United. I can't wait to work at the biggest club in the world.' 

It means Van Gaal has now parted with more than £150million this summer - almost as much as the club have spent in total over the previous five years, with Radamel Falcao still  to come.

Blind, the son of former Ajax captain Danny, was a key player in Holland's run to the World Cup semi-finals under Van Gaal and understands the back-three system with which the team are currenty struggling - despite the clean sheet at Burnley this weekend. 

The 24-year-old wasn't included in Ajax's squad for the 2-0 defeat at Groningen on Sunday, with the Red Devils confirming the move on Monday.

Van Gaal said: 'He's very intelligent and versatile and a great addition to the team.' 

United have been  trying to shift players out on deadline day. Shinji Kagawa already said his goodbyes on Sunday after completing a £6.3million move back to Borussia Dortmund; United paid double that for the playmaker two years ago, while Javier Hernandez has joined Real Madrid on loan. 

Danny Welbeck looks set to leave the club and Tom Cleverley has offers on the table from Everton and Aston Villa.
