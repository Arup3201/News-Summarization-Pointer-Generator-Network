Lloyds Banking Group and Nationwide are asking mortgage applicants to prove the size of their pensions

The over-40s are now being told they are too old to take out a mortgage.

Some of Britain’s biggest banks and building societies are asking older homebuyers to prove they can afford repayments once they hit retirement age.

Anyone who cannot show they have a big enough pension will have their applications turned down.

The crackdown follows new rules introduced in April which forced mortgage companies to make tougher checks on applicants, to ensure they can afford to repay loans.

Borrowers must already sit through 90-minute interrogations, and provide months of bank statements and payslips.

Now some banks have gone one step further, with lenders such as Lloyds Banking Group and Nationwide demanding evidence of what applicants’ income will be after they reach the State retirement age – currently 65 for men, and 62 for women.

They won’t be allowed to depend on the state pension, which will rise to £155 a week from 2016. They also won’t be allowed to include investments and other savings.

Instead, those who will be making repayments after the State pension age must prove they are paying in to a private or company pension.

Anyone without personal provisions will be turned down, or asked to pay off their loan before they retire.

Banks could also refuse to accept applicants who intend to carry on working into their late sixties, or past 70.

The new rules mean many over-40s will 
have to take out loans over shorter periods, if at all. They will 
typically have to borrow less overall, so they can afford the higher 
repayments on shorter-term loans.

David
 Hollingworth, a director at broker London and Country Mortgages, said: 
‘There is no doubt it is harder for people trying to take out a mortgage
 now.

'The maximum age lenders will go to has reduced substantially.’

Under new rules introduced in April, borrowers must already sit through 90-minute interrogations, and provide months of bank statements and payslips

He added: ‘If someone has a very 
physical job such as a builder and says they intend to work past 
retirement age, the bank may not agree to take that into consideration.’

Couples
 with different ages will have to prove they can afford loans once the 
older partner hits the State pension age. Younger borrowers taking 
longer mortgages in order to afford a home will also be affected.

Before the financial crisis, buyers could receive up to seven times their income, and borrow 25 per cent more than their property was worth with no deposit.

Many took loans which were interest-only, meaning they never paid back the capital they borrowed.

Other types of mortgages allowed buyers simply to state their income without ever having to prove it, known as self-certification deals.

However, these became known as ‘liar loans’ because so many people exaggerated their income.

These practices led to thousands taking out mortgages they could not afford. After the crash, a new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, introduced restrictions to clamp down on the reckless lending that came before.

It has all but banned interest- only loans, and forced banks to put potential borrowers through stricter tests.

New rules introduced in April have had an immediate effect. The number of existing homeowners taking new deals has dropped by a quarter in the last two months, as borrowers have been put off by the daunting application process.
