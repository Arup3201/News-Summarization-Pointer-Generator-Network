When David Burder saw a two-man V8 chainsaw on display in New Zealand a few years ago his first thought was: 'I can make a better one'.

So the self-confessed rev-head from Whitlands in rural northeast Victoria built his own one-man chainsaw, powered by a V8 engine salvaged from a 1979 Holden Commodore.

Mr Burder, 56, is putting his 330kg monster chainsaw on show at the Fieldays agricultural technology expo in Hamilton, New Zealand this week.

His creation is so powerful it can cut through a 600mm diameter hardwood log in 2.5 seconds.

Mr Burder, who owns a wood splitter business in Whitlands, spent a year building the chainsaw in his spare time just for fun.

'I'm a bit of a V8 nut, a rev-head you might say,' he told MailOnline.

'It's just a great toy. My motto is "He who has best toy wins". Blokes will understand.'

Engine: 1979 Holden 253ci (4.2L) V8Carburetor: Four-barrel QuadrajetIgnition: ElectronicExhausts:Â  Four into one three-inch collectorsGearbox: 1.1 ratio right angle driveHarvester bar: 43 inchHarvester chain: 3/4 pitchWeight: 330kgSize: 2.6m length x .9m width x 1.5m heightFuel: 91 octane petrol

Most of the components were designed and made by Mr Burder or sourced through suppliers he uses for his business.

The most difficult part was finding a suitable gearbox, which he eventually imported specially from Germany.

Mr Burder said he had never seen anyone else make a one-man V8 chainsaw, and that his was safer than the two-man machines that are popular in the US.

'It's on a couple of little wheels so you can wheel it round and one person can use it quite safely,' he said.

'If you see the one Americans use, two people have got to pick them up and drop them on the log. If you tripped over all hell could break loose.'

The Fieldays expo has over 900 exhibitions but Mr Burder said his show always draws a big audience.

'We get an enormous crowd hanging around and it makes a lot of sawdust,' he said.

'They're just mind-boggled. They sit there with their minds open and a big grin on their face.'

A YouTube video of his chainsaw on display has received almost 1.5 million views since it was posted in October last year.
