The 74-year-old mother of legendary baseball star Cal Ripken Jr was kidnapped by an armed man on Tuesday.

Violet Ripken was forced from her Aberdeen, Maryland home at around 7am by the handgun-wielding thug who dragged her into her 1998 Lincoln Town Car and sped off.

A manhunt for the pensioner and her attacker was launched by Aberdeen Police Department who described the case as a missing persons investigation.

As they searched police in Baltimore County, Maryland got a call from an anonymous tipster about a suspicious vehicle.

According to wbaltv.com the call came from a passer by who spotted Ms Ripken and her attacker in the back seat of his car where he had bundled her in, tied up.

The unnamed source confronted the man who said Ms Ripken was his mother and that he was taking her to hospital.

But the source wasn't convinced so called the police who contacted the Aberdeen department to suggest that the car might be linked to their investigation.

For a terrifying 24 hours Ms Ripken's distressed family had no clue as to her whereabouts while police desperately looked for clues.

She was eventually found at around 6am on Wednesday, bound and blindfolded in her car not far from her home.

Police said she appeared unharmed but will undergo medical examination and be interviewed.

For now she is resting in the care of family members who are relieved to have her back.

'This has been a very trying time for our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, safe and healthy,' said a statement released by the Ripken family.

'We want to thank everyone for their tremendous support, especially all of the law enforcement agencies that worked so hard and quickly.'

The abductor, believed to be a white male in his late 30s to early 40s, remains at large.Â 

Ms Ripkin described him as tall and thin and said he was wearing glasses, a light-coloured shirt and camouflage print trousers.

The FBI is also involved in the investigation.

Cal Ripken Jr is a Hall of Fame infielder and earned the nickname 'Iron Man' for playing in 2,632 consecutive games in his 21-year career with the Baltimore Orioles.
