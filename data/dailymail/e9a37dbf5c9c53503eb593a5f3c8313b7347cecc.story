'I like Teddy to talk about the finer things a striker needs to do. We can all do things like shooting practice, but passing his experience on in terms of when you’re in the box is what's important.

'If he talks to them about that. How are you striking the ball, timing or runs - all that sort of stuff. The one on one stuff is more important for him to give to them.

When asked if Sheringham has been important to West Ham's sensational start to the Premier League season which has seen Allardyce's side storm into fourth spot after 17 games, the 60-year-old added he can't be the only to to take credit.
