A town's new brightly-coloured paving slabs could give pedestrians epileptic fits and confuse people with dementia, it was claimed today.

The controversial pavement in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, is now being condemned as hazardous to health and safety because of the pattern and colours of the brick.

According to locals, the 'hypnotising' 
patterns of the brick are also being blamed for an increased number of 
falls on the street.

Crazy paving: Angry pedestrians in Grimsby are claiming that their lives are being put at risk - by a new coloured pavement

North East Lincolnshire's council leader Chris Shaw has denied there is an issue, adding the council had contacted the Epilepsy Society for advice before going ahead with the scheme.

Councillor Steve Beasant believes the pattern could trigger epileptic fits for those with photosensitive epilepsy, a fact he had pointed out to the council before the blocks were laid.

Councillor Beasent, who suffers from epilepsy, said: 'It is a risk to anyone who suffers with photosensitive epilepsy. It's not just strobe lights that can trigger seizures; patterns and shapes can cause it.

'People who suffer from migraine have told me it can trigger one and even those with no health conditions have told me that walking on the paving makes them feel nauseous.

'I don't want to be alarmist, but NELC should have consulted with the Falls Collaborative. No one consulted with them before they were laid. That's my major concern.

'I'm concerned that, as a result, the right materials were not put down. They look nice. They look great, but we should have taken advice.'

The controversial block paving is being condemned as hazardous to health and likely to cause epileptic seizures because of the pattern and colours of the brick

Reports from carers of those with dementia also claim that many sufferers perceive the black blocks among other coloured bricks as holes, which they then try to avoid, risking injury in the process.

A spokesman for North East Lincolnshire Falls Collaborative said the group had 'real areas of concern' about the potential risks to the disabled and those with dementia and other conditions.

The concerns are the latest in a long line of complaints about the blocks, which have already come under fire from businesses, residents and taxi drivers, many of whom have branded it a 'waste of money'.

Sylvia Leary said a risk assessment she had carried out in the area had revealed a lack of drop-kerbs, making the area difficult to navigate for the disabled.

The hope facilitator said she was 'disappointed' NELC had not consulted the Falls Collaborative before laying the new multi-coloured paving, especially as it had previously regularly sought advice from the group on highways issues.

Mrs Leary said: 'NELC is probably doing it to make Freeman Street look prettier, and it is a big improvement there, but there are some areas which are quite disappointing. There are lessons to be learned from this.'

Marathon runner Surinder Fowler said: 'I run up and down there every day, but the new black and white paths have made it really difficult and I've fallen over twice.

'I now use the back roads and I avoid Freeman Street altogether. I think it was a very bad idea, you can't focus when you're jogging and it makes you feel funny in your head.'

Grimsby MP Austin Mitchell, who said he was 'saddened' to hear there were issues with the paving, but that 'something needs to be done'.

Austin said: 'I thought the paving was pretty attractive, but it is a real concern if it is affecting people with epilepsy and other health problems.

'I don't know what can be done. Maybe the pattern could be altered? Clearly, they must do something.'
