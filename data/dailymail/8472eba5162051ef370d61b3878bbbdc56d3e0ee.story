Fight: Tennessee family is fighting to get back their 9-year-old adopted daughter Sonya, pictured, after a judge ordered her to be returned to her biological father following his release from prison

A Tennessee family is fighting to get back the 9-year-old girl they adopted after a judge ordered her to be returned to her biological father following his release from prison.

Sonya was adopted by Dickson County couple Kim and David Hodgin in 2006, when she was just 3 years old. But she's now been taken back to her native Nebraska with Josh McCaul, the father she doesn't know, after a Tennessee appeals court overturned the adoption.

The distraught Hodgins said they were given just two hours' notice before the young girl was taken from them.

McCaul claims his parental rights were illegally terminated when he was in prison.

The father was awarded custody of his
 infant daughter in 2004 after Sonya's mother gave up her rights, 
according to Tennessee Court of Appeals documents cited by the Tennessean.

Due
 to a 'busy work schedule,' he hired someone to watch his daughter in 
July 2005 and when the woman asked if she could take Sonya to visit her 
family in Tennessee in September that year, he agreed.

However, Sonya never returned.

By the end of the month, McCaul went to Tennessee to collect his daughter.

But
 the carer's parents contacted Dickson County sheriff's department and 
told them they believed the father 'had a violent history' and was 
coming to Tennessee to take the child back.

It's unclear whether McCaul did in fact have a violent history at that point and it is also unknown whether he had harmed the infant in the past.Â 

But Detective Amy Longtin stopped McCaul from taking Sonya back and called the Department of Children's Services.

The
 next month, the Dickson County Juvenile Court placed Sonya in the carer's parents' home but soon after she went to live with Kim 
Hodgin, a co-worker of the carer's mother, and her husband.

In October 2005, McCaul was arrested for possession of firearms and the following April he was indicted of federal charges, remaining in custody.

Later that year, the Hodgins petitioned Dickson County Chancery Court to adopt Sonya, claiming both her biological parents had abandoned her - McCaul, because he was in prison - and therefore their parental rights should be terminated.

The court agreed, citing McCaul's 15-year sentence.

In 2009, McCaul won an appeal claiming he did not voluntarily give up his rights and the court did not follow due process in the adoption proceedings.

The Hodgins have tried to have Sonya, who has been in Nebraska two weeks now, returned to them but on Wednesday Juvenile Court Judge Andrew Jackson refused.

'This is not a best interest determination,' he said. 'If the child has not been neglected, I have to return the child to the parent.'

DCS spokesman Rob Johnson told the Tennessean that while foster parents often come to love the children in their care, the law is clear, 'Birth parents have the right to raise their children.'

The Hodgins created a 'Bring Sonya Home' Facebook page on February 4 and are begging friends, family and willing strangers to sign an online petition demanding Sonya be returned. It had garnered more than 7,200 signatures by Tuesday and the Facebook page has more than 6,900 'Likes.'
