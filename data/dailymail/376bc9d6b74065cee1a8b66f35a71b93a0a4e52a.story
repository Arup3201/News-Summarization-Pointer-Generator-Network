Maigstrates could move to end the ancient tradition of swearing on the Bible to tell the truth in court.

Instead, witnesses and defendants would pledge not to lie without mentioning God – and could be jailed if they are caught out.

Critics say the controversial plan would undermine Britain’s Christian heritage.

Oath: Magistrates are considering scrapping the tradition of swearing on the Bible to tell the truth in court

The Magistrates’ Association, which represents 23,000 lay magistrates, will this month discuss concerns that many people do not take the oath seriously. If its policy committee approves the changes it will draft proposals to send to the Ministry of Justice.

Ian Abrahams, 62, a Bristol magistrate who proposed scrapping the oath, said: ‘More and more I see people shrug their shoulders or say “whatever” when asked to take it.

‘I’m suggesting we take holy books out of the process. Instead, people will have to show they understand they could be sent to prison if they don’t tell the truth.

'I don’t intend my motion to make any comment on religion. It is certainly not anti-religious.’

There is already an option for non-believers to take a secular oath, while those of other faiths can swear on their own holy texts.

But church leaders warned that the measure would be seen as eroding the country’s Christian foundations.

The
Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, former Bishop of Rochester, said: ‘This could
be the slippery slope towards the increasing secularisation of society.
Where will it end – with the Coronation Oath?

‘The
Bible is bound up with the constitution, institutions and history of 
this country. It is right for people to have a choice of oath, a 
religious or non-religious one.

‘But we are being urged, in the name of tolerance and secularisation, to restrict that choice.’

The
Rev Arun Arora, director of communications for the Church of England, 
added: ‘Given that the last census showed almost 60 per cent of 
respondents self-identified as Christians and two thirds as people of 
faith, this proposal seems to ignore the statistical reality that we 
remain a faithful nation.

‘This kind of proposal seems driven more by blinkered campaigning agendas than abiding interests in justice and truth.’

John Glen, Tory MP for Salisbury and a magistrate until last year, said: ‘This smacks of political correctness gone mad.’

Legal expert Lord Carlile said: ‘It would be unacceptable for the choice to take a religious oath to be removed.’

For
hundreds of years Christian witnesses have been required to hold the 
Bible and state: ‘I swear by almighty God that I shall tell the truth, 
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.’

Followers
of other faiths are given copies of their sacred texts with, for 
example, Muslims swearing on the Koran and Jews on the Old Testament.

Under
Mr Abrahams’ proposal, the holy books would be removed and the oath 
would read: ‘I promise very sincerely to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth and I understand that if I fail to do so I 
will be committing an offence for which I will be punished and may be 
sent to prison.’

A Ministry
of Justice spokesman said: ‘We have no plans to change the arrangements
for swearing an oath or making an affirmation in court, which have 
worked well for many years and still do.’
