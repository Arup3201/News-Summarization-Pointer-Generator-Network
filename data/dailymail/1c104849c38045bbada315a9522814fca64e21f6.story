A father was found slumped over his steering wheel unconscious after overdosing on heroin while driving his two young children and wife on a highway.

Larry Messer, 39, of Harrison, Ohio admitted to injecting himself with heroin before driving onto Interstate 74 on Saturday with his two kids, aged seven months and two, who were seated in the back seat.

After he passed out, his wife, who has not been named, had to grab the steering wheel bringing the car to a stop on the side of the road, according to court documents.

During an inventory search of the car, police found  numerous meth pipes, a spoon, hypodermic needles and a loaded syringe filled with heroin as identified by Messer, according to WCPO.

When officers approached the car, they said they saw a woman who appeared visibly upset standing outside of it and Messer passed out in the driver seat. 

After they realized he appeared to have overdosed on heroin, they contacted paramedics who gave him Narcan, which is an antidote for opiate overdoses, which helped revive him, according to WSMV.

Messer has been charged with two counts of child endangering, possessing drug abuse instruments and illegal use or possession of drug paraphernalia. 

He is currently being held at the Hamilton County Justice Center and is set to appear in court on Monday.
