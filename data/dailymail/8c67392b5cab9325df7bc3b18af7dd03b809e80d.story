For many of us, simply bending over to touch our toes can be a difficult. But it's not a problem for the world's bendiest woman Julia Günthel aka Zlata. In fact, if she wants to touch her toes she can actually do so by twisting her legs up to her head.

Russian-born Zlata can contort herself into the most extreme poses imaginable - and has broken numerous world records for her flexibility.

The former gymnast, who is 5ft 8in, is so flexible she can cram herself into a 50cm squared box.

Unbelievably comfortable: Russian-born Zlata can twist her legs behind her head

Honed her talent: The 27-year-old has been contorting herself into various positions since she was four

The former gymnast said: 'Doing these poses just feels very natural to me'

Record breaker: She has won awards for her flexibility

She said: 'Doing these poses just feels very natural to me. Sometimes it can get a bit uncomfortable if I have to hold a pose for a long time in photo shoots.

'But I think that's like anyone who sits down for a long time - their muscles get stiff.'

The 27-year-old is set to show off her ability at the upcoming International Contortion Convention in Germany, where she now lives. 

Perfected her act: Zlata joined an after-school circus class to turn her talent into a career

'Addicted': Zlata said she has always loved moving her body into different shapes

Performers, trainers and acrobats will meet in Bergisch Gladbach, near Cologne, for workshops, shows and various special events with Zlata billed as the star attraction.

Zlata has been contorting herself since she was four years old. After discovering how much she loved twisting herself into odd shapes, she joined an after-school circus class before turning her talent into a career.

In shape: The 5ft 8in former gymnast said she doesn't need to diet but works out every day to stay supple

Acrobatic: Zlata will show off her moves in workshops and performances at the convention near Cologne

She said: 'As soon as I started doing it I was addicted and I knew this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.'

But it wasn't always so easy as a child as many of Zlata's peers were jealous of her ability.

She explained: 'In Russia being flexible is a very good thing to be because everyone is really into gymnastics. Some of the other girls didn't like how good I was.'

Zlata said she has to work out rigorously every day to stay in shape and maintain her flexibility.

She added: 'I don't really diet but I have to train very hard to keep my muscles in shape and to be as flexible as possible.'
