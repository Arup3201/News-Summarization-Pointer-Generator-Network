Detectives investigating Jimmy Savile have been passed the names of three doctors accused of molesting youngsters, it emerged last night

They abused children at the same hospitals where the late entertainer preyed on young and vulnerable patients, it can be revealed.

One victim told the Mail she was groped aged 12 by a Stoke Mandeville doctor who had a Jim'll Fix It picture on his wall.

Another woman, who named a separate doctor, is convinced there was a 'sex abuse ring' operating at the Buckinghamshire hospital.

There are now demands for a full independent inquiry into how Savile was given easy access to his victims at children's homes and NHS hospitals, as well as at the BBC. So far, no NHS trust has apologised for Savile – despite him being given the keys to Broadmoor, a bedroom room at Stoke Mandeville and free rein of Leeds General Infirmary.

As the list of his victims grew, a former Stoke Mandeville nurse yesterday waived her anonymity to tell how Savile assaulted her in her bedroom, while a hospital volunteer said the star raped her while wearing a 'Sex instructor, first lesson free' T-shirt.

Former nurse Helen Wakeling said Savile shoved her on to a bed and tried to molest her. Mrs Wakeling, 59, of South West London, said: 'One afternoon in 1973, I came off duty at about 4.30 and bumped into Jimmy Savile and I invited him round to the nurses' quarters for a cup of tea. I made him tea in my room, and the next thing I know he pushed me on to the bed and jumped on top of me.

'I was so shocked, but I was 20 and a Londoner and I just said to him, “What do you think you're doing?” 'He was trying to grope me, but I shouted at him and pushed him off. He stood up and said he was “only joking”, but obviously he wasn't.'

There are already accusations Savile had at least one accomplice at the BBC, and at Top of the Pops, he allegedly ran a 'gang of four' – staff including a cameraman who were part of the paedophile scandal.

Abuse: Sir Jimmy Savile at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in September 2003

But Pete Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said the NHS was a major line of inquiry. He said: 'We have had several calls alleging abuses by doctors at the same hospitals that Savile worked at. This is much bigger than we thought.'

One woman said her Stoke Mandeville doctor sexually abused her every fortnight for four years from the age of 14. She said: 'There is no doubt in my mind there was a sex abuse ring operating at Stoke Mandeville. It is no coincidence that this man was doing the same thing as Jimmy Savile.'

She said the doctor operated on her at the hospital after a burns accident, and she then attended his follow-up clinics at a separate hospital.

Now 52, she recalled: 'He called me his “special patient”. I had to go and see him once every fortnight for cortisone injections under the skin.' But the doctor insisted he needed to 'massage' the fluid into her body in her groin area, she said.

She reported it to her teachers and her mother but said no one took her allegations seriously. The doctor accused by the woman has since died.

A second woman told the Mail she was abused by a Stoke Mandeville consultant paediatrician called Dr Michael Salmon, at his clinic on another site. In 1990, Salmon was jailed for three years after admitting indecent assaults on two 13-year-old girls and a 16-year-old girl.

The woman told the Mail: 'I was so shocked but I didn't know what to do, and I never told anyone. But he had a Jim'll Fix It picture on his sideboard and he worked at Stoke Mandeville, so now I wonder if there was any connection with Savile.'

A third doctor has also been implicated in Leeds.

A spokesman for Stoke Mandeville said: 'We have been shocked and saddened to hear of the very serious allegations about Jimmy Savile dating back to the 1970s. We have no record of any complaints of this nature and would have taken swift and decisive action if this had formally been raised with us.'

The Crown Prosecution Service yesterday faced questions over why it let Savile off the hook three years ago despite a 'clear pattern' of claims against him. Keir Starmer QC announced a review of why four cases were dropped at the end of a two-year probe involving two police forces in 2009.

The Director of Public Prosecutions said he believed the right decision was taken and the internal inquiry will take place out of an 'abundance of caution'.
