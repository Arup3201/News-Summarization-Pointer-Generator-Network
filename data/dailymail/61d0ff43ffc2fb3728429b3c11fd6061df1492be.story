A  couple who skipped out on their bill at a restaurant have returned to pay for their expensive three-course meal after being shamed in a social media campaign.

Owners of Mojos restaurant in Bunbury, Western Australia, Juliana Frisina and Noel Brunning took to Facebook to share a CCTV image in a bid to track down the 'dine and dash' pair who walked out without paying a $230 bill on Saturday night.

The French couple allegedly ordered and ate an extravagant  meal and wine, told the waiters they were going for a cigarette and left a wallet on the table for assurance while they stepped outside.

But the diners never returned and when the waitress picked up the wallet she found the words ‘bad mother***er’ from the 1994 movie Pulp Fiction ironically embossed on its underside.

Mojos restaurant posted an online search warrant for this couple after allegedly walking out without paying

The pair, who worked at a nearby farm in Manjimup on a working holiday visa, returned to the restaurant on Thursday to apologise and pay for their bill.

After grabbing national headlines, the restaurant revealed not only were the duo  slapped with embarrassment but they were both sacked at their farming jobs shortly after the incident.

But the owners of Mojos said they decided not to charge the couple.

'We have been working hard today to get our "Dine & Dash " couple to come & pay their bill , when we discovered their whereabouts in Manjimup,' the Facebook post read on Thursday.

'We didn't want them charged we felt they had, had enough justice as the Farmer who employed them, promptly sacked them & told them to rectify the situation. Which they have now done with some embarrassment.

'We are very proud to be part of such a great chase around Australia. Which ultimately lead to all of Australia "Dishing " out justice, & we the small business owner getting a small win all because of everyone's support.

The bill settlement follows after the establishment's owners posted a search warrant for the pair on social media on Sunday, which quickly went viral.

‘WANTED YOUNG FRENCH COUPLE. Could the young French couple who skipped paying their bill last night come back today & rectify the situation,’ the Facebook post read on Sunday.

‘You have very identifiable tattoos & nose rings & work in a nearby farm. Man was heavily tattooed & the female had septum piecing in her nose.

‘We will get the footage off the security cameras & take to the Police tomorrow if you haven't settled your account by tonight ,’ they warned.

Mojos status warned the couple that they have 'very identifiable tattoos and nose rings'

After recieving an 'overwhelming' response from the local community they thanked everyone for their help

The post was shared thousands of times and has now been seen by almost 30,000 people after the couple failed to return so the owners also posted a grainy CCTV image of the pair on Facebook.

The image showed a man wearing a purple t-shirt and blue shirt, while a blonde woman was dressed in a black strappy top.

‘Wanted. This French Couple who skipped their substantial bill on Saturday 21st Feb at Mojo's. Anyone seen them, call Mojo's or CrimeStoppers. 1800333000,’ the update read.

Co-owner Ms Frisina told Daily Mail Australia: ‘They had a lovely time with their food and drink.

'It was a substantial amount for a couple.’

The French couple reportedly ordered a 'substantial' three-course meal from Mojos 

'It's the one that says bad motherf*****': The wallet the couple left on the table was reminiscent of the one Samuel L. Jackson owns in Pulp Fiction

The diners came for a three-course-meal at Mojos where the owners say 'most people are pretty honest'

She said she never expected the post to go viral, usually the restaurant’s Facebook updates only receive a few hundred ‘likes’.

‘We didn’t expect it to go out like it did, it quickly surpassed 10,000 views and is now up past 30,000.

‘We were just astounded at the community support, the way people jumped to support,’ Ms Frisina said.

‘This couple were intent on leaving. They left a couple of times for smokes out the front and then made a big show about leaving the wallet on the table, which turned out to be empty.

‘We don’t know who they are we only know they are French because they were conversing with our French waitress, they told her they were working in a farm,’ Ms Frisina explained.

Mr Brunning and Ms Frisina reported the incident to local police.

‘Most people are pretty good and usually it’s a genuine mistake when someone runs away from a cup of coffee… most people are pretty honest,’ Ms Frisina said.
