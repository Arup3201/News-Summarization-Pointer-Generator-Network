An Australian woman has spoken out claiming that Rolf Harris groped her in 2008 while they were posing for a photograph at a function.

Louise Anton, from West Australia, has said that when she objected to being groped by Rolf Harris was told by the veteran entertainer 'Yeah but it feels good, dunnit?', it's been alleged.

Harris was found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK between 1968 and 1986 on Monday. He is due to be sentenced on Friday and the judge has warned him that he will probably receive a jail sentence.

Another 15 women have claimed the former TV presenter harassed them in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Malta dating back to the late 1960s, including Louise Anton from Western Australia who has spoken publicly for the first time in the wake of Harris's conviction in London, telling Sky News UK that the entertainer indecently assaulted her in Australia in 2008.

'I know first-hand how quickly he can move and he knows exactly what he's doing,' Ms Anton told Sky News.

'I could feel as plain as day his hand running down my back and it rested on the top of my bottom.

'And then he slid his fingers down in between, and did that several times, and I just couldn't believe what was happening.'

Ms Anton, from Perth, said she glared at Harris and said: 'Are you right?'

'He looked at me and said "Yeah but it feels good, dunnit?" with this smirk on his face. Everything just started spinning and I just couldn't believe this had happened,' said Ms Anton.

Other Australian women have come forward claiming Harris assaulted them.

Former Perth radio host Jane Marwick claims the celebrity grabbed her breast in 2001 while posing for a photo after an interview.

At the time Ms Marwick thought it was 'inappropriate behaviour by a grubby old man' but said if she'd known Harris allegedly abused people 'of very tender years' she would have taken action.

Former ABC radio host Verity James also alleged Harris groped her in the late 1990s or early 2000s.

'He kind of pushes you up against a wall in a big hug, grabbing at the buttocks and rubbing on your breasts,' Ms James said in late May.Â

'I feel gutted and dismayed but it's very important that we do everything we humanly can to protect vulnerable young people,' Mr Abbott told ABC radio about Rolf Harris's guilty verdict.

'Sexual abuse is an utterly abhorrent crime,' Mr Abbott said.

'It's just sad and tragic that this person who was admired seems to have been a perpetrator.'

Harris was found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK between 1968 and 1986 on Monday. He is due to be sentenced on Friday.

Three of the counts Rolf Harris was convicted on this week pertained to Tonya Lee, a 43-year-old Australian, who told the court that Rolf Harris fondled her on a visit to London when she was 15.As she sat on his lap in a pub, Harris, then 56, indecently touched her.

Terrified, she fled to the toilets but when she emerged, he pinned her up to a wall and molested her.

'I don't know how he sleeps at night,' she told A Current Affair in May.

'He touched me, he fondled me, I was absolutely petrified and I just wanted to scream but I didn't.

'He must be able to switch between two personalities like a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde sort of thing.'

Traumatised, Ms Lee stopped eating and then endured a 16-year battle with anorexia, alcoholism and bulimia. Ms Lee later attempted to end her life with a cocktail of laxatives and alcohol.

Australian producer Paul Redman, told Sky News he worked with Harris on a number of shows and knew of his wandering hands.

He would reportedly warn female colleagues to stay clear of the star they nicknamed 'the octopus'.

'I used to warn girls, "Just look, be careful,"' Mr Redman said.

'Don't go for the cuddle at the end because he has been known to grope.'

The producer revealed that not many women believed him 'and unfortunately to their detriment that's why I know six girls who have been touched by Rolf'.

The allegations come as it has emerged that the jury in Rolf Harris's child sex abuse trial didn't get to hear from a further nine women who claim the entertainer harassed them.

The prosecution wanted to call seven of the women as bad character witnesses alongside six others who did give evidence during the eight-week trial in London.

But most were ruled inadmissible during legal argument at Southwark Crown Court.

Justice Nigel Sweeney didn't allow jurors to see footage of one English TV presenter who claimed Harris put his hand up her skirt while she was interviewing him live on air in the mid-1990s.

During pre-trial legal argument, prosecutor Sasha Wass QC said watching the footage it was clear from the woman's reaction what was going on just out of shot.

One potential witness claims she was working as a barmaid at a party for the broadcaster Michael Parkinson in 2005 when Harris kissed her in front of his wife Alwen.

Harris allegedly grabbed the young woman as she was clearing up and started kissing her.

A decade earlier, in the mid-1990s, the star attended a fete at Bray where he's lived since the early 1980s.

He was allegedly in a tent signing autographs when he told a 13 or 14-year-old girl he liked her jumper and wanted to see what was under it.

In 1991, another potential bad character witness met Harris during an art class in Belfast when she asked if she could interview him for the BBC.

With children and a camera crew watching the artist allegedly pressed himself against her and stuck his tongue into her mouth.

'She felt disgusted and dirty and described him as opportunistic and predatory,' Ms Wass told the court during pre-trial legal argument.

In 2001, a 20-year-old woman who looked younger than that allegedly met Harris at an art competition at Kensington Olympia.

The celebrity pinched her bottom as they posed for a photograph, the court but not the jury heard.

She looked at him angrily, but he simply shrugged. A 24-year-old with psychological problems was allegedly abused in 1999 when she met Harris while on holiday with friends.

'In the villa he was staying in he came upon her in the garden, put his hand inside her skirt and touched her buttocks,' Ms Wass said.

'On another occasion he came to where she was staying, went into her room while she was having a nap and got into bed with her.'

The court heard he digitally penetrated her, performed oral sex on her and got her to do the same to him.

Finally, a woman says she met the Australian at a motel near Sydney in 1977.

She was 14 and Harris was visiting with fellow celebrity Harry Butler.

The alleged victim says Harris touched her bottom and declared: 'Rolfie deserves a cuddle.'

He subsequently followed her to a lift where he held her and touched her breast before she managed to escape.

Rolf Harris has been kicked out of the ARIA Hall of Fame after being convicted of sexual abuse.

ARIA chief executive Dan Rosen told AAP on Tuesday that the board had decided to withdraw the award following his conviction in the UK courts.

Harris was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame, which acknowledges artists for their contributionto the culture of the Australian music industry, in 2008.

The entertainer was also stripped of his BAFTA Fellowship and his CBE from the queen.
