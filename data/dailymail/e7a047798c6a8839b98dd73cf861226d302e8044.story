When Sam Faiers stepped into the Celebrity Big Brother house last week, she showcased a toned new figure in a flattering white jumpsuit.

The TOWIE star lost a staggering 23lbs in the build-up the the Channel 5 show - but not without hard work.

The 23-year-old, who reveals she piled on weight by comforting eating when in a relationship, has lost almost two stone on a gruelling diet and exercise regime.

Sam has slimmed from 10st 2lbs at her 
peak to 8st 7lbs - losing three inches off her waist and shrinking from a
 size 10 to a size 8.

She's the biggest loser! Sam Faiers slimmed from 10st 2lbs to 8st 7lbs - losing three inches off her waist and shrinking from a size 10 to a size 8 - in preparation for her appearance in Celebrity Big Brother

Revealing new bikini pictures taken just before she went into Big Brother, Sam said she had piled on the pounds when she was with former boyfriend Joey Essex because she enjoyed the 'comfort' of being in a relationship.

In an interview with Heat magazine, Sam said: 'He was super skinny and could eat what he wanted and not put on any weight.

As she was: Sam, pictured (L) in March 2012 and (R) entering the house on Friday, said she comfort ate when she was in a relationship with Joey Essex and decided to lose weight after seeing bikini shots of herself 

'It was completely different for me because the weight does quickly show on me. I've always had chubby cheeks and when I put on weight, it goes to my face, neck and tummy. My face goes a bit puffy.'

She revealed the trigger point that sparked her new healthier regime was the split with Joey and some bikini pictures of her taken in Marbella in the summer.

She said: 'I looked so horrible and didn't feel comfortable about my body at all. I remember seeing one picture of me eating a cheese sandwich and I just cried. I thought: "I want to lose that tummy." I feel like I let myself go a little bit.

'It happens when you are in a relationship - they do make you put on weight. I was very comfortable in a relationship and I guess that affected my weight.

'We'd both eat the same things and I'd end up putting on weight and he wouldn't.

Comfort: Sam said she and Joey (pictured together, left) would eat lots of takeaways but he'd never put on weight. She was speaking in an interview with Heat magazine, out now

'My weak points were Chinese takeaways - particularly my favourite chicken chow mein - and crisps and biscuits. I could easily have three digestive biscuits with a cup of tea.'

Sam's heartache diet combined no carbs, little alcohol and punishing interval training three times a week with her personal trainer. She switched to healthier meals such as porridge, chicken salads and prawn stir-fries.

And she has also cut out all that damaging snacking by taking Forza Supplements’ Raspberry K2 diet pills.

The 5ft 6in star said: 'If I start reaching for the biscuit tin or the crisps, I just take one of the Forza K2 capsules and it satisfies my craving. They give me that little bit of extra help in getting in shape - they are like a diet in a bottle.

Popular housemate: Sam is 7-2 second favourite to win Celebrity Big Brother behind Made In Chelsea star Ollie Locke whose odds are 7-4

'They are great when you are feeling a bit peckish in the hour before lunch or in the middle of the afternoon.'

Sam - recently voted Best Bikini Body - is thrilled with her new figure.

Speaking just before she went on Big Brother, Sam said: 'I just feel so much better and have lots more energy. I guess there are some good bits about being single!

'I didn't need to lose a lot of weight - I just needed to tone up my body and put a bit of muscle on. I'll always be a curvy girl and I will never be skinny. I am quite happy with that.'

But her waist isn't the only thing that has shrunk. Sam has revealed how her boobs have got smaller since losing the weight, shrinking from 32DD to a 32C.
