Robots already live amongst us, but should they have the same rights as humans and should we be allowed to torture them?

They may sound like questions from science fiction films but these are the kinds of question that will need to be answered in the not too distant future.

BBC reports that Kate Darling, a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is truly fond of experimenting and isn't afraid to do terrible things to silly robots.

Robotic feelings: Aww, look how cute he looks. But remember, it's only a robot!

Robot ethics: Kate Darling (pictured), a researcher at MIT asks as we form such strong emotional bonds with machines that people can¿t be cruel to them even though they know they are not alive. So should robots have rights?

He's smiling and he loves you: Watching Pleo the dinosaur being tortured prompts strong physiological and emotional reactions in people

As a part of her psychology experiment, Darling offered people to play with a Pleo robot, a toy dinosaur for children.

The cute soft Pleo has trusting eyes and affectionate movements. When you take it out of the pack, it is like a newborn puppy – it can’t walk and you have to teach it everything.

But after an hour of hugs and affection, Darling changes her tune. She gives the participants knives, hatchets and other weapons, and orders to torture and dismember their toys.

What happens next 'is much more dramatic than we ever anticipated,' she says. Most of the participants refused to go along with her orders.

Under the surface: Perhaps if Pleo didn¿t have its soft skin, might it be easier to see the bot as the machine it is, made up of metal, wires and bits of plastic?

For Darling, our reaction to robot cruelty is important because a new wave of machines is forcing us to reconsider our relationship with them.

When Darling described her Pleo experiment at a lecture, she made the case that mistreating certain kinds of robots could soon become unacceptable and abusive in the eyes of society.

She even believes that we may need a set of 'robot rights'.

Until not long ago, the idea of robot rights had been left to the science fiction writers.

Perhaps that’s because the machines around us have been unsophisticated.

Nobody feels anxious about throwing away a toaster or a remote-control toy car, the situation changes when it comes to modern so-called 'social robots'.

They display autonomous behavior, show interest and act familiar to pets or babies, as if they are alive, which triggers our emotions, and often we can’t help it, adds Darling.

Emotional: After an hour allowing people to tickle and cuddle these loveable dinosaurs, Darling turned executioner. She gave the participants knives, hatchets and other weapons, and ordered them to torture and dismember their toys

Partners: It's easy to become attached to robots that appear to have human-like qualities

Playing to your emotions: In an experiment where children held a Furby upside down, even children couldn¿t stand the way it was programmed to cry and say 'Me scared'

In an experiment conducted in 2011, children were asked to hold upside down a Barbie doll, a hamster and a Furby toy for as long as they felt comfortable.

While the children held the doll upside down until their arms got tired, they soon stopped torturing the wriggling hamster, and after a little while, the Furby too.

They were old enough to know the Furby was a toy, but couldn’t stand the way it was programmed to cry and say 'Me scared'.

Some people give names to their vacuum cleaners, says Darling. Soldiers honor their robots with 'medals' or hold funerals for them.

She cites one particularly striking example of a military robot who was created in order to defuse landmines by stepping on them.

Cause for concern? Robots may appear to have human-like qualities, but could you ever bring it upon yourself to physically torture them?

What a cute dog! Until recently, the idea of robot rights had been left to the realms of science fiction. Perhaps that¿s because the real machines surrounding us have been relatively unsophisticated

Number five is alive! 27 years after Short Circuit came out, researchers are converging on the idea that if a robot looks like it is alive, we feel empathy towards them, even though we know they are artificial

In a test, the explosions ripped off most of the robot’s legs, and yet the crippled machine continued to limp along.

Watching the robot struggle, the colonel in charge called off the test because it was 'inhumane'.

Another experiment was conducted by the researchers from the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany.

They used machines to track people’s reactions to a video of somebody torturing a robotic pet – choking it, putting it inside a plastic bag or striking it.

The physiological and emotional responses they measured were much stronger than expected, although they were aware of watching a robot.

MIT researcher asks if we become attached to our robots, can we avoid having human emotions towards them?

Experiments involved torturing toys after letting children play with them

The kids found it incredibly difficult to destroy the toys as they became attached even after a short time
