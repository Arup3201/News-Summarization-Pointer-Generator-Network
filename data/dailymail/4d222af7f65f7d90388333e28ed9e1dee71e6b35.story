The South African company behind Bumbo Baby Seats is recalling nearly four million seats in response to scores of reported infant injuries including two dozen cases of skull fractures.

In a second blow for the product, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has found that babies can too easily wiggle out of the floor seats leaving themselves vulnerable to injury.

The news follows a previous warning that the seats were dangerous if placed on raised surfaces.

Big mistake: Bumbo International Trust is voluntarily recalling about 4 million Bumbo Baby Seats after reports of scores of injuries, including skull fractures

About 1 million of the molded foam seats
were recalled in October 2007 for additional warning labels against 
placing the Bumbo seats on tables or kitchen 
counters.

Since the first recall, CPSC and Bumbo International of South Africa have learned of at least 50 incidents in which babies fell from Bumbo seats while they were being used on raised surfaces.Â 

Delicate: One million seats were recalled in 2007 for labelling warning against leaving the seats on raised surfaces

CPSC says another 34 babies fell from
the seats while they were being used on the floor or at an unknown 
elevation. In all, there were 21 reports of skull fractures to infants.

Consumers
are asked to stop using the seats and contact Bumbo for a free repair 
kit that includes a restraint belt and instructions on how to safely use
the seat.

The repair kit can be ordered by visiting www.recall.BumboUSA.com or calling 866-898-4999.

The right way: Consumers are being advised to call Bumbo to get a free repair kit that comes with a safety belt

In a statement, the company said it was adding a restraint belt to enhance the safety of children using the Bumbo seat.

'The restraint belt will help prevent children from getting out of or falling from the seat when it is used as intended: on the floor with adult supervision and never on raised surfaces,' said the statement. 'The health and safety of children using the Bumbo Baby Seat are our top priorities.'

The Bumbo floor seats were sold at Babies R Us, Target, Walmart and other retailers nationwide from August 2003 through August 2012.
