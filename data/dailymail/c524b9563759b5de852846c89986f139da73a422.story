Arsenal fans were calling Mesut Ozil’s name at the Emirates during their slender Champions League victory over Besiktas – but not in a good way.

The club’s record signing was the lightning rod for grievances as the tension mounted and he gave possession away more than once with Alexis Sanchez in promising positions.

When Mathieu Debuchy was sent off late on it was Ozil who Arsene Wenger decided would be sacrificed so Calum Chambers could be sent on to shore up defence.

Going nowhere fast: Ozil has yet to make a real impact at Arsenal since his move from Real Madrid last year

Had Ozil been keeping hold of the ball it is likely that, for all his defensive deficiencies, he would have stayed on. Possession is vital in closing out matches and at his best Ozil treats the ball like Gollum does his precious ring to rule them all; protective and unyielding.

But Ozil has been struggling to reach his best in north London. He arrived last summer amid much fanfare and with a £42.5million price tag his form was explosive.

Real Madrid players lined up to complain that their team’s creative spark had been sold – Cristiano Ronaldo was particularly critical – and the deal looked a steal when Ozil scored a sublime opener in early October’s Champions League victory over Napoli.

He was the grandstand signing Arsenal fans had been crying out for during years of frugality from Wenger, keen to balance the books with a new stadium to pay for.

Wenger threw off the shackles for Ozil and the German supplied assists in kind – as well as a decent goal return of five goals in 18 games before Christmas.

But the lack of a winter break to which he had become accustomed in Germany appeared to deeply affect the 25-year-old of slight stature.

There was fatigue in his game and a hamstring injury in March that kept him out for a month. He scored only two goals in his final 22 games.

As he edged to fitness in April, Wenger revealed: ‘He had a period where he was tired because he was not used to playing a full season.

'He's a fantastic football player and I would put him on the list to be player of the season next season.’

A World Cup where he starred for Germany followed, even if at times he was criticised for failing to impact matches throughout. In the early rounds, he would flirt with providing a lasting contribution. More often, though, he sparkled brightly but briefly.

His best performance came against Algeria in the last-16 when he scored. He was also excellent in the 7-1 humbling of Brazil although the headlines were elsewhere.

It seemed he had his mojo back but his two appearances for Arsenal this season have been subdued. It might be that he still needs an extended break to recharge the batteries following a summer that provided him with little opportunity.

Sanchez’s arrival takes some of the focus away and you imagine he will thrive with better players around him. At Madrid, he had the likes of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Gonzalo Higuain to feed.

All three are hulking forwards who enjoy making runs in behind defences. Arsenal are short on that type of player and perhaps Ozil’s ability to slot passes through the eye of a needle for quick strikers to run onto cannot be harnessed in full in Wenger’s side.

A statistic went round the internet in the wake of Angel Di Maria’s arrival at Manchester United. To justify his huge fee it was noted he had made 49 league assists in the league since 2010, the third-most of any player in Europe behind Lionel Messi on top with 57.

Lodged in between them was Ozil, who has laid on 56 goals. It is that kind of world-class contribution that convinced Wenger to splash the cash and it is what he now needs to bring out of his player once more.
