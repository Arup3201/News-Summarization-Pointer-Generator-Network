Michael Feldmen, husband of NBC host Savannah Guthrie and a first-time dad-to-be, has undertaken a 'Daddy Boot Camp' segment on his wife's The Today Show, just two months before the birth of the couple's first child.

Mr Feldman, 45, a Washington D.C. communications strategist, took a trip to the Northshore University Hospital in New York, along with friend and Today host Willie Geist, to speak with a labor and delivery nurse.

'They say nothing really prepares you for parenthood, I think that's definitely true,' Mr Geist - himself a father-of-two - remarks. 'But I tried at least to give my buddy Mike a little Cliffs Notes version of early fatherhood before that little delivery arrives in a couple of months.'

No weight worries: Ms Guthrie, pictured earlier this month, recently revealed that she has so far gained 30lbs during her pregnancy, which her OB/GYN advised her not to 'worry' about

The first and foremost rule in the delivery room? 'Make her happy, make her comfortable — [that’s the] most important thing to do,' Nurse Ellen Benz, advises, as Mr Feldman nods eagerly.

'The biggest mistake is apologizing when mom is yelling,' Ms Benz continues. 'Just agree with her.' Both Mr Feldman and Mr Geist wear expressions of undeniable trepidation as the lesson continues.

Next, Mr Geist enthusiastically assumes the position of a woman in labor, lying back on the bed, his legs akimbo, while a visibly nervous but notably focused Mr Feldman appears busy taking mental notes.

'When it's time to push, grab a leg - she'll be screaming at you - just "Yes" her to death,' instructs Ms Benz, as Mr Feldman repeats 'Yes! Yes!' emphatically, much to the amusement of Mr Geist, who seems to be rather enjoying his role-play scenario.

Once the fictional baby is 'born', it's onto the next set of lessons. Mr Feldman is handed a doll, repeatedly forgetting to 'support its neck', despite several reminders, and struggles comically with attaching a diaper.

'At this point,' says Ms Benz as Mr Feldman scrabbles to 'change' the doll, 'the baby will be peeing on you.'

United: Savannah looked radiant sporting a snug green dress as she clutched the hand of her husband

Presumably much to his relief, the final part of the segment see's Mr Feldman reunited with his wife Savannah, who is positively glowing, dressed in a stretchy lime green dress.

The happy couple clutch hands for a quick chat with Terry Crews, an actor and author of Manhood, and Amar'e Stoudemire, a basketball player for the New York Knicks, both of them fathers.

Mr Feldman is advised to 'make time' for his child, 'read to him or her before bedtime' and 'Skype with his family' when he's away from home.

'What about back massages for the wife?' Savannah gamely interjects, closing the segment.

'I'm so happy to be able to call him my husband, it's still strange saying "my husband", but great'

The couple first met in 2008 when Savannah attended Mr Feldman's 40th birthday party with a mutual friend and they began dating a few months later.

They got engaged last May during a trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands, and tied the knot in March outside Ms Guthrie's home town of Tucson, Arizona, without publicizing the event to media.

During the course of the evening the newlyweds privately announced to family and friends that they were expecting a child.

Savannah later went public with her 'surprise' wedding and pregnancy news on the Today show.

After marrying her husband, Savannah said: 'I'm so happy to be able to call him my husband, it's still strange saying "my husband", but great.'

The couple have chosen not find out the sex of their baby until it is born in August, and it has not yet been revealed who will fill in for Savannah on the Today show during her maternity leave.
