A German clothes firm favoured by neo-Nazis has provoked outrage for calling its new store Brevik - which critics say is in honour of right-wing Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik.

Thousands of people have complained about the store in Chemnitz which, although not spelled the same, is frequented by the radical right who like to wear its Thor Steinar-brand clothes.

'This scandalous choice of name has shown a new level of aggression, and violent right-wing tendencies from Thor Steinar,' said Hanka Kliese of the Social Democratic Party.

Outrage: The firm did have a store called Brevik, named after the Norwegian town, in Hamburg but it shut in 2008

The chain has defended itself by pointing out that it names all its branches after the village of Brevik, south of Oslo.

But critics say this is not enough to explain the choice of a name almost identical to that of Norwegian right-wing extremist who murdered 77 people in a shooting spree on a holiday island in Norway in July last year.

'It is out of the question for a store to have a name like that,' city spokeswoman Katja Uhlemann told Die Welt's website.

Anders Behring Breivik was today indicted on terror and murder charges for his bomb and murder rampage.

But prosecutors said it was likely the confessed killer would not go to prison for Norway's worst peacetime massacre.

They said they considered the 33-year-old to be psychotic and would seek a sentence of involuntary commitment to psychiatric care.

This would happen, instead of imprisonment, unless new information about his mental health emerges during the trial set to start in April.

As expected, they charged him under a paragraph in Norway's anti-terror law that refers to violent acts intended to disrupt key government functions or spread fears in the population.

He has confessed to the July 22 attacks but denies criminal guilt, portraying the victims as 'traitors' for embracing immigration policies he claims will result in an Islamic colonisation of Norway.

'We have already contacted the landlord and will plan every step necessary to shut down this business as quickly as possible.'

Saxony, the state in which Chemnitz 
lies, has been making headlines in recent months because of the National
Socialist Underground.

It is a neo-Nazi terrorist cell that 
murdered 10 people over 13 years.

The group lived for a time in both 
Chemnitz and nearby Zwickau during their years in hiding.

Thor Steinar is favoured by right-wing thugs.

Norway has long sought to distance itself from the German brand, which has used the Norwegian flag and other Nordic symbols on its products.

'We consider it very regrettable that Thor Steinar uses Norwegian place names in order to associate Norway as such with Thor Steinar and the extreme right-wing scene,' said Anne-Kirsti Wendel Karlsen of the Norwegian Embassy in Berlin.

'Acting at the request of a number of communities, we have asked that Norwegian town names not be used.

'But we unfortunately have no legal recourse to pursue it through the courts.'
