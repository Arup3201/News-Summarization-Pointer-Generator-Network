William the Conqueror: Dr Mari Jones, a leading linguist from Cambridge University, is attempting to preserve the language for the benefit of future generations

The race is on to chronicle the Norman language before it slips into extinction.

A Cambridge University linguist is now studying the dialects of the Channel Islands - one of the last enclaves of Norman French - to ensure it is recorded for posterity.

Native dialects of the language spoken by William the Conquerer are still used by around 3,000 people on the islands.

On Sark they are estimated to number 20, on Guernsey 1,000 and on Jersey 2,000. The dialects on all three islands are distinct.

The language - which is also used in parts of Normandy - is now not spoken fluently by anyone under the age of 30 and is expected to disappear within a generation.

Dr Mari Jones, a leading linguist from Cambridge University, is attempting to preserve the language for the benefit of future generations.

She told MailOnline: 'Language often carries a symbolic force, as an emblem of groupness, a focus of ethnic allegiance and belonging, on a par with other symbols such as a flag or a national anthem.

'This is not work that we can leave until a metaphorical tomorrow: unless considerable support is given to those people working to maintain and preserve the Norman French of the Channel Islands, it will disappear within the next few decades.'

The Norman language has been spoken in the Channel Islands for hundreds of years but began declining in medieval times with the stationing of garrisons of English soldiers in Guernsey and Jersey.

Jèrriais (Jersey Norman French)

Guernésiais (Guernsey Norman French)

Sercquais (Sark Norman French)

Auregnais (Alderney Norman French ) (this dialect became extinct in around the 1950s)

The decline was exacerbated in the 19th century when trade with England increased dramatically with the arrival of steamships.

This, combined with a growing number of tourists, led to English being seen as a means to prosperity and social advancement.

A further blow to the language was the German Occupation of the islands in World War II.

Dr Jones said this led to the evacuation to the UK of large numbers of women and children, the next generation of Norman speakers.

'Five years in the life of a child is a long time, so when they went back they had started to forget Norman French,' she said.

In Jersey the endangered Norman 
dialect, known as Jersey French, is now spoken by just 3.2 per cent of 
the population (an estimated  2,000 people), and in Guernsey their version is spoken 
by just 2.2 per cent (an estimated 1,000 people).

The Unesco Atlas of the World's 
Languages in Danger states that 230 languages reached extinction in the 
past 60 years, and some 3,000 languages are currently endangered.

The name Normandy came because the Vikings were known as 'North men' and the language that evolved was known as Norman

The origins of the language in the Channel Islands come from the Romans after they finally conquered all of Gaul (modern-day France) - as well as the Islands - under Julius Caesar in 51BC.

The language spoken at that time was known as 'Vulgar Latin' ('of the people'). Then, during the ninth and 10th century Vikings began to sweep south from northern Europe for frequent marauding raids along the northern coast of France.

Fed up with the constant harassment, the king of the Francs gave them an area of land which is now modern-day Normandy - and included the Channel Islands.

The name Normandy came because the Vikings were known as 'North men' and the language that evolved was known as Norman.

The language 'Norman' then came to British shores with William the Conqueror when he set foot on Pevensey Bay in September 1066.

From then on it was the language of the aristocracy and other social classes seeking advancement, and is now known as 'Anglo-Norman'. It retained its status until the early 15th century when it mysteriously dropped from use.

Dr Mari Jones of Cambridge University said no-one knows why this was but it could have been because most ordinary people carried on speaking English, whereas 'Anglo-Norman' was only spoken by the aristocracy and written down.

There is one last Norman phrase still in use in Britain to this day.

When a Bill has been passed by the House of Commons and the House of Lords it is given Royal Assent - which means the Queen formally approves it - and the phrase 'la Reyne le veult' (the Queen so wills it) is used.
