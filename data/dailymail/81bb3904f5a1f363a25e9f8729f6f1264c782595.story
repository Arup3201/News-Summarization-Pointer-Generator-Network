A teenage dental student made declarations of love to her friends and family on social networking sites before being killed on a motorway at 4am.

Police are now scouring the Facebook and Twitter messages of Lena Begum, 18, after she was hit by a white Mercedes van on Wednesday.

The youngster had tweeted: 'I just wana say a big thank you ta all my true mate that have been there for me & my family, love ya loads,' and 'Only thing that I would want from ya is ta remember me ya du’as please more than anything else,' before stepping into the path of traffic on the Eastbound carriageway of the M65 near Burnley, Lancs.

The driver of the van, a 48-year-old man from Burnley, was treated for shock.

Lancashire authorities are now trying to establish what Lena, also known as Lena Sheikh, was doing on the motorway in the run up to the tragedy.

Lena's social media accounts show that she was still posting messages at 1.15am - just a few hours prior to the accident.

Previous heartfelt and emotional messages from Lena to her friends include: 'I regret nothing in my life even if my past was full of hurt, I still look back and smile, because it made me who I am today.. :),' which was posted on March 25.

A posting from February 25 read: 'I wish i had cancer.. Cuz i wana leave this sh*tty world && just go ta.'

Her Facebook account has since been shut down.

In a statement the family said: 'Lena was very much loved by all her family, and was a very loving daughter. Lena was her mother’s only daughter and she is especially devastated. Her passing will leave a big hole in the family. She will be deeply missed.'

Tributes to the student poured onto social networks, with one former schoolmate posting: ‘R.I.P Lena Sheikh...Gone too soon...Unbelievable’.

Messages: Lena's Twitter page shows messages of love to those closest to her, shortly before she stepped onto the motorway

On Facebook one friend, Zaynab Mahmood, wrote: “It was not her fault what she was going through, what her family was going through, isn’t anybody’s place to judge, except Allah.' Another wrote: 'R.i.p.. Really upsetting news.. Allah has taken Someone From The Youth Away From This World.. Shows Death can come at anytime.'

The accident happened near the Rosegrove Lane bridge between junctions 9 and 10.

Sgt Tracey Ward of Lancashire Police said: “Although it was in the early hours of the morning, there may have been people driving on the motorway who may have witnessed what happened, or spotted the woman. I would appeal for those people to come forward and get in touch.'

It is unknown how Lena managed to get 
onto that section of the motorway due to fencing which had been erected 
after the motorway death of another teenager in 2007.

Harrison Hartley, 
15, was killed playing ‘chicken’ on the same section of the road after 
walking out in front of the cars.
