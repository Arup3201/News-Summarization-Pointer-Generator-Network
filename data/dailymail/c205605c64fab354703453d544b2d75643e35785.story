The last place you would expect to be able to order a Kentucky Fried Chicken Bargain Bucket would be in Iran.

But, as unlikely as it might sound, KFC has opened its first branch in the country for more than 30 years.

The U.S. fast-food chain has built a restaurant in the city of Karaj in the Alborz province in central Iran.

The opening has taken place despite harsh U.S. sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme.

Amir-Hossein Alizadeh, the licence 
holder, said it took him five years to get permission from the relevant 
local authorities to open the branch.

The
franchise was closed in Iran following the 1979 Islamic revolution, due
to its affiliation with the U.S., the country's political arch-enemy.

Iran last week denied inspectors from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog access to a key military site - ratcheting up tensions between Tehran and the West and effectively ending a working dialogue.

International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) inspectors were turned away from a base in Parchin, south-east of
the capital, where intelligence suggests nuclear weapons could be in 
development.

It led to the UN declaring a two-day 
meeting, intended to calm fears over the Islamic Republic's disputed 
nuclear programme, to be a 'failure'.

And it said talks with Iran are now 
unlikely to be re-started - as the West continues to step up sanctions 
against the major oil producer.
