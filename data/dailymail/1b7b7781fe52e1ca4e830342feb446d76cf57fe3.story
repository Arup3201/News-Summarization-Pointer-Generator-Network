Fans: The Queen and Prince Philip using a Defender in 1968

Jaguar Land Rover yesterday breathed new life into its iconic Defender – a favourite of the Queen.

It confirmed that it will create a new version of the 4x4 and also said the existing model will continue to roll off the production line.

But amid announcements of the firm's £600million investment in the UK it said neither model would be made in Britain.

There had been rumours that a factory would be created in Coventry, possibly to build the revamped Defender.

Manufacture of the current version of the all-terrain vehicle, first made in 1948 and one of the first cars owned by the Queen after she came to the throne in 1952, is due to end in December after a series of special editions roll off the production line. But it is understood that the new model will be built abroad.

A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover, owned by Indian industrial giant Tata, said: 'We will create a new version of the Defender but no decision has been made on where it will be built or when.'

Commenting on the future of the existing model, the spokesman added: 'We are investigating the possibility of maintaining production of the current Defender at an overseas production facility for sale outside of the EU, after we cease building in the UK.'

This could mean it being built at Jaguar Land Rover's factories in Brazil or China. Three-quarters of the two million Defenders built since launch are still in regular use. A prototype of the new generation 4x4 was unveiled in 2011, and yesterday's announcement brings it a step closer.

But at the heart of Jaguar Land Rover's current plans are a £400million revamp of its Castle Bromwich site in the West Midlands, including a £320million body shop to manufacture the XF, the new all-aluminium sports saloon.

The remodelled car was launched earlier this week with a dramatic stunt – being driven on wires over water in London's Docklands.

Jaguar Land Rover also said it was doubling the size of its advanced design and engineering centre in Whitley, Coventry, at a cost of £50million, 'to support the company's creation of high-technology, ultra-low emission vehicles'.

The plans are expected to create thousands more jobs on top of the 32,300 people the firm already employs in the UK.

Jaguar Land Rover is also funding a £150million research complex – the National Automotive Innovation Centre – in partnership with Warwick University. Chief executive Dr Ralf Speth said the venture demonstrated its 'unwavering support to the British automotive industry'.

He added: 'This investment, made here in the heart of our UK business operations, signals the confidence we have in this region to support the creation, engineering and manufacture of ultra low-emission, premium British products.'
