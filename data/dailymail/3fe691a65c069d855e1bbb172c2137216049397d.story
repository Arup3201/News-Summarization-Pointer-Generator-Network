Naomi Broady was comprehensively beaten 6-3 6-2 by former world No 1 Caroline Wozniacki in just 59 minutes on Wednesday.

Wozniacki, who revealed on Tuesday she was not ‘desperate’ enough to try internet dating after splitting up with golfer Rory McIlroy, said: ‘I felt good out there.

‘It was nice to play on a big court, Court No 1. I got to break her early in both sets, which gave me a  cushion. She (Broady) has a big serve and some big ground strokes so it was important to keep focused and keep on top in my service games.

‘It definitely gives me some  confidence. She has the game for grass and I felt like I got a lot of returns in, which was very important. I feel like I’m in good form.

‘I’ve got a few people asking me if I want to date them, but I’m just taking it easy at the moment. I need to be single for a while.’

Broady apologised to Wozniacki when they shook hands at the  net ‘for not giving her a match for her next round’, but said the  experience had given her extra motivation to come back and win on such a big stage. Broady said: ‘I very much enjoyed it, but I didn’t enjoy my tennis. It’s frustrating I didn’t play better, but it’s given me a new drive. I want to play better on there and win on there.’

The Briton also said she was ‘unbothered’ by her long-running dispute with the Lawn Tennis  Association (LTA), who have not funded her since cutting off her support after pictures of a night out appeared on social media seven years ago.

Broady said: ‘Hopefully everyone can move on now. I don’t hate them as people. I’m not going to waste my time hating the LTA — I’m just going to focus on my tennis. They are not really relevant.’
