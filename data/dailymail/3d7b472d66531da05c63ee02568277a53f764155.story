Three men and a youth have appeared in court charged with murder over a house fire which killed four members of the same family.

Shaun Carter, 24, Jackson Powell, 19, and Nathaniel Mullings, also 19, all appeared alongside a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, at Leicester Magistrates' Court.

They each face four charges of murder in relation to a deadly house fire in the Wood Hill area of Leicester in the early hours of Friday, September 13.
