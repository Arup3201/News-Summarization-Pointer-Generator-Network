Two schoolgirls waiting for a bus were showered in blood and guts from a lorry carrying animal carcasses when it hit a bump in the road. 

Lilly Tomlinson-Hulme and Lydia Hopwood had to be collected from school after showing up to class 'smelling of blood and cow'.

The 11-year-old's from Weston Coyney, Staffordshire, said they were 'embarrassed' and 'felt sick all day'. 

An investigation has now been launched by Staffordshire County Council into the incident. 

Lilly Tomlinson-Hulme and Lydia Hopwood were showered in blood and guts as they waited for a school bus when a lorry carrying animal carcasses drove past them and hit a speed bump

'We were waiting for the bus when a really smelly truck came past. 

'I felt this splash of cold, it felt like water. There were stains on me that looked like blood. 

'When I got to school my friends said I stank of blood and cow. I was a bit embarassed, I felt sick all day,' said Lilly. 

The 11-year-old's mother was horrified when the girls' school called to tell her her daughter was 'covered in blood'. 

'It was awful. I got a phone call from the school to say my daughter was covered in blood on her hands and face. I couldn't believe what I was hearing,' said Claire Hulme. 

'Lilly was a little bit upset, but once she had a bath she was not too bad. But it is a bit embarrassing to have to go to school covered in blood.

The 11-year-old's were sent home from school 'smelling like blood and cow'

'I had to wash her school uniform twice to get rid of the smell of blood.

'Apparently 17 wagons went through Weston Road on Thursday morning.

'But if children are getting hit with blood when they are waiting for a bus then something needs to be done about it.'

Lydia's mother described it as a 'public health issue', adding: 'Lydia sent me a text to say something really horrible had happened. 

'I thought she was exaggerating but when I called her I couldn't believe it when she told me what had happened.

'When she got home she jumped in the shower and I bunged all her clothes in the wash.

'In the summer the smell of animal waste along Weston Road is disgusting.'

Moorside High School headteacher Simon Clarke confirmed three students were sent home to get cleaned up.

Two of the families have complained to John Pointon and Sons, the area's biggest animal rendering plant.

Company officials are now investigating whether the truck was heading to their plant. 

Technical director Barney Williams said: 'We are taking this issue very seriously and carrying out our own investigation.

'We leak-test our vehicles to make sure animal by-products are contained.

'They are all covered and have to be of a Defra-approved standard. I have not had an incident like this in the 10 years I have been with the company.' 

Councillor Gill Heath, cabinet support member for environment and rural issues, said: 'This was a very unpleasant experience for the pupils and should not have happened.

'There are strict controls covering the transportation, disposal and processing of animal by-products, which should always be carried in leak-proof vehicles.

'We are aware of the reports and are investigating.'

The girls were waiting for the bus in Weston Coyney in Stoke when they were showered. It's though 17 trucks-full of animal waste were driven down the road on one day
