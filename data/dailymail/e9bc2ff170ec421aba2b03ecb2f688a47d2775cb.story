Scotland Yard confirmed they attended an address in north-west London where the body of a man was found

A scout leader who was arrested for allegedly downloading images of child abuse has been found dead.

The body of Nick Dewdney was discovered by police at an address in Colindale, North-West London.

The 50-year-old had been suspended by the Scout Association after he was arrested on suspicion of downloading indecent images of children in April.

He was on bail and had not been charged. Police are not treating the death as suspicious.

A spokesman for the Scout Association said: ‘At the time of Mr Dewdney’s death he was suspended from the Scout movement.

‘The Scout Association has co-operated fully with statutory agencies during this case.

'We carry out stringent vetting of all adults who work with young people.

'We require our volunteers to work to a strict code of practice outlined in the Young People First Code of Practice.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police attended an residential address in NW9 following concerns for the safety of the occupant.

'Officers forced entry and the body of a man, aged 50, was found at the scene.

'The death is not being treated as suspicious.'

Dewdney was bailed to return to a west London police station on November 17 pending further inquiries.

The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed of the death, the spokesman said.
