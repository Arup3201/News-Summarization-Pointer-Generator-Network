Apple was hailed for pioneering a 'listening revolution' as it celebrated a decade of iTunes today.

The music store, which started out more than a decade ago with 200,000 songs, reached its 25 billionth download earlier this year.

Since its launch on April 28 2003, iTunes has accrued a catalogue of more than 35 million songs and has around 435 million active account-holders across the world.

Adele's Someone Like You is the most downloaded song in the UK, selling more than 1.46 million copies.

Run, by Leona Lewis, was the first song to top the UK charts on downloads alone.

On average, more than 15,000 songs are
 downloaded every minute and according to the technology website 
Pocket-lint, it would take more than 140,000 years to listen to every 
single music download available through the famous store.

Gennaro Castaldo, of HMV, said the 
music store - along with the iPod - had 'undoubtedly' played a major 
part in changing the way consumers discover and listen to music.

'Between them, they've helped to reshape 
the music landscape.

"In the process creating a commercially viable 
model for digital technology in much the same way the gramophone did for
 recordings some 100 years ago," he said.

"The challenge for Apple now is that 
digital consumers appear to be moving away from owned downloads to 
streaming, and there are now a growing number of competitors all looking
 to challenge their market dominance.

'Demand for physical product also 
remains surprisingly resilient and there's even been a mini-resurgence 
for formats like vinyl as some fans look for a more authentic music 
experience.'

Cameron 
Farrelly, a music specialist at the advertising agency pd3, said: 'Over 
the past 10 years iTunes has drastically changed the way we share, 
purchase and consume music.'

Apple iTunes officially launched on 28 April 2003. This screen grab is how the original software looked ten years ago.

In the ten years since it launched, iTunes has been through various changes. This is the current version, iTunes 11, which launched in November 2012.

The first generation iPod was launched in October 2001. It came in 5GB and 10GB models and had a mechanical scroll wheel.

'It has given us unrestricted and portable access to music's extensive back catalogue and taught the masses the art of a perfect playlist. iTunes have pioneered a listening revolution.'

Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services, said the company took 'great pride' in exposing music fans to new and emerging artists.

He said: 'When Apple introduced the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003, we thought if consumers had a great, legal way to download music they would embrace it - did they ever.

'Apple was floored, as were the labels, when customers bought over one million songs during the first week.

'And now, 10 years later, we continue to be amazed by how much customers love the iTunes Store with more than 25 billion songs sold.'

The iTunes store is now available in 119 countries around the world.

Besides its vast collection of music tracks, it holds more than 190,000 episodes of television programmes and more than 45,000 films.

Geoff Taylor, CEO of the UK's music industry body BPI, said: 'iTunes was the application that persuaded music fans to pay for music in the digital environment.

'Its simplicity and its integration with the iPod, and the ease with which you can manage your music library was critical in giving consumers confidence in digital music.

'I think we can credit iTunes with the resurgence of the singles market, which was in the doldrums in the early 2000s but has now hit a record high.

'Apple deserves a lot of credit for bringing vitality into the digital music market.'

Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience album is the fastest-selling album of all time. It sold 580,000 copies worldwide when it was released in March 2013.

Data from the first Digital Music Index (DMI), published last September by Musicmetric, the London and LA-based trend analysis firm, showed that where retailers like iTunes and legal music streaming services like Spotify were available, piracy was reduced.

Gregory Mead, CEO of Semetric, which owns Musicmetric, said: 'There’s no doubt that iTunes changed the game not just for music, but for retailing films, books and apps.

It caught the crest of a wave just as the music industry sought a solution to file-sharing.

Our data shows that piracy is still a major problem with billions of songs shared each year.

But the good news is that retailers like iTunes and 7Digital along with streaming services like Spotify and Deezer can help reduce piracy.

Streaming is becoming increasing popular but we don’t see it eating into sales.

'What it does do is prove that demand for music continues to grow and having more ways to market your product can only be a positive thing.
