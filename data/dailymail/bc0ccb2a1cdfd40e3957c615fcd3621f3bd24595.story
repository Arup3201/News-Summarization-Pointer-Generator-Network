After England strolled to victory at Celtic Park on Tuesday night, it was fitting that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain should take a leisurely stroll through the countryside on his down day.

Oxlade-Chamberlain got England off to a great start in Glasgow when he nodded in Jack Wilshere’s superb long ball to put the visitors ahead in the 32nd minute.

After the high-octane encounter north of the border, the Arsenal winger was taking it easy with Gunners team-mate Kieran Gibbs and his twin brother Jaydon.

Oxlade-Chamberlain posted a picture of the happy trio titled: ‘Country stroll with the boys @kierangibbs @jaydongibbs & my main man Otis'. 

Oxlade-Chamberlain and Gibbs might as well enjoy their down time now as Arsenal welcome Manchester United to the Emirates on Saturday evening.
