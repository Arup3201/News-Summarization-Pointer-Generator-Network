Spring Break chaos has arrived early in Mexico's Cancun this year with American college students already beginning their revelry across the resort.

Hundreds of students have been pictured starting the party early in the Mexican city today, drinking heavily and dancing the night away with marines on patrol to ensure no one gets too carried away.

This year Cancun was found to be the number one destination for students looking to enjoy the typically wild week-long holiday which doesn't usually get going until March.

However, some college students were out in force last night drinking and partying in the streets until the early hours, knocking back shots in images which they will be hoping don't make it back to mom.

'Spring break is a week of rest and relaxation. You get away from tests, midterms, homework, work, anything,' Sean Wells, a Senior at Indiana State University told wthitv.com.

Students certainly seem a long way from homework if the images which typically emerge from the resort are anything to go by.

Hundreds of young revelers tend to be snapped in shorts and bikinis knocking back cocktails on the beach, in the hotel pools or worse for wear in the bars and on the dance-floor.  

And it doesn't look likely to calm down this year.

In January, student travel agency STA reported the city was the most popular in terms of student travelers followed by Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and Puerta Vallarta also in Mexico.

As student advice website Student 
City says, visitors shouldn't be expecting a quiet time: 'In Cancun, the
party never stops, so you may want to choose your spring 
break hotel based on the noise-level. Chances are that if you don't 
choose a quiet one, you'll just be up for 7 days straight. And that may 
not be a bad thing for some of you.'

However, no matter how many of them there are, it seems the party-goers won't be able to escape the long arm of the law.

Mexican Navy Marines were pictured patrolling the popular nightclubs of the city yesterday starting a season where on average 45,000 people will visit the resort.

The local tourist board is keen to maintain safety in the area, particularly amid fears in Mexico that tourism will decrease as a result of violence in the tourist town of Acapulco.

Six Spanish women holidaying there earlier this month were tied by their bikinis and raped and robbed by a gang of men.

There have been six arrests in connection to the incident.

Jesus
Almagauer, chief executive of the Cancun Convention and Visitors 
Bureau, said Cancun was not a city struggling to keep the peace.

'Last
year Cancun welcomed almost 4 million visitors, and while none of our 
tourists were victims of violent crimes, we understand that safety is 
always a concern when traveling to a foreign country,' he told the LA Times.

'In
response to that concern, and in an effort to dispel any misconceptions
about the destination, we always amplify our security protocol during 
peak travel times to ensure the safety of every person visiting us. 
[Cancun] has better safety records than most major U.S. cities.'  

Last year the Department for Public Safety in Texas sparked a row with Mexican authorities for advising against travel to the resort - for the third year running.

They said violence between rival drug gangs as well as other crime posed safety issues for tourists.

'The Mexican government has made great strides 
battling the cartels, and we commend their continued commitment to 
making Mexico a safer place to live and visit,' Texas Department of 
Public Safety Director Steve McCraw said.

'However, drug cartel violence
and other criminal activity represent a significant safety threat, even
in some resort areas.'

'Many crimes against Americans in Mexico go unpunished,' he added.

Officials in Mexico described the state's stance as 'outrageous'.

Rodolfo Lopez Negrete, chief operating officer of the Mexico Tourism 
Board, said: 'This warning is exceptionally aggressive. To paint Mexico with such a massively broad brush stroke is 
simply outrageous.'

For most students the week off for Spring Break typically comes in March but some colleges offer the week in February.
