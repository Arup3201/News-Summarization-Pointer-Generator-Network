Train drivers in Argentina have been caught on camera reading books, talking on the phone and even falling asleep while behind the controls.

Shocking CCTV footage shows the drivers failing to pay attention as they speed along the tracks and zoom over level crossings.

The video was released by interior minister Florencio Randazzo as part of a campaign to improve rail safety, weeks after three people died in a commuter train crash.

Negligent: Another driver was caught fiddling with his phone as his train raced down the tracks

One train driver can be seen sleeping through repeated road crossings between stations. Another covers up his cabin's camera with a shirt. Still others read books and talk on cellphones at high speeds.

All the drivers featured have been fired or disciplined, according to Mr Randazzo.

Additionally, all staff operating the rail network must now submit to a blood test when they start work each day to ensure they are not excessively tired or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Their licences will expire and have to be renewed annually, and conductors will be required to undertake 100 hours of extra training before sitting rigorous new exams.

The cameras were installed in trains after a deadly crash in Buenos Aires killed three passengers in June.

Last year a train slammed into a crowded station, killing 51 and prompting the government to assume direct control of the rail network.

The revelations from Argentina follow in the wake of a horrific train crash in Spain last week which left 79 people dead.

The driver admitted to a judge yesterday that he had been talking on the phone moments before the accident near Santiago de Compostela.

Argentina's train unions have objected to the installation of CCTV cameras and went on strike for one day over the issue.

They claim that both of the recent crashes in the country were due to faulty brakes, while the government blames mistakes by the trains' conductors.

Union leader Ruben Sorero said, 'I'm not going to defend a motorman who goes asleep,' but accused Mr Randazzo of tarring all workers with the same brush by highlighting cases of abuse.

However, the minister insisted the videos should speak for themselves, adding: 'These measures aren't against anyone, but rather in favor of passengers having a right to have well-trained conductors driving responsibly.'
