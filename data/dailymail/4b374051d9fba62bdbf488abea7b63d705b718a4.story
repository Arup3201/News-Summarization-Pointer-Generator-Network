Split: McDonald's will no longer serve Heinz Ketchup at any of its 34,000 worldwide restaurants

It's been the perfect accompaniment to a Big Mac and fries for decades.

But McDonald's is to stop serving Heinz Ketchup in its 34,000 restaurants worldwide after ending a partnership of more than four decades.

The fast food chain says that the surprising split is down to 'recent management changes'.

Heinz is now led by Bernardo Hees former chief executive of McDonald's arch-rivals Burger King.

McDonald's said that it will work with Heinz until a replacement supplier is in place.

The chain said in a statement: 'As a result of recent management changes at Heinz, we have decided to transition our business to other suppliers over time.

'We have spoken to Heinz and plan to work together to ensure a smooth and orderly transition.'

The switch from Heinz is likely to be more apparent in the UK and other restaurants across the world, with ketchup in most of the franchise's US restaurants supplied from elsewhere.

Heinz disappeared from many US branches in the 1970s after the company couldn't meet McDonald's demands due to a tomato shortage.

Since then, apart from in Pittburgh and Minneapolis where Heinz was still used, most ketchup is just branded as 'fancy ketchup' in US branches.

A Heinz spokesman declined to comment on the matter.

Heinz was bought for $28billion (Â£17.3billion) back in June by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and an investment fund.

It immediately named Hees, still vice chairman of Burger King, as its CEO.

Burker King has been a customer of Heinz for 'decades' and will continue to use its products in around 80 per cent of its outlets around the world, according to a spokesman.

All change: The restaurant chain has been serving up Heinz with its fries in restaurants outside the US for more than 40 years

Silence: Heinz declined to comment on the news that it will no longer count McDonald's among its customers

Henry J Heinz first went into business with L Clarence Noble in 1869 and the first product to be launched was Heinz & Noble's 'pure and superior' grated horseradish.

Seven years later and Mr Heinz set up his second company with two relatives - F&J Heinz Co - and became manager of the firm, launching its now famous ketchup in the US in 1876 and in the UK in 1886.

It wasn't until 1910 that the company's Cream of Tomato Soup made its way to UK stores for the first time and the company began producing its products on British shores for the first time during the 1920s.

Life in plastic is fantastic: Heinz introduced squeezy ketchup bottles for the first time in 1987

In the first year of UK production alone, Heinz created Some 10,000 tonnes of its tomato sauce.

The product's ketchup remained fairly unchanged until 1987, when the company introduced plastic squeezy ketchup bottles as opposed to its traditional glass containers.

Heinz now exports to 60 countries across the world and is the fourth biggest brand name behind Coca Cola, McDonald's and Nescafe.
