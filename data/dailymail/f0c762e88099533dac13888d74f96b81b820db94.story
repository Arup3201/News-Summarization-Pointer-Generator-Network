A huge crackdown on Occupy Boston’s second campsite by hundreds of police officers saw around 100 protesters arrested and their tents and personal belongings reportedly thrown into bins.

They were arrested early this morning around 1:30am after they ignored warnings to move from a downtown greenway near where they have been camped out for more than a week, police said.

The protesters, part of the national Occupy Wall Street movement, had tried to expand from their original site in Dewey Square to a second site across the street, along the Rose Kennedy Greenway.

Police said six protesters were arrested on Tuesday for demonstrating inside a U.S. Senate office building in Washington D.C.

The U.S. Capitol Police said the protesters were charged with unlawful conduct for protesting inside the Hart Senate Office Building, where some senators have offices.

Video footage from television news stations shows the demonstrators attempted to unfurl a banner inside the building that said 'Tax the Rich'. The banner was grabbed by a police officer, and the protesters were arrested.

A local conservancy group recently planted $150,000 worth of shrubs along the greenway and officials said they were concerned about damage.

The arrests were mostly for trespassing.

Police had warned protesters for hours they would have to return to Dewey Square, where a tent city has been steadily growing, and issued leaflets saying protesters could not occupy the greenway.

Around 10 police officers were patrolling the greenway early on Tuesday - some with dogs. Police had at first asked them to leave as the park closes to the public at 11pm.

There had been around 300 protesters on the site as of midnight, reported the Boston Herald, which put the arrest figure at around 100. There were around 200 police officers involved in arrest efforts.

In Seattle, participants in a protest in downtown Westlake Park said on Monday night that they were told the park was closed and they could have been arrested if they remained.

Protesters said they heard from the mayor's office that there were not supposed to be any arrests but from Seattle police on the scene that there might be. No arrests were made.

Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn urged protesters to fight for jobs and justice but insisted the city needs to keep the park open for all and to lessen the impact on nearby businesses.

The protest is now in its second week in Seattle and continues to gather pace.

Protesters who went to a nearby police station to bail people out did not find anyone there, and by 4am they had returned to their encampment to discuss how to raise $4,000 in bail money.

Boston resident Matt Hollander, 25, said a group of veterans carrying American flags were standing in between police and the protesters when officers advanced on them.

He claimed one veteran was pushed over and a group of protesters fell in a heap. ‘If they wanted to arrest us they could have done that without pushing us - without tramping the flag,’ he said.

Protester Shawdeen Vatan, 21, of Arlington, Massachusetts, was not surprised. ‘We're being seen as a legitimate organisation,’ she said. ‘People are panicking and trying to get us out of here.’

There were no arrests in an earlier standoff, where hundreds of students from 10 colleges marched on Monday, briefly confronting police while attempting to hang a banner on a Boston bridge.

The protesters gathered on Boston Common and marched in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse carrying signs that read ‘Apathy isn't working, Raise your voice’.

They chanted slogans like ‘Fund education, not corporations’ and ‘We got sold out. Rich got bailed out’.

They later marched to a Charlestown bridge near the city's North End hoping to hang a banner.

Police blocked the bridge, which was closed for about an hour before the protesters dispersed.

Two demonstrators appeared to scuffle with officers during the standoff. Police reported no arrests.

The protesters on Wall Street and other cities have described themselves at the ‘99 per cent’.

This is referring to what they say are the vast number of Americans struggling to pay their bills while the income gap between the rich and middle class widens.
