With her glowing skin and toned physique, Millie Mackintosh is a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle she preaches. 

And the nutritionist who sparked Millie's interest in all things green and clean says you too can emulate Millie's lifestyle in a few easy steps.

Madeleine Shaw, Millie's best friend and go-to health guru, shared her healthy living tips with FEMAIL and believes that the first port of call is introducing a daily green juice into your diet.

Health guru: Madeleine Shaw is the nutritionist best friend of Millie Mackintosh and believes that by adding one juice into your daily diet, your body will benefit hugely

While many glossy A-listers embark on gruelling three-day juice cleanses, Madeleine, who was one of Millie and Professor Green's bridesmaids, says that having a juice a day alongside your regular diet can have lots of health benefits.

'Juicing for me is a way of life. It's amazing how all of the goodness contained within a freshly made juice can fuel a workout, beat that afternoon slump or to help you sleep,' she said. 

'Freshly made fruit and vegetable juice is packed with nutrients, making it a simple step towards getting your five-a-day.'

She does, however, warn that shop bought juices aren't as beneficial. 

'If you are always on the go then it may seem like an easy option to grab a bottled juice. However, shop bought juices actually lose many of their nutrients over the course of their long shelf life due to the pasteurisation process. Plus they tend to be fruit-based making their sugar content higher,' she said.

Clean living: Madeleine says it's amazing how all of the goodness contained within a freshly made juice can fuel a workout, beat that afternoon slump or to help you sleep and she's shared seven recipes for achieving optimum health

Madeleine, who is working with Philips on its campaign for real juice, starts the week by bagging up all of the ingredients for each juice she plans to make that week in a zip-lock bag with a label on it. 

'When I come to juice I grab the right bag and just put everything through the juicer. I love to have a juice containing beetroot with leaves to cleanse the system before the start of busy week. This has been used for decades to cleanse and support the liver, she said. 

Her 'classic cleanse' juice is packed with carrots, a beetroot, an apple and two stalks of celery.

'Monday morning means it's a fresh new start. I like to sip on a glowing greens juice for breakfast. This is loaded with silica from the cucumber, which helps the elasticity of the skin. It helps you glow even brighter thanks to the vitamin C in the pear, which fights free radicals to help keep your skin fresh all week long.'

Before hitting the gym, Madeleine recommends sipping on a carrot juice with beetroot, parsley and ginger. 'It is a great source of beta-carotene, the famous antioxidant that protects against the damaging effects of stress and increases oxygen in the blood, tissues and brain.

'This juice is the perfect pre workout fuel; I find drinking it so beneficial to my workout, it makes me work harder. Having a big meal can make you feel heavy so something lighter works perfectly, try this recipe before starting some exercise,' she said. 

When the clock hits 4pm, we can often get that mid-afternoon crash and crave sugar but instead of reaching for the biscuit tin, Madeleine recommends whizzing up a juice filled with a handful of spinach, romaine lettuce leaves, cucumber, celery, lemon, apple, ginger and ground cinnamon.

'I always make my 4pm pick-me-up juice and soon feel back to normal without having to reach for an unhealthy snack,' she said.

'This juice has a little dusting of cinnamon which is great for regulating the blood sugar levels reducing that mid-afternoon slump.'

Healthy lifestyle: Madeleine, who follows a clean diet, says that Sunday is her prep day when she gets all of her shopping done at the local farmers market

Having trouble sleeping? Avoid the Night Nurse and make yourself a bedtime juice filled with green apple, strawberries, cherries and a cucumber, says Madeleine. 

'This juice contains cherries, which contain melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep cycle. I drink it an hour before bed then curl up with a book before I hit the hay,' she said. 

She continues: 'Approaching the end of the week I often feel like something a little less green, fruitier and with a kick. So, I grab a quarter of a watermelon and make my watermelon juice. This is a total fat buster. The citrulline in watermelon has been shown to reduce the accumulation of fat in our fat cells. Amazing for getting ready for the weekend ahead! It also tastes so fresh, nothing at all like a store bought juice.' 

She's also created a hangover juice, which she describes as a tamer approach to the Bloody Mary.

'It is loaded with tomatoes, which contain inflammation fighting lycopene and are seriously hydrating for the body if you've had a heavy Friday night!'

Madeleine, who also works with Caggie Dunlop, concludes: 'Juices are great ways of getting a whole host of veggies into your body quickly and tastily. Many people can find it hard to digest a lot of raw veggies but this makes it much easier on the gut. Happy juicing!'
