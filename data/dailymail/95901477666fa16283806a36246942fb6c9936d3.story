A mistress of Dominique Strauss-Kahn received a £900 pair of designer boots and the promise of 'learning new sex games' in return for attending orgies, it is alleged.

The claim is a crucial part of the evidence in the former International Monetary Fund chief's pimping trial which entered its second day in Lille, northern France, today.

Strauss-Kahn, 65, faces up to 10 years in prison if it is proved that he paid women to attend sex parties all over the world.

But the 'girlfriend', identified only as Sylvie, told police that if she became his regular mistress, he would reward her with presents and sex games, rather than cash.

The presents and sex games included Strauss-Kahn taking the 'girlfriend' to the Bois de Boulogne, the wood to the west of Paris, blindfolding her, and 'watching her' having sex with other men.

At the time, Strauss-Kahn was married to the multi-millionaire art heiress and journalist Anne Sinclair, 66, who divorced him last year.

According to the charge sheet in Lille, northern France, Strauss-Kahn was guilty of 'aggravated pimping', which means managing more than one prostitute.

He is specifically accused of 'aiding, abetting or protecting' the prostitution of seven women whom he slept with regularly.

But, in court documents, a number of 'girlfriends' admit they attended orgies organised by Strauss-Kahn, who was once seen being 'entertained' by up to eight women at one time at the Murat Hotel, in Paris.

Four prostitutes identified as Melanie, Mounia, Sabrina and Sandrine are civil plaintiffs in the case.

Some, who are not appearing in court, allege being forced into 'brutal' sex with Strauss-Kahn.

One, called Marie-Anne, said the would-be President of France, said he committed a 'bestial act' during a particularly 'violent' sex session in Washington DC in December 2010.

David Roquet, one of 13 co-defendants in the dock with Strauss-Kahn, is said to have held the woman down while the act took place.

Marie-Anne abandoned a lawsuit for rape, but refused to take part in any more orgies with Strauss-Kahn, according to the court documents.

Defence barristers for Strauss-Kahn complained that allegations emerging in court were a violation of his rights to privacy.

Socialist cabinet minister Segolene Royal, the mother of President Francois Hollande's four children, asked that court proceedings be closed to the media, so children would not hear the sordid details, the court heard.

Strauss-Kahn denies all the charges. He admits attending 'libertine parties', but has insisted that he did not know any of the women involved were prostitutes.

The case continues.

Once tipped to become the next president of France, Dominique Strauss Kahn became the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, in 2007.

But the powerful French lawyer and politician's career was left in tatters after he was accused of raping a chambermaid at a New York hotel in 2011. 

Nafissatou Diallo, 32, alleged that Strauss Kahn had assaulted her when she entered his room. The case later collapsed because of problems surrounding the credibility of the witness and he settled out of court.

He resigned from the IMF on 18 May 2011 but a series of sordid revelations about Strauss Khan's sex life were to follow.

Journalist Tristane Banon came forward during the case claiming that Strauss Kahn had attempted to rape her. He admitted trying to kiss her but in October 2011, prosecutors dropped the case over lack of evidence.

The following year, Strauss Kahn came under investigation over his alleged involvement in a prostitution ring which was linked to hiring prostitutes for sex parties at hotels in Lille, Paris and Washington.

Charges of gang rape in Washington were dropped in October 2012 after the alleged victim told police they were playing consensual 'sex games'.

In July 2013, the shamed former IMF boss was told he would stand trial over allegations of 'aggravated pimping' at the Carlton Hotel in Lille, France in a case which would later become known as the Carlton Affair.

The scandal-struck life of Strauss Kahn was the inspiration for film Welcome to New York - featuring 'Gérard Depardieu as Devereaux, a character modeled on D.S.K.
