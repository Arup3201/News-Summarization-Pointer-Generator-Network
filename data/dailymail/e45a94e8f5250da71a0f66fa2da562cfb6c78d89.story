Beer drinkers will never have to endure sipping on warm lager again thanks to a new gadget that chills drinks from inside the bottle.

The Chillsner, developed by Orlando-based gadget company Corkcicle, looks like an icicle and sits inside the bottle in order to keep beer cold 'until the last sip'.

Designed to fit any standard 9-inch long-neck bottle, the chiller contains a thermal gel which has to be frozen for at least 90 minutes before use.

The Chillsner, developed by Orlando-based gadget company Corkcicle, is made from aluminium and looks like an icicle. It can be put inside drinks bottles to keep the beverages colder for longer. The Chillsner will be available from June and costs around £20. It will come with a freezer pack and two coasters

Festival-goers in South Africa this summer will be able to order beer from their smartphones and have it delivered by a flying drone dropping a can attached to a parachute.

The drone has been developed by Darkwing Aerials and will be tested at the Oppikoppi music festival in the Limpopo province of South Africa this August.

Customers will be able to place their drink orders through an iOS app that will send their GPS coordinates to the drone operators.  

The company claims it will then keep the drink cold 'until the last sip' - although the gadget is said to defrost fully within about 45 minutes. 

Once inserted, the Chillsner stays in the bottle, but does not prevent drinkers from taking a swig.

If pressed firmly, the aluminium device can also create an airtight seal to prevent the beer from becoming flat.

It will be available to purchase from June this year.

Kim Miller, from Corkcicle, said: 'The Chillsner was created because there is nothing worse than drinking warm beer.

The Chillsner contains thermal gel that stays colder for longer and is used to keep drinks cool from the inside. It also has an airtight seal that can be pressed to stop the drink going flat

The Chillsner goes on sale from June this year and will cost around £20 ($29.95)

'Drinking beer is about relaxing and enjoying yourself and when beer gets warm, you are forcing yourself to drink it down, not enjoying it.

'But drinking beer isn't meant to be an unbearable experience.

'The problem is beer is often drunk in hot settings, such as at the beach, at the pool, at a sporting event or at a bbq in your garden.

'If your beer isn't cool enough to contrast with this warm environment it's almost not worth drinking, that's why the solution to this is The Chillsner.'

when it goes on sale last this year, the gadget will cost around £20 ($29.95)

The pack will include two Chillsners, a freezer case and two drinks coasters.
