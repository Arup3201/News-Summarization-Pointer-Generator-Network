We are more accustomed to seeing her lighting up the red carpet in a succession of elegant ensembles or exuding glamour in a Chanel campaign but Keira Knightley maintains she is 'scruffy'.

The 29-year-old actress claims that while she loves to get dressed up 'like a Princess' for red carpet events, she isn't actually that interested in fashion.

Speaking to Australia's Daily Telegraph, she said: 'I’m scruffy, and have always been scruffy. I was never into fashion when I was younger, so fashion is a world I find myself in having never meant to be here.'

Really, Keira? Miss Knightley claims that she feels most at home when she's dressed down and has 'always been scruffy'

And while last year saw her tie the knot with James Righton in a vintage Chanel frock, she claims her favourite piece of clothing is a humble striped cardigan from Gap.

'The reason I wanted it was because it was like the cardigan I had seen Kurt Cobain wearing,' she said of the item that her mother bought her aged 11.

'So, really, my happiest state is baggy and grungy. I like it to be messy. That’s my happy place.'

Happy place? The model says she loves nothing more than wearing dungarees and would wear them every day if she could

Fashion found me: Keira claims she was never into fashion when she was younger, so fashion is a world she finds herself in having 'never meant to be here'

The actress, who has been spotted out and about wearing more low-key looks of late, says she's a huge fan of dungarees because they make her feel younger and says she would wear them every day if she could.

She even revealed that she wore a pair with fairy wings at her 28th birthday party and has 'never been happier'.

Despite her love of casual clothes, Keira has been the face 
of illustrious French fashion house, Chanel, starring as its iconic founder 
Coco Chanel, since 2007.
