Rachel Reeves, a senior member of the Shadow Cabinet, warned Ed Miliband that he needed to do more than just come up with new policies - he needed to explain them too

The Labour Party descended into further turmoil yesterday as Ed Miliband came under attack for his failure to put an 'emotional case' to the voters.

Rachel Reeves, a senior member of the Shadow Cabinet, warned her leader that he needed to do more than just come up with new policies - he needed to explain them too.

Her comments came as one of Mr Miliband's key aides said Labour risked 'losing England' by its failure to listen to the electorate on issues including immigration and Europe.

And backbench MPs lined up to call on him to end the 'sloganeering' and inject more 'passion' into his campaigning, saying the leadership faced 'big questions' over its ability to connect with voters.

The scathing criticism follows Labour's disappointing performance in Thursday's local elections, finishing only slightly ahead of the Conservatives with 31 per cent of the vote – seven points below what Neil Kinnock achieved at the same point before he lost the 1992 election.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the performance was 'not good enough', while insiders said the strategy to concentrate the campaign on Mr Miliband - with other members of the cabinet 'shut out' - had failed disastrously.

Experts warned a party in line to win next year's general election would have expected to do significantly better.

And even before the election, Mr Miliband had a disastrous week, forgetting the name of a key candidate during an interview, having unflattering photos emerge of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich and not knowing how much his family spends on groceries.

Last night Labour strategists were further braced for a disastrous second place in the European elections. Even William Hague managed to top the Euro poll against Tony Blair during his hapless period as Tory leader.

In another blow to Mr Miliband, a survey at the weekend showed a third of voters would be more likely to vote Labour if he was replaced, citing a lack of charisma and 'common touch' as their objections.

Simon Danczuk, one of the party's most outspoken backbenchers, poked fun at Mr Miliband for his difficulties with a bacon sandwich, writing on Twitter that he had launched an 'easier-to-eat' bacon butty at his family's delicatessen in his Rochdale constituency.

Mr Danczuk also said Ukip had stolen a march because it focused on a key voter concern – immigration.

'We've been too much about sloganeering and being on message, and I think a more passionate conversation with the electorate has done Ukip well,' he told Sky News's Murnaghan programme.

Miss Reeves, Labour's work and pensions spokesman, said she agreed Labour had 'more work to do'.

She said: 'We need to understand why people are voting for Ukip and make the emotional case as well as the policy case for why they should be voting Labour.'

Frank Field, welfare minister in Mr Blair's government, said the party had 'the most mega lessons to learn'.

He said the local election results 'pose big questions for the Labour leadership as a whole', and complained the party had been 'silent' on immigration, adding: 'Ukip poses a huge threat to us.'

Lord Glasman, an academic described as Mr Miliband's mentor, also stuck the knife in, saying: 'It pains me to say this; I have come to the conclusion that Labour is in danger of losing England.'

One shadow cabinet member told the Sunday Times of the Labour leader: 'It's not just that people think he is weird. They think he's a joke, and that's even more dangerous.'

Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North, defended Mr Miliband's leadership, but conceded: 'No one is going to confuse Ed Miliband with George Clooney any time soon.'

Last night Alan Johnson, the former Home Secretary, said Mr Miliband and other top politicians do not understand voters' concerns because too many of them have never worked outside politics.

Mr Miliband studied politics at Oxford and then became a special adviser. 'It's not about whether you know the price of a pint of milk or whether you can eat a sandwich properly,' Mr Johnson said. 'But it is about having some understanding of people's lives.'

Despite winning more than 300 extra seats in the local elections, Labour failed to make the sort of advance in some key areas seen as vital to securing an overall majority in the Commons next year.
