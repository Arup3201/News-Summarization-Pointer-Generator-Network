The regime of President Bashar Assad has suffered another serious blow after his younger brother and enforcer Maher Assad lost a leg in a bomb blast which devastated the Syrian security hierarchy last month.

Maher Assad, who is known for his brutality and commands key government units fighting against the Syrian rebels, was injured in the Damascus bombing on July 18 which also claimed the life of his brother-in-law Assef Shawkat and the defence minister Dawoud Rajha.

The news comes as the Assad
regime appears to be teetering on the brink after former foreign minister Farouk al-Sharaa defected to the rebels.

The defection of Mr al-Sharaa is a big loss for the government and comes after former prime minister Riyad Hijab defected earlier this month.

Mr al-Sharaa was one of the regime's most senior figures and had served both President Assad and his father Hafez for more than 20 years.

The Syrian Government has become 
increasingly isolated following its brutal attempts to suppress the 
uprising, including ordering shelling and air strikes on cities such as 
Aleppo and Homs.

It is now reported to control just 30 per cent of the country, with the rebels beginning to gain momentum.

The country has been suspended from the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, while Arab diplomats are believed to have been calling on the regime to cease the bombing.

The United Nations estimates that around 2.5 million refugees are in need of food, shelter and medical supplies within Syria, with thousands trying to reach the relative safety of camps in neighbouring states.

Syrians are pouring across the border to
escape the fighting while disease has broken out in rural areas near 
Damascus, UN aid agencies said today.

More than 170,000 Syrians have been registered in four neighbouring countries (Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey).

Some 3,500 Syrians fleeing the northern areas of Aleppo, Azaz, Idlib and Latakia reached Turkey's Hatay and Kilis provinces between Tuesday and Wednesday, spokesman Adrian Edwards of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said.

'There has been a further sharp rise in the number of Syrians fleeing to Turkey,' Edwards told a news briefing.

A Syrian air strike in the rebel-held border town of Azaz on Wednesday killed 30 people, a local doctor said.
