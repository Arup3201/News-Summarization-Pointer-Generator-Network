Ben Foster was informed by Roy Hodgson last week that he will start against Ecuador on Wednesday and has applauded the man-management style of the England manager.

Hodgson’s inclusive approach is in contrast to the World Cup four years ago when Fabio Capello’s three goalkeepers did not know who would start the opening group game, against the United States, until shortly before the kick-off.

It was Robert Green who got the nod but made an awful mistake which allowed Clint Dempsey to equalise and became the enduring image of a miserable campaign.

Chance to impress: Ben Foster will start for England in their World Cup warm-up game against Ecuador

Established: Foster is the regular back-up to first-choice England goalkeeper Joe Hart

'I knew that last week that I’d be playing this game, so I could tailor my week to get ready for it,' said Foster, the West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, who will start his first England game for nearly four years.

'It’s different for an outfield player because they do all their work separately,' he added. 'For a goalkeeper, it’s important you know you’re playing, not only for how you tailor your training and gym work, but also mentally.

'It’s the same with your clubs, if you know you are playing week in week out, you can tailor everything around.

'Roy is very good with that, very open, a very personable person. He’s more than happy to pull people and have a chat with things and explain things in a very reasonable way.'

Foster was watching on television when Green allowed Dempsey’s low shot to slither through his hands in Rustenburg, South Africa, four years ago.

'I was gutted for him,' said the Albion keeper. 'He’s a fantastic guy, a really nice man. It’s a real shame. I don’t know if it was being sprung at the last minute on him.

'A World Cup is a big deal, with a lot of pressure but he dealt with it and has bounced back, promoted with QPR.'
