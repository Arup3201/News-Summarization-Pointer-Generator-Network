Brink of death: Michael Evans (pictured in hospital), 28, suffered serious brain damage and had his life shattered after he was hit in the head by 21-year-old Daniel Brzozowski

A 28-year-old man was left with half a skull after he was punched by a drunken Polish boxer in an unprovoked late night attack

Michael Evans, 28, suffered serious brain damage after he was hit in the head by Daniel Brzozowski, 21.

Mr Evans, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was knocked out and smashed his head on the pavement after the blow.

He was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, where a CT scan revealed he had suffered a severe traumatic brain injury, bleeding on the brain and a broken jaw.

Brzozowski, of Yarmouth, was sentenced to three years in prison at Norwich Crown Court yesterday after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm.

The Polish immigrant, who has a baby, was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £120.

But Mr Evans' mother Linda Etheridge, 50, has blasted the sentence.

She said last night: 'It's disgusting. He took my son's life.

'Michael's walking round at the moment with half a skull.

'I have to take him where he wants to go. He can't go anywhere by himself.'

She fears her son will never work again after the devastating assault.

'His right hand can't work at the moment but he's practising with the Xbox controller,' said Mrs Etheridge, of Yarmouth.

'He can't use a knife and fork or a pen.

'We've only just been able to get him to go out, up town. He would freak out.

'He was always out with his mates before - he liked pool and nights out.'

She said Michael's memory is now so poor he could not recognise his two-year-old niece when she visited him.

'Michael is a different lad completely. The way he talks is different, his laugh is different,' she added.

'He was convinced he was Batman and could jump off buildings but luckily that's passed,' said Mrs Etheridge.

'As he's got better we've had to explain things to him. When we explained how his injuries had affected him he was apologetic.'

'He remembers places he used to go and places he used to work. He used to work at a hotel in Essex and he remembers it like yesterday. But he couldn't tell you what he did yesterday.'

Mr Evans was out with friends in the town centre when his group was involved in a bust-up with Brzozowski and his friends.

Michael was walking away with his hands in his pockets when he was hit in the head by the amateur boxer.

Brzozowski, who moved here from Poland eight years ago, went home after the vicious attack, calmly got changed and was going out to a nightclub when he was arrested after police tracked him on CCTV.

Mr Evans' stepfather, Andy, 60, said the last seven months since the late-night attack last November have been 'hell'.

He said: 'Nobody could tell us if Michael was going to live or die. It was constant stress.'

Michael is due to have a special titanium plate fitted in his skull on June 27, but his parents are taking events day by day.

'Hopefully there will be a bit more improvement then, but really they can't tell us,' said Mr Etheridge.

'It's all in the lap of the gods.'

'Michael's still struggling to walk, as he has a fused hip, and had learned a special way of coping with it before the attack.'

'He's a 28-year-old 12-year-old at the moment.

'He has no memory of the incident and he has no idea of what this guy looks like or anything.

'It's been hell,' said Mr Etheridge. 'If we weren't so strong it could have easily divided us.'

Mr Etheridge attended yesterday's court hearing and has watched CCTV footage of his son being attacked.

He said of Brzozowski's three-year jail term: 'It's what I expected. 

'He was charged with it being GBH without intent as it was one punch. I don't think it's right, but I suppose that's the law.'

Chris Youell, prosecuting, said Mr Evans nearly died from the unprovoked attack, had to have an emergency operation and spent three months in hospital.

Recorder Mark Dennis told the thug as he jailed him: 'It was yobbish, violent behaviour, late at night, when in drink.

'It was a life-changing event for the victim, who will never be the same person again.

'You know how to punch and how to hurt someone, and you know the consequences of a heavy punch.'

Mr Burrows said after the case: 'This is a very sensitive case with devastating effects all round.

'No-one ever minimises the level of injury or wider impact it has on the victim's family members.

'This single punch in drink will haunt Daniel for many years, if not the rest of his life.'

Ross Burrows, defending, said Brzozowski 'misjudged the situation and felt threatened'.

'He threw the punch because he was trying to protect his group. His intention was to punch and run.

'It will stay with him for the rest of his life. He has not been out since and does not drink. It was a moment of madness.'

Inspector Nick Cheshire, of Norfolk Police, said last night: 'This was an unprovoked attack which left an innocent man with serious head injuries, having been enjoying a night out with friends in Yarmouth.

'Brzozowski was arrested a short time later and was still drunk whilst in custody.

'The majority of people drink responsibly. But the minority who do drink to excess and behave violently or anti-socially cause a disproportionate amount of trouble and distress to the local community.'
