Samsung Galaxy S II has remained the most popular handset in Britain for an eighth consecutive month - beating iPhone 4S into second place

Demand for Apple's new hi-tech iPhone 4S has been huge - with many retailers reporting shortages.

Some users have waited weeks to receive their new handets.

But whether it's supply shortages or not, the new Apple handset has failed to unseat the reigning champion of the smartphone market.

Samsung's Galaxy S II is still the best-selling smartphone in the UK, according to independent price comparison and switching service, uSwitch.com. 

The Samsung Galaxy S II, this year’s best selling phone, has now 
maintained the top spot on the mobile charts for an eighth consecutive 
month.

Nokia's Lumia - a Windows Mobile handset released to a huge wave of hype - failed to make a huge dent in the market, entering the charts in sixth place.

The phone, which is free on contracts from just over £25, launched a month after the iPhone 4S - so it remains to be seen how it will fare long term.

Samsung also dominates the November chart as a manufacturer, occupying third position with the Galaxy Ace, whilst the launch of the near tablet-sized Galaxy Note and high-end Galaxy Nexus smartphone saw them enter at seventh and eighth place respectively. H

HTC's 'reinvention' with 'Beats by Dre' - described as the 'Prada of headphones' by Grazia magazine, and allowing the Taiwanese manufacturer a new, music-focused direction, meant that the Sensation XE entered the charts at Number 9.  The Samsung Galaxy Ace, iPhone 4 and HTC Wildfire S all fell one place as they were pushed down by the strong rise of the iPhone 4S.
