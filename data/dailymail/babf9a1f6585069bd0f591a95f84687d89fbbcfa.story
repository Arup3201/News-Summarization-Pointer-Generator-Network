Major supermarket chains in outback Australia have removed a popular brand of deodorant from the shelves after three children were hospitalised from sniffing the contents in April alone.

According to a sign inside a Woolworths store in Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, Rexona aerosol cans had been removed due to a 'continuing social issue' in the area.

'Rexona, until further notice, will not be displayed,' the sign reads.

Removed from the shelves: Major supermarket chains have cleared the shelves of Rexona deodorants after a 'continuing social issue' involving teenagers sniffing the contents of the cans to get high

'You can purchase Rexona from the service counter. We apologise for any inconvenience.'

Coles supermarkets have also cleared their shelves in an attempt to combat the social issue.

It is understood teenagers are stealing the cans and inhaling the contents in an attempt to get high.

A Woolworths spokesman confirmed the Rexona deodorants had been removed.

'Woolworths has removed from its' shelves in our Alice Springs store a particular kind of deodorant at the request of local authorities,' he told the MailOnline.

'Signs on our shelves advise customers that they can still purchase the product from our store by asking for it at the service counter.'

Woolworths stores in Alice Springs have removed Rexona cans from their shelves after reports of teenagers stealing them and inhaling the contents. Three children were hospitalised as a result last month

Central Australian Youth Link-Up Service policy and project manager Tristan Ray said there had been a very worrying number of inhalant cases by minors recently.

'We saw a big spike in deodorant-can sniffing in town with almost 500 cases being reported over the past couple of weeks,' Mr Ray told the NT News.

This is the second deodorant-sniffing outbreak in the past 12 months, the newspaper reported.

Mr Ray said it wasn't just big supermarket chains participating in the preventative measure by his organisation and the NT Police force.

'We have been working with a number of stores across town, not just the major supermarkets, to remove the products from the shelves and place them behind the counter for a couple of weeks. They are mainly being stolen ... so this makes it harder for people to get,' he said.

'We try to target the substances that are mainly being used and we are monitoring the situation by regularly visiting problem areas, working with youth services and following up reports from rangers.'

Mr Ray confirmed the same outbreak occurred at exactly the same time last year following the Lightning Cup Carnival.

But he said the Youth Street Outreach Service was helping to control the situation 12 months ago, an organisation that has since disbanded due to lack of funding.
