On the run: Jordan Caldwell, of County Antrim, Northern Ireland, is now recovering and has grown two inches in three months

A 17-year-old boy has finally hit puberty after a four-year fight with anorexia stunted his growth.

Jordan Caldwell, of County Antrim, Northern Ireland, developed an eating disorder aged 12, when he was dropped from his local football team - and believed he was ‘too fat’ to play.

Desperate to become fitter, he started compulsively exercising and throwing away his lunch, shrinking to just 5st 3lbs. At his worst, he stopped eating and drinking completely.

Jordan is now recovering and has grown 2in in three months. But the 5ft 5in teenager said his eating and weight problems began in May 2009 when he was dropped from his football team.

Combined with the death of a family friend and the pressures of school exams, this triggered negative thoughts about his body. At home in the evenings, while his mother Siobhan, 44, father Leslie, 46, and sister Jessica, 12, sat watching television, Jordan would work out in his room, performing up to 500 crunches and push-ups.

Concerned about his shrinking figure, his parents took him to his GP where he was told he was borderline underweight and needed to be monitored. Within a month he had dropped another 5lbs and was taken back to the doctors, who referred him with a suspected eating disorder to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) for help.

Jordan was hospitalised in May 2010 weighing just 5st 8lbs and was not allowed to walk around. He had to use a wheelchair to stop him from exerting his body.

His mother Mrs Caldwell, a teaching assistant, said: ‘We were helpless to make him eat - he wouldn’t listen to any of us. It was heart-breaking to witness him slowly starving himself.’

At first, Jordan refused to eat and would spit his food into rolls of tissue paper while pretending to sneeze or blow his nose.

But, after six weeks of treatment and bed rest he eventually relented and managed small portions. He was finally discharged, but back at home he struggled to eat and continued to exercise.

He said: ‘As soon as I got home I went back to my old habits. I was desperate to lose the weight again. I had weigh-ins twice a week and my weight would fluctuate. I was torn between getting better and not wanting to gain weight.’

Mrs Caldwell was forced to physically restrain him from exercising. She said: ‘From 7am to 11pm Jordan had to be watched.

'He was too sick to attend school so I
 had to take time off work to monitor him. He wouldn’t sit down at all 
during the day - the only time he would rest his frail body was at night
 when he slept.’

Despite the
 pain and the constant feeling of exhaustion, Jordan could not break 
free from his obsession and he continued to restrict his body of food 
and drink.

His anorexia sparked an all-consuming obsessive–compulsive disorder, leading him to exercise more than four hours a day.

Mrs
 Caldwell would chase him around the garden, pleading with him to stop, 
but he refused, terrified that his body would stop burning calories.

At
 his worst, Jordan stopped drinking for days, refusing to brush his 
teeth in fear that just a drop of water would see him gain weight. His 
lips were badly cracked from the dehydration.

But
 in July 2010, Jordan was admitted for treatment at Beechcroft 
children’s psychiatric unit in Belfast. He weighed 5st 3lbs and was told
 he would have to be tube fed if he didn’t begin to eat.

He said: ‘I remember waking up to a 
nurse putting Vaseline on my cracked lips. I became so angry and 
aggressive that it might somehow make me put on weight. By this point I 
just wanted to die.’

Puberty sees children mature sexually and their reproductive organs become functional. 

It starts for most boys at 12, while girls start developing from 11 on average, and it is caused by a release of sex hormones.

Puberty causes rapid growth spurts, as well as the development of breasts in girls and an increase in boys' penis size.

There also psychological changes that can see teenagers become self-conscious, aggressive and moody - and behavioural differences that lead teenagers to experiment with potentially dangerous activities such as smoking or sex.

Early or delayed puberty in children - such as Jordan - can be caused by an underlying condition, such as a long-term illness.

On his 13th birthday, Jordan collapsed and suffered a seizure and was 
rushed to an accident and emergency department where he was given fluids
 to raise his blood pressure and blood sugar levels.

After 10 months of intensive treatment
 and therapy, Jordan was allowed back home, but his body was so damaged 
by the anorexia that his growth had been stunted - and doctors warned he may
 never go through puberty.

Jordan
 gradually started to eat with his family at mealtimes, but it took him 
more than two hours to finish a meal. He continued to receive treatment 
and counselling, but life was still a struggle.

Two years later in June 2013, Jordan bumped into family friend and personal trainer Ben Mudge, who suffers from cystic fibrosis.

The
 teenager was impressed by Mr Mudge’s muscly physique and - after 
talking to him about health and fitness - Jordan decided he wanted to 
have a man’s body, and found the motivation to get better.

Jordan said: ‘When I saw Ben I was in awe.
 He was a really fit, healthy guy and he has taught me a healthy 
approach to food and exercise.’

The pair became friends and Jordan’s body gradually started to recover and he was determined never to go back to hospital again.

He now consumes 3,500 calories, eating between six and eight nutritional meals a day.

He said: ‘I became more positive and began to eat, increasing my calorie intake. Ben got me off my “safe foods” and I now eat peanut butter, as well as lots of protein.

‘To me, Ben is my superhero and helped saved me from anorexia. When I look at pictures of me when I was ill and me today there is such a difference. I don’t recognise the old me and never want to return to that.

Jordan, who now weighs a healthy 8st 8lbs, trains with Mr Mudge every six weeks.

He said: ‘I’m so thankful to be given a second chance and I want to inspire others and show them they can beat it.’

Mr Mudge, 24, said: ‘When I first met Jordan he was still in the grips of anorexia. He was very malnourished and still battling his demons.

‘He used to tell me he wanted to look like me, but I told him he needs to be himself.  Since he started working with me there has been such a change. I wanted to help him hit puberty and now he’s becoming a strong minded man.

‘Less than a year ago he weighed 6st 8lbs and now he is 8st 8lbs. I’m really proud of what he’s achieved - he’s a strong lad and I hope he continues on the road to recovery.’

Mrs Caldwell said: ‘I am so thankful to everyone who has helped Jordan with his recovery.

'He is still here today because of his family, medical and counselling care he received at Beechcroft and the continued care with the eating disorder team at CAMHS unit.’
