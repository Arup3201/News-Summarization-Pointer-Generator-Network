Workers have been accused of wasting money after choosing to widen a footpath rather than cut back an overgrown hedge so people could get past.

The path, which links a main road to pensioner bungalows in Bradford, West Yorkshire, had become blocked due to a hedge running alongside it becoming overgrown.

But it is claimed that workmen decided to widen the path so more people had space to pass the rampant overgrown hedge, rather than just prune back its leaves and branches.

Leslie Howard, who lives nearby and uses the path often said he was shocked to see workers lay down the tarmac instead of cutting the hedge.

The 74-year-old said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw that instead of cutting the bush back they'd put more tarmac down.

'It's a complete waste of money. I reckon I could have cut the hedge back in half an hour.

'How long does it take to dig out the grass, put hard core down and lay a path?'

Mr Howard also added that the new tarmac extension did not even solve the problem because workmen had only dealt with part of the path.

He explained: 'They should come back and cut the hedge back all the way up the path or remove it.'

Mr Howard keeps fit by walking to nearby Eastburn, using the path, which runs up a hill towards four bungalows for the elderly.

Several years ago Bradford Council replaced the steps on the incline with a ramp to provide wheelchair access to the bungalows.

He said he had first reported the overgrown hedge a few years ago and that time workmen had cut it back. 

However, a spokesman for the council said they weren't responsible for the new path, adding it was nothing to do with them 

He added: 'The path was very wide, but this bush started growing and growing until it went over most of the path.

'You have to walk on the grass verge to get round. I'm fairly fit but I have to step on the grass.

'I've seen kids on their bikes come straight down from the path to the grass then back to the path, which is dangerous if they slip.'

A council spokesman said the incident was nothing to do with the council.
