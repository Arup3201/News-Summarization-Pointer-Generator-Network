Birmingham City Council has questions to answer about claims it ignored warnings about a Trojan Horse takeover of schools by Islamic extremists, Michael Gove said today.

The Education Secretary said that it was essential that extremists were denied a platform in schools and other public institutions to push their agenda.

A major report by former top counter-terror police officer Peter Clarke is expected to criticise officials in Birmingham and Whitehall for failing to act on concerns about teaching in some schools.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said the council in Birmingham and his own department in Whitehall had questions to answer over the way they responded to concerns about schools in the city

The investigation came after allegations of a takeover plot in Birmingham schools by hardline Muslims.

Head teachers told Ofsted there was an organised campaign to impose a ‘narrow, faith-based ideology’ at some schools in the city.

It placed five of the city’s schools in special measures after ‘deeply worrying’ findings.

Mr Clarke was brought in to carry out a review of the way complaints were handled an acted upon during more than a decade.

The inquiry has identified up to 25 state schools, some directly run by the council, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

Mr Gove told BBC One’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘There are broader questions about the extent to which these activities were coordinated and the extent to which those responsible for these activities may have had a broader agenda.

‘Peter is looking into that and we have to wait to see what he concludes...

‘There are questions for the local authority and of course for my department, the Department for Education about what was known and what was done.’

He defended his decision to appoint Mr Clarke, the former Scotland Yard head of counter-terrorism, to lead the investigation.

‘There was some criticism, right at the beginning of this process, when I appointed Peter. People felt that it was in some respects, too dramatic and authoritarian a step.

'But the view that I took was if you have a police officer of unimpeachable integrity to conduct these investigations, if people are at the end of this process cleared, given a clean bill of health, then that is the most effective way of ensuring that public confidence can be restored.’

Mr Clarke’s report is expected to be published later this summer.

The government has announced that schools will be shut down if they fail to promote British values.

Mr Gove called for a 'robust' defence of liberal values in the face of the challenge from Islamist extremists.

'Islamism is a perversion of Islam in the same way that communism was a perversion of socialism and fascism is a perversion of nationalism,' he said.

The inquiry is said to have identified up to 25 state schools in Birmingham, some directly run by the council, where concerns ere raised about the influence of extremists

'If liberalism is to survive - and I believe liberalism is the way in which we approach these issues, liberal values are our best protector - we need to be robust.

'We need to challenge those views and we need to make sure that people who have views that are inimical to liberal values and wish to use institutions to push an agenda which is inimical to liberal values are not in a position where they can use public money or the public square in order to push their views.'

Mr Gove - who has previously clashed publicly with Home Secretary Theresa May over the Government's handling of the issue - went out of his way to praise her.

'No Home Secretary has been as vigilant in dealing with the terror threat as Theresa May,' he said. 'I think she has done a very good job in this area.'
