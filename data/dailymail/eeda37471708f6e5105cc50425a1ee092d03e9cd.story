The scorching temperatures are set to carry on climbing this weekend before thunderstorms cool us off, forecasters warn.

The mercury could reach 30C (86F) in some parts on Saturday before the heavy showers arrive.

However, don’t pack away the bikinis and barbecues just yet – the downpours will be short-lived before much of the country can get back to revelling in a second weekend of glorious sunshine.

Three-day forecast: We can expect plenty of sunshine in the next few days with highs of 29C, which is warmer than Rio where the mercury is only expected to top 27C

By Monday, temperatures will return to
nearer normal for the time of year, though there will be long dry 
periods for much of the country. Next week the South will continue to 
enjoy plenty of fair weather, while it will be more unsettled in the 
North.

The hottest day of the year was on 
Monday in Edenfel, County Tyrone, where the mercury hit 29.9C (85.8F). 
But Met Office experts predict the record could be broken on Saturday, 
with temperatures expected to peak past 30C (86F) for the first time 
this year.

The monthly outlook remains mostly positive for the south of England, with dry and sunny conditions predicted until August.

Forecaster Tony Gray of the Met Office
said: ‘It will be mostly dry and fine with plenty of sunshine around 
into the weekend. Central areas will enjoy the warmest weather, with 
temperatures reaching the high 20s, while northern and coastal areas 
will be cooler.

‘There is a risk of thunderstorms on 
Saturday in the afternoon and evening, mostly likely in parts of the 
north and east, caused by the warm weather.

‘Thunderstorms can be triggered by the intense heat and humidity rising into the upper atmosphere.’

The warm start to this month is a 
welcome change after the coldest spring in more than five decades, while
last year was the second wettest on record.

Hosed
down: The Barton Bridge near Trafford Park, Greater Manchester, was 
stuck open yesterday after heat caused the metal frame to expand whilst 
it was opened

Not closing: The metal on Barton Bridge, near Trafford Park, swelled up in the afternoon sun and by rush hour its two halves would not fit together

bridge where it meets the road (left) and expanded. Later, they cleared

Yesterday, parts of Britain were similar in temperature to Spain, Portugal and the South of France, and hotter than Rio.

The sunny weather has resulted in a 
sudden rise in sales of paddling pools and water pistols as the nation 
tries to keep cool. Sainsbury’s reported selling tens of thousands last 
weekend, while on Saturday alone they shifted a record 85,000 bags of 
ice.

Ice cream sales were also up 130 per 
cent. And as families grabbed the first chance to enjoy al fresco 
eating, 1.85million packs of burgers flew off the shelves – with 250 
bags of salad bought every minute.

Yesterday, the temperatures  soared so much that even the roads started to melt.

Streets in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, 
were badly affected as the sun caused tar to liquefy, and authorities 
were forced to put sand on damaged surfaces.

We
can expect plenty of sunshine in the next few days with highs of 29C, 
which is warmer than Rio where the mercury is only expected to top 27C.

The hot weather here is also on par 
with Spain, Portugal and France. Met Office forecaster Sarah Holland 
said: ‘There should be plenty of sunshine around in the next few days 
for most areas, with highs of up to 27C in the north and 29C in the 
south.

‘On Friday we could see a bit of 
cloud around and in the north and north west there could be a few spots 
of drizzle but apart from that it looks like another fine week.'

Meanwhile, a busy commuter route in Greater Manchester was closed on Monday after a bridge expanded in the summer heat and jammed open.

The metal on Barton Bridge, near Trafford Park, swelled up in the afternoon sun and by rush hour its two halves wouldn’t fit together. Firefighters were called and hosed down the bridge with cold water for more than an hour before it had cooled enough to close.
