Held: Neville Thurlbeck, pictured arriving at the Leveson Inquiry in December, was arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation yesterday

Former News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck today bemoaned the 'swift' action of detectives investigating phone-hacking after he was arrested on suspicion of intimidating a witness.

Thurlbeck, 50, was held after criticising executive Will Lewis, who is on News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee, in a blog post.

In one entry, the journalist named the security firm protecting Mr Lewis' home and the North London street where he lives.

The road name - which can be found on the publicly available electoral roll - was subsequently removed from the post.

Lawyers for Mr Lewis threatened an injunction, accusing 
Thurlbeck of carrying out surveillance on his home, invading his privacy
and publishing libels about him.

His
lawyers also claimed the reporter had libelled News Corporation's 
Management and Standards Committee, formed to clean up the company – 
which published the now defunct Sunday tabloid – following the hacking 
revelations.

As a key member of the MSC, Mr Lewis has become a central figure in a civil war in Rupert Murdoch's empire.

The committee's co-operation with 
Scotland Yard has caused fury among journalists after internal emails 
and details of suspected illegal activity were handed to detectives, 
which resulted in the arrests of several reporters and senior executives
from The Sun.

Thurlbeck was one of the first suspects questioned by detectives from the Yard's hacking probe, Operation Weeting, last April.

Yesterday he was arrested by police on suspicion of witness intimidation after turning up for a pre-arranged appointment at a central London police station.

Writing after he was bailed, Thurlbeck said the events 'really didn't feel like England'. He also denied any wrong-doing.

He wrote: 'Clearly, my blog has upset someone.

'So much so, one minute I was sitting 
penning a new post. The next, I was in the police station, having DNA 
mouth swabs and my fingerprints and police mugshot taken.

'A complaint had been made and acted upon very swiftly indeed.

'It really didn't feel like England today.'

After thanking his lawyer, family and 
friends, he went on: 'I vigorously deny the allegations of any 
wrongdoing, which seem extremely far-fetched to me.

'And I will continue with my blog and my work regardless of today's events.

'I will be issuing no further statement on this matter in the immediate future.'

He also stressed Scotland Yard 'got my
age wrong again' in a statement to the press, adding: 'I am a mere 50 years old and not the 
prehistoric 51 they insist I am!'

Mr Thurlbeck was arrested the day after former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks, her 
husband Charlie, and four other suspects were arrested over allegations 
of cover-ups surrounding the phone-hacking inquiry.

Scotland Yard said Mr Thurlbeck was bailed after being questioned on suspicion of witness intimidation and encouraging or assisting an offence.

A spokesman said yesterday that a '51-year-old man' had been detained.

He said: 'A 51-year-old man was arrested by appointment at a central London police station at approximately 4pm today by officers from Operation Weeting, the MPS inquiry into the phone hacking of voicemails.

'He was arrested on suspicion of intimidation of a witness (contrary to Section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994) and encouraging or assisting an offence (contrary to Section 46 of the Serious Crime Act 2007).'

The spokesman added: 'He is bailed to return to a south-west London police station in May this year in relation to the arrest in April.'

Thurlbeck has said detectives asked him to become a prosecution witness after seizing documents from his home.

Evidence taken from his property after his first arrest last April indicated that he warned senior colleagues two years ago about hacking, he said.

Thurlbeck said detectives hoped he would become a key witness in return for potential immunity from prosecution.

But he said he had turned down the offer.

He said in November: 'I have informed Scotland Yard that while I fully understand and respect the reason for their request of me to give evidence for the Crown in any prosecution arising from Operation Weeting, it is my opinion that a detailed and forensic inquiry into my working methods by what is a highly professional police unit will fully exonerate me.

'So, on that basis, I have declined their offer.'

Thurlbeck has also previously lodged a claim for unfair dismissal against News International.
