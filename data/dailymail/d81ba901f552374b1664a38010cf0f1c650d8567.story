Free to study: Rudy Guede is being allowed out of prison after serving just six years of sentence for the murder of Meredith Kercher

The drifter convicted for the killing of Meredith Kercher has insisted Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito are guilty of her murder, as it was revealed he is being allowed to leave prison to study for a degree.

Rudey Guede, 27, who is serving a 16 year jail sentence for the murder and sexual assault of Meredith, spoke out as it emerged he is now eligible for day release after serving just six years of his sentence.

Because of the Italian legal system Guede is entitled to early release as he has served almost half his sentence - and has been a model prisoner with no incidents of misbehaviour during his time in prison, the Daily Mirror reports.

In a letter to his lawyer Walter Biscotti, he said: ‘I want to underline that the people who committed this terrible crime are still free and that the truth has still not emerged and that it will never be found, especially if people continue to listen to false testimony and liars.‘All I have heard is lies and a distortion of the facts especially when it comes to my character. The judiciary must seek to establish the truth because that night I did not kill anyone and the people responsible for what happened that tragic night are still free.‘The court still insists that I was guilty of sexual assault but I did not commit that crime and even the autopsy proves that. This is a painful episode for me and for Meredith’s family. I am seen as the ideal guilty person but  I had nothing to do with this.’

Guede was initially convicted under a fast track trial in 2008 and sentenced to 30 years in jail for Meredith’s murder and sexual assault but this was later reduced to 16 years on appeal.

During his trial he admitted being at
 the murder scene but he insisted he had been in the toilet at the time 
Meredith was attacked, and that he emerged to see ‘someone resembling 
Sollecito’ fleeing the scene and ‘Knox outside the house’ where the 
murder took place in Perugia in November 2007.

British student Meredith Kercher was found with her throat cut in her bedroom in the central Italian city of Perugia. Rudy Guede was found guilty of murder and sexual assault

DNA tests established Guede was at the scene after his fingerprints were found in Meredith’s blood and he was also identified from a faeces specimen found in a toilet at the house.

He told the court that convicted him that he had found Meredith bleeding to death and then tried to save her by stemming a wound to her neck but then  fled as he relaised she was dying.

Last night Guede’s lawyer Valter 
Biscotti confirmed that Guede was now eligible for parole and had been 
given permission to study at an undisclosed university near Perugia but 
he had not yet left prison to take up his place on the course.

He said: ‘Rudy can go out of prison for 
several hours at a time now and that’s the law all over Italy. He spends
 his days studying history.

Raffaele Sollecito has been ordered to serve 25 years and Amanda Knox 28  years  after a judge upheld their original guilty verdicts for the murder of Meredith Kercher

'He spends some hours with a teacher, we don’t want to say where he is because he will get swamped by people from all over the world.

‘At the moment he’s not going out. But he can if he wants to, he just has to make an application.

Last month an appeal court in Florence upheld the original murder convictions on Knox and Sollecito and a judge ordered that she serve 28 years while he was given 25 years - although neither sentence has been enforced as a further appeal stage has to be concluded.

Both Knox and Sollecito have insisted they are innocent and have blamed Guede for the murder with Sollecito saying: ‘There is no evidence of me or Amanda at the scene while Guede’s DNA is everywhere.’
