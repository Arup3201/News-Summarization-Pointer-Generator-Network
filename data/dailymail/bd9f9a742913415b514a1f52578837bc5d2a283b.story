America is in the grip of a pornography pandemic that has become so serious it should be treated the same way as teenage smoking or drink driving, activists have warned.

Dawn Hawkins, executive director of Morality in Media, which has campaigned against pornography since 1962, said porn must be tackled no differently than any major public health crisis.

Speaking ahead of a two-day conference on sexual exploitation, she said, if left untreated, addiction to pornography can leave users with psychological damage.

'There’s a lot of science now proving that pornography is harmful,' Hawkins said at the National Press Club in Washington. 'We know now that almost every family in America has been touched by the harm of pornography.'

The Coalition to End Sexual Exploitation summit - beginning today - aims to look at pornography as a complex social problem that needs to be framed as a public health issue.

Empowering? Miriam Weeks - a 19-year-old women's studies student at elite Duke University caused a national stir recently when she came out as moonlighting Internet porn star Belle Knox

Participants include health professionals, social workers, academics, feminists, faith leaders, campaigners against human trafficking and former members of the multibillion-dollar adult entertainment industry.

'This is a business with considerable political clout,' said Gail Dines, a sociology and women’s studies professor at Wheelock College in Boston and author of 'Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality.'

Porn sites get more visitors per month than Netflix, Amazon and Twitter combined, a third of all downloads contain porn and the Internet now hosts 4.2 million porn websites, said Dines, who is also president of the international feminist group Stop Porn Culture.

'Porn is without doubt the most 
powerful form of sex education today, with studies showing that the 
average age of first viewing porn is between 11 and 14 — and let me tell
 you, this is not your father’s Playboy,' she said.

'These
 degrading misogynist images have become the wallpaper of our lives and 
they are robbing young people of an authentic healthy sexuality that is a
 basic right of every human being.'

Donny Pauling, a former adult film 
producer for Playboy and others who also ran a network of adult websites
 before quitting the business in 2006, said he has personally seen the 
ill effects of the porn business on the women who appear in front of the
 camera.

He doubted that Miriam Weeks — a 
19-year-old women’s studies student at elite Duke University who caused a
 national stir recently when she came out as moonlighting Internet porn 
star Belle Knox — feels as 'empowered' as she has claimed.

'I
 don’t buy her story,' Pauling said. 'I recruited more than 500 
first-timers into the business and there’s never been one that came back
 and thanked me.'

Mary Anne Layden of the University of Pennsylvania, who specializes in sexual trauma, said pornography has been a factor in every case of sexual violence that she has treated as a psychotherapist.

'The earlier males are exposed to pornography, the more likely they are to engage in non-consensual sex — and for females, the more pornography they use, the more likely they are to be victims of non-consensual sex,' she said.

In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this month, Weeks revealed that she started watching pornography at the age of 12 — and that she was once raped at a high school house party.

'There is going to have to be programs out there that get kids to understand how porn is manipulating them,' Dines said.

And Layden suggested that if the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention got 'interested in this as a public health issue, we can have success in the way that we had success with the issue of cigarette smoking.'
