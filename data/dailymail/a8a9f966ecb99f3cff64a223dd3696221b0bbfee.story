A couple wrote a letter poking fun at burglars who broke into their home and apologised for not having 'more for you to take’.

In a note pinned to their boarded-up door, Kate Barrett, 36, and Dan Owens, 34, also thanked the thieves for leaving their fingerprints.

Their Northampton home was broken into on Sunday evening while they were out.

After having their home burgled, this couple wrote a note apologising for not having 'more for you to take'

Raided: Thieves got away with some cash, a camera, an iPod and two gold watches after breaking in

The thieves, who climbed over their garden wall and smashed through their patio door, got away with some cash, a camera, an iPod and two gold watches.

Mr Owens, who runs a PR business, said they decided to put up the passive-aggressive note rather than ‘sit around and mope’.

The letter apologises for not ‘having particularly expensive tastes’ and says Mr Owens was disappointed they chose to ignore Ms Barrett’s ‘awful’ VHS video and cassette collection.

Since uploading a picture of it on to Twitter and Facebook, the note has gone viral, shared and retweeted hundreds of times.

‘I’d gone to my parents for the weekend while Kate went to London to watch the Strictly Come Dancing live show,’ said Mr Owens.

This is the letter the couple from Northamptonshire wrote to the thieves who targeted their home

‘She called and I came straight over and the place had been ransacked.

‘I think they were planning to go out through front door with the telly, but luckily the spare key doesn’t work.

‘We were able to pinpoint the time they left as we were recording the X-Factor results show - which had cut out 42 minutes in.

‘So they tried to nick the TV at 8.42pm - hopefully that will narrow it down for any witnesses.

‘Kate’s a big hoarder and has all these awful old tapes and videos from way back when and they are welcome to those.

‘We don’t have much need for old Sweet Valley High VHS tapes or Take That and 911 cassettes.’

Ms Barrett, a communications officer, added: ‘So many people just sit and round and mope after being burgled - I thought it would be a good idea to leave them a note in case they come back or see it on Twitter.

‘It was just our way of dealing with the situation .

‘When I posted it on social networking sites - I never expected the reaction I got.

‘People seem to think it is brilliant and have said it’s admirable how we’ve coped with the burglary while keeping a smile on our faces.

‘They left their fingerprints all over everything so hopefully the police will find who did it soon.’

Northamptonshire Police said officers are investigating the burglary and appealed for witnesses to come forward.
