Wilfried Zaha is once again playing with a smile after what has been a frustrating few years for the Crystal Palace loanee.

Two years ago the winger's outstanding displays in south London led Manchester United to come calling, paying a fee which could reach up to £15million.

Zaha remained with the Eagles for the remainder of 2012/13 campaign, playing an integral role in their promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs.

Things then began to go awry, though. Sir Alex Ferguson's last ever signing barely got a look-in under successor David Moyes, leading the 22-year-old to end the season on loan at Cardiff.

Zaha again departed Old Trafford temporarily in the summer, returning to his south London roots to rejoin Palace on a season-long loan.

It offered him a chance to relaunch his career and, after an inconsistent start, he is beginning to regularly show glimpses of the skill which led to the chant 'He's just too good for you.'

'Obviously there was a period where I thought "What's going on here?''' Zaha said. 'As a footballer it is important not to think that way and remain professional.

'I knew that if I got the chance I needed to take it and not dwell on the past and I am not one to dwell on the past and it was up to me to take it.

'I have a smile on my face because I am back on the pitch. I enjoy playing football, so when I am on the pitch I am happy.

'It is about having trust in me. This gaffer has put trust in me and I am trying to give it back and performing for the team.'

Zaha is enjoying life under new manager Alan Pardew, who on Saturday oversaw his fourth straight win since replacing Neil Warnock.

The England international was impressive in the latest victory, causing havoc as Palace progressed to the FA Cup fifth-round with a 3-2 win at Southampton.

'I said to myself that if I got minutes on the pitch, then I would get better and better,' Zaha said.

'To find a manager that has got trust in me and get me on the pitch. I am going to lose the ball. I will do tricks and lose the ball, but if I get the chance I will either try to score or set up a chance.'

Zaha's improvement bodes well for both Palace and parent club Manchester United.

The winger looks unlikely to taste relegation for the second successive season given the Eagles' recent improvements, while United manager Louis van Gaal will no doubt be pleased to see he has kick-started his career.

'I cannot keep that in my head all the time because I could have another move, but Crystal Palace is my home,' Zaha said.

'When I am here I feel more confident. I have lived in South London all my life and my family is here.'
