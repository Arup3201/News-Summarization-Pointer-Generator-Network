FIFA are employing the international PR agency — Weber Shandwick — used by England 2018’s doomed World Cup bid to crisis manage the build-up to the next global tournament in Russia in 2018.

The choice of Weber Shandwick after a beauty parade of PR companies in London comes despite England 2018’s bid campaign still being under scrutiny.

It was singled out for breaching bid regulations in FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert’s botched summary of Michael Garcia’s World Cup bid corruption report.

With their offices around the globe, Weber Shandwick personnel are likely to have contributed heavily to the England intelligence database. 

Department for Culture Media and Sport select committee chairman John Whittingdale has asked the FA to answer ‘serious’ questions about the intelligence. 

But FIFA have no qualms employing Weber Shandwick, who were willing to take on the difficult brief — especially with the Russia-Ukraine situation — after some rivals pulled out. 

FIFA fancifully first described their outside-agency recruitment as purely involving brand assistance. But it is all about damage limitation around the World Cup in Russia.

World champion Lewis Hamilton, who has split with Simon Fuller’s XIX agency, is not expected to sign for another F1 management team. 

He will rely on himself and his lawyer to negotiate his next multi-million pound driving contract with Mercedes and on specialist consultants in other areas.

The Lawn Tennis Association like to look after their own, judging by their £280,000 funding of a new, three-court indoor tennis facility at exclusive Surrey public school Reed’s in leafy Cobham — hardly an inner-city area deprived of tennis facilities.

The grand opening last week featured an exhibition match between Reed’s old boy Tim Henman and Andy Murray. Current pupil Jack Draper — 12-year-old son of former LTA chief executive Roger and a highly promising British junior — had a hit with the two stars. 

The LTA say the investment in further improving Reed’s high-performance tennis centre was made during Draper’s regime. They add there is now a new strategy in place under Michael Downey that scrutinises every facility spend in far more detail.

Sky Sports News personnel can’t seem to help making inappropriate comments on social media, despite the huge annoyance of their bosses. 

Presenter Tom White, who hosted SSN’s sports women of the year awards, posted a studio photograph of himself and colleague Peter Graves on Facebook with the message: ‘Discussing tactics ahead of tonight — Pete, you distract the ugly one, I’ll move in on her fit mate.’ 

Regular SSN freelance Emma Storey, who boasts about her serial swearing on Twitter, told her followers: ‘F******* Emirates has left my luggage in Dubai.’

QATAR WINS BY A HEAD

The contrast is extraordinary in the way Qatari owners have been embraced by English horse racing — to the extent the Sheikhs take tea with the Queen at Royal Ascot while also bankrolling yesterday’s glitzy Horserace Writers and Photographers Association annual awards. 

At the polar opposite is English football’s widespread mistrust of the way Qatar won the bid to stage the 2202 World Cup.

The best grace and favour house in British sport has to be the 10-bedroom Lodge at Ascot complete with expansive garden. 

However, Guy Henderson, the new CEO of Ascot, will have to make do with another house on the Ascot grounds when he arrives in January to succeed Charles Barnett. The Lodge is going to be utilised for corporate hospitality.

John Whittingdale recently wrote to FA Chairman Greg Dyke for clarification from the governing body

John Whittingdale, chairman of the Department for Culture Media and Sport select committee, surprised his own government department when he demanded the FA explain the blindingly obvious — why they didn’t include hearsay, rumour and gossip but kept to proven facts in their fully co-operative response to the World Cup bid corruption investigation. 

Whittingdale bizarrely didn’t involve DCMS officials before writing to FA chairman Greg Dyke and publishing, under parliamentary privilege, a speculative Sunday Times dossier.
