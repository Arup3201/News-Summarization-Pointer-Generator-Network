A teenager turned white as a ghost after the photo she took revealed possibly the first apparition captured on an iPad.

Charlotte Wearing, 16, got a big shock when a picture she took in the family backyard showed a man wearing a top hat and cape amongst the bushes.

The man, who has been nicknamed Jack, has visited the family home in Ward Green Barnsley regularly over the last four years.

Ghost in the garden: Charlotte Wearing, 16, took what could be the first image of a ghost using an iPad. A man wearing a top hat and cape appeared in the image, amongst the bushes in her backyard

Charlotte was taking a picture of a wood pigeon in the garden when she made the discovery which stunned her family, her mother Gillian said.

She said: ‘When she came down the stairs, her face was white and she was tapping the iPad because she’d got Jack.’

Charlotte has also seen a woman in a blue dress and shawl holding a baby in her parents’ room last year.

Gillian believes the pair might be linked to Jack in some way.

She said: ‘I feel so sorry for him because I think he’s looking for his wife and child. I think he should just move on but I’d love to know who he was and why he’s here.’

Charlotte says she would have preferred not to have seen the ghostly figure.

She said: ‘I don’t like it...I just don’t like it.’

Some previous ghost sightings were found to have been set up with an app which allows users to add a spooky figure to an image.

The eerie image comes as a couple captured footage of a 'child ghost' leaping over their car on CCTV footage recently in Clifton, Nottingham.
