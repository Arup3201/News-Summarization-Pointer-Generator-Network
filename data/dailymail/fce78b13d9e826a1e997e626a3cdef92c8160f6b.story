In a rather subdued start to what is dubbed the world’s ‘Last Great Race,’ 66 teams of sled dogs and their mushers ceremoniously strolled eleven miles down Anchorage streets Saturday, officially starting the Iditarod, Alaska’s grueling 1,000-mile-plus race.

Sunday’s ‘re-start’ marks the actual, competitive start of the race.

At 2pm, 50 miles north in Willow, 65 teams of the original 66 will begin the 41st running of the race.

Fun start: Alaska's famous Iditarod had its ceremonial start in Anchorage March 2 as adoring fans greeted mushers like Matt Failor (center)

Adoring fans: The 41-year-old race begins slowly, on trucked in snow on city streets while the real challenge begins 50 miles away in Willow, Alaska

Ed Stielstra of Michigan, this year's sole musher from from east of the Rocky Mountains, dropped out of the race after the ceremonial start due to injuries he sustained while training in February.

Today, mushers will leave the adoring crowds behind in favor of remote terrain shared mostly with their dogs.

Teams posed, Sunday, with fans and sailed their sleds on streets covered with trucked-in snow. Each sled carried an Iditarider, a fan who won the short ride at auction.

'Fun, with a capital F,' a smiling veteran musher Aliy Zirkle, the runner-up in last year's race, said Saturday. 'If you don't have a good time on Saturday with your dogs and all these fans, you're not in the right sport.'

'Tomorrow we're serious,' defending champion Dallas Seavey, of Willow, said Saturday between chatting with spectators and signing autographs for fans, including Bunky Nistler of Beach, N.D.

Nistler said the Iditarod was on her bucket list following her husband's death of cancer a year ago.

'I've been in love with the Iditarod for over eight years,' she said. 'This was my dream of a lifetime.'

From Willow, mushers and their dog teams will begin making their way through unforgiving wilderness toward the finish line in the old frontier town of Nome on Alaska's western coast.

Before reaching their destination, the teams will cross mountains, frozen rivers and forests before hitting the wind-pummeled coast.

They'll sign in at village checkpoints, sometimes stopping for mandatory layovers.

The winner will get a new truck and $50,400.

Big deal: The Iditarod is the premier event in dog sledding and attracts competitors from as far as New Zealand, where these pups are from

The rest of the $600,000 purse will be split between the next 29 mushers to cross the finish line.

Participants include six past Iditarod winners, including Seavey and his father, Mitch Seavey.

Dallas Seavey also is among six past winners of the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race, held just weeks before the Iditarod.

Big bucks: Contestant 60,Cindy Abbott, is one of 65 mushers vying to win a new truck and $50,400 along along with Iditarod glory

Lance Mackey of Fairbanks - the only musher to ever win both races the same year - just scratched from the Quest in February because of a team of ailing dogs. He is going for a fifth win in the Iditarod, this time taking mostly young dogs and only four veterans from the Quest.

At Saturday's ceremonial start, fans regularly stopped by to wish him luck.

Door prize: Number 48 Allen Moore (pictured) is also vying for top status, but 29 runners-up will split $600,000

'This is like a pregame warm-up,' Mackey said of the party-like atmosphere.

Sunday will bring a more highly charged approach among contenders.

'It's game time, and you get your game face on,' Mackey said. 'Put some blinders on - and go race.'
