A devoted husband who narrowly survived a suicide pact with his wife 12 months ago has killed himself using the same method, a coroner's court has heard.

Kenneth Brown, 75, died in his bathroom from carbon monoxide poisoning in the same spot where wife Helen, 71, was found under a blanket the year before.

Portsmouth Coroner's Court heard that he had been 'living in misery' since his wife's death, and was found on October 30 last year after sending letters to his sons explaining his decision.

Helen Brown became suicidal due to a severe bout of depression brought on by illness, and had attempted suicide several times before husband Kenneth agreed to help her kill herself.

Mr Brown, a former company director, decided he wanted to die alongside his wife to avoid being sent to jail afterwards. 

He survived the initial attempt after emergency services were called, but Portsmouth coroner's court heard the near miss had brought on a severe bout of depression.

Coroner David Horsley (pictured) said it was a 'very sad' case, and told Mr Brown's two sons that he hoped never to see them again

Police rushed to his address in Liss, Hampshire, for a second time on October last year after receiving a signed letter saying he had gassed himself, but were unable to save him.

His son James told the hearing how his father had been depressed following the death of his wife and had finally 'got what he wanted.'

He said: 'It's an unfortunate turn of events but ultimately I'm happy that he got what he wanted, as he'd only been living there in misery. 

'Maybe he would have come out of it in a few years but he wouldn't have seen the point in continuing, he wouldn't have seen the point in going on.'

Mr Brown had posted letters to his two sons shortly before killing himself explaining his decision. 

Portsmouth coroner David Horsley, who presided over the inquest into Mrs Brown's death, recorded a verdict of suicide, noting that retired company director Mr Brown was severely depressed at the time.

He told Mr Brown's sons: 'I really hope that I never see anybody from your family in this court again. I'm so, so sorry that you are here.

'The sad story is that basically he had given up since the death of your mother.

'He had chosen to withdraw from things and I think we can understand that really given the circumstances leading up to it including your mother's death. 

'All I can say is how terribly sorry I am to you and all of your family that this has happened. How dreadful for you, I really am sorry.'
