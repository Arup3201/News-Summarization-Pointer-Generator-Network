Marouane Fellaini grabbed Belgium’s equaliser off the bench as the World Cup dark horses turned around a half-time deficit to secure a 2-1 win in their Group H opener against Algeria.

And Chelsea’s Eden Hazard was the key man in the build-up to Dries Mertens’ winner as the Red Devils took all three points – so how did Belgium’s eight Premier League stars (and Algeria’s Nabil Bentaleb) get on?

Thibaut Courtois

Could
 do nothing to stop Sofiane Feghouli’s penalty but was otherwise mostly 
untested as Belgium spent most of the game in Algeria’s half. Will count
 himself as unlucky not to have kept a clean sheet with barely a save to
 make.

Vincent Kompany

Typically
 commanding performance from Belgium’s best defender as he barely put a 
foot wrong and dominated aerially. Looks set for a good World Cup to cap
 a fantastic season with Manchester City.

Jan Vertonghen

His
 dreadful challenge gave away penalty in the game’s decisive moment and 
it was a silly challenge to make – grabbing at Feghouli after being 
caught ball watching in the box. His terrible free-kick towards the end 
of the first half flew into the top tier made it a bad day at both ends 
for the versatile Tottenham defender.

Moussa Dembele

Subbed
 off in the second half after struggling to make an impact in midfield. 
Fellaini came on in his place and changed the game which could put 
Dembele’s place in the side in jeopardy.

Nacer Chadli

Should
 have squared a good chance mid-way through the first half but instead 
to choose shoot and in doing so probably wasted Belgium’s best chance. 
The fact that Marc Wilmots identified him as the first player to pull 
off as the Red Devils searched for an equaliser spoke volumes for the 
Tottenham midfielder’s performance.

Eden Hazard

Looked
 a little moody out on the wing early on and struggled to match his 
mid-season Chelsea form. Showed a couple of brief sparks of creativity 
and skill on the left hand side but the Algerians seemed ready for him 
until he brilliantly surged through the middle before squaring to Dries 
Mertens to finish emphatically for the winner.

Romelu Lukaku

Looked
 well out of sorts leading the line and failed to even register a single
 shot on goal. The towering centre forward tends to cause a nuisance for
 defences whether he scores in a game or not but he went missing for 
Belgium and was replaced by inexperienced 19-year-old striker Divock 
Origi before the hour mark.

Marouane Fellaini

Brought
 on as a second half substitute as Wilmots looked to turn the game 
around by adding some height in the penalty area. And despite having a 
difficult season with Manchester United, the bushy-haired midfielder 
showed that form is temporary with a header that flew in off the 
underside of the bar to draw Belgium level.  It was his first goal in 10
 months and he generally looked a handful in midfield.

And.. Nabil Bentaleb

Algeria's only Premier League based player aimed
 an elbow at club team-mate Dembele in the first half and was perhaps 
lucky not to see red. Otherwise was neat and tidy in midfield, as he 
often is for Tottenham, but struggled to make a big impact in the game 
against Belgium’s strong midfielders.
