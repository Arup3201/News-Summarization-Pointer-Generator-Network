Sham? Homeopathic practitioners may be offering false hope and causing real harm

Homeopaths are putting patients at risk by discouraging them from seeking essential medical treatment, according to a damning ruling by watchdogs.

Practitioners have also been found guilty of making unproven health claims in a landmark decision by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).

An assessment of treatments and claims made by the Society of Homeopaths suggests practitioners are offering false hope and may be causing real harm.

The ruling raises serious questions about the value of homeopathy, which has many well-known advocates, including Prince Charles and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

It will also reignite the row over why the NHS is spending £4million a year offering homeopathic remedies in the face of evidence that they do not work.

The ASA tested a series of statements made by the society, and rigorous analysis by an independent expert found there was insufficient evidence to support the claimed benefits.

Homeopathy involves treating the patient with highly diluted substances, given mainly in tablet form.

The idea is that even very low levels of substances, such as plant extracts, trigger the body’s natural system of healing.

But research has shown that the level of the substances offered to patients are so small – or even non-existent – that they cannot have a biological effect.

Most worrying is the concern that people who rely on homeopathic remedies are being diverted away from conventional treatments which could offer genuine benefits.

The society’s website said evidence existed to show homeopathy can treat a wide range of ailments.

But the ASA said several of these – bronchitis, osteoarthritis and vertigo – were conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, rather than relying on homeopathy. Consequently, it said the claims were a breach of its advertising codes.

Significantly, it said the evidence supplied by the society to back up its claims was not strong enough, and ruled that the claims were ‘misleading and had not been substantiated’.

The independent expert said the evidence presented by the society was ‘not convincing in terms of efficacy and it was unlikely to be generally accepted by the scientific community’.

The ASA has warned the society to stop making claims that are not supported by good evidence.Society chairman Diane Goodwin insisted that evidence did exist for the benefits of homeopathy, but that the society was prepared to change the way it marketed treatments.
