A local television news station in San Diego has called for Mayor Bob Filner to resign in a controversial music video parody of pop artist Robin Thicke's 'Blurred Lines.' 

The video by U-T TV, the cable affiliate of the Union-Tribune newspaper, features the station's young, female morning news hosts dancing in low-cut shirts and denying the advances of a gyrating man meant to represent Filner, who has been accused of sexual harassment by 14 women. 

Filner's face is superimposed on the man's head in the video.

The station changed the lyrics of Thicke's 'Blurred Lines' to say, 'If you can't hear what San Diego says, if you can't tell we're in a different age, maybe it's time you left, maybe you should resign, Mayor Filner you are terrifying.'

While the Filner character gyrates and rubs up on the women in the video, the words 'CREEPER' and 'RESIGN' flash across the screen. 

'You don't need that grabber,' the lead singer chants. 'That man is not your mayor.'

'He thinks you want it, but you don't want it,' the song continues. 'It makes us vomit... The man's a bully, he's just a creeper. And we would prefer if you resign. The nation's laughing.'

The video has sparked a bit of outrage in the journalism community, with some of the harshest criticism coming from the Voice of San Diego news site, a U-T competitor.

Some commenters on the U-T's video said the video objectifies women, while others said the lyrics portrayed Filner's alleged victims as strong for standing up to him

The managing editor of the site called the video 'vapid and embarrassing' in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.

Dean Nelson, director of the journalism program at Point Loma Nasarene University, told the Times that the 'the only thing a news organization has is its credibility in reporting the news' and 'this doesn't help.'

Some commenters on the U-T's video said the video objectifies women, while others said the lyrics portrayed Filner's alleged victims as courageous strong for standing up to him.

San Diego Mayor Bob Filner speaks during a news conference at city hall in San Diego on July 26. More than a dozen women have claimed that he sexually harassed them

Opponents of Filner hold placards during a 'Not Welcome Back' rally calling for him to resign at the Civic Center Plaza in downtown San Diego on August 12

'Whomever made this video failed completely,' wrote on commenter. 'First, the original music video has nude women prancing around. Second the song itself much like the person you guys are parodying, objectifies women. Lyrics doesn't change the fact that this song has baggage that negatively affects your message. Entertaining, yes but I wouldn't have chosen﻿ this song for the parody.'

Another wrote in support of the video: 'The lyrics have been changed from lyrics degrading to women to lyrics of empowerment.'

U-T San Diego responded to that comment, saying, 'Thanks for understanding... We are just trying to entertain with this video. That's all!'
