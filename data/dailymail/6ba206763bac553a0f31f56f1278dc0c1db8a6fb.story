The first day at primary school is an exciting prospect for any young girl.

There are so many hair styles to consider - pigtails, ponytail, bunches...

But little Harriet Russell had more choices than most, as she got to choose a wig as well.

The four-year-old, from West Bradford, Lancashire, has suffered from alopecia since she was two - and her parents say she is 'over the moon' about her new long blonde hair.

The four-year-old girl's hair began to fall out last September and within a week it had all gone

Harriet was given the wig, which will last for a year, from Hairoom in Bury, after her parents got in touch with the hair replacement specialists.

They were worried that her alopecia might set her apart from her new class mates.

The youngster originally had 
shoulder-length golden hair. But she woke up one day last September and 
found that it had fallen out over her pillow.

Within a week, Harriet was bald and she had to wear a head scarf.

Consultants at Burnley General Hospital warned Harriet's father Paul Russell, 54, an account executive, and mother Emma Russell, 43, a teaching assistant at Salesbury School, Blackburn, that her hair may never grow back.

Mrs Russell said: 'Harriet has been so excited she is over the moon. She has been telling everyone that she is going to have new hair. She can’t wait to put lots of clips in it and have it in all different styles.

'We were asked what she would like, Harriet said she didn’t want a fringe but wanted long light blonde hair with layers at the side. Her sister has long hair and she can’t wait to look like her.'

'We couldn’t have asked for better timing. As a young girl she is starting to get self conscious about her looks and children at nursery ask why she doesn’t have hair.'

Harriet's parents hope the wig will allow her to blend in with her new class mates. Pictured with her brother Jacob and sister Leah
