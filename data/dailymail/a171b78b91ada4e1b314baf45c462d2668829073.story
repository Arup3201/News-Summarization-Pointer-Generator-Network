When a couple in Hawaii came to buy a Jack Russell named Sally Mae for $85 from an animal shelter, staff happily handed the dog over, and took a picture to mark the occasion.

But less than an hour later a very similar picture appeared on Craigslist which seemed to show the same dog up for sale - but this time for $200.

The post even claimed Sally Mae was half her age, advertising her as a five-year-old dog instead of her actual age of ten.

Jack Russell Sally Mae was adopted from shelter on Hawaii by couple who paid $85 - only to reappear in a Craigslist advert an hour later on sale for $200

Followers of the Hawaii Humane Society shelter on Facebook spotted the similarities between the dogs after the woman holding Sally appeared wearing the same t-shirt.

The ad claimed: 'My boyfriend and I is [sic] too caught up with work since we have 2 jobs each and she needs a family that'll give her attention. Please.'

Furious website users demanded that the new owner return Sally Mae to the shelter, prompting workers from the animal home to contact the couple.

While local news reports suggested that the woman initially refused to return the animal, the Hawaii Humane Society have now confirmed Sally Mae was given back to them.

Jacque Vaughn, a spokesman for the shelter, said: 'Great news. Sally Mae was returned to us when the adopters recognized they could not care for her.

'She was adopted to a loving family this afternoon. We applaud them for returning her to us. They did the right thing and that's all that matters.'

The ad listed Sally as five-years-old, which she is in fact ten. The shelter said they contacted Sally's owners who have now returned the animal after 'realizing they were unable to care for her'

But social media users have have called the shelter's adoption process into question.

Thomas Nitta wrote on the group's Facebook page saying: 'I wonder how they know these people are a loving family? Just wondering.'

Callmea Cab added: 'The public outcry helped to prevent Sally Mae from being flipped on CL and more importantly made HHS realize that they need to update/revamp their adoptionÂ  policy.'
