Robert Chesters (pictured) is accused of drugging his own daughter, so he could have sex with her friend

A widowed father of three has been accused of drugging his 12-year-old daughter so he could have sex with her friend during sleepovers at his home during a three week period.

Robert Chesters, of Lebanon, Connecticut, is alleged to have given his daughter a liquid sleeping aid so that he would not be disturbed when he slept with her friend.

The 42 year old is alleged to have met the young girl when his daughter brought her to their home in for sleepovers in August.

Police said text messages found on the girl's phone suggested Chesters was drugging his own daughter so that she would sleep while he had sex with her friend.

One message said: 'I am so lost without you :-( [blank] is gone next weekend And [blank] will have Benadryl so you can lay with me comfortably and love me,' according to a text from Chesters to the girl on Sept. 8.

Another text read: 'When we made love last night your heart really showed through everything.'

Court papers revealed Chesters suspected the relationship wouldn't last and he even texted her at 7 a.m. on the day police were closing in on him.

'As a last resort tell them [blank] will lose her dad for ten years if they say anything. No matter what happens I LOVE YOU.' he allegedly wrote in the text message.

The relationship was discovered by the girl's friends who found the text messages on her phone and told authorities in their middle school.

He spoke to officials at her middle school who tipped off police.

When police went to arrest him on September 11th , Chesters was found sitting in his pickup, unresponsive and a suicide note on the floor.

He was taken to hospital and then to prison once he had recovered.

In court last Wednesday, Chesters pleaded not guilty to first-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor.

His next court appearance is on November 21.
