Like many little boys, four-year-old  Rio Woolf dreams of following in the  footsteps of his sporting idols.

And his chances of achieving that  ambition have taken a giant leap  forward – thanks to some help from his biggest hero.

A delighted Rio received a hi-tech running blade for Christmas after Britain’s Paralympic sprint champion Jonnie  Peacock heard of his plight.

‘I really love my new special leg,’ he said. ‘Now I can run about and do lots of things I’ve never done before.’

Rio was inspired to start running after meeting his hero Paralympian runner Jonnie Peacock

Rio, from Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire,
was born without a shinbone, knee or ankle joint, and had his lower 
right leg amputated at 14 months.

He was originally fitted with a rigid
NHS prosthetic limb, but it slowed him down when he ran. Peacock, 19, 
who won 100m gold and broke the Paralympic record at the London Games 
this summer, put Rio’s parents in touch with experts at a prosthetic 
limbs clinic after meeting the family at an event.

Dorset Orthopaedic, based in Ringwood,
Hampshire, offered to help for free after watching a video of Rio 
running. Now there’s a spring in his step after the £4,000 lightweight 
carbon-fibre blade – decorated with his favourite character Fireman Sam –
was fitted on Christmas Eve.

His parents Trevor, 47, a bathroom fitter, and Juliette, 44, are equally overjoyed.

Mrs Woolf said: ‘It’s a dream come 
true for Rio and is the perfect Christmas present. He is over the moon 
and very excited and after it was fitted he couldn’t stop jumping up and
down.

‘He’s been so captivated watching 
people running in the Paralympics with their “special legs”, as he calls
them, and now he can run too.

'It is a dream come true for Rio and is the perfect Christmas present.

'He is over the moon and very excited and after it was fitted he couldn't stop jumping up and down.

'We took Rio along to the Paralympic Primary Games for children and he loved participating, even with his NHS leg.

'It
was then he started to show he loved to run. He said it was his 
favourite thing. The only problem was that his old leg was very heavy.

'Despite this he was running quite fast and we could see how much he enjoyed it. He had the speed, but not the right equipment.

'Now there is nothing stopping him. 
He loves the Paralympics and although he is only four, I think he will 
see it through to the end.

'He has shown promise at such a young age and he has told me he wants to get back on the track already.

Standing tall: Rio's blade is 150g lighter than his old NHS prosthetic

'My
husband and I are incredibly thankful to Dorset Orthopaedic and we are 
hugely indebted to them for giving Rio this amazing opportunity.'

So Rio can continue wearing the blades as he grows and needs replacements, his mother has started a fundraising campaign.

Rio has worn NHS prosthetic limbs for the last three years after he was born with a one-in-a-million condition, Tibial Aplasia.

His parents decided to have his leg amputated so he wouldn't be restricted to a wheelchair and could have the option to walk with a false leg.

Prosthetic legs on the NHS are heavier than the blade and take up to three months to make before Rio can use them, which he outgrows quickly.

Bob Watts, managing director of Dorset Orthopaedic, said: 'The blade and socket we have had made for Rio is 150g lighter than the NHS prosthetic legs.

'The blade is made out of carbon fibre which is very light, springs back into shape, and 95 per cent of energy you put into it will come back during running.

'The blade is guaranteed to last for at least a year, but as a child grows the socket will need to be replaced after six to nine months of use.'

Mrs Woolf is now fundraising to try and raise money so that Rio can continue wearing the blades as he grows and needs new sockets, which cost £2,500 on their own.
