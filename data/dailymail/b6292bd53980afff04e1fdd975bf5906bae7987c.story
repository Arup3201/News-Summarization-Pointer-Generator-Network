Flowers will no longer be airlifted to loved ones after the Federal Aviation Administration began cracking down on commercial drone use.

The FAA told FlowerDeliveryExpress.com that drone use is only permitted on a case-by-case basis and that any drone use must be pre-authorized.

Regardless, one drone delivery did successfully occur on February 8. 2014 in Detroit.

If allowed, the flower company would encourage customers to call the office and place an order for delivery

An employee would then take down the client's coordinates for delivery

The company's CEO, Wesley Berry, said that the FAA may have told them to quit using to use commercial drones but that they asked the company to 'quit it' in a polite and professional way.

'Cupid’s wings have been clipped,' said Wesley Berry to CBS.

He added, 'The FAA was extremely professional and polite,' he said. 'I couldn’t have been chastised in a nicer way.'

The FAA said that drone deliveries need to be closely monitored to insure safety should something happen to occur.

The company uses traditional methods of delivery to customers all over the United States year round but planned to deliver free bouquets of roses to a beta test group of customers on Valentines Day.

Workers would then prepare bouquets to be shipped off for delivery by drone or other method

An employee would then prepare the drone for its airborne journey

The FAA did not say when they would devise regulations for drone delivery but did say that there is a plan underway.

Berry employes other methods of rapid delivery such as using trucks with pre-made bouqets that travel around for speedy delivery.

In order to test more types of delivery methods, the website has launched a consumer beta test program to experiment with other types of delivery. Customers can sign up on line.

Earlier this year, a beer company called Lakemaid successfully attempted to use drones for delivery to ice fisherman but they were ultimately barred by the FAA as well.

Drone use will not be permitted unless they are strictly regulated.

The drone would lift up over the company parking lot

It would fly high over the road and the trees

It would zero in on a client's instructed coordinates

It would then land right on a person's doorstep for them to open and enjoy
