Lacking: Patricia Hodge, who plays Miranda Hart's mother Penny in hit comedy Miranda, says there is a lack of roles for older women in TV and theatre

Actress Patricia Hodge has bemoaned the lack of roles for older women in television and theatre.

The 66-year-old says all the best work goes to Dame Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave and Dame Maggie Smith, leaving little for anyone else of her age.

Miss Hodge, who plays Miranda Hart’s mother Penny in the hit comedy series Miranda, told an audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival that the lack of roles for older women was a ‘hot topic’ in showbusiness.

‘It is very difficult for us who are in this age group to talk about it because it makes you sound like an embittered old woman,’ she said.

‘Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave and Maggie Smith are on a level where they will always get work because whatever is on offer will go to them first.

‘They are a band of angels up there who are ascending to heaven and are untouchable.

‘But for everyone else there is not nearly enough representation – but you can’t create it overnight.

‘Even if you asked every playwright in the country to write a play for older women it still wouldn’t be enough. I think it needs to grow, that realisation that there is a whole section of our community which is under represented.’

She said she was fortunate she had landed such a good role in Miranda, which was an example of what can be achieved by women in the world of drama.

‘It has broken the mould,’ she said. ‘We have got four very strong roles for women. It is directed by a woman and produced by a woman and the executive director is a woman.

‘I think the BBC feel a little bit proud of it because they can hold it up as “We are doing our bit trying to change the balance of power”.’
