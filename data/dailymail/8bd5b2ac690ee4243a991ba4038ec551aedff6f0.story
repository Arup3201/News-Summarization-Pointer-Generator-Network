One is famous for his passion for the environment, his blue-blooded ancestry and multimillion pound bank balance. The other is Prince Charles.

It was a meeting of minds as TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall gave the famously green Prince Charles a tour of River Cottage HQ in the Devonshire town of Axminster today.

During the visit, the heir to the throne was shown how to forage for food before being given a guided tour of Fearnley-Whittingstall's vegetable patch - much to Charles' delight.

Joining the pair was Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who was on stylish form in a cream crÃªpe de Chine shirt dress enlivened with a diamond brooch and her trademark pearl studs.

She too appeared to enjoy meeting Fearnley-Whittingstall and at one point, was seen bursting into laughter as they chatted.

The royal couple were at River Cottage on day two of their annual tour of Devon and Cornwall to hear more about one of Fearnley-Whittingstall's eco-friendly schemes - Landshare.

While making his TV series River Cottage Spring which aired in 2008, the chef helped a group of Bristol families start a smallholding on derelict
 council land.

Although Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's successful Fish Fight campaign is over, other issues remain.

Most pressing is that of fish stocks, with seabass, razor clams and halibut among the species with perilously low numbers.

Other types, among them pollock, mackerel and anchovies, are fine to eat - for now.

Fishing methods have also come under increased scrutiny, with purse seine nets blamed for the deaths of thousands of dolphins.

Fearnley-Whittingstall has now added his name to the list of advocates for low impact line fishing as well as marine conservation zones.

For more information, see the Marine Conservation Society website.

So inspiring did the experience prove, he decided to see if it 
would work nationwide, and Landshare, which now includes more than 50,000 people, was created to bring keen growers 
and landowners together.

The Prince of Wales, who has long championed the merits of smallholding, and Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall share yet more common ground when it comes to farming.

A keen supporter of all things organic, the prince has an eco-friendly farm at Highgrove in Gloucestershire, while Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage smallholding - which includes vegetables, pigs and hens - is run along green lines.

Both men also share a passion for fishing, with Prince Charles supporting charities such as The Fishermen's Mission and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's own Fish Fight campaign.

The latter, heavily promoted on TV and backed by environmental charities, was aimed at ending the wasteful practice of discarding perfectly good fish as a result of EU quotas and encouraging supermarkets and other retailers to switch to sustainably sourced seafood.

Although the EU has now introduced rules that outlaw discards, other problems such as the use of dolphin killing purse seine fishing nets and plummeting fish stocks remain.
