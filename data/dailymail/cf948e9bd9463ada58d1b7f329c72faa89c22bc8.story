'He is in hospital simply because the doctors want to be absolutely sure that he is strong enough to go home and nothing is going to recur.'

Mr Mandela
was admitted to a Pretoria hospital at about midnight on Wednesday. The nation, and his supporters around the world has waited anxiously for news of his condition.

Treatment: Mediclinic Heart Hospital in Pretoria where Mr Mandela is reportedly being treated for pneumonia

Following his release 
from prison in 1990, he was widely credited with averting even 
greater bloodshed by helping the country's transition to democratic
rule.

The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has 
been vulnerable to respiratory problems since contracting 
tuberculosis during his 27-year imprisonment for fighting white racist 
rule in his country.

The elderly are especially vulnerable
to pneumonia, symptoms of which can include fever, chills, a
cough, chest pain and shortness of breath.
