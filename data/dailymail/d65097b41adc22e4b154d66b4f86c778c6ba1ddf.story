After 69 years of marriage Julia Knight has finally learned of her husband’s secret wartime bravery.

Leslie, who died in June aged 96, never spoke of how he cheated death, suffered malaria in Egypt, was bombed in Greece and took part in the D-Day landings.

But he secretly typed up his 10-page 'My Wartime Story' - which Julia discovered among his papers shortly after his death.

Secret life: A World War II veteran kept his harrowing stories secret until he died and his wife of 69 years only found out after he died. Leslie Knight, 96, never mentioned he had survived malaria in Egypt or being bombed in Greece as a soldier the Royal Army Ordnance Corps.

Almost until the end he’d never spoken to anyone of his experiences during the Second World War.

While battling dementia in his final days, she’d sometimes find him with a tear in his eye, speaking of 'poor boys' lost in the conflict.

Shortly after he died in May, Mrs Knight and daughter Ellen Gooding discovered an A4 envelope with: 'My Wartime Story' written on it.

Inside were ten printed pages, secretly typed up over 16 months in 2006 and 2007, giving a matter-of-fact account of his role in the conflict. 

It detailed how Leslie, a Royal Army Ordnance Corps soldier, cheated death several times, including suffering malaria in Egypt and being bombed in Greece, and told of many of the friends he had lost.

Mrs Knight, 92, said: 'Near the end he started to talk. He never used to show emotion, but every time I came in he was wiping his eyes.

'He kept saying "poor boy" and "he never had a chance"'

'Before that we had been married 69 years and he never mentioned it - he didn’t want people to know.'

Mrs Knight said she found his accounts while she was looking for insurance papers and wills.

She said: 'When we read it I was quite shocked at what he’d been through. It was very powerful and very sad.'

The couple met after Mr Knight survived the D-Day landings. He ended up in a pub Mrs Knight’s family owned in Brussels at the end of 1944.

Both had been previously engaged, but both lost their partners during the war. Mrs Knight returned after the German surrender of June 1945 with an engagement ring, and they got married on August 25.

After living in various places, including with Leslie’s parents in Thorrington, they settled in a newly-built council house off Monkwick Avenue, Colchester, where they lived for more than 60 years.

Leslie’s funeral in June was held at Monkwick’s St Margaret Church, which he helped to build in the Sixties and Seventies when he was not working for Crittall Windows in Witham.

Hero: Mrs Knight described her husband as a generous man who was always helping people. He left daughter Ellen, 59, and grandsons Daniel and Anthony

Leslie Knight wrote how, after signing up and going through training shortly after the war broke in 1939, he had been posted to Egypt to confront the Italians.

He was soon struck down with malaria and rushed to hospital in Alexandria, where he had a 'miraculous escape from death'.

After recuperating in Cairo, Leslie was sent to Greece early in 1941. There, near the city of Larissa, his unit was attacked by German bombers.

He wrote: 'I then ran to what I thought was an empty shelter and fell onto a young mother with her baby.

'It was then that I realised what war was all about and we parted as I prayed to our Lord for her. I had lost my unit and everything that goes with it.'

Leslie fled to Athens and then Crete, where the British army mounted a fierce resistance before again retreating in a convoy which was repeatedly attacked by German bombers.

Respite finally came back in Egypt until he was sent to the Middle East before linking up with General Montgomery’s Desert Rats.

After successfully pushing through Africa into Italy, Leslie was ordered to port and 'back to Blighty' early in 1944.

He recalled: 'I can remember whilst doing a Guard-duty listening to a nightingale and thinking to myself how wonderful it was to be back in England'.

But Leslie’s war was not over. By June he was in a landing craft and taking part in D-Day.

He wrote: 'When daylight came the sight [was] formidable, noise most deafening [and] weather rough as we approached the French Coast.

'Order was given as we approached the coast for the front of the craft to be set down...

'Bombs and gunfire was everywhere. On dry land it was foot down and driving as quickly as things would allow.'

Leslie’s unit made it to Brussels, where he met his future wife. By then, his active involvement in the war was effectively at an end.
