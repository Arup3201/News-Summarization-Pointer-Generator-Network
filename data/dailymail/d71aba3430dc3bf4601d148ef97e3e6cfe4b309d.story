Six summers ago Jake Buxton was without a club and told by his wife Danielle to make a career from football within one season or abandon the sport for a steady 9-5 job instead.

Shifts spray-painting cars or working on building sites beckoned before Nigel Clough offered Buxton a chance at Burton Albion in the Conference.

They won the title together, Buxton was named player of the season, and then both moved to Derby County – where the central defender is now one win away from the Barclays Premier League.

It has been quite a climb up the Football League ladder but such is Buxton’s standing in the squad he will deliver the pre-match rallying call when the players assemble in a huddle on the Wembley pitch, drawing on his own experiences to find the right emotive trigger for team-mates.

Buxton, who was released by Mansfield Town in 2008 after relegation, said: ‘I took it to heart.

'That summer, you wait for the phone to ring, then it’s the end of June, players were starting pre-season and I didn’t have a club.

‘I had mortgages and bills to play like every normal person. The only call came from Nigel Clough. It was either get a job, or take the opportunity of playing at Burton Albion part-time.

‘My missus gave me an ultimatum of one season or I had to get a trade.

'I was spray painting cars for an insurance company, I did a bit of building work, labouring.

‘Burton were training at the FA centre which was just being built. I was very lucky that season was the final piece of the jigsaw that got us out of the Conference.’

Buxton admits he was ‘hurt’ when Clough was sacked last September but says Steve McClaren has improved the team. ‘Nigel’s been in touch and wished the lads all the best,’ adds Buxton.

Wembley will be a new experience for McClaren’s young team, who give away plenty of top-flight experience to Harry Redknapp’s high-earning side.

Derby’s wages top out at £12,000 per week while the likes of Joey Barton and Bobby Zamora have £60,000 per week deals at Queens Park Rangers.

Buxton’s career has been a world away from such mega contracts and even though riches will follow in the Premier League his pre-match address will steer away from money as a motivation.

‘The huddles have all been quite emotional, I’ve tried to hit home, talk about things which might mean a lot to the players,’ he says.

‘We talk about your family, your kids or maybe the haters - people who’ve doubted you over the course of your career. 

‘The drive is to play in the Premier League, to play at Stamford Bridge, Emirates, Old Trafford. It’s not about money and never has been. It’s about playing in the highest league as a player.’

The 29-year-old, who became a father in the last year to 11-month-old Beau, believes Derby’s youth can prove decisive.

‘QPR have the name players and they’ve all played in the division above. We’ve got a lot of young players with energy. If they want to stand toe to toe with us and we perform as we have done over 48 games then there’ll only be one outcome.’
