Five-time NFL Most Valuable Player Peyton Manning will return for an 18th NFL season and has agreed to a $4 million paycut with the Denver Broncos.

The Denver Post and ESPN on Wednesday reported that Manning's pay will be cut from $19 million to $15 million. 

The Broncos are expected to make an official announcement of the deal today(Thursday), once the 38-year-old Manning passes a medical exam.

He has spent the week considering his options while sunning it up in Miami Beach, Florida with his wife Ashley and two children.

Manning's return raises the prospect of him becoming, at 39, the oldest QB to win Superbowl, should the Denver Broncos win it later this year. 

On Tuesday he swapped his football kit for a tight white T-shirt and snazzy swimming shorts as he played with his young children at the pool.

After taking his physical and signing his revised contract Thursday at Broncos headquarters, Manning will head home until the Broncos reconvene April 13 for the start of offseason workouts. 

The team's general manager, John Elway, said in February that the quarterback would thrive in the team's new offensive system.
