Shamed: Reverend Brian Shipsides raked in at least £30,000 conducting sham marriages between 2007 and 2010

A parish vicar who raked in at least £30,000 carrying out sham marriages has been ordered to repay just a fraction of his ill-gotten gains.

Reverend Brian Shipsides, 56, was 
jailed for four-and-a-half years in April for conducting hundreds of 
bogus ceremonies at All Saints church in East London.

Charging
£140 a time, he would marry EU nationals with non-EU spouses so they 
could claim the right to work and live in the country.

Shipsides
had helped nearly 250 immigrants before the plot was smashed by 
officers from the Metropolitan Police and the UK Border Agency in 2010. 

He had travelled around the world on his undeclared income including trips to Egypt and the Far East.

At a Proceeds of Crime hearing at Inner London Crown Court yesterday he was ordered to pay back just £10,792.

If he fails to pay back the cash within the next six months he faces a further six months imprisonment.

Shipsides had taken a cut from his Nigerian ‘fixer’ Amudalat Ladipo, 31, who also charged immigrants to arrange the weddings.

When Ladipo was arrested at the church, couples were still queuing up outside for their bogus ceremonies.

She dumped a brown envelope in some bushes stuffed with fake identity documents for use in the marriages.

By marrying an EU national - mainly Portuguese and Dutch in this case - hundreds of non-EU spouses were successfully married by the scam and hoped to take on the same rights of residence and work.

Once wed a ‘strikingly high proportion’ then made applications to the Home Office for the right to remain in the country.

In
some cases, EU nationals were even flown into Britain just so the 
marriages could take place before being flown straight out again.

Since the investigation, just two phoney brides or grooms 
who took part in the bogus marriages have been deported while eight have been
jailed. Dozens have gained the right to stay in Britain.

Shipsides admitted conspiracy to facilitate breaches of immigration laws and was jailed for four-and-a-half years.

Mother-of-two Ladipo, of Grosvenor Road, Dagenham,  was convicted of the same charge and jailed for three years.

Suspicious: Police noticed a spike in marriage ceremonies at All Saints church in East London

Sentencing Shipsides at the time, Judge Peter Grobel said he 
had shown an ‘arrogant disregard for the legal and church requirements 
that couples should attempt to live together in a subsisting 
relationship.’

It is thought  Nigerian
Ladipo, described as a ‘prolific and resourceful liar’, was involved in fixing sham marriages at other churches across the UK.

Ladipo, who has a six-year-old son, had her immigration appeal refused four months after the swoop when the Home Office voided her marriage.

During the investigation, police unearthed the church’s marriage registers to 1971, which demonstrated the sudden spike in weddings.

In the two year and seven months period prior to the scam, there were just 15 ceremonies, compared to 250 when the fraudsters were working.

Concerned church authorities tried to tighten the regulations by requiring vicars to visit couples in advance of the ceremonies.

They had a ‘fraction’ of Shipsides’ knowledge about what was going on but told Shipsides to call off one suspicious union.

Since the scam the regulations for the diocese have been further tightened, with the UK Border Agency requiring notice of the marriage banns having been read in church in advance of ceremonies.

Shipsides, the son of a Merseyside police officer read English at Reading University in the 1970s, before receiving his theology training in the 1980s.

He worked as a deacon in Leeds in 1982, before being ordained as a priest the following year.

In 1986 he moved to London where he took a post at a church in the Notting Hill area, before becoming priest in charge at All Saints and St Edmund’s.

Simon Prankard, from the UK Border Agency, said: ‘I am extremely pleased the court has ordered Shipsides to repay this money. By carrying out these weddings, not only was he lining his own pockets but also abusing the high degree of trust others had placed in him.

‘Hopefully this ruling will send out a clear message that not only will we investigate and secure convictions for those involved in this type of criminality, we will also go after the profits they make.

‘This is a successful conclusion to what was a long and complex investigation.’
