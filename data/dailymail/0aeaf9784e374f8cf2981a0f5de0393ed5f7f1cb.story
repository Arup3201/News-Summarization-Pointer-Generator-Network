Apple's newly-recruited head of retail was paid more than $70 million in her first year with the company - $60 million more than CEO Tim Cook.

Angela Ahrendts, 54, was poached by the tech firm in May after eight years as Burberry's CEO, where she was the UK's highest-paid CEO with $26.3 million.

With a transition package worth $73.4 million in stock awards for 2014, she is now the highest-paid Apple executive.

Ahrendts, the firm's only female executive, was brought over to oversee the expansion of Apple's online and retail stores, with a view to expanding in China.

As one of the most influential voices in the fashion world, she was also seen as a valuable addition to the team developing the highly-anticipated iWatch.

In an SEC filing, Apple explained Ahrendts' paycheck by stressing her 'experience' and 'ability'.

'The recruitment of Ms Ahrendts provided an extraordinary addition to the Company's executive team with the experience and ability to lead both the retail and online businesses,' Apple wrote. 

'In determining her transition package, the Compensation Committee considered Ms Ahrendts' compensation arrangement at Burberry and the amounts that she was expected to receive in future years.

'At the time, Ms Ahrendts was among the highest paid executives in the U.K. and held unvested Burberry equity awards with a value of approximately $37 million.'

Though most of the $73.4 million was earned in shares, Ahrendts' basic salary is $440,000.

Tim Cook received $9.2 million in shares in 2014, while his salary increased 43 per cent, from $1.4 million to $2 million.
