One in 10 pupils at more than 1,600 schools play truant so often they miss a month’s lessons every year, latest figures have revealed.

There are 677 primary schools and 977 secondary schools where more than 10 per cent of students miss more than one in six days.

One MP said the figures were ‘deeply worrying’ and urged parents to take more responsibility for making children their children got the education that they need.

Published figures for the last full school year show the scale of ‘persistent absentees’ in England’s schools.

A total of 76 schools  - 50 secondary and 26 primary - have more than 20 per cent of pupils classes as ‘persistent absentees’ for missing more than 15 per cent of lessons.

Under rules introduced last September, headteachers can now impose a £60 spot fine on parents who condone truancy, up from £50 under the Labour government.

But ministers have been urged to go further and consider docking child benefit from parents who refuse to pay fines.

Tory MP Andrew Griffths, who uncovered
the figures in parliament, said: ‘It is deeply worrying to uncover that
so many pupils are missing vital days of schooling.

‘Of
course the teachers and schools have a role to play in tackling 
absences but it is also the responsibility of parents to make sure that 
their children attend school to get the education that they require.’

Crays Hill Primary School in Basildon, Essex, whic is attended by children from the Dale Farm Traveller's Camp, recorded the highest level of persistent absentees in 2010-11

Education Secretary Michael Gove has 
warned of an ‘educational underclass’ of children who will never spend 
enough time in school to achieve academic success.

Challenged
over the coalition’s record on attendance recently, education minister 
Elizabeth Truss said: ‘The Government agreed Charlie Taylor's 
recommendation to tackle truancy by improving pupils' overall 
attendance, and by focusing in primary schools to tackle poor attendance
early.

Education minister Elizabeth Truss has insisted the government has toughened up fines for parents whose children play truant

‘And we have uprated the penalty fines for parents who shirk their responsibility to ensure their children attend school.’

The Department for Education insisted that overall levels of persistent absenteeism had fallen from 8.6 per cent in 2006-07 
to 6.1 per cent in 2010-11.

Among secondary schools, Sir Henry Cooper School in Kingston upon Hull record the highest level, with 31 per cent of pupils missing more than 15 per cent of school days.

At five schools - Primrose High School in Leeds, David Lister School in Kingston upon Hull, The Basildon Upper Academy in Essex, Childwall School in Liverpool and the Manchester Creative and Media Academy for Boys - the proportion of persistent absentees stood at 25 per cent.

A full breakdown of the figures for primary schools shows that almost a third (32 per cent) of pupils at Stanbridge Lower School in Bedfordshire were persistent absentees, rising to 43 per cent at Braybrooke Primary School in Northamptonshire and 84 per cent at Crays Hill Primary School in Essex, which is the local school of the controversial Dale Farm traveller site.

Hayley Dyer, headteacher, Crays Hill Primary School said: ‘The school has made great strides in improving attendance over the last three years. 

‘Engaging with our parents about the importance of continuous education has seen this improve month on month particularly during this academic year.

‘We of course recognise there is still some way to go and while the school is sensitive to the cultural traditions of our pupils we are clear in communicating with parents that good attendance enables their children to learn to their full potential.’

A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'Poor attendance at school can have a permanent and damaging effect on a child’s education and development.

'That is why we have lowered the persistent absence threshold so schools tackle the problem earlier – and in fact the number of pupils persistently absent has continuously fallen over the last five years.'
