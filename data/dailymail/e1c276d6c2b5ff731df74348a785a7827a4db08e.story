At first he thought it was a 'harmless insect bite'.

But little did Henry Konietzky know that, 28 painful hours after noticing a small abrasion on his foot, he would become the ninth person this year to be killed by the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria.

Pictures have emerged of the tiny legion that appeared on the Florida father's right foot on Sunday, the day after he went crabbing in the Halifax River in Florida with his wife, Patty.

This was the first sympton that manifested on Henry Konietzky after he was infected with the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria in a Florida river at the weekend. Mr Konietzky died on Monday after the infection overtook his body

Horrific: Henry Konietzky had no previous medical issues before encountering the bacteria

Mr Konietzky had stepped on some ants before getting into the water, sustaining small bites.

Doctors believe this was the gateway that allowed him to become infected by the flesh-eating bacteria, which is considered one of the deadliest strands of bacterium in the world and usually forms every year in the warm saltwater swimming holes of Florida.

As the wound started to fester, the Palm Coast man was rushed to hospital, where he was administered with numerous courses of antibiotics.

'Nothing was touching it. Nothing even phased it,' his sister-in-law, Debbie stack, told Click Orlando.

'This bacteria crept through his body like acid - it was the most horrific I've ever seen in my life' his wife, Patty Konietzky, told ABC News.

Mrs Konietzky said the legions started to spread once they got her husband to the hospital and, 28 hours after being admitted, he died from organ failure.

It is the ninth death in 2013 connected to the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria in the Volusia and Flager counties, with health officials warning locals to take serious care when visiting saltwater spots, especially with open wounds.

Distraught: His family members said they wish they took the symptoms more seriously. Mr Konietzky is pictured

Spread fast: Mr Konietzky (pictured with his daughter) had awoken to what looked like an insect bite on his leg. Before long it started festering and he was rushed to hospital, where he died the following night

However, two men have recovered from the infection after contracting it fishing in the Indian River Lagoon, reported 10 News.

Vibrio
vulnificus is a naturally-occurring bacteria in warm sea water that 
belongs to the same family of bacterium as cholera and requires salt to 
live.

According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) the bacteria can also be contracted from eating contaminated raw seafood.

Linked to other cases: Nine deaths in the state of Florida have been linked to the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria (pictured), which normally lives in warm seawater

When open wounds on otherwise healthy 
people are exposed to warm seawater containing the bacteria, the skin 
can become infected, leading to a breakdown and ulceration of the skin.

Immunocompromised people face a 
deadlier risk: they have a higher possibility of the bacteria invading 
the bloodstream, leading to potentially fatal complications.

If the bacteria is ingested, healthy people can experience vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.

For
people with weaker immune systems, consuming Vibrio vulnificus can 
infect the bloodstream, leading to 'a severe and life-threatening 
illness characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood pressure 
(septic shock), and blistering skin lesions,' according to the CDC.Â 

Bloodstream infections by the bacteria are fatal about 50 per cent of the time.

Patients
are treated with antibiotics, and according to the CDC, infected wounds
must be treated aggressively - sometimes meaning amputation of an 
infected limb.

Deadly bacteria: The bacteria can be contracted by eating contaminated raw seafood which can lead to vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, or through open wounds such as insect bites that contact the water
