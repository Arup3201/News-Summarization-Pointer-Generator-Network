A blind couple have accused a bus company of 'blatant discrimination' after a driver refused to allow them on a coach because there was no space in the designated disabled section. 

Cindy Bennett and Mike Mello, who are both visually impaired, said they felt 'uncomfortable and unwelcome' when the driver ordered them off the bus in downtown Seattle.

The pair pointed out that they are entitled to sit in any section of a bus, and do not have to use the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) seats just because they are eligible to.

'He kept saying the ADA section is full. You're going to have to get off the bus behind me,' Cindy told KIRO 7. 'He was yelling at us. It was in public. It was really demeaning.'

Mike added: 'Were we really in 2014 told to get off a bus? Did that just happen to us? That's ridiculous.'

The couple are now calling for all Metro drivers to get better training so that the same mistake is not repeated on city buses.

Metro confirmed that blind passengers are not required to ride in any one section on the bus, and apologized for the driver's 'unacceptable' behavior. 

It added that the driver in question had been identified and his supervisor will now decide whether or not he will face any disciplinary action.

The couple were boarding a bus in downtown Seattle when the driver told them they would have to wait 

Mike said: 'Just because we are eligible to sit and that section we have the choice not to do that. And we also have the choice to just be anywhere we want. 

'And this guy's attitude was so rude and so hurtful I didn't know how to respond to him I was in shock,' he added.

Speaking to Fox 13, Marci Carpenter, president of the National Federation of the Blind of Washington, described the incident as 'completely over-the-top behavior'.

She said: “This driver should have a clear understanding that you never, ever speak to a passenger this way.”
