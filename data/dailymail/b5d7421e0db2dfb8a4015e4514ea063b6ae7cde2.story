A paedophile who was spared jail after molesting a five-year-old girl went on to rape a child by posing as a babysitter on the internet.

Red Saunders, 23, raped a girl of eight and sexually assaulted another seven-year-old girl after tricking two families into believing he was a legitimate babysitter.

He was hired through Gumtree, a popular online classifieds noticeboard, after using his brother’s name to pose as a child minder.

'Hoodwinked': Using a false name, Saunders advertised his services as a babysitter on Gumtree despite being convicted of molesting a girl when he was 15. Social Services even raised fears over his 'disturbing and profound predatory interest in young girls'

The parents of the girls had no idea he 
had been banned from working with children in 2005 for molesting a 
five-year-old girl while working as a playgroup organiser at a gym.

'Your conduct amounts to every parent's nightmare'

Judge Peter Rook QC

When
 they asked Saunders to provide a document to show he had been vetted by
 the Criminal Records Bureau, he claimed it was ‘on its way’.

Following his arrest, police found a terrifying ‘abduction diary’ in 
which he described how to kidnap girls, abuse them, kill them and 
dispose of their bodies.

Officers also discovered more than 4,000 videos
 and pictures he had taken of children over the past two years.

So badly decomposed: Judge Gerald Gordon told Beddoe at Old Bailey (pictured) that because Mr Corey's body was found 11 days after his death, the cause of death could not be established causing 'further distress to the family... the concealment of a murder demands a significant sentence'

He was described as ‘every parent’s nightmare’ as he was jailed for life
 at the Old Bailey yesterday for a string of child abuse charges. He 
will serve a minimum of eight years before he is eligible for parole.

Cunning: : Judge Peter Rook QC told Saunders after sentencing him to life in prison, 'You inveigled yourself into the lives of decent families with great cunning'

Judge Peter Rook QC told him: ‘You are obsessed with young girls.

‘It is clear to me that you are an intelligent young man. You spurned 
your talents in order to plan carefully the systematic abuse of young 
girls who had been entrusted to your care.

'You have acted out your 
sexual fantasies without any thought as to the consequences of your 
actions. Your actions represent a massive breach of trust. Your conduct 
amounts to every parent’s nightmare.

‘You inveigled yourself into the lives of decent families with great 
cunning. You presented yourself as plausible, charming, someone who 
appeared to interact cheerfully and well with children.

‘It is quite clear your sexual offending is well entrenched. You have 
been downloading indecent images of children since you were 12. I am 
absolutely clear that you represented a high risk of serious harm to 
young girls.’

Saunders, an art and photography student at Wimbledon College of Art in 
South-West London, was banned from working with children for life and 
his name will be on the Sex Offenders Register for life.

In October 2011, Saunders abused a seven-year-old girl at her home, 
filming it using a camera on a tripod. In April 2012, he raped and 
sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl at her home on two consecutive
 days, which he also filmed.

He edited the footage and called the clips 
Paedo Productions and My Legacy.

Prosecutor Edward Lucas said: ‘In each case he provided an aide memoire 
for himself, setting out what he proposed to do to both girls under the 
guise of playing games. All of the details were a choreographed 
step-by-step guide to what he was going to do to both children.’

Saunders, from Redhill, Surrey, was placed under a supervision order at 
Guildford Crown Court in October 2005 after he admitted touching a five 
year-old girl during a game of hide and seek at a local gym. He was also
 added to the Sex Offenders Register for five years.
