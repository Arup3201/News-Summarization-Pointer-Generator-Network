It may look like something Tom Cruise would use in the hit film Minority Report, but the first laptop computer that can be controlled by the wave of a hand is set to go on sale next month.

The HP Envy 17 Leap Motion SE has a special sensor from San Francisco firm Leap Motion built into it, allowing it to track a user’s fingers as they move in front of the screen.

Although the Leap Motion sensor has been available as an add-on for computer, HP is the first firm to create a computer with it built in.

The small sensor, mounted below the keyboard, uses two cameras and three infrared LEDs to track the movement of any object - users can even hold a pencil, and the system is accurate enough to track fingers.

Leap Motion says it hopes the technology will one day find its way into smartphones and even head mounted displays.

'The Leap Motion team has developed incredible technology that fundamentally changes how consumers interact with digital content,' said Ron Coughlin, senior vice president of HP’s Consumer PC and Services group.

'We are excited to be the first to embed Leap Motion’s technology in a PC, and our collaboration with Leap Motion is just one example of how HP is innovating and defining the next generation computing experience.’

The Envy 17 Leap Motion SE also has a 17.3-inch display, and will cost $1095 when it goes on sale, although no UK price has yet been set.

To fit the gadget into a laptop, Leap Motion designed a new micro sensor that has a height of just 3.5 mm; smaller than any 3D motion control technology on the market.

‘HP integrating Leap Motion’s technology so rapidly pushes the industry forward to offer users more innovative computing options,’ said Michael Buckwald, co-founder and CEO of Leap Motion.

‘With our new micro sensor, there’s tremendous opportunity to integrate into other form factors like keyboards, smartphones, tablets, head-mounted displays and more.

‘This is the next step for our company, with tremendous potential for the future.’

The company launched its first product, the Leap Motion Controller, in July around the world.

Since then, the Airspace Store has grown to more than 100 titles and people have downloaded more than 1 million apps.

Users can play popular app games such as Fruit Ninja (pictured) on the laptop, using the built-in Leap Motion sensor to 'slice' fruit in mid air
