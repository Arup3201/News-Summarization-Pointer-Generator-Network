The influx of high-tech digital speed cameras has seen the the number of motorists trapped surge to 115,000 in the last year - the highest number since 2009.

Ministry of Justice figures show that a total of 115,549 motorists were fined at least £100 pounds by magistrates after being caught speeding.

The increase has been put down to the £10,000 digital cameras, that no longer require film and can operate 24 hours a day, the Telegraph reported.

South Wales has seen one of the biggest increases, with the number of people fined tripling last year to 6,491, from 2,181 three years earlier.

The number of offenders has also grown in that period by almost 1,000 in both South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, and by close to 2,000 in Staffordshire.

While London saw the most people fined last year, the figure for the Metropolitan Police area has fallen to 7,736 - its lowest level in five years.

Those convicted of a speeding offence must pay a minimum of £100 and will have three penalty points added to their licences. 

The total number of motorists caught speeding is believed to be far higher, as the figures only take into account those summoned to court for failure to pay fines and where speed was particularly excessive.

Hugh Bladon, one of the founding members of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'Speeding accounts for less than five per cent of accidents and only takes into account one aspect of how people are driving.

'They (speed cameras) do not measure whether the driver is under the influence of drink or drugs or how roadworthy their vehicle is. What about the other aspects?'  

The number of motorist caught speeding has reached its highest figure in four years

AA president Edmund King said the introduction of digital cameras mean the devices are now working all day long.

He told the Telegraph newspaper: 'It (the rise in speeding fines) is a reflection that cameras are more efficient than ever.

'In the past, cameras in London they would only take valid pictures for a quarter of day and it was pot luck whether you are fined. The cameras are now working 24 hours a day.'

Last week the Institution of Engineering and Technology said in the future the speed at which cars can travel may be altered to fit the driver's experience, and the development of driverless cars may mean an end to speeding.

'Within 15 years, we predict that the performance of cars could be altered to fit the driver,' the institution said.

'Speeding may become a thing of the past as cars are likely to be fitted with speed-limiting devices.'

This year this year a speed camera in Cardiff generated more than an estimated £800,000 worth of fines in just six months.

According to road safety group GoSafe Wales, the device on the junction of the city's Newport Road and Colchester Avenue caught 13,624 speeding motorists and a further 146 running red lights between January and June.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: 'Speeding can have devastating consequences and it's right that drivers should abide by the speed limit. These fines were issued at the discretion of the magistrates and show the number of fines issued is in decline across many police force areas.'
