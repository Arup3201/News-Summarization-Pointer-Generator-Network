The family of a murder victim is suing a funeral home and a cemetery after their relative's casket popped open during her burial.

Mother-of-five Nequia Webb-Davidson, 40, was shot and killed by her husband in a murder-suicide on January 12, 2014, just days after she filed an emergency protection order.

As her body was lowered into the grave later that month, the lid scraped against the side and swung open, sending a pile of soil and stones onto the corpse.

Grappling to recover the situation, cemetery employees started trying to dig around the plot to make it bigger - leaving the grieving relatives to look on in horror for hours.

Eventually, they announced the burial would have to be postponed for a day while they re-sized the hole and cleaned the casket's inner lining.

'Horrifying': Relatives of Nequia Webb-Davidson, who was shot dead by her husband in January 2014, were forced to watch cemetery workers try to force her casket into the ground as soil and rubble fell on her body

Far fewer relatives were able to attend the rescheduled service.  

In a lawsuit against J. Foster Phillips Funeral Home, Inc. in Jamaica, New York, and Rosehill Cemetery in Linden, New Jersey, the family accuses both firms of 'exacerbating' the tragedy of Webb-Davidson's death.

'It just was a horrifying sight,' Webb-Davidson's sister Kandice Webb told CBS2. 

'They tried to fix it, you know make the hole a little bigger and what they did was make a mess... we sat there for hours trying to bury her.

'No one should have to go through that.'

Brooklyn-born Webb-Davidson was killed at her family home in Virginia by her veteran husband Terrell Davidson, who served on four tours in Afghanistan and Iraq and reportedly suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

She left behind five children aged 13 to 21, and was described as 'compassionate' by her family.  

The suit, filed to Brooklyn Supreme Court on January 25, demands reimbursement for the casket, the burial and the funeral service.

The family also requests damages for grief and suffering and expenses for relatives who stayed an extra day for the rescheduled service.

The family attorney, Ron Katter, says the incident was evidence of incompetence and negligence for which both firms need to be held accountable.

'It was a desecration of the remains,' Katter told 1010 WINS.

'The funeral home showed an incredible amount of disrespect not only for the deceased, but for her family, who had to witness this incompetence and negligence.

'It is tragic enough that the family continues to feel the anguish of their sudden loss but, worse, they still have to experience the horrors that occurred that day at the graveside service.'

Representatives for the funeral home and the cemetery have yet to respond to Daily Mail Online's request for a comment.
