Serial philanderer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reported to have kept a list of dozens of women filed under the letter ‘G’ in his cell phone, including his soon-to-be-wife actress Cheryl Hines and Chelsea Kirwan, his alleged mistress who is currently involved in a bitter divorce battle.

Allegations about a cell phone full of women’s numbers, have emerged at a tricky time for the 60-year-old, twice-married, father-of-six.

Later this month he is set to marry Curb Your Enthusiasm star Hines, 48, in a ceremony expected to take place over the weekend of July 25, during the annual Kennedy family reunion in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.

RFK is also in the potentially embarrassing situation of being deposed on July 22 by lawyers for plastic surgeon Laurence Kirwan as part of his bitter divorce battle with his wife Chelsea.

Allegations recently surfaced that RFK had an affair with the 42-year-old mother-of-four for two years behind Hines’ back.

If all this wasn’t embarrassing enough for RFK and his bride-to-be, the New York Post has revealed that the environmental lawyer and activist had contact details for 43 suspected mistresses stored in his cell phone.

The Post reports that Kennedy’s late wife, Mary Richardson, told a friend about the list just two months before she committed suicide in May 2012.

She is understood to have believed he had stored the names under ‘G’ because of the Italian slang for mistress - ‘goomah’.

When RFK had contact details for several women with the same first name, he would distinguish them by listing either their profession or city.

His list included at least five women from Toronto and other in Paris, Palm Beach, Florida, and Aspen, Colorado.

The Post contacted several women on the list, some of whom confirmed that they had met Kennedy.

One described him as a ‘big flirt', while another described him as a ‘charming and talented man’, but denied that they had ever been romantically involved.

The exact nature of RFK’s relationship with Chelsea Kirwan could be revealed in court later this month when her husband will appeal to try and modify the protection order currently in place over his visitation rights for his three children with ex-wife.

A source told MailOnline; 'Chelsea has learned that Laurence's lawyers are serious about calling Bobby to court later this month. She fears they want to discredit her as a wife and a mom.’

This isn't the first time that details about RFK's serial philandering has emerged. A 2001 diary belonging to him surfaced last September which helped gave a stunning insight into the number of affairs he had carried out during the same year that wife Mary had given birth to their fourth child.

Kennedy used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a mark out of ten.

The list contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside them - which is believed to have signified that they had full intercourse.

Alongside more prosaic details of Kennedy’s political activism and family life, there are startling admissions of his own feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife.

The 48-year-old actress and 60-year-old environmental activist took part in Fourth Of July celebrations in the Hamptons area of New York and didn't try to hide their jewelry ahead of their wedding this month

Time and again he wrote of how he felt tortured by his ‘lust demons’ as he described them. 

On days when he didn’t cheat, Kennedy wrote ‘victory’ to signify that he had resisted sexual temptation.

‘I’m
 like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. 
But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on Nov. 5, 2001.

The thick, red journal was found at one stage by his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, who, distraught over their impending divorce and her husband's serial philandering, hanged herself in May 2012.

The diary later found its way into the hands of the New York Post. When a Post reporter questioned Kennedy about the diary they were first met with a stunned silence before he denied having kept a diary during that year.

‘I don’t think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001,’ said Kennedy. ‘I don’t have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.’

At the start of the journal the 59-year-old son of the assassinated U.S. senator announced that his wife was pregnant with their fourth child.

Kennedy, pictured at his wife Mary's graveside in 2012 with their children, wrote in his 2001 diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her

But soon Kennedy was writing about far seedier matters. He often wrote as if he was the victim of the incidents and uses the word ‘mugged’ as shorthand for being seduced.

‘I narrowly escaped being mugged by a double team of [two women]. It was tempting but I prayed and God gave me the strength to say no,’ he wrote on February 6, 2001.

On May 21, he wrote that after hosting dinner for Leonardo DiCaprio, he drove the actor into Manhattan and met up with someone. He noted that he ‘got mugged on my way home,’ recording a 10 with the name of a woman next to it.

‘I’ve got to do better,’ he added.

In another entry, he said he needed to ‘avoid the company of women. You have not the strength to resist their charms’ and to ‘be humble like a monk. Keep your hands to yourself. Avert your eyes.’

Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at Camp Garcia, the United States Navy training facility on the island of Vieques.

He wrote positively about his incarceration because it temporarily freed him from the desires of his raging libido.

‘I’m so content here,’ he wrote. ‘I have to say it. There’s no women. I’m happy! Everybody here seems happy. It’s not misogyny. It’s the opposite! I love them too much.’

On July 8, just days before son Aiden was born, he wrote lovingly about his wife: ‘I finally spoke to my wonderful wife and that was a joy. She is very strong and cheerful.’

‘I’m so proud of my Mary. She has become the woman I fell in love with - through hard work. She has overcome her fears, enshrined her faith, abandoned self-pity and blame and immersed herself in gratitude and God gave her a baby... a beautiful and serene and happy soul.

'I am so happy. I couldn’t be happier or more grateful for the life and the wife God has given me.’

He also found time to contemplate his own weaknesses and his feelings of insecurity in trying to live up the legacy of his father.

‘After daddy died I struggled to be a grown-up... I felt he was watching me from heaven. Every time I was afflicted with sexual thoughts, I felt a failure. I hated myself. I began to lie - to make up a character who was the hero and leader that I wished I was,’ he writes on July 25.

Near the end of his jail sentence he wrote of a ‘three-point plan’ for ‘fixing my greatest defect... my lust demons’ - but he never wrote with the plan was.

By mid-August, he is out of jail and once again women’s names started to appear in the back of his journal.

‘I have been given everything that I coveted - a beautiful wife and kids and loving family, wealth, education, good health and a job I love yet always on the lookout for something I can’t have. I want it all,’ he wrote.

‘No matter how much I have - I want more.’

November 2001 was an especially busy month for infidelities and he lists at least one woman’s name on 22 different dates, including on 13
 consecutive days.

Three dalliances even occurred on the same day - one is marked a ten - when he attended a black-tie fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria on Nov. 13 for Christopher Reeve’s charity.
