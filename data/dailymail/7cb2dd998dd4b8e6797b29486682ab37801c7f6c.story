George Best is still the bravest player I've seen... he changed football

Harry Redknapp is one of the game’s most colourful and outspoken characters. 

Here, in the latest extract from his fascinating book, he reveals the clamour for Kenny Dalglish's signature and charts the beginning of English football's influx of foreign talent.

Clearing out the garage the other day, I found a pair of my dad’s old boots. It’s a wonder players from the 50s could run at all! Metal toecaps, studs banged in the bottom with the nails coming through the sole.

How could you have had any feel for a football with a set of those on? I’d love to organise a game one day. Get 22 top players together, the stars of the Premier League, put them in the old equipment and see how they coped. Now that would be interesting.

In the Fifties, there were two kinds of surface, rock hard or mud heap. So it was unbelievable, really, to show the skill that the Tottenham team demonstrated in that gear.

Tottenham were superb in the Fifties, especially on the surface... I'd like to see Premier League players try!

Spurs were a 'push and run' team, I would compare them to the modern Barcelona 

They were the ‘push and run’ team. It is hard to explain their significance to a younger generation, but I would compare them to the modern Barcelona, the way their game was all about short passing and movement.

It wasn’t quite as sophisticated, obviously. What they called push and run back then is now known as the one-two and every team does it. But at the time it was revolutionary.

My dad, also called Harry, loved Arsenal, but football wasn’t as tribal then as it is now, so Highbury wasn’t our only destination.

Millwall’s ground, The Den, was another haunt, and coming from East London we would wait at the entrance of the Rotherhithe Tunnel for a lift across the river. 

Eventually a car would stop and we’d jump in. In those days, people were friendlier and more trusting. 

They were going to football, we were going to football, so we all went together. 

Highbury and The Den (pictured) were the normal grounds for me as a youngster

An Arsenal vs Manchester United programme, 1958 - the Busby Babes last ever game

Few people wore colours in those days. I remember my mum knitted me a red and white scarf for when I went to Arsenal, but there were no replica shirts or club merchandise. 

My dad even used to put on a collar and tie to go to some games.

I saw the last game the Busby Babes played in this country, a 5–4 win at Arsenal on February 1, 1958, and that would have stuck in my mind even without Munich. It was a fantastic game, such incredible quality, and the next I heard was a radio bulletin saying Manchester United’s plane had crashed on the way back from Belgrade. 

Mum always had the radio on: The Billy Cotton Band Show, The Archers and the news, and that’s where I heard about Manchester United and Duncan Edwards.

I’d kept a scrapbook and I’m sure there is a picture from a newspaper in it of Duncan sitting up in his hospital bed: he was going to be all right. Sadly, his condition worsened and he died. I was devastated. He was my idol.

By the time I was 11, I was being scouted by professional clubs, so we used to get offered a lot of tickets. Then we could take our pick of matches. 

Top of the pile for my dad was when Tom Finney was in town, playing for Preston. In one game Tom played for England, Portugal captain Alvaro Cardoso walked off the field and demanded to be replaced because he was so tired of being given the run-around. England won 10–0.

Where are poor Paul Gascoigne's friends now he needs their help?

Dalglish had West Ham stars standing and applauding at 15... then he signed for Celtic!

Alan Hansen reminded me of Bobby Moore, that's why he's in my team of the Eighties 

John Robertson, Kevin Keegan and Phil Neal make my team of the Seventies 

Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing 

Wenger heralded a change... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports to England

Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent 

Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while on TV!

The England and Manchester United man died along with many team-mates in the Munich air disaster, 1958

Another stand-out player was goalkeeper Bert Trautmann, who perhaps is the best example of how the game has changed.

He was the first foreign star in English football, who came here as a German prisoner of war, and stayed. I’m not sure that could happen now. I think it would be too horrible for him.

He’d been a member of the Hitler youth, a Luftwaffe paratrooper, and had fought on the Eastern front in Russia. He was captured and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Lancashire, and when the war was over he ended up playing for St Helens Town in the Lancashire Combination.

When Frank Swift, who was Manchester City’s goalkeeper, contracted TB and they went in for Trautmann, there were huge protests at first, particularly among the Jewish community, until the chief rabbi of Manchester came out in his defence.

Bert Trautmann was another stand-out player, and is a great example of how the game has changed

He came to England as a German prisoner of war, soon after he won the Footballer of the Year award

He was exotic, he was different. The media wasn’t as sensationalist back then, but we all knew his background, all knew whose side he was on in the war.

I suppose it is testament to what he was like as a player and a person that he won over the crowds. In 1956 he was the first foreign player to win the Footballer of the Year Award — it was the year he won the FA Cup, playing with a broken neck.

I just look at where he came from and think: ‘If we all ended up liking a bloke who had fought for the Nazis, he must have been good.’
