Springwatch star Michaela Strachan was hailed as inspirational yesterday for speaking about the trauma of undergoing a double mastectomy

Springwatch star Michaela Strachan was hailed as inspirational yesterday for speaking about the trauma of undergoing a double mastectomy.

The Springwatch star was told that she had breast cancer following a routine mammogram in February this year.

Yesterday she spoke publicly for the first time about her diagnosis and treatment and the prospect she now faces of having reconstructive surgery.

In an emotional interview Ms Strachan, 48, told how she now feels she has a job to do in encouraging other women to make sure they attend regular screenings to check for the disease.

Surgeons advised her to opt for a double mastectomy, the same procedure that Angelina Jolie also underwent last year, as there was a significant risk that her lobular cancer, which began in a gland that makes milk, might spreading from one breast to the other.

Yesterday she used Twitter to publicise the story and to announce that has taken up the role of ambassador for a leading breast cancer charity.

She wrote: ‘Today I become an ambassador for @BreakthroughBC to encourage women to have regular mammograms.

‘This year has been a challenging one. In Feb I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I was lucky, I found it early.’

The response from those reading her story was immediate and almost universal and she was inundated with messages of support and appreciation of her bravery.

Chris Askew, Chief Executive at Breakthrough Breast Cancer led the way saying he believed she would ‘inspire and unit people’ facing the disease.

He said: ‘We are honoured to welcome Michaela on board as a Breakthrough Breast Cancer ambassador.

Michaela has been so brave in coming forward to share this authentic and inspiring account of her breast cancer journey.

‘By sharing her story, Michaela is raising awareness of the devastation that breast cancer causes to families from every walk of life.

‘Michaela is so well-loved by the public, and we hope she will inspire and unite people to support Breakthrough, and take us closer to the day we are able to stop breast cancer for good.’

Kate Macrae, a wildlife photographer who has worked on Springwatch, described Michaela as ‘a truly inspirational, strong and wonderful woman.’

On Twitter fans of her many shows were quick to commend her bravery and the awareness her story will bring.

Sarah Robinson said: ‘So glad you have made full recovery. Well done on raising awareness on this vile disease.’

Sarah-Jane Phillips, from Bedfordshire, added: ‘Such an all too familiar story and a really brave lady for sharing her story as it really does encourage others.’

While Susan Brewer, from Essex, said: ‘What a brave lady Michaela Strachan is. Fighting breast cancer, having the guts to tell her story. Inspirational.’

But it was clear the decision to go public was not one that Ms Strachan took lightly, writing yesterday in the Mail on Sunday she spoke of how she agonised about whether she should speak out about her illness.

She wrote: ‘I decided to make my story public and become an ambassador for Breakthrough Breast Cancer, a cutting-edge research charity working to stop breast cancer for good, in the hope that I can be an inspiration to other women who find themselves at the start of this frightening journey.

The TV presenter, pictured with son Ollie, right, said: 'I thought hard about telling my story, because I don’t want to be labelled'

‘I can remind them about the importance of having regular mammograms.

‘If I’d put mine off, my story could have been a very different one. As it is, I’ve had a tough year and an emotional journey, but I’m not fighting for my life.

‘I thought hard about telling my story, because I don’t want to be labelled. For years I’ve carried the label ‘ex-anorexic’; no doubt that will now change to ‘breast cancer patient’.

‘But we all have challenges to face in our lives. We all have curve balls thrown at us.’

The public benefit of celebrities sharing their health scares, especially with regards to cancer has a well proven track record.

Last year Angelina Jolie revealed she had chosen to undergo a double mastectomy after testing positive for a gene mutation that increases the risk of developing breast cancer by 87 per cent.

The result was dubbed the ‘Angelina Jolie effect’ and saw rates of NHS referrals for the same tests double as women rushed to take the same precautions.
