She’s been dazzling male viewers with her array of bikinis and generous curves - but it seems not everyone is impressed by her shower scenes, as it is reported that I’m A Celebrity star Helen Flanagan has been named as the nation’s biggest HD horror.

The former Coronation Street actress topped the poll of famous faces who look worse in HD than they do in standard definition.

Former prima ballerina and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell was the second biggest HD disappointment, closely followed by X Factor judge Tulisa and fashion maven Victoria Beckham.

Although her shower scenes on I'm A Celebrity may have impressed, Helen Flanagan was voted the celebrity who looks worst in high definition

Simon Cowell, Adrian Chiles and Jeremy Clarkson were the male celebrities who viewers said look even worse in HD than they do in standard definition.

But some celebs were judged to look even better in high definition with Holly Willoughby, Kate Middleton and Tess Daly topping the list of HD heroines.

Olympic gymnast turned Strictly Come Dancing star Louis Smith and all of One Direction were named as the male celebrities who looked best in HD.

One survey respondent said: 'Helen Flanagan has an amazing figure but HD does her skin no favours. I suppose there’s no way to hide behind make up when you’re in the middle of the jungle.'

Another voter said: 'I love Strictly Come Dancing and Darcey Bussell has added a new credibility to the show but viewed on BBC1HD she looks ten years older than on BBC1. The HD pictures can be cruel.'

Tulisa Contostavlos and Simon Cowell were also classed as 'HD horrors'

A male respondent added: 'For me Holly Willoughby is the celeb who looks even better in HD than she does in SD – and that is saying something.'

A female X Factor fan who took part in the survey said: 'Tulisa was voted the most beautiful woman in the world last year but see her in HD and she ain’t all that. She’s covered in moles which don’t show up in SD.'

Another female voter said: 'Simon Cowell looks like he’s overdone the Botox to me. Seen in HD the full horror is there for all to see. He’s like Frankenstein’s slightly younger brother.'

Holly Willoughby and the Duchess of Cambridge were voted as the HD delights by TV fans

Organisers HDTVTest.co.uk stressed that the survey wasn’t a poll on attractiveness but was designed to highlight which famous names delight or disappoint when viewed in high definition.

A spokesman said: 'Often it’s things like skin tones which are most dramatically revealed. While famous faces often insist on being airbrushed for magazine photo shoots there really is no place to hide from a high definition television camera.

'So we thought it would be interesting to ask our users which celebs they thought looked even better in HD over SD and which looked worse.'
