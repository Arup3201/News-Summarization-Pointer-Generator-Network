A nine-year-old boy born with a rare syndrome that gives him obsessive tendencies has become devoted to a collection of Henry vacuum cleaners.

Lane Fountain has Williams Syndrome, a condition which causes him to have a very sociable and trusting nature, and which means he is acutely sensitive to the needs of others.

It has also led to him developing an obsession with vacuum cleaners.

Williams syndrome is a genetic condition that is present from birth.

People with the condition tend to have elfin features.

It is characterised by medical problems including cardiovascular diease, development delays and learning disabilities.

These symptoms occur alongside impressive verbal abilities, highly sociable personalities and an affinity for music.

Other common features include feeding problems, dental abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, hernias and attention deficit disorder.

It affects one in every 10,000 people and occurs equally often in men and women.

Lane currently has a collection of 17 hoovers and is constantly offering to clean his parent's home.

His favourite activity is visiting vacuum shops – he will happily play with them all day.

Lane’s father, Mark Fountain, 34, said:  ‘People with Williams Syndrome tend to obsess about things and in Lane's case, it is hoovers. He's adored them from a young age.

‘When we go shopping for the day his little reward for being good will be going into a shop where he can play with the hoovers for 15 minutes.

‘It's like watching an old man looking at a classic car. He studies every little detail, he knows all the different models, makes and product numbers.

‘His room is full of hoovers and he's got more in the garden. I think there's more to come because he's gravitating toward carpet washers.

‘The funny thing is he's not actually much good at hoovering. He tends to do the same spot over and over again and gets distracted by looking at himself in the mirror.’

Lane, from Rayleigh in Essex, added: ‘I love cleaning and I do it every day. I love most hoovers and carpet cleaners - especially Henry, he's my favourite.’

Williams Syndrome is a genetic condition that is present at birth and can affect anyone. 

It is characterised by medical problems, including cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and learning disabilities. 

Lane's parents say that he is now gravitating towards carpet cleaners and that they believe this will be his next obsession

These occur side by side with striking verbal abilities, highly social personalities and an affinity for music.

It affects 1 in 10,000 people worldwide and is known to occur equally in both males and females and in every culture.

Lane, who lives with Mr Fountain, his mother Danny Wolstenholme, 40, and his seven-year-old sister, Lacey, requires constant care as a result of his condition.

Mr Fountain, a professional photographer, said: ‘As obsessions go, hoovering is obviously quite a good one to have and at least he's keeping out of mischief.

‘But there is a serious side to Lane's condition. Youngsters with Williams Syndrome don't have a bad bone in their body.

‘Their sole purpose it to make people happy so he's always the centre of attention making people smile and laugh.

Lane was born with Williams syndrome which is a genetic condition that affects 1 in 10,000 people

He has been collecting vacuum cleaners throughout his childhood

‘But at the same time there is no awareness whatsoever of strangers or danger. Everybody is their friend and they cannot see the bad in people.

‘Obviously there are people out there who will take advantage of the over-friendliness - and as a parent that's our biggest worry.

‘But we wouldn't have Lane any other way. He loves everyone, regardless of race, creed or colour and that makes him totally unique.’

Lane recently appeared on Channel 4 show, The Hotel, where a cleaner from the Grosvenor Hotel in Torquay, Devon, taught him how to hoover a room.

As a special treat staff invited him back over the weekend to help them choose from a range of new hoovers.

Sandra Morris, head of housekeeping, said: ‘We chose Lane to test the models as there's no better man for the job.’
