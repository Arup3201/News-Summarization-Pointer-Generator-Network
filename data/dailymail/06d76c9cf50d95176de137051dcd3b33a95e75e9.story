China's ban on BBC show Sherlock hasn't stopped it becoming a huge hit on the internet, it was reported today.

The show was among dozens of Western programmes banned by censors in a crackdown aimed at sexual content.

But despite not appearing on the Chinese Central ­Television network or other major channels, 69 million viewers have still seen it on video websites.

Big hit in China: Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes in the hit BBC show Sherlock, which was banned by censors in a crackdown aimed at sexual content

A source in China told the Sunday Mirror: 'Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s older brother, is a dodgy government official and that’s probably too close to home for the Communist Party of China.

'Chinese dramas are dull compared to UK ones. That’s why they’re so popular and people watch them over the internet.'

The show starring  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman is in its third series and attracted 9.18 million people when the first episode episode aired in January.

Earlier this month UK TV bosses flew to China to discuss the ­distribution of other British shows.

Broadcasters in China have had strict regulations about showing Western content, but until recently the rules were not as strict for online streaming sites.

However, in January, SAPPRFT issued new rules requiring video-sharing sites to censor some content and end the posting of short videos under pseudonyms, the South China Morning Post reported.

Among them, local web giant Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) is facing the threat of its video and ebook portals being shut down.

The Big Bang Theory, The Good Wife, Karl ­Pilkington’s An Idiot Abroad, NCIS and The Practice have all been removed from sites including Youku.com and letv.com.

Yet other shows including The Walking Dead and House of Cards have been allowed to be broadcast and been viewed millions of times.

BBC Two’s historical drama Peaky Blinders, BBC One’s The White Queen and E4's comedy drama Misfits, are also all web hits.

Shows based on UK programmes which are not banned are also popular.

The Chinese version of ITV’s The X Factor pulled in 112million viewers and 105million tuned in to watch a Chinese version of BBC1's The Voice.
