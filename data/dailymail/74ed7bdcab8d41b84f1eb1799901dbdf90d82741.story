A Christian school which claims it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies has urged the government to revise controversial ‘British values’ rules.

Trinity Christian School has been told by Ofsted it is not adequately meeting the ‘spiritual, moral, social and cultural development’ of pupils.

This is because it is not ‘actively’ promoting other faiths in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal in Birmingham, by asking different religious representatives to lead lessons and assemblies.

John Charles, chairman of governors at the small, co-educational independent school in Reading, has now written to Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, appealing for the new regulations to be reviewed.

He claims that the school’s aims are being undermined and it will be prevented in future from ‘teaching in accordance with our Christian foundation’.

The school is backed by the national religious liberty charity, the Christian Institute.

It has already warned that the new rules intended to combat extremism are having ‘disturbing consequences’ for religious schools and forcing Ofsted inspectors to act in a way which undermines their ethos.

In November, Ofsted inspectors described the school’s provision for pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development as ‘excellent’.

They said pupils were ‘well prepared for life in modern, multicultural, democratic British society through the teaching of the Christian principle to 'love thy neighbour'’.

This summer, the school, which has fees of £11,880-a-year, applied to the Department for Education to extend its age range to include pupils from nine to 11. As a result, it was re-inspected by Ofsted in October.

In his letter, Mr Charles claimed the inspection focused predominantly on revised Independent School Standards regarding spiritual, moral, social and cultural development.

This included whether the school could demonstrate evidence of actively promoting ‘the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs’.

He said: ‘We understand that the revised standards only came into force on 29 September and are held out as the Government’s response to radicalism and extremism.’

This issue ‘dominated’ the inspector’s questions and ‘at no point were any questions asked about other aspects of the curriculum or the quality of teaching assessed through lesson observations’.

Mr Charles continued: ‘In expressing doubt over the school’s continued existence, the inspector stated: that representatives of other faiths should be invited to lead assemblies and lessons in order for the school to demonstrate compliance with the Standards.’

The school was also told, that in order to comply with the new regulations, it should ‘actively’ promote other faiths, and the principles of the Equality Act 2010. This meant not stating ‘certain lifestyles are wrong’ or promoting a ‘particular lifestyle’.

Mr Charles said: ‘From November 2013 to October 2014 the school has continued the same provision for pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development which Ofsted adjudged excellent in November 2013.

‘Yet, immediately following the introduction of the revised school standards, the school is threatened with the prospect of closure. We cannot understand how such a change in thinking can take place within a year.

‘It is an explicit aim of ours to encourage pupils to serve and respect other people, appreciate different cultures and ideas and equip them for life in society.

‘But the comments made by Ofsted, as a result of the new regulations, undermine our aims and would prevent us from teaching in accordance with our Christian foundation.’

Mr Charles added: ‘We are therefore extremely concerned about where the new school standards leave the protections afforded by the Equality Act and our school’s charitable objects as established in the deed trust.’

The school, which aims to ‘provide each pupil with a Biblical understanding’ has received an ‘advice note’ from Ofsted, confirming it ‘does not meet the new requirements’.

But Simon Calvert, deputy director of The Christian Institute, said the law ‘has long respected the ability of religious schools to prioritise the teaching of their own faith’.

He said: ‘In this case, a Christian school, with Christian teachers and a Christian ethos - paid for by Christian parents - is being told they should have other religious leaders come in and lead collective worship.

‘Many Christian families would simply not want to subject their children to that.’

He added ‘What we need, is to go back to the drawing board to actually talk to stakeholders, talk to faith schools, find out where they’re coming from and come up with a set of proposals which don’t require them to promote beliefs which profoundly go against their own.’

In June, the government launched a consultation on proposed new Independent School Standards.

This stated that schools ‘most actively promote’ fundamental British values, ‘including furthering tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions and encouraging respect for democracy.

It added: ‘A minimum approach, for example putting up posters on a notice board and organising an occasional visit to places of worship would fall short of ‘actively promoting’.

‘Schools will be expected to focus on, and be able to show how their work with pupils is effective in embedding fundamental British values.’

An Ofsted spokeswoman said last night: ‘The independent school standards are set by the Department for Education.

‘Inspectors must check that independent schools follow these. The standards have been strengthened since this school was previously inspected in November 2013.

‘One of Her Majesty’s Inspectors to visited the school at the request of the Department for Education and found it had further work to do to prepare pupils for life in modern Britain.

‘Ofsted did not threaten the school with closure and has no powers to close schools.’

‘If the school is concerned about the conduct of an inspector or that an inspection is faulty, it should follow Ofsted's formal machinery for raising those concerns. The department will consider the Ofsted report when we receive it.’
