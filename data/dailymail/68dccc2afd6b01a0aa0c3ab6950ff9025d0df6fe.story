Supermarket giant Tesco has been slammed by customers and animal charities over an advert which appears to condone getting a puppy for Christmas.

An image in the shop's glossy festive gift guide features a child dashing past a blackboard with a scrawled message reading: 'All I want for Christmas is a puppy'.

The supermarket's Facebook page has been bombarded with complaints from hundreds of appalled shoppers - with many saying they have have abandoned the store over the ad.

Controversy: Tesco's festive gift brochure has sparked complaints over a photograph which apparently encourages shoppers to put a puppy on their Christmas list

Customer service workers at Tesco have been fielding complaints from dog lovers, as charity the Dogs Trust - which coined the iconic slogan 'A Dog is for Life, Not Just for Christmas' 35 years ago - waded into the row.

A spokesman from the charity said: 'Dogs Trust is incredibly disappointed to see the latest Tesco Magazine which shows a background image of a blackboard with the words "All I want for Christmas is a puppy".

'The charity's iconic slogan is 35 years old this Christmas but is sadly still as relevant today.

'We know many children would put a pup on
their Xmas list so we spend a considerable amount of time, money and 
effort reminding parents about the commitment and responsibility owning a
dog entails.'

Boycott: Some shoppers said they had abandoned the store over the image which features a child with a blackboard message reading 'All I want for Christmas is a puppy'

The RSPCA added: 'We would remind any parents wanting to get any animal as a present that pets are a lifelong commitment and would need a responsible adult to care for him or her.

'Careful consideration would be needed to ensure the animal would be loved for life and not just a short-term novelty.'

One customer Lesley Waugh wrote on Facebook: 'I'm no longer a Tesco shopper after seeing their ad. Substantial donations to small rescues will get my custom back.'

Lou Benney added: 'Tesco, why an earth did you think it was a good idea to advertise getting a puppy for xmas?

'A dog is for life, and rescues are full of dogs needing their forever homes, and no doubt that some of these poor dogs were once someone's xmas puppy.'

Another Facebook user, Clive Rowley, described the promo picture was 'sickening'.

He wrote: 'Tesco's current drive to incite children to ask for "a puppy for christmas" is just sickening.

'Uninformed people will buy a puppy, many of which will end up being put to sleep once the excitement of having a puppy wears off.'

Charlotte Sankey said that the advert jeopardised the hard work of animal charities.

She wrote: 'Animal charity's have been working hard for years to get the message across a dog is for life not just for Christmas.

'Rescue homes are overrun with unwanted dogs as it is and in January will be with the extra puppies that have been bought as presents at Christmas.

'Thousands of dogs are put to sleep each year because homes can't be found.

'I think you are thoughtless and irresponsible and need to rethink your advert. I will now be shopping elsewhere.'

The image appears on page 36 of the new Tesco Gift Guide which is available now in stores.

Not just for Christmas: Charity Dogs Trust, which coined the 'A Dog is For Life' slogan said it was 'disappointed' with the supermarket

It depicts a family home, decorated for Christmas, with a blackboard in the background containing the offending message.

A spokeswoman from Tesco apologised for the magazine and said that it was not supposed to encourage people to buy pets from Christmas.

She said: 'We're sorry that some people have taken offence at a picture in our magazine.

'It was not our intention to encourage people to buy dogs for Christmas.'
