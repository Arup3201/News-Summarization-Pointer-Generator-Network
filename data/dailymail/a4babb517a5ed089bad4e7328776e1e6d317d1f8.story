A drone has taken incredible photographs of Brighton's piers and parks capturing the seaside town as you've never seen it before. 

The images were taken by photographer Eddie Mitchell, from Worthing, Sussex, who has spent £10,000 on four drones as well training to be a drone pilot. 

Mr Mitchell, who has been a professional photographer for 15 years, had to seek permission first before allowing the drone to take to the skies this morning.

Among some of the landmarks captured from about 300ft in the sky were Brighton's Marine Palace and Pier and Brighton Pavilion.

Mr Mitchell had to spend six months training before qualifying as a drone pilot with the Civil Aviation Authority.

When the device is up in the air he can see the images taken on a Go-Pro camera through a screen while he stands on the ground.

According to Mr Mitchell, the drone is always within his sight.

Despite being a fully qualified drone pilot, there is always the weather, a bird strike or power failure to take into consideration when operating the drone.

Mr Mitchell said: 'Safety is the most important concern for me when the drone is up in the air.

'From the moment it is up I have to make sure I am working in a controlled environment.

'For the shots across Brighton this morning I had to seek permission to take the photographs over the pier when it was closed and no-one was on it.

'They are kind of edgy I think. Seeing landmarks from another angle.

'Sometimes they can make a building look better, sometimes they can make a building look worse.

I like to take shots at different angles and play with the light and shadows. But safety is always my number one priority.'
