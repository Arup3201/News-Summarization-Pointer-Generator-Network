The England squad took almost twice the time that was originally envisaged in travelling to their first day of training in Rio de Janeiro.

When the FA elected to twin the Urca military fort training camp with their Royal Tulip hotel base in San Conrado 12 kilometres away, their optimistic officials were confident the journey would take 20 minutes with the police escort laid on for all teams in the competition.

But such is the traffic chaos that the trip, even with the outriders ensuring priority through a logjam tunnel on route, took 39 minutes.

Delay: England's commute to their training base from their hotel took twice as long as the FA had expected

Security: The FA had hoped that the military escort would speed up their journey to training

The FA were relaxed as they had received a transport update briefing the night before that increased the estimated time to between 30 and 40 minutes and the England bus had kept within that time frame, albeit by one minute. 

And the players enjoyed the super scenic route via Ipanema and Copacabana beaches.

The England party will only be concerned about the journey time if the trip takes over 40 minutes on a regular basis. But it doesn’t help that traffic starts building up on the main road outside the team hotel from 5.30 every morning.

Scenic: England train for the first time at their base overlooking Sugar Loaf Mountain

The UEFA delegates who meet as a group ahead of the FIFA Congress are expected to have the organisation’s dysfunctional governance under president Sepp Blatter at the top of their agenda. And the slippery Blatter doesn’t look as though he can win on 2022 Qatar vote corruption whatever findings investigator Michael Garcia delivers next month. If Garcia calls for a revote, Blatter’s FIFA presidency would be untenable, while any whitewash also makes a mockery of FIFA...........................................................................

FA chairman Greg Dyke may have made that infamous cut-throat gesture about England’s chances in Brazil after the World Cup draw. But Dyke, who has been criticised for trying to fit his FA duties around his many other business interests, is nevertheless expected to be at the tournament for most of England’s stay, starting with the FIFA Congress today before flying to Manaus for the Italy game. FA vice-president David Gill is also travelling from the Congress to the Amazon city to watch England, although he is not part of the official FA delegation.

It looks as though the FA made a wise decision in moving from the Windsor Atlantica hotel on Copacabana Beach to the more secluded Royal Tulip. A huge fans’ area, complete with giant screens and beer tents, is being constructed directly outside the Windsor, where hundreds of thousands of fans are expected to watch the games.

All mod cons for Roy

England are certainly World Cup contenders when it comes to the detailed preparation for the squad’s stay in Brazil.

Roy Hodgson’s players arrived in Rio on Sunday to find all their leisure areas, including a games room with table tennis and pool tables, had been fitted out by FA staff in the 24 hours since the rooms were handed over.

The training ground pitch at the Urca military fort, prepared by Yorkshire-based Sports Turf Research Institute, also bears no resemblance to the divot-strewn bumpy surface seen there last December, although it still cuts up quickly.

And certainly no other federation would have spent so much time and effort preparing such lavish media facilities inside one of the fort buildings. The cost is understood to be around £80,000, of which team sponsors Vauxhall have paid £30,000 for their branding.

However, despite such a welcoming environment, FA spin-doctors stopped players talking about Italy.

Home from home: England's hotel in Rio was all kitted out for their arrival from Miami

World Cup favourites Brazil wanted English-based security firm Hans Global to guard the team during the tournament before it was insisted at high Government level that Brazilians should do the job. HG, who look after St George’s Park and also sent a group to bolster security around the England team in Miami, provide that service for the Brazil side on their world tours of friendly matches in the World Cup build-up. And HG were in line to carry on their guard duty for the hosts until the politicians intervened.
