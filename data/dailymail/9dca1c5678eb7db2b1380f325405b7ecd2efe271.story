Double standards? UN representative Raquel Rolnik stayed in a £300-a-night hotel despite her earlier concerns for those struggling with the 'bedroom tax'

The United Nations official who condemned Britain’s housing policy chose only the best UK accommodation for herself, it has emerged.

Raquel Rolnik stayed at a four-star hotel where the cheapest room costs £300 a night while preparing a report claiming the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ meant people were going hungry to pay their rent.

The UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing was put up in the Rubens at the Palace Hotel in the shadow of Buckingham Palace, where diners can spend thousands on a single bottle of wine.

She shunned hotels far closer to the UN offices she used, which had rooms for less than half the price.

Mrs Rolnik’s 12-day mission was paid for by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which is supported by British taxes. Around £22million of the foreign aid budget has gone to the organisation in the past six years.

Tory MPs labelled Mrs Rolnik an ‘international trougher’ and called for a rethink after cash intended for the world’s poorest was used to support attacks on British policy.

Clacton MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘People like this come with an agenda and never seem to be able to see that they are hypocrites.’

Mrs Rolnik’s report demanded abolition of the ‘bedroom tax’ – a housing benefit curb for those with extra rooms who claim a spare room subsidy.

It criticised the Government for encouraging home ownership and called for rent controls, security for renters, and new social housing.

Mrs Rolnik said she met ‘many people who are increasingly having to choose between food and paying the penalty’, grandmothers forced from homes and single parents with no space for their children.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith called Sao Paulo-born Mrs Rolnik ‘a loopy Brazilian Leftie’ and said ‘her actions undermine the impartiality of the UN’.

The trip was made on Mrs Rolnik’s own initiative and accepted by the Government as a matter of protocol. She spent several nights, two this week, at the Rubens, which is one of Britain’s top 40 hotels.

It is popular with senior police officers and often hosts functions that attract royal appearances.

While Mrs Rolnik wrote about housing benefit claimants who  go without food, she could enjoy a  restaurant whose signature dish, Dover sole with potatoes and chive lemon butter, costs £35. A white burgundy can set a diner back more than £100, while a fine claret,  Chateau Petrus 2000, costs £2,460.

The rules of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights say its budget ‘allows for two country visits for each expert’ per year. A spokesman in London confirmed the UN paid for Mrs Rolnik’s visit.

The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is run on voluntary donations from UN countries. Its latest financial report says it is ‘stretched to breaking point’.

The Department for International Development plans to continue  giving £2.5million a year to the Geneva-based UN agency in the wake of a review that said it had ‘a critical role in meeting international and UK development objectives’ – but ‘a number of reforms needed to take place to further strengthen the organisation’. A second review is set for this year.

The spending comes from the  foreign aid budget, which will grow to more than £11billion in 2015. Critics say the Prime Minister has upped spending to try to soften the Tories’ ‘nasty party’ reputation.

Mr Carswell said: ‘The aid budget is a way in which poor people in Britain pay for the lifestyles of rich people in developing countries.

‘We are having to pay taxes to put this international trougher up in a four-star hotel. People like Mrs  Rolnik never seem to grasp that we have elections so people can decide these matters for themselves.’
