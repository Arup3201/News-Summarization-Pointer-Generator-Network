Mitt Romney came on the Today Show this morning to weigh in on the security threats facing the Winter Olympics but added his two cents about the prospect of a Republican beating the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, should she decide to run.

Asked by Savannah Guthrie on Today whether or not Mrs Clinton is beatable, Romney said: ‘I'm sure she is, because people recognize the country is just not doing what it needs to be doing’.

He vehemently denied that he would ever run again after his failed 2012 bit, and then gave off a quick list of possible GOP contenders.

Speaking of the past: Mitt Romney was in charge of the Salt Lake City Olympic Games in Utah in 2002, just months after the September 11 terrorist attacks, and said Russia seems to be handling security threats well

‘This is a time for Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Jeb Bush, Mike Pence, John Kasich- a long list- Marco Rubio. There are a lot of folks who should have the chance to be our nominee and I'm going to support the one who gets the prize,’ he said.

Romney’s visit to the New York City set came in conjunction with the mounting security fears for the winter Olympics that begin in a few short weeks in Russia near the Black Sea.

The former Masssachusetts Governor was in charge of the 2002 Winter Games which presented their own set of security challenges given that they were held just months after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

In spite of the disapproval he touted against Russia throughout the 2012 campaign, Romney was very complimentary of the Russian government’s efforts to secure the site and did his best to reassure any anxious viewers, saying he would 'absolutely' bring his family to the Games.

‘There's never been a Games that I know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you're seeing at Sochi. At the same time, the level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level,’ Romney said.

‘I believe the Games will be safe. That doesn’t mean there’s a 100 per cent guarantee anywhere in the world today. But this is, after all, a dangerous corner of the world.

Changing tune: In spite of his harsh rhetoric against Russia during the 2012 campaign, Romney said that they were taking ever possible precaution in the lead up to the Sochi Games

‘The specific threats that have been leveled suggest that this is an area that could be targeted and therefore there's a degree of risk associated with, well frankly life today in a world where terrorism exists.’

Romney said that while the warnings about the Black Widow terrorists and other specific women that appear to pose a threat to the safety of the Games may come as shocking and scary to some, he sees them as examples of the efficiency of the organizers.

New priorities: Rather than running again, Romney said he is happy to have the extra time with his sons and family

‘Extraordinary intelligence work- that's what happened with our Games that gave me confidence that they'd be safe,’ he said.

‘Now and then we'll hear reports of an individual they're looking for- that suggests they have pretty good intelligence so all in all, it seems to be a very effective security program, but again, no 100 per cent guarantee.’

One point that he parsed out was that he has a high level of confidence of the security at the ‘hard sites’ where the physical events will take place, keeping the athletes and spectators safe during the tournaments, but soft sites will remain an issue- just as they do throughout the world- because there is no way for security officials to check everyone in public areas.

‘Terrorists can move almost wherever they want to go. It only takes one person to go through a sieve of some kind and so a place like Sochi can be surrounded if you will,’ Romney said.

‘I think that people can recognize that the hard sites and the athletes will be safe and spectators when they're in the venues will be safe but it’s the soft places that you can’t be 100 per cent certain will be entirely safe, but my guess is that Russians have done everything humanly possible to protect the Games.’

He maintained that while he still views Russia as a ‘geopolitical adversary’ of the United States and the world since ‘their friends are some of the world's worst actors’ that is not justification enough to keep the Games away from the country.

‘I don’t think you hold off particular countries based upon their politics,’ he said.

He did wade into the so-called Bridge-gate scandal that is gripping American domestic politics, however, taking a firm line of support for his 'close friend' Chris Christie.

Romney's camp considered the New Jersey Governor as a possible vice presidential candidate and selected Christie to give the coveted keynote speech at the Republican National Convention and ended up selecting Wisconsin Senator Paul Ryan instead.

He reaffirmed his statement that there are no hard feelings between the two and that he believes that Christie has handled the multiple scandals facing him as he gets off to a rocky start in his second term.

'I've been in touch with Chris and frankly what I think we've seen is a strong leader who took responsibility, he fired people who were responsible for the scandal and he has moved on as a leader and I do believe the American people want to see a strong leader in the White House and he is,' Romney said.

The interview this morning also coincided with the release of a documentary about his presidential campaign, appropriately titled 'Mitt', on Netflix today.

The filmmaker, Greg Whiteley, followed Romney and his family for six years as part of the making of the film, and though he was overall pleased with the final product, Romney said he was surprised by the fact that more personal moments between he and his wife and the family prayer sessions were included.

'There were some scenes I kinda wish he wouldn't have included. There are couple scenes where we're praying for instance and I knew he was in the room but I didn't think he was actually filming during our prayer,' he said.

'Gosh darn it he captured all that and then he had the chutzpah to actually use it!'

'Most of it's kind of fun as I watch my sons and my grandchildren and daughters-in-law interacting and supporting a guy who was under the microscope.'
