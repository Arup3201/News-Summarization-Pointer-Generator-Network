Apology: Michael Buerk has said sorry after he criticised Ched Evans' rape victim for being drunk

Michael Buerk admitted today he was 'clumsy' to argue Ched Evans' rape victim did not come out 'with any credit' as she had 'drunk so much she could barely stand'. 

The BBC veteran, 68,  sparked outrage, with one group saying his comments were 'deeply offensive' to women who had suffered sexual violence.

Mr Buerk's remarks were made in a live trailer on the Today programme ahead of last night's episode of his Radio 4 show the Moral Maze. 

The Corporation later apologised after a number of complaints.

He said: 'Nobody comes out of the Ched Evans rape case with any credit – not the victim who’d drunk so much she could barely stand, nor the two footballers who had sex with her in the most sordid of circumstances.’ 

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live today, he said: 'If I gave the impression that the two issues of her being drunk and the rape for which Ched Evans was convicted were some sort of moral equivalent, that would be terrible and something I would need to apologise for. It was not my intention.'

He said: 'If people took from it the impression that I was blaming the victim for the rape, that was absolutely not my intention.

'Having said that, the fact that the victim was drunk was the central issue in the court case. In fact, it was her case that she was so drunk she was incapable of giving consent.

'I'm not sure we're in the position where subsequently we shouldn't mention that, or perhaps I was clumsy. 

Buerk said he was 'totally responsible' for the content of the short trailer, which he wrote himself before it was broadcast during Radio 4's Today programme yesterday.  

'Determined': Ched Evans pleaded for a second chance to play football again - and insisted he was innocent

Attack: Evans, who despite his conviction maintains his innocence, raped the girl in a Premier Inn, pictured arriving on CCTV with Clayton McDonald, in an attack also filmed by friends

Evans' victim had drunk two glasses of wine, four double vodkas and a sambuca on the night she was raped, and the jury unanimously agreed she could not have consented to sex with Evans in 2012. 

TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy by claiming his crime was 'non violent' and did not cause 'bodily harm' during a panel discussion on ITV's Loose Women. 

She also said the victim had 'had too much to drink'. 

The woman was raped his victim in a Rhyl Premier Inn in 2012 after his footballer friend Clayton McDonald, who was cleared of rape, texted Evans on the way there saying: 'I've got a bird'.

McDonald had sex with the victim, before Evans arrived and raped her, as two others filmed it through the window. 

Evans apologised last night – but only to his long-suffering girlfriend for cheating on her with the teenager he was convicted of raping.

In a halting video statement posted directly on to a website set up to try to clear his name, the 25-year-old said he had made ‘an incredibly foolish decision’ by having sex with the drunken girl and ‘learnt a valuable lesson’.

But he failed to use the opportunity to condemn his supporters for suggesting she had lied over the attack to cash in on his status as a wealthy footballer or illegally circulating her name online.

The closest he came to alluding to how his victim – now 22 – had been forced to abandon her old life was an expression of regret at ‘the damage that has been done on so many fronts’ because of that night.

Prosecuted: Ched Evans, pictured on this week with his girlfriend Natasha Massey, was found guilty of rape because his victim was unable to consent

Instead he concentrated on confirming his determination to clear his name while pushing for a return to the ‘privilege’ of being a professional footballer again. 

TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy on ITV's Loose Women by claiming his crime was 'non violent' and also said the victim had 'had too much to drink'

The 25-year-old former Sheffield United player made the comments on YouTube as his girlfriend Natasha Massey clutched his arm and wore what could be  an engagement ring.

Police are investigating his family  because CCTV footage of his victim was published on his official website.

The woman is seen walking into the Premier Inn in Rhyl where she was attacked by Evans, who was released from prison last week.

North Wales Police told MailOnline they are 'looking into' the post named: 'Too drunk to consent, too drunk to remember?', which uses the footage from the night of the rape two years ago. 

The woman he attacked, 22, continues to be targeted by trolls who support Evans.

She has had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012.

She was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a 'slag', 'tramp', 'bitch' and 'whore'.

Police put her 'relocation package' together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet.

But Twitter trolls have continued to pursue her even though illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £5,000, and now claim to have revealed her new identity.

She may have to take another new name and move again.
