Actress Daniele Watts, who played the slave CoCo in Django Unchained, and her boyfriend have formally been charged with lewd conduct, one month after claiming Los Angeles Police racially profiled her and cuffed her because she is black.

Watts maintains that she and boyfriend Brian James Lucas were only kissing in her car, parked outside the CBS Studio Center, when police approached them on September 4.

However, witnesses told police that the two were having sex in public and the LAPD stepped in to investigate the claims.

Charged: Actress Daniele Watts (right) and boyfriend Brian James Lucas have been charged with lewd conduct after a witness called police last month to report them having sex in a parked car 

Watts maintains that she and her boyfriend were only kissing. A witness snapped this picture of the couple before police broke up the public display of affection 

Watts was cuffed when she refused to show a responding officer her identification. She was later released without charge. 

An arraignment is scheduled for November 13, and if convicted of the misdemeanor the two could face a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.  

Her boyfriend took a picture of her crying after her arrest, and it quickly went viral. 

While civil rights activists initially rallied around the actress, she is not being asked to apologize after the LAPD viciously denied that any racial profiling happened in the incident. 

Sobbing: Lucas posted a picture of his girlfriend to Facebook. She claimed the LAPD had racially profiled her but it has since been revealed that her arresting officers were minorities 

They backed that claim by releasing an audio recording of the arrest in which officers struggle to explain the arrest to a hysterical Watts.

'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me,' she says through tears.

'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' 

Allegations: Watts is perhaps best known for her small role in Django Unchained, playing a slave called Coco. She also posted the picture on the right to Facebook, claiming she was injured in the arrest

Watts' claims were not taken well by the responding officers, which included a woman and a hispanic. 

Sgt Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the force, who is openly gay, was another one of the responding officers, and says she picked the wrong group to allege profiling. 

'How funny it is. She kind of didn’t really get the right mix there. It’s quite comical.' 

'It’s a new generation. It’s not about who you are or what religion you are or what color you are, it's about who you are and what you do in uniform,' he told MailOnline.
