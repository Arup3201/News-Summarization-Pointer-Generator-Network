Most pensioners keep busy in their retirement by taking water-colour classes or tending to their allotment.

But Colin Francome, from Colindale, north London, has found an alternative way to stay active in his old age - by dating multiple partners and going to sex parties.

The 70-year-old has been frequenting wild swingers events in Hertfordshire populated by other kinky pensioners for more than 25 years.

Colin said: 'It's good fun to go to parties - especially if you like sex. wrote a book called Improving Men's Health and found that men who had more sex were healthier than men who had less sex.

'Sex is for fun - and if you can't have a bit of fun in life, where are you? What are you here for?'

And as Colin's X-rated tales make clear, these parties are definitely not for the frail or faint-hearted.

'I've seen some wild things in my time - at one party there was a man in his mid 60s who brought along a younger woman in her early forties,' he said.

'She was just going around making out with all of the older guys in the house, I couldn't help but watch.

Colin, who is a keen juggler, says he is currently seeing six women aged 29-66

Colin added: 'Afterwards he said to me "it's a lot of fun, we can enjoy talking about it afterwards".'

The ex-academic, a former sociology professor at Middlesex University, now works as a part-time clown - and his juggling skills come in handy in his love life.

Colin currently has six women - who range from 29 to 66 in age - on the go at the same time.

He said: 'I love sex, I'd say I have it at least twice a week - which I think at my age is pretty good. I've been monogamous for maybe a year or two years but it just didn't work for me - I like variety.

'I'm known to my friends as someone who's had a few relationships in my time. But I'm not in a monogamous relationship, so it's not as if I'm betraying anyone.'

While for some pensioners, the passion of youth is a distant memory, Colin's sex drive is still up to speed, although these days he requires chemical assistance in the form of Viagra - which he gets free on the NHS - to keep up with the demands of his harem.

He added: 'At my age it can be difficult to get erections, so I went to my GP and he prescribed me Viagra.

'At first it was dear, it worked out at £110 for 16 tablets - that's about £7 per session of nookie! It's much cheaper now since the patent lapsed, but these days I get it free on the NHS.

'I only need to take half a tablet, but I've got a friend who takes two - just to make sure.'

And despite the numerous notches on his bedpost, Colin says he long ago gave up trying to remember the number of women he has bedded.

Colin has written a book entitled The True Sexual Behaviour of the British which he proudly holds

He said: 'I stop counting when I got to 25 in my twenties - but it's definitely more than 100.

'That only works out at a bit over one a year - although even now, I doubt a year would go by without me gaining a new partner.'

And far from being seedy, the silver-haired lothario is keen to paint his womanising as a form of public service.

He said: 'When you are younger you've got a lot of sexual urges but there's not that many women around because a lot of them will be locked up by their father.

'But when you're old like me, there's lots of women available because a lot of the men have died off - so I can offer support to several women. I like to think that what I do is noble.'

Colin attends swinging parties with his friends, notoriously at swinging parties people throw their keys into a bowl in order to find themselves new partner

Colin is due to appear in OAPs Behaving Badly, a new Channel 5 series showcasing the lives of Britain's wildest pensioners.

The twice-divorced, Strongbow-loving academic has four children by three different women - as well as a coterie of regular lovers around the globe.

In the UK they include a GP who is a long-term lover, one of his female bridge partners, and a woman from Sierra Leone who he met when supervising her phD and now lives in the UK.

However, Colin also has sexual partners overseas, including a 29-year-old lady in Zambia, and a retired social worker in America.

And while his sexual exploits may be unusual among men his age, he has no plans to give up his womanising ways any time soon. 'I hope I'm still going when I'm 90,' he added.
