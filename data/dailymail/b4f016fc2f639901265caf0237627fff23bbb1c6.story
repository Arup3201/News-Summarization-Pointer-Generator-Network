For many people, the chance to meet the Pope is the opportunity of a lifetime. 

But for this shy toddler, the occasion got the better of him as he turned his back on the Pope while his elated mother posed for a selfie.

The photo took place at the Vatican's Paul VI Hall where Pope Francis greeted a group of Italian adult scouts today.

The toddler turned his back on the Pope to the amusement of onlookers who had gathered to see him 

In a talk, he emphasised the importance of marriage, family and children. 

This is not the first time Pope Francis has demonstrated he is in-touch with today's society.

Last year, he posed for what was believed to be the first ever 'papal selfie' when he was snapped with a group of teenagers who had travelled from the Diocese of Piacenza and Bobbio for a pilgrimage.

In April, Pope Francis made a remarkable break in protocol by delivering an off-the-cuff homily and posing for selfies during Palm Sunday celebrations.

The Pontiff joined around 100,000 Romans, tourists and pilgrims in St Peter's Square in Vatican City to commemorate Jesus's entry into Jerusalem before his crucifixion.

In a startling move, he abandoned his prepared homily and spoke entirely off-the-cuff to the crowds.

And he continued to stray from the script - climbing off his Popemobile to pose for selfies, hugging young children and babies and even sipping cups of 'mate', a tea-like drink, passed to him from worshippers. 

The head of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide has already amassed more than four million followers on the social networking site Twitter as part of his efforts to understand and integrate with youths since he succeeded Pope Benedict XVI.

In a talk today, Pope Francis called on Christian parents to live out their educational mission relying on the 'sacrament of marriage', enhancing dialogue, debate and openness to schools, parishes and associations

He said: 'All vocations take their first steps in the family…a movement such as yours, based on continuing education…for you, Christian parents, the educational mission finds its source in the sacrament of marriage, in which the raising of children constitutes a true ministry in the Church'

Elsewhere, it was announced today that American Cardinal Raymond Burke, 66, a fervent opponent of abortion and gay marriage, has been removed by Pope Francis from another top Vatican post.

Burke's removal as head of the Holy See's supreme court was expected. 

Last year Francis took Burke off the Vatican's powerful Congregation for Bishops. 

While previously leading the St. Louis diocese, Burke was a vocal hardliner in a campaign which included calls for Catholic politicians supporting legalised abortion to be denied Communion.

He also gave a series of recent interviews criticising the Pope and had emerged as the face of conservative opposition to Francis' reform agenda.  

Pope Francis today transferred Burke from the Vatican court job to the largely ceremonial post as patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a charity.
