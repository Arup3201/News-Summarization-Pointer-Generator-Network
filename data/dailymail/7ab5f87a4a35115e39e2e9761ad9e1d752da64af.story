As they say, there's beauty in the breakdown.

Photographer Jo Ann Walters is based in New York but grew up in a small working class town in Illinois, along the Mississippi River Valley.

There, industrial labor didn't make up part of the workforce - it was the only work, period.

'Nearly everyone I knew had fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, friends and lovers who labored in these local factories, working night shifts, calculating the material and emotional expense of holiday pay and overtime, and who often drank hard and steady,' Waters explained on her personal website.

Walters began shooting and compiling the project, which she called DOG Town, in 2004, starting with the hometown that inspired her and branching out to similar places in neighboring states like Ohio and Missouri.

Despite the ominous tone, what Walters found was something earthy and beautiful.

'Together these pictures comprise a quiet, often starkly beautiful meditation on the mineral wastes and dregs of an unsparing, indifferent economy,' she said.

'And, though I have employed the elegant, well-worn mannerisms of photographic documentation, DOG Town is not merely a historical record.

'It is also an elegiac work of remembrance, mourning, regret and conciliation for my father and men at work in a different time and place.'

When asked why she called the project DOG Town, Walters said: 'I was looking for something that nobody else wanted anymore, something anonymous, something forgotten.'
