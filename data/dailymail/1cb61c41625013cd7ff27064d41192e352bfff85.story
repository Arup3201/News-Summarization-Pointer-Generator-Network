A woman paid $22,000 to have a Connecticut couple's baby fled across the country and had the child after refusing their instructions to abort it when ultrasound scans revealed a series of disabilities.

Five months into the pregnancy last year, surrogate mother Crystal Kelley was told the bad news by doctors - beginning a tragic and heartbreaking ordeal for her and the baby's parents.

Following a legal battle with the parents, Crystal, 29, flew to Michigan to give birth according to CNN, leaving the child to be fostered, instead of being raised by either herself or the intended parents.

In August of 2011, Crystal, who has two children of her own, fell into financial difficulties and offered her services through an established surrogacy agency to a couple who desperately wanted a fourth child but couldn't have one.

They paid $22,000 to Crystal and then an embryo the pair had left over from a previous round of in-vitro fertilization was used on October 8th.

Just ten days later Crystal fell pregnant and the thrilled couple asked to be as involved as possible throughout the following nine months.

The would-be mother phoned daily to offer morning sickness sympathy and gave Crystal and her two daughters Christmas presents and even paid out the monthly surrogate fee early to help her out.

'She said, 'I want you to come to us with anything because you're going to be part of our lives forever,' said Kelley to CNN.

In February though, everything changed when ultrasound tests began to show that the baby was not developing as was hoped.

Disaster struck though in the fifth-month of the pregnancy when a scan revealed the unborn child had significant abnormalities including a cleft lip and palate (pictured)

Doctors suspected that the baby had a cleft lip and palate, a cyst in her brain and serious heart defects. They couldn't even see a stomach or a spleen.

On February 16th, 2012, with the parents at the ultrasound with Crystal, their worst fears were confirmed.

Physicians at Hartford Hospital said the baby would need several surgeries after birth and had only a 25 per cent chance of living a normal life.

After this bombshell news, a letter was sent to Crystal's midwife, in which Dr Elisa Gianferrari, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Hartford Hospital, and Leslie Ciarleglio, a genetic counselor, outlined the parents' wishes.

'Given the ultrasound findings, (the parents) feel that the interventions required to manage (the baby's medical problems) are overwhelming for an infant, and that it is a more humane option to consider pregnancy termination,' they wrote according to CNN.

However, Crystal, who is staunchly religious, disagreed and said that 'all efforts should be made to give the baby a chance'.

For the parents though, who had gone through three previous premature births that left two of their children with medical problems, the abortion was the most humane option.

But the disagreement turned sour and developed into an emotional stand-off between the parents and Crystal.

'They said they didn't want to bring a baby into the world only for that child to suffer. ... They said I should try to be God-like and have mercy on the child and let her go,' said Crystal to CNN.

'I told them that they had chosen me to carry and protect this child, and that was exactly what I was going to do,' said Kelley.

'I told them it wasn't their decision to play God.'

Unsure of their legal rights, the parents were stunned to discover that only Crystal could arrange and go through with an abortion.

But the couple soon let Crystal's agency at Surrogacy International know that if she brought the pregnancy to term they wouldn't be the baby's legal parents - leaving the child to her.

Crystal questioned whether she wanted to become a mother again, especially since the only income she could count on was the surrogacy fee and child support from her own daughters' father.

Rita Kron from Surrogacy International explained to Crystal the realities of bringing up a disabled child and said the parents would pay her $10,000 to have the termination.

Crystal refused - demanding $15,000 to have an abortion.

Crystal already had two daughters of her own and left for Ann Arbor in Michigan to have the child - which she arranged to give up for adoption in that state

Claiming this was a moment of weakness, Crystal toldÂ CNN that she immediately regretted the counter-offer, which was totally refused by the parents.

With the 24-week legal limit for a termination rapidly approaching, the desperate couple hired a lawyer.

'You are obligated to terminate this pregnancy immediately,' wrote Douglas Fishman, an attorney in West Hartford, Connecticut. 'You have squandered precious time.'

He reminded her that she had signed a contract agreeing to 'abortion in case of severe fetus abnormality'. But the contract did not stipulate what this meant.

Fishman said she was in breach of contract and that if she did not abort she would be sued for the money already paid, which was $8,000 and the medical fees and legal fees to date.

Hiring her own lawyer, Michael DePrimo, an attorney in Hamden, Connecticut, Crystal fought back by sticking to her resolution not to have the abortion.

However, the story took another turn when the parents changed their minds and said they would now exercise their legal rights to take custody of the child - but after the birth would surrender her to the state of Connecticut for foster care.

After a difficult birth - Baby.S . was born in June and was handed over for adoption after Crystal and the child's parents came to a legal agreement

At this point, DePrimo explained to his client that the law was firmly on the parents' side.

However, Crystal now decided that she couldn't stand the thought of the baby in foster care.

Running out of options, Crystal was advised that she could go to a state where the birth-mother, and not the genetic parents, would be considered the legal guardian.

So, on April 11th, in her seventh month of pregnancy, Crystal moved her daughters to Michigan and only as she was driving away told her attorney to inform the couple of her plans.

'Once I realized that I was going to be the only person really fighting for her, that Mama bear instinct kicked in, and there was no way I was giving up without a fight,' said Kelley to CNN.

Choosing Michigan to have the baby was also a medical decision too - C.S. Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan has one of the best pediatric heart programs in the country.

Once firmly established in a small, cheap, sub-let in Ann Arbor, Crystal came to another realization - she could not keep the child, but she would give the child up for adoption in Michigan.

Locating a couple who wanted to take on a special needs child, Crystal prepared to come to term and hand the child over.

Baby S will need years of medical attention and operations to cure the problems she was born with

With one month to go, the parents filed an order in Connecticut Superior Court that they wanted to be the legal guardians - but they were forced to admit that the wife was not the baby's genetic mother as an anonymous egg donor had been used.

As this latest legal battle was thrashed out in court, the child, a girl, was born on June 25th weighing six pounds, with Crystal's name on the birth certificate.

Three weeks passed until both sides came to an understanding - the father gave up his paternal rights so long as he and his wife could keep in touch with the Michigan adoptive parents.

In the seven months since, the couple have visited the child known as Baby S and held her in their arms.

'They do care about her well-being. They do care about how she's doing,' the unnamed adoptive mother said to CNN.

But the child's medical problems have become far more serious than the ultrasound back in Connecticut first revealed.

The seven-month-old child has a birth defect called holoprosencephaly, where the brain doesn't completely divide into distinct hemispheres.

She also has a condition called heterotaxy, which means many of her internal organs, such as her liver and stomach, are in the wrong places in her body.

Her head is small, her right ear is deformed, she has a cleft lip and a cleft palate, and a long list of complex heart defects.

Already. she's had one open-heart surgery and surgery on her intestines, and over the next year she'll have one or two more cardiac surgeries.

If the child, named Baby S for legal reasons, does survive, there's a 50 per cent chance she won't be able to walk or talk.

As far as Crystal is concerned though, she did the right thing, even though some people have sent her hate messages through her blog, Surrogate Insanity.

'I can't tell you how many people told me that I was bad, that I was wrong, that I should go have an abortion, that I would be damned to hell,' she said.

'No matter what anybody told me, I became her mother.'
