Visas should be auctioned to the highest bidder to encourage the rich to settle in the UK, a group of Tory MPs has said.

Only those who could afford to buy permission to move here should be allowed to do so  according to the Free Enterprise Group, which is on the right of the party.

This would attract large companies and wealthy individuals and bar those who could not ‘add significant value to the economy’, it claims in a report, The Innovation Economy: Industrial Policy for the 21st Century.

The Free Enterprise Council want to encourage richer people to settle in Britain as they will bring more to the economy

They call for an ‘entrepreneurial immigration policy’ and a crackdown on welfare eligibility for immigrants.

George Freeman, MP for Mid Norfolk, said: ‘We need to do more to unleash an entrepreneurial ethos. 

‘This requires bold new thinking like a pro-enterprise immigration policy and a new deal for business. This is how we build a global vision for developing a competitive economy and succeeding in the global race.

The group, which is on the right side of the Conservative party, calls for Network Rail to be broken up into regional franchises

The report suggests radical reforms to promote competition in banking and energy, two sectors it says have become dominated by small players dependent on Government subsidies.

It calls for Network Rail to be broken up into regional franchises and for a wide programme of tax cuts and deregulation for start-ups, as well as regional pay in the public sector.

Mr Freeman said: ‘The scale of the crisis inherited from New Labour’s borrowed boom – bankrupt public finances, a broken model of boom and bust growth and dependency on government, whether in quantitative easing or green subsidies – demands new thinking.

‘Too much of the debate in Westminster is still shaped by old and redundant dogma.’
