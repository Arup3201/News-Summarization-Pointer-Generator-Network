The mother of murdered schoolboy Breck Bednar warned police about his killer but they did not act despite him being on two crime databases

The mother of murdered schoolboy Breck Bednar has spoken of her fury after it emerged his sadistic killer was on two national crime databases but the police did not act.

Breck's mother Lorin LaFave was told on Thursday that her son's killer Lewis Daynes, 19, was on both the Police National Computer and the Police National Database (PND) following a sexual assault and rape allegation.

But despite that Surrey Police did not take action when Ms LaFave, 47, told them of her concerns about Daynes.

Two months after she warned the police he was grooming Breck, 14, Daynes lured her son to his flat in Essex and stabbed him to death.

Daynes killed the boy in what was described in court as a 'sexual and sadistic' attack before calling 999 to claim he had stabbed him following an 'altercation'.

Ms LaFave, 47, told the Sunday People: 'It's unforgiveable. It was there in black and white that another boy of Breck's age had accused Daynes of grooming him and then sexually assaulting him.

'All it needed was for the police to run his name through the system and they would have noticed the pattern.

'But no one picked up on it and now my son is dead. I felt like dying when I found out. I still feel like dying now.'

Until now, Breck's family thought Daynes' alleged crimes had been missed by Surrey Police because they were recorded in Essex, but the new information suggests this was not true.

That is because the allegations, which the Crown Prosecution Service decided against pressing charges over, were logged on to the systems which can be accessed by any police force.

Daynes' name was added to the PND just weeks before tragic Breck and some of his friends met the killer online.

Ms LaFave said: 'We thought the previous allegations were missed because Daynes never went to trial over them – just one of those tragic things that couldn't be helped.

'But I got a call from Essex Police on Thursday that confirmed the accusations were recorded – not once, but twice.

'They went on the Police National Computer in September 2011 after the allegations were first made, then ­added to the Police National Database in March 2013. I was completely shocked. It makes Breck's death all the more difficult to deal with, knowing that something could have been done to stop it.' 

Home Office guidance on the PND says that it is 'crucial' that police forces use the system consistently.

But it was not in Breck's case and two months after his mother's worried 30-minute call to the police, her son was brutally murdered at Daynes' flat in Grays' Essex.

Yesterday it emerged that the 999 handler who took the call from Ms LaFave had resigned.

The call handler has stood down and another staff member has been served with a misconduct notice by the police watchdog, which is investigating how the force responded to claims the boy was being groomed in the months leading up to his murder.

A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'A review of our call-handling centre has been carried out and changes have been implemented to improve the way information is handled and shared.

'There is an independent investigation led by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and we cannot comment further at this time.'
