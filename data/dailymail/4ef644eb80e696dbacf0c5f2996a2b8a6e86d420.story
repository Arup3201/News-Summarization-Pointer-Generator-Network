Possible Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham, the senior senator from South Carolina, is apologizing for a jab he made about House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress on Tuesday.

At a private meeting with donors Graham alleged that plastic surgery was masking the House Minority leader's 'disgust' at the Israel leader's words.

Xavier Becerra, left, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, center, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, right,  listen to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu address to a joint meeting of Congress in the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday. They appeared less than enthused as Netanyahu asked them not to approve the nuclear deal the Obama administration and its allies are negotiating with Iran

During the joint address Pelosi and other members of Democratic leadership appeared less than enthused as Netanyahu asked them not to approve the nuclear deal the Obama administration and its allies are negotiating with Iran and to put crippling sanctions on the country. 

Afterward, Pelosi said in a statement she 'was near tears throughout' Netanyahu's speech because she was 'saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States' and 'by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation.'  

Later that afternoon Graham made fun of the California Democrat during a conversation with a donor, according to Bloomberg, saying, 'Did you see Nancy Pelosi on the floor. Complete disgust.'

'If you can get through all the surgeries, there’s disgust,' he remarked.

Upon learning of Graham's comment, several of his Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate demanded that he retract the statement.

If reports are 'accurate,' fellow South Carolinian James Clyburn said on Twitter, 'he owes her an apology.'

'What's disgusting are the horrific comments you made about the first woman Speaker of the House,' Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a close friend of Pelosi's, tweeted at Graham.

Graham told NBC on Tuesday evening that while he found Pelosi's claim that she was near tears 'a bit disturbing' he shouldn't have insulted her appearance.  

'I made a poor attempt at humor to talk about her reaction and for that I apologize,' he said.

'[Netanyahu] is not the problem in the mid-east, it's the Iranians, and anyone who wants to focus on the Prime Minister of Israel I think has got their priorities wrong,' he added.

Graham is a fierce opponent of the Obama administration's approach to foreign relations in the Middle East. He has said that he is 'testing the waters' for a presidential run, though he's not formally launched a campaign for the highest elected office in the nation.
