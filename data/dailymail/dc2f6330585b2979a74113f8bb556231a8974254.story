A missing 15-year-old girl and the 37-year-old male family friend she allegedly ran away with have been found in a Michigan field with self-inflicted wounds to the wrist, police have confirmed.

Emily Lalinksy and Robert Messer were taken to separate hospitals to be treated for the identical 'superficial' wounds after they were discovered in Washtenaw County, near 7 Mile and Chubbs Road in Northville on Tuesday afternoon. Messer is now in police custody pending charges.

Authorities had been searching for the missing teen since she vanished from her home in Plymouth Township on Sunday, leaving a note professing her love for the much older family friend and saying they wouldn't be coming back. The two left behind their cellphones and other belongings.

Found: Emily Lalinksy, pictured, and Robert Messer were taken to separate hospitals to be treated for identical wrist wounds that are reportedly 'superficial' after they were discovered in Washtenaw County, Michigan on Tuesday afternoon

Have you seen them? Police had been appealing to the public for help and received a number of tips that may have led them to the couple's hiding place

Earlier on Tuesday, Lieutenant Cal Lauria told 
Mlive.com that police were following up leads and were growing 
increasingly concerned for Lalinsky's safety.

'We believe that she is endangered, 
and that's based on the ongoing investigation,' he said. 'We believe 
that Mr Messer's mental state may be in question.'

Speaking to MailOnline, the teen's 
siblings expressed their delight and said they were looking forward to 
welcoming their sister home.

One said: 'We're all so happy, so relieved.'

They said they do not expect their 
sister home tonight and that she is currently in hospital and being 
interviewed by police. Robert Messer is in a separate hospital.

Earlier, former neighbor Donna Kelm 
told MailOnline that she had regularly seen Lalinsky and Messer 'kissing
in his truck and holding hands.'

'I worried something like this would happen. This has been going on a long time,' she said.

'I found it upsetting. I used to take care of those girls when they were
three and five. To see him kissing her. It's not right.'

Heartbroken: Lisa Schwartz sobbed as she said she had trusted Messer, who had been a family friend for years

Explanation: They left behind a letter explaining why they had run away and apologizing to their families

Messer, a recently divorced father-of-one
who has known Lalinsky since she was a little girl, had written in a note: 'We 
are in love and cannot be apart from each other.

'This is sad to us but our love, though 
we've had to keep it a secret, has been the best part of both our lives.
Please be happy for us.'

Lalinksy
added to her mom, Lisa Schwartz: 'You are an amazing and wonderful mother and person. I'm so 
sorry I hurt you and if there was any other way we would've done it.

'Try not to be sad and don't blame yourself, nothing could be done.'

Schwartz earlier wiped away the tears as she 
said how she felt betrayed by a man who was 'like a brother to me'.

She
added that the pair, who had met at church, had never showed any signs 
they had feelings for each other. She said that Messer, who is from 
South Lyon, has one son and got a divorce last year.

'I trusted him,' Schwartz told ABC7. 'My whole family trusted him. My daughter trusted him. Bob was always 
like a brother to me.

Runaways: 15-year-old Emily Lalinsky, left, vanished from her Michigan home on Sunday with a family friend, 37-year-old Robert Messer (right), after they left a note behind saying they were in love

Quiet: Emily, whom her mother described as an introvert, has known Messer since she was a child

'Emily doesn't have a dad, so she always looked up
to Bob as a dad, as a father figure. They're both very introverted. They both love photography and they both love hiking.'

Schwartz, who has six children and is 
recently married, said she had always appreciated the time Messer had spent with
her daughter because she had been so busy with the family.

'With
me having so many kids I could not just take her and do things with 
her, so he was like, "I'll take her to Ann Arbor, I'll take her to 
Botanical Gardens",' she recounted.

Lisa
and her husband Neil reported her daughter missing on Sunday night and 
police had been treating it as a missing person case.

'We can work through this, we always do,' her mother pleaded. 'I love you. Just come home.'

Authorities told Schwartz on Tuesday that
there were tips coming in and confirmed at around 5:20 p.m. that 
Lalinsky had indeed been found safe.

Police were searching for Messer's 1991 
two-tone brown Ford truck and had appealed to the public for help. He 
had recently told colleagues he wanted to travel to Oregon or Idaho.

Schwartz said they might have gone to a national park together as they both enjoy hiking and regularly took trips together.

'I think once he realizes the magnitude 
of what he has done, he might hurt himself, and I don't know where that 
would leave her,' the concerned mother told WDIV before the pair were found.
