A drug dealer who refused to pay James 'Whitey' Bulger a $100,000 tribute says he changed his mind after his 17-year-old brother was shot and Bulger told him: 'You're next.'

The testimony about threats, shootings and Bulger's grip on the South Boston narcotics trade wrapped up the fifth week of the former mob boss's murder and racketeering trial in his old hometown.

James 'Whitey' Bulger: He was one of the nation's most wanted fugitives after he fled Boston in 1994. He was finally captured two years ago in Santa Monica, California and faces 32 counts, including 19 murder charges

Bulger, accused of murdering or ordering the killing of 19 people in the 1970s and 1980s while he ran South Boston's feared 'Winter Hill' gang, demanded payment from drug dealers and imposed rules on their business, the witnesses said.

Anthony Attardo, 55, told jurors he 
had been dealing cocaine in South Boston for six years when members of 
Bulger's gang approached him in 1985, asking him to buy cocaine from 
them. When he refused, they demanded a cut of $100,000 he said.

Attardo, a former boxer, said he tried to deceive Bulger, saying he had gotten out of the drug trade.

'He
said, 'Don't lie to me. The money's so good the only time you're going 
to quit is when you go to jail,'' Attardo recalled. 'And he was right 
about that.'

Not wanting to pay the feared mobster, Attardo tried to avoid him, until his 17-year-old brother was shot.

'Mr. Bulger said to me, 'You're next 
if I don't get my money.' And I said, 'I'll meet you down at the liquor 
store,'' Attardo said. 'I grew up in Southie all my life. Everybody knew
his reputation. Very dangerous, he meant what he said.'

Bulger,
who faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted on charges 
that include racketeering and drug dealing, has pleaded not guilty.

His
lead attorney, J.W. Carney of the Boston law firm Carney & Bassil, 
admitted in opening statements that Bulger was an extortionist, loan 
shark and drug dealer and earlier this week described Bulger as an 
'organized criminal.'

Jury heard from alleged victims: Steve Davis, brother of alleged murder victim Debra Davis, answers a reporter's question outside federal court

Emotional testimony: The jury heard from Steve Davis, the brother of Debra (pictured). She was just 26 when she was allegedly strangled by either Bulger or her then-boyfriend, Stephen Flemmi, in September 1981

Outspoken tough guy Steve Davis broke down in tears as he testified against the man accused of murder his sister, Debra Davis.

She was just 26 when she was allegedly strangled by either Bulger or her then-boyfriend, Stephen Flemmi in September 1981. Davis said he was close with his sister, and that she only had two enemies.

'Those two enemies were Steve Flemmi and Whitey Bulger, because that's why she's not here today,' he said.

'She was a beautiful young woman. She had no enemies, except for two. Everybody that met her loved her,' said Steve Davis as he choked back tears. 'She was my best friend growing up.'

Prosecutors say Bulger strangled her inside a South Boston apartment after she attempted to end her relationship with Flemmi.

Davis said after his sister's disappearance, Flemmi would come to his family's home and tell them he was doing everything he could to find her and urged them not to call police.

Davis said he didn't believe Flemmi for a second. Davis has regularly attended the trial.

Patricia Donahue also testified, detailing the last time she spoke with her husband, Michael Donahue, before he was killed on May 11, 1982.

She said she didn't think anything about a 'gangland' murder being reported on the news until she saw her father-in-law's car on the television. Her husband had been driving it, and it was shown riddled with bullets.

'I had no idea where he was,' she said, describing her search for information after seeing the news. 'I called every hospital in this city, nobody would give up any information. I couldn't tell my children what was going on because I didn't know. I wanted to be with my husband. I wanted to make sure, if he was dying, that I was there with him. I didn't want him to be alone.'

Bulger is accused of shooting Donahue and Brian Halloran with another shooter who has never been identified.

Another former drug dealer who worked the neighborhood, said Bulger had imposed rules on the trade.

Paul Moore, 63, who testified against Bulger in the 1990s and then went into the witness protection program, said he sold marijuana and cocaine under the protection of the 'Winter Hill' gang but that other drugs were forbidden.

'You never sold drugs to children, did you?' defense attorney Carney asked Moore, who replied, 'You'd get hurt if you did anything like that.'

While Bulger's gang accepted thousands of dollars a week in tribute for his sales of cocaine and marijuana, Moore said the gang prohibited him from selling heroin and 'angel dust,' a form of marijuana laced with other drugs believed more dangerous.

Bulger fled Boston after a 1994 tip from corrupt FBI agent John Connolly. He evaded arrest for 16 years before the FBI caught up with him when he was hiding in an apartment in Santa Monica, California.

After Bulger fled the city, Attardo said he tried to take a page from the Winter Hill playbook when a friend told him that people who he believed to be drug dealers from the Dominican Republic were selling drugs in the neighborhood.

'I decided with him that maybe we should pull a Whitey Bulger and extort them,' Attardo said.

As it turned out, the so-called drug dealers were undercover police officers.

'So that didn't work out to well for you?' Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Hafer asked Attardo.

'No, it did not,' replied Attardo, who was later sentenced to 9-1/2 years in prison for drug offenses.
