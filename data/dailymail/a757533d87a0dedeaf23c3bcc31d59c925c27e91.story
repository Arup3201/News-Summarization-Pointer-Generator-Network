He hasn’t scored as many goals at Celtic Park as certain rivals in the race to replace Neil Lennon; Oscar Garcia has just the one to his name and, to be honest, the only strike in a 1996 friendly is unlikely to rival any of  Henrik Larsson’s in terms of emotional impact.

What the former Barcelona  midfielder lacks in Celtic credentials, though, he perhaps makes up for in suitability for this particular job. Not because he can drop the names of Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal into conversations about his formative footballing years.

But because his outlook sits so easily with the philosophy of a club constrained by financial realities.

Up for the job: Garcia, who left Brighton after narrowly missing out on promotion, has put his name forward

A coach who felt let down by alleged broken promises from the Brighton board last season,  resigning after failure at the  semi-final stages of the  Premier League play-offs, Garcia does not shy away when the issue of  Celtic’s established model — buy ‘em young, flog ‘em for a massive profit — is raised as a potential issue.

A short laugh is followed by the ex-Barca Under-19s and Maccabi Tel Aviv boss telling Sportsmail: ‘For me, it’s amazing to work with young players, to develop them — and then, at the end of the day, the club has to decide what is best for the club and the players.

‘But for me to work with young players, I’ve done it all my life, not only at La Masia but in Tel Aviv — I played with a lot of young players.

‘And last season in Brighton, four of the young players from the youth department made their debuts for me. One became the Young Player of the Season, two others are currently playing in Toulon for the England Under-21 national team.

‘Celtic have done very well,  bringing players in and giving them a chance, then maybe moving them on. They have a good  reputation for developing talent.

‘I am not afraid to play with young players, if they are good enough. And I know that, in the youth department at Celtic, there are a lot of good players.

‘I know that, already in the club, they have talent. I know that the Under-20s just won their title, so they obviously have good players in there. Celtic is a club that works very hard on developing young players.’

Garcia certainly learned at the feet of masters, citing Cruyff as the greatest of all as he recalls a  Barcelona playing career that saw him share a pitch with Romario, Ronaldo, Hristo Stoichkov and Luis Figo, among others.

It is his work as a coach within the fabled La Masia youth system at Barca that really brought him to wider attention, though, and the Celtic coaches who saw his  Under-19s side beat their Hoops counterparts home and away  a few years ago were hugely impressed.

Still, working with kids is one thing. Especially at a big club with the pick of the world’s young  talent. What has he done in the senior game?

Well, in between dodging Hamas attacks on the city, he guided  Maccabi Tel Aviv to their first league title in 10 years. If he didn’t quite steer Brighton to the  Premier League promised land, he wasn’t that far away.

There is a reason that those close to the process describe Garcia as a ‘very credible candidate’ for the Parkhead job. If he has no Celtic roots, that also means he arrives without baggage.

Parameters: The former Maccabi Tel-Aviv boss has shown he can work within financial constraints

Explaining his approach to  football and his own fledgling  managerial career, the 41-year-old said: ‘The biggest influence on me was Johan Cruyff. But I learned a lot from Louis van Gaal, from Jose Mourinho, from Bobby Robson. I had fantastic coaches in Barcelona and I learned a lot from them.

‘But I am Oscar Garcia. However much I learned from these great, great football people, I am myself — I have my thoughts and my thinking.

‘Obviously I agree with the  passing football philosophy,  keeping the ball, trying to keep the opposition moving, play in the opposition half as much as possible.

‘This is the best way to win games — and to make the fans happy. Because, at the end of the day, we play for the fans. They must enjoy to see their team play attractive football. Especially if we are winning.

‘I live my life by feelings. When I moved to Tel Aviv, nobody in  Barcelona thought it was the right thing. I told everybody it was the right thing — but nobody believed me. The same thing happened at Brighton. I move where it feels right.

‘Now I have refused four very good offers because I don’t have the right feelings. They are big clubs but I have refused them.

‘I’ve had some offers in Spain, some offers in England, some from other countries. I’m waiting for the right club, the right offer. I’m sure I will make the right decision. I am a lucky man. I always have decided where I want to manage and coach. I’m confident it will happen the same for me this time.’

Asked if he would choose Celtic over an offer from south of the  border, Garcia said: ‘First of all, I have to speak with the clubs, to have the right offer, the right  feeling.

Relaxed: Garcia is interested in the Celtic job but will need to make sure it suits him before accepting any offer

‘It doesn’t matter if it’s in  England, Scotland, Wales, France, Italy — I don’t care. The only thing I want is to have a good feeling.

‘I will choose a place where I can work as I want and where I have the right trust in the club, the right trust of the people.

‘Could I be happy at Celtic? Nobody has talked to me yet. I have spoken to some clubs, I have refused some offers. Now I am speaking to two big clubs and we’ll see what happens.

‘The good thing is to have enough offers to choose. That’s the reason I’m relaxed, because I believe I will choose correctly.’

Although Garcia is yet to speak with anyone directly about this position, his advisers have ‘put him in’ — to use the football parlance — and are understood to have been pleased with the response.

He at least should be familiar to some of the Celtic hierarchy, having formed part of the official Barcelona party for their recent Champions League encounters.

And, of course, he has that one challenge match appearance,  telling Sportsmail: ‘Yes, I  remember playing against Celtic — and I scored the goal. If I  remember, we won 1-0, so I was the match winner!

‘The fans of Celtic are amazing. It’s a fantastic stadium and one of the biggest and best clubs in the world. They have all the facilities, as well as passion for the game.’

So maybe he’s not the King of Kings. And maybe his words are only the usual flattery, the kind of stuff we’ve all heard a thousand times before.

But he’s young, he’s hungry, he’s got a good pedigree and he seems happy to work within fairly strict financial parameters. As left-field candidates go, he might not be so far out there as to be beyond serious consideration.
