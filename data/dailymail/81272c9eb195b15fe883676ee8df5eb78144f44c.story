They only welcomed their twins six weeks ago but Prince Albert II of Monaco and Princess Charlene showed no sign of suffering sleepless nights as they joined in the national celebrations for their patron saint.

The royal couple, who welcomed Prince Jacques Honoré Rainier and Princess Gabriella Thérèse Marie in December, stole a kiss at the traditional remembrance service for St. Devote in Monaco on Monday evening.

St Devote's Day is a national holiday in Monaco in remembrance of their patron saint. She was a Christan martyr who was killed and tortured for her faith in the 4th century.

Princess Charlene, 36, looked chic in a grey wrap coat, which she teamed with a striped scarf and leather boots. She wore her blonde hair in its signature pixie crop hairstyle and radiated a healthy glow.

Prince Albert, 56, looked dapper in a grey suit, paired with a burgundy scarf and smart black coat.

The new parents made their way through the crowds following a church service and stopped to shake hands with locals on their way.

They also helped set light to a fishing boat - a tradition that's been going strong since the reign of Prince Louis II in 1942.

According to legend, Christians saved St Devote's body and cast it off in a boat to Africa in the hope that once there she would receive a Christian burial. 

A dove then flew from her mouth and guided the boat to Monaco where it ran aground.

The Saint has helped the principality in times of peril ever since.

In line with the legend, Prince Albert and Princess Charlene took part in an annual ceremonial ritual remembering the Saint's final journey.

They were given torches which they used to set fire to a fisherman's boat like the one that the Saint's body was carried on.

On the December 10, Princess Charlene gave birth to the twins by caesarean section at the Princess Grace Hospital.

The babies were born within minutes of each other, with Gabriella arriving first at 5.04pm and Jacques following at 5.06pm. 

The births were greeted with cannon fire and an excited outpouring of joy from locals, who flocked to the square outside the Palais Princier to celebrate.

Despite being the younger of the two, it will be Prince Jacques who succeeds his father on the throne, thanks to Monaco's continued use of Salic law which states that male heirs always take precedence over their older sisters.

Gabriella stills gets a title though, becoming the Countess of Carlades, while Crown Prince Jacques is styled Marquis of Baux - a name always given to the first born son.

The first glimpse of the babies came 13 days after the birth, when a set of five photographs of the newborn royal babies and their proud parents was released by the Palais Princier on the December 23.
