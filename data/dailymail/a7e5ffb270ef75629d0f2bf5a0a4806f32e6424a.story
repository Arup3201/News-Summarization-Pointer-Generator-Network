The Obama administration dramatically moved Obamacare's second-year goalposts on Monday, saying that it expected no more than 9.9 million Americans to be enrolled in medical insurance through a government-managed system by the end of March. 

The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization that advises federal legislators, assumed that the number would be a much higher 13 million in April, when it built the financial projections under-girding the law's implementation.

Now the number could be as low as nine million. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Monday that her goal is 9.1 million.

That number could go lower still, if less than 83 per cent of current Obamacare enrollees – 5.9 million people in all – renew their coverage in 2015.

The news came just days after the Supreme Court said it would hear a case that could collapse the Obamacare system's financial structure.

The Health and Human Services Department also lowered another number, dropping to 7.1 million its total number of Americans covered through March 2014, during the program's first 'open enrollment' period.

The administration had said it enrolled 7.3 million, but many of those people were unable to complete enrollment.In total 112,000 people couldn't establish their citizenship or immigration status, which is required to qualify.

The overall lower estimates for the 2014-2015 enrollment period stems from a two-year slower than expected shift to the government system by Americans who have their own insurance.

'That's been much lower than the predictions,' HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell told an audience at the liberal Center for American Progress on Monday.

She also revealed that 'we've been writing letters' to 'folks who might come off the system,' in order to keep them in the fold next year. 

Barack Obama, both before and during his presidency, famously promised that Americans who wanted to keep their health plans would be able to. Now, however, maintaining Obamacare's solvency appears to depend on moving ever-more people away from the insurance they previously had outside government marketplaces.

In addition, 120,000 U.S. households can expect to see their insurance costs increase on Dec. 1 of this year because when they signed up, they provided insufficient information about their incomes. When those numbers are recalculated, the portion of their premiums that taxpayers subsidize could shrink or disappear.

FINGERS CROSSED: A year ago Healthcare.gov was a mess of historic proportions, but Burwell says her agency has increased the length of its software testing period by 350 per cent  

HHS officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters during a Monday conference call that the CBO had assumed there would be 'significant shifts over three years' from people in employer-provided insurance and individual plans.

But new data show 'there is considerable uncertainty that a large shift will occur over the new two years,' according to a new HHS report.

But 'I wouldn't characterize it as an error,' an official said during the conference call.

'We think the evidence points to a longer ramp-up rate than the CBO projections had, and that is based on what we've learned over the last year from looking at our own data.'

The Supreme Court case that justices agreed this weekend to hear will hinge on a single line in the law's text. At issue is whether the federal government is permitted to pay subsidies for insurance policies bought through its own Healthcare.gov website.

The Affordable Care Act provided a mechanism for those taxpayer subsidies, but a literal reading of the words only allows the payments for policies brokered by states. Thirty-six states fall outside that group.

Burwell said Monday that the White House will ultimately prevail because Congress intended to make everyone eligible for subsidies – regardless of what it wrote and passed into law.

'Nothing has changed,' she said, telling Americans that they shouldn't worry about whether their subsidies will be available in future years.

'The tax credits that they'll be signing up for, and the ones that they have, will be continuing.'

Burwell insisted on Monday that the Obama administration will win a second Obamacare challenge in the Supreme Court

'We believe that the law stated that the tax credits are an important part of affordable health care coverage – and that is for all,' Burwell added.

'We believe that that was the intention of the law, and believe that is where we will stay, and be.'

Without the subsidy payments, Obamacare's financial structure would collapse as lower-income Americans would see their out-of-pocket premiums skyrocket.  

Despite all the Affordable Care Act's growing pains – a non-fuctioning website 12 months ago, high deductibles and a flood of doctors away from serving Obamacare patients among them – Burwell threw the gauntlet down at the feet of a newly emboldened Republican U.S. Senate majority.

'The repeal of the Affordable Care Act is not something that this administration will let happen,' she vowed.

Asked how sure she was that the website would perform as advertised this time around, Burwell relied on numbers.

'Last year our testing was 10 days,' she said. 'This year our testing is five weeks.'
