Families face being 'clobbered' by a rise in interest rates, it was warned today as unemployment fell to within a whisker of the target set by the Bank of England.

A record number of people found work in the three months to November, as the economic recovery builds a head of steam.

It means the unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.1 per cent, just above the 7 per cent target set by Bank governor Mark Carney when he could consider putting up interest rates.

The unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.1%, putting it within a whisker of the 7% target set by the Bank of England when it could consider putting up interest rates

Surprise figures today show an extra 
280,000 people had a job in the last three months - the largest 
quarterly increase since records began in the 1970s.

In a huge boost for George Osborne's economic plan, there is now a record 30.15 million people in work. It comes after the International Monetary Fund said Britain would grow faster than any other European country.

Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter: 'The biggest quarterly increase in employment on record. More jobs means more security, peace of mind and opportunity for the British people.'

In the Commons today he said cuts in public 
spending meant the Government was able to offer voters tax cuts, which 
when they were taken in to account meant people were better off than in 
2010.

Mr Cameron told Labour leader Ed Miliband: 'We are cutting taxes for everyone in this country and we are only able to do that because we have controlled spending. What you cannot face is the fact that the economy is improving.

'The fact is today our plan is working. There are 1.3 million more people in work in our country. That is 1.3 million more people with the security of a pay packet. We are securing Britain's future and it would be put at risk by Labour.'

But Mr Miliband claimed many voters were facing a cost of living crisis as inflation continued to rise at a faster rate than wages.

A delighted David Cameron said the record number of new jobs was proof the government's economic plan is working

Of the 280,000 new jobs created from September to November, 220,000 were full-time - reversing a trend where many people were forced to take part-time work.

There was a fall in the number of people working part-time because they could not find full-time jobs - down by 12,000 to 1.4 million.

The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance in December fell by 24,000 to 1.25 million, the lowest figure for almost five years.

However the biggest shock was the fall in the unemployment rate, down from 7.4 per cent in August-October to 7.1 per cent.

An extra 280,000 jobs were created in September-November, the largest quarterly increase since records began in the 1970s

Young people should be prepared to 
take lowly jobs in coffee shops if they want to get on in life, the 
employment minister has said.

Esther
 McVey said jobseekers need reminding that they have to start at the 
bottom and work their way up, rather than expecting to walk into their 
dream job.

In an interview 
with the Mail, she admitted that young Britons are less prepared for the
 world of work than foreign migrants and need to learn the basics, such 
as turning up on time.

But she insisted that those who want 
to work hard can succeed if they are prepared to learn the ropes and ‘be
 realistic’ about their abilities.

Asked
 if they should be prepared to take ‘entry-level jobs’, she said: 
‘Absolutely. You could be working at Costa. But in a couple of years’ 
time you might say, “I’d like to manage the area” or might even want to 
run a hotel in Dubai.’

Bank of England governor Mark Carney had said that unemployment would have to reach 7 per cent before he would consider putting up interest rates.

It had been expected by the end of 2016 but it now seems almost certain to happen in the first half of this year.

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady 
said: 'It's encouraging to see another big fall in unemployment, 
particularly amongst young people who until now haven't benefited from 
rising job levels.

'But 
while headline unemployment is within a whisker of the Bank's forward 
guidance threshold, an early interest rate rise would clobber 
mortgage-holders and businesses - jeopardising our economic recovery.'

Mr Carney has in recent weeks rowed back from the idea of a sudden increase in interest rates, which could trigger a sharp rise in mortgage bills for families still not enjoying the benefits of the recovery.

In an attempt to quell fears of a sudden 
rate rise, minutes of the Bank’s meeting released today showed members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) 'see no 
immediate need to raise rates' regardless of the plunging unemployment rate.

New figures today also show wages are up just 0.9 per cent, while the CPI rate of inflation tracking the rise in living costs is at 2.1 per cent.

Employment minister Esther McVey said: 'Creating jobs and getting people into employment are central to our economic plan to build a stronger, more competitive economy, so it is very encouraging news that we’ve seen a record-breaking rise in employment over the last three months – the largest ever.

'With the highest quarterly fall in unemployment since 1997, it’s clear that the Government’s long-term economic plan to get people off benefits and into work so they can secure their future is proving successful.'

Labour's shadow work and pensions 
secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'Today’s fall in overall unemployment is 
welcome. The Government should use this opportunity to tackle the 
unacceptably high levels of long-term unemployment and youth 
unemployment.

'More than 900,000 young people are unemployed and over 250,000 young people are long-term unemployed. 

The
 Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) has said it will not 
lift interest rates above their historically-low level of 0.5 per cent 
until the unemployment rate drops to 7 per cent.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney will come under pressure to make clear if interest rights will rise this year as TUC leader Frances O'Grady warned a rise would 'clobber' families

Analysts had not expected the threshold to be reached until later in the year, although the Bank has since stressed a figure of  7 per cent will not automatically trigger an interest rate rise.

Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: 'It's now inevitable that unemployment will soon fall below the Bank of England's forward guidance rate of 7 per cent.

'However, the weakness of pay growth suggests there is still a considerable amount of slack in the labour market which for the time being remains an inflation free zone. Better news on jobs is no reason for an early rise in UK interest rates.'
