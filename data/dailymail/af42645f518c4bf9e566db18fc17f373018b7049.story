When Alex Song seems as if he is gliding across a pitch pinging the ball around it all looks so natural - but it is actually the result of a lot of hard work.

The West Ham midfielder, on loan from Barcelona, has played an integral part in the Hammers' impressive form this season and has shown his class and wonderful range of passing.

Song has revealed the secrets of his success by detailing his training routine on Instagram.

Alex Song posted the video on his Instagram account as he fields passes from fitness coach Eduardo Parra

The Cameroon international shows great control as he takes and give passes from different angles 

The West Ham midfielder rapidly alternates between three passing targets in the Hammers gym 

The video shows the Cameroon star working on his passing skills with West Ham's rehab fitness coach Eduardo Parra, popping the ball against a barrier before giving it back to Parra and repeating, using both feet.

Song currently has a passing accuracy of 79 per cent in the Premier League and, after watching this post, it's easy to see why.

Hammers boss Sam Allardyce will probably have to do without his star midfielder as well as top goalscorer Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate once the Africa Cup of Nations begins next month.

'We might have a little worrying spell during the Africa Cup of Nations in January,' said Allardyce. 

'That's why I'm not prepared to do any more predictions until they come back.

'We don't want to get carried away. We just want to keep on playing the football we're playing at the moment. Everyone is enjoying themselves, there's a good buzz around the training ground which is always a good sign.' 

Song has been superb in midfield for the high-flying Hammers in the Premier League this season
