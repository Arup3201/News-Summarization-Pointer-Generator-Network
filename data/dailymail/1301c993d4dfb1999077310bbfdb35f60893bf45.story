A longtime member of the National Guard was fatally shot at a Guard armory in Tennessee on Wednesday and a second man was taken into custody for questioning, officials said.

The shooting happened about 5 p.m. Wednesday in the town of Lobelville, about 75 miles southwest of Nashville, said Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine.

DeVine said the victim's name was not being released until his family members had been notified.

He said a top official, Maj. Gen. Max Haston, identified him as a sergeant first-class who had been with the guard for 20 years.

The victim suffered a gunshot wound to the chest after the suspect fired several shots. He was airlifted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville where he later died.

The armory is usually locked and it was unclear how the shooter got into the building, DeVine said.

He said the building does not have surveillance cameras, but that at least one other person besides the shooter and the victim was at the armory at the time. It was unclear whether there were any eyewitnesses, however, he said.

DeVine said 'a person of interest' was taken into custody for questioning, but had not been charged.

DeVine said the person, a man, was not employed at the armory.
