Any Instagram user would be proud to show off these stunning photos of London’s iconic landmarks on their timeline.

It turns out they can, as all it took to produce this magnificent portfolio was an iPhone and a tilt shift filter on an app.

Traveller Christian Barrett snapped the breathtaking images, which offer a bird’s eye view of the capital, as he flew into Heathrow Airport on a recent trip.

 All it took for Christian Barrett to produce his magnificent portfolio of London's sights was an iPhone and a tilt shift filter on an app

The photos offer a different take on London’s sights – from Buckingham Palace and the London Eye to Canary Wharf and The Shard.

The effects of the filter appear to play a visual trick.

Christian’s photos make the sprawling city look like a miniature model with incredible definition.

The Thames, the O2, Houses of Parliament, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens are rendered almost toy like.

Landmarks such as The Shard, Tower Bridge and the City of London's modern skyline are rendered almost toy like when the filter is applied

Christian Barrett said he managed to photograph London's landmarks from the plane even though he wasn't in a window seat

Christian said: ‘It was a beautiful winter day, the sun was shining and there was a hardly a cloud in the sky.

‘As we came in to land over London the outstanding view was crystal clear and I whipped out my phone to capture the moment.

‘Amazingly, I wasn't even sitting in the window seat and was delighted when I looked back at the images and saw what I had captured.’
