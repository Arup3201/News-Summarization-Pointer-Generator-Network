Mauricio Pochettino believes Charlie Austin and Harry Kane could form a partnership for England in the future.

The pair are both set to start as Spurs travel to Queens Park Rangers on Saturday and are the in-form English strikers in the Premier League.

And Pochettino knows that both could have a future for Roy Hodgson's national team.

'Charlie is a very good player,' he said. 'In football you never know - why not? They're both very good players.'

Tottenham will discuss Kane's workload with the FA in the next month.

Spurs - who insists Emmanuel Adebayor still has a future at the club - would rather Kane has a rest at the end of the season.

But FA technical director Dan Asheprth wants the striker to travel with Gareth Southgate's Under 21s to the Czech Republic for the European Championships as well as turning out for the senior side. 'I always protect the player,' Pochettino added.

Spurs are looking to break into the top four, starting with the trip to Loftus Road - although Pochettino refused to set any targets in terms of points, also suggesting some of the youth team who played against Chelsea on Thursday night could be handed debuts before the end of the season.

'Its not easy because seven or eight teams are fighting for that. We need to go step by step. We're in a good process. My worry now is to improve,' he said.

'We have 11 games to finish the season. It's important to be solid.

'We expect a tough game. They're a strong team. It's a London derby and the three points are important. The squad is fully fit. We need to be ready because it's a difficult game.

'We want to finish the season strong. We have time to work hard now and to be consistent.'
