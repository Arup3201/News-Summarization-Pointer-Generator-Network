Teenagers in Britain still lag far behind their counterparts in the Far East in tests on reading, maths and science, a damning report will show tomorrow.

Worldwide rankings will reveal that the UK has ‘simply stagnated’ since the last analysis four years ago – despite £30billion being poured into education by Labour.

Last night, Education Secretary Michael Gove said the results were a ‘verdict on the last government’ as his reforms had not yet taken effect.

Test results in Britain's schools have not improved in four years despite billions of pounds being spent on improving education

The latest analysis is expected to reveal that Britain’s position has not improved since the previous study in 2009 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

That showed Britain had slumped behind poorer nations such as Poland and Estonia, falling from 17th to 25th in reading, from 24th to 28th in maths and from 14th to 16th in science.

The 2013 analysis is expected to reveal that Britain is still far behind countries such as China, South Korea and Singapore.

The conclusions were based on tests on 500,000 pupils in 65 countries. Mr Gove said: ‘The results due out this week are a verdict on the last government. These tests were taken in 2012 by children educated almost entirely under Labour and before most of our reforms had even been introduced. The real test of our reforms will be how we do in a decade’s time. In the past, these tests have shown that, despite constantly rising exam results, our performance stagnated as others raced ahead.’

Nearly 12,500 students in the UK sat the two-hour problem-solving tests, known as Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), in 477 secondary schools. Britain’s expected poor showing in maths will cause particular  concern and the report will highlight the lack of maths teachers with degrees in their subject.

In the 2009 OECD study, around a fifth of 15-year-olds in Britain failed to gain the minimum standard for their age in literacy and maths.

The Chinese city of Shanghai, which had the top-performing pupils in the tables, scored 600 points to the UK’s 500 in maths.

Former head teacher Sir John Rowling called on schools to give pupils mock PISA papers to improve their chances against bright teenagers abroad.

Michael Gove has said the latest test results will not reflect the changes which have been made under the coalition reforms

The chairman of the Performance in Excellence Club, which helps  schools boost exam results, said: ‘Every test, from driving tests to Oxbridge exams, people prepare for them. But I have never ever known anybody prepare for PISA.’

He told the Times Educational Supplement: ‘Make no mistake – on December 3 the morale of the profession will take another whack around the ears. It is almost certain.’

Yesterday Labour’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt said the report will be a ‘wake-up call for UK schools policy’.

He added that Britain needed to learn from China’s emphasis on good teachers and expectation of good results from every child.

‘All [Michael Gove’s] frenetic, attention-seeking changes have not delivered the step change in standards we need,’ he added.

Alison Wolf, professor of public sector management at King’s  College London, said support for pupils at home was also vital.

‘If you are growing up in Seoul or Shanghai, you go home from school to a family that cares desperately about your education, no matter what its social standing is. British parents are simply not as aware of how important education is.’
