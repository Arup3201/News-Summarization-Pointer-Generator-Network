A tiny 10-month-old pet dog had a miracle escape after she plunged 100ft down a cliff and survived.

Molly, a Norfolk terrier, was being walked off her lead when she bounded off excitedly to explore Old Harry Rocks along Dorset's Jurassic Coast and tumbled off the edge. 

The dog landed on a small patch of shale at the bottom of the cliff and was left stranded, swimming through a cave to a small remote section of beach. 

Here she was only able to be rescued by sea.

A spokesman for Swanage coastguard said: 'The dog had fallen about 100ft but thankfully landed softly.

Rescuers were called and were about to lower a man down the cliff on a rope to rescue Molly when a lifeboat crew arrived. A lifeboatman swam out to get the dog, bringing her back to the safety of the boat.

More than 100 people gathered at the top of the ancient cliffs near Poole to try to help spot Molly after she disappeared over the top of the cliff. 

'The patrol deployed some cliff equipment whilst Poole inshore lifeboat was tasked from another incident to Old Harry.

'The lifeboat soon arrived and located Molly and safely recovered the dog to the boat.

'She was very, very relieved.'

Molly had been off the lead when she fell over the edge of the cliff. 

Her owners have acknowledged they forgot she should have been on the lead at the time.

Rescuers were called to the cliffs at around 3pm on Saturday.

Ed Davies, a helmsman for Poole lifeboat, said when they arrived at Old Harry rocks they saw a large crowd had gathered and that rescuers were about to lower a man down on a rope to get to the animal. 

He said: 'We proceeded to the bottom of the cliff and volunteer crewman Pete Smith got out of the boat and made his way to the beach on the north side of Old Harry.

'He then caught sight of a brown dog - it was Molly. She immediately ran towards him and was very pleased to meet him.

'Pete scooped her up and returned to the lifeboat where the crew gave her a check over and a reassuring stroke.

'Thankfully, Molly seemed fine and none the worse for wear after her dramatic 100ft drop and afternoon dip in the sea below.'

Mr Davies said Mollie had swam through the cave to get to part of the beach where rescuers could reach her. 

He added:  'She is a lucky dog - it was really good for the crew to reunite her with her owner.'
