Alan Pardew says he would welcome Andy Carroll back at Newcastle and hopes to see him one day return to his hometown club.

The West Ham striker is in line to face the Magpies at Upton Park on Saturday afternoon having recovered from the ankle injury he suffered during a summer tour of New Zealand.

It is approaching four years since Carroll sensationally moved from Newcastle to Liverpool in a £35million transfer.

The 25-year-old continues to be linked with a return to St James’ Park and, rather than kill such speculation, Pardew admits it could happen.

‘I think he would (want to come back one day), and I hope he does come back to his hometown,’ said the United boss, who also backed Carroll for an England recall.

‘He has got that love here. I really enjoyed working with Andy. I think he's a terrific player. I know we get linked with him every two weeks, which is always probably going to happen whether it's me or another manager.

‘So I'm not going to hide from the fact that I like him. I'm not sure that it's something that's imminent for us in this window, because he looks fairly happy to me at West Ham.

‘I think it's difficult to take players who are happy out of Premier League teams. It's financially difficult.’

Newcastle, of course, chose to cash in on their academy product when Liverpool laid down a record fee for a British player in January, 2011.

Pardew, though, never felt the move to Anfield was right for the Geordie frontman.

‘I think the Liverpool thing, for me, was a strange one,’ he said. ‘Big Andy's style was against the way they play.

Carroll struggled to make an impact at Liverpool, so went on loan to West Ham, before joining for £15 million

When Carroll returned to Newcastle, some fans held negative banners, but Alan Pardew would love him back

‘He's much more suited to West Ham and I think he's been a big success there, I really do. Actually, if you speak to any West Ham fans, they'll tell you that.

‘The only problem is getting him on the pitch - that's been his biggest issue. If he can have a run, there's no problem with it.

‘He's not just a target man, he's a good footballer and a real presence of the pitch that can win games.’

Carroll missed the bulk of last season with an Achilles problem and has been plagued by injuries since leaving Tyneside. Pardew, however, feels there is no long-term issue.

‘I think Sam (Allardyce) was right in his assessment of Andy - he's sometimes too brave for his own good,’ he added.

‘He's going full-hearted for challenges when he's off-balance. He does that in training as well as in games, so, of course, when you're in a rehab situation he's over-zealous at times purely because he's got that good, football aggression.

‘But I don't think there's anything structurally wrong with him - or a major issue. He's just that type. Duncan Ferguson used to get a lot of injuries. It comes with that role.’

Kevin Nolan, meanwhile, is another player taking on his former club on Saturday. The midfielder skippered the side under Pardew and the Newcastle manager admits that he is indebted to the Scouser.

‘Kevin was brilliant at this football club,’ he said.

‘We owe him a lot - all the players here - with the professionalism he brought and the winning mentality.

‘I would like more Kevin Nolan's in my group.

‘He's a very special sort of person in the changing room, and he brings that to whichever club he goes to, that winning mentality, and that's why he's had such a fantastic career.’
