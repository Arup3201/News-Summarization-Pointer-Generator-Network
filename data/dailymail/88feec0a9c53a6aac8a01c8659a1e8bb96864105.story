It must be hard trying to find a new outfit for every society wedding so it's no wonder Pippa Middleton recycled the furry stole she wore at a ceremony last year.

The Duchess of Cambridge's little sister was attending the wedding of Scottish aristocrats Edmund Salvesen and Abi Elphinstone in Aberdeenshire.

Opinion is divided as to whether it's real or fake fox, but if it is faux, it's extremely convincing.

And it is not the first time the winter warmer has made an appearance.

In December 2012 she wore the stole at the wedding of friend Emma Logue in Northern Ireland to ward off the winter chill. 

This time she channeled a 1920s style for the occasion, with her patterned high necked dress coupled with a purple winter bonnet and clutch bag.

Instead she was instead accompanied by old friend George 
Percy.

Mr Percy - the son of The Duke of Northumberland - has
been previously linked romantically to Pippa.

The elements nearly caught Miss Middleton, dubbed Her Royal Hotness, off guard with the wind whipping up the dress around her toned legs.

Miss Middleton has recently has recently been given a new food column in the Waitrose magazine, Pippa's Friday Night Feasts.

She released her first book - a 
guide to party-planning, which did include several recipes - in October 
last year, but she has since parted ways with her agent.

Celebrate: A Year of British 
Festivities For Families and Friends reportedly netted Pippa a £400,000 
advance from publisher Michael Joseph.

The couple enjoyed a traditional ceremony at their local church

It is believed to be the second outing for the fake fur stole. Miss Middleton was pictured wearing it with a similar outfit to attend a winter wedding last year

But her agent David Godwin last week 
confirmed that he and the middle child of the Middleton family were no 
longer working together.

Miss Middleton also runs her own online magazine, Party Times, an offshoot of her family's Party Pieces business.

She and her partner Nico have been rumoured to have been dating since they met on a ski trip earlier this year.

She has previously dated investment banker James Matthews, 37, and financier and former England cricketer Alex Loudon, 32.

Another weekend, another society wedding for the Duchess of Cambridge’s little sister.  Here Femail’s ELIZA SCARBOROUGH analyses Pippa Middleton’s latest look:

In this sexy, glamorous, yet totally appropriate outfit, Pippa gives us a masterclass on how to dress for a winter wedding.

(Yes, we know it’s supposed to be spring, it’s just that Aberdeenshire, where her friends Edmund Salvesen and Abi Elphinstone tied the knot on Saturday, obviously hadn’t got the memo). 

I don’t think I’ve seen her look this stylish since Kate and William’s big day.

The sleek lines and split of her £578 floor-length, silk Beulah frock flatter her toned legs – and that derrière – while the fluffy tippet adds drama and keeps out the chill. 

Sloanes seem to wed at a rate of knots, so it’s no wonder Pippa recycled the stole, which she wore to another winter wedding, in December 2012.

Opinion is divided as to whether it’s real or fake fox, but if it is faux, it’s extremely convincing.

Fur has been all over the catwalk recently, so Pippa’s obviously been paying attention. The jaunty Gina Foster cocktail hat is a winner too. I love the elegant feather, which is much more stylish than the overblown silk flowers she’s favoured in the past.

The purple dress makes her olive complexion glow, although it could be argued that the matching bangle, clutch bag and suede Prada court shoes are overkill. 

She looks sexy, radiant and grown-up – yet not old beyond her years, which is a fashion trap she’s fallen into in the past. 

She and her mother, Carole, have often been snapped in very similar outfits, which look great on Middleton Senior, but can make 29-year-old Pippa look rather too Sloaney and staid.

No chance of that in this foxy ensemble.
