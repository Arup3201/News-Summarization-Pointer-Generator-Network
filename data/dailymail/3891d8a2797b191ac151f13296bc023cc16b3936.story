Two filmmakers are set to release a documentary demonstrating their attempt to secure an earmark from Congress for a museum dedicated to wasteful government spending.

Ellen and Jim Hubbard of Nevada plan to release Museum of Government Waste later this year to showcase the foolishness of ‘pork barrel’ projects Congress chooses to fund with taxpayer dollars.

The filmmakers take viewers through their five-year journey to obtain public funds by documenting their meetings with members of Congress and several lobbyists.

Pork barrel project: A documentary to be released later this year will detail how a couple attempted to secure funding for a Museum of Government Waste

They embarked on their quest knowing it was highly unlikely they would obtain the earmark.

After a series of frustrating meetings with members of Congress, the filmmakers altered their tactics a bit and mentioned that a wealthy backer had come on board to support the film.

'And once you tell them about a wealthy backer, it was weird,' Ellen Hubbard told The Daily Caller.

'All of them acted the same way. The conversation shifted from "what’s your earmark" to "how can we get this done". It was eye opening.'

In order to not raise any eyebrows in the halls of Congress, the filmmaking duo used hidden cameras.

But you will have to watch the film to find out if they were ultimately successful in their crusade.

Ms Hubbard won’t say whether they managed to secure the earmark.

'I’m not going to tell you because that’s really the point of watching the film,' she told the site.

The couple also secured private money for the project and plan to follow up the film’s release by opening an actual Museum of Government Waste later this year, most probably in Washington DC.

The museum will be operated by David Williams of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance. He also helped fund the film.

'Why not have a space in Washington DC where we could have pictures of members of Congress - a hall of shame,' Mr Williams said to The Daily Caller.

'We could have individual items. We could have tea pots to represent the tea pot museum and have rotating exhibits.'

Radio talk show personality Greg Knapp, a friend of the Hubbards, helped them with their project and also stars in the film.

Congress is notorious for spending public money on questionable pet projects, including $2.5 million in 2010 for potato breeding research programs; $1.79 million in 2008 for pig odor research in Iowa; and $50 million in 2004 for an indoor rainforest in Coralville, Iowa.
