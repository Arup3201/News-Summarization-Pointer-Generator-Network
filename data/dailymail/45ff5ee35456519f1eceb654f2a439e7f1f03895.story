Caleb Moore, an innovative freestyle snowmobile rider who was hurt in a horrific crash at the Winter X Games in Colorado, died on Thursday morning. He was 25.

Moore had been at a hospital in Grand Junction since last week's crash in Aspen. Family spokeswoman Chelsea Lawson confirmed his death.

His family said in a statement: 'He will be truly missed and never forgotten.'

'The family wishes to express their deep gratitude for all the prayers and support they have received from all the fans, friends and family around the world that Caleb has inspired. ... Arrangements for a celebration of life are being made and an announcement will be made in the coming days.'

Passed away: Snowmobiler Caleb Moore died this morning at a hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado

A former all-terrain vehicle racer, 
Moore switched over to snowmobiles as a teenager and didn't take long to
 rise to the top of his sport. He won four Winter X Games medals, 
including a bronze last season when his younger brother, Colten, 
captured gold.

The world of sport paid tribute to the rising star. Motocross star Carey Hart wrote: 'So sad to hear about Caleb Moore. My thoughts go out to his family and friends. Died doing what he loves.'

Jets Quarterback Tim Tebow wrote: 'So sad to hear about the passing of snowmobiler Caleb Moore. My prayers go out to his younger brother Colten & their entire family.'

Olympic snowboarder Gretchen Bleiler tweeted: 'Our world has lost another bright light. Sending my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Caleb Moore.'

Evan Longoria, who plays baseball with the Tampa Bay Rays, wrote on Twitter: 'Tragic day for the family of Caleb Moore. Our deepest sympathies go out to all who he influenced and touched. RIP.'

Austin Dillon, the 2012 NASCAR driver added: 'Just heard about Caleb Moore. I don't know what to say other than I'm praying for his family and friends. He was a true Action Sports Hero.'

Caleb Moore was attempting a back-flip last Thursday in the freestyle event when the skis on his 450-pound snowmobile caught the lip of the landing area, sending him flying over the handlebars.

Moore landed face first into the snow with his snowmobile rolling over him.

Moore stayed down for quite some time, before walking off with help and going to a hospital to treat a concussion.

Moore developed bleeding around his heart and was flown to a hospital 
in Grand Junction for surgery. The family later said that Moore, of 
Krum, Texas, also had a complication involving his brain.

Colten Moore was injured in a separate crash that same night. He suffered a separated pelvis in the spill. He was reportedly released from hospital on Saturday.

B.C.
 Vaught, Caleb Moore's agent for almost a decade, said he first saw 
Moore when he was racing an ATV in Minnesota and signed him up to star 
in some action sports movies.

Later,
 Moore wanted to make the switch from ATVs to snowmobiles and asked 
Vaught to show him how to do a back-flip. In two weeks, Moore mastered 
the difficult maneuver.

Moore's brother also got involved in snowmobiling, the close-knit duo pushing each other to become better.

Way of life: Moore, 25, from Krum, Texas, adored the sport of snow-mobiling

Moore honed his skills in Krum, a 
town about 5,000 people 50 miles northwest of Dallas that rarely sees 
snow. Instead, he worked on tricks by launching his sled into a foam 
pit. After a brief training run on snow ramps in Michigan, he was ready 
for his sport's biggest stage - the 2010 Winter X Games.

In that contest, Moore captured a 
bronze in freestyle and finished sixth in best trick. Two years later, 
his biography on ESPN said: 'Caleb Moore has gone from ''beginner's 
luck'' to `serious threat.'

That was hardly a surprise to Vaught, who said: 'Whatever he wanted to do, he did it.'

Vaught
 said Moore didn't believe his sport was too extreme, but rather 'it was
 a lifestyle'. He was good at it --along with ATV racing - as he 
accumulated a garage full of trophies.

Fellow snowmobile rider Levi LaVallee recently described Moore as a 'fierce competitor'.

'A
 very creative mind,' LaVallee said. 'I've watched him try some crazy, 
crazy tricks and some of them were successful, some of them not so much.

'But he was first guy to get back on a sled and go try it again. It shows a lot of heart.'

The safety of the snowmobile events 
has fallen under scrutiny with several recent accidents and mishaps. In 
addition to the crashes by the Moore brothers, there also was a scary 
scene when a runaway sled veered into the crowd Sunday night after the 
rider fell off during a jump gone wrong.

In
 that incident, snowmobiling newcomer Jackson Strong tumbled off his 
machine during the best trick competition. The throttle stuck on the 
450-pound sled and it swerved straight toward the crowd as fans scurried
 out of the way.

In a statement, X Games officials 
said that they've paid close attention to safety issues during the 
event's 18-year history.

ESPN which organizes X Games told CNN: 'We are deeply saddened by Caleb Moore's passing and our thoughts and prayers go out to his parents, Wade and Michelle, his brother, Colten, and the entire Moore family.

'He will be remembered for his natural passion for life and his deep love for his family and friends, and he will always be an inspiration to everyone he touched in the action sports community.

'As a result of this accident we will conduct a thorough review of this discipline and adopt any appropriate changes to future X Games.'

The network added: 'When the world's best compete at the highest level in any sport, risks remain. Caleb was a four-time X Games medalist attempting a move he has landed several times previously.'

Vaught
 said Moore's only previous injury was a bruised hip that sent him to 
the hospital last year, where he was treated and released.

â€˜In
 sports, everybody makes mistakes, even if it's rare. Caleb made a 
mistake. That's it,â€™ said Vaught, who witnessed Moore's crash.

The
 spills at Winter X weren't just limited to snowmobiles. Rose Battersby 
suffered a lumbar spine fracture in a wipeout on a practice run before 
the skiing slopestyle competition. She was transported to Denver on 
Sunday and had feeling in all extremities, according to X Games 
officials.

Soon after her 
crash, Ashley Battersby, who's not related to Rose, wiped out on the 
course and slid into the fencing. Battersby was down for at least 30 
minutes before being carted off on a sled and taken to a local hospital 
with a knee injury.

Champion: Caleb's brother Colten Moore is also involved in snow-mobiling

There 
also was a bad wipeout in the snowboard big air competition, when 
Halldor Helgason of Iceland suffered a concussion when he over-rotated 
on a flip. He raised his hand to salute the crowd as he was being taken 
off the icy course.

Moore's crash came just over a year after one of the most high-profile deaths in the extreme sports community.

Canadian
 freestyle icon Sarah Burke died January 19, 2012, after sustaining 
irreversible brain damage in a training accident in Park City, Utah. The
 29-year-old was a pioneer in the sport and a driving force behind the 
inclusion of slopestyle and halfpipe skiing at next year's Winter Games 
in Sochi.

Also hurt: Colten Moore, Caleb's little brother, also had to be hospitalized after a crash on Thursday. He suffered a pelvic separation
