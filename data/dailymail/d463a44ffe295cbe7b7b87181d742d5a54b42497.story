Seattle Seahawks star Richard Sherman has condemned those who called him a 'thug' after his adrenalin-fueled, post-game rant on Sunday saying that the word is the 'accepted way of calling somebody the n-word nowadays'.

The corner back, who is on his way to the Superbowl, said on Wednesday that he has done nothing 'villainous' such as be suspended for off-field fighting or arrested - actions that could be considered thug-like behavior.

Sherman has apologized on several occasions for 
verbally attacking San Francisco 49ers running back Michael Crabtree on 
TV after winning the Super Bowl qualifying game. However he condemned those who launched attacks on him with racial undertones.

Seattle Seahawks' Richard Sherman, pictured at a press conference on Wednesday, said that being called a 'thug' was the accepted way to use the 'n-word' nowadays

According to breitbart.com, Sherman told the press conference on Wednesday: 'I know some ''thugs,'' and they know I'm 
the furthest thing from a thug. I've fought that my whole life, just 
coming from where I'm coming from.

'Just because you hear Compton, you hear Watts, you hear cities like that, you just think ''thug, he's a gangster, he's this, that, and the other,'' and then you hear Stanford, and they're like,''oh man, that doesn't even make sense, that's an oxymoron.'''

He added: 'You fight it for so long, and to have it come back up and people start to use it again, it's really, it's frustrating.'

In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, a composed Sherman apologized for the tirade following the SeaHawks 23-17 win over the 49ers in which he played a crucial role with a pass deflection in the end zone that resulted in the game-clinching interception.

After the game, Sherman told ESPN's Erin Andrews: 'Well, I'm the best corner in the game. When you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you're gonna get .... Don't you [Crabtree] ever talk about me! Don't you open your mouth about the best or I'm gonna shut it for you real quick.'

In Wednesday's interview, Sherman said: 'It was really mind-boggling. And it was kind of - it was kind of sad that the way the world reacted - you know, I can't say the world. I don't want to generalize people like that, because there are a lot of great people who didn't react that way.

'But for the people who did react that way and throw the racial slurs and things like that out there, it was really sad.'

He says his behavior has to be seen in the context of playing an intensely competitive sport.

'If you catch me in the moment on the field when I am still in that zone, when I'm still as competitive as I can be and I'm trying to be in the place where I have to be to do everything I can to be successful ... and help my team win, then it's not going to come out as articulate, as smart, as charismatic -- because on the field I'm not all those things,' he said.

But he says there's no excuse for the people who called him a 'thug' and a 'monkey' on Twitter.

'What they did was an actual reality. They showed their true character. Those were real comments, not in a moment, not in a - you know, they had time to think about it. They were sitting at a computer and they expressed themselves in a true way. And I thought society had moved past that.'
