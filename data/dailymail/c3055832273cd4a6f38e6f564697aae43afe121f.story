A widow whose husband, mother and father died within the space of 18 months at Staffordshire hospital angrily confronted staff as thousands staged a demonstration against proposals to downgrade major services.

Wearing a sign that read 'My husband drank out of a case! Where were you then!' Heather Wilhelms had to be restrained by police as she made her feelings known to doctors and nurses who are fighting to save their jobs.

An estimated 30,000 marched from the town centre to the hospital to voice opposition after Mid
 Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust was placed into administration five 
days ago and taken over by a team of managers who will spend 45 days 
deciding its fate.

Heather Wilhelms, whose husband and parents died in Stafford Hospital, was a lone protester among thousands of supporters of the scandal-hit hospital today. A sign pinned to her front read: 'My husband drank out of a vase! Where were you then?'

Heather Wilhelms told the BBC last month that she did not want Stafford Hospital to close

The trust, which runs Stafford and 
Cannock hospitals, has a troubled past and up to 1,200 patients are 
feared to have died needlessly due to poor care between 2005 and 2009.

In
 February, a long-awaited report blamed the disaster on a ‘culture of 
fear’, with managers being more obsessed with meeting targets than 
patient care.

Mrs Wilhelms is one of among nearly 100 bereaved relatives and victims to be paid more than £1 million compensation in the largest ever group claim against a British hospital in 2010.

Speaking to the Telegraph at the time, she told how doctors failed to notice her mother Pauline Nicklin, 71, had two cancerous tumours on her ovaries for two years before she died in 2006.

Nine months later, her father Percy went to the hospital with a deadly foot infection, but was sent home without treatment.

Convinced something was wrong, Mrs Wilhems took him back where he was diagnosed with blood poisoning and gangrene and died four days later aged 76.

Her husband Tom was also treated at the hospital before he died from a lethal lung disease but Mrs Wilhelms again complained of appalling conditions.

Thousands of campaigners marched from the town's Market Square to protest against the removal of major services from Stafford Hospital

Hospital staff joined protesters on the march in support of the hospital, run by the scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust

The Trust was put into administration this week - only the second time this has happened in the NHS

She said: 'They went into that 
hospital to get the treatment and care to make them better. Instead, one
 by one, they came out of that place in their coffins.'

Despite
 her horrific experiences at Stafford hospital, last month Mrs Wilhelms 
told the Midlands Express and Star that she did not want to see it 
close.

She said: 'People do not want Stafford Hospital to close and I don’t want it to close.

'Although I do think there needs to be a clean sweep. They need to bring someone in to sort it out once and for all.'

Campaigners
 of all ages today packed into the Market Square in Stafford for the 
rally and mile-long march to the hospital, with many holding placards 
and banners showing their opposition to the withdrawal of services 
including maternity care from the hospital.

A public inquiry found that it had 
provided 'appalling' standards of care and caused unnecessary suffering 
to hundreds of patients over a five-year period up to 2009.

Sue Hawkins, chair of the Support Stafford Hospital group, said today that it was important to move on from the past.

'I think we've got to talk about 2013,' she said.

'What happened, happened. The numbers 
will be debatable but what we've got to do is move forward and look to 
the future for our community.

'We've got a safe hospital today and we're looking to the future.

'We need to have an Intensive Care 
Unit here, we need to have an Accident and Emergency 24 hours a day and 
we believe that's possible.

'We know there have to be changes, we know there may have to be some alliance with another hospital to achieve that.'

The march was organised by the Support Stafford Hospital campaign group, which is fighting cuts to major services, including accident and emergency, at the hospital

The Stafford Brigade marching band, in campaign T-shirts, joined the protesters as they chanted on the route to the hospital

Many of those at the demonstration, 
including hospital workers, community groups and political 
representatives, said there was hope for the hospital.

Heidi Fligg, 46, said: 'People never appreciate anything until it's gone.

'I've had family and friends that have survived all sorts through Stafford and I just say it needs our support.

'We're not the only hospital suffering, I appreciate that, but why should we be the scapegoat for every other hospital?'

Admin
 worker Jo Van Derwyk, 46, said she had given birth to four babies at 
Stafford Hospital - the youngest is now five and the eldest nearly 21 - 
and had only good experiences then and since.

She
 said: 'Stafford is a large town and it needs its hospital, it needs all
 its acute services, its emergency services and its maternity services.'

Another
 supporter, Brian Henderson, said: 'As you can see today, the sense of 
feeling that people want services locally is immense.'
