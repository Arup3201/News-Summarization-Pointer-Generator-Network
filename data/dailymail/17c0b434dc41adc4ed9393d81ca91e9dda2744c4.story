Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law has been earning a six-figure salary from her role heading a charity intended to help women in political campaigns abroad.

Marjorie Margolies, the mother of Chelsea's husband Marc Mezvinsky, is a Democrat currently running for Congress in Pennsylvania and the financial statements for her charity, Women's Campaign International (WCI), have come under scrutiny as such.

As the charity has grown over the past decade, so has her salary as The Huffington Post reports it has steadily increased from $54,962 in 2002 to the highest point in 2011 when she took home $164,159.

Her salary dipped last year- to $109,678 in 2012- and she has not taken any salary this year.

Instead, the former Congresswoman, who served one term before being voted out in 1995, has turned her attention back to the political arena as she is now actively campaigning in her own tight race against three other Democrats.

That isn't to say that she has cut ties to the charity, as she regularly posts updates on her Twitter account, publicizing events that they are holding.

One such recent evening came in November when she honored her famous daughter-in-law at the 15th anniversary bash for the charity.

'Thrilled to be honored last night by Women's Campaign International & even more grateful for the work they do around the world,' Chelsea wrote to her Twitter followers.

That work includes programs focused on conflict mitigation, economic empowerment and political participation in Sri Lanka, Liberia and Malawi respectively.

Like many charities, fundraising efforts for WCI ebb and flow along the lines of economic prosperity, meaning that the annual budget for the charity is variable year to year.

That helps explain some of the spikes and dips in Ms Margolies' salary, but The Huffington Post points to the fact that even in their more economically-prosperous years, her take-home pay would have been a slightly higher than average percentage of the group's expenses than standard throughout the industry.

Ms Margolies' spokesman Ken Smukler responded to their article after publication, defending her pay over time and saying that she was paid less than the industry average for heads of non-profits- which is thought to be $94,924- when looking at her pay over the past decade rather than the past few years.

'The vote': Back in 1993, hers was one of the deciding votes that passed then-President Clinton's budget plan that increased taxes for the wealthy, and that caused her to be voted out

'For six of the twelve years Marjorie has been leading WCI, her salary has been significantly lower than the industry standard. In 2013 Marjorie has, in fact, taken no salary at all,' he wrote to The Huffington Post.

He blasted the reporter, Laura Goldman, for 'creating the false impression that marjorie has somehow used wci to line her pockets'.

Adding to the fundraising climates in particular years, the WCI also receives grants- the budgets for which are at the whims of their own ties to the economy.

'Some years we are implementing multiple grants and all efforts are on program implementation and other times our staff efforts are on fundraising and proposal writing to secure more funding for projects.

One of those grants- for $127,076- came directly from the State Department in 2011.

That hefty grant comes as little surprise to political watchers, as Ms Margolies had a significant connection to the State Department at the time, and one who is a very big proponent of female empowerment work abroad: Hillary Clinton, her son's mother-in-law, was the Secretary of State at the time.

Now that connection may be problematic for Clinton should she take her widely-predicted role as the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, as more questions will be raised about what portion of WCI's funding actually goes towards the programs they tout.

MailOnline's efforts to reach out to Ms Margolies' campaign and WCI were not immediately returned.

In addition to her work with the WCI, Ms Margolies teaches at the University of Pennsylvania.

She first ran for Congress in 1992, when she was known as Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and was married to former U.S. Representative Edward Mezvinsky, an Iowa Democrat who went on to become the party's state chairman in Pennsylvania.

He went to prison in 2003 after he plead guilty to 31 out of 69 counts of bank, mail and wire fraud where he defrauded investors of $10million.

She stood by him for the first four years of his federal prison sentence before divorcing him in 2007, just one year before he was released.

Margolies, who is now 71 years old, made a name for herself on a number of different fronts before her husband went to prison and decades before her son married a First Daughter.

She was the first single American woman to adopt a foreign child, an experience that became the subject of her first book.

And on August 5, 1993, during her term in Congress, Margolies-Mezvinsky cast one of the two final votes that gave Clinton's budget a dramatic victory in the House, 218-216.

Just hours before she voted, she told a reporter she would oppose the bill, but she changed her mind after a phone call with Clinton minutes before the vote.

Her 1994 challenger, Jon Fox, focused his campaign rhetoric on that decision, and voters in the wealthy district turned against her.

In 2010, her son Marc married Chelsea Clinton and she said that she was very happy for the couple, who began dating five years earlier after meeting at a Democratic political retreat in South Carolina in 1993.

‘I’m totally delighted to be Chelsea Clinton’s mother-in-law; she’s a doll,’ she said at the time.
