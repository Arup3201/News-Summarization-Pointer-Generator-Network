Police led to a shallow grave by cadaver dogs in the hunt for missing Utah mother Susan Powell called off the search after they found charred wood that may have been used to burn human remains.

At the spot just 30 miles from where Susan's husband Josh said he took their children on the night she disappeared that police had been digging through, they found about 100 pieces of wood which had traces of human decomposition on them.

Police said they believe it may have been the site of a crime scene once and were unable to say if the remains belonged to the missing mother-of-two.

Disappearance: Susan Cox Powell, a mother of two young children, was reported missing on December 7, 2009, when she was aged 28

West Valley City Lt Bill Merritt said: 'There’s a very good possibility that this at one point 
or another was a crime scene. Whether it’s linked to ours, we 
don’t know.'

The dogs picked up a scent in the desert
two days ago and they have been digging at the spot since. They then 
found the shallow grave.

A state anthropologist - an expert on
digging up human remains - was brought in to help serach the spot but 
police are confident that they won't find any more and have stopped 
excavation.

A forensic specialist will now examine the wood.

'We are very disappointed, we are frustrated,' Lt 
Merritt told The Salt Lake Tribune of Saturday’s outcome after days of effort at the dig site. 'We were 
hoping that this would be the answer everyone was looking for.'

Susan Powell disappeared from her 
West Valley City home on 7 December, 2009. Her husband is the only named
person of interest in the case but has never been charged or arrested.

He said he took his young sons, then 
four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am. He 
believes his wife ran off with another man.

Cadaver dogs led police to the 
grave site on Wednesday just off a dirt road near the base of Topaz 
Mountain, a popular rock-hounding spot in remote central Utah.

They claimed to have found human remains but later said it was a false alarm.

Susan Powell's father, Chuck Cox, said he had long-believed the search for his daughter would be a lengthy process.

'There's no real false hope, it's 
just another step in the investigation,' he told Fox. 'Every day is hard
for the family. Life goes on, and so you go on the best you can. It's 
something you have to live with.'

‘It's a game of patience at this 
point,’ a local police spokesman said. ‘We need to slow down a little 
bit and identify what it is we found.’

Mrs Powell, then 28, went missing after failing
to show up for her stockbroker job. She was seen by friends at church 
and dinner the day before.

Concerns: Josh Powell, husband of Mrs Powell, is under a cloud of suspicion in her disappearance as he is the only person of interest in the case

Last month investigators searched mine shaft-dotted mountains near Ely, Nevada.

In addition, West Valley City police served a search warrant on the Puyallup, Washington, home Mr Powell shares with his father.

They seized computers and journals thought to have belonged to her. Mr Powell said he will not be commenting on the body’s discovery.

This latest search is in an area popular for gem and rock hunters. Police have said Mrs Powell's husband liked to rock hunt in the area.

Mrs Powell's father, Chuck Cox, said he is not sure the remains are his daughter’s - as the search area is a very deserted place.

‘I'm sure there are people who have died in the desert that nobody knows about,’ he told NBC.

'It's gone from just bizarre to just unbearable for the family'

The case has caused a major feud 
between the Cox and Powell families - with the latter claiming Mrs 
Powell ran off with another man, reported MSNBC.

Steve
Powell, Mr Powell’s father, sensationally claimed last month he had a 
flirtatious relationship with his daughter-in-law and they were in love.

But
this was denied by her parents and Cox family lawyer Anne Bremner, who 
claimed the Powells had gone from ‘bizarre to just unbearable’.

Mrs
Powell’s family won a court restraining order last month, which means 
Josh Powell and Chuck Cox must not come within 500ft of each other.
