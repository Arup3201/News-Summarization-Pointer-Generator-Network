A passing motorist who saw an overturned truck engulfed in flames threw rocks to smash its windshield and ultimately free the driver trapped inside.

Larry Coulter told WIVB that he was hauling a load of stones on Monday on the Thruway near Buffalo, New York when one of his tires blew, sending his truck into a guardrail and overturning.

The guardrail punctured the fuel tank, igniting a fire that quickly spread threw the truck.

With the vehicle's cab on its side, the only door available for Coulter to climb through had been overcome by flames and he quickly realized there was no escape.

Terrifying: A burning truck can be seen on the side of the Thruway near Buffalo on Monday. Its driver was saved after a passing motorist threw rocks at the windshield, cracking it and letting him escape

'The tires were bursting all around me,' he said. 'I just kept thinking it was the end.'

He tried to kick out the windshield but the thick smoke made the effort impossible, WIVB reported.

Suddenly, a car pulled in front of the truck and its driver, Ed Brunner, jumped out. He attempted to smash the window with a metal bar - but the heat was too much.

So instead, he grabbed concrete rocks that had fallen from the truck and started throwing them.

To Coulter's disbelief, the man managed to crack the windshield enough for him to kick his way out.

'That guy should have been a professional football player or something,' Coulter said. 'It was just unbelievable.'

On footage taken by another passing motorist, Ed Brunner's gray car can be seen, left, in front of the burning truck. The trapped driver, Larry Coulter, thought he was going to die before he saw Brunner approach

Brunner then helped the relieved driver escape. He left the scene before fire crews arrived on the scene and Coulter has not seen his 'guardian angel' since.

Coulter, a married father-of-two, was taken to the Erie County Medical Center where he was treated for smoke inhalation.

'He saved my life,' Coulter said of Brunner. 'I owe him eternal gratitude.' 

But Brunner told WIVB that he's no hero.

'I did it because I saw another man who needed my help,' he said. 'God put me there for a reason.'
