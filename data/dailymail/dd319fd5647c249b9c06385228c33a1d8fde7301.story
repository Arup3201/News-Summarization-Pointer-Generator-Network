The Queen today paid tribute to her Irish hosts as she chose a bright green dress and coat for her meeting with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness. 

Her apple green outfit, a dress, hat and matching coat decorated with gold embroidery, was designed expressly for the visit by her in-house couturier Angela Kelly.

One of the Queen's most trusted aides, Kelly has worked for the Queen for 20 years and now holds the lofty title of Personal Assistant, Adviser and Curator to Her Majesty the Queen (Jewellery, Insignias and Wardrobe).

Sensitive choice: The Queen's outfit was well chosen given the nature of her visit

She designed the majority of the Queen's outfits for the Jubilee celebrations, including the splendid white crystal-studded coat, dress and hat worn by the Queen for the Thames pageant. 

Along with her Angela Kelly outfit, 
the Queen wore gloves by royal warranted glove-maker Genevieve Lawson. 
On her lapel, she wore the 38-diamond Frosted Sunflower brooch - another nod to the purpose of her visit given the flower's association as a symbol of peace.

Politically, the Queen's choice of outfit today was a wise one, given the sensitive nature of her visit.

The
monarch's sartorial nod to the nation's colour echoed similiar moments 
in May last year, when she was seen on two separate occasions wearing 
vivid green outfits during a four day relationship-building state visit 
to the Republic of Ireland.

On her coat the Queen pinned the Frosted Sunflower brooch, another nod to the purpose of her visit to Ireland given the sunflower's association as a symbol of peace. Her spectacular hat was also created by Angela Kelly

The colour green is significant in Ireland's history

The colour green has long been associated with Ireland - indeed the country is often referred to as the Emerald Isle. 

The colour appears on the Republic of Ireland flag, along with white and the Protestant orange.

The Irish government has described the green as representing the Gaelic tradition of Ireland, orange representing the followers of William of Orange in Ireland, and white representing the peaceful truce between them.

It is also the colour most strongly associated with St Patrick's day celebrations.
