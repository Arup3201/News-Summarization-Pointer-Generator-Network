A blood test after her death revealed that Kirsten Thompson, 56, did not have HIV, and neither did her husband Bruce

A woman killed herself because she thought she had infected her husband with the Aids virus, an inquest has heard.

But a blood test revealed after her death that Kirsten Thompson, 56, did not have HIV, and neither did her husband Bruce.

Friend Valeri Menneer told the hearing that Mrs Thompson suffered from anxiety and was worried when Bruce fell ill.

She
said: 'She thought she may have given him HIV. She was always very 
aware of the symptoms she had - that it might be something much bigger 
than it was.

'She said she had a relationship a long 
time ago with a man who had been to Venezuela, and thought she might 
have caught HIV from him.'

Soon after taking the blood test, Mrs
Thompson, of Crowcombe in Somerset, killed herself in a cow shed in a 
field near her home. A shotgun was found near her body.

Her husband said: 'She was a hypochondriac and worried about everything.'

She died from severe chest trauma consistent with a double-barrelled shotgun discharge.

West Somerset coroner Michael Rose recorded a suicide verdict.

He
said that Mrs Thompson had found happiness in her marriage in September
2010, 11 months before her death, adding: 'This death was quite 
unnecessary.'
