The reputation of Boeing’s Dreamliner took another blow when a passenger on one of the aircraft spotted fuel gushing from the wing as it taxied for take-off.

The Norwegian Airlines 787 was preparing to take off from Bangkok on a journey to Oslo on Sunday when passenger Ann Kristin Balto saw that fuel was leaking on to the runway.

She immediately alerted a stewardess and the flight was cancelled.

She told The Local: ‘We started to point out the window, so that the the stewardess became aware of it, and she looked out of the window and picked up the phone. I don’t know who she called but the plane stopped immediately afterwards.’

A Norwegian spokesman told Reuters that the leak was caused by a problem with a fuel valve.

Norwegian's press spokesman Charlotte Holmbergh Jacobsson told The Local that passengers were never in danger because the fuel leak would have registered on the pilots' instrument panel.

Passengers were taken off the plane, which was taken out of service. The flight departed 19 hours later and the jet was later sent to a maintenance facility in Stockholm.

Norwegian said it did not have more detail about the problem because Boeing is responsible for maintenance of the airline's 787 fleet.

Boeing said it was working with Norwegian Air on the issue.

Norwegian has admitted that the reliability of its 787 fleet has not been satisfactory

The 787 Dreamliner model of US aircraft producer Boeing has suffered a series heightened safety concerns, which led airlines all over the world to temporarily ground their Dreamliner fleets in 2013

For every 100 Dreamliner flights, three are unable to leave on time due to mechanical issues with the plane.

The incident is one of a number of problems that 787 operators have experienced with Boeing's newest jetliner. Just over a year after the 787 began commercial operation in late 2011, the worldwide fleet was grounded in January 2013 after lithium-ion batteries overheated on two 787 jets in less than two weeks.

In October, Norwegian Chief Executive Bjorn Kjos praised the jet's flying performance and fuel efficiency, but expressed concern that the airline was forced to take one of the new $200 million jets out of service for two weeks and lease an alternative jet because of problems with a hydraulic pump.Boeing redesigned the pump to solve the problem.

Last week, a battery melted and emitted smoke from a parked 787 Dreamliner operated by Japan Airlines. The incident at Tokyo Narita airport caused the jet to be taken out of service.

The fuel leak on the Norwegian jet in Bangkok, and other incidents, have combined to lower the plane's ability to consistently depart on time on scheduled flights. Most older aircraft are highly reliable, able to leave the gate on time more than 99 percent of the time.

In October, Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney said the company was ‘making good progress’ on improving the reliability of the 787, but that he was not yet satisfied with the performance, which was about 97 per cent on time.

That means for every 100 flights, three are unable to leave on time due to mechanical issues with the plane.

Norwegian did not provide a reliability level, but spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said that recently the ‘overall reliability of our 787 fleet has not been satisfactory.’
