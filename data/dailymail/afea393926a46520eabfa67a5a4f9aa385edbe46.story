WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could remain holed up inside Ecuador’s embassy in London for a year as he believes the case against him in Sweden will be dropped.

The 41-year-old Australian, who faces arrest and extradition over alleged sexual offences if he sets foot outside the building in Knightsbridge, insisted that he believes that he will walk out a free man.

In a TV interview broadcast in Ecuador, Assange said he believed it would take between 'six and 12 months' for the issue to be resolved.

Pledge: Assange has sought political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and says he believes it will take up to 12 months to resolve his situation

His comments follow Foreign Secretary William Hague’s admission that 'a solution is not in sight' to the row which has strained diplomatic relations with the South American country.

Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador after seeking sanctuary in the country’s diplomatic mission in June.

In an interview inside the embassy, he told Telesur he believed the issue 'will be solved through diplomacy', the BBC reported.

Assange added: 'The Swedish government could drop the case. I think this is the most likely scenario. Maybe after a thorough investigation of what happened they could drop the case.

'I think this will be solved in between six and 12 months. That’s what I estimate.'

Crowded: Hundreds of supporters, journalists and police officers filled the Knightsbridge street to listen to Assange speak earlier this month, and it appears he is there for the long haul

Ecuador has claimed that Britain threatened to storm its embassy after Foreign Official highlighted available powers to enter the building and make the arrest, an assertion strenuously denied by Mr Hague.

The Foreign Secretary said yesterday: 'This may go on for a long time so we are not making a threat against the embassy of Ecuador.'

While talks aimed at finding a way of ending the stand-off would continue, he added: 'Given Ecuador’s position on what they call diplomatic asylum and our very clear legal position, such a solution is not in sight at the moment.'

It came just days after the Argentine ambassador in London accused the UK of violating international law in its 'arrogant' approach to the case of Julian Assange.

Alicia Castro, who only took up her post earlier this year, said the diplomatic handling of attempts to extradite the Wikileaks founder showed similarities to the UK's attitude to the Falkland Islands.

A former air stewardess and union official, Ms Castro is known for her nationalistic stance and is a close confidante of President Cristina Kirchner.

Speaking of the Assange case in an interview with an Argentine radio station, she said: 'For us Argentines, this fact [sic], that shows us the arrogance of British diplomacy, does not surprise us.

'It is very similar to the approach taken toward the Malvinas Islands [the Argentine name for the Falklands]. London is being urged by the United Nations to negotiate and participate in dialogue with Argentina.'

Ms Castro also revealed that she met 
Assange at the embassy with other Latin American leaders last Friday 
while listening to a live transmission from Washington of a meeting of 
foreign ministers from the OAS to discuss the inviolability of embassy 
and consular premises.
