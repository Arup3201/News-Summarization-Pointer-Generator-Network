Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has admitted he made a mistake in appointing Neil Warnock as the club's manager at the start of the season.

With Warnock now sacked, and Alan Pardew soon to be announced as the Eagles' manager after leaving Newcastle, Parish spoke to former player Mark Bright for the club's official YouTube channel.

'History will judge (whether the time was right for Warnock to leave). We're one game in to him not being here. I know people say it, Neil is a very nice guy, a really nice guy. I would have loved him to be a success.

'In the maelstrom that was going on then, I probably wanted to get someone in too much. I felt that what we had here (when Tony Pulis left) we could just keep going. 

'And I didn't see anyone out there at the time that I wanted to make a three or four year commitment to, and Neil was prepared to come in and do it on a slightly shorter-term basis and help out. It felt the right thing to do and I don't think we're massively behind where we should be.'

Despite that, Palace are holders of one of the relegation places in the Premier League. Three wins in their first 20 matches sees them three points off bottom, and Parish was honest in his assessment that the time was right to sack Warnock.

'I just think that we were drifting away from what we're good at. And I don't think it's the time to change things [on the pitch]. We tried to play a different formation [against] Southampton and I felt we looked a bit lost at sea at times, the crowd went flat. It's difficult then to dig yourself out of that.

'Things haven't gone so well, with Tony [Pulis] going just before the start of the season, it causes upheaval. I probably didn't get the right fit with Neil, I've gotta take it on the chin for that one.' 

Last season, it didn't start smoothly for Palace either. Ian Holloway was in charge for the beginning of the 13/14 campaign, and it took a managerial change to kick-start things and instill some belief into the squad. This season, Parish admits, it is Burnley who have reaped the rewards of an increase in confidence.

'Burnley have got a few results. That happened to us last season, the belief grows. Tony came in and galvanised everyone around. His style fitted with our players and he did a great job. The players did a great job, the whole place was lifted, it was amazing.

'That Liverpool game (when Palace drew 3-3 in May), it was the first game I was really relaxed. I remember going 3-0 down and sitting next to you (Mark Bright) on my phone and thinking, "well, it's not great is it?". Then Damo (Damien Delaney) loses track of where he was, and tries to cross it...

'When Yala (Yannick Bolasie) breaks past Glen Johnson, it's just... and the place was electric. So yeah, the season was great. But like I said to you before, I don't look back really, it's pointless. Enjoy it, celebrate it, then try and move on.'

And Palace have moved on. Parish cracked the whip and another manager has been pushed out of the exit door at the club's Beckenham training ground. 

Despite their league position, there have been highlights, including a 3-1 win against Liverpool at Selhurst Park

Luis Suarez was in tears on the pitch as Crystal Palace came back from three down to draw 3-3 with Liverpool

It wasn't a decision that Parish made lightly; in fact, he doesn't make any decisions at the click of a finger. 

'I don't just roll the dice, "oh lets just do that then"', the Palace chief continued. 'I really agonise over everything, chat to Stephen [Browett - Parish's co-chairman] about things endlessly, try and work out the best thing to do. We've got to make more right decisions than the rest of them to catch up. 

'I'm pretty tough nut with things like that. You make decisions in football to create emotions. Right now I think we need a lift, we need something to lift the place. There's a real sense that we might lose something we've got, and the Premier League is such a fantastic place to be and we want to stay there. 

'It's about tapping into those emotions to get the sense of what people feel. It shouldn't be knee-jerk.'

So, starting with a trip to Dover in the FA Cup on Sunday, it is now the job of Pardew to steady the Selhurst ship. As Parish says, Palace need a lift... and Pardew, who was at the club's Beckenham training ground on Friday, may just be the man to sort it.
