He is also accused of perverting the course of justice by disposing of his alleged victim’s body.

In the dock: Speculation that Jayden Parkinson may have been pregnant emerged after Ben Blakeley, 22, was brought before magistrates in Oxford accused of murdering her and disposing of her body

Missing: 17-year-old Jayden Parkinson went missing on December 3 and hasn't been seen for nearly two weeks. Police have now charged Ben Blakeley, a 22-year-old man from Reading, with her murder

Search: More than 100 officers are searching an area near Upton, Oxfordshire, but say the searches of an area of farmland could continue for 'days' as the force works to discover what has happened to the teenager

Help: Superintendent Christian Bunt thanked the public for their help with the inquiry so far, but urged people not to carry out their own searches for Jayden (pictured) who was last seen leaving Didcot railway station

Jayden was last seen at Didcot railway
station at 4.30pm on December 3 after leaving a youth hostel in Oxford.

The police investigation has centred on a man seen dragging a heavy 
canvas suitcase through Didcot on the day she vanished.

Specialist
search teams using dogs and backed by a helicopter continue to scour 
farmland just outside the nearby village of Upton as they hunt for a 
body.

A 17-year-old boy, who
cannot be named for legal reasons, was yesterday charged with 
perverting the course of justice. He is accused of assisting in the 
disposal of Jayden’s body.

In a statement issued after Jayden's 
former boyfriend appeared in court accused of murder, Detective Chief 
Superintendent Andy Murray said: 'During the course of the investigation
there has been some suggestion that Jayden may be pregnant.

'At this time we simply don't have any way of confirming whether this is correct or not.'

As
searches to trace the teenager continued at several locations in the 
Didcot area of Oxfordshire, the senior officer added: 'Our priority at 
this time is to find Jayden.'

Blakeley,
of Christchurch Road, Reading, was ordered to reappear at Oxford Crown 
Court today, when the youth will appear before a special sitting of 
the city's youth court.

The
17-year-old youth spoke only to confirm his personal details to the 
court clerk during a 25-minute appearance before three magistrates this 
afternoon.

The teenager was originally arrested last Friday by detectives investigating Jayden's disappearance.

Specialist
search teams backed by helicopters and police dogs have been attempting
to locate Jayden, who was last seen at about 4.30pm on December 3.

Throughout
the weekend, police carried out a detailed search of an area of 
farmland just outside the village of Upton, near Didcot, where they appear to be focusing their efforts on a small patch of woodland near the church.

Commenting
on the extensive search operation, Mr Murray said: 'We now have a 
number of locations where police activity is taking place, mainly in the
Didcot and Upton area.

'All of this activity will understandably disrupt and worry the local community.

'Our
priority is to find Jayden, and as you can imagine with all of the 
media attention, we have received a lot of useful information which has 
led us to focus our attention on these areas.

'The
public is asked to be patient and, as we said yesterday, to refrain 
from carrying out their own searches as it could jeopardise police 
work.'

Thanking the media 
and the public for their help during the inquiry so far, Mr Murray 
added: 'We are doing everything we can, working tirelessly round the 
clock, to find where Jayden is.'

In a heartfelt plea, her mother 
Samantha Shrewsbury posted a message on social media site Facebook 
saying: 'My baby, my princess, my heart is so heavy, baby girl.

'I just want to see you walk through my door with a "ta-dar".

'I need you little lady, my heart feels so empty without you.'

The
police's inquiry team has now grown to more than 100 officers and 
Superintendent Christian Bunt said the existing searches could continue 
for 'days' as the force works to discover what has happened to the 
teenager.

Mr Bunt, 
Oxfordshire police commander, said officers were also continuing to 
search a grassy area of wasteland in the Lydalls Road area of Didcot.

Residential addresses have also been searched and a recycling bin was earlier removed for further examination.

Mr
Bunt thanked the public for their help with the inquiry so far, but 
urged people not to carry out their own searches as these could prove a 
risk to the ongoing police investigation.

He
added it was the complete lack of any contact or activity from Jayden -
she has not used her mobile phone or bank account since going missing -
that had led detectives to believe she may have been killed.

Suitcase: As officers continue the search, police believe a young man seen struggling with a suitcase in the area on December 9 could hold the key to the investigation and are focusing on tracing the man

Disappeared: The teenager, who had recently left home in Didcot to live in Oxford, failed to return to the city on the evening of December 3, as planned and officers are now searching farmland as part of the investigation

Operation: Police have continued a detailed search of an area of farmland just outside Upton, near Didcot

The
teenager, who had recently left home in Didcot to live in Oxford, 
failed to return to the city on the evening of December 3, as planned.

Police
have pieced together her movements in the run-up to her disappearance, 
and believe she walked up Oxford's High Street through the town centre, 
arriving at the train station at 4.07pm, where she then boarded a train 
to Didcot.

The very last sighting of her is when she left Didcot railway station at about 4.27pm.

Detective
Chief Superintendent Andy Murray said police were focused on tracing a 
man seen with a large suitcase in a field in the small village of Upton 
in the early hours of December 9.

He
said: 'That suitcase was large, it was heavy, it was difficult to 
manage and that man was having difficulty removing that suitcase from 
that area.'

Mr Murray said the same man with the suitcase was seen in Didcot about half an hour later.He is described as about 20, white, about 5ft 6in, of medium to slim build, with short dark hair.

The suitcase was about 3ft by 2ft, about 15in deep and light coloured, probably made of canvas material.

Mr Bunt added: 'I would like to thank the public firstly as there's a huge amount of information coming in and a lot of vital lines of enquiry we are following. Please keep that information forthcoming,' he said.

'We have got two significant search areas at the moment.

'We continue to focus on the area in Upton just outside of Didcot and we understand that is having a big impact on the local community.

'It's quite an extensive search area and we have got lots of officers there and we now have a fairly significant search area in the Lydalls Road area of Didcot.

'We've got a lot of resources attached to the operation, over 100 officers, specialist search and investigative officers and it's also important to mention we have specialist officers with the family supporting them.'

Jayden is white, of slim build, with shoulder-length dark brown hair and brown eyes.

When last seen, she was wearing light-blue faded jeans, a brown hooded top with red lettering on it, a black waist-length jacket, and dark trainers
