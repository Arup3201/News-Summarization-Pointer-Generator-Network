Three Indonesian drug smugglers caught with 47 times the amount of heroin trafficked by the Bali Nine will be eligible for release from an Australian jail within three years.

Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are facing execution in Indonesia this month for their role in the 2005 plot to smuggle 8.3kg of the drug to Australia, with reports fighter jets have arrived in Bali to escort the two men to their deaths.

But three Indonesian men convicted of trying to import 389kg of heroin into Australia, who were caught by Australian not Indonesian authorities, are preparing to be released and will be allowed to return home to Indonesia, Fairfax reported.

In October 1998, Krist Tito Mandagi, Saud Siregar and Sidiki Ismunandar were intercepted near Port Macquarie on the NSW mid north coast on a vessel carrying more than $600 million worth of heroin in black sports bags.

The trio have served their time at Lithgow Correctional Facility in NSW in their own cell with a shower and toilet, where they have had access to gym facilities and have been able to earn $40 a week in prison jobs – a stark contrast to the overcrowded cells of Bali's Kerobokan Prison where Chan and Sukumaran have languished for nearly a decade.

Their vessel was intercepted at Grants Beach in North Haven after leaving from the Andaman Sea near the Thai-Burma border in August 1998. When weighed it was found the heroin powder on board contained 252kg of pure heroin.

In the NSW District Court, the boat's captain Mandagi received a life sentence with a non-parole period of 25 years.

In an appeal his non-parole period was shortened to 19 years, and he will be eligible for parole on October 13 2017. If released he will be flown back to Indonesia where he will be reunited with his wife and son.

Siregar and Ismunandar can apply for parole in 2018.

In a 2012 interview with Indonesian magazine Tempo, Ismunandar conceded he was treated well at the maximum security Lithgow prison where he enjoyed the gym facilities and could work and earn $40 per week.

But in the same interview Ismunandar also complained that he had not been shown mercy by Australian authorities while Indonesian authorities had granted clemency to Schapelle Corby – who was convicted of smuggling 4.2kg of marijuana into Bali.

'If only the Indonesian government had urged the Australian government to forgive us instead of cutting Corby's sentence, then I'd be a free man,' he said.
