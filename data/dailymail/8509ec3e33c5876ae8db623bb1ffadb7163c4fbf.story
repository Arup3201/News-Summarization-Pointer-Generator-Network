The Sydney teenager who had his head speared by a metal bar by an angry gatecrasher, has said that no punishment his attacker could receive can compare to his own life sentence.

Liam Knight, 18, underwent five hours of life-saving surgery and is still undergoing rehabilitation after a gatecrasher threw a three-metre long metal bar at him at a friend's party in January last year.

In a victim-impact statement read by his brother Shane at his attacker's sentence hearing, Liam told Sydney's District Court that the night has 'left my life in tatters'.

'I had to re-learn how to speak ... it's distressing not to be physically strong and able,' his brother read out on Friday.

Liam, who now uses a walking aid, said he now feels self-conscious.

'I feel that people are looking down on me.

'People no longer see me as Liam but as a person who need help.'

He is now unsure of his future in terms of career, being able to live alone and having relationships because of his attacker, who is known only as DS.

'DS has changed my whole life for the simple fact that he couldn't get into a party.'

No punishment for DS could 'compete with the life sentence that I have been given,' he said.

Liam was one of about 70 guests celebrating Harry Staples' 18th birthday in Forestville in Sydney's north on January 11, 2013.

The then 17-year-old DS, arrived at the 18th birthday party at about 11pm before being told to leave because he wasn't invited, the court was previously told.

He then scaled the home's six-metre fence and climbed onto the roof of a shed. Angry and intoxicated, he began throwing building materials at partygoers.

A three-metre 'rebar' pierced Liam's skull and became lodged in his head, causing permanent brain damage.

Liam was sedated by paramedics and firefighters were called in to cut the steel rod, before he was rushed to Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital.

Sydney's District Court also heard from Philip Staples, the father in charge of the 18th birthday party that was the scene of the horrific crime.

Mr Staples told the court he had a 'deep sense of sadness and failure' at being unable to protect his son's friend Liam from his lifelong injuries.

After hearing this, DS took the stand and cried as he said, 'no words can describe how sorry I am'.

'I had no right to act the way I did,' the teen said.

The court heard DS had been on bail at the time of the attack on Liam, and the teen described his behaviour between 2012 and 2013 as 'out of control'.

'I did have an anger problem ... I did have a drinking problem.'

When he was first taken into custody over the offence, DS conceded he only thought about himself.

'Now I know it is nothing in comparison to what people that night had to go through, especially Liam Knight.'

DS then told Mr Staples: It's not your fault what happened to Liam Knight, it's my fault.'

Outside court Liam said he believed DS was remorseful and accepted his apology, but was still angry with him.

'I just hope him and a lot of other people, they use me as an example that the violence today is just ridiculous, and people should think about what they do before they do it,' he told reporters.

Acting Judge Ronald Solomon said it was likely that DS would face a 'substantial sentence' when the matter returns to court in August.

The teen pleaded guilty to several assaults and was found guilty following a trial earlier this year of one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Liam.

Jimmy Angelo Tupou,19, was cleared of any involvement and found not guilty of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company earlier this year.

The hearing continues with DS expected to be sentenced in August.
