Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is happy on Merseyside but both the club and the player need to adapt to the needs of the other, according to the Italian's agent Mino Raiola.  

Balotelli was left out of the Reds squad on Saturday as Liverpool drew 0-0 with Bolton at home in the FA Cup fourth round.

However, Raiola believes the 24-year-old will return to the Liverpool team 'stronger than ever'.

Speaking to Sky Sports News HQ, Balotelli's agent said: 'Yes, he is happy at Liverpool. Nobody is happy to be left out but he reacted in a professional way.'

Balotelli - who was signed following Luis Suarez's departure to Barcelona after the Uruguayan scored 31 Premier League goals last term - has failed to find the net in the top-flight since his £16million summer arrival from AC Milan.

However, Raiola insists Liverpool need to be aware that Balotelli is a different player to Suarez and that both parties need to adapt to the needs of the other.

'They are different players. Liverpool knew that and people need to know he is not Suarez. Mario needs to adapt and Liverpool need to adapt,' he added.

Despite Balotelli's struggles this season, Raiola says the frontman will not be leaving Anfield this month.

'We didn't ask to leave,' he said. 'It is too early, with the injury, to say we leave in January. There are no big problems. He's adapting to a new style that the manager wants. We'll see in the summer.'
