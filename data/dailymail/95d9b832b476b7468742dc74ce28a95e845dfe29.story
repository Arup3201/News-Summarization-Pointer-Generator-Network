At the age of 11 Michael McConville 
watched a gang of masked IRA terrorists smash down the door of his 
family's West Belfast home and demanded to see his mother Jean.

They dragged her through the door as her children clung on to her legs and tried to fight the gunmen off. It was the last time they saw their mother alive.

A
 week later, a man who identified himself as being from the IRA called 
at the McConvilles' council home. He handed the children their mother's 
purse and wedding ring, saying: 'I was told to deliver this.'

Unbeknown
 to her ten children, Jean McConville had been taken to a beach with her
 hands tied behind her back and shot through the back of her head.

Since then Michael and his other siblings have lived in the hope that one day the murders would be brought to justice.

Then
 in 2003 her remains were accidentally discovered at a beach in County 
Louth in 2003. Tests showed she had been shot in the back of the head.

The discovery proved to be a key turning point in her children's quest for the truth.

Jean
 McConville was abducted from her council flat off the Catholic Falls 
Road in 1972 when neighbours informed IRA leaders she was a British 
sympathiser after she was seen comforting a soldier shot and wounded 
outside her home.

Soon after her act of kindness to the soldier, Mrs McConville was beaten and found wandering the streets dazed and bleeding.

Her children, then aged from six to 16, helped clean up her wounds at home. But they did not have time to heal.

Less
 than 24 hours later, more than a dozen figures, some wearing 
bala-clavas, arrived at the McConville family home and burst through the
 door demanding to see 'mammy'.

She
 became one of the so-called 'Disappeared', of whom there were at least 
16 IRA murder victims who had been buried at secret locations.

A 
decision was taken by the IRA in 1972 to stop dumping the mutilated 
bodies of alleged traitors on the streets of Belfast as a grim warning 
to others.

With
 a new breed of younger, 'modernising' figures emerging within the IRA, 
epitomised by the bespectacled Adams, it was decided that execut-ed 
'traitors' would be quietly disposed of in bogs and beaches along 
Ire-land's coastline.

Amid
 IRA fears that the family might go to the police, the then 11-year-old 
Michael was abducted by terrorist thugs himself. He was beaten and had a
 gun held to his head until he agreed he had not seen his mother being 
abducted.

The children fended for themselves until Michael and a younger brother were caught stealing food.They confessed all to police — and the children were promptly split up and put in different care homes.

In
 an interview with the Mail recently, Michael, now 52, said the 
inter-vening years had destroyed the lives of his siblings, who had been
 tor-tured by memories and had sought escape in drink or drugs.

'Time
 doesn't heal,' he said. 'The pain doesn't go away. It has destroyed us.
 There is not a day that goes by when I don't ask myself why I didn't do
 more. I know I was just a wee boy, but I still ask myself if I could 
have saved her.

'They
 took my mother from her house. To bring her down to a beach with her 
hands tied behind her back and to put a gun to the back of her head and 
shoot her — that was a war crime and the people responsible should be 
brought to The Hague [before the war crimes court].

He
 added: 'At the time all we had was each other. But I saw my brothers 
and sisters only about four or five times in the next six years. It was a
 nightmare. We became strangers to each other. Everybody has had their 
problems in different ways.'

When
 the IRA eventually confessed to abducting and killing her, they claimed
 it was because she was a 'tout' who was passing information to the 
British Army.

The
 McConville family has always insisted that their mother's only 
in-volvement with the Army was that she once gave succour to an injured 
squaddie.

Last
 year Jean's children received a huge breakthrough when 11 clandes-tine 
tapes recorded by Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries, which had  
languished for ten years in the archives of the Burns Library in Bos-ton
 College in the US, were handed over to the Police Service of North-ern 
Ireland.

They
 include an admission from Dolores Price, one of the IRA's most 
in-famous terrorists, that she ferried Michael's 37-year-old mother to 
the Irish Republic where she was tortured, tied up and shot in the head.

And she asserted it was Gerry Adams who sanctioned the murder.

Price
 refused to enlarge on why Adams ordered Mrs McConville's execu-tion, 
but commented: 'You don't deserve to die if you are an unpleasant 
person, as she was, but you do deserve to die if you are an informer. 
Par-ticularly in a war. That is the Republican way.'

For the McConville children, their mother's death blighted their lives for ever.

But perhaps now justice is at last in sight for them.
