Terrifying video has emerged of a man opening fire on a Michigan bus as innocent passengers run for cover, including a man holding a baby.

A peaceful Grand Rapids bus became a scene of panic on New Yearâ€™s Eve when a passenger shot what is believed to be .22-caliber pistol at a man sitting on the back seat.

The unidentified man fired about 8.30pm while the bus was stopped at South Division Avenue and Delaware Street SE.

Frightening: Surveillance footage shows the moment an unidentified gunman shot at a passenger on a Michigan bus on New Year's Eve

Lucky to be alive: The passenger who was shot at escaped injury, but keeled over and checked his body for bullet holes

Surveillance footage obtained by Grand Rapids Press/MLive captures the incident from three different angles.

It shows about 10 passengers - including a man holding a child - frantically rush to the front of the bus after the shot rang out.

The victim was not injured, but can be seen keeling over as the gunman fled through the middle doors.

The victim then walks past the bus driver, who asks if he's been shot. He exits and replies that he doesn't know.

The victim gets back on the bus and apparently checks himself for gunshot wounds before walking off the bus again.

It is not clear from the video what prompted the attack.

MLive reports shell casings were discovered on the bus and police are investigating. None of the passengers were injured.
