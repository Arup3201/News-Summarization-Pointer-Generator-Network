New York City is known for its constant reinvention and renewal, but for photographers James and Karla Murray, some of those changes hurt.

As iconic dive bars give way to fast food outlets, and kosher dairy joints are uprooted for bank chains, the East Village-based couple want to make sure we don't forget the city's colorful past.

The snappers photographed mom-and-pop stores everywhere from Harlem to the Lower East Side, to document the Big Apple's transformation for their 2008 book 'Store Front: The Disappearing Face of New York'.

Now, they've returned to those spots to capture the corporate takeover of New York, and have posted the pictures on their Facebook page, James and Karla Murray Photography.

'We hope this glimpse will bring awareness to the unique character these small mom-and-pop businesses add to the streets and neighborhoods of New York City and the sense of community they provide,' the Murrays, who have lived in New York for more than 20 years, told HuffPost.

'These storefronts have the city's history etched into their facades. We also hope that viewers will frequent small businesses so that they will continue to survive for many more years.'

Some of the most iconic small businesses the Murrays photographed included McHale's in Midtown, Max Fish in the Lower East Side and the original 2nd Ave Deli, a kosher delicatessen, in the East Village.

The pair snapped Mars Bar, an 'East Village institution' which closed in 2011 before TD Bank moved in, and decades-old hosiery wholesaler, Lismore Hosiery Co, which made way for Subway in the Lower East Side.

However, long-standing bar Lenox Lounge in Harlem has not yet been taken over by a bank or a McDonald's chain.

The historic club, founded in 1939 and frequented by a dazzling array of jazz greats including Billie Holiday, Miles Davis and John Coltrane, closed in 2012.

Owner Alvin Reed told New York Daily News Lenox Lounge will re-open late this summer, two blocks north of its old home, with its original facade and character.

The couple have also released another book, 'New 
York Nights', described by the New York Times as 'a neon-soaked celebration of the nocturnal institutions
 that keep the city that never sleeps awake, satiated and comfortably 
numb'.

The Murrays photographed iconic speakeasys, brasseries and dive bars in the early morning hours, perhaps the best time to capture the romance or poetry of a city.

'When you think of 
New York at night, you think of the skyline, of big, sweeping beauty 
shots,' James Murray said. 'We wanted to take people to the street 
corner sparkling at night.'
