High-street shoppers watched in disbelief as a 'frail pensioner' leapt over benches, did backflips and even performed a handstand on a moving escalator.

The wrinkled man, who said he was 90-year-old Jim Cook, stunned passers-by as he leapt between pillars and bounced off walls in the sleepy Hampshire town of Basingstoke.

Little did they know that they were in fact watching 27-year-old professional freerunner, Chase Armitage, performing stunts for a video he was making.

He's HOW old? Shoppers in Basingstoke gawp at the professional freerunner disguised as a frail OAP

Mr Armitage spent three hours with a professional make-up artist who used £5,000 of prosthetics to transform him into a wrinkled elderly gentleman who looked as if he'd find getting up from his armchair challenging enough.

A cardigan, specs and balding head with wispy hair were enough to make the athletic young man completely convincing.

Daredevil Chase, who is a professional free-runner, then took to the streets of his home town of Basingstoke, Hants, dressed as his character Mr Cook.

Mr Armitage is a member of the well-known freerunning group 3RUN, who filmed the stunt to make a video to encourage people to exercise.

He said: 'The prank worked best when
we performed it just once or twice and quickly moved on, leaving
people looking puzzled.

'The
guys I was with told those who asked that I'd invented free-running 
and was still obsessed with staying healthy and in good shape. 

Mr Armitage put some work into fooling his audience, puffing and panting and pretending his back hurt

Not what the shoppers of Basingstoke were expecting: Mr Armitage ran up a wall and did a backflip

'At the bottom of the escalator I really built up the tension, making it look like I would struggle to even walk up it.

'I think it’s fair to say people were more than a little surprised when I then climbed it on my hands.'

Freerunning, also known as parkour, involves performing gymnastic stunts on street furniture and buildings, and has its origins in late 1980s France.

Mr Armitage, who has been freerunning for 13 years, also visited a local gym, where he impressed personal trainers with his dead-lifts, flips, and pull-ups.

He said: '"Jim" added to the illusion by limbering-up before each jump and dramatically holding his lower back as if it was stiff whenever he landed.

Leaping over benches at the shopping centre, Mr Armitage drew some gasps from the afternoon crowds

Quite sprightly! Chase Armitage has been a freerunner for 13 years and says anyone can do it

After his make-up session Mr Armitage made a fairly convincing arthritic old man - until he did a backflip

'The reaction we got from the public was incredible: people of all ages were clearly fooled and dumbfounded.

'Some just stared for several seconds questioning if they could believe their eyes.'

Video director Scott Young, 24, said: 'A few elderly people bought it, and it was funny how the younger generation really fell for it as well.

'We filmed their reaction and they were wondering who the old guy was jumping off benches.

'It was brilliant.'
