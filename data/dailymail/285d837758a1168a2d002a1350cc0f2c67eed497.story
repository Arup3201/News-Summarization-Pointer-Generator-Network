The GOCE satellite, also known as the ‘Ferrari of space’, is expected to make a fiery fall to Earth sometime between the end of this month and the start of November.

With a sleek, aerodynamic design responsible for it being dubbed the ‘Ferrari of space’, GOCE has mapped variations in Earth’s gravity with extreme detail.

After more than four years on its mission, the one-tonne GOCE satellite will fall rapidly through the atmosphere, burning up as it descends.

Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer

Launched: 17 March 2009

Number of instruments: 3

Nominal life: 20 months

Mission cost: €350 million (£295 million)

Orbit: about 260 km altitude, polar, Sun-synchronous

Mass: 1100 kg

Size: 5.3 m long, about 1m body diameter

This is the first uncontrolled re-entry of a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite since 1987.

At a height of 224km, GOCE's orbit is so low that it experiences drag from the outer edges of 
Earth's atmosphere.

The satellite's streamline structure and use of 
electric propulsion system counteract atmospheric drag to ensure that 
the data are of true gravity.

While most of GOCE will disintegrate in the atmosphere, ESA expects that around 25 per cent might reach Earth’s surface.

When and where these parts might land cannot yet be predicted, but the affected area will be narrowed down closer to the time of re-entry. 

Taking into account that two thirds of Earth is covered by oceans and vast areas are thinly populated, the danger to life or property is very low.

About 40 tonnes of manmade space debris reach the ground per year, but the spread and size mean the risk of an individual being struck is lower than being hit by a meteorite.

The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) has been orbiting Earth since March 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite.

During its mission, it has produced a unique model of the ‘geoid’, which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another.

The colours in the image represent deviations in height from an ideal geoid. The blue shades represent low values and the reds/yellows represent high values

Around mid-October, the mission will come to a natural end when it runs out of fuel and the satellite begins its descent towards Earth from a height of about 224km.

Re-entry is expected to happen about three weeks after the fuel is depleted.  

An international campaign is monitoring the descent, involving the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee.

The situation is being continuously watched by the European Space Agency’s Space Debris Office, which will issue re-entry predictions and risk assessments.
