A newly-released investigative report has found that George Zimmerman passed two lie detector tests given to him on the night Trayvon Martin was shot dead, backing up his version of the events.

An hour-long interrogation video released this week captured Zimmerman as he described the events leading up to the moment when Trayvon Martin was shot with a single bullet to the chest.

As he spoke, his voice levels were being measured with a Computer Voice Stress Analyzer (CVSA), and was found to be telling the truth.

Interrogation: Zimmerman is questioned by a police detective on the day after the Trayvon Martin shooting

Probe: Zimmerman gestures in an interrogation video released this week along with new evidence that indicates he passes two lie detector tests after the shooting

However, the results of such tests are usually not admissible in court.

Sanford detective Chris Serino said 
Zimmerman verbally confronted the unarmed 17-year-old before the 
physical brawl that ended when Zimmerman shot and killed Martin.

Zimmerman claimed he was acting in self-defence when he shot the teen, who was returning to his father's girlfriend's house from a 7-Eleven store with an iced tea for himself and Skittles for his little brother on the night of the NBA All-Star Game.

A second report that was also released today said Zimmerman would have been able to defuse the confrontation if he would have identified himself as a neighborhood 
watch captain.

The two got into a fistfight and the 28-year-old Zimmerman maintains that Martin attacked him and was beating him up before he fatally shot him.

Questions: Zimmerman, pictured in court in April, will next appear at a bond hearing set for June 29

He has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder.

Serino wrote in his report that 
Zimmerman and witnesses said the defendant who was in his car avoided 
Martin when he first saw him because, as he told investigators, 'was 
afraid of Martin.' 

Serino also said that later in the encounter, Zimmerman got out of his SUV and followed Martin.

'His actions are inconsistent of those of a person who has stated he was in fear of another subject,' Serino wrote.

Based on his investigation, Serino recommended a charge of manslaughter to the state attorney.

Today, it emerged that Serino, the lead detective in the case, has been reassigned to the patrol division at his request.

A Sanford Police Department statement said Serino made the reassignment decision 'of his own volition.' He will begin his new assignment in July. He did not have a listed number.

An interrogation video also released 
this week shows Zimmerman being questioned about the shooting by 
detectives from the Sanford Police Department.

In video released last week by his attorney, Zimmerman told investigators his side of the story about the shooting.

He told them he grabbed his gun from a
holster on his waist before Martin could get it, and shot the teenager 
once in the chest.

After firing, Zimmerman said thought he missed because Martin didn't immediately fall over.

Zimmerman said Martin had been on top of him, slamming his head against the ground and smothering his mouth and nose with his hand and arm.

The tape shows two butterfly bandages on the back of Zimmerman's head and another on his nose. There are red marks on the front of his head.

'It felt like my head was going to explode,' he says in the video.

Zimmerman claims he shot the teen in self-defense, under Florida's 'stand your ground' law.

Martin's parents have said Zimmerman was the aggressor. They said Martin was walking back from a convenience store through the gated community in Sanford when Zimmerman spotted the black teenager and started following him. They claim their son was racially profiled.

Zimmerman's father is white and his mother Hispanic.

The latest release of documents in the case have come on the heels of unflattering telephone calls capturing Zimmerman and his wife talking in code about using money collected for a defense fund to pay credit cards.

Fears: The documents come about a week after the release of Tracy Martin's heartbreaking call to police to report his son missing. Trayvon, who had gone out to buy sweets, and his father are pictured

During her husband's initial bond hearing, Shellie Zimmerman testified that they had limited funds since she was a fulltime student and Zimmerman wasn't working. Prosecutors say they had raised about $135,000 from a website set up for his legal defense at the time of the April hearing.

She was charged June 13 with making a false statement. That came just days after a judge revoked George Zimmerman's bond for misleading the court about his finances.

He remains in jail awaiting a second bond hearing scheduled for Friday.
