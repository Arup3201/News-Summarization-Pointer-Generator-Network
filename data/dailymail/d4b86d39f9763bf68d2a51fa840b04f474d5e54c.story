Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to issue a humiliating apology after The Mail on Sunday exposed him for misleading the House of Commons over who will foot the huge compensation bill for victims of Jimmy Savile.

In a statement to the House last week, Mr Hunt pledged that Savile’s charities are responsible for paying up to £40 million due. But this newspaper can reveal that the charities are exempt – and that it is the NHS which is liable.

The Mail on Sunday has also learnt that a further bill, which may eventually be as large, will be met by BBC licence fee payers.

Pledge: Jeremy Hunt speaking in the House of Commons last week where he pledged that Jimmy Savile's charities would fit the £40 million bill due to his victims

Last night, in a major climbdown, a Department of Health spokeswoman confirmed that a statement to the House by Mr Hunt on February 26 was inaccurate. ‘He will be writing to the Opposition to correct it,’ she said.

She said the NHS had not set aside a ‘specific pot’ of money, but added: ‘We are committed to picking up any claims the estate cannot cover.’

The Savile estate is already effectively bankrupt.

Mr Hunt addressed the Commons after the publication of reports which detailed Savile’s abuse of victims at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and elsewhere.

He told MPs that a total of £40 million was still ‘under management’ in two charities Savile established and ‘that money will be made available to meet claims made by Savile’s victims’.

Mr Hunt added: ‘If it is not enough, the Government will meet any further claims through the NHS Litigation Authority.’

Savile founded the charities, mainly to fund healthcare, they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate, which is already effectively bankrupt

However, although Savile founded the charities, mainly to fund healthcare, they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate.

Last year the High Court and the Court of Appeal made clear that they cannot be asked to meet any compensation costs or damages.

And yesterday it emerged that neither charity held anything close to £40 million anyway. The Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust had around £1.75 million when it was wound up in 2013, and the accounts to December 2014 show the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust held £3.4 million.

Jo Summers, the charities’ solicitor, said: ‘There is no way funds in a charity can be used to pay compensation to victims, as this is not permitted by charity law. The only funds that can be used to pay compensation are the estate funds.’

The BBC has also agreed to pay the legal costs and damages for those abused on its premises.

Yesterday a spokesman refused to reveal how much the Corporation had earmarked, saying only: ‘The terms of the scheme were agreed with lawyers for the victims, as well as the NHS and the Savile estate.’

As of November last year, the Savile estate was worth £3.2 million. But almost all of this is certain to be eaten up in fixed payments to lawyers agreed under a ‘fast track’ compensation scheme for which about 200 people have applied. So far just 39 claims have been rejected.

As this newspaper reported last year, under the scheme each claim will trigger payments of up to £16,000 to lawyers.

Further payments will be made to law firm Osborne Clarke, which runs the scheme on behalf of Savile’s executors, NatWest.

The firm had already been paid £500,000 when the scheme was approved by the Court of Appeal in November, and will be due more.

In many cases, the damages paid will be less than the legal costs.

The Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust had around £1.75 million when it was wound up in 2013, and the accounts to December 2014 show the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust held £3.4 million

But this is not the end of taxpayers’ liability. As well as claiming under the fast track scheme, alleged victims can also sue Savile’s estate directly in the High Court. In last year’s court hearings it emerged that numerous actions are being considered – with damages and costs likely to be higher. However, bedevilling these is a lack of documentary records, and evidence of some false claims by individuals.

Ms Summers added: ‘It seems impossible to quantify the potential bill. The number of abuse allegations greatly outweighs the number of claims being brought under the scheme. It could be years before the NHS knows the total cost.’

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘It is of great concern that Jeremy Hunt could give such misleading information to victims and the Commons on a matter of this significance. He needs to return to the Commons at first opportunity to apologise to victims and correct the record.’
