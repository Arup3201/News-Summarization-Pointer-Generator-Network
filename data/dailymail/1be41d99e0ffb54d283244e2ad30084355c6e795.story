Violent clashes have broken out in Turkey after the funeral of a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a police tear-gas canister in anti-government protests.

Tens of thousands of people attended the procession in the capital Istanbul today for Berkin Elvan, who passed away yesterday nine months after slipping into a coma.

Tensions spilled over between riot police and protestors in several cities for a second day, with demonstrators calling on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to resign in the most serious clashes since Elvan was fatally injured last summer.

Anger: Violent clashes have spread across Turkey for a second day after the funeral of a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a police tear gas canister. Pictured: An injured woman is helped in the Turkish capital Istanbul

Protest: A policeman fires rubber bullets towards protesters after the funeral of the 15-year-old

Blast: Officers used water cannon to stop the thousands of protesters reaching the central Taksim Square

Soaked: The protests were dismissed as the work of anarchists by the Turkish prime minister Tayyip Erdogan, who is fighting allegations of corruption

Police fired water cannon, tear gas 
and rubber pellets on a major Istanbul avenue to stop tens of thousands 
of people chanting anti-government slogans from reaching the central 
Taksim Square.

There were similar scenes in the centre of the capital 
Ankara and in the Aegean coastal city of Izmir.

Crowds
 chanting 'Tayyip! Killer!' and 'Everywhere is Berkin, everywhere is 
resistance' held up photos of the 15-year-old as his coffin, draped in 
red and covered in flowers, was carried through the working class Okmeydani 
district.

Her voice hoarse with tears as her son's coffin was lowered into the ground, Elvan's mother Gulsum cried out: 'What am I to do now? They've taken my everything.'

Alevis are a religious minority in mainly Sunni Muslim Turkey who espouse a liberal version of Islam and have often been at odds with Erdogan's Islamist-rooted government.

The state-run Anadolu Agency said 102 people were arrested overnight in the Aegean port city of Izmir.

Today, thousands converged in front of a house of worship where Berkin's body lay and marched to the spot where he was struck in the head on June 16, before proceeding to the cemetery, his casket carried on mourners' shoulders.

Mourners chanted 'Berkin Elvan is immortal', 'Government resign!' and 'Murderer Tayyip.'

Some protesters hurled stones at a ruling party building, smashing its windows.

Police fired tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters in the capital Ankara and in Izmir.

The protesters' anger was directed at Erdogan because he sanctioned police's often heavy-handed crackdown on the wave of protests that swept Turkey in the summer and praised police as heroes.

Grief: The protesters directed their anger at at Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan because he sanctioned police's often heavy-handed crackdown on the riots

Innocent: Berkin was on his way to buy bread during anti-government street protests when he was struck in the head by a high-velocity gas canister

Berkin's death also comes at a time 
when Erdogan is fighting allegations of corruption and has taken a 
series of controversial steps - including removing police and 
prosecutors from key positions.

Critics say are aimed at stalling investigations into alleged corruption.

Turkey holds local elections on March 30, which Erdogan has acknowledged will act as a referendum on his rule.

Berkin
 was on his way to buy bread during anti-government street protests when
 he was struck in the head by a high-velocity gas canister.

Several police officers were questioned about Berkin's head injury but none has been charged.

His death raised the number of fatalities from last summer's protests to at least eight.

The
 summer's anti-government protests began as a small environmental sit-in
 against government plans to raise a central Istanbul park and turned 
into nationwide demonstrations against Erdogan's increasingly 
authoritarian style after police used force against those protesters.

Erdogan,
 campaigning around the country for March 30 local elections, failed to 
comment on Elvan's death at two campaign rallies today, railing instead 
against the protesters and saying they would be silenced at the ballot 
box.

'Trying to set fire to 
the streets 18 days before elections is not a democratic stance,' he 
told throngs of supporters at a rally in the southeastern city of 
Mardin.

He accused a 
coalition of 'anarchists, terrorists and vandals', the opposition and an
 influential U.S.-based Islamic cleric of stoking unrest.

'Scenarios are being prepared to shatter the peace,' he said. 'They are implementing new provocations to stir up the streets.'

Elvan,
 then aged 14, got caught up in street battles in Istanbul between 
police and protesters on June 16 last year while going to buy bread for 
his family.

He became a 
rallying point for government opponents, who held vigils at the Istanbul
 hospital where he lay in intensive care from a head trauma believed to 
have been caused by a police tear gas canister.
