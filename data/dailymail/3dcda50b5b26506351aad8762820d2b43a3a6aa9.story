These amazing pictures show the life-or-death struggle faced by Kurdish fighters as they battle through rubble-strewn streets against ISIS extremists in the battle for Syrian border town of Kobane.

Images from the front-line show the trail of destruction left in the town, where weeks of fighting have taken place as Islamic State militants make their advances.

US-led air strikes have hit jihadist positions in the north and east of Syria today, including an oil field, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Us-led airstrikes were launched on jihadist positions in the north and east of Syria today after militant shelling killed two civilians

The raids against ISIS came after militants shelled a camp for those displaced from Kobane - known as Ain al-Arab in Arabic - and killed two people, said the monitoring group.

A spokesperson for the Observatory said: 'Four explosions were heard during the night in Deir Ezzor province [in eastern Syria], caused by US-Arab air strikes in the area of the Tanak oil field and an IS checkpoint... killing two people.'

The Britain-based monitoring group, which relies on a network of sources on the ground for its reports, said it was unclear whether the casualties were jihadists or civilians. 

It has reported that four other people were injured, including a child, at the camp for people forced from Kobane by violence.

Kobane, which lies on the border with Turkey, has been besieged by IS for nearly two months as fighters stand guard for battle

In September ISIS launched a full scale assault on Kobane from the west and south of the town, destroying homes and buildings

The US-led coalition, which launched strikes against jihadist positions in Syria in September, also hit IS militants - which controls most oil fields in Deir Ezzor province - in Kobane.

The town on the border with Turkey has been besieged by IS for nearly two months and these latest photographs show Syrian Kurdish fighters armed and ready for battle as their town lies in ruins.

Men are seeing carrying guns in the streets, while other armed fighters hide in one of the many destroyed buildings. 

The Kurdish forces, backed by rebels and Iraqi peshmerga fighters, have been battling to expel IS from the town, where most of the 55,000 residents have fled.

The town has been left virtually empty as almost 90 per cent of its population has fled to seek refuge - mostly in neighbouring Turkey

Separately, the Syrian Observatory said fighting on Thursday night near Lebanon killed 31 combatants loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and 14 rebels, including Al-Qaeda militants.

There has been frequent violence in Syria's Mount Hermon, but the toll over recent days has been unprecedented. 

In recent weeks, Lebanon has all but closed the border officially to incoming Syrian refugees, with troops bolstering border security.

More than 1.1 million Syrian refugees are living in Lebanon, straining the country's limited resources and infrastructure.

Last week ISIS released images of their fighters engaging in street fighting in Kobane as part of their latest publicity stunt.

The pictures, distributed by the media office in the ISIS 'capital' of Raqqa in Syria, show jihadis firing rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles in the ruined streets of the town.

Meanwhile, an international rights group claimed Islamic State militants tortured and abused Kurdish children captured earlier this year near the town.

Human Rights Watch based its conclusions on interviews with several children who were among more than 150 Kurdish boys from Kobane abducted in late May as they were returning home after taking school exams in the city of Aleppo.

It said around 50 of the Kurds escaped early in their captivity, while the rest were released in batches - the last on October 29.
