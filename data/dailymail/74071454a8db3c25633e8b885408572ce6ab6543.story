Looking to boost contact with the other side? Eat  watercress, steamed fish, vegetables and avocado. 

But if you would rather not hear voices from beyond the grave, stick to roast dinners, smoked fish and red meat.

The psychic claims good foods for helping expand the mind to another realm include watercress, steamed fish, vegetables and avocado.

She said: 'Food - not only necessary to keep us alive - can lift one's intelligence and enhance the memory and promote learning power.'

According to Psychic Cara, roast dinners, smoked fish, red meat, pastry, cakes, and too much saturated fat and sugar are not just bad for the waistline.

'I imagine a huge Yorkshire pudding, slices of succulent beef, various veg and luscious steaming gravy, and a nice red wine are fantastic this time of year.

'But the problem is, although the connection to the other dimension may not be initially impaired, if you tried to do any meditation afterwards it's likely it would be.'

Roast dinners, smoked fish, red meats, cakes and pastries are on the forbidden foods list

Her advice is to drink fresh fruit and vegetable blends to enhance lines of communication with the spirit world. 

'A nice light meal before meditation would be to blend  equal amounts of carrot, apple and celery,' she continued. 

'It's full of nutrients and easy to digest and it tastes really nice too. Or steamed or baked white fish such as cod, pollock, hake with some broccoli and watercress and maybe a couple of cashew or Brazil nuts.'

According to Cara, a psychic's diet is very important.

Is anybody there? Cara says certain foods will help people hone psychic powers

'The brains ability to make high levels of specific neurotransmitters, depends on the amount of certain nutrients circulating in the blood - hence the brain is affected by what we eat.

'One of the most important neurotransmitters for memory and learning is acetylcholine. The brain makes it from the B vitamin known as choline which is found in lecithin.

'Choline has been proven to boost memory within 90 minutes and improve the mood. Use if before an important meeting or exam.

'A psychic needs a lot of energy to communicate with 'Spirit' - hence diet is very important.'

The mystic is now writing a book about her findings entitled 'Knowing (Before, Now and Then)' which details how to open minds the psychic world.
