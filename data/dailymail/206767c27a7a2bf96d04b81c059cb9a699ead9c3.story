Every epic journey starts with a single, small step. Not necessarily from the canteen of a car plant outside Luton, but hey ho. Roy Hodgson, the England manager, is used to playing the hand he has been dealt and on Monday that meant fronting up his World Cup squad, not at Wembley or St George’s Park, or even on stage at the Cafe Royal as in previous years, but at a Vauxhall factory off junction 10 of the M1.

The modern Football Association are really spoiled for choice when it comes to suitable venues. They have dramatic locations, magnificent backdrops that would speak of this fine game and its history.

Instead they just go with the dough.

Decision time: Roy Hodgson has named a young England squad for the World Cup in Brazil this summer

Helping hand: Roy Hodgson arrives at Luton for the England team announcement

So Luton it is. Maybe, occasionally, in a quiet corner, a man in a blazer wonders why nobody takes his employers seriously as football’s  governors and reformers anymore, but then the marketing department bounce en route to another sponsored cocktail hour and the moment soon passes.

Greg Dyke, the FA chairman, announced his commission of all the talents at a lunch sponsored by Vauxhall, too. And in World Cup year, it is time again to sell England by the pound.

There is a Premier Inn opposite the Vauxhall head office and the council were dredging the nearby canal of shopping trolleys when Hodgson arrived at lunchtime in a Corsa hatchback.

‘Refined, comfortable and pretty good to drive,’ What Car? says of the Corsa. Against that, it argues that resale values are poor, the smaller engines are short of motorway pace and bulky windscreen pillars obscure the view.

So a mixed bag really. Much like the England team. Used to be famous for rust, but consumers complained and they sorted it out.

Now there is youth, pace and promise in Hodgson’s squad, but dark memories, too.

Young guns: Raheem Sterling (left) and Adam Lallana both made Roy Hodgson's 23-man England squad

Rewarded: Ross Barkley enjoyed a fine season with Everton and is off to the World Cup with England

England had a golden generation before, remember, and it turned out to be overvalued. It is the determination to reject this tainted era that has led to such clamour for Hodgson to go with youth.

And so it begins again. Raheem Sterling, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and the rest are only getting the same publicity that once greeted Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, David Beckham and Paul Scholes.

If they lose, experience suggests it will end the same way. Except nobody can then argue that  Hodgson needs to bring on the kids to solve this crisis. He did that, on Monday.

There are only six players in the 23 who have gone to a World Cup finals tournament yet Hodgson is far from gambling.

The debate over Shaw versus Ashley Cole aside, there is not a young player in this group who has not been included on merit. These are not kids, but the best England have got. They just happen to be young.

Hodgson lists pragmatism as one of his personal qualities and he has not turned daredevil overnight. Come at the debate from another direction. Remove the kids. Take out Barkley, Sterling, Lallana, even Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Who would England pick? Michael  Carrick? Stewart Downing? Ashley Young? Gareth Barry? The young players are better, the best Hodgson has available.

This is no throw of the dice. This is English football, 2014.

Not so golden? David Beckham, Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Paul Scholes

The sole controversy is the exclusion of Cole at left back. Many would have him not just in the squad but in the starting XI against Italy on June 14, when a belt and braces approach may be required.

Yet it is hard to argue against Hodgson’s decision to go with Shaw. He described the young players as imposing themselves on this squad and a teenager from Southampton seems a more obvious understudy to Leighton Baines than a 33-year-old with 107 caps.

Bizarrely, though, having made the hard call, Hodgson spent much of the afternoon presenting the case for Cole.

From a position where England had good left backs in such number that some were advocating picking three just to fit them all in, Hodgson is now in a position where if Baines limped off against Peru this month, England’s left back in Brazil would be Shaw, who has played one game, with Jon Flanagan of Liverpool as his understudy and still waiting for his England debut.

Believers in Sod’s Law will already be contemplating the inevitable twang of an Evertonian hamstring.

‘Yes, I’ve heard the view that Cole would be the answer if Baines got injured,’ said Hodgson. ‘And he would be, without a doubt. An injury against Peru would make the choice of Shaw a very bad selection. But Ashley Cole isn’t really a cover player.

End of an era: Ashley Cole retired from international football after being left out of the England squad

Big chance: Luke Shaw will be England's back-up left back behind Leighton Baines this summer

‘Everyone knows what Ashley is and what Ashley can do. He is a No 1 man. When I decided Baines was No 1, I decided the next player would have to be Luke Shaw.

‘Circumstances could make the decision very good or very bad. If Leighton doesn’t get injured early on, if we go through the World Cup with him playing the majority of games and Shaw coming on and doing well, it makes it a good selection.’

World Cup rules mean that an injury to Baines before June 2 would mean a battlefield promotion for Flanagan. After that, Cole could be considered from outside the standby squad, the problem being his decision to announce international retirement after Hodgson’s rejection.

Are the lines of communication still open, pending an emergency?

‘You would have to ask Ashley that,’ stalled Hodgson. ‘I would like to think so.

‘He’s a very experienced player and a very good one but do you think, when you have a player of his ability, you invite him along to a tournament on the basis that he might get the odd game? Is that the correct thing to do?’

‘We have another very talented player in Shaw, the subject of a £27million bid from one of the best teams in the world, who has had a fantastic season and will have a fantastic future.

Rolling back the years: Hodgson's England squad is considerably younger than Fabio Capello's in 2010

‘You can’t cover both eventualities. If you’re going to take a player like Shaw, without experience, you really need three left backs: two seniors because of injury and the other one. You can’t do that.

‘Twenty-three players did not give me that luxury. I can’t take them all. We might have been better off with Ashley, I can’t deny that. I’m certain Luke wouldn’t deny that if circumstances occur.

‘Then again, we might go through the tournament and get congratulated because we gave a young player a big chance.’

This is a second honeymoon for Hodgson and he is enjoying the changing public perception of him as a cavalier, a believer in youth.

Fabio Capello’s World Cup squad in 2010 was the oldest to depart these shores, Hodgson’s, at 26, the youngest since 1958. That group, average age 24.8, contained only four players with caps in double figures and five that had never played a game for England.

It was the beginning of a golden age that would see England win the World Cup eight years later. And how many of the class of 1958 were in Sir Alf Ramsey’s glorious band in 1966? One. Bobby Charlton.

You see, sometimes it isn’t about kids, experience, planning or continuity. Sometimes you just pick the best 23 players and that works as well.
