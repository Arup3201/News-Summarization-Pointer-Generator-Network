After carrying the Dallas Cowboys into the playoffs, DeMarco Murray will stay in the NFC East.

But he will be suiting up in Philadelphia as a vital cog in Chip Kelly's offense.

The NFL's Offensive Player of the Year is set to sign a five-year deal worth more than $40million, with more than $20m guaranteed, according to NFL.com's Albert Breer.

Murray became the NFL's leading rusher thanks to a career-high number of carries (392) and working behind one of the best offensive lines in football.

DeMarco Murray is set to join the Philadelphia Eagles after four seasons with the Cowboys

In a career-high year, Murray carried the Cowboys into the playoffs for the first time in five years

With rumours that veteran Evan Mathis is to be traded, the Eagles do have the youth or consistency in that position group.

The 27-year-old had a career-high season with 1,845 yards and 13 touchdowns, but Dallas let him enter the free agent market.

And it was Murray who initiated the meeting with the Eagles head coach Chip Kelly, ESPN report.

DeMarco Murray (RB, from Dallas) 

Ryan Mathews (RB, from San Diego) 

Expressing a desire to play in Kelly's fast-paced, spread offense, he spoke of his friendship with Sam Bradford, with whom he played at college in Oklahoma for two years.

After joining from St Louis in the remarkable trade with Nick Foles, Bradford confirmed he played a part too.

'Absolutely. I've been trying my hardest,' Bradford said. 'I've called him. I've texted him. I've done everything. We've been in communication. If we can somehow land him, it would be a great pickup. Not only is he a great player, he's a great person. He's a really close friend of mine, too. I think he can really help this ball club.'

The Eagles, who have had an eventful free agency, also announced the signing of fellow running back Ryan Mathews.

The former San Diego Charger joins on a three-year, $11.5m contract, with a guaranteed $5m.

With Darren Sproles already in situ, it gives Kelly a loaded backfield and the ability to use multiple backs.
