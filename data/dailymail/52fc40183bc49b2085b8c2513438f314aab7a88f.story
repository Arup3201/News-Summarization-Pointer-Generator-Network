A Navy veteran has been fired and branded a terrorist for posting Facebook pictures of Homeland Security SUVs parked at a hotel where he works near Ferguson.

Mark Paffrath, who worked for the Drury hotel chain, took photos and a video of dozens of vehicles marked with the logos of the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Protection Services which arrived in the parking lot of Chesterfield’s Drury Plaza Hotel  last week.

The vehicles are parked about a 30-minute drive from Ferguson, Missouri.

Mark Paffrath, a hotel worker, was fired and called 'a terrorist' after taking photos (pictured) of Homeland Security vehicles in hotel parking lot near Ferguson 

Paffrath (seen left now and right during his time in the military) said he was offended by the comment that he was a terrorist as he served three years in the military, including overseas stints before he was honorably discharged

'You know, it surprised me, and I was rather shocked that they were there,' he said, reports CNN.

'So I took a short video and a picture of the vehicles. I didn't give any location out.' 

He posted the photos on Facebook on Thursday and wrote: 'Why are all these vehicles here, I wonder if it has anything to do with Ferguson? #Ferguson, #No justice, no peace.'

Paffrath says he was also told by his superiors that he put a $150, 000 contract with the Department of Homeland Security in jeopardy for the hotel

The next day his boss called him in and told him to take down the pictures, which he removed from his page and he continued to work for the rest of the day.

But on Saturday he was again called to the General Manager's office where he was fired from the job he had for approximately a year and a half.

'The head of security for Drury was in there, and he pretty much called me a terrorist, saying that I dishonorably served my country for posting those pictures and videos on Facebook,' Paffrath said.

Paffrath insists the staff should have been told previously of the confidential nature of the visit and a message board telling staff of their stay only went up a day after he posted the photo

Paffrath said he was offended by the comment as he  served three years in the military, including overseas stints,  before he was honorably discharged.

He told Argus News Now he pleaded for his job with Jim Bohner, Director of Security for Drury Hotels, saying he 'never put the location down on the post'.

But he claims Bohner told him: 'All they have to do is click on your name and see where you work'.

Paffrath says he was also told by his superiors that he put the hotel's $150,000 contract with the Department of Homeland Security in jeopardy.

He claimed Bohnert ended the conversation with 'if you repost the photos and video you will have the federal government knocking on your door and you will be incarcerated'. 

Paffrath says the staff should have been told previously of the confidential nature of the visit and insists a message board telling staff of their stay only went up a day after he posted the photo.

The hotel where Paffrath worked said it was not authorized to comment on the case, but Joseph Pereles, a Drury Hotels' vice president, sent this statement to CNN: 'We do not publicly discuss confidential personnel matters. 

'The safety and privacy of our guests and our team members has always been and will remain our top priority.'

The Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service confirmed that the vehicles belong to them, reports Fox News. 

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard in advance the grand jury decision about whether Darren Wilson (left) will be charged in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown (right)

In his executive order on Monday, Nixon (pictured) cited the 'possibility of expanded unrest' 

They refused comment on why so many are in town, and would not answer the specific question as to whether they are in place in anticipation of the St. Louis County Grand Jury’s decision in the case of Officer Darren Wilson. 

On Monday Missouri Governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency head of an expected grand jury decision and and activated the National Guard in the case of Michael Brown.

In his executive order, Nixon cited the 'possibility of expanded unrest.' 

He said that while protesters reserve the right to led peaceful demonstrations, he must endure that citizens and businesses must be protected from violence and damage.

Protesters are gathering in and around St. Louis as they nervously await what many believe will be an inevitable no-indictment vote in the coming days about whether police officer Darren Wilson will be charged in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay said the role of National Guard troops is designed to be secondary to local law enforcement and they will be used as 'back-up support' and will be stationed at shopping centers, government buildings.

The state of emergency will last 30 days unless extended by another order.
