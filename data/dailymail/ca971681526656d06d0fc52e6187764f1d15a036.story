Hospitals in England have failed to meet waiting time targets in A&E for five months running.

The latest set of figures, published today, reveal the misery for patients is ongoing, with no sign of the mounting pressure on medical staff abating.

NHS England said 91.6 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival in A&E to being admitted to hospital, transferred or discharged.

The figures reveal performance for the week ending February 15 and is down from 92.9 per cent the previous week - short of the 95 per cent target.

The damning statistics mark the 20th consecutive week that the A&E target has been missed. 

Hospital across England have failed to meet the A&E waiting time target for a 20th consecutive week, with just 91.6 per cent of patients spending four hours or less between arriving at A&E and being admitted, transferred or discharged - the target is 95 per cent. It comes as hospitals face massive demand

It came as the level of admissions reached its highest levels since the peak seen at Christmas.

Across England, 420,700 patients visited A&E departments, up from 407,000 the previous week.

Emergency admission were also up 107,200 from 105,500 the previous week, and up on the 104,500 weekly peak seen last year. 

More than 8,890 people had to wait more than four hours, up from 7,280 the previous week.

Dr Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, said: 'Last week saw a sharp increase in A&E attendances and emergency admissions - up by nearly 15,000 on the week before. 

'These are the highest levels since Christmas and are also up on the same week last year.

'This has resulted in a slight impact on waiting times, but we continue to admit, treat and discharge more than nine out of 10 patients within four hours.'

In the week leading up to Christmas, A&E departments saw an unprecedented peak of 446,473 attendances. 

In January figures released by NHS England revealed that from October to December last year A&E waiting times plummeted to the lowest levels recorded in a decade. 

In that time 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target.

The latest performance marks the worst quarterly results since the target was introduced at the end of 2004. 

The Government  admitted the figures were 'disappointing' - and conceded there is a 'huge amount of pressure' on the health service. 

Speaking at the time Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said hospital bosses feel they are 'running just to keep still' to cope with rising demand.

Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron said, at the time, much of the pressure on emergency departments comes as society faces an ageing population, with more frail, elderly people.

But he insisted that around 2,500 more patients were being seen within four hours every day than four years ago.
