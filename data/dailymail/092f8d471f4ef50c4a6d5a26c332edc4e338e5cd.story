You're 19 years old, at your first senior Wimbledon tournament. The score is 3-3 in the second set against the top seed, a true great of the game. Most would probably ensure they didn't do anything silly against Rafael Nadal on Centre Court.

But not Nick Kyrgios. This teenager produced the shot of the tournament at a moment of tension in the match.

Nadal's powerful backhand was struck straight at the Australian, who duly opened his legs, clipping an outrageous effort past the disbelieving Spaniard for a winner.

Kyrgios who has been tipped to become a star in the game, won the first set against the former champion, notching 20 aces in the first two sets alone.

Nadal may have come back to win the second, but it looked set to be a thriller on Centre Court.

And that it was, with Kyrgios winning the match to set up a clash with Milos Raonic in the quarter-finals.
