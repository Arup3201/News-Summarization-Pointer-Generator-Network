A two-year-old boy saved his mother’s life by managing to call 999 when she collapsed, telling operators:  'Mummy’s on the floor!'

Despite only just learning to talk, Riley Ward called 999 and managed to tell operators his mother Dana Henry had collapsed.

Paramedics rushed to their home in Barrow Upon Soar, Leicestershire, where they discovered Ms Henry who had to be rushed to hospital for emergency surgery for a blood clot.

Riley took the initiative to ring for help when his 27-year-old mother collapsed at home just before 11.30 am on February 5.

Ms Henry had woken up with stomach pains and fell to the floor after making a cup of tea.

At 11.31am, Riley rang 999 and said: 'Mummy’s asleep,' after which the call was passed to the ambulance service who managed to trace the address.

Riley repeatedly said ‘hello’ and kept operators on the line, trying to explain that his mum was on the floor.

Ms Henry later had emergency surgery at Leicester Royal Infirmary where doctors discovered a large blood clot and dangerous bleed on her ovary.

Riley is now being rewarded with an award for his brave actions by East Midlands Ambulance Service who believe he is their youngest ever caller.

Brave: Riley called 999 and said: 'Mummy's asleep,' after which the call was passed to the ambulance service who managed to trace the address

His mother said: 'I am so proud of Riley. He is mummy’s little hero. I have told so many of my friends and family about what he did.

'My friends who have young children are so amazed, and are making sure their children would know what to do.

'All I remember from when it happened is the room getting smaller and smaller and then I opened my eyes when I heard a police officer trying to kick my door down.'

'Riley was sat on his toy box looking out of the window at the flashing blue lights. I managed to get to the door, but collapsed again.”

'When the surgeon came to see me the next day, she said she had never seen anything like it.

'I would never have rung 999 - I would have kept taking pain killers and hoping it would go away.

'It really scared me, because if I hadn’t passed out and Riley hadn’t rung the ambulance I might not be here today.

Diligent: Ms Henry said she and her partner had always drilled it into Riley and his sister Caitlin (pictured) that they should ring 999 if ever they could not wake either of them

'It’s made me proud that Riley knew what to do. We knew he remembered 999, but were so shocked he was able to put it into action.'

Ms Henry said she and partner, Rob Ward, 30, had always drilled it into Riley and his sister, Caitlin, five, that they should ring 999 if ever they could not wake either of them.

The first paramedic on the scene, Paul Staples, said:  'When control radios through to tell you a child has dialled 999 you are immediately concerned for both the child and the patient.

'When I got to Dana’s house, Riley was stood at the door with a big smile. I think he was excited he had a police officer and paramedic in his house.

'He was really interested in all my equipment and kept coming to check on his mummy.

'His family must be so proud of him. He is a really brave little boy.'
