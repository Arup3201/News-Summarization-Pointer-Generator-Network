Sir Chris Hoy became Britain’s most golden Olympian in sensational style last night.

His track cycling victory took Team GB’s gold medal tally to 22 – the most since 1908.

The 36-year-old stormed to a thrilling win in the keirin event before a baying 6,000 crowd in the velodrome.

Another 15million watched on TV as he claimed his sixth Olympic gold – one more than rower Sir Steve Redgrave, who later joked that he might have to get back into training to reclaim his record.

Chants
of ‘Hoy, Hoy’ rang out as he punched the air and acknowledged 
supporters including Prince William and Harry, Princess Anne and Lord 
Coe.

Shedding tears as the national anthem was played, the Scot said: ‘I’m in shock. You try to compose yourself but it’s surreal.

'I
wanted to win gold in front of my home crowd. I saw everyone stepping 
up to the plate and thankfully it worked out for me, too.

‘I can’t describe the feelings I have at the moment. This is enough for me, this is the perfect end to my Olympic career.’

It
was the climax of another incredible day for the home team with four 
gold medals. The total haul of 22 eclipses the 19 won at Beijing four 
years ago.

Team GB now has 47 medals of all colours with more guaranteed in the men’s and women’s boxing.

In
a few hours of extraordinary drama yesterday, Alistair Brownlee, 24, 
delivered the first gold in the triathlon in a packed Hyde Park.

His brother Jonny, 22, collapsed from exhaustion after winning the bronze.

Thanking the home fans, Alistair, 
said: ‘I don’t think I’ve ever come across anything like that, my ears 
were stinging. It was amazing.’

Soon
it was the turn of Laura Bechtolsheimer, Carl Hester and Charlotte 
Dujardin, who held off a strong challenge from Germany to win the team 
dressage in the Greenwich Arena.

It was Britain’s first ever dressage gold and came 24 hours after the equestrian team’s victory in the show jumping team.

Attention
then switched to the Velodrome where Laura Trott, 20, confirmed her 
status as the new star of British cycling with a brilliant win in the 
six-discipline omnium.

It was her second gold of London 2012.

Edinburgh-born Hoy followed up her 
achievement with his second gold of the Games to add to his one from 
Athens in 2004 and three from Beijing.

‘I can’t put into words what it means to me. It’s one of the greatest feelings I have ever had,’ he said.

‘The
crowd have been absolutely magnificent throughout and the noise they 
made was deafening – it definitely makes a difference to have that kind 
of volume of home support and to know how much people are behind us as a
team.’

He did several
laps of honour to celebrate holding off the rest of the field in the 
keirin, which starts with a pace-making motorcycle.

Redgrave, who won his golds at five 
successive Olympics, was in the Velodrome to see his crown taken from 
him. He gave Hoy a hug and  said his win was ‘great’.

'I would have loved to have won in my final race. I’m glad that it’s all done and I can move on.’

Gold rush: Britain's athletes won their 48th medal at London 2012 on Tuesday night, beating the country's haul from the Beijing Olympics of 2008. Team GB's medal count stood at 22 golds, 13 silvers and 13 bronzes. In 2008, our athletes won 19 golds, 13 silvers and 15 bronzes

Some fans say it should be the British team’s anthem for London 2012, but for others it has become an irritation.

Spandau Ballet’s song Gold is played on the BBC’s Olympics Tonight show whenever our gold medal tally needs to be increased on the studio chart – that’s 22 times as of last night.

But some fans are sick of the track, which was a hit in 1983. One wrote online: ‘The unfortunate side effect of Team GB winning so many gold medals [is that] Spandau Ballet is stuck in my head. Thanks BBC.’

However, many are calling for Spandau Ballet to play at the closing ceremony, and band member Gary Kemp, told the Daily Mail: ‘We would love to take part. If they asked we would jump at it. I am so proud of the team.’

Australia's sports minister has lost a bet with her British counterpart over who would do better at London 2012.

Kate Lundy had bet Hugh Robertson that if Australia did not beat Britain in medals, she would row down the Olympic course on Eton Dorney wearing a Team GB shirt. 

His forfeit if Britain lost out was to play hockey in a Kookaburras’ shirt.

With Australia at 13th in the medals table and Britain in third, Miss Lundy admitted she would have to put on the shirt and test her rowing skills.

She told Channel 4 news: ‘I’ve already conceded I know I’m going to be rowing out of Eton.’

The cyclist said he was unlikely to 
compete at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro but could carry on until the
2014 Commonwealth Games, which are being held in Glasgow.

There
was disappointment for home fans when double gold medallist Victoria 
Pendleton, 31, was beaten by her greatest rival Australian Anna Meares 
in the individual sprint.

She did however become the most successful British female Olympian.

Pendleton, who had entered London 
2012 hoping to win three Olympic golds and had lost that chance after 
disqualification in her first race five days ago, appeared to have taken
the lead in her three-race final after crossing the line first, but the
win was taken away from her for a technical infringement.

‘I’m just so relieved and I’m overwhelmed with emotion,’ said Pendleton, who is retiring after the Games.

It
meant that Britain’s track cyclists had won seven of the ten events in 
the Velodrome together with a road cycling gold taken by Tour de France 
winner Bradley Wiggins.

A 
silver medal in the windsurfing at Weymouth for Nick Dempsey added to 
Britain’s tally and Robbie Grabarz won high jump bronze in the athletics
stadium.

That means Team GB has equalled the overall medals total from 2008 with five days of action left.

Chef de mission Andy Hunt said: ‘What has been achieved is the result of a shared commitment made by 541 athletes.'

Hoy became a member of the national squad in 1996 and won his first world championship medal in 1999 - a silver in the team sprint.

He has since won 11 world and two Commonwealth titles.

Hoy won his first Olympic gold medal in Athens in 2004 in the kilo event, but went on to focus on other disciplines after it was dropped from the schedule for the Beijing Games in 2008.

He rode in the keirin, the sprint and the team sprint at Beijing and won a gold medal in all three.

In doing so, he became the first Briton since 1908 to win three gold medals in a single Olympic Games, and the most successful Olympic male cyclist of all time.

He was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2008 and was awarded a knighthood in the 2009 New Year Honours list.

The velodrome for the 2014 Commonwealth Games has been named after the cyclist.
