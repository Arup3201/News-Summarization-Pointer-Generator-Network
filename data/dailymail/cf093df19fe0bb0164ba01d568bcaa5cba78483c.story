Former First Daughter Caroline Kennedy is to sit on a Manhattan jury that will help decide the fate of a cocaine dealer

The only surviving child of President John F. Kennedy and the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will serve on the Supreme Court panel hearing the case of Nelson Chatman.

When asked during jury selection if she or any member of her family had ever been a victim of a crime, Caroline Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg decided to skip and not answer.

I do solemnly swear: Caroline Kennedy will be sitting on a jury in Manhattan this week in the trial of a coke dealer

She would of course had to mention that her father, former President John F Kennedy and her uncle, former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, were both victims of assassinations.

'I have not been convicted of a crime,' Kennedy said during jury selection at the Centre St. courthouse.

She also didn't mention the stalking episodes her family had to endure a couple of years ago.

The next question on the survey asked whether any member of her family had been involved with law enforcement.

Kennedy curse: Caroline Kennedy mentioned that her brother John Junior was a former district attorney but did not mention his tragic death in a place crash off the Massachusetts coast in 1999

'My brother, years ago, worked as an assistant district attorney,' she said. Ms. Kennedy did not mention that her late brother, John F Kennedy Jr was killed in a private plane crash off Martha's Vineyard.

She was also uneasy when a defense lawyer asked her if she knew anyone with a drug problem.

'I know a few people,' she muttered. A number of Kennedy's have admitted their problems with drugs in the past including cousins Robert F. Junior and David who used heroin and Patrick J who took cocaine.

It's not clear whether Kennedy gave a fuller account of her law enforcement ties behind closed doors about her family history of drug use or connection to two of the biggest political crimes in the twentieth century.

Other jurors who were in the gallery to be chosen for jury service listened intently as the mother of three began to speak.

Daddy's little girl: President Kennedy, and Caroline seated in car in 1963. She did not mention her father's assassination during jury selection at Manhattan Supreme Court

Family history: President Kennedy, little John Jr. and Caroline in August 1963. Now, Caroline is a mother of 3, lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, has a law degree and is an author

'My name is Caroline Kennedy,' said the 55-year-old. 'I live on the upper East Side. I’ve lived at my present address for 25 years. I live with my husband and two grown children. I have a law degree and I’m an author,' Kennedy said.

She will sit on the trial of Nelson Chatman, 31, who is contesting charges of selling cocaine.

He was caught in December selling drugs on a street corner in Harlem to an undercover police officer.

Kennedy has written at least seven books including 'The Right to Privacy' and her latest 'Poems to Learn By Heart' came out this spring.

She said her writing career would not influence her ability to make a decision in the case.

Chatman’s trial starts today and will last for about a week.
