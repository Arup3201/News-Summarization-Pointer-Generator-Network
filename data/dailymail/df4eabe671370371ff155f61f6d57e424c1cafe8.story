The last time somebody mistook Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for another player, it saved him from being sent off, but against Scotland it robbed him of a goal.

ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley shouted Wayne Rooney's name as Oxlade-Chamberlain headed England in front against Scotland at Celtic Park.

Clearly embarrassed, Tyldesley then re-recorded his commentary for the highlights package in an attempt to remove any trace of his mistake. Unfortunately for him, the ploy was noticed by keen-eared fans who then posted both versions online.

ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley confused Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for England captain Wayne Rooney

The simple mistake had no bearing on the game as England ran out eventual 3-1 winners, with Wayne Rooney eventually getting on the score-sheet twice. 

The same cannot be said, though, of the last time the Arsenal midfielder was involved in a case of mistake identities. 

In March last season the former Southampton man blocked a shot with his hand during the Gunners' 6-0 hammering at Chelsea. 

But instead of sending off the real offender, Andre Marriner decided to produce a red card for defender Kieran Gibbs.

Unlike Tyldsley, the not-so-keen-eyed official didn't notice his mistake until too late.
