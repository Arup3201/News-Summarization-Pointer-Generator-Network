Tragedy: Ashley Dixon, 23, threw himself under his tractor after his girlfriend ended their three-month relationship, an inquest heard

A young father threw himself under his tractor after his girlfriend ended their three-month relationship, an inquest heard.

Ashley Dixon, 23, was at work on a farm in Salford, when he texted his former lover Fern Brooks to say: 'I have totally given up, there is no life for me any more.'

A short time later, he threw himself under the tractor. His body was found by his manager.

Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene.

A jury at Bolton Coroner’s Court heard Mr Dixon, from Salford, fell for Ms Brooks when they started seeing each other last May, shortly after he separated from the mother of his two-year-old daughter.

He threatened to throw himself off a bridge when she first broke up with him on June 11, but police helped him down. The couple rekindled their relationship and Mr Dixon sought counselling.

Weeks later he told his doctor he had ‘sorted his head out’. But on the morning of his death, August 7, he called his foster mother to say the relationship had ended.

Text records revealed a stormy exchange between the pair, with Mr Dixon twice threatening to take his own life. The last text was sent at 1.30pm - an hour before he was found dead.

Forensics expert PC Nicholas Avery ruled out that the death was an accident. Boss Mark Upton told the hearing that Mr Dixon was not himself after his break-up in June.

He said: 'We were very concerned about him. He texted me on June 12 to say he had threatened to throw himself off a bridge and I knew it was because of his relationship.

'He fell head-over-heels for her but it was rocky. He was very, very capable at his job, and the farm was his life, but after that day he started to slip. He was never on time. We were very worried.'

He said Mr Dixon arrived at work 
uncharacteristically early and appeared to be in good spirits on the 
morning of his death, a week before his 24th birthday.

Death: Mr Dixon was at work on a farm near Salford when he died. His body was found by his manager after he failed to answer his mobile phone

They discussed 
his work for the day, and at 7.30am he set off to flail the long grass 
in a field near Salford. Mr Dixon was last seen by shopworkers on the road at 10.30am. At 2.45pm, Mr Upton became worried that his worker, an expert driver, had not finished mowing the 30-acre field.

He said: 'I tried him on his mobile but it didn’t even ring, so I jumped in the van and drove out there. I could just see the tractor was stationary and nobody was in it but the ignition was on.

'I leant in to turn the ignition off and saw Ashley at the back entangled in the machinery. I panicked and called the emergency services. I didn’t know what to do.'

Coroner Jennifer Leeming recorded a verdict that Mr Dixon took his own life.

Ms Brooks, 23, said: 'Ashley was an amazing person inside and out. He was loving, caring, fun and he had an infectious smile that lit up any room he walked into. Ashley will always hold a special place in my heart. I will love him always and forever.'
