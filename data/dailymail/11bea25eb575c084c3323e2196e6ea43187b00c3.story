Guilty? Teresa Moses, 23 at the time of this 2006 mugshot, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 2010 of murder, torture and child abuse after her son, Raijon Daniels, 8, was found dead next to a pool of his own vomit

A San Francisco woman who tortured, abused and murdered her eight-year-old son is a free woman today, seven years after her little boy was found dead in a pool of his own vomit in 2006 and three years after she was sentenced.

Teresa Moses, 30, from Richmond, was declared not guilty by reason of insanity in 2010 for killing her son Raijon Daniels and has spent the last three years in a mental hospital receiving treatment for a condition that doctors have called 'fleeting'.

No longer deemed a risk to society, the rehabilitated mother has been placed in Contra Costa County's Forensic Conditional Release Program, known as Con-REP under which her continued recovery will be monitored closely. 

Ms Moses was mother to Raijon and a younger daughter who was placed in foster care while she awaited trial.

The news of Ms Moses' premature release will no doubt come as a shock to many who followed the story in 2006.

Ms Moses was charged with torture and child abuse after Raijon's body was discovered in her house on October 27th.

Autopsy reports showed that the boy had been beaten, scratched and starved and further investigation revealed that he had been locked in a bedroom in Ms Moses' house where he was strapped to the bed and watched by surveillance cameras.

Ms Moses was said to have used a high pressure water hose to wash feces off his body and forced her son to take baths in his own waste mixed with cleaning detergent Pine Sol to deter him from relieving himself. 

On the day of his death, she admitted to having poured the highly chemical product on his genitals.

Responding to news of her client's release on Saturday, deputy public defender, Stephanie Regular told Contra Costa Times: 'The incident which led to Ms. Moses' commitment is a horrible tragedy - a tragedy which Ms Moses will regret for the rest of her life.

'However, I also think it is important to remember that Ms Moses was legally insane at the time she committed the crime. The person she was then is not the person who she is now.'

Victim: Raijon Daniels, 8, was strapped to a bed by his mother who poured Pine Sol on his genitals, made him wash in his own waste and starved him

Ms Regular's claims were backed up by three doctors during the trial who all testified that Ms Moses was legally insane at the time of the torture.

A friend of the defendant who went to see her shortly after she was taken to hospital told the Contra Costa Times that Ms Moses was genuinely 'shocked' to hear of her son's death. She told her friend that she had learned her parenting skills from watching ants while growing up in the projects of Richmond.

'Of course, I thought she meant "aunts"', said the woman who preferred to remain anonymous. 'No, she meant the insects.'

Though Ms Moses' medical records are kept strictly private, she was described by one attorney as having paranoid delusions. Mr Butts quoted doctors in Napa as describing her condition as 'a mental illness than can be fleeting.'

Explaining the way the law treats insanity cases such as Ms Moses', deputy district attorney Derek Butts said: 'As unfortunate as it may be, a person can suffer a short period of insanity and not be held accountable for the crimes they commit, however heinous they may be.

'It is a difficult part of our justice system to accept, especially under circumstances such as these.'

He also added that a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict in a burglary case would be given the same punishment as a murder case.

The District Attorney's office raised objections to Ms Moses' release in February but since all the defendant's doctors at Napa State Hospital supported it and called her a ' model patient', Mr Butts did not pursue a trial.

For Ms Regular, the reversal has shown the remarkable way in which the mentally ill can be given a second chance provided they receive the right treatment and support. She referred to the agreement made between doctors, lawyers and judges, 'an insurmountable task.'

Sentenced: Ms Moses has served only three years in a mental hospital and has been released on the advice of doctors who called her mental condition at the time of the torture 'fleeting' and her transformation, remarkable

While Ms Moses' attorney and doctors 
have applauded her recovery and have pointed to her work with 'New 
Start', a program she co-facilitated at the hospital, her nameless 
friend has called her transformation 'remarkable'.

'For
her, being in Napa has been a real gift, and she took it as that,' she 
said. 'One of her graces is she really wanted to take responsibility and
wanted help and took advantage of every opportunity that she could.'

But one person struggling to understand the transformation so readily is Raijon's father, Desmond Daniels.

'How can three years pass and she be OK after the acts that she did? How could someone who put Pine-Sol in a child's food, allow a child to jump from a second-story building, how could they be a model patient?' he wonders.

'I still have so many questions.'

Still, even despite the way in which his young son's life ended, Mr Daniels has astonishingly found a way to forgive Ms Moses.

'In the beginning, I really wanted to see her suffer because she had made him suffer,' he admitted. "But I can't pass judgment, I wasn't in the home. I forgive her, as crazy as that may sound, because of the faith that I have. Who am I to beat her down and dog her?'
