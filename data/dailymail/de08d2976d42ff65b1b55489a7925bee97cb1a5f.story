It was acceptable in the Eighties. And now bright, eccentric jewellery from the decade of shoulder pads is making a comeback.

Giant hoop and drop earrings, extravagant torque bangles and sprung-collar necklaces were all the rage among power-dressing women more than 25 years ago.

The look, which is characterised by abstract design, yellow gold and colourful stones, was soon seen as tasteless but is now back in fashion, according to one auction house.

Bonhams has reported a surge in customers paying above estimate prices for the over-the-top jewellery.

Recent sales include £11,000 for an amethyst and ametrine choker, and £17,000 for a moonstone and gem set necklace, both by US designer Tony Duquette.

An 18 karat gold and diamond necklace by Cartier which was expected to sell for £5,000 went for £11,600.

A 1980 diamond and coloured diamond gem-set pendant sold for £19,400 - up 216 per cent on its estimate.

Bonhams believes the resurgence in Eighties bling is down to a new generation designers making jewellery which is convenient for both daytime and evening wear.

Collectors and investors are now reappraising key pieces by signature designers when they are sold at auction.

Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams, said: 'The beauty of the Eighties is that for many people it is still seen as the time that fashion forgot.

'There is definitely a feeling these designs have been unappreciated, even as recently as four or five years ago.

'Obviously that view is now changing when it comes to jewellery.

'Much of the jewellery from the Art Deco period is meant to be worn exclusively in the evening with a formal dress.

'But big, bold and stylish Eighties jewellery, with its unmistakable mix of stones and vibrant colour palette can be easily worn both during the day and at night.

'That makes it a versatile option for the time-poor business woman.

'Now is definitely the moment to dig out any Eighties jewellery you might have hidden away in a box and have a look. It could be worth trying on again or selling if you're still not convinced.'

Bonhams has compared sale figures of Eighties jewellery in 2010 versus this year and found pieces were now achieving an average of 70 per cent higher than estimated.

In some cases, the final price was 200 per cent higher than it was four years ago.

By comparison, some stunning lots of signed Eighties jewellery on sale in 2010 failed to reach their reserves, despite now being highly sought after and commanding top prices.
