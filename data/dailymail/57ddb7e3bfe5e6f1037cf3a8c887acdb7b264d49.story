Brian Copsey arriving at Southwark Crown Court, where he was sentenced to eight years in prison

A ‘charming’ accountant who stole more than £1million from his wealthy neighbours has been jailed for eight years.

Brian Copsey, 60, pretended to oversee refurbishments to a luxury mansion block near Marble Arch in West London, but spent residents’ savings on shopping sprees at Harrods, Tiffany and Selfridges.

He also splashed out on luxury  holidays and boarding school fees for one of his sons at £30,000-a-year Ampleforth College.

The father-of-three was chastised by a judge for his ‘gross breach of trust’ as he was jailed this week.

His neighbours at exclusive Bryanston Court, where Wallis Simpson, the wife of Edward VIII, once lived and where apartments are worth up to £4million, said the swindler had caused ‘turmoil’, with tenants turning on each other.

Copsey stole the money while living there with his wife of 14 years in a four-bedroom flat worth £3.7million.

He charmed his neighbours before being chosen to look after residents’ contributions to refurbishments by Bryanston Court Management, the group of tenants managing the flats.

Copsey, who lived there rent-free, forged bank documents to authorise service charges to be paid to his own companies.

He paid £250,000 into his own bank account and transferred nearly £80,000 to his children. His wife Caroline, 49, is said to have had more than £110,000, while £27,000 went on bills.

He told neighbours he had invested the money in a mining company called Anglo-African Minerals and then flew to Africa on a string of ‘business’ trips.

He was exposed when other members of the flats’ management board tried to start the refurbishments and found £1,160,525 had disappeared from the account. None of the residents in the 56 flats has been repaid.

One grandfather, who asked not to be named, said yesterday that he was ‘distraught’ at being conned. ‘We are all very upset,’ the businessman said. ‘Everyone has suffered. Everyone is shattered by what has happened. He forged our signatures.

‘He nicked it all. He was very charming so nobody suspected anything. He was always in smart suits but lied to us right from the beginning. We still haven’t received a penny back. There is a whole kerfuffle in the block about it. How can you trust anyone?’

Another branded Copsey’s eight-year sentence ‘ludicrous’ and said: ‘It should have been a lot longer.’

In impact statements read to Southwark Crown Court, it emerged that one victim was 97 while another has suffered stress-related Bell’s Palsy as a result of the deception.

Copsey, originally from New Zealand, lost his own fortune in poor business dealings before he started the scam, which ran between March 2010 and  September 2012.

He was found guilty of fraud by abuse of his position, and was also disqualified from being a company director for 12 years.

Judge John Price told him: ‘The victims are ordinary people who lost about £30,000 each. Neighbour has turned against neighbour. You have done all of that – you destroyed the feeling of good neighbourliness that was in the flats.’

Detective Constable Julie Jode, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ‘Despite the revelations, Mr Copsey continued to live among his victims with no apparent shame or remorse.’
