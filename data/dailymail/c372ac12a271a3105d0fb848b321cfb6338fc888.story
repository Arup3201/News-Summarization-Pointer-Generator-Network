For over a decade, she has been almost as much of a  television personality as her owner.

From being cast away on a remote Scottish island to appearing on a chat show couch with Sophia Loren, Ben Fogle's labrador Inca was rarely far from his side.

He even met his future wife Marina while both were walking their dogs.

But as all pet owners know, such a close bond makes the final passing all the more painful.

And yesterday the 38-year-old presenter said he couldn't stop crying after having to take Inca to the vet to be put down at the age of 12. 'I just lost my best friend, Inca,' he wrote on Twitter. 'Heartbroken doesn't even begin to describe it.'.

Earlier he had posted: 'Sometimes you have to make decisions that break your heart.'

Inca had required a £5,000-a-year cocktail of medication after being diagnosed with epilepsy and arthritis.

Marina, who has two children with Fogle – Ludo, two, and 13-month-old Iona, said yesterday: 'If it wasn't for Inca, Ben and I would never have met walking our dogs in Hyde Park. On top of our wedding cake we had figurines of our dogs. That is how special they have been to us.'

Mr Fogle said he has not stopped crying since Inca had to be put down at the age of 12

She added: 'It is terribly sad. Inca suffered from epilepsy, which we controlled with medication, but we decided that  as soon as she wasn't enjoying life any more we would let her  go humanely.

'The day before she died we took her to the beach with my dog, Maggi. She couldn't walk but she lay in the sand and watched the sea. In the end, it was very peaceful.'

Fogle has regularly told of the close bond he shared with Inca and Maggi. 'Their enthusiasm is infectious and we feel at ease and relaxed after spending time with them,' he said two years ago. 'They complete our family.'

Fogle shot to fame 12 years ago as one of 36 unknowns who spent a year on the island of Taransay for BBC reality show Castaway 2000.

Allowed one luxury, he opted to bring Inca, whom he had bought as a puppy for £1,500, picking a name inspired by his recent travels to South America.

Fogle has gone on to present BBC shows including Crufts, One Man and His Dog and Countryfile.

He
also followed Princes William and Harry on their first joint Royal tour
in Botswana and made a documentary called Prince William’s Africa.

The former magazine picture editor and his pet were an immediate hit with viewers. In her youth, he described her as a 'camera tart', needing her own dressing room when they appeared on Graham Norton's chat show because fellow guest Sophia Loren was scared of dogs.

In 2004 the presenter revealed: 'She's incredibly well-behaved unless food is involved. Then she forgets everything: her training, her manners.'

After one magazine photoshoot in which his mobile phone number was visible on Inca's collar, Fogle received more  than 3,000 texts and calls  from women.

Last year Fogle told how he had twisted his ankle seeing off a fox which had tried to attack Inca near his London home.

The TV presenter took Inca as his 'luxury item' when he travelled to the isle of Taransay for BBC show Castaway

The
father-of-two said he took Inca, his other dog Maggi and his 
mother-in-law’s pet Beca - all labradors - out for a late night walk in a
private square when it pounced.

'The
younger two dogs are pretty sprightly, but Inca is 11 and is very slow 
and epileptic which causes her a bit of arthritis,' he said at the time.

'It was a very large dog fox - the size of my dogs.

'When I first saw it I actually thought it was a dog.'

He was yesterday too upset to talk about Inca’s death, but followers took to Twitter to express their sympathy.

One posted: 'Oh no! I’m so sorry. How terribly sad.'
