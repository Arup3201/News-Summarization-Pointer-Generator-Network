A glamorous British fashion designer and former model who triumphed over breast cancer and a double mastectomy has appeared topless in a courageous photoshoot. 

Claire Farwell, 45, a mother-of-two from Devonshire, England beat the disease, which affects one in 8 women in the UK, and decided to proudly reveal her post-operation body, scars and all.

She was inspired by the Scar Project, a 126-page book containing 50 portraits of young breast cancer survivors, shot by fashion photographer David Jay.

'He took these amazing documentary type photographs, but I felt it was so sad. Some were crying,’ she explains.

'While it’s a beautiful project, I didn't want that, I wanted to say "here I am!" I wanted to do a shoot about how I feel as a person, not what I look like.

In 2012 Claire bravely agreed to appear in a series of black and white photos - shot by renowned photographer Byron Atienza. 

'I realised I did not for one second feel any less of a woman from having my breasts taken away,’ she said. ‘I feel even more of a woman today than ever! 

'I don't look (at the photos) and say, ‘I wish I had a nipple’. I don't have nipples and I’ve got used to looking like a Barbie doll.'

Despite the pain and heartbreak she suffered during her battle with breast cancer, Claire is adamant it has changed her life for the better.

Today, the former fashion model – who lived and worked with Naomi Campbell in Paris in the 80s - runs her own fashion label while juggling life as a mother and wife.

She took part in in campaigns alongside 
Claudia Schiffer and Naomi Campbell for Gianfranco Ferrè, Nivea and Speedo,
 and appeared in French Elle and Vogue.

But despite her stylish background, the idea for her own label didn't come about until October 2011, when, while still in remission, Claire organised a fund raising event to raise money for breast cancer charities.

'I said, "let’s put on a party! Let’s make money for breast cancer." So I threw an event for 300 people, and thought it made sense to do a fashion show.’ 

But when she didn’t like what local designers had to offer, she took matters into her own hands. 

With no formal design training, Claire made 24 dresses by hand, which appeared on the catwalk and were then sold at auction.

She adds: ‘People told me, "you need to do this full time!" so I did!’ 

In 2012 Claire Farwell London was launched – described on the website as ‘elegant, comfortable and unique designs with a British accent.’

Important: Claire says her topless shoot post breast cancer is the most important she's ever done

'It’s for the practical, cheeky and classy woman, who lives life and tells her story through fashion,' explains Claire.

'My label featured in Nolcha Fashion Week – part of New York Fashion Week last year – that never would have happened if I hadn’t fought cancer and won.

'Breast cancer gave me this creativity, and now I’m building a brand I’m so passionate about.'

An online store is to come next and Hollywood celebrities such as Eva Longoria and Carrie Keagan have been spotted in her designs. 

But it has been a long and rocky journey for Claire since being diagnosed with breast cancer in November of 2009 aged 40.

'I had been feeling really, really tired, so I decided to go to the doctors for a check-up,' she remembers.

'I’ve always been healthy, so I knew by the way I was feeling that something was wrong.'

Tests confirmed that her Vitamin D levels were dangerously low - a common symptom of cancer.

Claire has a mammogram in December of 2009, and shortly afterwards, results from a biopsy confirmed she had breast cancer.

‘I remember the moment they told me,’ she adds. ‘I was in a clothes store, naked, complaining that I couldn’t wear a beautiful, low backed top, because I’d have to wear a bra. And then the doctor rang. You drop everything when the doctor calls.’ 

Doctors insisted on a lumpectomy to determine whether the cancer had spread. The results were unclear, so Claire had the mastectomy.

'I had the choice to have a single mastectomy,' she said. 'But I opted for the double mastectomy. For me I don't want to worry psychologically about the other one.'

Despite enduring a five-hour operation to remove her breasts in February 2010, she opted to have reconstructive surgery just two months later.

Positive: Claire, pictured with husband Gus (left) and in her modelling days, says she feels very lucky

'My husband and I would joke: “How big shall we go?” You have to see the humour, otherwise what’s the point? I have no feeling in my nipples at all, that's a shame. I don't have any nipples.

'When the doctors asked, “do you want to keep your nipples?” I joked, 'How on earth will I do Playboy!” And then I thought, why the hell wouldn't I be able to do Playboy—if I wanted? Why shouldn’t I stand there with my boobs out and say "I feel incredible"!'

'I had cancer the size of a golf ball, and I got through it, with a joke and a smile. And I couldn’t have got through it without my husband and girls.'

Claire now lives in Los Angeles, California with her husband Gus, 36, a former American football player turned opera singer and their daughters Devon, seven, and Avalon, six.

‘I chose not to hide myself from my girls. You just come to realise it won’t be like you were before and you move forward.

'I feel so positive today,’ she adds. ‘If I’d have waited a year to get the mastectomy, I’d probably be dead.

'There are women younger than me who have died because they weren’t as lucky. Cancer makes you realise that you need to be yourself, be the woman that you want to be. I’m so proud of my photos, the most important photographs of my career.'
