A former cub scout who was molested as a nine-year-old by Jimmy Savile has said he blamed himself for the 36 years that he kept it a secret.

Kevin Cook, now 45, appeared on Jim'll Fix It with the TV star in 1976 after members of his cub pack wrote in to the show.

Mr Cook, the presenter's youngest alleged victim, said he was lured to a dressing room with the promise of receiving a coveted badge for appearing on the programme.

But while in the room, Savile asked him whether he was ready to 'earn your badge' before molesting him then getting him to touch him through his trousers.

He originally spoke out about the ordeal on Sunday after telling his wife about the abuse - the first person he had ever told - last Thursday.

Speaking today, he said he was motivated by the courage of others who have come forward in the wake of the scandal.

He told This Morning: 'All these years I have had it with me I thought I was the only one. I blamed myself for what had happened.'

Mr Cook appeared on the show with members of the 44th Newham East cub pack.

After filming for the show, the married father-of-two said he was on stage with the others cubs when Savile approached him to thank him for giving him a tie which his mother had passed on as a present.

'We were all on the stage. That's when Jimmy came up to me and thanked me for the tie and asked me if I would like my own badge, which of course I agreed to', he said.

Mr Cook was led off down a corridor in to a 'dingy' dressing room where Savile pulled out a chair, asked him to sit down and then touched him.

At one point he said a man walked in to the room, saw what was happening, said 'Oops', and then closed the door shut.

He said: 'After I’d done my shorts up Jimmy warned me not to tell anyone. He said “Don’t even tell your mates. We know where you live. Nobody would believe you anyway – I’m King Jimmy”.’

Mr Cook, who now lives in an Essex coastal town said the threat had always haunted him.

He added: 'The threat was always there and when you finally read and you hear about it and there's other people, it makes it easier to tell.'

When asked if he regretted not speaking about it before, he said: 'I wish (I had). That's the regret because obviously he's passed away and nothing can be done.

'But I wish I came forward years ago.'

He said he was close to telling his cub leader a few months after the incident in the 70s but in the end decided not to.

Asked how he felt about Savile now, he responded: 'I hate the man, nothing but anger towards him, and bitter that he died and he can't face the music.

'But I also think that all the work that he's done, all the charity work, i just think that was a sham and the disguise to hide what he's been up to and he's got away with it.'

He said 'I feel a different person now' after telling his family and police about the sexual abuse.

Meanwhile another photograph emerged today of Savile nearby a Jersey care home where 192 youngsters allegedly suffered abuse.

Television presenter and ChildLine 
founder Esther Rantzen denied again today that she ignored allegations 
about Savile from an anti-child abuse campaigner.

Ms Rantzen, who fronted the BBC 
programme That's Life, told This Morning that she had only ever heard 
'rumours' about Savile, whose alleged crimes were revealed in an ITV 
documentary.

She said: 'As Ian Hislop said so 
brilliantly last week, knowledge means that you hear from the person it 
happened to or a witness and that’s what the ITV documentary showed me.

'Up until then, I’ve heard rumours 
about the royal family, politicians, about TV presenters and my view 
about rumours is the vast majority of the rumours are untrue. So I 
didn’t know anything.'

Ms Rantzen said she had 'no memory' of being contacted by campaigner Shy Keenan who said she told her about Savile.

The presenter added: 'Now the lady 
who says that she told me 18 years ago - I’ve gone back through the 
records of that year to see if we ever did an item about child abuse in 
that series of That’s Life...she says she met me then.

'I have no memory of her at all. And 
we did one item about child abuse in that series and it was about 
criminal compensation...the other members of That’s Life staff have no 
memory of her.'

Jimmy Savile is captured for the first time in the room of his flat at Stoke Mandeville hospital where it is alleged he took nurses before and after he abused patients on the wards.

He began volunteering as a porter there 
in the 1970s and had free use of a flat on site while he helped to raise
£40 million for its spinal injuries centre.

A former patient at the hospital, Rebecca Owen, had previously told of how nurses at the hospital knew about his behaviour and were apprehensive about his visits.

Ms Owen said she heard a conversation between nurses.

'It was an air of resignation that you had to put up with,' she said.

'There was some sort of ironic chatter between the nurses about who would be the lucky one to go off to his room.

'And then, as one of the nurses was leaving or passing by my bed, she leant over and said the best thing you can do is stay in bed until he’s gone and pretend to be asleep.'
