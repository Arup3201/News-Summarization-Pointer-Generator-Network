A teenager who smashed into a condo during a terrifying para-sailing accident last summer has spoken out for the first time to reveal her grueling recovery.

Sidney Good, 17, was left in critical condition alongside friend Alexis Fairchild on July 1 when their parasail snapped free from its boat in Panama City, Florida, leaving the girls soaring through the air.

In an ordeal that was captured on camera by horrified holidaymakers, the girls were heard screaming as they were 
left to the mercy of the wind and thrown against the 13th floor of a condominium.

'I remember seeing the people on the 
balcony that we hit,' Sidney recounted to Good Morning America. 'I remember
 them grabbing for me and after that I blacked out.'

Hurt: Seventeen-year-old Sidney Good, pictured in hospital last year, has spoken out for the first time since she was left in critical condition in a terrifying para-sailing accident in Florida last summer

Faith: She is pictured praying in the hospital with her parents. She said her belief in God got her through

After hitting the balcony, they were 
thrown into the air again and eventually collided with power lines 
before landing on top of a car in a nearby parking lot.

Both girls suffered head trauma and lacerations. Alexis had serious back injuries and Sidney suffered broken vertebrae and brain trauma.

'About the second day, my body was preparing itself to die,' Sidney said.

Her father, Eric, added that doctors were unsure if she had sustained the injuries when she hit the building or when she fell on top of the car.

They underwent multiple operations for their injuries, and Alexis was eventually able to leave Bay Medical Center in Panama City, Florida in mid-July while Sidney remained for a further week.

'Thanks to all who's prayed,' Alexis said on her Twitter account after she was released. 'I'm just thankful to be coming home and blessed to be doing as good as I am!'

Best friends: Sidney, right, was hurt with her friend Alexis Fairchild, left, while on vacation in Florida last July. Their para-sail detached from its boat, sending them smashing into a condo

Terrifying: Footage taken from the beach showed the girls hitting the condo and then taking off again

Horror: They flew through the air and eventually hit a power line and dropped on top of a car

Hurt: The girls landed on this parked car in a nearby parking lot and were rushed to hospital

Both girls have now returned home to Huntington, Indiana, where they have continued to undergo treatment as out patients.

Sidney spoke to GMA over the phone as she said it is still too early to appear on camera.

She also revealed that doctors do not expect her to make a full recovery; she has double vision constantly and her peripheral vision is totally gone - but says she still hopes she graduates this year.

When asked what helped her survive the ordeal, she said: 'I'm a very strong believer in God.'

Alexis' family is now suing the company, Aquatic Adventures, the largest para-sail firm in the U.S. The company said it is unable to comment on ongoing litigation.

They became detached from the boat 
when their boat dropped anchor due to unusually high and dangerous winds
 and their line snapped.

Recovery: The girls, pictured before the accident, both needed multiple surgeries after suffering head trauma

Life-changing: Sidney has lost some of her vision and doctors do not expect her to make a full recovery

'These two little girls were just 
screaming bloody murder,' said witness Rick McGee to Indiana News 
Center. 'I could see they were going to contact the condo, and they did 
strike it on the gulf side.'

'It was heading towards the condos and they were screaming and it was - it was horrific,' another witness, Inga Bobbin, told WJHG.

'And they hit the building and then they stopped screaming and it was awful. Everybody was trying to get to them and nobody could do anything.'

Earlier in the day, Alexis had taken to Twitter to speak of her delight at her vacation on the Gulf shores, writing: 'Beach Day!! Its seriously sooo beautiful here!'

She later added that they were going parasailing, writing: 'Freaking out.'

Family: Sidney's father Eric said doctors did not know if the teenager suffered her life-changing injuries as she hit the building or when she and Alexis fell on top of a car in a parking lot
