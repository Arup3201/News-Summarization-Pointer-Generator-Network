Germany international Christoph Kramer says it was an 'enormous honour' to be linked with a move to Real Madrid, but he is keeping his options open for next season.

The 23-year-old is currently in the second of a two-year loan spell at Borussia Monchengladbach, who have expressed their interest in making the move a permanent one when he is due to return to Bayer Leverkusen in the summer.

Leverkusen expect him to come back to them and Kramer says he would have no problems doing that, although he admits he is attracted by a move abroad.

'Of course (going back to Leverkusen) is an option for me,' he told the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper.

'They have a good coach in Roger Schmidt and they play an attractive style of football which would also suit me.'

Gladbach's brand of football is also to Kramer's liking, yet he would like something which challenges him even more, such as a new country and a new culture.

'That has always interested me,' he said. 'I would not be afraid of (going abroad).

'I want to find out what my limit is and I always strive for the very best.'

One option might be Real Madrid, who have already been linked with a move for the World Cup winner.

'I wish I had cut out and hung that article on my wall,' Kramer said. 'To be linked with Real Madrid is an enormous honour for me.'

Meanwhile, Kramer has been forced to pull out of Germany's squad to face Gibraltar on Friday night and Spain on Tuesday due to a back injury.
