A Barbie book titled I Can Be a Computer Engineer has triggered outrage over the seemingly 'sexist' and patronizing message it sends to young girls.

The $4 book, which was published by Random House and is aimed at three to seven-year-olds sees Barbie - supposedly a computer engineer - make a number of technical blunders before turning to her male friends to fix her issues.

'It's incomprehensible how misogynistic it is,' reads one of the book's many overwhelmingly negative Amazon reviews.

The book, written by author Susan Marenco and published in July 2013, opens with Barbie 'hard at work' on her laptop, as she explains to her sister Skipper: 'I'm only creating the design ideas. I'll need Steven's and Brian's help to turn it into a real game!'

One irate reviewer writes on Amazon: 'Literally six sentences into the story, and already Barbie can NOT do it.

'She immediately admits she doesn't know how to actually do computer engineering, and like a Disney princess, needs a white knight to rescue her.'

The next scene sees Barbie get hit with a 'weird' virus on her laptop, before borrowing her sister's computer to finish her work, only to inadvertently infect hers too.

Having lost all of Skipper's 'unsaved' homework and music files, Barbie announces she is sorry, but she has to 'run off to school now.'

Skipper 'playfully hits Barbie with a pillow,' and Barbie heads to school for a computer lesson from her glamorous female computer teacher.

But alas, things don't start looking up until she turns to her two male friends for help.

Speed is of the essence: Despite taking a computer lesson as school, things don't start looking up until Barbie enlists the help of two male friends (pictured) who can fix the issue 'faster'

'It will go faster if Brian and I help,' suggests Steven, before he and Brian fix the virus and retrieve all of Skipper's files. Barbie then heads home to 'surprise' her sister with the good news.

'You are just too cool Barbie! You fixed my computer and saved my homework!' Skipper exclaims.

Reviewer Rachel Appel points out: 'Barbie takes 100per cent of the credit for fixing something to which she contributed nothing.'

She adds: 'I work as a software engineer, which is a male dominated field. 

'It is exactly these stereotypes and portrayals of girls like the one in this book that are the driving force behind the lack of girls wanting to enter these lucrative technology fields.'

Another reviewer, also a computer engineer, writes: 'As the father of two daughters who are both in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, my only recommendation for this book would be to set it on fire.'

The only customer to defend the book, wrote: 'All you feminists in uproar over Barbie asking for her male friends' help in this book don't even fit the profile for buying a Barbie book.

'It's called free speech! Not every woman is just as competent as some men in certain areas and vice versa.'

One female computer programmer by the name of Kathleen Tuite, based in Santa Cruz, California, set up a comical blog entitled Feminist Hacker Barbie, which invites users to re-write pages from the book.

Poking fun: Another user puts their spin on the inflammatory children's book (pictured) 

'Barbie's new book tells girls they need boys to code for them,' the site's description reads. 'Help Barbie be the competent, independent, bad-ass engineer that she wants to be.'

Submissions include Barbie, rather that turning to her male friends for help, suggesting: 'It will go faster if you boys just get out of here and let me work. Maybe make a Taco Bell run?'

In a statement made to MailOnline today, a Barbie representative said: 'This book was published in 2010. Since that time we have reworked our Barbie books. 

'The portrayal of Barbie in this specific story doesn’t reflect the Brand’s vision for what Barbie stands for. We believe girls should be empowered to understand that anything is possible and believe they live in a world without limits. 

'We apologize that this book didn’t reflect that belief. All Barbie titles moving forward will be written to inspire girls imaginations and portray an empowered Barbie character.'
