There are some social situations where it might be advantageous if your clothes could enable you to merge into your surroundings and save you from an unwelcome encounter.

Now one textile designer in Budapest has taken the first steps to creating clothing that can change colour like a chameleon.

Her experimental fabric can change colour in seconds using a number of electronic devices.

Indecisive: A textile designer in Budapest has created experimental fabric (pictured) that can change colour in seconds like a chameleon as it is filled with electronics

Judit Eszter Karpati created the interactive fabric using computer programming, engineering and electronic devices.

‘My main interest in textile design is the dynamically changing surfaces, structures, integrating interactive technologies into textiles. In my works I’m looking for new ways of interaction between human and textile,’ she wrote on her blog.

The fabric, which comprises her Chromosonic research project, consists of ‘arduino [a microcontroller] with 12V power supply and 20 custom PCBs [printed circuit boards] driving and controlling 4 industrial 24V DC power supplies, that heat two handmade textile woven with nichrome wires and screen-printed with thermochromatic dying, revealing the pre-programmed patterns.’

The lizards have specialized cells - chromatophores - which contain pigments in their cytoplasm, in three layers below their transparent outer skin, but the fabric uses electronics to change colour

Making a mark: Patterns on the fabric are generated from sound files and heat. People also can leave traces on the surface by touching it (pictured)

She created her fabric to turn digital media into textile art.

‘Chromosonic research project investigates how the world of digital media becomes tangible through the textile medium. My intention was the broadening the field of textile craft and design to media design.’

Two slow moving textile ‘displays’ show the content. They react to environmental changes such as heat and pressure by changing colour and pattern.

Ms Karpati writes: ‘Patterns appear on woven, flexible textile, integrated electronic devices.

‘The patterns are generated from sound files. The heat sensitive static patterns create dynamically changing patterns. The spectators also can leave traces on the surface through the sense of touch.’

She told MailOnline:’ I think that in the future it can be developed to the next level, to become wearable, involving more experts from electronics and the IT sector.

‘But it wasn't my intention as it is an installation. I think it provides many opportunities for further reflection and it can be a food for thought.’

Fashion fast forward: Ms Karpati told MailOnline that one day her innovation could be developed to the next level to become wearable, involving more experts from electronics and the IT sector to embed the necessary electronics (pictured) into the main body of the fabric

She plans on working with IT experts and engineers to develop the fabric further, but at the moment it is 'food for thought'
