A convicted sex offender was employed at a hospital after Criminal Records Bureau checks weren't passed on, it emerged today.

The unnamed person found work at Southend Hospital in Essex through an agency before being dismissed in June last year.

Responding to a Freedom of Information request, the hospital said the agency worker was hired to provide optician services.

It said the offender saw eight children between April and June.

The hospital's director of nursing Sue Hardy told BBC News: 'It was when the trust queried the individual's qualifications
we were informed that he was on the sex offenders' register having been
convicted of a crime of a sexual nature involving another adult.

'We were confident that there was no risk to our patients and the individual concerned was capable of performing his job.

'We were confident that there was no risk to our patients and the individual concerned was capable of performing his job.

'However, we informed the independent 
contractor that, given this individual was employed in a position of 
trust and was providing direct health services to potential vulnerable 
groups, we could not allow him to work for us in this capacity.'

The hospital has not ruled out further investigations into the case or possible legal action.

It said it was now trying to establish
'whether a person (or persons) failed to comply with the law and/or 
with trust policy in relation to the contractor's recruitment of the 
(Sex Offender's Register) registered person.'

'The trust is not aware of any recent 
offence having been committed or of any offence having been committed 
whilst on trust premises by the registered person,' a spokeswoman said.

'We were confident that there was no risk to our patients and the individual concerned was capable of performing his job.'

'In this case, the contractor did undertake the CRB check but did not inform the trust of its outcome or hiring decision. For this reason, the trust has stopped the company trading on the hospital's site.

'We are satisfied that all the children seen were accompanied by a responsible adult.'

The hospital has not named the agency involved, citing the Data Protection Act.

A spokesman for patient support group Essex and Southend LINk told BBC News it was vital agencies made the results of CRB checks known to hospitals.

Peter Blackman said: 'It's absolutely imperative that agencies have up-to-date, enhanced CRB checks in place and if they are not clear, the information about the individual is brought to the attention of the organisation wanting to hire them.'

Southend's Local Safeguarding Children Board has previously stated it was aware of the case.
