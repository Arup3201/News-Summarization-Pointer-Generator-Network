Swedish superstore Ikea has recalled nearly three million baby bed canopies over fears they could strangle children.

The furniture maker took action today after receiving reports of young children becoming entangled in the product.

The company has asked parents who have bought the canopies, which look like mosquito nets and are designed to be draped over a child's bed, to stop using them immediately.

Ikea spokeswoman Ylva Magnusson said: 'We have had some reports of young children getting entangled in these canopies.'

She said some children have suffered minor injuries as a result of getting caught in the canopies.

'However there is no child that has had permanent injuries ... and as a safety measure we are recalling the products,' she added.

The company asked customers who have bought the canopies to return them to Ikea stores around the world for a full refund.

'We apologise for any possible inconvenience this may cause, but safety is always the highest priority for Ikea,' the company added in a statement listing eight different canopy models.

The worldwide recall concerns more than 2.8 million products sold since 1996.

The affected models are Legendarisk, Minnen bed canopy set, Barnslig Boll, Minnen Brodyr, Himmel, Fabler, Tissla and Klammig.

Ikea gave no explanation as to why the products were on the market for so long before a recall was deemed necessary.

Apology: A spokeswoman for the company said any parent whose child has the mosquito net-like canopy hanging above their bed, should stop using the product and return it to their nearest store
