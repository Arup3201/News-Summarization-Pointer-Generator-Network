Her name may be unfamiliar to some but Emily Skye's drive for a fitter, healthier and happier lifestyle is what's gained her a following of more than three million on social media.

The Australian personal trainer, from the Gold Coast - southeastern Queensland, has about 70,000 girls worldwide following her clean eating and fitness program.

But she's spoken to Daily Mail Australia to share her top tips for summer while also unveiling some of the most common health and fitness misconceptions.

The 29-year-old turned her life around five years ago when she decided to make the switch to cleaner eating

Now the Gold Coast personal trainer has more than three million followers across social media

Australian fitness guru Emily Skye shares her top five tips for staying healthy this season:

1) Plan ahead - prepare healthy meals the night before which will help prevent the urge to buy processed and unhealthy alternatives;

2) Cut back on sugar - stay away from packaged foods and opt for veges, lean meats or nuts;

3) Don't be afraid of full fats - the low fat option sold in supermarkets usually contains more salt, sugar and other chemicals;

4) Choose meals with high protein - if you're out for a meal, go for the fish, chicken or beef with a side of salad or veges. Always ask for the sauce or topping to be served on the side;

5) Limit your alcohol intake - stay away from pre-made alcoholic drinks and instead have a beverage with less sugar like a vodka with soda water and a squeeze of lime. A red or white wine every now and then is okay too.

The 29-year-old wasn't always a fitness guru.

The former model recalls her troubled days when she had terrible eating habits and very rarely exercised. This took a toll on her physical and mental health.

Leaving the industry behind in search for happiness, she became intrigued in the latest 'fitspo' craze circulating social media.

And it's been five years since she made the switch to a healthier lifestyle by exercising regularly and eating unprocessed, clean foods. Since then, she's never looked back.

But unlike some diets, Ms Skye also enjoys eating desserts, carbohydrates and other fatty foods - without the guilt.

She doesn't count calories because she knows her regular fitness regime and balanced diet is what keeps her in shape.  

'When I was modelling, I thought all fats and carbs were the enemy but it's silly to cut them out because your body needs them,' she said.

'It's funny when people get surprised when they see me eating a desserts or chips. These are okay as long as you have a balanced diet and it's all done in moderation.'

This summer Ms Skye encourages others to plan ahead of time and prepare their healthy meals the night before to help prevent the urge to buy processed fast foods the following day.

'It's also important to cut back on sugars and basically stay away from anything in a packet as a general rule of thumb,' she said.

Other tips include steering clear of 'low-fat' products as Ms Skye says these usually contain a lot of salt, sugar or other chemicals.

'Also don't be afraid to go out for a meal when dieting,' she said.

'You can still enjoy a night out and choose meals that a high in protein like fish, chicken, beef, beans or anything with good fats with a side of salad or veges. But always ask for the sauce or topping to be served separately as restaurants tend to drench your meal in this stuff.'

With the holiday season just around the corner, Ms Skye also urges party-goers to hold back on the alcohol.

'Stay away from the pre-made lolly drinks because it's better to have something with less sugar like a vodka with soda water and a squeeze of lime,' she said.

For the personal trainer, her main goal is to reach out to more teenage girls worldwide to help them build their self confidence

Ms Skye says it's important to set goals but they must be realistic.

'It's good to have smaller goals along the way to help you reach your ultimate one,' she said.

For the personal trainer, her main aim is to reach out to more teenage girls worldwide to help them build their confidence and learn to love themselves.

'I'm drawn to teens because that's when I was at my lowest point,' Ms Skye said.

And she's already doing this by motivating and inspiring her followers through social media platforms.

'Since I became healthier and fitter, I almost feel like I've found life again,' she said.

'I feel set free and have a much more positive outlook so I want to share this with everyone.' 

FIB 1: EATING CARBS AT NIGHT WILL MAKE YOU FAT

FACT: 'Eating carbs at night won't make you fat, nor will it stop you losing fat. It all comes down to what you eat and how much you eat each day.'

FIB 2: LONG, SLOW CARDIO SESSIONS ARE THE BEST FOR BURNING FAT

FACT: 'Weights and high intensity training for a shorter period of time is definitely the most effective way to burn fat. You'll burn fat for up to 24 hours after you finish training compared to only around an hour or two after slow cardio.'

FIB 3: IF YOU WANT TO LOSE FAT – THEN EAT LESS

FACT: 'When it comes to getting your fat percentage down, you don't necessarily need to eat less. Sometimes you may even need to eat more!' Emily says what you eat is so much more important than how much you eat. Giving your body a good balance of nutrients is far more important than the size of your meals.

FIB 4: EATING FAT WILL MAKE YOU FAT

FACT: 'Fat will not make you fat. Good fats give you energy, help rebuild cells and helps to produce hormones.' Emily advises that you should avoid consuming saturated fats (excluding coconut oil) and trans fats. 'Also avoid low fat foods as they are usually choc-full of sugar and chemicals.'

FIB 5: WOMEN BULK UP IF THEY LIFT WEIGHTS

FACT: Weights shape and sculpt your body, whilst also burning fat and unless you're taking some serious supplements, they will never make you look masculine or bulky. According to Emily, it takes a lot of deliberate effort with your training and diet to get even close to bulking up, so unless you're trying to get bulky, you simply won't be able to.

FIB 6: YOU NEED TO CRUNCH YOUR WAY TO ROCK HARD ABS

FACT:  'You can do all the abdominal work you like but if you don't eat clean and do full body exercises to remove the layer of fat that covers your abs, then you'll never achieve the desired definition.'

FIB 7: STRENGTH TRAINING IS DANGEROUS

FACT: Whether you're strength training or doing cardio, all exercises are dangerous if they're not done correctly. As long as you learn proper technique strength training, it is completely safe and a really important part of any fitness plan.

FIB 8: THE SCALES TELL ALL

FACT: The scales only tell you how much your total weight is, not how lean you are. So the best way to track progress is by how you look, how your clothes fit and by taking a measure of your total body fat.

FIB 9: THE LONGER YOU SWEAT, THE BETTER YOU'LL GET

FACT:  'Overtraining can actually cause your body stress and it can even go into fight or flight mode which can cause it to store fat. Focusing on efficient workouts, good nutrition, adequate sleep and rest will give you the best shot at getting the best results.'

FIB 10: YOU BURN MORE FAT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH

FACT: This is really a personal preference. A lot of people don't tend to train as vigorously when they have an empty stomach and tend to binge after training. Fuelling your body a few hours before exercising with nutritious food will have a much greater impact on your fat burning potential as you have more energy to push through your workout.
