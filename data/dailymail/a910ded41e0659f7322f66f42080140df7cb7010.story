It was an intimate outback wedding for the happy couple's closest family and friends.

But as Gemma Ludgate and John Hancock exchanged vows, there was one person noticeable by  her absence - the groom's mother Gina Rinehart.

The mining magnate, Australia's richest person, had been locked in a bitter battle with her 38-year-old son and his siblings for control of the family's multi-billion dollar trust fund.  

John Hancock and his long-term partner, Gemma Ludgate, wedded in an intimate ceremony in Pilbara, Western Australia

The couple married on April 30 at Pibara, in Western Australia, the beautiful country setting  synonymous with the groom's late grandfather Lang Hancock, Sydney Private reported.

They only invited 50 guests, including Mr Hancock's good friend Olympian Grant Hackett.

The happy couple have been engaged for eight years and have two children together, aged seven and four.

Photos of the wedding were published on Monday by Woman's Day after the newlyweds struck a deal with the magazine.

'My relationship with my mum is complex … but I thank her for helping me become the man I am today,' the Perth-based mining consultant and derivatives trader told the magazine.

He said Ms Rinehart had influenced his choice of location for his 'Pilbara Adventure' wedding at Oxer Lookout in Hancock Gorge, 1,400 kilometres north-east of Perth.

The groom said it was his grandfather's and mother's favourite spot, and wanted to share it with friends.

The guests at the April wedding did not include Mr Hancock's mining magnate mother, Gina Rinehart

The only member of his immediate family who was present for the wedding was John's sister, Bianca, who joined in on the wedding part at the Karijini Eco Retreat in the Karijini National Park.

It is not the first time Ms Rinehart was not included in her children's wedding celebrations.

Last year Bianca wedded in Hawaii, without her mother's knowledge.

Mr Hancock's other sisters, Ginia and Hope, were also absent from the wedding.

The mining heiress and three of her children have been feuding over the trust fund since 2011.

The trio have been trying to wrestle control of the fund, which they are all beneficiaries, from Ms Rinehart.

Only one of her children, Ginia, sided with the matriarch.

Despite multiple attempts to suppress details of the court action, it was revealed Ms Rinehart had pushed the release date of the funds to her children back by more than 50 years - which sparked the feud.

It was estimated the fund was worth at least $2.4 billion in 2012 - when the children were due to become billionaires.

The fund was set up by Lang Hancock and controls almost a quarter of Hancock Prospecting Proprietary Limited.

Ms Rinehart has since bowed out of her role as trustee and Hope has withdrawn from the court action.

Mr Hancock and his sister, Bianca, continue to battle their mother in the New South Wales Supreme Court, alleging their mother had acted dishonestly in her role as trustee.

A new trustee is yet to be appointed.

The Ludgates relationship with the mining family has spanned generations.

In the 1950s, Lang Hancock would take to the skies in a small, single-engine plane and fly 400km from his station, Mulga Downs, to the Ludgates' station just to use the landline to make overseas business calls as the coaxial cable ended there at that time.

About 60 years later, Gemma Ludgate donned a white Aurelio Costarella gown and an impressive strand of borrowed pearls to wed Lang's grandson.

Mr Hancock was less formal in a pair of khaki drill pants, an open collared white shirt and a pair of RM Williams boots.

Guests dined on a banquet of lamb and pig on the spit on cane chairs under the stars.

Proceeds from the deal with Woman's Day went to the Royal Flying Doctor Service - where Mr Hancock was named a board member earlier in the year.
