Joey Barton admits that if Queens Park Rangers are to survive in the Premier League then they’ll have to do all of the hard work at Loftus Road.

Harry Redknapp’s bottom-placed side have lost all six matches on the road this term with an aggregate score of 2-15.

Their latest away-day reverse came at Barton’s former club Newcastle at the weekend as they went down to a 1-0 defeat.

At home they have fared slightly better, picking up eight points from a possible 18, and they face fellow strugglers Leicester City in the capital on Saturday.

And, after another below-par display away from West London, Barton concedes that fortunes at home will determine their top-flight fate.

‘You’ve got to pick yourself up in this league very quickly,’ said the 32-year-old, who skippered the team at St James’ Park.

Barton, talking to QPR boss Harry Redknapp on Saturday, couldn't prevent his side losing 1-0 at Newcastle

‘We’ve been very good at home recently. That’s got to be the priority for us - turning Loftus Road into a fortress and making it a difficult place for teams to come to.

‘Credit to the lads, we’ve done that all season. Anything away from home in the Premier League is a bonus.’ The R’s managed just four shots on target at Newcastle and Redknapp said his side lacked the pace to trouble the hosts, who were depleted in light of injuries to nine first-team players.

And Barton certainly feels their latest away loss was an opportunity missed.

‘The overriding feeling (after Saturday) was disappointment,’ he said. ‘We weren’t really at the races.

‘It was an understrength Newcastle side - one that has been in great form - but one we felt we could do a number on. 

‘We could have done with (three points) in our current predicament. We’ve had a number of great performances of late but we haven’t put as many points on the board as we’d like to. 

‘We’re extremely disappointed (with where we are) but there’s a long way to go.’ 

Holland international Leroy Fer, in action at Newcastle, is adamant their away form must improve quickly

Barton’s midfield comrade Leroy Fer, meanwhile, has not given up on their away form, but admits it needs to pick up if they’re to avoid relegation back to the Championship.

‘We will need to start getting something away from home if we are to stay up,’ said the Holland international. 

‘We know that's important and it's something we are keen address quickly. We have two home games coming up against sides around us (Leicester and Burnley) and we have to win them.’
