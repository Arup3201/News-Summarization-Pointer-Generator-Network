Josh Kelchner, a long-term foster child, has defied the odds to graduate from New York's prestigious West Point Military Academy as a lieutenant.

After a rough childhood that included four different high schools and 12 foster homes, the 22-year-old has finally come to a point in his journey where he can relax - briefly.

Currently on holiday in Puerto Rico, the graduate has a short break before he heads to Fort Sill, in Lawton, Oklahoma, for field artillery training and to begin his five years compulsory service.

Kelchner's childhood still haunts him.

A local newspaper article about the then 17-year-old in 2008 describes the trials of the younger Kelchner.

When Kelchner was just a toddler his father abandoned the family, leaving his mother to raise Kelchner, who would be joined by three younger siblings.

His mother did not cope with her responsibilities and neglected Kelchner, who can count 12 different foster homes over seven-and-a-half years.

'Whenever you get harshness you can’t think it’s your fault,' Kelchner told News-Press recently.

'You move past it. You don’t think it’s your fault.'

Kelchner tried to keep his siblings together as they were shuttled from one home to another. 

'I had one girl on one arm, the other girl on the other arm and my brother on my shoulders,' he told News-Press.

'I didn’t want us to be broke up. I felt like they were the only thing I really had that stayed constant,' he said.

'According to his brother and sisters, he’s the one who got them up for breakfast and took them to the bus stop,' said Gwendolyn Burdette, Kelchner’s caseworker for the Department of Children and Families, in 2008.

When Kelchner finally lost the battle to keep his siblings together in 2005, it was an opportunity for the teenager to settle into a new home and focus his future.

He moved in with the Burdick family and settled into school and was allowed to just be a kid.

He excelled at sports at Dunbar High School - his fourth - and was no slouch academically, either, making the honor roll.

Kelchner's siblings were all adopted out and according to News-Press, are doing well.

When Kelchner was 17, he attended a West Point seminar. Out of 400 other attendees, he left with an award for outstanding leadership.

After his experience at the seminar, Kelchner decided to apply to attend West Point Military Academy.

The academy receives more than 13,000 applications from students wanting to attend each year. It accepts just 1,100 of these.

Kelchner was accepted, and after a brief upset when he left the academy in shame after flunking out of an academic course, he graduated with flying colors.

Now, Kelchner feels he's found somewhere he feels at home and is planning a career in the military.

'I like the atmosphere and the camaraderie,' Kelchner told News-Press. 'Everybody helps everybody out.'

'I’m kinda thinking long-term. We’ll see how this feels,' he said.
