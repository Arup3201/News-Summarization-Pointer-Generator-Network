You wouldn't think you would find Australia's best bargain hunter 85 kilometres from the nearest shop.

Ian Burnett, 46, has made an art of online shopping, securing deals on everything from Nintendo WII's to state of the art DVD recorders, for hundreds less than sold in retail.

And he's happy to share his shopping tips.

The biggest drawback? You'll have to spend hours on bargain sites, like CatchOfTheDay waiting for the best deals to appear.

Ian Burnett from Jeparit Victoria has spent $28,000 over 8 years on CatchOfTheDay and has saved $10,000

The father of four admits he has sat on the site for 12 hours straight before and spends a few hours on it a day

'I've sat on the site for 12 straight hours before,' Ian told Daily Mail Australia.

'At 12 o'clock everyday, they release a new product... So you obviously have to be online for that.' 

Ian began using CatchOfTheDay in 2006 when they first started and were only releasing one product per day.

'They maybe had 1000 of the one product in stock and they'd just wait until it ran out,' he said.

'The first thing I bought was a Thompson DVD recorder and they were the awesome, expensive thing back then and I only paid $76.'

His insider shopping tips include checking the site everyday after 12 for brand new bargain and signing up to their Facebook page to get exclusive deals.

Ian's best bargain was a Nintendo WII that he purchased for his children, saving $300 off the retail price

'I also buy in bulk as they have a shipping cap,' he said.

'You can pick up 10 or 20 items and get them shipped for the same price as if you got one.'

Ian also said he has paid for a yearly subscription to CatchOfTheDay free shipping before for $75 and for an avid shopper like him, that saves a lot.

Comparing products to others sold at big retailers is also important according to Ian, as you can see how much is being saved.

And for a father of four who works in a supermarket, he is very much in the know. 

Ian's proudest purchase was a Nintendo WII for his four children after they insisted it was all they wanted.

He did not think he'd be able to fork out the $400 for one in retail so he used his skills to find one discounted to $99.

'I have also purchased a Tom Tom for $10 on a super bargain birthday sale,' he said.

Ian has spent $28,000 in his eight years of using CatchOfTheDay and believes he has saved over $10,000.

Ian's family have followed in his footsteps and are also crazy about finding online deals

'The postie bringing it all to your door is so much easier than travelling to a shopping centre and spending hours looking for an item'

Ian believes that even if he lived in a big city, he would still use online shopping due to its convenience

The 46-year-old father of four lives in Jeparit, 400 kilometres from Melbourne and the isolation means online shopping is Ian's only option.

He not only purchases appliances and other household items, but also uses CatchOfTheDay to purchase his groceries too.

'I think that if I lived in a big city, I would still use online shopping,' Ian said.

'The postie bringing it all to your door is so much easier than travelling to a shopping centre and spending hours looking for an item.'

Tragedy struck for the Burnett family last September when a spontaneous grass fire wiped out their Jeparit home, taking much of their online shopping haul with it.

'We tried to put it out, but our home was a 1985 federation style home made of old, dry wood so as soon as it hit, it went up in flames,' he said.

Although still rebuilding their home, Ian is optimistic, especially in relation to his shopping.

'It just means I get to buy all this crazy stuff again!'
