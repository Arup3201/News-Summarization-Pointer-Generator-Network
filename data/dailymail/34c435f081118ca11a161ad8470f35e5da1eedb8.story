One more casualty of the VA hospital system.

Edward Laird, a 76-year-old Navy veteran, was kept waiting at the Phoenix VA hospital for a biopsy to determine whether a blemish on his nose was cancerous.

Two and a half years later, the cancer had progressed so far that 70% of his nose needed to be removed, Laird told CNN.

Neglected: Edward Laird, 76, was repeatedly denied a biopsy at the dermatology clinic of the VA hospital and his nose was taken over by cancer

Laird first learned he might have a problem when his physician at the Phoenix VA hospital referred for a biopsy at the VA dermatology clinic.Â 

At the clinic, the biopsy was repeatedly delayed.

The cancer spread through much of the nose, requiring immediate surgery. The reconstructive surgery left Laird using a popsicle stick to prop open his left nostril.

The Phoenix VA where Laird went for treatment was at the center of a scandal in April after CNN connected the deaths of 40 veterans to hidden waiting lists.

Dr. Sam Foote, a former VA doctor, blew the whistle on the facility for keeping two waiting lists, one with the actual list of patients awaiting care, the other with patients ready to receive care in the next 14 days.

Foote says the dummy lists were sent to Washington to create the illusion that the hospital saw patients within an acceptable waiting time, which is normally considered 14 to 30 days.

An investigation of the delays by the Department of Veteran Affairs' Office of Inspector General blasted 'clinically significant delays' for dozens of veterans but did not conclude the delays led to any deaths.

Laird says he relies on VA care since his only other insurance option now is Medicare Part A, which does not cover outpatient care.

Laird says that in spite of the lines, he feels proud to go to the VA hospital if it means standing among fellow veterans.

'When you go, there you feel like you're walking along with a bunch of champions,' Laird said. 'It'll jerk a tear from you sometimes.'
