'I have asked already because now it's an open field but there is always wind.

'And
 wind is not always the friend of the players. It's not always the 
friend of the ball and so we have to do something about that. But the 
facilities are fantastic.'

The
 Carrington complex was structured according to legendary boss Sir Alex 
Ferguson's specifications, but Van Gaal has also ordered a new playing 
surface for his stars.

Van
 Gaal has ordered at least two pitches be replaced by Desso, the 
synthetic-grass hybrid material that has been in place at Old Trafford 
since 2013.
