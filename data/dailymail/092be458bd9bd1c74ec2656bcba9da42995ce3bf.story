This is the horrifying moment a masked woman held a foot-long  knife to a nine-year-old boy's throat during a botched corner shop robbery.

Schoolboy Manand Patel was threatened with the blade and ordered to open the till for the female robber's male accomplice at Nairne Convenience Store in Edinburgh.

She then brandished the weapon at his father and uncle - threatening to kill them if they tried to help the youngster, who is a pupil at Leith Walk Primary.

Manand screamed for his father and desperately tried to open the till for the male robber, but he could not reach.

Schoolboy Manand Patel was threatened with the blade and the mashed robber also brandished the weapon at his father Bharat, 44 (pictured together)

CCTV footage shows how the boy's father Bharat, 44, bravely ignored the warning and pushed past the woman before jumping on the counter to protect his son.

'We were not bothered about what happened to us, we just wanted to save him,' said Mr Patel.

'I wanted to save my son rather than save the money - he could have been killed.

'I didn't know if there were more people outside. They had a knife, so we didn't want to take a risk.'

He claims the woman threatened him and his brother, Rajan, by saying: 'Stay here or we'll kill you' and that the knife was 'as long as his forearm'.

They had been re-stocking the upper level of the shop, which  overlooks the till area, before the robbery took place at 8.45pm on Wednesday.

Manand was playing a game on a mobile phone before the two robbers walked into the shop dressed entirely in black with their faces covered.

He could be seen cowering behind the counter before his dad jumped up in front of him and confronted the robbers.

Police are now hunting two robbers - one male and one female - in their mid-20s and around 5ft tall

Rajan, 36, said: 'He was just screaming, 'Daddy, Daddy'. He couldn't reach the till. He was trying to avoid the knife and trying to open the till, but he couldn't. He's okay, but he couldn't sleep at night.' 

'I didn't know if there were more people outside. They had a knife, so we didn't want to take a risk,' said Bharat, who said the woman looked 'unfit'.  

The busy shop, which has been run by the Patels since 2009, was also targeted three years ago, when an employee was threatened and a laptop stolen. 

The family now plans to have two workers in the shop at all times for extra security.

Rajan said: 'We are very lucky that everybody was safe. We're not worried about money – no-one being injured is the main point.'

Detective Constable Jonny Wright said both suspects were described as being in their mid-20s and around 5ft tall.

He said: 'This was a seriously distressing incident for the people involved and I would urge anyone who saw the suspects or any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time of the robbery to contact us.' 

Gordon Henderson, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'Business crime should be taken every bit as seriously as home-based crimes. These people are serving their communities and providing a vital service. Other shopkeepers need to be reassured that something is being done.'

Mr Henderson added: 'The boy will be scarred; he'll remember this for the rest of his life.'
