The puppeteer and voice of Elmo has quit Sesame Street after a second underage sex claim has come to light.

Kevin Clash, 52, a stalwart on Sesame Street for 28 years, has been accused by two men of having sex with them while they were underage.

Last week Sheldon Stephens, 
23, accused Clash of having sex with him when he was a teenager, a charge Clash denied. A day later, Stephens recanted his charge after a $125,000 settlement had been struck with Clash's lawyers.

A second lawsuit against Clash was filed on Tuesday by Cecil 
Singleton, who claims he encountered Clash on a gay phone chat line in 1993 
when he was 15 and Clash was 32. The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $5million.

Scandal on Sesame Street: Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash, 52, has resigned amid growing accusations that he slept with underage boys

Cecil Singleton claims Clash groomed him before they had sex when he was under age. He is seeking $5m

In the lawsuit filed in New York 
City's federal court, Singleton alleges Clash groomed him by 'taking him
to nice dinners and giving him money.'

In
its statement Tuesday, Sesame Workshop said 'the controversy 
surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction that none of 
us want,' leading Clash to conclude 'that he can no longer be effective 
in his job.'

'This is a sad day for Sesame Street,' the company said.

In
a statement of his own, Clash said 'personal matters have diverted 
attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I 
cannot allow it to go on any longer. I am deeply sorry to be leaving and
am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately.'

Clash created the high-pitched 
voice and child-like persona for Elmo, a furry, red Muppet that became 
one of the most popular characters on the show and one of the company's 
most lucrative properties. Sesame Workshop produces Sesame Street in New
York.

Since the scandal broke, Clash had been on a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop which produces the
popular children's TV show on PBS.

Sesame Workshop has insisted the scandal does not mean the end of Elmo. 'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said.

Resignation: Clash has left the popular children's show but that doesn't mean it's the end of the road for Elmo

Sheldon Stephens has claimed he was pressured into accepting a $125,000 settlement to retract his initial allegations

The resignation follows reports that Stephens, 
23, wanted to undo the $125,000 settlement he had struck with Clash's lawyers after making his original underage sex allegation.

He has apparently met with 
lawyers in Los Angeles and told them he was pressured into recanting his
allegation and insists he is telling the truth about having sex 
with Clash when he was 16, reported TMZ.

Stephens, a struggling actor/model, told lawyers he was willing to forfeit the $125,000 settlement to restore his name. 

Under
the terms of the current settlement, if Stephens is asked by anyone about his 
relationship with Clash, he must repeat only the following statement: 
'He [Stephens] wants it to be known that his sexual relationship with 
Mr Clash was an adult consensual relationship.'

Accusations that Clash, who is openly
gay, engaged in an underage sexual affair set off a media firestorm 
after they were revealed last Monday.

Within 24 hours of the story 
breaking, Stephens recanted his claim.

After Stephens had withdrawn his allegations, Clash told the New York Times through a 
spokesman: 'I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to 
rest. I will not discuss it further.'

In addition to his marquee role as Elmo, Clash had served as the 
show's senior Muppet coordinator and Muppet captain. He won 23 daytime 
Emmy awards and one prime-time Emmy.

In 2006, he published an autobiography, My Life as a Furry Red 
Monster, and was the subject of the 2011 documentary Being Elmo: A 
Puppeteer's Journey.

Though it remained unclear who might take over for Clash performing 
as Elmo, other Sesame Street puppeteers have been trained to serve as 
his stand-in, Sesame Workshop said.

Clash
has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as 
well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine
Daytime Emmy Awards.

Clash exchanged messages with Stephens in 2010 in which he apologised for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true.'

The puppeteer told the man almost 30 years his junior 
that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New 
York.

Model: Sheldon Stephens, 23 of Pennsylvania, accused Elmo Muppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex with him when he was underage

The Sesame Street stalwart, who had worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual 
relationship with the accuser, but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult.

In emails sent well after the accuser turned 18, Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.'

He added: 'I want you to know that I love
you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure 
your dreams come true...

'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.'

Clash said the relationship was between two consenting adults and that he was deeply 
saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.'

The 
accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers.

In the spotlight: The Sesame Workshop called the controversy 'a distraction that none of us want'

In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a
letter to Sesame Street accusing the program of trying to 'discredit 
the victim in order to protect its 
employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.'

The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of
a young man.'

Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the allegation of underage sex was 
unsubstantiated after a thorough 
investigation.

They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received.

Sesame Street disciplined Clash 
for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to 
Stephens but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual 
relationship.

They said the divorced 
father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but originally 
claimed his leave of absence would allow him to defend his reputation in
the wake of the damaging allegations.
