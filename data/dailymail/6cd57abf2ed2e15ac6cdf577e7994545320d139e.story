Colorado resident Bill Feldman was worried sick when his beloved dog went missing, so when he got a call from his neighbor hours later telling him that his pet was at his house, he was relieved.

But then Mr Feldman learned that his pooch Henry has attacked a cat, and that his neighbor was not going to release him until all of the injured animal's veterinarian bills were paid in full, and then some.

After five hours of tense ransom negotiations, Feldman called police to report that Henry was being held hostage.

The rambunctious black-and-white pup took off from Feldman’s mansion located in the Denver suburb of Morrison last month.

After attacking a neighbor's cat, the pooch found himself shut in behind a gate up a hill.

Ironically, Feldman's pet, a rescue dog, was the inspiration behind his new invention: a wrist band that hooks up to a leash to keep pet owners' hands free during walks.

After scouring the surrounding area in search of his missing dog, Feldman got the call that Henry has been detained by the neighbor for injuring his pet cat.

‘I said I’m so sorry for your cat and i volunteered to absolutely take care of the vet bills and he said, “Well, that’s good because you’re not going to get your dog back until all those vet bills are paid for,”’ Feldman told the station KDVR.

The medical costs amounted to $325, but Feldman said his neighbor expected a bigger payout.

Feldman, a US Navy veteran and a Maine native, launched his burgeoning business, Liberty Wristbands, last July featuring Henry as the face of the brand selling hands-free leash holders at $29.99 each.

Desperate to get his beloved company mascot back, Feldman called police for help.

Responding officers were able to free the runaway pup and return him to his distraught owner.

‘Henry is my life,’ Feldman said. ‘I have no wife, no ex-wife, I have no kids.’

With the four-legged brand ambassador safely back home, Feldman has agreed to pay his neighbor's veterinary bills. The man's cat has since been released home.

The cat owner has not been charge in Henry's abduction because he released him to Feldman.
