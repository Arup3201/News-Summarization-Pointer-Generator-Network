There's little better in life than a big fat kiss from someone you love... right?

Well, you might not be so sure once you've seen this particularly intimate gif of two people playing tonsil hockey... that was shot from inside one party's mouth.

The video, originally loaded onto imgur and Reddit by user MrRobotoGotAGato and was spotted by Nerve, shows one mouth diving onto another, but thankfully stalls and repeats before things get any more heated.

Comments beneath the gif on Nerve ranged from 'could have found someone with cleaner teeth', to 'that's scarring' and even 'that's hot'.

But why are we so repulsed by the sight of something millions of people do every day? And why particularly when viewed from the lesser-seen angle of inside someone else's mouth?

Femail's resident sexpert Tracey Cox says it could be to do with the intimacy involved in kissing, but also the intrinsic dirtiness of mouths.

She said: 'There's a reason why lots of sex workers won't kiss - it seems more intimate than sex for many reasons not least of which because mouths harbour a lot of bacteria!

'The inside of our mouths and our tongues aren't the prettiest sight and one reason why we think "Ewww!" when the couple next to you on the tube start making out and you get a front row seat of the tongue action.'
