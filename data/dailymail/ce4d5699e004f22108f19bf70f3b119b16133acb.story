Federal law enforcement officials are investigating a former Marine and several active-duty Marines after they allegedly posted threatening and lewd remarks online against President Obama and California Rep. Jackie Speier.

The threats were made on one of many Facebook pages that have targeted Speier, a Democrat, since she alerted the Defense Department to an online forum where Marines were posting degrading images of female service members.

The page that prompted the investigation, titled 'F*** You Jackie Speier,' has since been removed by Facebook, but another - called 'Jackie struggle snuggle Speier' has gone up in its place with similar content, including a photograph of Speier that has been edited to look as though she has a black eye with the caption, 'She burned the bacon only once.'

Threats: Several Facebook pages, including this one, have been targeting Rep. Jackie Speier since the Democratic congresswoman alerted Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to inappropriate activity by Marines online

Speier told KCBS that she refereed the original page to authorities after users 'made threatening claims to both the president and me.'

Both the Secret Service and U.S. Capitol Police are involved in the investigation, according to USA Today.

Speier was targeted online after she wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel regarding the Facebook page 'F'N Wook,' on which several active duty and former Marines had posted sexually degrading comments and explicit pictures of female service members.

In one photo from that page, which has been removed, a female Marine is pictured putting a male Marine into a choke hold. The caption reads: 'This is my rape face.'

Another photo shows a female soldier lying on the ground with a gun and the caption reads: 'Hehe... I can "bang" even when I am not on my back!'

Several Marines have since been referred to their commanders for punishment as a result of that page and other inappropriate activity online.

Outrage: This is a copy of part of Rep. Jackie Speier's letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel concerning a Facebook page called 'F'N Wook'

In retaliation against Speier's letter to Hagel, several pages have popped up on Facebook targeting the congresswoman. The page that was referred to authorities for investigation was removed by Facebook over the weekend and its replacement went live on May 24. So far it has 44 'likes.'

'Welcome back my hateful friends,' Facebook user Chris LaCorte, who claims to be a former Marine, wrote on the page. 'What women's group do you think will declare a jihad on us first this time?'

Rep. Jackie Speier expressed outrage over the website in a letter sent to the Pentagon

The content includes pictures of Speier 
and former Defense Secretary Hillary Clinton with lewd captions and 
comments suggesting that women enjoy rape.

'If you get pregnant from a rape than
 it means you enjoyed it,' reads one remark, which was 'liked' by a user
 claiming to be a former Marine.

Another post reads: 'I raped pregnant woman once. Best threesome ever.'

The moderator of the page acknowledged the federal investigation in a comment posted to the page late Monday.

'None
 of the posts or pictures on this page should be suggested that we are 
threatening to harm another person, including Jackie Speier or Obama,' 
the moderator wrote. 'This page should be looked at as harsh humor and 
we will work with authorities on any questions they may ask.'

The
 message adds: 'This page is meant to distract Jackie and all liberals 
who hate freedom of speech. Other military pages were taken down for an 
agenda.'

Marine
 activity on Facebook has come under fire as the military faces 
increased scrutiny for increases in sexual assaults within the ranks.

As
 many as 26,000 military members have reported that they were sexually 
assaulted last year, which is up from 19,000 reported assaults in 2011.

Taken down: 'F'N Wook' was removed by Facebook after Speier sent the letter

Response: Following Speier's letter, the Marine Corps warned its members to 'avoid inappropriate behavior' online
