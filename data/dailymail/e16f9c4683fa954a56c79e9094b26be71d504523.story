Lifeguards will monitor Sydney's northern beaches in winter for the first time ever with warm weather forcing them to extend their patrol season to June.

The record warm weather in Sydney has seen people continue to flock to the beaches in above average numbers throughout Autumn, soaking up what they thought would be the last of the summer sunshine.

Clinton Rose from the Warringah Council told The Daily Telegraph that in an unprecedented event lifeguards will patrol Dee Why beach on the first weekend of winter.

'Our duty to protect the public is our first and only priority and the warm weather means more people are visiting our most popular beaches for longer,' he said.

'For the first time, we'll patrol our most popular beach Dee Why, in the first weekend of June. We're also planning to patrol Dee Why on weekends and public holidays in June pending weather conditions.'

In NSW, Bondi and Manly are the only beaches patrolled all year round, with lifeguards at other beaches usually finishing their seasons at the end of May.

Byron Bay in Northern NSW recently extended their patrols on the main beach, though according to the Australian Lifeguard Service (ALS) have no plans to permanently extend the season.

'With temperatures expected to drop significantly and rain periods to develop over the coming week, there will be no extension of services,' a spokesperson told the newspaper.

This is the Sydney's warmest May on record, and as of Tuesday the harbour city experienced its 18th day over 20C.

These temperatures are forecast to slowly cool down according to the Bureau of Meteorology, with some rain expected from Thursday and over the coming weekend.
