In a tragic off-season accident a 24-year-old woman working at the Alpine Meadows ski resort has died from injuries she suffered while skiing in the back-country near Lake Tahoe.

Annalise Kjolhede sustained injuries to her head and neck after a 'serious incident' on Saturday. She was taken to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, where she died on Tuesday. 

Thousands of tributes for the popular ski instructor were posted onto an online memorial page and the friends and family of the University of Rochester graduate held a commemoration service for her at the ski resort where she coached children.

Alpine Meadows doesn't officially open until December 7th but a spokesman for the resort Amelie Richmond said that because the ski-runs are mostly on U.S. Forest Service land they are open for public use.

'Alpine Meadows operates on forest service land,' Squaw Valley spokeswoman Amelie Richmond said. 

'With few exceptions, it is open for public use. Meaning that over these past few weeks skiers and riders have been allowed to access the land despite the fact that the ski resort was not open.'

The University of Rochester graduate was a member of Alpine Meadow's Kids Ski School and was taking advantage of the fact that skiers are able to treat the resorts runs as if they were hiking in a national park.

'You can go skiing almost anywhere on forest service land,' said Dan Morris.

'It’s just like backpacking or hiking. You have to know the conditions and use due diligence.'

The Unofficialalpine.com website updated their page with an update that said Kjolhede was skiing 'somewhere near Wolverine Bowl' when she suffered a 'traumatic brain injury' after hitting a 'submerged rock'.

In a tribute page set up on Caring Bridge for Annalise, her mother Anna recounted the sudden accident her daughter suffered on the Californian slopes while skiing with two friends.

'She took a run to the left, went over a bump, fell and her head slid into a submerged rock,' said the post written by the distraught mother.

'She struck the left side of her face and head (she was wearing a helmet). And she was motionless, head (sic) downhill and her body arched backward because her ski is (sic) were caught in the snow.

'This is also the position that potentially kinked her neck and altered her breathing.'

Kjolhede was airlifted from Alpine to Renown Health receiving CPR en-route.

The page was originally set up following Annalise's accident on Saturday, but tragically became a tribute page when she passed away on Tuesday.

'It helps me to know that Annalise was doing what she loved on a beautiful day at Alpine Meadows and she was happy,' wrote her mother Anna, who is a pediatrician.

One friend of the family wrote a touching message despairing at the Kjolhede family's loss.

'Our hearts are broken!  We pray that Annalise's beautiful spirit will guide you in the healing process, remembering her smile and the way she lived her life.'

Following the popular students death, the University of Rochester issued a message praising Annalise.

'She was an exceptional student and will be missed tremendously,' said the statement.

'Annalise was a wonderful part of our campus community, and our thoughts and sympathies go out to Annalise’s family and friends at this time.'

Following her death, her colleagues at Alpine Meadows held a commemoration service for Annalise and the resort lamented her passing.

'Her outgoing personality, passion for working with kids and friendly 
nature will be remembered and missed by all of her friends and 
colleagues here at Squaw and Alpine,' Alpine Meadows said in its 
statement.

'Her passing is a tragic loss for our team and community.'
