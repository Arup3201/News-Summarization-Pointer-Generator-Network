High-maintenance trophy wives, physical attractiveness and TOWIE-type party girls are these days being shunned by British men in favour of women personality, wit, brains and sophistication, according to new research.

And it seems both the Duchess of Cambridge and the economic downturn are to thank for this shift.

Funny girl: British men look for wit, thoughtfulness and brains in women these days, as opposed to more superficial and high-maintenance traits

Thanks
to the former Kate Middleton's elegance, classic style and intelligence, British men 
have now decided they are most attracted to smart, dark-haired women 
with sophisticated dress sense and a sense of humour.

Psychologists also believe that poor economic conditions have led to people becoming less materialistic, seeking partners who can provide happiness and security rather than manicured nails and good cleavage.

Nowadays men are least attracted to the 
energetic, party-girl types seen on TV programmes such as The Only Way 
Is Essex.

In fact, 72 per cent of men say they look for a good personality rather than good looks in women, and rather than high-maintenance TOWIE types, most British men would prefer a Kate Middleton type: smart, five six with dark brown hair and just a touch of bronze to the skin.

The research also found half of men say they are most attracted to brainy girls with a funny spark and a classic dress sense.

Interestingly, the same held true for 
the girls, with exactly 50 per cent saying a brainy chap was most 
attractive. Eighty-two per cent of women rank a man's personality as more important than his 
looks.

Girl types: Most British men look for a type of woman like the Duchess of Cambridge, left, while only 20 per cent said they are attracted to party girls such as Chloe Simms from The Only Way Is Essex, right

Thirty-one per cent of men said the 
ideal woman would be interested in music, 32 per cent would like a woman interested in travel, while 28 per cent are attracted to women 
keen on movies.

Only 14 per cent of men found sporty 
girls most attractive - though London men are getting into the
Olympic spirit, with 18 per cent 
preferring a sporty girl to any other type.

Only one in 20 men said they are attracted to party animals with 
energetic personalities, making it the least attractive ‘type’ of girl.

In addition, the most popular 
character traits in women are funny, sensitive, thoughtful and outgoing.

1. Funny

2. Thoughtful

3. Sociable

4. Confident

5. Romantic

2. Flirtatious

Psychologist
Dr David Lewis said: 'The findings suggest that male and female roles 
are evolving as what men look for in a woman are becoming more in line 
with what women typically look for in a man.

'Although we are 
initially attracted to someone through physical features, it’s now more 
important to people that their partners are companions rather than 
‘trophies’.

'The recent economic downturn could also play a part
in this evolvement, as we’ve become less materialistic as a nation than
before the recession, and now seek partners who can provide us with 
contentment and security'

Kavi Tolani, 
brand manager at Lynx, the company which conducted the research, said: 'We’ve always known guys have preferences for different 
personality types and it’s great to see this in our results.

'It’s
clear that different cultures and upbringings across the UK can make 
the mating game very competitive within regions, putting pressure on 
guys to succeed when they meet girls exhibiting a desired personality 
type.'
