Arsene Wenger has backed Jack Wilshere to take the World Cup by storm after revealing the Arsenal star’s rehabilitation from a broken foot will ensure he is in peak condition for England this summer.

The 22-year-old has not played since suffering a hairline fracture to his left foot during England’s friendly against Denmark on March 5 — an injury that appeared to threaten his participation in Brazil.

But Wenger says the midfielder is likely to return for Arsenal’s clash with West Bromwich on May 5 and that he has already assured England manager Roy Hodgson he should have no worries about naming the playmaker in his squad.

On the mend: Jack Wilshere will go to the World Cup in peak condition, according to Arsene Wenger

Ouchy! The Arsenal playmaker has not played since breaking his foot in an international friendly against Denmark

‘Jack started to jog again this week and I would say two to three weeks until he returns to action,’ said Wenger. ‘I spoke with Roy Hodgson, I told him Wilshere will be available for England. He will be just polished for England.

‘I think he will pick him. I didn’t feel any doubt on that front. Jack can prove himself to be  world class at the World Cup. He can be the positive surprise.

‘England has a very difficult group but if you come out of a group like that your belief is really strong. They have to deal really well with the situation as they have Italy and Uruguay in the group and they have to get out of there.’

Wenger also believes Wilshere is ready to put his long run of injuries behind him and show his consistency next season.

A long-term ankle problem meant he did not make a single appearance during the 2011-12 season and just 35 for club and country the following campaign.

Yet Wenger says Wilshere has learned a lot during his lay-offs and is adamant he will prove his doubters wrong when he gets a run of games.

Stuttered: Wilshere has had a stop-start season after a succession of niggling injuries

‘He has been stop-start this year and last season,’ he said. ‘I think we have sorted out the problem and I hope from now on he will be always available.

‘I hope he has stabilised now. We have seen with Lionel Messi recently, who is the best player in the world, that being in and out is the most difficult thing to deal with as you need to be competitive and to do that you need to be playing.

‘He is a football man, Jack. You speak to him about something in the game and he understands straight away. He has a natural football understanding.

Not much in it: Wenger insists that Arsenal have not fallen behind Liverpool, despite the league table

‘He watches the game and analyses very well what happens. While they are injured, these players learn, of course. I think he learns from watching the games, from the problems you can face in the game.’

And Wenger has refuted suggestions Arsenal have fallen behind Liverpool this season, saying that the Reds’ lack of European football has helped them while his side have only struggled due to injuries.

‘We beat them twice this season and they also benefited from a season when they played only the Premier League. I do not think if you take the injuries, plus all the competitions we played in and compared it to Liverpool you cannot say we are miles behind them.’
