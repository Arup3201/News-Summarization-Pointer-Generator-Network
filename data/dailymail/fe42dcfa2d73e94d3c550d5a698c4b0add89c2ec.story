 A 17-year-old North Andover High School senior from Massachusetts drove to a party to pick
up her friend who was too drunk to drive.

Little did Erin Cox know that her decision to be a sober driver
for her drunken friend would cost her title as volleyball team captain. The
teen was also suspended for five games.

Fox reports that authorities busted the underage drinking
party on Main Street in Boxford, Ma and warned
the 15 North Andover High School students that they would be called to court
for drinking.

Honorable student: Erin Cox, a 17-year-old honor student, lost her title as captain of the volleyball team when she agreed to drive her drunk friend home from a party

North Andover High School in Massachusetts where a zero alcohol tolerance policy also refers to sober drivers

Erin Cox was one of those unlucky students , but she wasn't drinking. An officer vouched for her sobriety but that
didn’t change the school’s decision to punish the girl for her friend’s behaviour.

Erin’s mother, Eleanor Cox, filed a lawsuit in the district court last
week but the court told her that the school suspension was not under their
jurisdiction.

The family’s lawyer Wendy Murphy told CBS, ‘If a kid asks
for help from a friend, you don’t want that kid to say “I’m sorry I can’t help
you. I might end up in trouble at school.”’

Erin's mother, Eleanor cox, believes that her daughter did the right thing and that she shouldn't lose her position as team captain

MADD reports that drunk driving is extremely dangerous and amounts for one third of car accidents

The school’s website has a section in which it describes its
‘social learning expectations.’ It states, ‘North Andover students will
demonstrate service. They believe the growth and improvement of a relationship
and community depends on the willingness of others to contribute support to the
greater good.’

Drunk driving is extremely dangerous and amounts for one
third of car accidents, MADD reports. In recent years, 31 per cent of drunken car accidents were caused by teen drivers.

Erin Cox’s attempt to protect her friend
from an accident could qualify under ‘the willingness of others to contribute
to the greater good.’

When asked if she would drive her friend home safely after
becoming aware of the consequences, she said that she would.

'She didn’t do anything wrong. She did what she thought was
right, and I’m very proud of her,' Erin’s mother said.

CBS reported that the parents of Erin's teammates are forming a petition to support her.

The school’s lawyer Geoffrey Bok contends that the school is
trying to follow through with its zero tolerance drug and alcohol policy.

School officials were unavailable to comment on their opinion about drunk driving prevention.
