Brendan Tevelin, 19, was brutally killed by a man who wanted revenge for American actions in the Mideast

It has been three months since  college student Brendan Tevlin was brutally murdered in New Jersey by an extremist determined to get revenge for American military action in the Middle East.

And every day since, his parents Michael and Allison have passed by the corner of Walker Road and Northfield Avenue in West Orange — the spot where their 19-year-old son lost his life.

'We have to pass it every day,' Allison Tevlin told The Star-Ledger. 'We saw all the flowers and the crosses. It was unnerving.'

The parents pass the tragic corner on their way to Seton Hall Preparatory School, where Brendan was a lacrosse star and maintained a perfect 4.0 GPA for four years. They're hoping to raise funds for an athletic complex to be built and named after Brendan.

It is the same field that backs the woods where killer Ali Muhammad Brown, 29, hid for weeks after the murder — and the apartment complex where Brendan's body was eventually found. 

'The field is in the center of everything,' dad Michael Tevlin told The Star-Ledger. 'So much bad happened right there, we want the field to be something good.

'To us, it’s a symbol that good is going to overcome evil. We took something terrible and made something good out of it.'

In an interview, the family tells The Star-Ledger they're focusing on honoring Brendan's life and coming to terms with his death.

'We still have three beautiful kids to raise,' Michael Tevlin told The Star-Ledger. 'We’re committed to Brendan’s memory but we still have to raise our other children and continue to instill in them the values we instilled in Brendan.' 

'We’re trying to focus on our kids moving forward,” Allison added to the newspaper. 'We don't want them to be sad all the time.' 

Brendan had finished his freshman year at the University of Richmond, where he was planning to major in business, the school said. He graduated last year from Seton Hall Preparatory School.

His room still looks the exact same way he left it: pictures with his lacrosse teammates,a photo from the day he went surfboarding on the Jersey Shore, and the gold tassel that shows his perfect score throughout high school, the Star-Ledger reported.

There are also rocks from the Catholic retreats Brendan liked to attend, a reminder to his parents of their son's values and the importance of remaining strong for their family.

'To have someone so good taken so young from you could really rock the foundation of your faith — but if we let that happen, I know he would be so disappointed in us,' Allison told The Star-Ledger.

'Knowing how strong his faith was has given us some light and kept us grounded.'

The New Jersey teenager was on his way home from a friend's house on June 25 when Brown and two accomplices approached his car at a West Orange intersection and allegedly shot the promising young student multiple times. 

Records show that Brown has confessed that he killed four men — including Brendan — because 'all these lives are taken every single day by America, by this government. So a life for a life.'

Brown told investigators that he considered it his mission to kill Brendan as an act of 'vengeance,' records show. He describes the murder as a 'just kill' — and as part of his beliefs, if a 'man sees evil then he must take action against that evil.'

Prosecutors say that Brown views US military intervention in the Middle East as that 'evil' against which he must act.

Brown faces four counts of aggravated murder in the first degree. He also faces three more murder charges for those he allegedly carried out across the summer in Seattle.

Court documents seen by MailOnline show that the authorities were aware of Brown's fundamentalism more than a decade ago.

He was arrested in 2004 as one of 14 men swooped on by federal agents following an investigation into a fraud ring suspected of defrauding banks across the country with the aim of funding terrorist groups in Somalia.

Investigators could not prove that any money was moved overseas and Brown was charged along with three others, including his two half-brothers Karim Abdhullah Assalaam and Attawwaab Muhammad Fard, on multiple counts of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
