Dressed in blue jumpsuits and crammed in to a courtroom dock, they were once the trusted henchmen of Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi.

A group of 30 of the deposed leader's senior officials packed into a courtroom cage in the country's capital, Tripoli, to face charges ranging from corruption to war crimes.

But although the ruler's fearsome ex-spy Abdullah al-Senussi was in attendance, there was no sign of Gaddafi's sons Saadi Gaddafi and Saif Islam who are also on trial.

The court case, at Tripoli's Al-Habda prison, is seen as a crucial test for the North African states transition to democracy.

Many of the charges relate to deaths during the the 2011 uprising, which expanded into a civil war that eventually ousted Gaddafi.

The former Libyan leader was later killed after being captured by rebels.

The trial began a day after interim 
prime minister Abdullah al-Thinni announced his resignation after an 
attack on his family and following the ousting of the previous prime 
minister barely a month ago.

The
 International Criminal Court and other human rights organisations are 
concerned over the fairness of Libya's justice system although the 
government won the right last year to try Gaddafi's former spy chief 
domestically instead of at the ICC.

The 37 defendants face charges varying from murder, kidnapping, and embezzlement of public funds as well as abuses during the 2011 uprising that led to the ousting and killing of Gaddafi

Senussi
 was joined in the court by Gaddafi's former prime minister Baghdadi 
al-Mahmoudi, and former foreign minister Abdul Ati al-Obeidi. Also in 
the court was ex-intelligence chief Buzeid Dorda, who had appeared at 
earlier trial proceedings.

But
 the chief investigator in the case, Sidiq al-Sour, said Saadi would not
 appear in court on Monday because investigations were still ongoing.

Known as a playboy 
with a brief career in professional football, Saadi was extradited to Libya 
from Niger in early March. He had been expected to appear in court for 
the first time to hear charges.

Saif
 al-Islam, long viewed as Gaddafi's heir and still held by a group of 
former rebels in western Libya, had been expected to appear by

After
 Monday's opening session, the trial will not resume until April 27 as 
investigators need more time to finish their cases with some of the 
defendants.

Addressing the four judges, many of the defendants complained they had not been given access to lawyers or only saw them at court appearances.

'I want to be treated like other prisoners. I want visiting rights. I don't have a lawyer,' Senussi said.

Prosecutors said Senussi had been allowed to see relatives, but denied lawyers had been prevented from visiting their clients at the prison.

Post-Gaddafi Libya has so far been defined by a weak interim government and growing unrest as former revolutionary fighters refuse to give up their weapons, and armed protesters blockade the country's crucial oil exports.

But
 Libya's justice minister insisted that the trial was open to the public
 who would ensure the process was fair and not turn into a 'Mickey 
Mouse' show trial.

'I
 will not allow any crazy stuff, I will make sure it meets international
 standards ... that is why we are having open trials,' Salah 
al-Merghani, the justice minister told Reuters.
