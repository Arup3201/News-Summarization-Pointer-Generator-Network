A passer-by saved the life of a three-month-old baby on Monday when he crawled into a car that was upside-down in water, used a knife to cut the straps off the car seat and pulled her out.

The accident happened on Monday when Stephen McGouldrick, 55, lost control of his SUV on an icy road and skidded down an embankment into almost three feet of water.

Police said passer-by Leo Moody, of Kingman, crawled into the SUV and freed the baby girl in Kossouth Township, Maine. 

The SUV was submerged in three feet of water after the driver slid off the road in Kossouth Township, Maine. A baby in a carseat was pulled free by a Good Samaritan

The infant was submerged for a short time and was not breathing and unresponsive when pulled free. 

Another passer-by, Wade Shorey, a married father who had recently learned CPR on a course, resuscitated the child. She was taken to Eastern Maine Medical Center for observation.

State Police Trooper Chad Lindsey told Bangor Daily News that the vehicle went off an embankment airborne and landed on its roof in a stream.

Mr McGouldrick and two other passengers, Brenda Haney, 53, of Calais, and the child's mother, Beverly Metcalf, 34, of Talmadge, suffered minor injuries and were treated and released from hospital.

Mr McGouldrick's sister commented on social media: 'so glad my brother Stevie and everyone else is ok...someone was deff watching over them....'

Mr Shorey later commented on his heroic actions on social media. He said: 'A special thanks to all the other [sic] that helped in any fashion, especially John for being a brave man to be in ice cold water pulling the baby out and Marie for a warm truck.'
