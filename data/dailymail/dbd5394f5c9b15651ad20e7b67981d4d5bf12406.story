Beef has been wiped off  restaurant menus across Mumbai after its state government said it will now enforce laws making possession of the meat and the slaughter of cows illegal.

But steak and kidney pie will continue to be served up at one of India's oldest British Raj-era clubs in defiance of the ban.

The law was passed by the state of Maharashtra around 20 years ago, but not implemented until now by a new Hindu nationalist administration.

Violators could face a fine and up to five years in prison.

Residents expressed outrage on Twitter using the hashtag #BanBeef - which topped the social network's trends, appearing more than 22,000 times in less than 24 hours.

But panicked steak lovers will have a safe haven at the Royal Bombay Yacht Club, Mumbai, which will continue to serve its steak and kidney pies to customers.

The 170-year-old club has said it will keep steak on the menu by sticking to its original recipes using 'buff' - buffalo meat - rather than beef for the pies.

Club president Ardhendu Bose felt pessimistic about the ban until he realised that the leaner buffalo meat used in their recipes would leave the club's menu intact, he told the Daily Telegraph.

On Wednesday night, the club served both steak and kidney and steak and onion pies, with parsley potatoes and sautéed cauliflower to reassured customers.

'I spoke to my vice president and said "we should do something, we don't want to get into trouble". 

'But he said buffalo is allowed, so we'll carry on as usual', he said.

The 112-year-old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel removed beef from the menus on Wednesday, according to chief sommelier Abhas Saxena - including its 'really sought-after' Chateaubriand steak.

Mr Saxena said: 'Beef has been on the hotel's menu for many years.

'Our signature restaurants were affected by the ban so we will have to look again at the dynamics of their menus.

'Our Chateaubriand, the tornado - a cut of meat - the tenderloin, the veal, all of that has been removed. It will definitely affect our business.'

He added: 'We still need to understand the thought process behind the ban. 

'There are many segments of society being affected by this - from the folks who grow the cattle, to us who would be selling it.'

Hindus, who make up 80 per cent of India's 1.2billion population, consider cows sacred.

But large numbers of the population - particularly the extremes of the international elite and the poor - eat beef.
