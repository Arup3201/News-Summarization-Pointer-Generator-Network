Nigel Pearson has been caught on camera appearing to swear at a journalist after taking issue with a line of questioning.

The Leicester City manager was picked up on microphone seeming to call the reporter a ‘p****’ under his breath as his press conference following the 0-0 draw with Hull City ended.

Pearson was annoyed about a question over Steve Bruce’s claim Leicester’s players crowded referee Jon Moss in an attempt to get Alex Bruce sent off for a tackle on Riyad Mahrez.

He was then further angered by the suggestion his team’s season was ‘waxing or waning’ with ten games left and seven points separating Leicester from safety.

‘Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***,’ Pearson is heard saying as he finishes his press conference at the King Power Stadium. As he gets up he appears to utter the word: ‘P****.’

Pearson was irked at his players being accused of intimidating the officials given his stance on such matters.

Pearson does not countenance such dark arts. In a December interview he said: 'People who are more cynical-minded might say I’m naive.

'There is a concern at the Premier League about the number of times that is happening. I hope my players don’t start doing it.

'There’s a difference between being streetwise and using intimidation of officials as a vehicle to win. I’d never cheat to win.'

He is fiercely protective of his squad and, in any case, replays showed only a couple put their arms up in appeal with the same number of Hull players arguing the opposite.

It is a third controversial incident for Pearson this season. In December he was banned from the dugout for one game and fined £10,000 for telling a supporter to ‘f*** off and die’ after receiving sustained abuse.

In February he was involved in a touchline exchange with James McArthur as the pair fell together. Pearson jokingly throtted the Crystal Palace midfielder then held onto his shirt as he attempted to rejoin play.

The next day brought Pearson’s phantom sacking, when Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha is believed to have wanted to bring the axe before his son Aiyawatt counselled against. 

Bruce’s comments ultimately triggered the exchange on Saturday evening. The Hull manager said: ‘There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I’ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge.

‘For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make. The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it’s not right.’

Pearson was asked if he thought it was a fair criticism. ‘No,’ he said, before entering into a tetchy exchange with the journalist which ended with him finishing the press conference in angry fashion, and swearing under his breath. 

Steve Bruce cited Chelsea in terms of the Leicester players behaved to try and get Alex Bruce sent off…

Did they? Oh very nice.

Do you think that’s a fair criticism?

No.

What’s your take on that situation?

I’ve just said no.

But what’s your take on a situation where all the players surround a referee?

How many times have you seen us play this year?

Three times.

Well there you are then. You’re not in a position to judge my players on that.

I’m not judging anyone. I’m just asking you…

You’ve asked me and I’ve told you. No was the answer. I don’t think it’s a fair assessment. Full stop.

Do you consider that Leicester’s season is waxing or waning?

I don’t have to use that sort of analogy. We are in the same position. We’ve got ten games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved for us to give ourselves the best chance. That’s it. You got any more questions you want to ask? Obviously not. Yep good thank you. Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***. P****.
