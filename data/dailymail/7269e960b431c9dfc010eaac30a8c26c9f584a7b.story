Connor Chambers, now aged 18, of Oxley, Wolverhampton, was handed an 18-month detention and training order after he was found guilty of possession of a knife after a street brawl

Three teenage thugs whose terrifying gang battle with knives and a hammer was caught on camera have been jailed.

An imitation gun was fired and a teenage girl was battered to the ground as children watched on in horror while the group of 20 thugs 'bristling with weapons' brawled in the streets of Wolverhampton in April  last year.

Footage taken on a mobile phone captured the horrifying scenes as they unfolded outside the Britannia Hotel before the violence spilled into the hotel foyer. 

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the battle took place between the Firetown and the 623 gangs who joined forces to confront another unnamed rival group.

An imitation firearm was fired in the air by a 16-year-old who then pointed the weapon at another of the girls while Connor Chambers, 17, was seen waving a knife at a rival.

The boy with the hammer was chased by Nathaniel Nugent, 19, - who wore the distinctive red flash of the Firetown gang - along with fellow gang member Shamar Fairclough, 19.

The schoolboy fled into the foyer of the Britannia Hotel where he was involved in a scuffle and was later found to have suffered a stab wound to the chest that required five stitches.

Three teenagers were jailed and two handed a community order after the brawl in front of shocked shoppers.

Fairclough, 19, of Shifnal, Shrops., agreed to be bound over for 12 months at a previous hearing.

The boy with the gun, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given an 18-month detention and training order.

The 15-year-old boy with the hammer admitted possession of an offensive weapon, assault and affray and received an 18-month youth rehabilitation order under supervision and an eight-month night time curfew.  

The 70-second clip filmed by a witness showed two youths launching their attack and battering two young women as they cowered on the ground at 8pm.

Judge Andrew Lockhart, QC, told them: 'You came for a meeting between two groups which, if not actively planned, was enthusiastically anticipated.

'Those involved were bristling with weapons.

'There were at least two knives, a hammer and an imitation firearm and there are likely to have been more.

'The groups were out on the streets of this city armed to the teeth and looking for trouble.

'Weapons were wielded and used to inflict injury and terrify.'
