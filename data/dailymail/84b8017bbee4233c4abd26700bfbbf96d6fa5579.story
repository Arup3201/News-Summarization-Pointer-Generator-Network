Italy's prime minister has warned Europe's political elite to ramp up the fight against right-wing fringe parties such as UKIP or face 'the most Euro-sceptic, anti-European EU parliament in history'.

Enrico Letta said the growing popularity of Britain's UK Independence Party, France's National Front (FN) - as well as Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) - was the 'most dangerous phenomenon' facing the EU and could scupper hopes of an economic recovery.

He said if they manage to harness 25 per cent of the vote in parliamentary elections next May a 'very negative' effect could befall Brussels.

Stark warning: Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, left, speaks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Brussels last week. He warned that the growth of Britain's UK Independence Party, France's National Front (FN) and Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) was the 'most dangerous phenomenon' facing the EU

'I believe the risk of having the most anti-European European parliament in history is being greatly underestimated,' Letta told the Guardian and five other European newspapers.

Describing the challenge as a 'great battle' between 'the Europe of the people and the Europe of populism', he added: 'If we want to move from the legislature of austerity to a 
legislature of growth, and we find ourselves with the most Eurosceptic, 
most anti-European parliament in history, this goal will be immediately 
crippled, halted.'

Speaking to a handful of European newspapers this morning, he said he wanted to 'sound the alarm' before voters in all 28 member states go to the polls between
May 22 and 25 to elect a new European parliament. It will sit until 2019.

Nigel Farage's UKIP, Marine Le Pen's FN and a number of other similar parties from Poland, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria have enjoyed rapid surges in the polls with their tough stances on immigration and anti-EU policies appealing to disillusioned voters.

He said he and other Euopean leaders would be monitoring Britain carefully to see how well UKIP perform in the build up to the elections.

'A success of Nigel Farage's party would have very negative effects on the debate about Britain's exit from the EU,' he said. 'If one of the messages to come out of May's elections were that this party had placed first, it would certainly be seen as a step towards Britain's exit.'

'On this issue [Britain's exit],' he added, 'there is a bit of superficiality in Europe… This time, I believe, it could really happen.'

Letta, who has spoken of his desire for a 'United States of Europe', went on: 'European citizens have to feel they are being represented by Europe and at the moment there is clearly a problem.

'This, I believe, is the winning issue for [M5S's Beppe] Grillo, for Farage, for Marine Le Pen, for all European populism – that, to the question 'Who represents Europe? Who represents us in it?' the response, unfortunately, is stuttering.'

He also urged mainstream politicians to take extra care in their handling of the increasingly sensitive immigration debate or risk losing elections.
