While many brides fall victim to the cliche that they must have the most expensive and outlandish gown, one woman was determined not to stick with tradition.

Snubbing a big white frilly dress, Kelly Scott decided to go with something a little more modern - she wore a onesie.

She and new husband Stuart decided to shun the traditional big white dress and morning suit when they married at Gretna Green.

And the bride wore... a onesie! The newlyweds decided to make their special day more personal by marrying in their favourite fleece outfits

The couple, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, believe they may be the only couple to have ever wed in onesies - the fleecy all-in-one loved by celebrities and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg.

Kelly, a 30-year-old account manager for an energy company, said: 'Our favourite time of the day is when we are snuggled up watching TV in our onesies after the kids have gone to bed.

'Nowadays getting married costs thousands and we couldn't afford a traditional wedding.

'We felt sad about the thought of having a cheap wedding so we said "why not have a me and you wedding instead"?'

Keeping the chill out! The wedding party all sported the rompers to celebrate the couple's nuptials in Gretna Green

The bride cut down costs by wearing comfy slipper boots with her onesie and the groom wore trainers.

Ten members of the wedding party also wore the babygrow-style suits for the ceremony, including their one-year-old son Frankie and Kelly's seven-year-daughter Tiegan, their witnesses Helen Bottomley and Adam Mills, Kelly's aunt and uncle Karen and Andy Tweedale, her nephews Louis and Harrison Tweedale and niece Chloe Ellison.

Others chose to dress more traditionally, including the bride's younger brother Brad-Lee Mullins who wore a smart grey suit.

Wearing one has been likened to 'being inside a teddy bear's womb' and, despite its unflattering look, the onesie has become a global phenomenon.

Pre-Christmas sales were up 600 per cent, they were profiled on BBC 2's Newsnight - and even London Mayor Boris Johnson has confessed to owning one in a Union Jack pattern.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has admitted to owning a green onesie, the adult babygro beloved of Justin Bieber, Brad Pitt, Cheryl Cole, One Direction’s Harry Styles, Rihanna and Tom Daley.

The popularity of adult romper suits, known as ‘onesies’, helped drive a 25 per cent increase in total sales at Primark over the 16 weeks to 5 January.

The bride was given away by her step-dad Wayne Mullins and her father Roy Ellison was best man - but they decided to wear smart suits too.

Kelly and Stuart, a 39-year-old electrical engineer, had the last laugh in their snowboarding onesies when it started to snow.

Kelly added: 'We tried to get the minister to wear a onesie but he politely declined and told us he didn't have one.

He told us he had never married a couple in onesies before.'

She added: 'At first we said in a couple of years we would renew our vows but now I wouldn't change anything about our wedding day.

Everyone had big smiles on their faces.

'I did imagine getting married in a big white dress as a kid but as you get older you realise that there are things more important than

spending thousands on a dress.

'And the best thing is that we can snuggle up on the sofa in our wedding outfits.'

The couple, from Oakland Terrace, Castleton, are now saving up to go on honeymoon with their children to Disneyland and Las Vegas next year.

Stuart said: 'Our wedding day was so much fun. At first our friends and family thought we were mad but wearing onesies is the only time we get o be relaxed.

'It was perfect and we wouldn't change a thing.'
