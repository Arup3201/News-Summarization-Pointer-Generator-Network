A mother has been remanded in custody today after being charged with the murder of her eight-year-old daughter.

Polly Chowdhury, 34, appeared for a short hearing this morning at Barkingside Magistrates' Court in connection with the murder of Ayesha Ali.

Ayesha's body was found at her home in Chadwell Heath, east London, shortly after 11.30am on Thursday.

Investigation: A policeman stands outside the flat in Bedwell Court, East London where an eight-year-old girl died yesterday

Police had been called to the flat in Bedwell Court, Broomfield Road by paramedics, who had been attending an incident there.

Ayesha was declared dead at the scene.

Chowdhury was taken to a hospital in Romford for 
treatment to minor injuries. She was arrested by police on 
suspicion of murder after being discharged.

She will appear before a judge at the Old Bailey on Tuesday, court officials said.

Custody: A 34-year-old woman has been arrested after the death of the child

The results of a postmortem examination of her daughter, being carried out by Great Ormond Street Hospital, have yet to be announced.

The death is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police's homicide and major crime command (HMCC), Scotland Yard said.

Tributes have been left at the flat, including a bunch of carnations and roses by a local resident.

A card reads: 'In memory of a little girl whom I would never have met. From a neighbour, rest in peace. Amen.'

Sympathy: A neighbour has left a floral tribute after the tragic discovery of the dead girl

Emergency: Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service at around 11.38am on Thursday

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
