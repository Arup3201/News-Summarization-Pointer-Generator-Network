Though Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) is a fan of rap metal band Rage Against the Machine, the group is not returning the love – as Ryan joins the long list of politicians taking a bashing from the music world.

Mitt Romney’s VP pick revealed to The New York Times that the quartet is a top choice on his playlist, despite the band’s blatant support of leftist causes.  

Now the group’s guitarist, Tom Morello, is saying the conservative Midwesterner is ‘the embodiment of the Machine our music rages against.'

The California-based crew, which 
formed in 1991, consists of vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and 
backing vocalist Tim Commerford, Morello and drummer Brad Wilk. Their 
biggest hits include the singles: Killing in the Name, Calm Like a Bomb 
and Sleep Now in the Fire.

‘Paul Ryan is clueless about his 
favorite band, Rage Against the Machine. Ryan claims that he likes 
Rage's sound, but not the lyrics. Well, I don't care for Paul Ryan's 
sound or his lyrics,’ Morello, 48, writes this week in a piece for 
Rolling Stone about their noteworthy follower.

The 
group has vocally opposed the war in Iraq, government coddling of large 
corporations and has been extremely critical of the GOP platform.

The controversial group joins 'Led Zeppelin, Grateful Dead, Metallica, Beethoven, Hank Williams, Jr., and more' to make up Ryan's top music picks, according to his Facebook page.

‘He can like whatever bands he wants, 
but his guiding vision of shifting revenue more radically to the one per
cent is antithetical to the message of Rage,’ the Grammy Award-winning 
guitarist continued.

‘Don't mistake me, I clearly see that 
Ryan has a whole lotta ‘rage’ in him: A rage against women, a rage 
against immigrants, a rage against workers, a rage against gays, a rage 
against the poor, a rage against the environment. Basically the only 
thing he's not raging against is the privileged elite he's grovelling in
front of for campaign contributions,’ he added.

‘Many activists around the world, 
including organizers of the global occupy movement, were radicalized by 
Rage Against the Machine and work tirelessly for a more humane and just 
planet. Perhaps Paul Ryan was moshing when he should have been 
listening.’

Rage's sound, but not the lyrics. Well, I don't care for Paul Ryan's 
sound or his lyrics'

The outrage from Morello, on behalf of
RATM, comes after multiple artists have barred candidates, particularly
those of the conservative persuasion, from using their tunes at 
campaign events.

Romney likewise has faced push back from artists who are displeased at being featured in the candidate's musical repertoire, saying the use of their songs implies an endorsement.

Switch off: Silversun Pickups (backstage at a Canadian rock fest on July 14) don't want Mitt Romney using their song Panic Switch

The former Massachusetts Governor used Panic Switch, a song by the alternative rock band Silversun Pickups, but the 
group sent his campaign a cease-and-desist letter telling him to press 
stop.

In the Republican presidential 
primary, Tea Party darling, Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) would walk 
onto stage at campaign gatherings with Tom Petty’s American Girl playing
in the background.

That is until Petty’s lawyer sent her a cease and 
desist order and she was forced to find a new trademark ditty. 

Not my girl: Singer Tom Petty told Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) to stop using his song, American Girl, at her campaign events when she was a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination

Also in the primary, former Speaker 
Newt Gingrich was sued by a co-songwriter of the 
pep tune, Eye of the Tiger, for playing the song at his campaign 
rallies. 

GOP candidates have resorted to 
relying on the country music industry, where conservative themes are 
typically embraced by country artists like Sara Evans, Brooks & Dunn and the stalwart conservative Hank Williams, Jr.
