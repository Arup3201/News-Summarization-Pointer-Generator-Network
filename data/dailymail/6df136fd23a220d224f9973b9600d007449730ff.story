Commons Speaker John Bercow has confirmed Westminster’s worst-kept secret: he can be ‘bumptious and pompous’.

His frank admission comes in the final episode of Inside The Commons, the BBC2 fly-on-the-wall documentary.

The programme, by respected political documentary maker Michael Cockerell, to be broadcast on Tuesday, focuses on Mr Bercow’s stormy clashes with MPs in the Commons.

It also covers his reportedly fraught relationship with ex-Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers who quit last year after allegedly being told to ‘f*** off’ by the Speaker.

In this week’s documentary, alongside clips of Mr Bercow berating misbehaving MPs, Mr Cockerell says: ‘Many MPs say John Bercow is his own worst enemy because of his manner.’

The Speaker admits: ‘Some critics say I’m bumptious and can be pompous. If people say that, there may be truth in it.’

He defends efforts to modernise the Commons, saying: ‘It’s not possible to make an omelette without breaking eggs.’

But he admits he ‘lost’ his battle last year to replace Sir Robert with Australian parliamentary administrator Carol Mills amid protests she knew nothing about Commons procedure. 

Her appointment was blocked after a revolt by senior MPs.

Mr Bercow says: ‘There will be people who say, “the Speaker lost”. Well, that is undeniable. She has not been appointed.’
