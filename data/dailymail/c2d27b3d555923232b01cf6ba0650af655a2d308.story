Maverick: MP George Galloway has had his computer seized by police

Police have seized a Commons computer belonging to MP George Galloway as part of a probe into claims the maverick sanctioned the hacking of a former secretary’s private emails.

Scotland Yard said it was examining the laptop after a complaint that the Respect MP had authorised a lawyer to spy on the Hotmail account of Aisha Ali-Khan, suspended by Mr Galloway last October.

The Bradford West MP, who denies he condoned hacking, put down a Commons motion last year accusing Ms Ali-Khan of a dirty-tricks campaign against him with her husband, Afiz Khan, a member of the Metropolitan Police anti-terror squad.

He told MPs: ‘Afiz Khan sent emails to an individual in the Hon Member’s office who acted as his agent and co-ordinated this operation from his police email account and from at least two other fake email accounts.’

Mr Galloway’s claims led to the arrest of the couple on suspicion of data protection offences and, in Mr Khan’s case, of ‘abusing his position as a police officer’.

But now Scotland Yard is also investigating how Mr Galloway first became aware of the emails. Ms Ali-Khan, 32, a mother of one, has denied any campaign against Mr Galloway, saying the emails the MP saw were part of a private correspondence in which her husband was counselling her over ‘bullying and misogyny’ in the MP’s Bradford office.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that we have received an allegation that a computer has been hacked into. We have been given a laptop by the alleged victim.’

Mr Galloway’s spokesman said: ‘The police are duty-bound to investigate any allegations of this sort. The laptop they have seized is a parliamentary computer.  I am satisfied there has not been any illegal activity by anyone associated with Mr Galloway.’
