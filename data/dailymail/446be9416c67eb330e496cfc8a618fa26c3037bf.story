A Boston police department is being accused of trapping motorists with a fake pedestrian who is actually working undercover for the the cops.

In a video uploaded to YouTube, a bystander records footage of a man walking back and forth across an intersection in Somerville, Massachusetts.

Massachusetts law states that 'the driver of a vehicle shall yield right of way... to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within a crosswalk.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Trap: The alleged undercover crosswalker steps out onto the crosswalk in front of a stopped vehicle

Back and forth: Upon reaching the other side, he turns around and crosses again

Failure to do so is punishable by a fine of $200.

'Somerville police are using undercover crosswalkers to set up questionable traps at crosswalks throughout the town,' alleges the Free Thought Project.

'The undercover just walks back and forth in the crosswalk all day long, while the unit pulls over the unsuspecting “criminals” to issue a citation.'

The video shows a man walking back and forth across the crosswalk, thought to be at the intersection between Washington and Tufts Streets.

Not stopping: This car drives through the crosswalk as the pedestrian is walking through it

Hot pursuit: Moments later a police car emerges from around the corner to pull the motorist over for the infringement, which incurs a $200 fine

'If you don't stop, he'll get ya,' says the voice of the man taking the footage, adding that a police officer had yelled at him for taking the video.

Seconds after a motorist fails to stop as the walker begins crossing the intersection, a police car emerges from around a corner with its siren blazing.

According to voices on the video, this same ruse had been happening the day before.

The video was uploaded to Facebook last Monday and Somerville residents are already taking notice, with messages posted to the Somerville Police Department's Facebook page from residents to be undercover crosswalkers.
