Chelsea are 'taking no chances' with security when they head to France next month to play Paris Saint-Germain  and will ensure extra bodyguards are hired to protect their stars.

The Blues face Ligue 1 champions PSG for the second successive season in the Champions League when they go head to head in the last 16 of Europe's premier competition on Tuesday, February 17.

In the wake of last week's Charlie Hebdo terror attacks - during which 12 people were killed before another five died across the city - Chelsea will ensure they have heightened security.

Last week, 12 people were killed during the Charlie Hebdo Paris terror attacks 

Extra security guards will be hired by the Blues to protect players as they move in and around the French capital, and as they make their way to and from the Parc des Princes. 

A source told The Sun: 'They're taking no chances. It was almost inevitable after the horrific events.

'Player safety is the club's No 1 priority.'

Blues boss Jose Mourinho will try to guide his star-studded side through their Champions League last-16 tie

When the two sides met at the Parc des Princes last season in the Champions League quarter-final first leg, PSG triumphed 3-1 thanks to strikes from Ezequiel Lavezzi, Javier Pastore and a David Luiz own goal - with Eden Hazard replying from the penalty spot.

However, Chelsea turned things around in the second leg and progressed to the last four of the competition.

Goals from Andre Schurrle and Demba Ba gave Jose Mourinho's side the two-goal victory they needed at Stamford Bridge in order to reach the semi-finals.
