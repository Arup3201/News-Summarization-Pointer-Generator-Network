Emirates flight attendant Evelyn Clarke, 28, was found dead in a car park after falling from a window on the eighth floor of a Dubai tower block in the early hours of Monday

A British air hostess who plunged to her death from a Dubai tower block told building staff ‘someone’s trying to kill me’ in the minutes before her death.

Emirates flight attendant Evelyn Clarke, 28, was found dead in a car park after falling from a window on the eighth floor in the early hours of Monday.

Miss Clarke apparently ran into the lobby without any shoes on as she sought refuge from a man she believed was following her.

Police in Dubai are treating her death as an accident, but are continuing to question the last people who saw her alive.

Detectives are also examining why Miss Clarke seemingly pulled the pin out of a dry powder fire extinguisher in a narrow stairwell, which filled the area with a thick black smoke.

Staff at the residential block said they believe she may then have struggled to find her way down the stairs and opened the window, which is 3ft off the floor, to ‘escape the smoke’.

Blackened fingerprints were still visible yesterday on the walls and window frames in the stairwell, as well as on a door, which led to a locked ‘lift mechanics’ room.

A newspaper delivery man said Miss Clarke entered the Afaf building in Bur Dubai at about 4.15am and appeared ‘drunk’ and in distress.

He also saw a man who Miss Clarke may have feared was following her.

He said: 'She had no shoes on. I got into the elevator to go up to the fourth floor. But just as the doors were closing, the woman put her hand in to stop the lift and stepped inside. The man did not take the lift.

‘She was cowering with fear and it appeared she was being followed by the South Asian man.

She kept saying “Someone is trying to kill me”. As she spoke, there was a strong smell of alcohol. I told her to call the police or I could do it for her. But she said no.’ 

Miss Clarke, from Ayrshire, Scotland, reportedly got out on the third floor and headed towards the stairwell, while the delivery man continued to distribute papers to the fourth and fifth floors.

When he returned to the lobby he told security guard Mozammal Haque Bhulyan, who had been on a break when Miss Clarke arrived, about the incident.

Mr Bhulyan, 33, told the Mail: ‘I 
searched all the floors and, when I got to the second floor, I heard a 
loud bang. I think now that was Miss Clarke falling.’

He
searched the building twice but initially did not think to check the 
eighth floor, which holds a locked rooftop terrace and the mechanics 
room, because it is usually for ‘authorised personnel’ only.

However, when he failed to find Miss 
Clarke, he opened the door to the eighth floor stairwell and was shocked
to discover it was filled with a black powder. 

He said: ‘I got very scared for her. I thought the powder was smoke, so I thought perhaps there had been a fire.

‘I ran to the watchman’s flat on the third floor and asked him to check the stairwell because there was smoke, while I went outside.’

The watchman discovered an open window and a woman’s brown handbag on the floor nearby. Next to the handbag was a pin for the fire extinguisher, which was still hanging on the wall.

Mr Bhulyan said: ‘I think when she used the fire extinguisher she couldn’t see anything or anywhere to escape. Maybe she opened the window and fell or jumped.’

He walked around the outside of the building, where he found Miss Clarke’s body beneath the eighth floor window. He made the discovery at 4.37am, around 20 minutes after she entered the building.

‘She had already died,’ he said. Mr Bhulyan, a father-of-one from Bangladesh, added: ‘It is very sad.’

Miss Clarke had been working for Emirates since June and, two days prior to her death, had returned from a six-day working trip to Brisbane and Auckland

He questioned why she had entered the ordinary residential building, saying: ‘I don’t know why she was in here at night. She was definitely not living here.

'The air hostesses live in high-class buildings owned by Emirates. There is one just up the road. But this building is normal, it is not the quality that they are used to.’

He said he understood the newspaper delivery man saw an Indian man follow Miss Clarke into the building and loiter in the lobby. He added: ‘He did not enter the elevator and he was not a resident here.’

The delivery man added: ‘When I [returned to] the lobby, the man was still there and asked me in Hindi if the woman lived in the building. I ignored him and walked away.’

It is still unclear what Miss Clarke was doing in the residential Bur Dubai district, two miles from her flat.

She is understood to have shared a three-bedroom apartment with fellow air hostesses in a 28-floor apartment block for Emirates staff, in the heart of the business district.

Reports suggested she was on a night out with friends and may have gone on to an after-party when Dubai’s bars shut at 3am.

She had been working for Emirates since June and, two days prior to her death, had returned from a six-day working trip to Brisbane and Auckland.

Her parents Edmund and Maryann and brother Ryan, 23, are believed to have flown out to Dubai.

A spokesman for Emirates said: ‘Our sympathies go out to her family who are currently being supported by our staff.’

On a Facebook tribute page, friends said Miss Clarke had ‘a heart of gold’ and ‘wanted to help everyone in need’.

An Indian man also reportedly died the same night in Dubai from falling from a 10th-floor apartment.
