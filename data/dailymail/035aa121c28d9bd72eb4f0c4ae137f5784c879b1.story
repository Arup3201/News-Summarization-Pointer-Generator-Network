It will go down in the annals of football history as the Sack of Rome. Bayern Munich's masterclass on Tuesday night left them in seventh heaven and Roma utterly humiliated.

A double from Arjen Robben, plus goals from Mario Gotze, Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller had Bayern five goals up at half-time before Franck Ribery and Xherdan Shaqiri scored late on to make the final score 7-1.

In celebration, we take a look back at 10 other occasions in the Champions League era (post-1992) when a European heavyweight has thrashed another leading side.

Manchester United 7 Roma 1

Quarter-final, second leg - April 2007

Tuesday night was not the first time Roma have suffered in Europe's premier club competition. They were humiliated by Manchester United in the last eight back in 2007, one of the English club's most emphatic performances on the continental stage.

Sir Alex Ferguson's team were trailing 2-1 from the first leg in Italy but soon cancelled out that deficit with goals inside the opening 20 minutes from Michael Carrick, Alan Smith and Wayne Rooney.

With Old Trafford euphoric, Cristiano Ronaldo's double either side of half-time settled the contest before a Carrick stunner and a late Patrice Evra strike completed the rout.

Bayern Munich 0 Real Madrid 4

Semi-final, second leg - April 2014

Bayern may have dealt out a footballing lesson this time but they were on the end of a hiding last season. The defending European champions only trailed Real by one goal following the first leg in Madrid and were confident of overturning the deficit on their own turf.

It didn't go according to plan. Sergio Ramos scored two headers inside the opening 20 minutes to put clear daylight between the two teams before Gareth Bale set Cristiano Ronaldo racing clear to slot home the third.

The Portuguese then curled a free-kick under a jumping Bayern wall to round off a sensational performance. Real would go on to end their long wait for a 10th European crown.

Liverpool 4 Real Madrid 0

Last 16, second leg - March 2009

Perhaps this glorious Anfield European night is an omen for Wednesday's meeting. Fernando Torres produced an exhilarating display to guide Rafa Benitez's men to a famous victory.

The Spain striker had only just returned from injury but gave Liverpool the lead after 16 minutes when he turned in Dirk Kuyt's cross.

Former Manchester United defender Gabriel Heinze was then penalised for handball and Steven Gerrard slotted home the penalty.

The captain then fired home his second of the evening shortly after the break before Andrea Dossena rounded off a classy win late on.

Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0

Group stage - November 1994

United ran into Johan Cryuff's 'Dream Team' at precisely the wrong time. Battered 4-0 by AC Milan in the previous season's final (see below), Barca had a lot to prove. The first group game at Old Trafford ended a 2-2 draw - Hughes and Lee Sharpe scoring for United, Romario and Jose Mari Bakero for Barca.

In the return the following month, the wonderful forward pairing of Hristo Stoitchkov and Romario were superb on the night, ripping apart a United side robbed of goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel due to the limit on foreign players. Stoitchkov (2), Romario and Albert Ferrer all found a way past Gary Walsh and his bewildered backline.

AC Milan 4 Barcelona 0

Final - May 1994

The Milan coach Fabio Capello revelled in a 'perfect night' as his team tore Cryuff's mighty Barcelona team apart in Athens.

With Romario, Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman in their ranks, Barca started as favourites but Milan were in command at half-time thanks to a double from Daniele Massaro.

Further goals from Dejan Savicevic and Marcel Desailly early in the second period rounded off the largest win in a Champions League final.

Capello, reflecting on that night, said: 'Everyone at the time thought Barcelona were the best team and that they were impossible to beat. This was a motivation for my players.'

Borussia Dortmund 4 Real Madrid 1

Semi-final, first leg - April 2013

Robert Lewandowski produced a striker's masterclass, scoring all four goals as underdogs Borussia Dortmund thrashed Real at a delirious Westfalenstadion.

The Poland frontman volleyed in a Mario Gotze cross to give the Bundesliga side the lead, but Cristiano Ronaldo equalised.

Lewandowski then scored twice in the space of five minutes to put Dortmund in firm control and then coverted a fourth from the spot after Marco Reus had been fouled.

Real won the second leg 2-0 but it was insufficient to overturn the deficit inflicted by rampant Lewandowski.

Inter Milan 1 Arsenal 5

Group stage - November 2003

Thierry Henry inspired Arsenal to a win for the ages as Arsene Wenger's 'Invincibles' started to click into top gear.

The French maestro opened the scoring midway through the first half but Inter equalised through a deflected Christian Vieri strike.

The Gunners seized control after the break, restoring their lead through Freddie Ljungberg before Henry made sure of the win with a fabulous individual effort.

Edu made it four before Robert Pires rounded things off late on. 'Not in my wildest dreams could we have predicted that sort of result,' Wenger said afterwards.

AC Milan 4 Arsenal 0

Last 16, first leg - February 2012

The Gunners returned to the San Siro nine years later for a knockout tie with AC Milan and were on the receiving end of a thrashing.

They trailed to a superb goal from Kevin-Prince Boateng on 15 minutes and a double from Brazilian star Robinho put Milan firmly in command.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic's penalty with 11 minutes remaining consigned Arsenal to their heaviest European defeat.

Incredibly, the Gunners nearly overturned the deficit at the Emirates. They scored three times in the first half of the return but couldn't find a fourth.

Bayern Munich 4 Barcelona 0

Semi-final, first leg - April 2013

A result that signalled the shift of power from Spain to Germany - for one season at least.

Jupp Heynckes' side had just been confirmed Bundesliga champions in record time and produced a sensational performance at the Allianz Arena to take a firm grip on the tie.

Thomas Muller's goal book-ended the four-goal rout, with Mario Gomez and Arjen Robben scoring in between.

Bayern underlined their superiority by winning the return in the Nou Camp 3-0 and went on to beat Borussia Dortmund in the final at Wembley.

Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1

Quarter-final, second leg - April 2010

Lionel Messi produced one of his finest performances for Barcelona as they came from behind to thrash Arsenal in the Nou Camp.

The Gunners had hauled themselves back from two goals down in the home leg and incredibly went ahead of aggregate in Catalonia when Nicklas Bendtner scored.

Magical Messi then took control, driving home an equaliser before taking in Pedro's pass to add a second.

He capped off a first-half hat-trick with a stylish lob and then scored a fourth late on with a trademark individual effort.

Liverpool hold the record for the largest margin of victory in the Champions League with their 8-0 rout of Turkish side Besiktas in 2007-2008.

If the qualifying rounds are also included, the record is HJK Helsinki's 10-0 win over Bangor City in the 2011-2012 second qualifying round.
