A teenager who drunkenly posted a picture of himself burning a poppy on Facebook was in police custody last night.

Officers arrested Linford House after they received a complaint about the image that was published in the early hours of Remembrance Sunday.

When police called at his parents’ home that evening, the 19-year-old had already taken down the image on a friend’s advice..

A man, named locally as Linford House (pictured right), 19, was arrested yesterday after the image (left) appeared online. The words on the right image have been written on by a third party, who posted it online

It showed a cigarette lighter with a 
flame catching light to the bottom of a poppy, allegedly with the words:
 ‘How about that you squadey [sic] ****s’.

The student was questioned by 
detectives for several hours yesterday afternoon and last night he was 
still in custody facing a second night behind bars.

His father Keith, 50, branded him ‘idiotic’ and said the whole family had been disappointed by his behaviour.

But he questioned whether it was right to hold the teenager.

‘He has been stupid but it’s totally 
out of order to arrest him over one complaint,’ he said. ‘I would have 
preferred if they had come, taken him to the police station and told him
 off.

‘We’ve been told he cannot stay at 
ours and should go to relatives or friends in case people are out there 
wanting to carry out reprisal attacks. That’s the advice of the police. 
We’ve had loads of phone calls from people who are angry and outraged.’

He said his son had got very drunk at a
 party before he posted the picture: ‘He was woken up by a phone call 
from one of my mates telling him to remove it. He couldn’t remember 
putting it up.

‘He deleted it as soon as he realised. The next thing we know is that he has been arrested.’

House was arrested under the Malicious
 Communications Act, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in 
jail and/or a £5,000 fine. His grandmother Valerie said: ‘He’s been an 
idiot while drunk but the police have gone over the top on this one.’

The family from Aylesham near 
Canterbury has the support of civil liberties groups, which claim the 
arrest is an infringement of free speech.

Nick Pickles, from pressure group Big 
Brother Watch, said: ‘It is not illegal to offend people and, however 
idiotic or insensitive the picture may have been, it is certainly not 
worthy of arrest.

‘The case highlights the urgent need 
to reform a law that poses a serious risk to freedom of speech.’ Agnes 
Callamard, of the Article 19 campaign group, said: ‘Causing offence, 
showing poor judgment or expressing views which people find to be in bad
 taste should not amount to criminal prosecution.’

Does the arrest of a man for posting a picture of a burning poppy threaten free speech?

But war veterans and community leaders reacted with disgust at the poppy-burning stunt.

‘It’s absolutely disgusting and 
disgraceful what this lad allegedly did,’ said Granville Cosier, a local
 councillor and ex-serviceman. ‘I’m sure any right-minded person would 
agree with me that whoever did it should be dealt with and severely 
punished.

‘Even if he says he was drunk or under the influence of drugs, it doesn’t excuse what was done.’

Bob Thompson, another local councillor, said: ‘The image on the internet has cast a dark shadow over Remembrance Day.’

House is on a practical environmental 
studies building course and is a member of the Snowdown Colliery Rugby 
Football Club where his father is club captain.

Kent Police said yesterday: ‘Following
 an investigation, a 19-year-old Canterbury man was arrested on 
suspicion of an offence under the Malicious Communications Act.’

In March last year, Emdadur Choudhury,
 of Muslims Against Crusades, was fined £50 for burning replica poppies 
on Armistice Day. Convictions for internet abuse have more than doubled 
in the space of five years, alongside the enormous growth in social 
media sites.

The number has grown from 498 in 2007 to 1,286 in 2011

Last
 year, Police in Northern Ireland arrested a number of people after a 
picture of two youths burning a poppy was posted on Facebook.

And Emdadur
 Choudhury, a member of Muslims Against Crusades (MAC), was found guilty of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour, after he burned replica poppies during a two-minute silence on 
Remembrance Day in 2010.

The maximum fine possible was £1,000, plus legal costs, yet he was fined only £50, plus a £15 victim surcharge.

A second man was cleared of the same offence due to 'lack of evidence'.
