The Youngs brothers did enough to fill another family album at Welford Road on Friday night as the Tigers stormed to a bonus-point victory which just about keeps their European campaign alive.

Leicester had taken care of business by the 53rd minute of this Pool 3 encounter. That was when they claimed the crucial fourth try which put them temporarily level on points with pool leaders Toulon. 

Richard Cockerill’s side must somehow exorcise their ghosts at Ravenhill next weekend by beating Ulster with another four-try haul if they are to give themselves even a faint chance of reaching the quarter-finals, but they are still in the mix.

For that, they owe a lot to their super siblings. Ben Youngs inspired the Tigers with a vintage, vibrant performance which enhances his prospects of retaining his England scrum-half place next month, and brother Tom came off the bench to score two second-half tries.

The Scarlets arrived at Welford Road without Wales trio Ken Owens, Samson Lee and Liam Williams, and the absence of these key men left the visitors vulnerable, especially up front.

Bath-bound No 10 Rhys Priestland put them ahead with a sixth-minute penalty, only for Leicester to seize the initiative with two tries in five minutes.

From an attacking lineout, Samoan prop Lugovi’i Mulipola marked his comeback from injury with an explosive burst over the gainline. The ball was deftly transferred via Adam Thompstone and Mathew Tait to Miles Benjamin, and the wing touched down on the left. Freddie Burns added the wide conversion and was on target again shortly afterwards, following a staple try from the Tigers repertoire.

Again, Tom Croft caught the ball at a lineout in the Scarlets’ 22 and the pack drove over for Jordan Crane to score.

It appeared the writing was on the wall for the visitors, but whenever they had possession they looked threatening.

Priestland narrowed the gap with a penalty and after Leicester lock Graham Kitchener was sin-binned for a ruck offence, the Scarlets hit back, as the forwards rumbled through the 22 from a lineout drive and prop Rob Evans peeled off the maul to force his way over.

Yet the contest became a procession after the break. Ben Youngs and Tait cleared the way for Thompstone to score in the 47th minute and Tom Youngs’ try from a lineout drive brought the bonus, before the England hooker struck after his brother carved into the 22.

Harry Robinson went over twice at the other end but Leicester kept swarming forward and Sam Harrison scored their sixth try from Robert Barbieri’s superb drive and off-load.
