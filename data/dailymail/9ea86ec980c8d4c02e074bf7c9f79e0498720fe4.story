Thousands of protesters demanding the resignation of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy demonstrated in Madrid and Barcelona last night.

They took to the streets to call on Rajoy, the leader of the Popular Party who has been Prime Minister since 2011, to stand down over claims he took money from a government slush-fund.

What started as a peaceful event turned violent when riot police clashed with some protesters, leaving many people from both sides injured.

There were violent clashes in Madrid last night after proteters called for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to resign

Last night's protest had not been expected and saw thousands of people marching in the Spanish capital

The protesters packed the streets outside the Madrid headquarters of Rajoy's Popular Party, insisting that he should leave office because of allegations he received payoffs from a slush fund before his party won elections in 2011.

They marched through the city in demonstrations that had not been expected but began peacefully.

Shortly before midnight, groups of protesters in Madrid's Plaza de Cibeles clashed with police wielding batons.Â  The protesters charged the police on several occasions and were beaten back by officers.

Those injured included a police officer hurt by a flying projectile and a protestor with a bloodied face, while some of the protesters were arrested by authorities.

The demonstrations came after opposition leaders this week called for Rajoy to explain himself before Parliament or face a censure vote.

Critics of the 58-year-old politician said he should resign after text messages emerged showing him comforting a former political party treasurer under investigation over a slush fund and secret Swiss bank accounts.

The treasurer has claimed Rajoy took under-the-counter payments, accusations denied by Rajoy who has brushed off the calls for him to stand down.

The scandal first emerged in January when Spanish newspaper El Pais published copies of account ledgers purportedly showing irregular payments to top party members.

Further leaks of supposed statements implicated the grey-bearded premier himself.

The spectacle of alleged greed and corruption has enraged Spaniards who are already suffering with austerity measures and sky-high unemployment.
