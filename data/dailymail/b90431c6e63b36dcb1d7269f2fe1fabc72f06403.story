Design stars like Pharrell Williams, Rick Owens, and the Missoni clan have reinvented the official World Cup soccer ball for charity.

The one-off creations, being auctioned off on eBay by luxury fashion retailer Luisaviaroma, are expected to sell for anywhere between $200 and $1,000.

Missoni's design is the most transformative - as the label has deconstructed the soccer ball to create a collection of petals, which was fashioned into a decorative lotus structure.

Simpler approach: A known doodle-r, Pharrell Williams decorated his soccer ball with tiny hand drawings

Pharrell's soccer ball is the exact opposite - as the singer, a known doodler, simply took a pen and scattered it with tiny drawings as well as his signature.

Other contributors, like Roberto Cavalli, made a soccer ball that is completely representative of his brand.

Like much of his clothes, the ball is covered in rhinestones and an animal print.

Similarly, fashion's reigning prince of darkness Rick Owens, bleached out the ball's colorful design and covered it in a gothic drawing.

The balls are being auctioned in small 
groups. Currently up for bids, with four days left to go, are pieces by 
mostly Italian designers Dolce & Gabbana, Antonio Marras, and Etro -
 which show off the country's splendid hand at embellished, colorful 
designs.

The entire lot benefits the Gol de Letra Foundation â€“ a charity that benefits Brazilian youth programs.

The World Cup is currently under way and will end next month, on July 16, with a massive trophy presentation.
