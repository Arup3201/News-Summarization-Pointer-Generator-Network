Americans who support the death penalty would rather see states bring back the hangman's noose, the electric chair, the gas chamber, the firing squad - or even the guillotine - than stop executions if lethal injection is no longer available.

A new NBC News poll found 59percent of Americans support the death penalty for people convicted of murder.

The findings reveal that the botched execution of Oklahoma murderer Clayton Lockett on April 29 has not dampened public support for capital punishment.

No change: The botched execution of Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett hasn't dampened public enthusiasm for execution

Should the U.S. bring back other execution techniques if lethal injection is not available?

If anything, it's made Americans believe more primitive methods of execution are more humane than lethal injection.

All 35 states with the death penalty use either a cocktail of drugs or a single drug for executions. Those drugs have become harder to get in recent years as drug makers stop production - either for financial reasons or because they don't want to be associated with executions.

NBC News found large support for other means of execution. Some 20percent say they would favor bringing back the gas chamber, 18percent would favor a return of the electric chair, 12 percent the firing squad and eight percent say hanging should be an option.

The results of NBC's poll of 800 Americans reveals:

'The lethal injection is someone’s very gross interpretation of killing someone humanely,' Frisco, Texas-native Kuni Beasley, 58, told NBC. He called for return of the hanging gallows.

'It's very quick. You don't have to worry about drugs and it's very efficient. Better than a firing squad - a firing squad is messy. There is no such thing as killing someone humanely.

'But if hanging is done properly, it's more humane than lethal injection because there are fewer things that can go wrong.'

Afterall, Mr Beasley said, 'that's how they killed Saddam Hussein.'

Gladys Pringle, an 82-year-old from Port Royal, Pennsylvania, thinks the U.S. should look even farther back in history to find execution methods.

'It would be quick and with a firing squad no one knows whose bullet actually killed the person, so it’s easier on them,' she said.

'The most humane way is the guillotine but I can’t see that coming back.'

The NBC poll asked questions of 800 registered voters between May 7 and 10. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.46percent.
