A 'conveyor belt' of winter storms heading for the UK is set to batter the country with heavy rain and wind throughout the week. 

The bad weather will be blown in from the Atlantic this evening, with winds of 50mph expected in parts of the country overnight in the first of a 'succession' of storms.

Heavy downpours and a drop in temperature will continue over the weekend after one of the warmest autumns on record, forecasters said this morning. 

The Met Office has issued a yellow rain warning for parts of the south west and Wales, with strong gusts expected to batter the region.

Clear skies over Ombersley, Worcestershire, this morning. The West Midlands can expect rain today with most of the country, with the South West and Wales to be worst affected by the incoming storms 

There will be breaks in the bad weather on Wednesday and Thursday, with quieter conditions expected across most of the country similar to those in the West Midlands today

'The band of rain will edge into the South West and parts of northern Ireland this afternoon, then progress eastwards,' Kate Brown, a Met Office forecaster said.

'On Tuesday there is a yellow rain warning in place for those parts of the country from just after midnight although there will be some rain beforehand. 

'It's a succession of wet weather, an unsettled picture. Tonight is just one rain band that will move north and eastwards over Britain,' she added. 

'Thursday looks like it may be a quieter day, there's probably going to be a fairly decent dry day but Thursday into Friday we're looking at getting some heavy rain. Friday is going to be rather wet.

'The strongest winds will be focused in the same area as the rainfall, it does look like there'll be some strong gusts on the south coast Pembrokeshire coast.

'The South East will stay dry tonight and it's not really going to get into Scotland until the early hours but most other places will see some rain. The majority of people will see downpour.'

'The public should be aware of the risk of localised flooding, perhaps exacerbated by fallen leaves blocking drainage courses.'

There has been a dramatic drop in temperature since last week, with the warmest weather expected in the Channel on the Isle of Portland, at 14.2C. 

Loch Glascarnoch, near Inverness could be as cold as -2C. 

Yesterday much of the country awoke to clear and crisp conditions after one of the wettest Saturdays of the year.

The Environment Agency has issued flood alerts in 21 areas in anticipation of this week's weather while local authorities have placed control-teams on alert.    

Temperatures are expected to be milder than is usual throughout winter, with the Met Office advising: 'As the outlook covers the transition from autumn into winter, there can be big changes in how UK weather is influenced by prevailing weather patterns during the period.'

Forecasters predict heavy downpour and winds across parts of the country this week as winter storms move over Britain

A forecast until December 8 said: 'Bands of more persistent rain may spread in from the West at times but eastern parts should see the driest interludes. Windy, with gales possible in places, and temperatures mainly near normal. 

'Into the following week, there are indications of a gradual trend for heavier and more persistent spells of rain to affect eastern Britain.

'Current indications show that low pressure is likely to be located to the west of the UK, and as such the most likely scenario is for unsettled weather to continue in most places as we head into December.'

Saturday saw Guy Fawkes celebrations and sporting fixtures across the country come to a halt with torrential downpour lasting long into the night. 

Ten days worth of rain fell in the South East in just six hours, with the Met Office issuing a warning for surface level flooding. 

Weather Channel forecaster Leon Brown said: 'There is a widespread flood risk with persistent rain from late Thursday.

'Parts of eastern Scotland may see persistent rain from late Thursday to Sunday, with 100mm-plus over the south and east Highlands and up to over 150mm of rainfall on the southern slopes of the Grampians.'
