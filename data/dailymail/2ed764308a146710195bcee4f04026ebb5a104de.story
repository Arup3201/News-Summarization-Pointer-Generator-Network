After being stolen from her eight years ago, single mother Lashena Harris had come to terms with that fact that she would never see her English Bulldog Fatcat again.

The dog was taken from her Memphis, Tennesse home when it was just two years old, and Ms Harris has since moved halfway across the country - all the way to Phoenix, Arizona. 

So it is safe to say she was a little shocked when she received a phone call, telling her Fatcat had been found dumped by the roadside in West Memphis, Arkansas. 

Reunited: Recent pictures of Fatcat, who has been returned to her owner eight years after being stolen

Even once Ms Harris, 34, had heard the incredible news, it looked like they might never be reunited - as making the near 3,000 mile round trip looked an impossible task.

As a working single mother she was not able to drive the mammoth trip, and because of the condition Fatcat was in, putting in her a crate in the hold of a plane would have been too much stress for her to take.

As soon as the amazing story had begun, it looked as if it might end tragically, and Ms Harris was faced with the horrifying call of having her long-lost dog put down.

It was only by complete chance that a worker at the shelter Fatcat had been taken to happened to have a friend moving to Arizona, and they said they would drive the dog there and reunite her with her overjoyed owner. 

Great to be back: Lashena Harris and Fatcat were overjoyed to be brought back together

'I stopped in the driveway entrance of the lot and ran over to her,' she told AZCentral.com. 'I can't really put into words the feelings because I just kept saying thank you, thank you, thank you so much. I never thought I would see her again — in came the tears and boo-hooing.'

She said Fatcat rolled over onto her back to have her tummy scratched when they were reunited, and then rode home with her in the front seat, head flopped in her lap. 

She wrote on her Go Fund Me page, set up to get donations to help pay for the dog's veterinary care: 'Overjoyed isn't the word... I cried like a baby at hearing she was found. But, of course, I knew if someone had turned her in, it was because they were done with her.'

When Fatcat was found she was in awful condition - she had tumours, periodontal disease and heartworms, along with other conditions.

She couple who found her had taken her to the vets, but could not afford to pay for the treatment.

And it was only when she was taken to a shelter, where her microchip was scanned, that Fatcat was linked back to Ms Harris.

Rare: The all-while English Bulldog's puppies would have been worth around $4,000 each to the thieves

It is believed that whoever had stolen Fatcat had used her to breed puppies, and dumped her when she became too ill to be useful.

'I can't see someone having a dog for that long and not creating some attachment to it,' Ms Harris told Fox10News.

'Apparently she was just a puppy mill for him and when she could no longer be used, they dumped her.

'What are the chances of us four crossing paths in this manner? This wasn't supposed to happen and it did.'

White bulldogs are very rare, and Fatcat's puppies could have made as much as $4,000 each for the people who took her.

Now that the miracle is complete Ms Harris is doing her best to give her the best possible end to her traumatic life.

She has set up a Go Fund Me page called 'Operation welcome home Fatcat' to try to raise the $5,000 she needs to pay for her veterinary care.

'She's had a hard life and I just want to make her as comfortable as possible while she's home,' she said. 

Ms Harris said that her 14-year-old son, who was just eight when the pet disappeared, was delighted to see her again.
