Sony has announced that its PlayStation 4 console will be available in the UK from 29 November for £349

Sony has announced the launch date for its eagerly anticipated PlayStation 4 console.

Gamers in the UK will be able to get their hands on it from November 29 - two weeks after it goes on sale in the U.S.

The console will be available in 
32 countries worldwide and will cost £349 in the UK - £80 cheaper than Microsoft's Xbox One - and $399 in the U.S.

Sony unveiled its next-generation console during the 
Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles in June.

The black PS4 will come with 8GB of memory, additional hard drive space and a new DualShock 4 controller with a motion sensor bar and touchpad.

Gamers will also be able to buy extra controllers in new colours 'Magma Red' and 'Wave Blue' for £54.

During the announcement at Gamescom in Germany, Sony also announced it was cutting the price of of its handheld console, the PlayStation Vita.

The Wi-Fi version of the device would now drop by $50 to $199 (£127) excluding tax in the U.S.

When the PS4 console goes on sale, Sony's PS will be reduced to $199 in the U.S and €199 in Europe.

The UK price reductions for both the Vita and PS3 have not yet been officially announced.

The PS4 already has a million pre-orders, according to Sony, but gaming experts said the launch date could play into the hands of main rival Microsoft, which has yet to announce when its Xbox One will go on sale.

Althought the company has hinted it will be sometime in the same month as the PS4.

'From Microsoft's point of view it looks pretty good,' said Seth Barton of technology website Expert Reviews.

'I think Microsoft will probably want to get in first and launch a week or two before Sony just to claw back a bit of an edge.

The PS4 console will come with the DualShock 4 controller that has a motion sensor bar that links with a sensing device on the console, and a touchpad. Gamers will also be able to buy extra controllers in new colours 'Magma Red' and 'Wave Blue', pictured, for an extra £54

'If you've got a PS4 pre-order you will definitely get one for Christmas, but if you haven't then that boat has sailed and you haven't got a hope of getting one, and then you might end up getting a Microsoft instead.'

He added: 'It's quite possible both consoles will sell out before Christmas and you won't be able to get either of them.'

Last week it emerged that retailers were halting pre-orders of the PS4, prompting fears of a shortage at Christmas.

A high level of interest in the £349 console is leading to shops warning customers that new orders will not guarantee a machine at launch.

Microsoft has said the Xbox One will set gamers back £429 when it launches some time in November.

Sony first gave a sneak preview of the PS4 earlier in the year.

The Japanese firm said the 'gaming experience' is at the heart of its latest console, with the device including a feature which allows gamers to broadcast a live stream of their play.

PS4 provides access to social networks including Facebook and Twitter while Sony has also promised to develop cloud technology to enable users to play their old games via the internet.

Anticipation is high because it is seven years since the last PlayStation and eight years since the previous Xbox.

Virgin Media has been confirmed as the broadband partner for the PS4, but no further details were given.

When the console was announced in June, the loudest applause came when Jack Tretton, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, announced that the company would not try to restrict used game sales.

Tretton was making reference to Microsoft's plans to restrict second-hand game sales on its Xbox One console. 

During its own E3 event earlier the same day, Microsoft confirmed that every game bought for the Xbox One must be installed to the system and linked to the user's profile.

The games can then be played on other consoles, but the user will have to access it through a cloud server each time.

Other people's profiles can play games on a user's console at any time, and up to ten family members can log in and play shared games on other systems, but not at the same time.

Tretton also announced that the PS4 would not require a persistent online connection.

Friends
can watch as you play a game, and you'll even be able to let a pal take
control of your game from afar if you can't get past a tough battle.

The DualShock controller weighs around 210g.

It has a two-point touchpad and six-axis Move motion sensor that works with a 3D camera placed near the TV set.

Other features include a Light Bar, Vibration and a built-in mono speaker.

The controller will be available at launch for $59 in the U.S and £54 in the UK.

The 3D camera will cost $59 (U.S) and £44 (UK) at launch.

Both accessories will come in the same 'Jet Black' colour as the console.

Bookmakers Paddy Power slashed the odds on Playstation 4 outselling the Xbox One in 2013 following Sony's announcement that it will retail for £79 less than its rival.

It chopped the odds on the Playstation 4 being the top selling console in 2013 from 4/11 to 2/9 while the Xbox One’s odds drifted from 15/8 to 11/4.

A spokesperson for Paddy Power said 'There’s still a long way to go but the huge variation in price has certainly handed the advantage to Playstation and we reckon that there’ll be more girlfriends cursing Sony than Microsoft this Christmas.'
