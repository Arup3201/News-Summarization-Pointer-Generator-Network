The four surviving medieval copies of Magna Carta will be brought together for the first time in history in 2015.

The date is 800 years after the issue of the Charter by King John in 1215.

The unification will be held at the British Library for three days in early 2015 and will kick off a year of celebrations across the UK and the world.

The event is taking place in collaboration with Lincoln Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral, where two original copies of Magna Carta are usually kept.

The other two copies are housed safely at the British Library.

It will provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for researchers and the public to see all four documents side-by-side.

History buffs will be able to enter a ballot to win one of 1,215 free tickets to see the unified Medieval manuscripts.

The papers will be examined in the British Library’s Conservation Centre by some of the world’s leading experts on the documents.

Experts are currently undertaking a major research project on Magna Carta and the charters of King John, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.

This unique opportunity will allow the historians involved to study faded or obscured parts of the text more closely and to look for new clues about the identity of the writers of the texts, which is currently unknown.

Magna Carta, meaning ‘The Great Charter’, was issued by King John of England as a practical solution to the political crisis he faced in 1215. 

Written in Latin on parchment, Magna Carta established for the first time that the king was subject to the law, rather than above it.

Although nearly a third of the text was dropped or substantially rewritten within ten years and almost all the clauses have been repealed in modern times.

However, Magna Carta remains a cornerstone of the British Constitution and its principles are echoed in the US constitution and others around the world.

There are four remaining copies of the Magna Carta. Two are kept at the British Library, one at Sailsbury Cathedral (pictured left) and another copy (pictured right) at Lincoln Cathedral

It has been used in many ways since 
the Middle Ages but it has become a potent, international rallying cry 
against the arbitrary use of power.

The British Library is staging an exhibition about the medieval charter.

Lincoln Cathedral is opening a Magna Carta centre in Lincoln Castle, while Sailsbury Cathedral will host educational and outreach events to celebrate the 800 year anniversary.

Claire Breay, Lead Curator of Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts at the British Library, says: 'Magna Carta is the most popular item in the Library’s Treasures gallery, and is venerated around the world as marking the starting point for government under the law.

'Bringing the four surviving manuscripts together for the first time will create a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for researchers and members of the public to see them in one place.'

The Dean of Salisbury, the Very Reverend June Osborne, said: 'Magna Carta’s clauses on social justice are as relevant today as they were 800 years ago and are at the heart of all we aspire to.

'We hope the publicity generated through the planned unification and 800th anniversary year will increase awareness of its importance, values, ideals and modern significance to a huge new audience.'

Richard Godden, a partner at Linklaters, a law firm that is supporting the reunification, said: 'Magna Carter is a foundation stone of the Rule of Law and its influence extends around the world.

'The arbitrary authority of the state is just as much a threat today as it was in the day of King John and the principles enshrined in Magna Carta remain essential not only in relation to personal liberty but to creating an environment in which business can prosper.

We forget them at our peril.'
