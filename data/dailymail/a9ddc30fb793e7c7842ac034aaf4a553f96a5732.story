A child victim who was beaten and sexually abused for years by their father has defended their mother and the man's second wife for their alleged roles in the sickening pedophile ring where incest and bestiality was discovered.

Christopher Sena, 47, his wife Deborah Sena, 50, and ex-wife Terrie Sena have been accused of abusing at least eight children over 13 years in their Las Vegas trailer-park home. 

The three allegedly took part in underage, incestuous video-taped sex attacks and were arrested last year. 

Terrie Sena, 43, agreed to a plea deal in January with Clark County prosecutors on one count of sexual assault that could put her behind bars for 10 years to life.

Deborah Sena was offered the same deal, but her attorney said she was a victim and her husband made her take part. 

Her defense attorney, Kristina Wildeveld, told the Review-Journal: 'She was coerced, threatened, blackmailed, beaten, by Chris Sena.

'I'm very uncomfortable with a victim of domestic violence signing up for 10 to life in prison for something that she never was an active participant in.'

The statement was seconded by a victim of the sickening sexual abuse, who is now an adult.

In a letter to the Las Vegas Review-Journal this week, the victim said the mothers should not face jail because they were also subjected to years of torture and sexual abuse.

The victim said the women, like the child victims, lived in constant fear and were monitored 24/7 by Sena, under threats of violence.

Christopher Sena has been accused of sexually abusing his children and filming them in sickening acts for more than ten years 

The letter read: 'Christopher would ask them if (Deborah or Terrie Sena) would like to take the punishment instead of us.

'And they would take those beatings for us.' 

The victim also added in the letter: 'Our father is in jail, where he belongs. 

'And the absence of our mothers continues to victimize us kids.'

Christopher Sena was arrested in September as part of a SWAT team operation and recording equipment seized from the home. 

Authorities allegedly found footage of Deborah Sena, who left her husband last August and reported the abuse, involved in sexual acts with the family dog.

She claimed her husband told her she would do what he wanted if she loved him.

One of the seized recordings also allegedly shows two  children having sex with the family dog,The Daily Beast reported.  

Sena faces 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse. Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison.

The 47-year-old is due in court for a preliminary hearing in April.  

The women, who were arrested on December 11, together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor and incest.

All three have been held without bail.

Terrie and Christopher Sena had three sons and a daughter together before splitting in 1997. 

But after they split, Terrie continued to live with her ex and their children, even when he took a new wife, Deborah.

Authorities allegedly found videos showing all three adults engaging in sex acts with children.

At least eight minors were involved and some encounters were filmed as part of a child porn operation, police said. 

One  victim told authorities that when Sena started abusing her as a child, the two women were not aware of it, but when she was 17, she was forced to engage in sexual activity with them.

That victim started to strike her stomach with a piece of wood, fearful that she would fall pregnant with Sena's child.

Some of the victims say they were abused for years; one boy said the abuse started when he was three years old and continued until he was a teenager.

Another woman said she was abused two or three times a week by Sena for more than a decade. 

Police described the abuse as 'one of the most horrific sex rings in memory'.

According to investigators Terrie Sena, told police she was attracted to young male and female teens, and said it was 'really enjoyable' when one of the boys started to look like Christopher Sena.

But she told authorities that she later felt 'ashamed' and 'dirty'.  

Deborah Sena told police that there was 'fear and intimidation' involved when it came to dealing with her husband Christopher Sena. The couple and Sena's ex-wife were arrested in December for sexual abuse of their children 

Christopher Sena also encouraged his abused children to bring their friends over to the house. 

He allegedly told one girl and one male victim to 'bring female friends over' and to make sure they wore bathing suits, according to the police report.

Another female victim, who is now an adult, said she saw Christopher Sena take 'a number of her friends' into his office, police said. 

Neighbors told the Review-Journal that he would seem 'excited' when his sons brought girlfriends over to the house.

Others described the Sena property as the place many neighborhood kids would hang out. Christopher Sena would erect a projector screen in the yard and hold movie nights, they said.

To stop his victims from speaking out about the abuse, he told at least two of them that he would kill them or break their legs if they spoke out, they told police.
