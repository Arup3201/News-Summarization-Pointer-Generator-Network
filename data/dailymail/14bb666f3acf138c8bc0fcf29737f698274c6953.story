A Cabinet minister’s proposal to allow shoppers to park for 15 minutes on double yellow lines has been dismissed by a Coalition junior minister as ‘dangerous and unworkable’.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, a Tory, suggested the scheme as a way to help ailing retailers.

But transport minister Norman Baker, whose Liberal Democrat colleagues actually want to increase parking charges, claimed the plan would increase congestion and drive people away.

Free for all: Motorists would not be hit with fines if they leave their car on double yellow lines for up to quarter of an hour

He said: ‘The idea of actually having 
cars parked for a very long period of time on a double yellow line 
undermines the purposes of the yellow line and I’m advised it’s 
unworkable. They are there for a reason, often for safety reasons.’

He added: ‘I’m not in favour of motorists who park illegally, blocking parking spaces for those who want to use them properly.’

But sources close to Mr Pickles argue 
that parking fines are doled out too eagerly, and are partly responsible
for killing off the high street.

Brandon Lewis, the Tory communities 
minister, said: ‘This Government has scrapped Whitehall rules that 
previously told councils to hike up parking charges, adopt draconian 
enforcement and impose arbitrary limits on off-street parking  spaces.

'Councils now need to play their part in reining back in the over-zealous culture of municipal parking enforcement.

‘They should adopt a common sense 
approach. Ministers are considering what further steps can be taken to 
ensure that town hall parking  policies and practices support local high
streets.’

Even Vince Cable, the Business 
Secretary, signalled his support for Mr Pickles, rather than his Lib 
Dem  colleague. He said he had ‘a lot of sympathy with what Eric Pickles
is trying to do’.

‘I think a lot of small businesses are
driven to distraction by over-zealous enforcement of the parking rules,
so  I think a little bit of common sense and flexibility is very much 
to be welcomed,’ he said.

Parking attendants would not issue fines to anyone nipping into a shop or leaving their car on double yellow lines for up to quarter of an hour

The Lib Dems want to lift the fines 
cap for illegal parking.

'Many double lines are there for historical reasons and could be lifted'

At present, it is set at a maximum of £70 
outside London and £130 in the capital.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Rather
than just allow drivers to park on double yellow lines, a thorough 
review of the lines would be more effective.

‘Many double lines are there for historical reasons and could be lifted.’
