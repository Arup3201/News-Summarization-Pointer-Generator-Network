Bayern Munich legend Franz Beckenbauer has raised concerns over the poor discipline of Franck Ribery and Jerome Boateng.  

Winger Ribery was criticised recently by Bayern head coach Pep Guardiola for his tendency to react angrily to on-field provocations, and Beckenbauer is worried that a failure to control his temper could end up costing his team. He is also worried that a similar risk exists with midfielder Boateng.

'Ribery is often dealt with pretty roughly. But that does not mean he can afford to lose his temper, even if he is often provoked,' Beckenbauer told Sky, 'People know that he often reacts. It's the same thing with Boateng.'

Bayern's honorary president went on to suggest that someone should 'talk to the players about this, because they are hurting the team,' before turning his attention to Guardiola's contract status. 

The Spaniard's deal at the Allianz Arena is set to expire next year and Beckenbauer spoke only in glowing terms of the man who delivered four trophies in his debut season in charge of the club, lifting the Bundesliga and German cup domestically as well as the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA World Club Cup. 

Beckenbauer said, 'Guardiola does not need a contract. He is the type of coach who comes and goes whenever he wants. Bayern would like to hold on to him for the remainder of his life and I hope he will stay put for a long time. It is a perfect fit. It does not get any better than this. Guardiola has been a major hit.

'With all due respect to Jupp Heynckes (Guardiola's predecessor), but Pep has brought a new philosophy to the club. He has found the perfect combination between Tiki-Taka and the traditional Bayern style.'

Guardiola's impressive CV, which also features three La Liga and two Champions League titles from his time with Barcelona, means that should he opt to leave Bayern, he will have no shortage of suitors.
