For more than 40 years, its fleet of nuclear submarines has been shrouded in mystery.

But now, China has unveiled the older generation of vessels, which can fire destructive rockets from under the sea.

The country disclosed the fleet - one of its most 
secretive military programs - for the first time in four decades as a sign of its growing strength and confidence.

In a ceremony yesterday, seamen performed a number of displays on the nuclear-armed submarines off the coast of Qingdao in east China's Shandong province.

They took part in safety drills, simulated military combat and carried out a series of training exercises.

They could also be seen transporting specialist equipment on the vessels, including China's Long March 2 nuclear submarine.

The country's PLA (People's Liberation Army) is devoting increasing resources to its naval forces to safeguard its maritime interests and assert its territorial claims.

However, the US has expressed concern over China's military developments - particularly since the country started operating within America's exclusive economic zone in June.

And earlier this year, a Chinese naval fleet was spotted sailing through an international strait between northern Japan and Russian's far east.Â 

The two missile destroyers, joined by three other vessels, sparked concern after passing through the Soya Strait, which separates the Sakhalin Islands in Russia from the island of Hokkaido in Japan.

At the time, local reports deemed it 'unclear' why the five-strong fleet was travelling through that particular area.
