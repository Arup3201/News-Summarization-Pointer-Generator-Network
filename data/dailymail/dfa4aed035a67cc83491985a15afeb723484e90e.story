With everyone from Lady Gaga to Cheryl Cole hopping on the buttock baring bandwagon, it was surely only a matter of time before the animal world got in on the act.

Now a collection of belfies [bottom selfies] featuring hamsters has gone viral after a selection of snaps was posted on website Rocket News 24.

Among the cute pictures are hamsters snapped slumped over their feed trough, burrowing behind an armchair and asleep on their owner's kitchen table.

Cute though they are, they can't muster quite enough buttock to rival the queen of the Belfie - reality star, Kim Kardashian.

After a photo of the new mother posing in a white swimsuit with her bottom on show went viral last month, a series of tributes have appeared - some more successful than others.

One of the most amusing was the tongue-in-cheek effort posted by model Kelly Brook who used Photoshop to inflate the size of her derriere to Kardashian like proportions.

Alongside the cheeky Instagram shot of the 33-year-old's newly-enlarged bottom, she wrote: '@kimkardashian I've seen that shot somewhere before HA!!'

The Kent-born beauty then posted a before and after comparison of the same snap, writing: 'Inspired @kimkardashian.'

The great escape: One of the furry creatures featured in the photos appears to be making a bid for freedom

Other celebrities to tackle the trend include Lady Gaga and Rihanna, both of whom have used social media to show off their derrieres, and TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh.

Another to give the world a peek at her rear end was Cheryl Cole, who also took the opportunity to unveil her now-healed bottom covering tattoo.

Unlike the others, who chose to imitate Kim Kardashian's side-on pose, the 30-year-old singer opted to turn her back on the camera completely, ensuring that all eyes were on her backside in the process - much like the stars of Rocket New's ultra cute hamster photos.
