A ship found off the coast of Cornwall could be a pirate vessel that sank more than 350 years ago.

Shipwreck hunter Todd Stevens believes the 80ft craft belonged to legendary privateer John Mucknell, known as the Pirate King of Scilly.

The John was originally a 44-gun East 
India Company frigate but its swashbuckling skipper Captain John 
Mucknell became a privateer just before the start of the civil war in 
1643.

Discovery: Tod Stevens holds one of the artefacts he found on what he believes is a 17th century pirate ship

He ran aground his ship, The John, in 1645, after it was damaged in a battle with sailors sent by Charles I. Since then, its exact location has remained a mystery.

He joined a fleet of smaller vessels based on the Scillies which raided ships in the Western Approaches and seized them and their cargoes.

Captain Mucknell was a staunch Royalist and his predations may have enjoyed semi official approval from Charles I, whose coffers would have been boosted by his loot.

He spent two years as a pirate until he was tracked down by three Parliamentary warships in 1645 and his ship was mauled in a naval battle close to the Scillies.

He then grounded it on a reef and 
escaped onto the islands along with most of his crew but the location of
 the wreck has remained a mystery which has baffled naval historians for
 years.

Captain Mucknell himself returned to 
the mainland where he was taken back into the mainstream Royalist Navy, 
knighted, and promoted to vice admiral.

He carried on fighting until the end of the Civil War in 1649 when he fled to Portugal.

Diver Todd Stevens is convinced that a
 large wreck he has located near the Scillies is the John. Artefacts 
recovered from the sea bed date it to the Civil War period.

The wreck is 80 foot long and too 
large to be one of the many small traders which foundered on the Isles 
at the time or one of the lesser pirate ships in the ten-strong fleet.

Experts are due to dive on the wreck 
in the next few weeks and it could receive protected status as an 
important underwater historical site if the identity is confirmed.

Mr Stevens has found a treasure trove of artefacts, including a thin silver coin imprinted during the reign of Charles I.

He said the story of The John and its colourful captain read like the script of a Hollywood blockbuster.

‘It’s like a movie - John Mucknell wasn’t even 50 when he died, but he lived an amazing life, any part of which would make a great film, but looked at together is almost unreal,’ he said.

Describing the find, Mr Stevens added: ‘I followed the lines in the sand and found there was more and more.

‘I was fighting the tide, but I could dig in with my hands to hold on.

‘I could tell it was a very big vessel, had been armed and from the construction technique that it was pre-1750.

‘But I could also tell it had been run aground because the bow was pointing into the land.’

Mr Stevens said: ‘There was already a rag tag bunch of pirates at Scilly, but Mucknell and his huge ship, the John, became the flagship, and all the pirates rallied under his banner.

‘There were about 11 ships in all, pillaging other ships, kidnapping people and conducting raids.

‘The Prince of Wales was petitioned about him and wrote to his father, the King.

‘Parliament was under pressure to act and in 1645 sent in the three ships to Scilly to stop this pirate.’

In the aftermath of the pitched battle, the damaged John was run aground by her captain, who then fled to Ireland.

Ironically, it seemed crime did pay for Captain Mucknell, whose support for the King won him a knighthood, a promotion to vice-admiral and the command of another ship.

He then returned to Scilly and, Mr Stevens claims ‘carried on where he left off’ up until the execution of Charles I in 1649, when he escaped to Portugal.

Alison James, maritime archaeologist with the organisation, said it could end up being Britain’s newest protected shipwreck site.

She said: ‘It is of interest because it is a very early vessel.

‘We know the John was a Royalist vessel and we know it was lost in 1645.

‘This is a preliminary investigation, but it could turn out to be of huge historical significance.’
