Referee Howard Webb is used to awarding penalties but has also shown that he can score them, too. 

The official, who took charge of the 2010 World Cup final, stepped up during a charity match at Oakwell, home of his local club, Barnsley. 

And Webb showed his typical calmness under pressure, opting for a cheeky Panenka effort similar to the one Andrea Pirlo pulled off against England in Euro 2012.

The Premier League official beats the diving goalkeeper before wheeling away in celebration with his team-mates.

The footage of Webb's superb effort has just emerged, despite the match having taken place in 2012. 

Maybe Roy Hodgson should get Webb in to show England's top players how it is done ahead of the Euro 2016 qualification group games.
