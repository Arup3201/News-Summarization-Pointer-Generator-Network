Killer: Jordan Graham, 22, should get life in prison for pushing her husband of eight days Cody Johnson off a cliff during an argument, prosecutors say

A young bride who pushed her new husband off a cliff eight days after they were wed should be jailed for life, prosecutors have demanded.

Jordan Graham, 22, admitted shoving her 25-year-old husband Cody Johnson to his death from a precipice at the Glacier National Park, Montana, during an argument.

His battered body was only found at the bottom of a ravine after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker.

At her trial in December, Graham entered a guilty plea to second-degree murder in exchange for waiving charges of first-degree murder and lying to investigators.

First-degree murder means the crime is premeditated.

A sentencing hearing is set for March 27 before U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy in Missoula. Graham's attorney said the 'extremely reckless but unintentional act' merits 10 years in prison.

Graham said at her trial that she was having second thoughts about getting married so young and that she and her husband had gone to the park on July 7 to talk about it.

They argued heatedly at the edge of a steep cliff, she told the court. When Mr Johnson grabbed her by the arm, she became angry and she 'just pushed' without thinking about where they were, Graham said.

She didn't tell anybody what had happened, instead making up a story that Johnson had gone for a 'joyride' with friends from Washington state.

That story unraveled when the versions she told to friends, relatives and authorities didn't match.

'Dangerous, predatory and unrepentant': Assistant U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus said Graham showed no remorse, left Mr Johnson's mother without a child, upended a community and had no respect for the law

In court filings yesterday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus asked Judge Molloy to impose a life sentence or else no less than 50 years in prison.

Graham showed no remorse, left Mr Johnson's mother without a child, upended a community and had no respect for the law in the process, Mr Baucus argued.

'Through her actions, including the murder of Cody and conduct that followed, the defendant has demonstrated that she is extremely dangerous, predatory and an unrepentant murderer,' he wrote.

Federal public defender Michael Donahoe said in his recommendation for a 10-year sentence that Graham ultimately accepted responsibility and is sorry she didn't come forward sooner.

She did not obstruct the investigation, and her fabrication of an email designed to support her story that Johnson had driven away was 'the emerging cry of defendant's conscience,' Mr Donahoe said, noting that Graham was the one who led authorities to Johnson's body.

If Graham 'was a cold-blooded killer, she could have left Mr Johnson at the bottom of that ravine. He would have likely never been found,' Mr Donahoe wrote.
