Reports of breast implants bursting in Britain have risen more than fivefold in three years, it was revealed today.

More than 1,500 cases of ruptured implants were reported in 2012/2013, compared to just 293 in 2009/2010 - with one expert putting the problem partly down to the ‘Jordan syndrome’.

Plastic surgeon Douglas McGeorge said many women are insisting on outsize breasts to copy glamour model Katie Price, who became known for her surgically-enhanced chest.

Jordan: One plastic surgeon said many women are insisting on outsize breasts to copy glamour model Katie Price, who became known for her surgically-enhanced chest. She is pictured left in 2005 and right in 2011

Model: Jordan (left in 2004, and right in 2008) had her first breast implants aged just 18 when she went from a 32B to a 32D - and has since gone on to spend thousands on her cleavage in a total of six operations

Mr McGeorge, former president of the British Association for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, told The Sun: ‘There is "Jordan syndrome" where some women want bigger and bigger breasts.

‘The bigger they are, the more problems that are likely to occur. Large implants are influenced by gravity. Just as a bag containing a goldfish ripples when you lift it, large implants can ripple.’

Speaking to journalists Nick McDermott and Christina Earle, Mr McGeorge also told of 'problems in recent years where some cheaper implants were not up to standard and were prone to failure’.

Problems reported in the past few years follow revelations that French firm Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) had been manufacturing implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses.

Almost 50,000 women in the UK, and some 400,000 worldwide, were affected by the scandal - which came to light after doctors found unexpectedly high numbers of implants were rupturing.

Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of Poly Implant Prothese, was jailed for four years last year for fraud.

Changes: Katie Price's fourth breast implant operation in Los Angeles took her to 32GG, which led to her decision in 2007, after meeting first husband Peter Andre (pictured together), to have a breast reduction

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency received 2,427 reports of problems with fake breasts in 2012 and 2013, with 1,543 of these relating to ruptures.

The Department of Health executive agency said some 30,000 breast implant operations are carried out each year and ‘the vast majority of women do not experience any problems’.

Miss Price had her first breast implants aged just 18 when she went from a 32B to a 32D - and has since gone on to spend thousands on her cleavage in a total of six operations.

Her fourth operation in Los Angeles took her to 32GG, which led to her decision in 2007, after meeting first husband Peter Andre, to have a breast reduction. 

She hoped to reduce her bust from a 32G to 32C, but was left with a 32F cup and was unhappy with the results, which she felt she left her breasts too far apart. She then underwent further surgery to rectify it. In total, Miss Price has spent more than £100,000 on plastic surgery.
