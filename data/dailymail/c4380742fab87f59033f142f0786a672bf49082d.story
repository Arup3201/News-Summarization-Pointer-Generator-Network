As the hype intensifies around the latest Star Wars movie, director J.J. Abrams has announced an opportunity for one lucky person - and a friend - to appear in the saga’s next adventure.

The director, who is currently filming in Abu Dhabi, appeared in a specially recorded film which was unveiled on Good Morning America on Wednesday.

The competition is part of an initiative called Star Wars: Force For Change that will raise funds and awareness for the United Nations Children's Fund's (UNICEF) Innovation Labs project to help benefit the world's most vulnerable children.

The video starts with Abrams talking about how excited he is to be making the movie before explaining what the winner can expect to receive.

The competition offers one lucky person - and a friend - the opportunity to visit Pinewood Studios in London and visit the set as Abrams' VIP guests.

They will have the opportunity to meet members of the cast and will be transformed by the film's makeup and costume teams, most likely into alien extras, and will appear in a scene.

As Abrams explains how the competition works, fans get a special glimpse at a new creature who may be appearing in the movie.

The force is strong in this one: J.J. Abrams begins filming for Star Wars Episode VII in Abu Dhabi

First time: J.J. has never shot a movie outside of the US

'We're 
even more excited that by participating in this campaign, Star Wars fans
 will be helping children around the world through our collaboration 
with UNICEF Innovation Labs and projects.'

Also on Wednesday, the United Arab Emirates finally acknowledged that it is standing in for one corner of George Lucas' galaxy far, far away.

Abu
 Dhabi's government-backed twofour54 media hub confirmed that the next 
installment of Star Wars is currently filming in the Middle Eastern 
emirate. It was the first official word from the Gulf nation that 
filming had begun.

Emirati officials previously had refused to confirm or comment on filming, despite Abram’s production company, Bad Robot, tweeting the news last Friday.

Using the hashtag ‘#dayone’, a picture of the first film clapperboard was shared for the internet to go wild about.

Taking the production to Abu Dhabi marks a move away from the original desert locations used in the first six Star Wars installments.

For Episodes I-VI, various spots in Tunisia were used the most to film sandy scenes, including the region of Tatooine, which George Lucas decided to name Luke Skywalker's home planet after.

Additional footage was later shot in the Death Valley National Park.

Cast: The line-up for the new film was announced on Twitter with a picture of all the actors, old and new, reading through the script with J.J.

At the 
Tunisian government's request, the set for Anakin Skywalker's (Darth 
Vader) hometown in the Tatooine desert, Mos Espa, stil remains in the 
Sahara desert.

Now
 in Abu Dhabi, a ‘whole world’ has reportedly been built in one of its 
salt lakes, according to local media outlet The National.

A ‘shuttle-like’ craft as well as several jet-powered buggies have also been spotted in the area not to mention a ‘large tower’ and a ‘big, centuries-old-looking market’.

Images obtained by Abu Dhabi's The National show a giant marquee with crew members wheeling bits of set and props in and out ahead of the first day of production.

It will soon move to a studio far, far away as the majority of the movie will be filmed at Pinewood, where the newly announced cast first got together to read through the script.

Props: The National reports that jet-powered buggies have been spotted in the filming location in Abu Dhabi, which could be similar to these speedy vehicles ridden by Leia and Luke in the earlier films

Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher 
(Princess Leia), Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Anthony Daniels (C3PO), 
Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) and Kenny Baker (R2-D2) have returned to the 
franchise, but Abrams has still made room for some fresh faces.

British actors John Boyega (Attack The Block) and Daisy Ridley (Mr. Selfridge) join Adam Driver (Girls), Oscar Isaac (Inside Llewyn Davis) and Dohmnall Gleeson (Frank) in the film.

Performance capture king Andy Serkis will bring his precious talent to a number of roles and veteran screen actor Max von Sydow (The Exorcist) has also signed on.

Abrams previously said: ‘We are so excited to finally share the cast of Star Wars: Episode VII.

Before: The planet Tatooine was brought to life in Tunisia for the first six instalments

‘It is both thrilling and surreal to watch the beloved original cast and these brilliant new performers come together to bring this world to life, once again. We start shooting in a couple of weeks, and everyone is doing their best to make the fans proud.’

It is the first time the Emmy Award-winning director has shot a movie outside of the US, having already cemented his name along some directing greats after helming the blockbuster reboot of Star Trek.

Star Wars Episode VII, which has a screenplay written by the director and Lawrence Kasban, opens worldwide on December 18, 2015.
