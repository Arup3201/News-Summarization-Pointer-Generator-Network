A schoolboy who beat leukaemia twice died after contracting a lung infection from dust caused by building work at Birmingham Children’s Hospital.

Jamie Cartwright, nine, died after the dust caused him to contract a lung infection, which lead to abscesses and finally a brain haemorrhage.

At an inquest today, the hospital was today criticised for failing to protect ‘vulnerable’ patients.

Jamie Cartwright, nine, caught a fungal lung infection after breathing in dust from building work. The infection spread through his body, causing brain abscesses and eventually a haemorrage which killed him

Recording a narrative verdict Coroner Louise Hunt said: 'He contracted the infection from building work which was being undertaken near to the ward and outpatients clinic, where he was being treated.

'There was a failure to consult the department where patients were particularly at risk and a failure to undertake a risk assessment or act to minimise the risk. These failures contributed to Jamie’s death.'

Aspergillosis is a lung infection caused by spores from the aspergillus fungus.

In a healthy person, the spores will be quickly destroyed by the immune system but in someone with weak lungs, or a compromised immune system - such as Jamie - it can spread.

Symptoms can range from a cough, which is often occurs in asthma sufferers, to coughing up blood or even death.

The most serious kind of Aspergillosis, which usually occurs in patients who have had chemotherapy, is invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

This infection can spread through the body to the heart, eyes, lungs and kidneys, where it becomes fatal.

Jamie's devastated family issued a statement after the hearing, saying: 'We are pleased with the narrative verdict which acknowledges that the Trust’s failure contributed to Jamie’s death and that the Trust has taken action to improve the system for dealing with building work at the hospital.

'We hope that the steps are far reaching and properly adhered to in order to prevent vulnerable immuno-compromised children from being treated in an unsafe environment in the future.'

The inquest heard that the pupil from Little Bloxwich Primary school was diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia in 2006, and went into remission after being given chemotherapy treatment.

But he suffered a relapse in December 2012 and in March last year underwent a bone marrow stem cell transplant using his older brother, Aaron, as a donor.

Jamie suffered complications and went back to the hospital on a number of occasions in June and July after the building work had started at the Accident and Emergency Department.

His mother Vicki Cartwright had said she had noticed dust in corridors but when she raised concerns had been reassured that there was no danger.

Dr Jim Grey, a microbiologist at the hospital, said there had been no prior consultation with the oncology department about the works.

He said that on a scale of one to 10 the seriousness of the failure to do this was 10.

Jamie was found to have the life-threatening Aspergillosis lung infection following a chest X-ray and CT scan and was admitted to intensive care. But despite treatment he died on August 7.

After the inquest a spokesperson from Birmingham Children’s Hospital said: 'Everyone at the hospital is devastated by the death of Jamie.

'When any child passes away at our hospital, we always examine their care to see if there is anything we could have done to prevent it.

'In Jamie’s case, we recognise that there is a possibility that he could have been exposed to the aspergillus spores.

'I totally understand why Jamie’s family feel that we let them down, but hope they can take some small comfort from the fact we have taken every step possible to learn from our involvement in Jamie’s care and his tragic death.'
