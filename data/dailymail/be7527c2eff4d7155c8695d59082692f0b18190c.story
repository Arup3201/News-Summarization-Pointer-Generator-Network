An animal lover nicknamed 'Kangaroo Dundee' is set to star in a BBC star documentary that follows his life in the Australian Outback mothering orphaned marsupials.

Chris Barnes gave up life in the city to build a shack with no running water or boiler, where he cares for the animals.

The 6ft 7" Australian, nicknamed Brolga, cares for the babies 24 hours-a-day, taking them to the supermarket in nearby Alice Springs and even letting them sleep at the end of his bed.

Mother: The BBC film follows Brolga - an aboriginal word for stork - taking on three newly-orphaned and vulnerable babies: Amy, Daisy and William

His amazing story has been documented in a two-part BBC2 series Kangaroo Dundee.

The film shows Brolga - an aboriginal 
word for stork - taking on three newly-orphaned and vulnerable babies: 
Amy, Daisy and William.

He has to care for the young marsupials as if he is their real mother, feeding them every four hours without fail.

Mr Barnes said: 'I live in a shed with no
boiler or running water but the most important thing is my kangaroos 
and making sure they're safe.

'To
live out here and be part of the outback is all that is important to 
me. Just because I'm a man, some people call me a kangaroo dad. I'm not.
I'm a kangaroo mum.

'The first thing a kangaroo mother does is care for her joey. Without their mother, joeys are incredible vulnerable.

'I find, as a carer, that we I have a much better success rate if I give the babies lots of love.'

Mr Barnes, who is in his 40s, started his
new life 20 years ago after rescuing three joeys and realising they 
couldn't go back to the wild.

He built his own sanctuary in the Outback, single-handedly digging a 
2.5 mile long trench and fixing more than 4,000 metres of chain-mesh to 
450 hand-hammered fence posts.

He said: 'I'm not a rich man, I never have been so I decided to try and raise a bit of money stacking shelves and washing buses.

'I spent two-and-a-half years working seven days a week to build the sanctuary in 45 degree heat.

'I live in a shed with no boiler or running water but the most important thing is my kangaroos and making sure they're safe.

'To live out here and be part of the outback is all that is important to me.'

Carer: Mr Barnes describes himself as a 'kangaroo mum', having looked after around 200 of the animals

Brolga's life revolves around the 
orphans' needs, waking up in the middle of the night to tend to crying 
babies.

He also has to patrol the perimeter of the sanctuary, making sure the animals are safe from wild dogs.

But
the biggest threat posed to Brolga and his mob is from the weather.

He
added: 'A bushfire is the closest thing to hell. If it got into the 
sanctuary it would be all over, the kangaroos would be burned alive - it
would be the worst thing I could imagine.

'If
one day that uncontrollable demon of a bushfire comes to the sanctuary I
will take it on to protect my family and I will go down fighting.'

Babies: When the animals are young, Mr Barnes keeps them at the foot of his bed, often having to tend to them through the night when they cry

No kicking: He said the biggest threat to his kangaroo sanctuary is the threat of a bushfire, describing them as 'the closest thing to hell'
