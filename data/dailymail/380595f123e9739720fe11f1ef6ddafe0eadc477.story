Meet Freya, Lily and Eleanor - the identical triplets who have beaten medical odds and are now a picture of health.

The sisters were born premature in April at just 28 weeks and spent seven weeks in hospital, but are now home with their parents Jessica and Liam Posselwhite from Guisborough, North Yorkshire.

The odds of having triplets are around 4,000 to one - with around one in six of all sets of triplets being identical.

Doctors had warned mum Jessica of the likelihood of a miscarriage, and of the high chance of them being born with Down’s Syndrome, heart defects or other health problems.

But the Guisborough trio are all thriving and become the fifth generation of their family, welcomed by great great grandmother Mabel Gildroy, 96.

Proud mum Jessica, 25, a youth support worker, said, 'It was overwhelming at first, when we found out. The initial scans were not very good and we were warned that I could miscarry at any time.

'We were stressed, and incredibly upset but we kept going.

'I had a steroid injection the week before they were born, and I am sure that meant they were stronger - they didn’t even need a ventilator.

'Looking at what we have now is incredible. They’re three little miracles.'

Dad Liam, also 25, a teaching assistant at Kilton Thorpe School, in Brotton, said, 'It was emotionally draining, the constant worry and the trips for scans and specialists. We’ve had wonderful support from our family, friends, and at work, and the girls are worth all of the drama. Sometimes we find ourselves just standing and staring at them.'

The pair met at Laurence Jackson School in Guisborough and, at 15, fell in love. They went on to do the same course at Teesside University before marrying, and then finding out they were expecting triplets.

While the new family is loving life at home, there are a few practical issues.

'We had to buy a new car, and I only got a new one last September,' said Jessica. 'We’ve got a three-seater pram and it won’t fit in, so that goes on the roof rack.

'But everything at Boot’s is three-for-two, so that’s a bonus!'

Liam continued, 'We manage to feed two at a time, and we’re rocking the bouncer chair with our feet while the other one waits for a bottle.

'When we’re having tea, we’ve got our plates on our knee and trying to keep them amused.

'If one starts crying, it can set the others off, so we end up walking around the house on tip-toes. But they sleep quite well, and we are loving it.'

But one thing Liam and Jessica won’t be doing is buying them matching outfits.

Jessica said: 'We want them to be individuals. Obviously, they’re going to have an incredible bond, and that’s something we’re very excited about. But we’ll be teaching them to be their own people.'

There are five generations of Jessica’s family - from the triplets, to grandmother Debbie Rutter, 52, nana Vera Rutter, 74, and great grandmother Mabel - who becomes great great grandmother.

Mabel said: 'I never thought I would live to see my great great grandchildren. They are absolutely beautiful, I am overjoyed.'

The triplets’ nana, Debbie, said: 'I am just so proud of them. It was terrifying when we had to go for appointments, and up to the hospital in Newcastle.

'It’s hard to believe just how perfect they are.'
