Birmingham businesswomen Ranjit Uppelle, 41, left, and Kavita Jnagal, 37, admitted conspiracy to defraud at Southwark Crown Court

They rubbed shoulders with the stars, chatted to the Chancellor and even shook hands with the Queen at Buckingham Palace – all the while being praised for helping people find work.

But unknown to those they mingled with, businesswomen Ranjit Uppelle and Kavita Jnagal had been busy masterminding a sophisticated scam which saw them steal £200,000 of taxpayers’ money.

The pair co-founded Simply Recruitment in 2008 – a company that claimed to ‘help adult learners improve their job chances’. This led to them being awarded the Outstanding Women in Business of the Year award.

They relied on their carefully constructed veneer of respectability as they hobnobbed with the likes of Prince Charles and former Dragons’ Den tycoon James Caan. Their success led to them meeting the Queen at an Asian Women of Achievement reception held at Buckingham Palace, and at other prestigious events they mingled with Gordon Brown, George Osborne and David Cameron.

But it has now emerged that the pair’s astonishing rise to success was built on a complex scam which involved taking money from the Government-funded quango, Learndirect.

A court heard Uppelle, 41 and Jnagal, 37, recruited an army of ‘ghost students’ to pose as clients in order to acquire large amounts of funding.

Investigators believe they claimed the money by charging Learndirect for fraudulent training courses, most of which took place between March and November 2010.

The pair used company employees to fake student enrolment and exam result records in adult education packages.

Their staff were told to sit the exams and then doctor the results in order to secure funding from the Government.

Employees were coerced into forging the signatures of fake students to add extra weight to the fraud. Hundreds of real students are also thought to have been enrolled without their knowledge, and work was faked for students who signed up to courses but later pulled out.

Other results were doctored to make it appear that students who failed the tests had actually passed their exams.

Uppelle, from Edgbaston in Birmingham and Jnagal, from Rugeley, near Lichfield, both admitted conspiracy to defraud at Southwark Crown Court. They were handed suspended jail terms of nine and six months respectively and ordered to pay £1,000 costs.

Uppelle and Jnagal entered their pleas last August, but they can only now be reported after the scam’s ringleader, Sandeep Jethwa, admitted the same charge in January.

He swindled at least £120,000 from the charity University for Industry by creating ghost students, – but was caught when the Metropolitan Police’s fraud squad was alerted to concerns over an unusual number of high-level passes in February 2011.

Jethwa, 43, from Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, was jailed for a year and has already had to repay £120,000.

Detective Constable Mo Khan said: ‘Instead of helping provide adults with the skills to improve their employability, they devoted time to faking training.

‘Their conspiracy undermined the entire project as well undermining their contractual obligation to Learndirect.’

Learndirect spokesman Adrian Beddow said: ‘We are pleased with the outcome of this case.

‘We identified this fraudulent behaviour and undertook a full investigation, working to bring a strong case which led to the guilty pleas of all involved.

‘We do not tolerate behaviour of this kind from our suppliers. These sentences should serve as a warning that the protection of public funds is of paramount importance to us.’
