Manchester United have named an unchanged line-up for the first time since November 2012 as they take on Tottenham in the Premier League.

Louis van Gaal has rotated his squad regularly this season, using 31 players in their 18 league matches alone since August.

But the Dutchman has stuck to the same line-up that defeated Newcastle United 3-1 at Old Trafford on Boxing Day, despite complaining about playing less than 48 hours later.

The last time this occurred was 85 matches ago when Sir Alex Ferguson stuck to the same team for a home match with Arsenal on November 3, 2012, a week after they won 3-2 at Chelsea.

Van Gaal said on BT Sport ahead of kick-off: 'It's unbelievable. I hope it's enough time to recover. I have players on the bench who miss match rhythm, so we cannot chance.' 

There are seven players in Sunday's line-up at White Hart Lane who were involved in those fixtures over two years ago - David De Gea, Jonny Evans, Antonio Valencia, Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney, Ashley Young and Robin van Persie.

United are hoping to extend their recent record to eight wins in nine matches and strengthen their grip on third place in the table.

They currently trail leaders Chelsea by 10 points and second-placed Manchester City by seven points.
