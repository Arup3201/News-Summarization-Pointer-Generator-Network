A prominent Melbourne racing identity has been reportedly caught out making a revealing remark about billionaire James Packer's views about the Victorian state election. 

A Channel 10 microphone this morning captured former Crown Casino chief Lloyd Williams telling Daniel Andrews, the Victorian opposition leader, that Packer will 'kick every goal he can' for him.

Ten News reporter David Woiwod tweeted a short transcript of the  recording. 

According to Woiwod's account, Mr Williams was heard saying: 'I am on the executive of the Packer estate, and James is going to kick every goal he can for you.'

At a doorstop press conference later, Mr Andrews said he would let other people interpret Mr Williams' remarks.

The incumbent Coalition parties are lagging behind Labor in the polls.  

A Newspoll survey released on Monday found Labor was ahead 54 to 46 on a two party preferred basis.

Mr Packer has not yet commented on Mr Williams' controversial remark

Daily Mail Australia has approached Mr Packer's spokeswoman for comment. An aide to Lloyd Williams said: 'Mr Williams doesn't talk to the press.' 

The Victorian state election campaign began in earnest on Monday. 

Premier Denis Napthine delivered the electoral writs to the state governor Alex Chernov, starting the countdown to a November 29 poll.  

Mr Williams' remark could be indicative of big business swinging its support behind Mr Andrews, The Australian reported.
