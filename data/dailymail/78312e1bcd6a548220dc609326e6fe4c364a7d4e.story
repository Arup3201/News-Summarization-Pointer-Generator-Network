To most of us they are vermin that deserve to be shot on sight.

But thanks to a training programme paid for by the British taxpayer rats are helping to clear mines in Africa and save lives.

The Department for International Development is funding a £60,000 nine-month training programme for the three foot long Gambian species to sniff out the deadly concealed weapons.

The giant rodents are light enough to walk over the mines without setting them off and have been dubbed 'Herorats'.

Once trained, each rat can search daily an area 14 times larger than that covered by a human mine clearer at a fraction of the cost.

So far nearly 2,500 mines as well as more than 14,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance, small arms and ammunition in Mozambique  - which were left over the country's 1990s civil war  - have been detected thanks to the animal's keen sense of smell and intelligence.

Although it has poor sight, the giant Gambian rat it is highly intelligent and has an exceptional sense of smell and lives up to eight years, according to the mine clearance charity Apopo, which runs the training scheme.

'British funding has helped to destroy thousands of mines across Mozambique. This not only saves lives but frees up valuable, fertile land on which to grow crops and contribute to the economy,' said International Development Secretary Justine Greening.
