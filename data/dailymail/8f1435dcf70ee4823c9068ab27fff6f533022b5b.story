A father and daughter shared a terrifying moment when a whale nearly capsized their boat during a canoeing expedition.

The pair were in a small boat off Fraser Island, Queensland, Australia, when the giant mammal approached.

The girl can be heard panicing in a video clip as the whale advances towards the boat and nearly tips over the canoe.

Horrifying: The father and daughter shared a terrifying moment during a canoeing expedition

A short clip posted online on Nine News shows the girl was paddling off  the
southern coast with her father in September when they came across two 
whales.

'Oh my God dad, it's going under, ' the girl said as the whale lurches towards their tiny canoe.

The fear and excitement can be heard in the girl's voice as it edges nearer and lifts its giant head above the surface of the water.

'Dad is he gonna hit us?," she said. 'Oh my God!'

During the video her father can not be heard responding - presumably he is holding his breath holding the boat will not be submerged.

After swimming around the scared pair for a little while the massive animal then looks like it loses interest and stops baiting the terrified pair.
