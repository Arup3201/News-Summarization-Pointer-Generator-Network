A man has been jailed for helping a murderer to try and flee the country after he killed two teenage girls in horrific knife attacks.

Steven Harratt, 57, gave Ahmad Otak money, clothing, food and a sat-nav so he could drive to  Dover where he could get a ferry to France after he murdered 17-year-old Kimberley Frank and 18-year-old Samantha Sykes.

Ahmad Otak has been jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 34 years in prison after he stabbed his 19-year-old girlfriend Elisa Frank’s younger sister Kimberley to death in a flat March last year.

The murderer then forced his girlfriend to lure 18-year-old Samantha Sykes to the flat in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, where he stabbed her.

A court heard Otak then asked for Harratt's help, saying he 'had a problem' but didn't tell him about the murders. It was then that Harratt provided Otak with money, food and the sat-nav to make the trip to Dover.

The court was told that Harratt saw Otak was brandishing a knife and had bound Elisa's feet together before driving off with her in his car. 

Steven Harratt, 57, denied assisting the offender but was found guilty by a jury at Leeds Crown Court last month and was today jailed for two years and nine months.

Judge Geoffrey Marson QC told him: 'I sentence you on the basis, as the jury must have found, that you believed [Otak] had committed at least one serious offence of violence.

'I’m satisfied from the evidence I have heard that you knew it was particularly serious because you know at one stage that Elisa Frank had her legs bound and that Mr Otak had on his knee a knife.'

The judge described: 'In March last year Ahmad Otak murdered the sister of his then girlfriend. He did that in his then girlfriend’s presence. He then forced Elisa Frank to lure her friend and again in her presence murdered the friend.

'The evidence clearly shows that after, he had determined to flee the country in an effort to avoid arrest.

'He took Elisa Frank against her will, binding her and carrying with him a knife, and they drove to your house.

'The prosecution do not allege and I do not sentence you on the basis that you know that Ahmad Otak had committed two murders.

'Had you know of the murders the sentence would have been significantly longer.

'I sentenced you on the basis, as the 
jury must have found, that you believed he had committed at least a 
serious offence of violence.

'You provided him with food, with money, clothing and you went out and bought him a satellite navigation device.

'You gave him some advice, I’m satisfied, as to the method by which he might flee the country on a ferry.

'Once he had left your house there was some contact between you.'

During the course of the four-day trial, the jury heard distressing evidence from Elisa, who told how she watched Otak spit on her sister Kimberley’s body before making her lure friend Samantha to the flat - and brutally knifing her as well.

After the case, Detective Chief Inspector Simon Atkinson, who led the enquiry to convict Otak and Harratt, said: 'We welcome the sentence of Steven Harratt today.

'Clearly the court have concluded that he assisted Ahmad Otak following the murder of Kimberley Frank and Sammy Sykes and in in doing so aided him in both escaping from West Yorkshire and evading the police.

'Fortunately however we were able to apprehend Otak before he managed to flee the country to make him answer for truly brutal and horrific crimes.

'I know the pain and suffering the families of Kimberley and Sammy have endured has been immense but I hope the conviction of Harratt today will at least bring them some closure now that the legal process has concluded.'
