Prince Harry made his first visit to a mosque today on the final day of his whirlwind tour of Oman.

The fourth in line to the throne was visiting the breath-taking Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in the capital Muscat, which can accommodate up to 20,000 worshippers at any one time.

Dressed in a smart blue suit, Harry slipped off his shoes in accordance with religious custom as he was given a tour of the spectacular marble-floored complex by a member of the Diwan – or Royal Court - Higher Centre for Culture and Science.

In accordance with religious tradition, he slipped off his shoes for the tour. The Mosque was a gift to the nation of Oman from its ruler, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, to mark the 30th year of his reig

The prince looked fascinated as he was talked through the history of the mosque and the mammoth effort that it took to build it.

The Mosque was a gift to the nation of Oman from its ruler, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, to mark the 30th year of his reign. 

Built from 300,000 tonnes of Indian sandstone, the main musalla – or prayer hall - has a central dome rising to a height of 164 feet (50 metres) above the floor.

Its main minaret, which rises 295 feet (90 metres) and four flanking towers, can be seen across the city. The mosque also boasts the world's second largest hand-woven carpet and chandelier.

The main musalla or prayer room has a dome that rises an impressive 300m into the air

The enormous prayer carpet measures 229ft by 196ft and weighs 21 tonnes. It took four years to produce

The prayer carpet measures 229 feet by 196 feet and covers the entire floor of the main hall.

It is remarkable not only because it is is made from a single piece of cloth but because it contains 1.7 billion knots, weighs 21 tonnes and took 400 female weavers four years to produce.

Its weavers incorporated 28 different colours in a variety of shades, the majority obtained from traditional vegetable dyes.

The building's majestic Swarovski crystal chandelier, which hangs above the praying hall, is equally impressive.

It is a staggering 45 feet tall, weighs eight tonnes and has 1122 lights inside that take two days to change, twice a year.

In all, it took six years to complete the 416,000 square metre site, which opened to the public in 2001.

Harry peppered his guide with questions throughout the half-hour long tour and smiled at pictures of his father, Prince Charles, on a visit to the mosque last year that had been displayed in its library.

Harry's visit caused great excitement among a group of American tourists who were also visiting

His visit, which was unannounced, caused waves of excitement among a group of American tourists who happened to be there, while a group of schoolchildren squealed with delight each time he walked past and jumped in front of the prince to pose for spur-of-the-moment selfies.

Walking out through the spacious gardens bisected by water channels, Harry thanked his guide and headed straight off in his convoy to the international airport to fly onto Abu Dhabi.

This afternoon he will play in the Sentebale Polo Cup at Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club attended by celebrities including Geri Halliwell and Dan Stevens. 

The match is in aid of the charity he set up in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, following a gap year visit to the tiny southern African kingdom of Lesotho. The name Sentebale means 'forget me not' in the local dialect, Basotho.

The trip to the mosque was the final stop on Harry's tour of Oman and he will now fly to Abu Dhabi

The magnificent mosque is one of Muscat - and Oman's - top tourist destinations

Lesotho is a tiny, poverty-stricken country with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world. Sentebale supports the many thousands of children affected by the epidemic both directly and though losing their families to the disease.

Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV.

The Sentebale Cup, which is in its fifth year, is helping to support the Mamohato Programme, which address the emotional and psychological needs of children living with HIV as well as working to reduce the stigma linked to the disease and helping to markedly improve their quality of life. 

Harry, who plans to make a visit to some of the charity's project next month, has said he hopes to expand its work to other countries in Africa.

Harry plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately after the official elements of the trip have concluded today to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit, which is on this weekend. For more details on the Sentebale Cup see www.sentebale.org
