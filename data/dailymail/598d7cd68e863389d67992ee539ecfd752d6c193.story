Amanda Knox has chopped off her hair ahead of the verdict in the latest round of appeals in the case of her roommate's murder.

The 26-year-old American was spotted leaving a downtown Seattle salon on Wednesday with a dramatically different look.

She had her brown hair cut into a tight bob, with longest the tips falling above her chin.Shortly after leaving the salon she covered her newly-shorn look with a turquoise beret.

New do: Amanda Knox, 26, was spotted leaving a Seattle hair salon with her hair chopped into a bob

Changes: While she was once derided for her glamorous looks, it is clear from the no-nonsense haircut and glasses that Knox is trying to adapt to being back to a low-key life in Seattle

The new hairstyle comes in clear contrast to the hairstyle she has had for the past six years when the world was first introduced to her following the murder of her roommate Meredith Kercher, who she lived with while studying abroad in Perugia, Italy in 2007.

Her hair used to fall past her shoulder, but when she walked out of the downtown branch of Gene Juarez salons on Wednesday, her hair was up to six inches shorter.

Haircuts at the salon, which boasts of being 'a slice of heaven', start at $50 and prices range depending on the experience level of the stylist.

The salon is not far from Knox's apartment in the International District of the city, but she may need some time to adjust to the new look as she quickly put on a hat once she left the salon.

Some getting used to: Knox quickly covered up with a knit cap though it did not appear to be for warmth as she kept her brown leather coat open and chest bare without a scarf

Dressed casually in faded jeans, blue clogs a striped sweater and brown leather jacket, it was clear that Knox was trying to blend into her new low-key life in Seattle.

She looked like ever-the-student, wearing glasses and toting a large bag, that could have been headed to do work for her University of Washington classes that she enrolled in after returning to the U.S. in the spring of last year.

It has been a tense few weeks for Knox and she will surely be waiting on pins and needles until the verdict is handed down later this week about the latest round of appeals that the Kercher trial has gone through.

Whatever is decided this week, the protracted legal battle that has grabbed global headlines and polarized trial-watchers in three nations probably won't end in Florence.

The first two trials produced flip-flop verdicts of guilty then innocent for Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, and the case has produced harshly clashing versions of events.

A Florence appeals panel designated by Italy's supreme court to address issues it raised about the acquittal is set to deliberate Thursday, with a verdict expected later in the day.

Much of the attention has focused on Knox, 26, who has remained in Seattle during this trial, citing her fear of 'the universal problem of wrongful conviction,' according to her statement emailed to the Florence court.

Her representatives say she is concentrating on her studies at the University of Washington.

Return: Knox returned to the U.S. in March 2013 after her verdict was overturned, and now she may be sentenced again if the Italian court finds her guilty in the latest appeals case going on now

'We wait for the verdict, and remain hopeful,' Knox's U.S. lawyer, Theodore Simon, said by telephone from Philadelphia.

'But history being our guide, we know Amanda can be convicted and it is very disconcerting to her and her family. The logical position is that there is no evidence.'

Knox was arrested four days after Kercher's half-naked body was discovered November 2, 2007 in the Briton's bedroom in the university town of Perugia.

Knox has been portrayed both as a she-devil bent on sexual adventure and as a naif caught up in Italy's Byzantine justice system.
