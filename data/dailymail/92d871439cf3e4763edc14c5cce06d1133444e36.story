Armed robber Joey Kadmiri, who was hospitalised after members of Australia's dancing troupe, Thunder from Down Under, discovered him backstage at their show in Las Vegas.

A Las Vegas man who stands accused of stealing G-strings from a touring Australian stripper show and shooting a revolver at the troupe has been found mentally capable to stand trial.

Joey Kadmiri, 25,faces charges of robbery with a weapon, burglary and battery charges in the Las Vegas District Court, after he allegedly broke into the Las Vegas hotel room of the head stripper of Australia's Thunder from Down Under troupe, Mathew Fardel.

Kadmiri's lawyer said the man had drug and mental health issues before the March 18 incident, but two doctors have found him fit to stand trial.

The competency hearing was called after Kadmiri appeared in court on September 2, and labelled the prosecutors Beavis and Butthead.

Kadmiri claimed his former lawyer had worked to convict him and then announced, 'I'm really paranoid'.

The 25-year-old is accused of firing a Dirty Harry-style Magnum revolver at Fardel and the Thunder From Down Under troupe while they were at the Excalibur Casino on the Vegas strip, in the middle of their show.

Joey Kadmiri appears in Las Vegas District Court on Tuesday, July 8, 2014. Las Vegas resident Kadmiri is accused of sneaking into the dressing room of Australian, Las Vegas-based stripper troupe Thunder from Down Under, stealing their costumes and then firing a gun when he was apprehended.

Australian Thunder from Down Under stripper, Mathew Fardell, told a Las Vegas court how he tried to pin down the hand of a man threatening to fire a handgun inside their dressing room at the Excalibur casino in Las Vegas

Fardell said he came off stage at their show at the Excalibur Casino on March 18 and was told an intruder was being held by other members of his troupe.

He went out to a patio and saw his fellow strippers Aidan Te Puke and Ryan Paki struggling to control Kadmiri so he decided to subdue him by 'choking him out'.

The struggle continued with more strippers coming to help, before Kadmiri fell back on to the floor with the strippers on top of him.

Fardell said he noticed Kadmiri was wearing  the blue Calvin Klein underpants Mr Te Puke wears in the show under his jeans.

He also noticed under the underpants Kadmiri was wearing one of his tight, black G-strings.

Las Vegas authorities allege Kadmiri was high on a drug, methamphetamine, when he snuck backstage of the Thunder Showroom in the Excalibur Casino on March 18, rifled through the troupe's belongings, and stole G-strings, underpants and other props from their show.

'He (Kadmiri) yelled, “I've got a gun. I'm going to shoot now”,' Mr Fardell told the court on Tuesday.

Mr Fardell didn't believe him after seeing the underpants and G-string.

'I kind of relaxed because, given he was wearing my thong and he had on Aidan's underwear, I thought, "I don't think he'd have a gun",' he said.

He initially thought Kadmiri was talking about one of the fake guns the troupe uses in SWAT and gangster acts in their show. 

'I turned and in his hand was the biggest gun you have ever seen in your life,' he said.

'I don't know guns that well, but I knew it was .44 Magnum. It was massive.'

The performer said he put all of his might on Kadmiri's wrist to make sure the gun was pointing away from them before Kadmiri pulled the trigger, lodging the bullet in the wall of an Italian restaurant at the casino.

Fardell was so close to the gun when it went off he suffered gunpowder burns on his face and in his left eye, and also suffered tinnitus in his left ear.

The ear was bleeding, but after security and police took Kadmiri into custody, Fardell and his troupe went back on stage to finish the show.

'I could feel blood dripping on my shirt,' Mr said.

'It's a miracle that no one was killed,' Prosecutor Kenneth Portz said in his opening address.

'These men don't miss the gym all that much, and it still took six men to hold him.'

The .44 calibre Magnum revolver was a gun made famous by Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies, Mr Portz told the court.

Prosecutors on Monday dropped eight of 17 charges originally filed by a grand jury in the case, including attempted murder, armed robbery and several counts of robbery with a weapon.

The accused suffered a black eye and other minor injuries during the scuffle that saw him allegedly fire a gun

Kadmiri plead not guilty and his lawyers, Joshua Tomsheck and Roy Nelson, plan to make their opening arguments later this week.

Police later found that Kadmiri had with him a pair of surgical gloves, an open 2.1-gram plastic packet of methamphetamine and a box of bullets for the handgun.

His lawyers haven't confirmed if Kadmiri will testify.

A trial date is expected to be set at a hearing on October 3.

Kadmiri is being held in a Vegas detention centre on $US500,000 bail.
