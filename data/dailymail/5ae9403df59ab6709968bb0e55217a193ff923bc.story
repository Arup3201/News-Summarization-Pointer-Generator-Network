It's been quite a week for 21-year-old Tom Thorpe.

On Saturday, he made his Manchester United first-team debut with a late cameo in the 2-1 win over West Ham and then on Monday he capped a commanding performance as captain of the Under 21 side with a towering, last-minute header to beat Tottenham.

But who is the latest exciting prospect to roll off the prestigious United production line?

Name: Tom Thorpe

Age: 21

Club: Manchester United

Position: Centre-back

Why all the fuss?

Not many players can say they've played in front of 76,000 at Old Trafford and 1,600 at Stevenage's Lamex Stadium within the space of three days, but Tom Thorpe impressed in both of these very contrasting arenas.

The 21-year-old was thrown on by Louis van Gaal for his United first-team debut as they went backs-to-the-wall with 10 men to prevent West Ham stealing a stoppage time equaliser.

Thorpe may have only been on the field for a few minutes but United got the job done, holding on for three precious points to alleviate the pressure on the Dutchman.

48 hours later and Thorpe was back to his day job as United's under 21 skipper as they beat Tottenham thanks to a late flurry of goals on a foggy night in Hertfordshire.

Adnan Januzaj was the undoubted star attraction for those who turned out - and scored a spectacular free-kick - but the contribution of Thorpe was certainly worthy of note.

He was rock solid at the back as goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard was seldom troubled and he showed tremendous presence in the air to power home a header from Januzaj's corner to settle the match 2-1 in United's favour.

His goal was enough to send United top of the Under 21 Premier League too, ending a nice afterword to the extraordinary story of his weekend.

With United in the grip of an injury crisis, particularly at centre-half, Thorpe is likely to be again included in the squad for Sunday's home match with Everton.

It was Patrick McNair that started in that position against West Ham but this weekend could see Thorpe's turn.

He has waited patiently for his chance, a little longer than other members of the under 18 team he captained success in the 2011 FA Youth Cup.

Of that talented crop, Tyler Blackett, Larnell Cole, Paul Pogba, Will Keane, Michael Keane, Ryan Tunnicliffe and Ravel Morrison all went on to make their first-team bows.

But finally, at the age of 21, it looks like Thorpe's time has come.

What's his background?

For someone so young, Thorpe has already achieved plenty. As well as that Youth Cup triumph, in which United beat Sheffield United 6-3 on aggregate, he was a member of the England team that won the Under 17 European Championship back in 2010.

Hailing from Manchester and a lifelong United fan, Thorpe joined United's academy at the age of 16 in July 2009 having already made half-a-dozen appearances for the club's under 18 side.

He got his first taste of success in a red shirt as part of the under 17 team that retained the Milk Cup in Northern Ireland in 2009.

His presence at the back is shown by the fact United conceded just two goals as they progressed through the tournament, beating County Antrim, Club Cantalao, Desportivo Brasil, Fenerbahce and Sheffield United.

The summer of 2010 saw the defender sign his first professional contract and, after impressing in the youth team's eight-match unbeaten run from the beginning of the following campaign, he was elevated to the reserves.

His debut at that level came on September 27, 2010 against Blackburn Rovers and he scored his first goal for them against Bolton on November 2.

The season's highlight, however, was United's run in the Youth Cup which saw them defeat Portsmouth, West Ham, Newcastle United, Liverpool, Chelsea and then the Blades in the two-legged final.

Thorpe had the honour of lifting the the Youth Cup at Old Trafford, the 10th time the club had won the competition.

His performances earned a permanent place in the reserves squad for the 2011-2012 season and a maiden call-up to the first-team squad followed in late September, though he didn't take the field in United's League Cup win over Leeds United.

Thorpe spent some of the season out of position in midfield but he adapted admirably and was a central part of the team that won the Manchester Senior Cup, beating rivals City 2-0 in the final.

More glory followed in 2012-2013 as he captained the reserves - now known as the Under 21s - to victory in the inaugural Under 21 Premier League.

They beat Tottenham 3-2 in the Old Trafford final and Thorpe had yet more silverware to add to his collection.

Last season saw Thorpe, as well as Blackett and Federico Macheda, head to Birmingham City for a spell on loan. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to gain the Championship game time anticipated as an ankle ligament injury curtailed his time at St Andrews.

Having recovered over the summer, Thorpe returned as Under 21 captain and is now perhaps on the verge of a first-team breakthrough.

What about international honours?

Thorpe has played for England at every level from Under 16s to Under 21s and has also been entrusted with leadership responsibiltiies.

As mentioned, he led the Under 17s to victory in the 2010 Euros, which were staged in Liechtenstein as they beat a very talented Spain side 2-1 in the final.

His first England appearance had come in the Victory Shield back in 2008 and he has played in midfield for his country on a number of occasions too.

He captained the Under 19s to the semi-finals of the European Championships in 2012. Having emerged from a group containing Croatia, Serbia and France, England were beaten 2-1 by Greece in the last four of the competition staged in Estonia.

Thorpe was a member of the England Under 20s squad for the World Cup in Turkey last year but the team, led by Peter Taylor, were woeful and failed to win any of their three matches.

He came on as a substitute to make his Under 21 debut in England's 6-0 win over Scotland at Bramall Lane in August 2013.

What are his qualities?

The fact Thorpe has been handed the captain's armband for both club and country demonstrates a maturity beyond his years and leadership abilities.

He is vocal at the back and good at marhsalling and motivating his team-mates.

United like to play the ball out from the back and Thorpe is always aware of opposition players in his vicinity to play the correct pass.

As his header against Spurs showed, Thorpe is powerful in the air, a useful attribute both at the back and from set-pieces going forward.

His versatility in being able to play a central position both in defence and midfield is also an advantage.

What happens now?

Having gained a taste of life in the first-team, Thorpe will want more chances to show the United faithful what he can do.

As long as United's defensive injury crisis continues, those opportunities could be there and Van Gaal is clearly willing to give youngsters their chance.

He will continue to captain the second-string and if he continues to turn in performances as he did on Monday night, then those chances at a higher level should naturally emerge.
