Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and the 'mouthpiece' for al-Qaeda pleaded not guilty today to charges he conspired to kill Americans on 9/11.

Sulaiman Abu Ghaith entered the plea through a lawyer just blocks from where the World Trade Center once stood. He  has been charged with 
participating in a conspiracy to kill Americans in relation to the 9/11 
attacks, according to a newly-unsealed indictment.

Ghaith was arrested in a dramatic take-down by CIA officials in Jordan several days ago, and is now being held in a detention facility in lower Manhattan.

In 2001, Abu Ghaith is said to have 
been imprisoned alongside al-Qaeda’s military director Saif al-Adel and 
bin Laden's son Saad, after the leader sent them to Iran in the 
hopes that they would be seen as ‘an enemy of my enemy,’ a U.S. official
said.

Although the U.S. would not confirm 
the conditions of their confinement, Iranian officials told NBC News the
al-Qaeda leaders had been captured shortly after their arrival in the 
country in 2001 and had spent time ‘in jail.’

Court papers state that before the 9/11 attacks, bin Laden 'summoned' Ghait to his side and asked for his assistance.

Ghaith then warned the U.S. and its allies that 'a great army is gathering against you' and after the terror attacks 'the storms shall not stop, especially the Airplanes Storm.'

He is scheduled for his arraignment in U.S. District Court today before Judge Lewis Kaplan.

The court is located less than a mile from the World Trade Center towers, which were destroyed in the 9/11 
terror attacks.

He is currently being held in the 'terror wing' at the Metropolitan Correctional Center near the federal courthouse, the New York Post said. The prison has previously held such high-value arrests such as radical preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri.

Ghaith will be the most senior al-Qaeda member and closest bin Laden associate to face a trial in New York.

Others, including 'mastermind' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, are being tried by a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

Attorney General Holder said in a statement: 'No amount of distance or time will weaken our resolve to bring America's enemies to justice.

'To violent extremists who threaten the American people and seek to undermine our way of life, this arrest sends an unmistakable message:

'There is no corner of the world where you can escape from justice because we will do everything in our power to hold you accountable to the fullest extent of the law.'

Records compiled by a United Nations 
sanctions committee show that Abu Ghaith was born in Kuwait in 1965, but
that he left Kuwait for Pakistan in June 2001.

He then married one of bin Laden's daughters, Fatima.

'Ghaith  held a key position in al-Qaeda, comparable to the consigliere in a mob family or propaganda minister in a totalitarian regime,' said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Venizelo.

After the September 11 attacks, Ghaith first surfaced as one of al-Qaeda's main spokesmen.

Later,
U.S. officials believe he was part of a group of top figures in the 
group that included one of bin Laden's sons, Saad, who allegedly 
traveled to Iran, where the Iranian government claimed they were 'in 
custody.'

The Long War 
Journal, a counterterrorism blog published by the conservative 
Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, reported in 2010 that Abu 
Ghaith had been released by Iranian authorities and supposedly had 
returned to Afghanistan.

Rep. Peter King (R-NY) announced Ghaith's arrest on Thursday, hailing it as a 'very significant victory' in the ongoing fight against al-Qaeda.

King, the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the CIA and FBI had caught Ghaith within the last week.

He said the arrest was confirmed by U.S. law enforcement officials.

Ghaith had allegedly taken part in the September 11 plot against the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

'Definitely, one by one, we are getting the top echelons of al-Qaeda,' King said on Thursday.

'I give the (Obama) administration credit for this: it's steady and it's unrelenting and it's very successful.'

A terrorism analyst called  Ghaith a 'big fish' who represents the 'core of al-Qaeda.'

'Ghaith is one of ten guys left that have the financial ties and reputation who might have been able to get the old band back together to execute spectacular international terror attacks,' Dr. Thomas Lynch at the National Defense University told ABC News.

Turkish newspaper Hürriyet reported that Ghaith was passing through Jordan, on his way to Kuwait from Turkey when he was apprehended.

The newspaper said that Ghaith was initially taken into custody more than a month ago at a luxury hotel in the Turkish capital Ankara.

Turkish officials decided he had not committed any crime in Turkey and released him the newspaper reported.

A Turkish court reportedly ruled that 
Abu Ghaith entered the country illegally from Iran on a fake passport 
and was ordered to be deported.

As a result of that ruling, Abu Ghaith 
was seized in Jordan by CIA agents while en route to Kuwait.

Ghaith
had been considered 'stateless' since since he lost his Kuwaiti 
citizenship after videos emerged showing him praising the September 11 
attacks.

However, Turkish officials refused to confirm Ghaith's deportation or his capture in Jordan to The Associated Press.

In Amman, the Jordanian capital, a security official said he had no information on the CIA arrest.

U.S. intelligence officials in Washington did not immediately respond to request for information about Ghaith either.

'I trust he received a vigorous interrogation, and will face swift and certain justice,' King added.
