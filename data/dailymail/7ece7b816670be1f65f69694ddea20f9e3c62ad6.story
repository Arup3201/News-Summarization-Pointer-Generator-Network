Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been left powerless to intervene in contract stand-offs with Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson, with club owner John W Henry giving full responsibility in negotiations to business partner Mike Gordon.

Gordon, the president of Henry’s Boston-based Fenway Sports Group and the second largest shareholder at Liverpool, has been entrusted to play hardball over new deals while Rodgers tries to focus his players on qualifying for the Champions League.

A final offer of £100,000-a-week has been made to 20-year-old Sterling but, like Luis Suarez two years ago, the England international won’t be allowed to force his way out of the club this summer with more than two years to go on his existing deal.

Henderson, seen by Rodgers as his captain next season when Steven Gerrard goes to America, is holding out for £90,000-a-week but has been offered around £60,000.

There are also major pay obstacles over proposed new deals for Martin Skrtel, Jordon Ibe and Glen Johnson. 

The Jamaican-born winger has scored 10 goals in all competitions this season

Rodgers had previously claimed that the club would not be held to ransom by the player's agent

Ahead of Sunday's trip to his old club Swansea, Rodgers said: ‘I don’t even know what Raheem wants (financially) to be honest, I just get him to concentrate on his football.

‘I just hope for the kid’s sake it gets resolved.

‘Ultimately it can be about two things for players and representatives — game time and money.

‘As a manager you want to give everything to the player to help them but ultimately if they, or more so their representative, decides the player needs to move, that is normally what happens.

‘I think this club has all the intention of wrapping these deals up but it’s not just the club, you have to remember that. There are two sides to it.’
