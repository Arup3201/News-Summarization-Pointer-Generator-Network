Outgoing Network Rail boss Iain Coucher received a £1.6million 'golden goodbye' when he quit the troubled firm, it emerged yesterday.

Details of his lavish payoff were revealed in the company's annual report, fuelling fresh outrage over public-sector fat cats.

Mr Coucher, 49, quit the rail-infrastructure firm last October after three years as chief executive, citing 'personal reasons'.

He received a compensation package of £1,075,000, salary of £359,000, pension of £214,000 and benefits of £9,000, according to Network Rail's annual report.

Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said the package typified the profligacy allowed to flourish at the expense of the public purse under the last Labour government.

'This payoff will stick in the gullet of every farepayer and taxpayer who think they pay too much to use our railway,' added Mr Hammond.

The package was also condemned by Gerry Doherty, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA), who said Mr Coucher had been 'rewarded for failure' on a grand scale.

Rail passengers were paying the highest fares in Europe, on the most overcrowded network, while Mr Coucher had 'transformed' himself into a multi-millionaire.

'Passengers will be furious that he has walked away with over £1million of taxpayers' money after years of failure,' said Mr Doherty.

Last year Network Rail received £3.7billion in subsidies from the taxpayer as part of a £30billion total for the years from 2009-14.

Mr Coucher had previously been deputy chief executive of Network Rail, but his three years in charge were dogged by allegations of excessive pay and questions over his ‘arrogant’ management style.

During eight years at the company, he received more than £7million in pay and bonuses.

He enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with an Aston Martin funded by a car allowance.

He also received a £20,000 housing allowance for a flat overlooking Regent's Park in London, and, in addition to a house in the Midlands, owned a £1million Highlands estate, which he named 'Iainland'.

An unrepentant Mr Coucher defended his record last night, insisting that while he understood the 'strong sentiments' surrounding executive remuneration, he was proud of his role in the 'transformation of Britain’s railways'.

He had not been required to work his full notice period and 'this triggered a payment in line with my contract'.

But Mr Hammond said: 'Most people will feel it doesn’t sit well given the difficult times most families are facing.

'I will be seeking assurances that this is the last chapter in the sorry saga of the old Network Rail as set up by Gordon Brown.'

The railways should 'clamp down on unsustainable practices dependent on public subsidy'.

While Network Rail has insisted it will not pay annual bonuses to executives this year, four current directors received more than £280,000 in 'long-term incentive' rewards between them in the last financial year. Individual payments ranged from £61,725 to £90,723.
