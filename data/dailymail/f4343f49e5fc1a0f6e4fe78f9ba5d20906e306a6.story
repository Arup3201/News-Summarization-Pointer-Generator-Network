A fire tore through Latvia's historic Riga Castle last night, causing massive damage to two floors and leaving the roof virtually destroyed.

The medieval building is traditionally the home of the Latvian president, but Andris Berzins had moved out while reconstruction work was taking place.

Riga Castle also houses the National History Museum of Latvia, and officials said some significant items had suffered water damage as fire fighters battled through the night to bring the blaze under control.

Damage: A blaze tore through Latvia's Riga Castle - which houses the president's official residence - overnight last night

Flames: The castle usually serves as the residence of Latvian president Andris Berzins, but he is currently living elsewhere as reconstruction work was underway at the building

Viktorija Sembele, a spokeswoman for 
the State Fire and Rescue Service, said today that the overnight fire 
damaged the roof and the second and third floors of the castle.

She said some 'significant' items on display in the National History Museum of Latvia had been left with water damage, but that none were destroyed.

The cause of the fire is under investigation. Sembele says one firefighter was treated for smoke inhalation.

A team of 10 fire crews helped to tackle the blaze, and the army provided a helicopter to drop water collected from the river onto the flames.

Founded in 1330, Riga Castle was substantially rebuilt between 1497 and 1515.

It overlooks the banks of the River Daugava in the Latvian capital.

Safety: A firefighter on a crane sprays water onto the blaze, which caused massive damage to the roof of the castle

Historic: The cause of the fire, which raged through the night on Thursday at the centuries-old castle in the Latvian capital, is currently under investigation

Roof fire: Nobody is thought to have been injured in the blaze, but the flames caused extensive damage to the roof and the second and third floors of the historic building

Destroyed: The roof of the 14th century building - where reconstruction work had been underway - appears to have been all but destroyed by the blaze

Battle: A firefighter sprays water to try and damp down the flames at the building, which also houses Latvia's National History Museum

Dramatic scenes: Smoke billows in the air above Riga Castle in Latvia, where a fire broke out overnight last night

Burning: The historic castle overlooks the banks of the River Daugava in Riga, the Latvian capital

Smoke: The building, originally founded in 1330, was thoroughly rebuilt between 1497 and 1515
