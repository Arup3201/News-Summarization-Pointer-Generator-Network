It is every TV news reporter's worst nightmare.

You're in the middle of a live report when somebody deliberately interrupts your broadcast... but this reporter presumably never imagined he would also have to with a leotard wearing unicorn making strange high-pitched noises.

Yet, this is precisely what happened to WLTV Good Morning Jacksonville reporter David Williams while reporting from a street in Arlington, in Jacksonville, Florida, where a fire had broken out in an attic.

Nobody was injured in the fire, but during the report for the 6pm newscast, a woman wearing a unicorn's head and a pink tutu and leotard appeared to taunt Williams by running up to the reporter, waving her arms in the air and making bizarre noises.

The TV reporter however appeared uperturbed by the incident and finished off his report before handing back to the studio.

Jacksonville
 Fire Rescue Chief Roger Lewis said the fire could have been started by 
hot materials left on the roof by constructions crews, First Coast News has reported.

Two people and four dogs managed to make it safely out of the house before fire crews put the fire out in about 15 minutes.

It's not the first time a news reporter has been the victim of a 'video bomber' inerrupting their live report.

In
 fact one Chicago TV reporter became so fed up of being interrupted by 
passers-by who made gestures behind his back he decided to embarrass 
them with a series of personal questions.

MailOnline
 reported in July last year how bosses at Paul Tomasulo's TV station 
allowed him to exact his revenge by pretending to be broadcasting and 
grabbing his victims for live interviews on air

But instead of asking them sensible questions he asked them about erectile dysfunction and why they wore ladies underwear.

One bemused man was asked how long he had been using cream to get rid of a rash.

Embarrassed by the personal questions many of the 'video bombers' quickly slink away out of shot of the camera.

Tomasulo was given free rein to take his revenge in a segment on WGN-TV called 'The Pat-Down'.The embarrassing interviews take place in a Chicago Mall.
