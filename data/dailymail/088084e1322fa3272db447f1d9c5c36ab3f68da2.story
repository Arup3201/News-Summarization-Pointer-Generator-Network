Basketball great Shaquille O’Neal has endorsed the re-election of New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie, describing him as a 'great man', in a new television advertisement.

While Christie is expected to win the November 5 election, commentators say Shaq's public show of support could help to seal the deal. 

The NBA star - who was born in Newark, New Jersey but lives in Florida - makes his case for why voters should back 'The Governor' in the 30-second ad.

Supportive: NBA great Shaquille O?Neal has endorsed New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie in a new television ad

Good timing: The 30-second ad was unveiled days before the start of the NBA season and the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy

'I don’t endorse many politicians. But Chris Christie is different,' Shaq, 41, says.

'He’s working with me to bring jobs back to our cities and on a new program to help kids in tough neighborhoods get ahead.

'Governor Christie’s provided more funding for schools, given parents more choices in what schools their kids can go to, and merit pay for good teachers.

'He’s a good man. Excuse me, he’s a great man. Please join me in supporting Chris Christie – the Governor.'

The clip was revealed days before the start of the basketball season and the first anniversary of Hurricane Sandy.

Shaq and Christie met in March to talk about how O'Neal might help with the New 
Jersey's ongoing gun buyback programs being led by the attorney general,
according to NJ.com. 

Shaq has used his profile to campaign for better education outcomes and healthy eating for children, including by executive producing a six-part reality series, Shaq's Big Challenge.

Commentators say Shaq's support illustrates Christie's ability to 'pull together unexpected coalitions', including African American voters.

The governor's election strategy has been to reach out to traditionally Democratic voters in minority communities, according to NJ.com.

Politico reported Christie is going into the election race with strong favorability ratings among African Americans.

The latest Fairleigh-Dickinson poll 
shows 53 percent of non-white voters approve of Christie’s job in 
office, while only 34 percent disapprove, according to The Daily Beast.

And he's beating his Democratic opponent Barbara Buono among 
non-white voters by an eight-point margin.

While Christie won only nine percent of the 
African American vote when he first ran in 2009, he has more than 
tripled his support after four years in office.

Not according to plan: Clint Eastwood's 'invisible Obama' routine at a Republican National Convention last year didn't go down well

So far, Christie has received the support of 25 
prominent African-American elected officials and pastors from across New
Jersey in addition to 52 Democratic politicos.

Driving that is the governor's backing of school choice and The Opportunity Scholarship Act, which would have 
funded a pilot program offering state scholarships to low income 
students so they could leave dodgy public schools. Democrats 
blocked the bill in the statehouse.

Shaq’s endorsement
specifically emphasizes Christie's work in this area.

However, as The Daily Beast reports, some celebrity endorsements backfire spectacularly, including Clint Eastwood’s
rambling performance at last year's Republican National Convention.

The Hollywood legend confused attendees and sparked a social media storm after talking to an empty stool and telling an imaginary President Barack Obama, 'I'm not going to shut up.'
