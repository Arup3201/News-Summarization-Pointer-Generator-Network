Tragic: Amanda Todd, 15, was found dead on October 10 after killing herself to escape cyber bullies

Anonymous has named a man it claims posted topless pictures of a 15-year-old girl online and harassed her so relentlessly that she killed herself.

Amanda Todd, from Vancouver, Canada, was found hanged in her home on October 10, just weeks after she uploaded a video to YouTube detailing her horrific treatment at the hands of cyber bullies.

When she was just 12, a man in an internet chat room convinced her to flash her breasts, and a year later, he plastered a picture of the incident across Facebook.

Now in a vigilante move, Anonymous, the world's largest hacking group, has named the man allegedly responsible for the picture.

The group claims that he is a 32-year-old from British Columbia, but MailOnline has chosen not to identify him for legal reasons.

As Todd's supporters set up Facebook pages warning the man to 'sleep with one eye open', the move by Anonymous sparks concerns over its abilities to create a 'trial by internet' - bypassing the justice system and casting guilt.

In a video posted to YouTube by Anonymous, a figure claims the group lists his personal information, including his date of birth and address.

It explains that his username appears on websites where he 'blackmailed' and gave advice to young girls. The same username is also tied to a website with a 'jailbait' photo gallery.

Revealed: In a YouTube video, Anonymous claimed that the man behind the bullying was a 32-year-old from British Columbia

'[He] is an abomination to our society, and will be punished,' the Anonymous figure says.

Referring to the possibility they 
might have the wrong man, they add: 'At the most this is the person who 
did this to Amanda Todd, and at the least it's another pedophile that 
enjoys taking advantage of children.'

Following
 Anonymous' announcement, the web moved swiftly, with groups calling for
 his death and warning him to 'sleep with one eye open' cropping up on Facebook.

CKNW reporters
 have unsuccessfully tried to speak with the man, and neighbours have 
described his home as 'a known party house on the weekend with lots of 
young women coming and going'.

But police attended the home on Monday 
after a neighbour, Chyne Simpson, said Anonymous named the wrong 
address. He said he felt threatened by internet users and asked them to 
stay away.

Haunting: Amanda posted a nine-minute video explaining her longstanding bullying on a series of notecards

Depressing: The story reveals that she previously tried to kill herself twice and is receiving help

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
refused to confirm Anonymous have the right man but a spokesperson said they were 
aware that someone had been named.

'We are aware of what’s being posted 
online and certainly following up what we feel is important to follow 
up,' Sergeant Peter Thiessen told The Globe and Mail, adding: '[Vigilantes] run the risk of 
committing a criminal offence.'

Todd's family members also said they 
are not sure the Anonymous report is accurate and said police 
have tracked down a person living in the U.S. whom they 
believed was involved.

The claims come weeks after Amanda posted a nearly nine-minute YouTube video detailing her 
treatment on a stack of notecards held up to the camera,

Todd says that a
 year after she flashed her breasts, the man tracked her down and demanded he put on a show for 
him or he would expose her.

Final message: The video was posted just over a month before she was found dead on Wednesday

When she refused, he created a Facebook
 page with a list of her friends and used her naked chest as the profile
 photo. The picture quickly spread across the internet and among her 
classmates.

It led to 
relentless bullying online, she said, and she was diagnosed with 
depression and started drinking.

In the video, posted September 7, she admitted that she had previously tried to kill herself twice and has been hospitalised.

After
 moving to a different city and school, another instance of bullying 
occurred after she started a romantic relationship with an older man who
 had a girlfriend.

Once that relationship soured, she was confronted and beaten up by the man's girlfriend. She was hit in front of a crowd of screaming people who encouraged her to be left in a ditch.

Suicide: Todd was found hanged in her home on October 10 - just one month before her 16th birthday

Trouble: It came after she flashed on a webcam and the image of her topless was posted to Facebook

Amanda
 does not speak in the video, and her face is not fully shown, but she 
confirmed her identity with the last notecard which says her name.

One of the final images is a jarring picture of her arm which had been cut repeatedly. Just under six weeks after posting the video, Todd could take the 
bullying no longer, and took her own life.

During a memorial for Todd on Monday, her friends said they have been aware of a man in his 30s 'stalking' their friend for years.

'There were multiple accounts with random names,' one friend told QMI Agency. 'There were Twitter accounts also used.'

The Vancouver Sun reported that Amanda was a student in Grade 10 at the Coquitlam Basic Alternative Education school.

Loss: Flowers and candles are left at the memorial, five days after Todd killed herself to escape the bullies

The principal of the school confirmed 
her death and said that she had become connected with many since she 
transferred to the school in the middle of last year.

'It is a very sad case,' Paul 
McNaughton told the paper. 'I can tell you we feel we tried everything 
we could to help her when she came to us.'

Her death prompted a local politician to release a video of her own that pleads to put an end to bullying.

'I just heard about Amanda. I want to say to everyone who loved her, to all her family and friends, how sorry I am about her loss,' British Columbia premier Christy Clark said.

'No one deserves to be bullied. No one earns it. No one asks for it. It isn't a rite of passage. Bullying has to stop.'

Anonymous is an umbrella term for an internet subculture – a collection of individuals, 
or 'hacktivists', who share common ideas of anti-censorship and freedom 
of speech on the internet.

While Anonymous is focused on freedom of speech, releasing names of internet harassers is new territory for the group, which is best known for hacking government and company websites.

They have carried out cyber attacks on Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Amazon, and have threatened to take down Facebook and Twitter servers.

The group has connections with the lesser-known hacking group LulzSec, short for Lulz Security, an elite hacker group that has claimed responsibility for high-profile, debilitating cyber attacks.

Their big hits include the compromising of user account data from Sony Pictures and taking the CIA website offline. They also attacked Fox.com, leaking the names of more than 7,000 X Factor contestants, and the PBS Newshour website, where they posted a story claiming that slain killer Tupac was still living and in New Zealand.

The group aims to cause mayhem and manipulate flaws in security and passwords systems. It is believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, banks and agencies.

It hit the headlines in March this year after Hector Xavier Monsegur, one of the group's ringleaders and an influential member of Anonymous, turned fellow hackers over to authorities.

After his arrest in New York on hacking charges in June 2011, the 28-year-old reportedly began working with the FBI to bring down the groups' top members, and five were later arrested.
