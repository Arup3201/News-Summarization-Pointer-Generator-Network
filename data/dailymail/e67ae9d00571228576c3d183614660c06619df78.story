A housing estate where three out of four people are on benefits and four out of five children grow up in poverty has been named the most deprived area in England for a fifth consecutive year.

The latest figures also show 72 per cent of people living on the Falinge estate in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, are unemployed.

The town's Labour MP, Simon Danczuk, says not enough is being done to improve the area and has called for prompt action to halt its decline.

Unacceptable: MP Simon Danczuk said Rochdale had to 'face facts' and tackle the 'real issue'

Decline: Four out of five children on the estate are growing up in poverty, according to Government data

The Department for Communities and Local Government published the table after combining income and employment data to create an overall deprivation rank.

1. Falinge (Rochdale)

2. Langworthy (Salford)

3. Everton (Liverpool)

4. Grangetown (Redcar/Cleveland)

5. Sparkbrook (Birmingham)

6. Birkenhead North (Wirral)

7. East Jaywick (Tendring)

8. Granby (Liverpool)

9. North Huyton (Knowsley)

10. Hupurhey (Manchester)

Harpurhey, also in Greater Manchester, which is home to nine of the 50 most deprived areas, had topped the rankings since the figures were first published in 2002.

An area in Langworthy, Salford, was ranked second-most deprived and Harpurhey was in the top 10.

The least deprived area was the village of Little Eriswell in Suffolk, followed by neighbouring RAF base Lakenheath.

The statistics show Falinge has 71 per cent of people living in low-income households and 72 per cent claiming out-of-work benefits.

It is home to around 1,500 people - 80 per cent of who are white British.

More than 200 children on the estate are growing up in poverty, with around 800 people claiming council tax or housing benefits.

People living in Falinge are not expected to live beyond the age of 69 - while those living just two miles away in Norden and Banford can expected to live for 10 years longer.

The council's own statistics show Falinge also has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the country, with one in 10 girls giving birth under the age of 18.

Up to date crime statistics show 
there were nearly 70 violent crimes in the north Rochdale area in a 
single month at the end of last year, with more than 200 incidents of 
anti-social behaviour and nearly 60 burglaries.

Seven per cent of people living there have never worked, 82 per cent claim benefits and 59 per cent have no employable skills.

Mr
Danczuk said residents were paying the price for opportunities missed 
by the Rochdale Development Agency, which works with the local authority
to attract investment in the area.

He
said: 'It's not acceptable that the area continues to top these 
government deprivation tables. Not enough is being done and we need to 
act now to turn it around.

'There
are definitely problems in Falinge. I could start trying to claim the 
figures are wrong or out of date but we have to face facts, there are 
real issues that have to be tackled.

'There has been a failure by the local 
authorities to regenerate and it's frustrating to see brownfield sites 
that just aren't being developed.

'To improve the area we need to help build the confidence of the people who live there and provide them with opportunities.'

The figures are taken from analysis of 
data collected in 2009, and Rochdale council leader, Colin Lambert, 
argued that they do not reflect the current situation.

Cash strapped: The statistics show Falinge has 71 per cent of people living in low-income households

1. Little Eriswell (Suffolk)

2. RAF Lakenheath (Suffolk)

3.Tyler Hill (Canterbury)

4. Leckhampton (Cambridge)

5. Knightsbirdge (London)

6. Stoke Bishop (Bristol)

7. Princes Gardens, Kensington (London)

8. Weetwood (Leeds)

9. Gibbet Hill (Coventry)

10. City centre (Cambridge)

He said: 'For example, the latest figures for the ward the Falinge estate is in shows the percentage of working-age residents claiming Job Seekers Allowance has fallen over the last 12 months - for young job seekers by 13.1 per cent.'

Cllr Lambert added the council was working to give Falinge residents more job opportunities, with two active work clubs in the area and new jobs being attracted to the borough.

In 2010, a Falinge resident Gillian Duffy grabbed headlines when the then Prime Minister, Gordon Brown was recorded calling her a bigot on a visit to Rochdale.

Last year Rochdale was rocked by an investigation into a sex trafficking gang, which preyed on vulnerable young girls.

It led to nine men being jailed in May for grooming girls as young as 13 for sexual exploitation.

The deprivation figures have been 
published amid concerns that rising levels of poverty and scarce job 
prospects for young people could lead to fresh unrest on Britain's 
streets.

The head of the International Red 
Cross, Yves Daccord, today said worsening economic and social conditions
could see a repeat of the summer riots of 2011.

Mr Daccord warned that tensions across Europe were rising and Britain could not be immune.

He
accepted the continent has suffered from poverty in the past, but said 
the situation now is being exacerbated as austerity policies mean that 
state support for those on low incomes is being cut back.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World 
At One, Mr Daccord said: 'When you have large numbers of young people - 
educated, unemployed - and at the same time not real options in front of
them, yes, you could have absolutely a violent situation.

Optimism: 'The percentage of working-age residents claiming Job Seekers Allowance has fallen'

Least deprived: Little Eriswell, next to RAF Lakenheath, is home servicemen and women and their families

'We could be confronted with a large 
situation of unrest. Absolutely. We will be confronted with tensions and
problems, we have seen that already in a country like Spain.

'We have seen that also - even though the situation was different - in the unrest in London in 2011.

'In
Europe - and the UK is not apart from Europe - if the economic pressure
on people goes on, yes, it will have a social impact on people.

'If young people especially don't see any future, any options, you might be confronted with unrest like in 2011.

'There is no reason why this unrest will not repeat itself.'
