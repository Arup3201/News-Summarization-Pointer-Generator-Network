As college basketball dominates the cable line-up this month, sports fans are looking for any excuse to catch all the action - including by scheduling a vasectomy.

Urologists report a spike in men getting the 'snip' in the first week of the annual March Madness tournament, so patients can spend their recovery time watching TV completely guilt-free.

'We do have (in March) typically about 50 percent more vasectomies than in other months,' Dr Ed Sabanegh, chairman of the Department of Urology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, told CNN.

'A lot of patients come in and say, ‘I have to have this during March Madness, you have to talk to my wife about it. Tell her what my limitations are and that I need to be on the couch'. They’ll even tell us to exaggerate a little about how long it takes to recover.'

March Madness: Urologists report an increase in vasectomies during the annual basketball tournament

While the American Urological Association says it doesn't have data to back the claims, doctors across the country have attested to the 'vasectomy vacation' trend during major sporting events.

This includes 'March Madness', or the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which this year runs from March 18 to April 7. 

The department of urology at the Cleveland Clinic is already preparing by opening up extra appointments to handle the higher number of vasectomies.

'At least half the guys that I’ve got scheduled for later in the week acknowledge that they are here specifically here for that reason,' Dr Stephen Jones, from the Cleveland Clinic, said.

'And in fact the guy this morning said ‘absolutely, that’s why I’m on the schedule for Friday.’ This was my first consultation with him. But as soon as I asked him about it he was a little sheepish to recognize that’s why he’s off work that day.'

During the 15 to 20 minute surgical procedure, tubes are tied to block the release of sperm when a man ejaculates to prevent pregnancy.

Recovery times range from a day to a week, depending on the type of surgery chosen, but rest and ice are generally the recommended treatments.

Dr Sabanegh from the Cleveland Clinic
 claims some enthusiastic fans stroll into their appointment sporting the jerseys of their favorite teams.

'This patient in the past few years came in with his team's logo on an ice bag, Ohio State,' he said.

'He was just excited about the game, and I said, 'We are all Ohio State fans today'.'

Texas urologist Dr Grant Fowler also reported March Madness spike at his clinic, telling CBS the days needed to recover from the procedure coincide with the basketball games. Although he noted he is performing less vasectomies now than during the recession.

In Los Angeles, Mike LaSalle, a 40-year-old father of two, had a vasectomy on Friday.

'If you are going to be laid up on the couch for a few days, you might as well get (a vasectomy) done when there is some great college basketball on TV,' he told CNN.

'You had all the conference championship games over the weekend and the NCAA tourney starts this week.'

Procedure: A vasectomy involves cutting and sealing the vasa deferintia, tubes in the reproductive system that carry sperm

Daily Herald reported that during last year's tournament, Urology Associates of Cape Cod in Massachusetts gave away 41 coupons for free pizza to 
vasectomy patients as part of a promotion.

It declined to repeat the deal this year.

'Want to watch college basketball guilt-free?' the cable ad stated. 'Camp out on the couch for uninterrupted basketball.'

The clinic's practice coordinator, Ethan Cohen, reported an 'uptick' in business.

'The promotion gave the wife an opportunity to take about vasectomies, because in our experience usually the guy doesn't bring it up, it's the wife,' he said.
