Fiona Bruce could be offered the chance to become a staffer

Dozens of BBC stars face an ‘employment test’ as the corporation tries to shake off suspicions it is complicit in tax avoidance.

The BBC wants to analyse how much of its employees’ work is based at the corporation, before deciding whether to force them to be members of staff.

If nearly all of a person’s income comes from the licence fee-funded broadcaster, they face a ban from being paid via a private company and will be required to pay income tax in the normal way.

The BBC will today publish a review into how it pays its top stars, following a political row about its tax arrangements.

MPs have criticised the way the corporation pays some of its performers and presenters through so-called personal service companies, sparking fears it was enabling tax avoidance.

Last month BBC chairman Lord Patten conceded that it was ‘undoubtedly the case’ that some freelance staff would be put on the payroll.

But it is understood that a formula looking at ‘a variety of criteria’ will be used to decide whether to make them members of staff.

The full nature of the ‘employment test’ has yet to be defined but insiders say they expect it to be based on how much work the individual does for the corporation.

A senior source said it was likely to stop short of demanding specific details of all of an employee’s outside work, but would probably ask what percentage of income came from companies other than the BBC.

The source said: ‘It will change the way the BBC engages some people and the logical thing will be that some people will be forced back [on to staff books]. That will be the policy.’

Stars such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman, who both said they had been forced to be paid this way, could be offered the chance to become BBC staffers.

But sources admitted it would be a ‘very interesting question’ if stars refused to go back on the books, adding that it had the potential to lead to many difficult individual discussions.

Today’s review is expected to say that the BBC has not been doing anything illegal but that it should have a closer relationship with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. It will highlight the need for a clearer framework to avoid further controversy over how freelance staff are paid.

Lord Patten said last month the review would come up with ‘additional steps’ to ‘clear up any suspicions’. The head of the BBC Trust added: ‘I think it is undoubtedly the case that as a result some freelancers will be put on the payroll.’

Stars at the BBC have expressed anger at bosses that they had been made to look like tax avoiders when they had been told to set up personal service companies by the corporation.

Last month the influential Public Accounts Committee said the off-the-books arrangements created ‘suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance’.

Treasury secretary Danny Alexander said he expected the corporation to take ‘swift and decisive action’ to address public concern.

Personal service companies could save individuals thousands of pounds because they pay  corporation tax rather than income tax.

It has been suggested that those facing a return to the payroll could face pay cuts of up to 40 per cent because national insurance payments will have to be paid for by the BBC, along with other costs.

A BBC spokesman last night refused to discuss the report.
