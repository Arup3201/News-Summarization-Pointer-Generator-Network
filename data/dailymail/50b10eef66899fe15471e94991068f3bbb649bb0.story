Grilled: Gabby Logan was repeatedly asked about her children back home

She was delighted to be part of the BBC team sent out to Brazil to cover the World Cup football tournament.

But Gabby Logan was annoyed to be repeatedly asked: ‘Who’s looking after your children?’

Her nine-year-old twins Reuben and Lois were left at home with their father, former Scottish rugby star Kenny Logan, 42, while Mrs Logan, 41, was working in Brazil.

And despite admitting she was relieved when England were knocked out because it meant she could go back to being a mother, Mrs Logan expressed surprise that people still think a woman’s place is in the home.

In a new interview she said: ‘People still think it’s a woman’s responsibility to organise everything. When I was away, some of the mums at school asked Kenny how he was coping.

'No one asked me that when he was working in Australia last year. I’m often asked who’s looking after the children when I’m away, yet my male colleagues aren’t.’

Mrs Logan went on to admit she was secretly pleased to be leaving Brazil when the England football team were knocked out.

The former gymnast, who also presented at the 2012 Olympics, said: ‘England’s early exit from the World Cup was a silver lining because I could go home to see my kids.

'It was good to get back into a routine again, although Lois assumes the role of the woman of the house when I’m away, and she was a bit put out on my first day back. She said, “Oh, Mummy, I missed you”, but it was like she felt she had to say it!’

Of course, there may be another reason Mrs Logan was glad to be home, after tweeting and blogging about the poor standard of the hotel she was staying in.

She posted a photograph of her room’s faulty hairdryer on social networking site Twitter, while moaning on her blog that the laundry service had misplaced some of her clothes.

And she was miffed one night when she found the burger bar she wanted to eat dinner in was closed for a private event.

But Reuben and Lois would not have known about their mother’s complaints – neither of them are interested in social media.

Mrs Logan told Essentials magazine: ‘I’m mindful of my children being exposed to the Internet as they’re getting older. You worry about what they’re going to find. They know about Twitter and Facebook, but they’re not interested at the moment.’

The football World Cup, which was won by Germany, saw 272 members of BBC staff travel to Brazil to provide TV and radio coverage.

At the time the corporation faced criticism over the size of the line-up, while others thought there should be more women on the team.

But Mrs Logan said she didn’t see the point in sending more females ‘for the sake of it’.

She said: ‘There was an outcry when the BBC unveiled their line-up for the World Cup and I was the only woman. But there were no gaps on the presenting team.

'If you’ve got someone like Dan Walker doing his job brilliantly, why should the BBC push him out and put a woman in for the sake of it? It happens in other industries, not just football. There aren’t enough women at the top in science, in boardrooms, or in the Cabinet.’

As it happened, Mrs Logan emerged as the BBC’s top performer, as her male colleagues faced abuse.

Reflecting on public reaction to her calm presenting style, which she has previously said is down to doing yoga, she said: ‘I just wonder whether I’ve weeded out the idiots or blocked them all, but during the World Cup I received lots of positive comments for the first time.

'There were a few people who tweeted that I’d asked the wrong question in an interview, which is fair enough, but it wasn’t comments about my looks or genitalia I’m glad to say.'
