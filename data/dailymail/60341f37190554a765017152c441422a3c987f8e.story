Everyone likes a little pampering from time to time and this 40 stone, 7ft tall brown bear is no exception.

Having emerged from a swamp in Finland, he decided to treat himself to a special spa treatment, using only the most natural materials.

Still dripping with water, he exfoliated by scratching his back against the bark of a pine tree, then indulged in a facial, scrubbing away with leaves in his paws.

After that revitalising experience, he no doubt felt considerably less grizzly than when he arrived.

The European brown bear's al-fresco ablutions were captured on camera by photographer Marko Koenig, who witnessed the scene from his position in a hide in Suomussalmi, in the Kainuu region of Finland.

'The bear was scratching his back and marking his territory against a pine,' the 38-year-old said.

'He was having a good scrub for a few minutes near the swamp. I have never seen this before.'

The photographer, who is from Bad Hersfeld, near Frankfurt, Germany, said: 'I like my photographs to show people the beauty and features of nature.'
