Forget an Hermes Birkin or Mulberry Alexa, flamboyant artist Grayson Perry's arm candy of choice is far more daring.

The English artist and CBE, known for his ceramic vases and cross-dressing, was spotted on Channel 4's Liberty of London documentary carrying his beloved 'Scrotal Sac'.

The tote was designed by Grayson himself in the shape of a scrotum, before being moulded into a handbag by leather craftsman Andy Bates.

World's oddest handbag? Grayson Perry has been sporting the 'Scrotal Sac' around London in recent months

The bag, which has toured Europe with Grayson, was made as a gift by Andy Bates from Hexham after he and Grayson met in 2008.

Speaking to MailOnline about the intriguing design, which also has a frontal 'appendage' with a bell at its end, Andy said: 'I received an email from Grayson to which was attached a particular drawing; a drawing which was the potter's design for the 'Scrotal Sac'. I took a deep breath and the process of making began.

Detail: A bell, supplied by Grayson, was added to the end of the appendage, which Andy says he gave a 'ceremonial and celebratory jingle of completion'

'It took months to construct the bag.

'Firstly I had to carve a wooden former and then soak hand-dyed, bark-tanned calfskin in water so that it became malleable and could be moulded around the oaken testicles, a technique which is centuries old.

'Upholstery nails had been driven in so that the details of the "pimples" could be brought out.

'The two halves of the bag were shaped then hand-stitched together using waxed, linen thread.

'Finally,
 a bell, which had been supplied by Grayson himself, was added to the 
end of the appendage and given a ceremonial and celebratory jingle of 
completion.'

The bag was dispatched to Grayson and he reportedly loved it.

The 'Scrotal Sac' has since become a fixture on the arm of Grayson when in role as his alter ego, Clare.

'I
 received enormous interest in the "Scrotal Sac" from around the world 
but have mysteriously declined to make a second,' said Andy, who has 
been shortlisted for the Craft Skills Awards 2013 and has been 
commissioned by Bloomsbury to write the definitive book about leather.
