Outspoken Tasmanian Senator, Jacqui Lambie, says she 'will not be intimidated' as she receives a troubling letter threatening to behead her, unless she converts to Islam and implements Sharia law in Australia.

The letter, which was received last week, has reportedly been referred to the Australian Federal Police after it was found to contain 3 images of a man being beheaded. 

It cautions the senator, she has now been identified as an enemy of the Islamic State Group.

Senator Lambie says she 'will not be intimidated' as a personal security assessment is underway following the threats

'By the powers invested in me by Allah, I sentence you to death,' ABC News has reported the letter says.

'I will take the honour in beheading you ... when you are least prepared; my men and I will take your office by surprise.'

Senator Lambie, who's been a vocal critic of Islamic Sharia law since her debut in Australian politics, maintains she will not be intimidated by the letter and will continue to advocate for harsher penalties intended for those fighting with the Islamic State.

'Obviously someone is trying to intimidate and scare me. I will not be intimidated or scared.

'I will continue to advocate for a ban on Sharia Law, unnecessary face coverings in public and tighter regulation of Halal certification fees in Australia - and to have those Australian Citizens who assist Islamic State in any way, charged with the high crimes of Sedition or Treason.'

A personal security assessment is currently underway to ensure the safety of Senator Lambie following the threats.

Police are currently investigating 'two lines of inquiry'. Firstly, that the letter was sent from a person opposing the erection of a mosque in Adelaide's northern suburbs, alternatively the threat may have been issued by Islamic State group members or supporters of the Sydney siege gunman, Man Haron Monis.

The threat follows Senator Lambie's controversial statements about her intentions to overhaul the Australian citizenship oath and reintroduce death penalty for those accused of treason.

'It's time we adopted a much tougher approach to people who are Australian citizens and have fought or are now fighting alongside our enemies, or assisting them,' she said.

'In those cases the Australian laws are very clear. Australian citizens who take up arms against members of our ADF (Australian Defence Force) are guilty of treason.'

The former Palmer United Party member's campaign comes at a controversial time with politicians, such as Abbott and Bishop, publically condemning the death sentence handed down to convicted drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaram.

Ms Lambie believes revoking citizenship or trying to rehabilitate ISIS fighters returning to Australia is a waste of time, and more importantly,  dangerous for the Australian public.

'Part of my solution to help defeat ISIS is to re-introduce the death penalty as a sentencing option for Australian juries who find our citizens guilty of treason,' she said, specifying the crime as taking up arms against Australian military personnel.

Ms Lambie is pushing for treason charges to be laid against all ex-Australians who have taken up arms with terror groups such as ISIS

'Putting terrorists and would-be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for Islamic extremism.'

'We need to get rid of them permanently. Mr Abbott needs to support the reintroduction of the death penalty for treason and terrorism.' 

Senator Lambie has called for Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, to support her campaign as she believes putting 'would-be terrorists in jail will only turn our prison systems into recruiting centres for Islamic extremism'
