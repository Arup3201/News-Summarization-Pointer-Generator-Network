It is obviously the week for Britain's colourful politicians to come clean about their ambitions.

First Boris Johnson revealed he will stand for election as an MP next year, after years of prevarication.

Now it seems UKIP leader Nigel Farage is about to take the plunge and name the Kent seat of Thanet South as his target to get a foothold in the Commons.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage is the frontrunner to be the party's candidate in Thanet South, it emerged today

The UKIP association in the seat could confirm Mr Farage as its candidate as early as this weekend, the Financial Times reported.

He is said to be on a shortlist of two or three candidates to be chosen by local activists. 

Last month an opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft named Thanet South as one of just two seats where UKIP is already in the lead.

It put UKIP on 33 per cent, ahead of Labour and the Tories tied on 29 per cent and the Lib Dems trailled 4 per cent.

Rozanne Duncan, the local party secretary, told the FT: 'It is the worst-kept secret in town.

'We now have two names on the list and one of them is Mr Farage. Whether he will get selected or not is another matter... although I'd be surprised if he doesn't.'

The seat is considered vulnerable after sitting Tory MP Laura Sandys announced she would stand down in 2015, after being an MP for only five years. 

A UKIP spokesman said: 'The branch are starting to receive nominations from people interested in standing, but there's no shortlist of candidates yet.

'Even when there is a shortlist of candidates finalised for hustings, that list will be kept confidential. We are still a long way off announcing a candidate for Thanet South.'

Mr Farage stood in the in 2005 but came a distance fourth. Since then he has seen a surge in support for his party, culminating in coming first in the European Parliament elections in May.

Mr Farage hopes to build on the electoral success of the party in the last two years, including winning the Europe Parliament elections in May 

Last month an opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft showed Thanet South top be one of just two seats where UKIP was already ahead

Mr Farage tried unsuccessfully to become an MP in 2010, standing against Commons Speaker John Bercow in Buckingham.

But he was defeated, after suffering serious injuries when a light aircraft he was flying in crashed on polling day.

Since then there have been several by-elections in which UKIP has been tipped to perform well, but Mr Farage ducked the chance to stand in.

After dodging Eastleigh and Rotherham, he had been expected to the throw his hat into the ring for Newark. 

After mulling the idea for some time, Mr Farage was accused of 'bottling it' after deciding not to stand himself. 

The news that Mr Farage has selected a seat comes after London Mayor Mr Johnson ended years of speculation and finally confirmed he will also make a bid for Parliament in 2015. 

Boris Johnson finally confirmed this week that he would also be standing for election in 2015, and is hunting for a seat

Speaking at Bloomberg in London on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: 'I have danced around it for an awfully long time. The Prime Minster said ages ago that he would welcome me back.

'It is also been pretty clear I cannot endlessly go on dodging these questions as I have tried to do.

'Let me put it this way. I haven't got any seat lined up yet. But I do think that in all probability, since you cannot do these things furtively, in all probability I will try to find somewhere to stand in 2015.' 

He is yet to find a seat, but is widely expected to opt for Uxbridge where the Tories have a majority of 11,216 and sitting MP Sir John Randall is standing down.
