Victim: Jesse Cortinez, 58, was killed Friday night after a teen ran into him with his car. Police say the teen struck Cortinez after the older man refused to buy him alcohol 

A 58-year-old man in Texas was killed in a hit and run late Friday night by a 16-year-old boy who he refused to buy alcohol for at a 7-Eleven.

Victim Jesse Cortinez was found dead on the side of the road near 7th and Butternut Street in Abilene around midnight.

Witnesses were able to provide a description of the car that hit Cortinez, and the following morning police arrested the teen boy suspected of carrying out the violent attack.The suspect has not been named because he is a minor.

'It's shocking to know that someone would do something like that without letting anybody know why,' Cortinez's 16-year-old daughter Mary told Big Country Homepage.

Cortinez was last seen at the 7-Eleven near his home, where he went to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola Friday night.

Investigators say the teen approached Cortinez outside the store Friday night and asked Cortinez to buy him some beer.

They say Cortinez declined and that the teen drove into him while he was walking away - just two blocks from home.

A vehicle matching the description was found early Saturday behind an Abilene home.

Police arrested the teen after speaking with a number of people found at the home.

On Monday, Abilene police spokesman Rick Tomlin announced that the teen had been charged with murder in juvenile court.

The suspect in question is currently being detained at Taylor County Juvenile Detention Center.

The vehicle he was allegedly driving at the time of the attack, also matches the description of a vehicle involved in a report of shorts fired at a separate location earlier in the night.

The report came from a neighborhood about a mile away from the 7-Eleven where a party was happening.

Witnesses told police that they heard gunshots, saw the car get into a wreck and then drive off.

Police, however, say that the suspect was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol when he killed Cortinez.

Following the tragic loss, Cortinez's family built a memorial near the site where he was killed.

Cortinez's brother, EZ Cortinez remembered Jesse as someone who would 'give you the shirt off his back'

'If somebody confronted him, it would be just like him to just walk away,' he said.
