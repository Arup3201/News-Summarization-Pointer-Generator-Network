Like every fad, the Gangnam Style dance craze that became the most successful YouTube video has had it's day.

But it seems that the cult dance from South Korean rapper Psy that inspired countless parodies is still being recreated by one loyal fan- a European brown bear.

British photographer Mark Sisson captured the cub's movements in Northern Finland in June.

Happy feet: The brown bear cub stand up on his hind legs and crosses his arms to adopt rapper Psy's signature pose

Uncanny: Despite living in a Finnish swamp, the young bear recreates the dance craze with alarming accuracy. His siblings look more interested in the plants around them and his mother looks unamused

Mr Sisson watched in amazement as the cub stood on his hind legs, pranced around and banged his wrists together.

Walking across a swamp with his mother and two siblings, the cub burst into action, despite his family's withering looks.

The single-minded cub continued to prance around on his own in an uncanny recreation of Psy's energetic moves.

Mr Sisson, 
from Shropshire, said: 'These images were taken during a long night 
spent in a photographic hide in northern Finland in late June, where I 
was leading a photographic trip.

'This
 summer there were a couple of European brown bears with families of 
small cubs visiting this swamp area throughout the night.

Going solo: Mark Sisson captured the cub in a remarkable moment when he looks directly at the camera and prances around

Coy? The cub has a bashful moment as he pivots around and turns his back on his unappreciative family

'The cubs are 
always playful and cheeky but this particular youngster seemed to have a
 great delight in standing up and practicing his moves.

'Normally
 standing up like this is to help them see potential danger at a 
distance (their eyesight is not particularly good generally) but this 
youngster had other ideas, and my client sharing the hide commented that
 it reminded him of the Gangnam style of dancing!

'Looking
 through the sequence of images he had begun a bit shyly with his back 
to us, then had another go side-on and once he was happy tried once 
again for his mum and siblings to see - unfortunately all he got was a 
disapproving look from mum and the rest of the family carried on eating!

'Movement
 wise he was moving from side to side, one foot to another and it was 
this along with the positioning of his front paws that really drew the 
Gangnam analogy to mind.'

Copycat: Parodies of the Korean dance, which was released in July 2012 popped up all over the world as it surpassed 1 billion hits
