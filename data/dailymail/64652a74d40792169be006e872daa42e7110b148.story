It is known as the City of Sin, so it is perhaps no surprise to find that the porn industry is moving to Las Vegas after LA passed a law requiring performers to use condoms.

As the industry struggles to survive in an age of free websites and amateur videos uploaded to the internet, producers looking to cut costs are also attracted by the cheap hotels, mansions and warehouses to use for their films.

In a worrying development, many adult film makers are also using the move as a way to get around stringent health checks imposed in LA, including a law requiring all male performers to wear condoms, brought in after several actors tested positive for HIV.

Cheeky: Since a law requiring all male performers to wear condoms in LA requests for permits have dropped 95 per cent, from 480 in 2012 to just 24 in the first nine months of 2013

Several big name producers have already moved to Las Vegas, while experts predict it could house 20 per cent of the industry by the end of this year

The number of permits requested to make porn films in Los Angeles County has declined by an estimated 95 percent since the law took effect, according to Film LA, a private nonprofit that issues the licenses.

The number of applications fell from about 480 in 2012 to just 24 through the first nine months of 2013.

At the Adult entertainment Expo, taking place in Las Vegas this week, porn purveyor Jules Jordan warned reporters not to ask him about condoms, but said: 'It's not really an option to change the way we make our movies, and moving production isn't that hard.'

In Clark County, in the state of Nevada where Vegas is located, there is no law requiring the use of prophylactics and performers are not even required to undergo health checks. The fees required to get a permit are also much smaller.

Fellow producer Lee Roy Myers added: 'Las Vegas is a fresh town, and it's where people need the business.'

Myers says that Las Vegas, in town in which prostitution is legal and women can be ordered to hotel rooms for a minimal fee, was also less squeamish about his line of work than California.

Sitting among child -sized desks in his classroom set, he said: 'They're used to it here because they already kind of have it. Figuring out how to make these things more cheaply won't include shooting in Los Angeles.'

The studio sits in what was once another empty building on blighted Industrial Road behind the town's tourist corridor. Local officials appear content with the arrangement and have no plans to pass additional rules.

'It's a legalized industry and properly regulated, so I don't see it as a problem,' said Clark County commissioner Chris Giunchigliani. 'I think the city and the county will benefit from any expansion of the film industry. It's economic diversification.'

Las Vegas is home to some major porn players, including Brazzers, Bait & Tackle, Corbin Fisher, VCX Ltd. and newcomer Bluebird Film.

As film makers look to cut costs Vegas provides cheap hotel rooms, mansions and warehouses to use for shoots, charges less for permits, and worryingly doesn't require performers to have health checks

Vegas has also been less squeamish about the arrival of adult stars as prostitution is already legal and women can be ordered to rooms for minimal fees

Several producers with top porn purveyor Evil Angel are talking about moving to Las Vegas, according to owner John Stagliano, and enough porn stars have settled down in the area to supply all the extras a film could need, if not all the stars.

Derek Hay, owner of adult talent agency LA Direct Models, opened an office here last autumn. He estimates that 20 per cent of the industry will have moved to Las Vegas by the end of the year.

Some contrarians believe the boom will eventually lead Clark County to adopt the same regulations that are scaring the industry in Los Angeles. This September, the same group that championed the 2012 condom law started a similar campaign in Florida.

For now, concerns about an eventual condom showdown in the desert are not stopping producers from making investments. Myers has several producers coming through his studio this week.

After that, he will turn his attention to repurposing the cave set featured in the high fantasy spoof 'Game of Bones' for another pornographic parody, based on The Hobbit.

Campaigners have also launched a condom campaign against the adult industry in Florida and industry insiders believe it will only be a matter of time before Vegas is forced to follow suit

The star of both films, James Deen, a millennial porn icon who acted alongside Lindsay Lohan in 'The Canyons,' said moving the industry to Las Vegas is just a band aid.

'The issue with running to Vegas is it doesn't actually fix anything,' he said, taking refuge near a stairwell at the convention hall to avoid interruption by a constant stream of fans.

'We should explain to the people who put that law in place why it's unnecessary, and appeal it the same way any community would appeal any asinine law.'

The controversial regulation was passed in 2012 after being championed by Derrick Burts, a former performer and HIV-sufferer, and following an industry shutdown in 2011 after another star contracted the virus - which causes AIDS.

In 2013 there were three shutdowns in LA after several more performers tested positive for the virus.

Performers Rod Daily and his girlfriend Cameron Bay also went public with their joint diagnosis of HIV in order to condemn the adult industry as putting profit before the health of their performers.

And in another damaging blow to the industry's credibility a male performer was caught trying to book a webcam sex session with a female partner, only days after discovering he was infect with HIV.
