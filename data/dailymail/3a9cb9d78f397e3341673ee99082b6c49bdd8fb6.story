The sister of terror suspect Omarjan Azari was charged with assaulting and intimidating police officers at the family home during last month's dramatic counter-terrorism raids.

Police alleged in court on Wednesday that Mursal Azari, 23, assaulted a male constable between 4:45 and 4:46am as officers stormed the brick property in Guildford, in Sydney's western suburbs.

During that same tense minute on the morning of September 18, Ms Azari also allegedly intimidated a female constable, police told a court.

The raids saw Ms Azari's younger brother, Omarjan, arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit acts in preparation of a terrorist attack. Police alleged he was involved in a plot to behead a random member of the public. 

At Parramatta Local Court on Wednesday, Ms Azari pleaded not guilty to both charges through a solicitor. The case is expected to be heard again on December 3. 

Ms Azari declined to comment at the family home on Thursday morning, referring any questions to a barrister who has been reported as representing her brother.

Ms Azari's solicitor, Penelope Purcell, told Daily Mail Australia: 'We are going to be defending the charges', but refused to provide further comment.

By some indications, Azaris' family life has returned to somewhat normal since the raids, while Omarjan Azari remains incarcerated.

The raids involved more than 800 New South Wales police officers and were the largest operation of its kind in the nation's history.

AFP and NSW police officers executed search warrants across the western and north-western suburbs of Sydney, executing search warrants in Beecroft, Bellavista, Guildford, Merrylands, Northmead, Wentworthville, Marsfield, Westmead, Castle Hill, Revesby, Bass Hill and Regents Park.

Bundles of cash and a curved sword - later identified as plastic and as possessing religious significance - were some of the evidence removed from a Sydney home.

Helicopters swooped overhead and dozens of police crowded into the Azaris' Guildford street that September morning. The street had been under surveillance since the second week of May. 

In evidence tendered to Central Local Court, police alleged Mr Azari received a phone call from Mohammed Ali Baryalei - the former Underbelly actor and bouncer who security agencies have identified as a leading recruiter of Australian Islamic State militants - where the conspiracy was discussed.

According to reports, security officials believe half of the 60 Australians fighting for militant groups in the Middle East were recruited by Baryalei.

Ms Azari's parents, Amaljan and Gulpeika, were overseas on the annual Hajj pilgrimage at the time of the raids. It is understood they have since returned to Australia.

On Thursday morning, a young man at the Azari residence, believed to be a sibling of Omarjan, headed to his place of work as a tradesman and a small kitten played in the sunshine in their front window sill.  

Last month, relatives of Omarjan Azari told Daily Mail Australia he was a 'gentle loving person' who had been fanatical about soccer and a keen cricket fan. They said the allegations did not make sense. 

His cousin, Rami, said last month that Omarjan, who was very religious, 'didn't have time' to be involved in any terror plots because 'he studies at night'.

Rami said Omarjan had been aware he was being followed. 'He's only a kid. He was petrified. He's been scared for a long time,' he said. 

'He's been scared for a long time because he was being followed.'

Rami said when they talked, Omarjan would insist they put their mobile phones in the car, so they could ensure no one was listening.

For that reason, he could not believe police had any evidence of a phone call. 

Omarjan Azari will return to court in November.
