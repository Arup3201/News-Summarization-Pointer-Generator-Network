Prince William today joined forces with sporting royalty David Beckham to launch a United For Wildlife Campaign.

The Duke of Cambridge, who is the president of United for Wildlife, launched #WhoseSideAreYouOn, a new campaign which harnesses the power of sport to raise awareness of conservation issues around the world.

William was joined by David Beckham, 
who heads a team of high-profile sporting stars backing this campaign to
 engage young people's support on social networks to combat the illegal 
trade in wildlife products.

Old friends: David Beckham and Prince William are the two main names behind #WhoseSideAreYouOn

Top signings: The pair posed with a signed shirt carrying the campaign social media tag at the event

Good mates: David Beckham and Prince William looked very chummy at the charity launch

Working together: Becks and William also combined on England's unsuccessful World Cup bid in 2010

Thoughtful: The pair were sombre as they watched a short film on protecting endangered species

The pair, 
who both looked dapper in tailored suits, appeared together at Google 
Town Hall (the brand's HQ) in London to speak about the dangers of illegal hunting.

The
 Duke, who sat beside Beckham on the stage at the central London event, 
also gave a short speech in which he spoke of how the 'illegal wildlife 
trade thrives because it is hidden, often invisible, making it easy for 
criminals'.

Beckham,
 who addressed the specially invited audience of conservationists and 
campaigners after William prince, said he had been 'honoured' to be 
asked to get involved by the royal.

Speaking of the illegal wildlife trade, the former England captain said: 'It's devastating. It really is devastating.

'And
 we're in a world where our generation, and the younger generation can 
really, really make a difference and we really need to do it now.

'Are
 we on side of the criminals? Or are we on the side of the animals? I 
know what side we're all on and I'm sure you know what side you're all 
on.'

Beckham,
 who worked closely with William on England's World Cup bid and attended
 his wedding, heads a team of sporting stars backing the campaign 
including Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, India's former batsman Rahul 
Dravid and retired South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar.

Serious aims: Despite their joking and smiles, the pair both are passionate about the charity

Speaking out: Both men made speeches about conservation at the launch in London

The Duke described United for Wildlife as a 'powerful global alliance of seven of the most influential conservation organisations, while Beckham said he was proud to be part of an 'amazing team'

Beckham added: 'It's something that we all feel very passionate about.

'As lead ambassador I'm very proud to also be part of an amazing team - an amazing array of famous faces that are very important to this organisation and very important to this cause.'

Speaking to reporters afterwards, Beckham said: 'I want to make a change, I want to make a difference and If I can do that by just shining a light on something as important as this then it's a good thing."

Asked if he expected to able to influence the parts of the world that drive the illegal wildlife trade, he said: 'Obviously I have quite a big following throughout Asia and especially in China and if it can shine a light on something as important as this then it's job done.

'But obviously having the Duke, the future king of England involved in something like this - there's nothing better.'

During the event, William stood with his hands clasped in front of him as a short film was played highlighting the issues facing park rangers who must face the ever present threat of poachers and risk their own lives in doing so.

The Duke described United for Wildlife as a 'powerful global alliance of seven of the most influential conservation organisations'.

William is also involved through the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

The second in line to the throne went on: 'In February we set out our commitments to improve protection and enforcement, reduce demand and to help the business community to tackle international trafficking.

'That was our first step, but we knew we needed to do more to bring this trade into the open. The illegal wildlife trade thrives because it is hidden, often invisible, making it easy for criminals to build and expand.

'We wanted to find a way to show the world what was happening. Join us and help stop illegal poaching.'

It is hoped the #WhoseSideAreYouOn debate will gather pace on social networking via Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus and YouTube to raise the profile of the issue.

In the run up to the launch, William and his brother Prince Harry posed side by side for a photo for United for Wildlife's Twitter account, each holding a sign bearing the start date '9th June 2014' and their own signature.

Also 
speaking at the event at Google Town Hall in Soho was Emmanuel De 
Merode, the director of Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic
 of Congo, who spoke of the dangers faced by rangers from poachers. Two 
rangers are killed every week and he was shot himself earlier this year.

He
 said the issue was about more than just conservation. 'You have to 
picture wildlife crime in the context of the overall damage that's being
 done to people's resources, and in Congo there is perhaps no greater 
example than that, no more extreme example, because it has provoked a 
war, and this war has seen the death of over six million innocent 
people,' he said.

'This is a war that's driven by the illegal exploitation of natural resources, of which wildlife crime is a part."

Mr
 De Merode, who is a Belgian prince, said he would he able to return to 
Virunga and tell his rangers they were 'in incredibly good company now'.
 He was shot in the stomach and legs by unidentified gunmen in April and
 is thought to have been targeted because of his conservation work.

Beckham, who worked closely with the Duke on England's World Cup bid and attended his wedding, heads a team of sporting stars backing the campaign including Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, India's former batsman Rahul Dravid and retired South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar.

Last September, William and Beckham teamed up when they recorded two video campaigns against illegal wildlife products for WildAid.

Beckham said at the time: 'When I learned of the current poaching levels in Africa, I immediately agreed to help get this message out.

BBC presenter Kate Silverton also attended the event which is being supported by celebrities and sporting stars including Wimbledon champion Andy Murray

'It is shocking to think that we could lose these animals from the wild in our lifetimes.'

The fight against illegal wildlife trade is close to William's heart. In February, he hailed a major international conference in London on the trafficking of endangered wildlife as the 'beginning of the end of this despicable trade'.

World leaders agreed concrete steps to help safeguard endangered animals from poachers - putting their signatures to a declaration of intent.

William attended the event with Harry and their father the Prince of Wales, who gave the keynote speech, as politicians gathered to discuss how best to combat the illegal trade in rhino horn, tiger parts and elephant tusks which fuels criminal activity worth more than an estimated Â£11.5 billion each year.

United for Wildlife is a collaboration between seven conservation organisations and the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.
