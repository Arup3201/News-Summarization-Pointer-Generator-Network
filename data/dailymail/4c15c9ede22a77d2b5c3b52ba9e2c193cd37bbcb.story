She's been a racehorse owner for more than 60 years, breeds Highland ponies at Balmoral and hosts a horse show at Windsor each year.

And it seems the Queen's love of all things equine has proved equal to the demands of advancing age, after she was photographed trotting around the Windsor estate this morning.

Perched on the back of her current mount, Fell pony Carltonlima Emma, the monarch looked on spritely form as she enjoyed the June sunshine, her trademark headscarf firmly in place.

Good day for a gallop: The Queen riding her Fell pony Carltonlima Emma in Windsor Great Park this morning

Although approaching 90, the Queen continues to ride out every morning -Â  a longstanding habit begun when she was given Shetland mare, Peggy, aged four.

Since then, the royal stables have seen a succession of steeds, among them Betsy, a black farm-bred horse who was the Queen's mount of choice in the 50s, and Surprise, a grey gelding whom the Queen famously galloped down the course at Ascot in 1961.

But while her penchant for riding is well known, her career as a racehorse breeder is legendary and spans more than 60 years.

Beginning with the handful that she inherited on the death of her father George VI, the Queen's horses have since triumphed in more than 1600 races, including all five British Classics, with the exception of the Epsom Derby.

The Derby, which takes place on Saturday, has so far eluded the Queen, although she did have a second place finish in 1953 and managed third place in 2011.

Along with Royal Ascot, the Queen never misses a Derby meeting and will be at the race on Saturday, where she will, in keeping with tradition, congratulate the winner from the royal box.

While the Derby has so far eluded her, the Queen has bred some of the finest horses ever to race in the UK, among them Dunfermline who managed to win both the Epsom Oaks and St. Leger Stakes in 1977, Carozza, who triumphed in the Epsom Oaks in 1957 and Pall Mall who took the 2,000 Guineas in 1958.

Last year, her filly Estimate romped home to take the prestigious Gold Cup at Royal Ascot -
 much to the delight of the monarch.

Despite her love of racing, the Queen no
 longer rides her mettlesome thoroughbreds herself or, indeed, any of the more spirited breeds occupying the royal stables.

Instead, much of her time is devoted to breeding docile Fell ponies, among them her current mount, Carltonlima Emma, from the royal stud at Hampton Court.

The Investec Derby is part of the QIPCO British Champions Series and will be broadcast live on Saturday 7th June by Channel 4 Racing. Visit britishchampionsseries.com for more information.

Ancient: The stocky Fell pony has roamed British vales for more than two millennia

One of the oldest equine breeds on the planet, Fell ponies like the Queen's mount Carltonlima Emma, have roamed the moors of Cumbria since the Neolithic period.

Docile, hardy and thick-set, the majority of Fell ponies are black, grey or bay and measure between 13 and 14hh.

Highly prized by the Carvetii, the Iron Age tribe who occupied the region more than two millennia ago, the ponies later caught the eye of the invading Romans and were used as trade goods all over the Empire.

The Romans also helped develop the breed into the relatively large animal it is today. Originally thought to have stood around 12hh tall (similar to Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies), by the end of the Roman period, the average Fell was more than a hand higher.

Another invader to fall in love with the Fell pony was the Vikings, who used the animals as pack ponies; a use continued by the Normans.

By the 13th century, the Fell's usefulness as a pack animal was well-established and the pony played an important role in British trade until the end of the 18th century.

Following the Industrial Revolution, Fells were used to transport iron ore and coal from mine to town, as well as underground when the height of the shaft allowed.

Although previously used in trotting races, the Fell pony really came into its as a riding horse in the 1950s, when its gentle nature and pretty looks made it the pony of choice for families.

Today, the pony remains a popular choice for riders of all ages, among them the Queen who breeds Fell ponies from her Hampton Court stud.
