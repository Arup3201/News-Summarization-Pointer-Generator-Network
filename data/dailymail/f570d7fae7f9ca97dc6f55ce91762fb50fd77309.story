Controversial businesswoman and outspoken commentator Katie Hopkins has taken on mothers doing school runs in her latest rant, saying they are 'bitches because their lives are so boring'.

Speaking in light of the guilty conviction of two British school mothers who were arrested for assault following a brawl at the gates of their children's school, Katie took part in a debate with journalist Angela Mollard on Australia's MSN news service, Mornings on Channel 9.

Discussing the conviction, Katie - known for her controversial opinions and outspokenness - said it was no surprise to her that the mothers had been brawling, especially given that groups of women are instinctively unkind to one another, and that the lives of 'school run mums' are so monotonous.

She said: 'Having too many women in one place is never going to be a good thing, is it?

'And they're always going to fight. I don't know what the collective noun for mums is - a mob? a gaggle? - but too many is going to cause tension.

Angela Mollard says Katie Hopkins is guilty of exactly the same 'bitchiness' she sees in other mothers

'A lot of that is because their lives are pretty boring: they go from the school gate, to coffee mornings with same mums, and back to school gates, and if that's all you do in your life you're going to want to have a scrap every now and then.'

Angela said she thought Katie was wrong, and that there is, in fact, a real sense of camaraderie between school gate mothers.

She said: ' I think this is a fabrication. You get colonies of women everywhere, but if Katie's having an 
experience of bitchy school mums it's a reflection of the messages she 
sends out herself.

'I've never experienced it. I have a positive 
experience with all the mums in my school.

'I've seen people support 
each other through cancer, death, problems with children... to paint it 
as a catfight is just wrong.'

Katie countered that she felt school 
gate bitchiness was intrinsically cliquey, adding: 'If you share enough 
of your problems, if you have enough cancer, if you have enough death, 
you're one of the mob, you fit in.

'But if you work, if you have interests, then you're hated with a passion and a fury.'

Speaking
about her own daughters Poppy and India, she said: 'If there's one 
thing I want to inspire my girls to do it's to work hard and look beyond
the school gates... and not do that drop off more than they have to.'

Angela then retorted that Katie is guilty of the 'bitchiness' herself, but in a more public forum, commenting: 'When
you say you don't like children with ginger hair, and you don't like 
names like Tyler, and that women are slackers, and then you steal 
another 
woman's husband and you boast about it... aren't you guilty of that very
bitchy behavior you're critiquing in other women?'

Katie said she was simply reflecting their behavior back at them, but in front of a camera.
