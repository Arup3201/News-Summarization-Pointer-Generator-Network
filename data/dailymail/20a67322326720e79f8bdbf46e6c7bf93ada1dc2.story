Reluctant: Pope Francis said he 'did not want' to become the head of the Catholic church

Pope Francis has admitted that he didn’t want the job of leading the world’s 1.2billion Catholics.

Asked about his choice of career during a visit to a Jesuit school, he replied: ‘Someone who wants to be Pope does not really like themselves. I did not want to be Pope.’

In Vatican etiquette it is considered bad form for a cardinal to reveal ambitions towards the top job.

During conclaves tradition dictates that any cardinal who obviously wants to be Pope will not be elected.

Pope Francis also explained why he turned down the chance to live in the luxury papal apartments, saying he needed to ‘live with people’. 

‘It’s a personality problem. I need to live with people. 
If I lived alone, I would feel a bit isolated and it wouldn’t be good 
for me,’ he said. 'It would be bad and boring.'

He added: ‘A professor asked me about this and I told him "Listen professor it’s for psychiatric reasons".’

Since his appointment Francis has eschewed the decadent lifestyle of the
Vatican, continuing to wear a simple white cassock and iron cross, and 
his scuffed black shoes instead of papal red.

Even when an archbishop in Buenos Aires he lived in a one bedroom apartment and travelled by public transport.

Humble: The Pope does not live in the luxury papal apartments and chooses to wear simple clothes and shoes

His predecessor Benedict XVI hinted several times that he had not wanted to be Pope before his dramatic resignation in February.

He once said he had prayed to God not to be elected but that ‘evidently this time he didn’t listen to me’.
