A leafy village was today named as the second worst burglary hotspot in Britain.

Apperley Bridge in West Yorkshire is runner-up in a table of 20 districts based on research into insurance claims.

Yorkshire features prominently, with areas of Leeds and Bradford particularly vulnerable.

The picturesque village came second only to Stoke Newington in north-east London.

Burglary hotspot: Apperley Bridge in West Yorkshire is runner-up in a table of 20 districts based on research into insurance claims

Dubious distinction: The inhabitants of Stoke Newington in north-east London make the most burglary-related insurance claims in the country. It is one of six London postcodes on the list

The trendy postcode where shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and her husband Ed Balls have their home is named Britain’s worst for burglaries.

It is one of six London postcodes on the list.

Stoke Newington has in recent years developed a reputation as an up and coming area thanks in part to its regular organic farmers’ market and car boot fairs devoted to vintage goods.

It has a hugely diverse population, including large Asian, Irish, Turkish, Jewish and Afro-Caribbean communities.

The research was based on quotes sought by more than three million consumers using the moneysupermarket.com price comparison website.

Applicants were asked whether they had made a burglary-related insurance claim in recent years.

The N16 postcode for Stoke Newington, 
which is in the borough of Hackney, came out top with 33.6 claims per 
1,000 insurance inquiries.

Don't forget to lock your doors: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and her husband Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, have a home in Stoke Newington

In
joint second place were the BD10 postcode of Apperley Bridge, Bradford,
and the B71 postcode of West Bromwich, both with 31.7 per 1,000.

The publication of the list risks labelling entire neighbourhoods as under threat from criminals.

But
head of home insurance at moneysupermarket.com Julie Fisher said: 
‘Being in a higher risk area doesn’t necessarily mean where you live is 
bad or rife with crime – many thieves will target more affluent areas 
purely for the rewards on offer.’

She warned that a listing as a burglary hot spot does have financial consequences.

‘Properties
classified as being in a ‘high-risk’ area – whether that be for crime, 
or something like flooding or subsidence – could see the price of cover 
affected,’ she said.

‘Unfortunately there is no escaping this and to make matters more complicated, there are no hard and fast rules which apply.’

She called on insurers to adopt a more sophisticated measure of risk to better tailor premiums to individual households.

‘Most
insurers have a blanket approach when it comes to assessing postcode 
districts for home insurance premiums, but this really needs to change,’
she said.

'If houses are 
evaluated on a case by case basis it would mean homeowners received 
quotes at the best possible prices based on their individual 
circumstances.

Rife with crime: The postcode of Wood Green (above) in north London had the fourth most burglary-related insurance claims per 1,000 insurance inquiries

‘Homeowners 
need to be extra vigilant when it comes to security – installing timers 
on your lights and ensuring items of value are kept away from your 
windows are easy steps to take to reduce risk.’

Lights 
should be set on timer to come on and off at different times of the
day in order to give the impression that the house is occupied.

Other simple measures include installing good locks and home
security systems.
