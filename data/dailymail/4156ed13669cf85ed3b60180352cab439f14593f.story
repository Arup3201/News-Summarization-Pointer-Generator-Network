England second row Dave Attwood will line up against New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday following the birth of his first child.

Attwood's participation in the QBE Series opener was in doubt due to a delay in his fiancee Bridget going into labour.

However, the Bath forward left England camp on Tuesday afternoon to be at his partner's side and later confirmed on Twitter that the baby had been delivered.

'Massive thanks from everyone. @briewhelan was a superstar. Everyone is doing amazingly well. Couldn't be happier,' Attwood said on his official Twitter account.

After rushing off to attend the birth of his child, it was expected that he would only make the bench for Saturday's game. 

However, it now seems as though Attwood will partner Courtney Lawes in the second row against the All Blacks with the uncapped George Kruis of Saracens offering cover from the bench.
