The boss of the French company that made millions by selling faulty breast implants to women including many Britons was yesterday jailed for four years.

Jean-Claude Mas was found guilty of aggravated fraud after he hid the sub-standard nature of the material used in their production.

The 74-year-old’s firm PIP caused a global health scare when the industrial-grade silicone gel in  the implants led to abnormally high rupture rates.

Poly Implant Prothese founder Jean-Claude Mas arrives at court in Marseille: He was yesterday jailed for four years for hiding the true nature of the sub-standard silicone used in his company's breast implants

Some 47,000 British women and 400,000 
in 64 other countries were affected – although Mas denied the implants 
posed a serious health risk and referred to any claimants as ‘money 
grabbers’.

Mas was also 
fined £62,000, while four other PIP executives were given lesser 
sentences at yesterday’s hearing in Marseille – the biggest and most 
expensive trial in French history.

There were cheers in court as the 
verdict was read out, while hundreds of others joined a protest against 
Mas outside.

Fears spread across the globe in 2011 after French health authorities advised 30,000 women to have PIP implants removed.

Thousands
questioned how Mas, a former meat and Cognac salesman, was allowed to 
cheat health inspectors to make untested implant gel with no concern for
women’s health.

Christine Michelini, 52, a French witness, said: ‘We 
were cheated physically, psychologically and morally, I just want him to
explain to us why he did it.’

Documents relating to the case are seen in the courtroom, left. PIP implants, like the one pictured right, were sold to some 300,000 women around the world until a global panic erupted in 2011 when authorities in France recommended patients with them should have them removed due to an abnormally high rupture rate

British victim Jan Spivey, said before 
the verdict: ‘We want to see some accountability at long last. We have 
high hopes that France will bring justice for British victims.’

She
said the evidence that emerged should ‘shame and embarrass’ the British
Government. Health ministers failed to support British victims to the 
same degree that their French counterparts were backed by their own 
authorities, she claimed.

Lawyers
are now pursuing claims on behalf of thousands of British women who 
have yet to receive compensation.

One solicitor, Kevin Timms, said the 
private cosmetic surgery industry also needed better regulation to 
prevent problems in the future.

Rajiv
Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic 
Surgeons, said: ‘There can be no way of compensating the victims of PIP 
for the scale of this betrayal, and in that respect no sentencing can 
ever be adequate punishment.

‘Whilst
there is no way for regulation to prevent criminal behaviour, 
undoubtedly the system failed  hundreds of thousands of women 
worldwide.’

The hearing is the first of three trials expected to involve
PIP, which at one stage was the world’s third biggest supplier of 
breast implants.

There were cheers in court as the verdict was read out, while hundreds of others joined a protest against Mas outside.

Many UK women are continuing to fight 
for compensation after having the implants fitted - many of whom who 
have had to pay for removals or replacements out of their own pockets.

Richard
Langton, a lawyer from Slater & Gordon, which is representing more 
than 200 British women, said: 'We have hundreds of clients treated by 
many UK clinics who fitted the now banned implants, but unfortunately 
many of the clinics do not have insurance and are unable to meet any 
judgement.

'There will be a trial in October next year against solvent clinics who continue to deny liability.

'Slater
& Gordon have devised a negotiated settlement agreement with all 
the banks to pay compensation to women who used a credit card to pay for
the surgery.

selling faulty breast implants

Some of the hundreds of women who registered as plaintiffs are seen arriving at the trial on arrival at the temporary courthouse. More than 5,000 women who received PIP implants joined the trial as civil parties 

'This will
be small consolation for women who didn’t use a credit card. We are 
also actively pursuing a claim against TUV, the German company who were 
supposed to be monitoring PIP in France and who failed to spot the fraud
that was being perpetrated.

'Now
that the criminal trial in France is over, we can hopefully pursue a 
claim in England if at all possible on behalf of women who would 
otherwise go uncompensated.'

PIP was shut down and its products 
banned in 2010 after it was revealed to have been using industrial-grade
silicone gel, which seemed to cause high rupture rates.

Fears spread globally late in 2011 after French health authorities advised 30,000 women to have PIP implants removed.

Mas,
who has two £1million properties in the South of France and Luxembourg,
was at one stage the third biggest global supplier of breast implants.

According
to various government estimates, over 42,000 women in Britain received 
the implants, more than 30,000 in France, 25,000 in Brazil and 15,000 in
Colombia.

Looking relaxed: Mas, former head of PIP, smokes during a court break on the first day of the trial against him

Thousands 
questioned how the former meat and Cognac salesmen was allowed to cheat 
health inspectors to make untested implant gel with no concern for 
women's health.

Christine 
Michelini, 52, a French witness in the trial, said: 'We were cheated 
physically, psychologically and morally, I just want him to explain to 
us why he did it'.

Ms 
Michelini, from Caen, in Normandy, was fitted with a PIP implant after 
cancer treatment and was operated on numerous times before finally 
having the implant removed.

The hearing which ended with a guilty verdict today is the first of potentially three trials involving PIP.
