The mother of a one-year-old Maryland boy found dead inside a backpack in an Ohio creek pleaded guilty Friday to involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering.

Dainesha Stevens, 25, is trying to take responsibility for her own inaction when a male friend of hers beat 14-month-old Cameron Beckford, according to her defense lawyer Mark Collins.

The man, who has not been charged,was trying to rid the toddler of demons, the lawyer said.

Mother Dainesha Stevens, 25, pleaded guilty Friday to involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering

Fourteen-month-old Cameron Beckford was found dead in Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, Ohio in 2014

The little boy wasn't found until New Year's Eve, but he was badly beaten on Christmas and left the next day 

The man believed Cameron had demons and beating him was the only way to get rid of them, Collins said.

Stevens agreed to cooperate and be truthful in any proceedings against that man, who is expected to be indicted and face prosecution in Franklin County, Collins said.

Collins said: 'It was the first step for her taking responsibility for her inactions... and not doing more to protect her child.'

She also has a seven-year-old daughter named Cheyenne.

The father of Stevens' two children reported them missing after she had fled to Columbus in mid-December to stay with her friend Kurt Flood.

Stevens may receive a 12-year prison sentence 

Columbus police found Cameron's body on December 31 in Big Walnut Creek.

Flood was held on an unrelated misdemeanor charge after the body was found and has not been charged in relation to the child's death at this time.   

The coroner said the boy had bruises on his lower back, kidneys and lungs, and bruises and scarring on his buttocks.

His mother initially told police she left the boy on a stranger's porch but later changed her story, directing police to the creek and providing more information about the man who had beaten her children. 

The man injured the toddler on December 25, and when Stevens found the boy unresponsive the following day, they put his body in the bag and left it in the water nearby, Collins said. 

The prosecution and defense are recommending a 12-year prison sentence for Stevens, whose sentencing is scheduled July 23. 

She would be eligible to seek judicial release after nine years if she has no problems in prison, Collins said. 

Cheyenne also reported being beaten by the man and is now back in Maryland with her father.
