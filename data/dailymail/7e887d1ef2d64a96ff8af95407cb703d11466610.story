The British fashion expansion into the Far East is gathering pace, with Whistles opening branches in Hong Kong and China just days after Topshop and Smythson also stuck their flags in local groud.

The elegant high-street label, a home-grown favourite of both the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron that was founded in 1978, already has shops in Paris, Berlin, Munich and Moscow.

Moreover, Whistles' expansion into Asia is, perhaps, a preamble to a further expansion in the opposite direction: the brand is currently in discussion with a large American department store about opening a concession in spring/summer 2014.

The expansion will see 'shop in shops' opening in August in two key Lane Crawford department stores: one in Hong Kong, the other in a newly opened Shanghai site.

The brand will be situated in the contemporary area and will carry products from the catwalk show as well as best selling leather, cashmere and silk pieces. The collection will also be available at Lane Crawford online.

The move sees the next phase in the brand's wholesale expansion strategy, the first phase of which saw it showcase the AW13 collection for the first time at London Fashion Week to international press and buyers.

Increased demand in online sales from Asia - and a boom in buyers from the region shopping in the brand's European stores - prompted the expansion.

Whistles chief executive Jane Shepherdson told Vogue.com: 'We realised that the brand appeals to the Chinese aesthetic, in that it is feminine, but with a clean, modern feel.

'China is an increasingly sophisticated market, and there seems to be a growing middle class customer, who doesn't necessarily want to only buy into the luxury labels - but also wants to shop contemporary European brands that provide well-designed quality fashion at a price that they can afford.'

Founded in London in 1978, Whistles began as an independent boutique and has since evolved into a leading womenswear brand, characterised by its contemporary, intelligent sense of style and design.

The Duchess of Cambridge, Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears, and Prime Minister David Cameron's wife Samantha Cameron are and staunch supporters of the brand, but Sheperdson says film director Sofia Coppola is their style muse, and their 'go-to woman for inspiration'.

The former Kate Middleton and her sister Pippa both have wardrobes full of Whistles clothes, and the Duchess is not afraid to show her thrifty side by recycling them: last summer she wore the £150 blue Bella dress to both the Diamond Jubilee Concert and the Olympic Games Closing Ceremony.

Despite the clothes Kate wears selling out moments after she is photographed wearing them, Sheperdson denies the so-called 'Kate Middleton effect' has boosted sales.

Speaking in 2012, she said: 'It raises profile, it’s great, we get known in countries we're not known in. But it's not going to turn us into a success overnight because she wears it.

'Fortunately, she looks great in it and it's a great advert, but no more than that.'

Earlier this month British fashion chain Topshop opened 
its first Hong Kong outlet today, becoming the latest Western brand to 
brave the city's astronomical rents in a bid to crack the lucrative 
China market.

Topshop
 boss Philip Green cut the ribbon to the 1,300-square-meter 
(14,000-square-foot) shop with the help of Taiwanese actress Gwei 
Lun-mei.

Green said he wants to use the store, located in the city's central business district, as a 'stepping stone' to mainland China.

He's looking for possible locations in Beijing and Shanghai to open 'flagship' stores.

Other
 foreign retailers that have launched recently in the Asian finance 
center include U.S. brands Abercrombie & Fitch, Tommy Bahama, 
Forever 21 and Victoria's Secret.

Foreign
 brands have been lining up to open showcase boutiques in Hong Kong as 
they try to get a share of the spending by the increasingly affluent 
consumers visiting from mainland China, the world's second biggest 
economy.

The demand 
has helped drive up shop rents in Hong Kong, a former British colony 
that's now a special administrative region of China.

And last week luxury British stationary and
 leather goods house Smythson - proud owners of three Royal warrants, 
and with clients including the Royal family and Madonna - opened a standalone shop in Hong Kong.

The 
125-year-old company dispatched former creative director Samantha 
Cameron - who still both advises and, on occasion, represents the brand -
 to the Far East, to cut the ribbon at Smythson's new branch.

The brand already have a concession 
in Harvey Nichols in Hong Kong, but the new boutique marks a step up for
 the company which last year witnessed saw turnover rise to
 £24.5m in the year to March, up from £20.2m a year earlier.

Samantha
 was joined by editor-in-chief of Vogue China, Angelica Cheung, who had 
hosted a dinner and several with David and Victoria Beckham earlier in 
the week, as well giving several talks alongside Victoria to fashion 
students in China.

The 
new boutique is housed in Pacific Place in the Admirality district, and 
reflects the style and intrinsic British identity of the brand, as found
 in the company's London flagships in New Bond Street and Sloane Street.
