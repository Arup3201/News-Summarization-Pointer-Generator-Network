Safe passage: Switzerland has revealed it would shield Edward Snowden from extradition to the U.S.

Switzerland would shield NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden from extradition to the U.S. should he agree to assist the country with an investigation into American spying, it has been revealed.

The former intelligence contractor could be granted safe passage to travel to Switzerland without fear of being handed over to the U.S., according to a leaked document drawn up by the Swiss public prosecutor's office that outlines the country's legal options were Snowden to visit.

The 'purely hypothetical' situation relies on Snowden agreeing to cooperate with a Swiss criminal investigation into U.S. spying activities he claims to have learned about while working in Geneva.

According to the document, which first leaked last week but was shown to the Reuters news agency by the Swiss prosecutor's office today, Snowden would probably not be extradited to the United States if Washington asked.

It explains that Switzerland could not comply with the request if Snowden is accused of treason or divulging state secrets, because such charges have a 'political character' under Swiss law.

The guarantee for Snowden's free passage in Switzerland could only be trumped by 'higher state obligations' such as a treaty, the document said - adding that this area required further study.

Upon showing the document to Reuters, the prosecutor's office stressed the issue was 'purely hypothetical' because
Snowden had not been invited to come from his current refuge in
Russia.

The office refused to make any further comment on the document, which was leaked last week and prompted a lively
debate in the Swiss media.

Marcel Bosonnet, Snowden's lawyer in Switzerland, did not comment on the document. 

Tension: The leaked public prosecutor's office document could spark a clash between the respective presidents of Switzerland and the U.S., Didier Burkhalter (left) and Barack Obama (right)

Although Snowden is likely to be granted safe passage should he travel to Switzerland, his chances of political asylum there are low as he has already been given a three-year residency in Russia.

The decision on whether to grant Snowden asylum in Switzerland ultimately lies with the government and with justice officials. 

Snowden worked as a computer technician for the CIA in the U.S. mission to the United Nations in
Geneva between 2007 and 2009.

He has previously stated that he had a 'formative'
experience in the Swiss city when the CIA deliberately got a
Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home.

When he was arrested, a CIA operative offered to intervene
and later recruited the banker, Snowden has claimed. Some Swiss
officials have questioned if the incident ever happened. 

Split: Snowden is a hugely divisive figure in the U.S., with many arguing his whistleblowing risked lives. Others, such as the anti-NSA protesters pictured, claim he was right to reveal the extent of state surveillance

Discussion of Snowden's potential movement outside Russia has not been limited to Switzerland.

Some German politicians have suggested inviting him to the country to testify about NSA spying there,
but Berlin has already ruled that out to avoid a clash with Washington
over his extradition. 

Michael McCaul, Republican head of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security, reacted angrily to the Swiss debate over Snowden's future.

He told the U.S.-based Foreign Policy magazine
that Snowden should not be allowed to 'trade our intelligence
community's sources and methods for safe haven in other
countries'.

Switzerland would protect Snowden from U.S. if he assists spy investigation

@highlight

NSA whistleblower's cooperation would render extradition a political issue

@highlight

Would therefore not be handed over to U.S. unless a treaty was in place
