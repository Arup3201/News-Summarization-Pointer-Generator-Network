Fiona Wardrop used to be a 132kg, mother-of-three with a self-esteem that was at rock bottom.

Having battled with her weight since the age of 10, she's transformed herself from a size 26 to a size 6 after losing 84kg.

But it all came at a cost as the 32-year-old had to tap into her superannuation to pay for two of her surgeries.

The mother-of-three used to be 135kg and says she's been overweight since she was a child

Going under the knife was the last resort for Ms Wardrop, of Wattle Grove in south-west Sydney, who had tried all methods of diets you could name.

'I've always been big so I knew nothing else,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I tried everything. The diet shakes and the diet pills but I always gave up too early. Exercising was always part of my life but that didn't work either.'

That life she once knew was taking a toll on her physically and mentally.

'In one sitting I could consume one to two pizzas and would have at least two litres of coke a day. Salad was out of my vocabulary,' Ms Wardrop said.

'On the outside, I was a confident and loud person but behind closed doors I hated myself and my body.'

But one day she woke up and realised she could no longer live the way she had been for the last 20 years.

So in 2012 she decided to finally do something for herself.

'I didn't realise how big I was until I looked at myself in photos,' Ms Wardrop said.

'I knew this was the time for me to do something for myself because I was embarrassed to be around my husband and my kids.'

So came the decision to undergo a sleeve gastrectomy, a potentially life-threatening surgery which cost about $10,000 in September 2012.

'It's a surgery which removes about 85 per cent of the stomach so yes there was a high risk involved,' she said.

'I decided to do it because I knew this was it for me and because I didn't have the money I used my superannuation funds to pay for it.'

But even after going from 135kg to 51kg, Ms Wardrop felt unhappy with her significantly reduced reflection.

'I felt like a man because I went from a G cup to having no breast tissue and there was a lot of skin to cut away,' she said.

So the second phase of Ms Wardrop's transformation came when she met plastic surgeon Dr Barnouti Laith in 2013.

'He's the one who changed me,' she said.

That's when she opted for a tummy tuck, breast implants and lift which cost a total of $23,000.

'After the surgery I was finally been able accept myself,' Ms Wardrop said.

'But by then I'd cleared out my superannuation.'

And it's a decision that she doesn't regret.

'This has added 20 years to my life,' she said.

'I see my reflection now and I think "wow I can't believe I look like that". 

'I feel younger, healthier and happier. I can run around with the boys and I can keep up with them.

'It's the best feeling and now I can stand proud next to my husband and kids.' 

Ms Wardrop says she couldn't have done it without the support of her three kids and husband Steve. 

So become an improved version of herself, Ms Wardrop decided to renew her vows in July.

'I did it because I've always wanted to look like a princess on my wedding day and that's exactly how I felt,' she said.
