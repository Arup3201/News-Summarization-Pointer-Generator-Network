Malcolm Myatt always looked on the 
bright side of life. But the grandfather is now in a permanent state of 
happiness – after a stroke left him unable to feel sadness.

The
stroke interfered with the part of Mr Myatt’s brain that regulates 
emotional responses, leaving him liable to erupt in a fit of giggles at 
the most inappropriate of times.

He
has sat through funerals smiling broadly or cracking jokes, and during 
meals out with wife his Kath, 63, he regularly attracts puzzled looks 
from fellow diners.

Malcolm Myatt (pictured with his wife, Kath), 68, was left with little feeling in his left side after he suffered a major stroke in 2004. Until he had the stroke he was fit and healthy

But while the condition could be devastating for some, Mr Myatt said yesterday he sees his joyous disposition as a blessing. 

The 68-year-old said: ‘I’ve always been a happy person and loved telling jokes, but now I don’t ever feel sad.

‘I remember that I used to be able to feel sad, if something bad happened – but it just doesn’t happen any more.

He added: ‘I would definitely rather be happy all the time than the other way round.’

Mr
Myatt was healthy and working as a lorry driver when he was struck down
with the stroke in January 2004 as he made breakfast.

Doctors told Mr Myatt, and his wife, that the stroke had hit the frontal lobe of his brain that controls emotions, and the couple realised it meant he could no longer feel sadness

Mr Myatt said: 'I am never depressed. Being sad wouldn't help anything anyway. I would definitely rather be happy all the time than the other way round. It's an advantage really'

Mr Myatt spent 19 weeks in hospital after his stroke and his wife was told to prepare for the worst. He realised he was unwell when he tried to carry a cup of coffee upstairs and spilled it

It affected the right frontal lobe – 
the part of the brain that controls  emotions and motor function on his 
left side – and doctors initially feared the grandfather-of-two would 
not pull through.

Mr 
Myatt, from Cannock, Staffordshire, spent 19 weeks in hospital and has 
no function in his left arm and  can only walk short distances with the 
aid of a stick.

The pensioner is now in the early 
stages of vascular dementia, triggered by a reduced blood flow to the 
brain following the stroke.

Mrs
Myatt and the couple’s daughter, Beverley Lloyd, 31, yesterday said  Mr
Myatt’s condition meant he was unable to curb his happy persona, and 
sometimes left them feeling like they were living with a child.

Mr Myatt's short term memory has also been affected by the stroke and he has lost his ability to judge what is, and what is not, an appropriate thing to say. (Pictured with wife Kath on their wedding day.)

But
while the condition can be trying at times for the family, they said 
the couple’s grandchildren, Aaron and Dominic, can’t wait to visit their
‘hilarious’ granddad.

Mrs Myatt added: ‘Malcolm doesn’t cry, he just doesn’t know how to be sad anymore. 

‘But he’s infectious. When he starts laughing everyone in the room does.

‘We have been to funerals and I’ve been on tenterhooks wondering what he might come out with.’

Dr
Clare Walton, research communications officer at the Stroke 
Association, said: ‘While we haven’t heard before of stroke survivors 
completely losing the ability to feel a particular emotion, many find it
very difficult to control their emotions and may cry or laugh at 
inappropriate times.’
