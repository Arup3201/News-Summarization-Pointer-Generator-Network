A photo series shows the physical transformation and aging of a group of four sisters over four decades.

The images, taken by Nicholas Nixon, are currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in the exhibit 'Nicholas Nixon: Forty Years of the Brown Sisters.' The exhibit runs through January 4.

Nixon first photographed the four women - including his own spouse - in 1974 but did not like the way the photo turned out, a page for the exhibit says.

Nixon told The Guardian last month 'The series grew out of boredom. We’d go down to visit [my wife] BeBe’s parents on weekends. 

Sisters: Nicholas Nixon first photographed Heather, Mimi, Bebe and Laurie in 1974 but did not like the way the photo turned out. The next year, though, he did like a picture he took of the siblings. The 1975 photo is seen here

'It was kind of boring, a lot of socializing, we were expected to show up for dinner every day... Out of a friendly desperation, I said: ‘Let’s take a picture.'

Nixon liked a 1975 picture he took of the siblings, however. Mimi was 15, Laurie was 21, Heather was 23, and Brown's wife Bebe was 25, the MOMA's exhibit page says. Nixon has two children with Bebe. 

'It was after this second successful picture that the group agreed to gather annually for a portrait, and settled on the series’ two constants: the sisters would always appear in the same order—from left to right, Heather, Mimi, Bebe, and Laurie—and they would jointly agree on a single image to represent a given year,' the exhibit page explains.

 'We are all aware of time passing and us not being aware of it while it’s passing,' Nixon told The Guardian. 'So seeing the sisters, for a lot of people, gives them a reliable marker that a year has passed.'

Nixon spoke about the photo series with The Huffington Post last August.

He said at the time 'It didn't really get serious until the next year [1975], the year of Laurie—the woman on the right's—college graduation. And that's when I took the second one, and kind of on a whim, said let's do it in the same order. 

'So it was having two pictures in my hand, and the year space between them that gave me the idea that it would be really interesting to do it forever. And so I asked them if we could. And they all laughed at me and said sure.

'We joke about it. But everybody knows that certainly my intention would be that we would go on forever no matter what. To just take three, and then two, and then one. The joke question is what happens if I go in the middle. I think we'll figure that out when the time comes.

Being an only child, it was really gratifying and lovely to be embraced by this family. There's still a ground water of affection, and support. I look back at these thirty-some pictures and it's like they're of my sisters. I can feel myself getting old with them. And I'm part of them; they're part of my love.'
