More than 43 million Americans are expected to head to a holiday destination, making it busiest travel day of the year, but the weather forecast could affect those plans.

Almost 39 million or 90 percent are expected to travel 50 miles or more from home by motor vehicle, according to AAA projections.

However, meteorologists are predicting rain and a sudden drop in temperatures that could lead to a possible nor'easter for next week.

Forecast: An East Coast storm scheduled to arrive on Thanksgiving is threatening to create travel chaos for millions of Americans

Bearing the brunt: It appears as though the Eastcoast and Midwest are in for a shivery few days

Having already experienced November temperatures colder than most for the last few years, brace yourself - there are are several heavy doses ahead.

The first Arctic blast will arrive this weekend with another by turkey day.

Abnormally cold air will plunge into the Midwest and Northeast and there could well be a snowstorm on Turkey Day.

The storm is expected to bring a lot of rain to the Northeastern United States.

Monday: A nor'easter is swirling together and it could hit the east coast just in time for Thanksgiving

Tuesday: The storm looks like it will stretch from New England down to the Carolinas, bringing snow, wind, cold, and rain along with it

Wednesday: It's a particularly dreary picture for Cape Cod. The area could receive hurricane-like gusts of wind

Thursday - Turkey Day: Given the storm's current trajectory, the nor'easter is expected to strike sometime between Tuesday evening and Thursday, during the busiest travel days of the year

Chilly outlook: Arctic blasts and a developing storm are making for a frosty reception during Thanksgiving

The storm could bring strong winds and heavy rain to much of region, with snow possible, especially in higher-elevation areas in eastern Pennsylvania and northwest New Jersey.

Those traveling for the holiday could face delays on the road and at airports and train stations.

Forecasters say it's still too early to tell exactly how much precipitation, or what type, to expect in specific areas.

At this point, forecasts say the Interstate 95 corridor in the mid-Atlantic is more likely to see a 'chilly rain,' instead of snow, according to AccuWeather.

The storm system is on track for the Northeast, with some initial rain and low clouds moving up past Washington D.C., by late Tuesday.

Although it will not be a crippling snowstorm for holiday travel, it has the possibility of making air and road trips more difficult.

The storm will for the most part be gone come Thanksgiving Day in most areas, but an impending cold front should still leave snow on the roads.

Predictions: Forecasters are warning Thanksgiving travelers to beware, as a sweeping winter storm system could bring icy roads, flight delays and more headaches to the holiday next week

Disruption: The Northeast will likely seeÂ¿massive flight delays on Wednesday in all major airports, because of rain, snow and low-lying clouds that wreak havoc with flight plans

On its way: The system has already brought freezing rain, sleet and heavy snow in parts of the southern Plains and desert Southwest

Predictions: Although it's still six days away, forecasters are predicting there will be travel disruption thanks to a winter storm

November 27 will be the 'busiest single day of travel' with 37 percent of travelers expected to leave for the holiday.

Holiday travelers can be thankful for significantly lower gas prices which have retreated nearly $1 a gallon since the Memorial Day holiday period.

AAA expects prices to remain favorable through the remainder of the ye

'While the economy continues to improve, the sluggish pace of the recovery is creating uncertainty in the minds of some consumers and therefore AAA is projecting a slight decline in the number of Thanksgiving travelers this year,' said AAA Chief Operating Officer Marshall L. Doney.

Good news for drivers this holiday season is gas prices are the lowest for the Thanksgiving holiday since 2010.

'The primary focus of Thanksgiving, more so than any other holiday, is to gather with friends, family and loved ones and celebrate with each other. Travelers attempting to carve out a travel budget will be happy to know that Thanksgiving will be the least expensive holiday of the year,' Doney said.
