Despite being ridiculed when they first appeared, wedged wellingtons have quickly become must-have footwear.

Prima ballerina-turned-Strictly judge Darcey Bussell is the latest famous name to be seen sporting the waterproof boots with raised heel, while walking her dogs earlier this week.

The wedge boot has the Queen’s seal of approval, too, with Royal warrant-holder Hunter selling its own version.

The Royal warrant-holder Hunters sell wedged wellies, right, for £115, but the Queen, left, has not been spotted wearing them yet, preferring to stick to the flat-heeled variety...for now

As well as Bussell, celebrities 
snapped wearing the funky footwear, known for their leg-lengthening 
properties, include Kerry Katona, Tulisa, Sadie Frost, Halle Berry, 
Nancy Del'Ollio and Katie Price.

The
style first came to the fore in 2010 when a group of entrepreneurs 
pitched the idea to BBC2’s Dragon’s Den, receiving an impressive £65,000
investment from retail guru Theo Paphitis, who hailed their designs 
‘practical and stylish’.

Their WedgeWelly brand now 
boasts a massive range of colours, sizes and patterns, including a 
wide-calf version and a shorter Chelsea-boot style.

The shiny black Legend Unique boot, selling for £40 a pair, was the one favoured by Strictly’s Darcey.

Hunter’s all-black Melrose Tall Wellington costs £115, while the high-heeled Fulbrooke Tall Wellington is yours for £125.

In fact, they’re so stylish, it seems a shame to let them get covered in mud.
