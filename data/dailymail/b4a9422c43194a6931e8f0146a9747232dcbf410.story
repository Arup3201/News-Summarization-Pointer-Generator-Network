Women over 40 are being refused free IVF on the NHS as doctors ignore official guidelines.

An investigation has revealed that just four out of 211 GP-run Clinical Commissioning Groups are funding this treatment. 

In February the health watchdog NICE said IVF must be available to all women aged 40 to 42 – as well as lesbian couples.

The advice sparked controversy as treatment costs £4,000 a time and research shows only about 17 per cent women of this age fall pregnant, and about half of those suffer miscarriages.

The British Medical Journal used Freedom of Information requests to reveal that the majority of organisations ignore the advice.

It also showed that many of the newly-created CCGs are rationing treatments to save money.

In NHS Mid Essex, hernias are only treated if they are growing every month or are very painful.

In February the health watchdog NICE said IVF must be available to all women aged 40 to 42 ¿ as well as lesbian couples.

Elsewhere, NHS Stafford and Surrounds CCG and NHS Cannock Chase CCG have policies to reduce hospital referrals for muscle, bone and joint problems.

Dr Jerry Luke quit as clinical director of NHS Crawley CCG in West Sussex, warning: ‘They have only one real duty, and that is to end the year in budget. Everything else is secondary to that.’

Dr Chaand Nagpaul, a GP in Harrow, North-West London, said patients were ‘at the mercy’ of a postcode lottery where chances of getting treatment were dependent on the CCG’s budget.
