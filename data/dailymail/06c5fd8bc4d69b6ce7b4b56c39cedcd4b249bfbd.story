Men of the Strip star and former Chippendale dancer Nate Estimada was reportedly being treated for depression before he committed suicide by driving his car off a cliff near Los Angeles earlier this week.

The 24-year-old, known by his stage-name 'Midnight Cowboy,' was killed after his car plunged 400ft off a cliff and into landfill on Wednesday.

Police have said they believe the young star took his own life, and are waiting for toxicology reports to see if there were drugs in his system at the time. However, those close to Estimada say he was battling depression prior to his death.

Kind-hearted: Friends have paid tribute to Estimada, who was described as loving and charming

TMZ cites 'multiple sources' who say evidence of Estimada's depression was visible during his final performance in Boston last week.

Those close him say there clearly was something wrong with Estimada, but he 'wasn't receptive to talking about it with his co-stars.'

One of his fellow dancers reportedly said told the rest of the cast that he was battling depression and had sought treatment - and 'he was just having a rough time dealing with things.'

Authorities say Estimada drove his Ford Mustang off the steep cliff on Wednesday, just days after his friends say they noticed something was off.

Estimada, who had recently joined the Men of the Strip show had previously worked with the world-famous Chippendales in Las Vegas.

Friends and co-stars were quick to pay tribute to the young star who was described as having a big heart.

On Thursday, a tweet from the official Men of the Strip Twitter account paid tribute to Midnight Cowboy.Â 

'Management
 & cast of Men of the Strip is extremely saddened at the loss of one
 of our own. Cast member Nate,' the tweet read.

'The cast and management of Men of the Strip thank you for your heartfelt condolences and expressions of love and support.'
