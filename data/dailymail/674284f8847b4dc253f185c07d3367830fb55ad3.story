Brendan Rodgers is no stranger to spending time with the Royals having spent a year in charge at the Madejski Stadium, but on Tuesday evening the Liverpool manager came face-to-face with the real Queen of England.

Rodgers was attending an event at St James' Palace in London which marked the 80th anniversary of Diabetes UK. 

He was joined by his 19-year-old daughter Mischa, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of seven.

The Queen is a patron of the charity, which was founded as The Diabetic Association by HG Wells and Dr RD Lawrence, and therefore attended the event where she met the Anfield boss.

The 42-year-old and his daughter shared a few words with the monarch before shaking her hand. 

Rodgers said: 'An event like this shows the seriousness of diabetes - if someone like the Queen is patron of the charity and is celebrating the work at that it does.'
