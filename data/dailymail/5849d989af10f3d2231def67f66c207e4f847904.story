Pastygate: David Cameron became embroiled in a pasty tax fiasco yesterday when he was apparently caught telling fibs about his love of the hot snacks. He is pictured eating a pastry-based product in 2010

David Cameron became embroiled in a pasty tax fiasco yesterday when he was apparently caught telling fibs about his love of the hot snacks.

The Prime Minister spoke out following public anger at the Chancellor’s decision to slap a 20 per cent VAT surcharge on hot pasties sold by high street firms such as Greggs.

He boasted that he loved Cornish pasties in order to seize a public relations advantage after critics accused the Government of being out of touch with ordinary people.

But his claims, at a Downing Street press conference, that he last ate a pasty at an outlet of the West Cornwall Pasty Company at Leeds station were quickly exposed as untrue. Network Rail revealed the West Cornwall outlet was closed down in March 2007 – five years ago to the month.

And in further embarrassment for the PM, it emerged that a Cornish Bakehouse pasty booth on the northbound platform of the station was closed down on Friday – two days after the tax increase was announced.

The Prime Minister’s alleged ‘porky pies’ were quickly branded ‘Pastygate’ in Westminster and provoked a feeding frenzy of exchanges.

Mr Cameron was forced to speak out after anger caused by George Osborne’s appearance before the Treasury select committee on Tuesday. The Chancellor told MPs hot pasties that are cooled down before they are sold would not be subject to VAT, while hot pasties would be – and said he could not remember eating a Greggs product.

Mr Cameron made an impassioned defence 
of the plans, arguing they would create a level playing field between 
bakers and pasty outlets, which are currently VAT exempt, and other fast
 food joints such as McDonald’s and fish and chip shops, which have to 
pay the tax.

But he was caught out when he gave an 
overly detailed account of his last pasty meal. ‘I’m a pasty eater 
myself,’ he said at an event about the Olympics. ‘I go to Cornwall on 
holiday. I love a hot pasty.

‘I think the last one I bought was from the West Cornwall Pasty Company. I seem to remember I was in Leeds station at the time. The choice was to have one of their small ones or their large ones. I’ve got a feeling I opted for the large one and very good it was too.’

But within minutes Network Rail had confirmed that Mr Cameron’s memory was faulty.

Tory MPs privately compared Mr Cameron’s gaffe to that of Tony Blair, who was dogged for years by the apocryphal story that he claimed to have seen the Newcastle footballer Jackie Milburn play, when he had retired when Mr Blair was four years old.

Labour raced to cash in on the Government’s embarrassment. Ed Miliband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and treasury spokesman Rachel Reeves all attended a photo opportunity at a Greggs bakers in Redditch, Worcestershire.

Labour aides gleefully told 
journalists that Mr Miliband bought eight sausage rolls for £4.70 – 
which will cost £5.64 when the tax is imposed in October.

Mr
 Miliband said: ‘The Government is now putting 20 per cent on the cost 
of pasties, sausage rolls, and the Chancellor’s excuse? Well, he says 
you can buy them cold and you can avoid the tax. It just shows how out 
of touch this Government is and it shows that we’ve got a Budget that is
 hitting millions of people while cutting taxes for millionaires.’

More
 than 2,000 people signed a No 10 petition calling for ministers to axe 
the tax and a company began selling T-shirts bearing the slogan Don’t 
Tax My Pasty.

Downing 
Street officials rushed to assure the nation that while Mr Cameron may 
have been caught out on the details, he is a firm pasty fan. ‘It’s a 
near ritual on trips that the PM and his aides have an end-of-day pasty 
on the train back,’ one said.

Pasty
 makers called on ministers to change their plans. Gavin Williams, of 
the West Cornwall Pasty Company, thanked the PM for his endorsement but 
added: ‘We would have hoped that if he had been rubbing shoulders with 
our customers he’d better understand the impact that this move will have
 on them, and our sector and all the great suppliers within it.’

Why the change?

In the 1980s Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson put VAT on hot food. But he exempted freshly baked products, such as pastries and pies, that were still warm from the bakery oven. George Osborne considered this a loophole that needed closing.

What food is covered?

All food – pasties, sausage rolls, toasted sandwiches and rotisserie chickens – that is sold hot in any shop will have to charge the 20 per cent sales tax. Hot takeaway restaurants and fish and chip shops already charge VAT.

What’s the official definition of ‘hot’?

The Treasury guide says food is hot if it is ‘above ambient air temperature when provided to the customer’. This seems pretty straightforward – until you consider the British weather, which has great variations in temperature throughout the year and in different parts of the country.

So a sausage roll sold at 20c in summer would be below the ‘ambient air temperature’ and VAT-free. In the winter it would be warmer than the surrounding air and therefore liable for VAT.

Equally perverse, if it was a hot and sunny day in the South and cold and wet in the North, customers would, in theory, pay different prices for the same sausage roll.

To take this to its most absurd, someone waiting at the front of a queue for a fresh sausage roll might pay VAT because it is still hot, while someone at the back might pay less because it has gone cold.

How will the taxman determine how much of the food sold is hot and how much cold?

One possible solution is that revenue inspectors will consider factors that affect ‘ambient temperature’, such as local weather patterns and seasonal changes, and make a one-off annual assessment of what proportion of hot and cold items  a shop will sell over the period of  a year.

They might decide, for example, that 60 per cent of sales are hot and 40 per cent cold. The retailer would then be given a VAT bill based on this calculation.

How have takeaway food firms reacted?

Sales at bakery chains such as Greggs and Subway have soared in recent years. But the new tax will mean many prices rising by 20 per cent and not surprisingly they are trying to force the Treasury into a rethink.

They say food that is freshly baked on the premises and sold while still cooling down should continue to be free of VAT. It says these products should be treated differently tax-wise from food like burgers and kebabs which are designed to be served hot.

Are there other practical difficulties?

Bakers, supermarkets and even corner shops might need to spend extra money on new cabinets to keep separately hot items (which are VAT liable) and the same  cold product (which doesn’t attract VAT).

Are there exemptions to the hot food tax?

Yes. Freshly-baked bread (which is considered a basic food item) will not carry VAT.

However, tax accountants predict a raft of court cases involving battles over the  exact definition of freshly- baked bread.

For example, a loaf is easy to identify – but what about croissants, scones, pain au chocolat and other such products?

How much will be raised from this extra VAT?

Officials say the changes (which come into operation on October 1) will raise £50million in the current financial year, rising to £120million in 2016/7.
