Ladies, if you're tired of torturing your feet with stilettos and platformers, things may finally be going your way.

According to those in the know, high heels are on their way out - with 'ugly flats' set to be all the rage this spring.

Moulded, comfortable sandals have already been showcased on catwalks and cheaper versions are now appearing on the high street.

Isabel Marant's Holden sandal, retailing at a cool £280, is said to the holy grail of footwear this summer

For those with the money, the holy grail of sensible shoes is said to be Isabel Marant's Holden sandal, retailing at a cool £280.

With their flat brown sole and two wide strips of padded leather, they may look fairly unremarkable.

But demand is now so high that many stores have sold out - with opportunists selling them on eBay for as much as £380.

Helen Attwood, shoe buyer at Selfridges, told The Times: 'It's the shoe of this season.

'It sold out in black and brown as soon as it arrived in store and that was before the sun started shining.'

Ida Petersson, of Net-A-Porter, added: 'We unveiled them in December and they had sold out in the US almost immediately and everywhere else within weeks.'

Phoebe Philo at Céline reinvented the classic Birkenstock-style sandal 18 months ago

Fashion experts say the trend for flat, 'ugly' shoes began when Phoebe Philo at Céline reinvented the classic Birkenstock-style sandal 18 months ago.

Birkenstocks, which have a contoured sole, were first manufactured in Germany in 1964 and then later in California.

They became popular all over the world because of their orthopaedic benefits, especially with those working on their feet all day.

Recently, demand for the classic sandal soared after being championed by presenter Alexa Chung, and model Stella Tennant.

Hannah Rochell, the features editor at InStyle magazine, said: 'The Isabel Marant Holden sandals are basically Birkenstocks for die-hard fashionistas that can't quite bring themselves to wear actual Birkenstocks.'

For those on a budget, Sole Trader is selling Birkenstock Relax sandals in black for only £27.99.
