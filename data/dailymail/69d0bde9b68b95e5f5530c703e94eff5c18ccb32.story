Claim: Author Patti Davis, pictured last summer, has claimed that her mother, former first lady Nancy Reagan, supports gay marriage

Though her late husband may have had an embattled view of same-sex marriage, Nancy Reagan fully supports it, her daughter has sensationally claimed.

Patti Davis, the daughter of the former first lady, announced in a radio interview this week that her mother ‘does’ support it.

Davis’ claim directly goes against an op-ed written by her half-brother, Michael Reagan, who claimed earlier this month that legalizing gay marriage would lead to ‘polygamy, bestiality, and perhaps even murder.’

Speaking on SiriousXM’s show, ‘OutQ,’ Davis was asked whether her mother supported the progression. The former first daughter responded simply: ‘She does.’

Two weeks ago, she again made headlines for making a posthumous claim that former president Ronald Reagan would also support same-sex marriage.

Davis also spoke out on her half-brother’s piece, condemning it as ‘ugly.’

‘It’s all such ugly stuff…But there are other people who feel this way and who lump gay people in with people who have sex with donkeys and farm animals.

Speak for yourself: Nancy Reagan, pictured last year, is now 91; Davis said she wanted to be careful about speaking for her mother

‘That is just horrific. Our father would in no way tolerate that kind of ugly talk and that kind of hateful speech.’ Davis was on the program to speak about her upcoming novel that is about a romance between lesbians, entitled ‘Till Human Voices Wake Us.’

Though Davis never spoke to her father about gay marriage before he died in 2004, Davis told the New York Times that he would have ‘been puzzled’ by the force with which government was intruding into people’s private lives.

Davis herself has a complicated relationship with her mother, now 91.

As the Huffington Post notes, the two were estranged for some time, only reconciling after former President Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease in 1994.

Earlier this month, Michael Reagan, a political consultant, called on church leaders to stand up and fight against same-sex marriage. 

'It’s ultimately about changing the culture of the entire country,' he wrote in the Ironton Tribune.

Dire warning: Michael Reagan, son of former U.S. President Ronald 
Reagan, warned in an op-ed published earlier this month that legalizing gay marriage
will lead to 'polygamy, bestiality and perhaps even murder'

Legalizing same-sex marriages, he writes, 'inevitably will lead to teaching our public school kids that gay marriage is a perfectly fine alternative and no different than traditional marriage.'

'There is also a very slippery slope leading to other alternative relationships and the unconstitutionality of any law based on morality,' he continues. 'Think about polygamy, bestiality, and perhaps even murder.'

Michael Reagan slams the Republican Party, saying party leaders are too preoccupied with the next presidential election to be concerned about the moral threat that he believes same-sex marriages pose to the country. 

'Where’s the moral outrage?' he asks. 'Why aren’t thousands of our pastors, priests and rabbis shouting from their pulpits? Why aren’t they leading their congregations through the streets in mass protest?'

It's up to churches to 'defend the culture against legalized gay marriage,' he says, but instead religious leaders are 'hiding in their pews.'

'It’s time for the churches to get engaged and start fighting for America, instead of wimping out,' he writes. 'You can't win the fight if you don't put on the gloves.'

Reagan is the eldest son of the former president and he's the author of 'The New Reagan Revolution: How Ronald Reagan's Principles Can Restore America's Greatness.'
