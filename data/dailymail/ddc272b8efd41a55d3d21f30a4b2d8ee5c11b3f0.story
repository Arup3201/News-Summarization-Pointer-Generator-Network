Bethenny Frankel, the reality star turned Skinnygirl mogul, has been accused of setting a bad example to her young daughter after the 43-year-old posted a photo of herself online wearing her 4-year-old’s pajamas.

The former Real Housewives of New York City star posted the photo on Instagram on Sunday of her wearing daughter Bryn Hoppy's Hello Kitty themed sleepwear of ruffled pink top multi-coloured shorts and matching fluffy slippers.

She wrote: ‘This is my daughter's nightgown and PJ shorts. Think we're ready to start sharing clothes yet?’

Bethenny Frankel, the reality star turned Skinnygirl mogul, has been accused of sending a bad message to her young daughter after the 43-year-old posted a photo of herself online wearing her 4-year-old daughter's pajamas

But if the author of a book called Naturally Thin thought she was being funny, many of her followers didn’t agree.

The photo has already attracted more than 600 comments many accusing Frankel of sending the wrong kind of message.

‘This makes me sick to my stomach!!! #eatsomething,’ one commenter wrote.

Another message read: 'Really don't think your sending your daughter a good message. She probably thinks wow my mom's a lot older than me and can fit my clothes, so I must be really big for my age.'

The former reality star tried to make light of the incident via Twitter on Monday and claimed that she had only been trying to make her daughter laugh

Do you see any harm in Bethenny Frankel's photo dressed in her four-year-old daughter's clothes?

‘Starting a complex early for your daughter,’ another commenter added of the pic.

Another message read: ‘I would just 
caution doing this as she gets more impressionable. She needs to develop
 a healthy self-image because she may not have all of your genes…and it 
won't be obvious to you, but it will look as though you are competing 
with her.’

Frankel took to Twitter on Monday morning to defend herself claiming that she was just joking and trying to please her daughter.

The slimline former talk show host, whose divorce from ex Jason Hoppy was finalized earlier this year, has admitted to an unhealthy relationship with food in the past.    

In 2010, she told Redbook magazine that she 'used to get drunk and binge on everything in the deli, and then do a juice fast or starve, then do it all over again.'

Frankel rose to fame via reality TV, first as a contestant on The Apprentice: Martha Stewart and then on The Real Housewives of New York City.

On the back of her celebrity she has 
written several books, including Naturally Thin: Unleash Your SkinnyGirl
 and The SkinnyGirl Dish: Easy Recipes for Your Naturally Thin Life. She
 also created the Skinnygirl cocktail company which she then sold for an
 estimated $100 million

Her talk show, Bethenny premiered last September but got cancelled in February.

Bethenny married Bryn's father businessman Jason Hoppy in March 2010, just two months before their daughter was born in May.

But the union lasted less than three years and she filed for divorce from the 43 year-old in January 2013. Since then, the pair have been involved in a bitter custody battle over the little girl.

In court in May, twice-married Bethenny gave dramatic testimony as reported by Us Weekly.

'Jason said to me, 'Get ready, we are going to war. It's over. We're done,' she claimed on the stand.

'He would hold Bryn, and he would say, 'You're finished, you're done. I'm going to ruin you.'

Thankfully last month lawyers were able to thrash out a custody arrangement both were happy with.

'My client is delighted that this custody dispute has been resolved; that his co-parenting status has been acknowledged; that the parties' child will have the benefit of being raised by both parents; and most importantly, that his daughter will no longer be at the mercy of a high-profile courtroom battle,' Jason's attorney Bernard Clair told MailOnline.

And the mood appears to have lightened between the warring former couple.

'Jason wishes Bethenny only the best of luck, and he looks forward to sharing with her all of the joyous occasions, milestones, and blessings that will be coming up in his daughter's future,' the lawyer added.
