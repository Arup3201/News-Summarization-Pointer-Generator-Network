She is one of the world's most provocative pop stars, but now Madonna could pay the price for 
interfering with Russian politics.

A £6.6 million ($10.5m) court claim is beginning today 
against the singer over her support for gay rights during an August concert in St. 
Petersburg.

A law passed in the city earlier this year makes it illegal to promote homosexuality to minors.

The author of that law has pointed to
the presence of children as young as 12 at Madonna's summer concert.

The lawsuit, brought by a group of activists, orders the singer to explain her comments during the show when she urged the 
crowd: 'Show your love and appreciation to the gay community. We want to
fight for the right to be free.'

The activists are seeking 'moral damages' 
from the star. 

The complaint includes a video taken at 
the concert showing Madonna stomping on an Orthodox cross and asking 
fans to raise their hands to show the pink armbands in support of gays 
and lesbians that were distributed among the audience.

Homosexuality, punished with jail terms in the Soviet Union, was decriminalized in Russia in 1993, but much of the gay community remains underground as prejudice runs deep.

Madonna was labelled a 'moralising slut' by Russia’s Deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin during the row last summer.

He Tweeted: 'With age, every former s. tries to lecture everyone on morality.

'Either take off your cross, or put on your knickers.'

Alexander
Pochuyev, a lawyer representing the nine activists, filed the suit 
against Madonna, the organizer of her concert, and the hall where it was
held, asking for damages totaling 333 million rubles.

In a response to criticism that the complainants were stuck in the Middle Ages, the lawyer said they were using civilized, modern methods to defend their rights.

He told Russian agency, RIA Novosti: 'No one is burning anyone at the stake or carrying out an Inquisition.

'Modern civilization requires tolerance and respect for different values.'

'She (Madonna) had been warned with 
words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it. So
we will speak in the language of money,' said Darya Dedova, one of the 
10 activists who filed the lawsuit in a St Petersburg court.

'Of
course, it is difficult to measure moral damages and suffering but 
maybe people who earn money regardless of moral rules will better 
understand this,' Dedova said. She added if they won the case, the money
would be sent to orphanages.

'Maybe
someone does not see the link but after Madonna's concert maybe some 
boy becomes gay, some girl becomes lesbian, fewer children are born as a
result and this big country cannot defend its borders - for me it 
causes moral suffering,' said Alexei Kolotkov, another of the activists 
who filed the suit.

The 53-year-old had already offended the Kremlin with her support for Pussy Riot.

Earlier this year free speech in the country took a hit when the three members of the punk band were sentenced to two years in prison for a protest outside Moscow's main cathedral against Vladimir Putin and his relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church.

Maria Alyokhina, 24, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, were convicted of ‘hooliganism motivated by religious hatred’ in August, after they burst into a cathedral to protest against Vladmir Putin.

They were sentenced to two years in jail for the stunt, a punishment that many in the West said was too harsh.

A third convicted band member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on appeal when a court suspended her sentence after her lawyer argued that she had been pulled away from the cathedral’s altar before the protest song began.

Madonna spoke out in support of the group during her concert in St. Petersburg and two days earlier in Moscow.

After the verdict was issued, Madonna called on 'all those who love freedom to condemn this unjust punishment.'
