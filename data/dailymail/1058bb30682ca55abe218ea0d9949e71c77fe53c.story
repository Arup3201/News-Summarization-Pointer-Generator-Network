What do a Harlem man, a guy who flew from Nigeria to LAX and thousands of other feverish worrywarts across America have in common?

They've all checked in to hospitals in recent days believing their headaches and nausea could be the dreaded Ebola virus. And they've all been cleared.

Their numbers are also growing. Since Thomas E. Duncan became 'America's patient zero' on September 30, the CDC says its gotten over 800 calls per day from local health workers and other officials desperate to know, 'Does my patient have Ebola?'

Ruch of false alarms: A Harlem man checked into New York's Bellevue hospital on Wednesday over fears he had the dreaded Ebola virus. Doctors later cleared him

In all cases except Duncan's, that answer has been an emphatic no. 

But after the widely panned government response in Dallas to Duncan's diagnosis and thanks to a steady stream of suspected case news stories every day, the false alarms aren't expected to end any time soon.

Los Angeles and New York City have seen two of the most recent of these cases. 

On Wednesday, a Harlem man checked into Bellevue hospital complaining of a fever and was initially treated as a potential Ebola case, according to the New York Post. The man had recently traveled from Nigeria and was suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, but was apparently given the okay.

'There's nobody with Ebola and nobody suspected of having Ebola at Bellevue,' a hospital spokesman told the Post.

The Los Angeles case in Inglewood on Tuesday was actually one of 8 in the county who've been tested, according to KTLA. All tests have come back negative.

Another major city where multiple false alarms have made headlines is Washington, DC, where Ebola was ruled out as a potential cause of illness in a man at Howard University Hospital just days after Duncan's diagnosis.

Around the same time, at nearby George Washington University, a patient was found to have the flu and not Ebola, as was initially feared.

Hands are tied: The CDC says any potential Ebola patient is someone with a fever who's recently traveled to West African nations currently dealing with the Ebola outbreak, so hundreds or even thousands of people in America have become--if ever so briefly--suspected cases since 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan was diagnosed Sept. 30

A third Washington-area patient, in the suburb of Rockville, had Ebola ruled out as a possibility that very same weekend.

On Wednesday, an American Airlines flight landed at Midland airport in Texas and passengers filed out wearing masks after a passenger 'exhibited one symptom of the Ebola virus on a flight from Dallas.'

She too, experts ruled, is Ebola-free.

According to Forbes.com's math using CDC's numbers, some 5,000 Ebola false alarms have been sounded since Duncan was diagnosed.

As news of Duncan's Wednesday morning death was still breaking, another potential Ebola case--and potential false alarm--came out of Texas.

A deputy sheriff who entered the Dallas apartment the Liberian occupied while he was ill checked in to a Frisco, Texas hospital Wednesday afternoon exhibiting 'signs and symptoms of Ebola.'

Sgt Monnig's son, Logan Monnig, told CBS that his father had woken up with 'stomach issues' and had gone to the clinic as a precaution.

Logan said family were told by the CDC that their father was not at risk of the virus, as he had only been in the apartment for 30 minutes and had not come in contact with bodily fluids.

'We are not expecting him to' test positive for Ebola, said Logan. 

Widespread fear: Centinela Hospital in LA County had a 'potential Ebola patient' on Tuesday who turned out to be another false alarm, one of 8 in the county thus fay
