West Ham new-boy Diafra Sakho has made an instant impact at Upton Park, scoring three goals in four games, for the Hammers.

Here Sportsmail takes a look at Upton Park's current hero.

There wasn't a big song and dance about him signing was there?

No, he slipped under the radar somewhat. He arrived from Metz for just £3.5million. If he carries on the way he'll prove one of the bargains of the season.

What are his attributes?

Certainly his pace. The forward's rapidness caused Liverpool's defence major problems on Saturday and West Ham's rivals can expect more of the same. His versatility and directness will be key for the Hammers, with the Senegal international able to play anywhere across the forward line.

Did he have any other summer suitors?

Newcastle, with their strong knowledge of French football, were interested in the Sakho, but Sam Allardyce beat his former club to the punch.

The deal nearly fell through, however, when the Hammers tried to change the structure of the deal, forcing Metz to release this strongly worded statement: 

'The English club unilaterally decided to propose a loan deal with an option to purchase instead of a permanent deal, which does not correspond to FC Metz's expectations and contradicts all the terms that had been agreed last week between the two clubs.

'FC Metz regret this clear lack of respect, which is unacceptable, from West Ham towards FC Metz and also the player. As a result, FC Metz reserve the right to approach the international sport court and assert their rights and defender their interests.

'FC Metz had released Diafra Sakho from his professional duties during matchday 1 of the Ligue 1 championship by giving him leave to take a medical in England to complete the last stage of the deal.'

Three in four is a good return, what's his goal record like?

Not bad, he's scored 40 goals for Metz in his previous two seasons. They were all out of the French top-flight, though.
