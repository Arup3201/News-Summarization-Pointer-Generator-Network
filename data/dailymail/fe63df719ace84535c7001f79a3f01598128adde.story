The likelihood of Roger Federer competing at the French Open appeared to increase on Tuesday night after he announced that wife Mirka had given birth to twins.

The world No 4 had pulled out of the Madrid Masters earlier in the day in anticipation of the possible arrivals and confirmed their birth on Twitter.

He wrote: 'Mirka and I are so incredibly happy to share that Leo and Lenny were born this evening!'.

Ready to pop! A heavily pregnant Mirka Federer, right, was pictured sitting with fashion editor Anna Wintour at the Sony Open in Florida in March. The couple did not reveal they were expecting twins for a second time

The Swiss, who already has four-year-old twin girls, said at the Monte Carlo Masters last month that he would have no qualms about missing any tournament, even the French Open, to ensure he was at the birth.

Federer said on his Facebook page: 'I’ve decided to withdraw from Madrid to be with my wife Mirka during these next few exciting weeks for our family.

'I apologise to my fans and hope to be back in Madrid next year. I’ll be training near my home, and am excited to rejoin the Tour soon!”

But with Roland Garros still 19 days away, Federer’s chances of appearing at the year’s first grand slam have surely increased, although he seems likely to miss next week’s Rome Masters.
