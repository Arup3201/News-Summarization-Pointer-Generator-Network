Prime Minister David Cameron has been warned that he will foster division in the party if he ignores the views of eurosceptics

David Cameron was branded ‘absolutely out of touch’ with the Tory party last night after he dismissed calls to give Parliament a veto over EU law.

The Prime Minister was told he risked causing disastrous divisions in the party, including a Cabinet split, after a letter from 95 backbenchers demanding the right to say No to European legislation was branded unrealistic.

Eurosceptics reacted furiously last night, saying the Prime Minister would be ‘bonkers’ to ignore their views and warning that Tory high command was heading for an ‘almighty smash-up’ with the rest of the party.

The row is expected to intensify on Wednesday when Chancellor George Osborne makes a speech arguing that Britain should remain within a reformed European Union.

The number of rebels calling for a veto on new EU laws – and the power to repeal existing ones that threaten Britain’s national interests – dwarfs the 81 MPs who voted against the Government on Europe in 2011.

The letter was signed by almost two thirds of the 158 backbenchers not given jobs by Mr Cameron.

The rebels say at least six Cabinet members also back them, plus six ministerial aides and members of Mr Cameron’s policy board, making the true figure 107 MPs or more.

One signatory said: ‘If Downing Street digs in over this they are absolutely bonkers. They will create a Cabinet split. This is a wake-up call. If the governing elite of our party are so absolutely out of touch it’s going to be absolutely disastrous.’

At the moment, Mr Cameron can only veto new laws on the most sensitive issues such as defence and the EU budget. But while Parliament can raise concerns with the European Commission, it has no powers to block or repeal existing laws.

The rebels call on Mr Cameron to ‘make the idea of a national veto over current and future EU laws a reality’ and ‘enable Parliament to disapply EU legislation, where it is in our vital national interests to do so’.

The MPs point out that this ‘would transform the UK’s negotiating position in the EU’ as Mr Cameron seeks to carve out a new relationship with Brussels ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017.

William Hague says the unemployment will soar and the UK economy will be hit hard by a veto

But Foreign Secretary William Hague warned the veto would undermine the single market and damage business.

He told Sky News: ‘If national parliaments were unilaterally just able to choose which bits of EU law they would apply and which bits they wouldn’t, the European single market wouldn’t work. We have to be realistic.’

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he understood the MPs’ concerns but a ‘red card’ system could work only if several  countries got together to oppose EU laws.

Bernard Jenkin, who co-ordinated the letter, said europhiles overestimate the economic damage that could be caused if the Uk renegotiates its relationship with the EU

He added: ‘I don’t think it’s realistic to have a situation where one Parliament can veto laws across the European Union.’

But irate MPs accused senior Tories of peddling a policy that was ‘indistinguishable from that of the Liberal Democrats’.

They warned Mr Osborne not to use the argument advanced by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg – that leaving the EU could cost three million jobs – when he speaks to the Open Europe think-tank and the Tory Fresh Start group on Wednesday.

The Chancellor is expected to urge EU nations to change their economic approach to copy Britain’s growth, but signal that the UK wants to stay in if the EU reforms itself.

Bernard Jenkin, who coordinated the letter, said: ‘We’re all being very polite to each other but I think it’s better if we have some honest disagreements on the future of Europe rather than pretending we agree.

‘It’s the facile tactics Europhiles always use. They start talking about three million jobs as if the sky is going to fall in if we ask for some powers back.’

Jacob Rees-Mogg, another signatory, said many rebels don’t even want the single market, adding: ‘If this makes the single market not work, that’s not the problem. We can still have free trade, which is more important. Laws should be made by our democratic representatives, not by the fiat of Brussels.’

Signatories include James Clappison, Conor Burns, John Baron, Anne Main and ex-defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth. One said: ‘Downing Street’s argument is such rubbish. We are at crunch point. They are heading for the most almighty smash-up.’

They said Mr Cameron had nothing to lose by making the veto Tory policy because the pro-European wing of the Tory Party was so depleted. One added: ‘Would the party be split? I don’t think so.’

Europe's ‘travelling circus’, in which MEPs decamp to France once a month, costs taxpayers at least £93million a year.

European Union figures show the astonishing price of packing up the parliament in Brussels and shipping it to Strasbourg for just four days each month.

Conservative MEPs estimated the true cost to be £130million – and called for an end to the practice.

Some £250,000 is spent just lugging paperwork between the two cities, a report on the ‘financial and environmental impact’ showed.

Maintaining the parliament in Strasbourg costs £50million a year.

Although MEPs voted to scrap the ‘circus’ by three to one last year, the French will veto any such attempt.

Conservative MEP Ashley Fox said: ‘This craziness has to stop.’

Jacob Rees-Mogg says the UK doesn't need the single market, as free trade is more important

Mr Clegg warned the letter showed the Tories were drifting towards the exit in Europe, which would lead to ‘economic suicide’ for Britain.

He said the Tory signatories were ‘cowering behind the cliffs of Dover’, adding: ‘Conservative MPs need to make up their mind. If they want full exit from the European Union, they should be free to argue it, but then they should come clean because what they’re saying is they want to be part of a European club but don’t want to play by the rules.’

A No10 spokesman said: ‘We will study this idea, but we need to look at what it would mean in practice. If national parliaments unilaterally overturned EU laws, the single market wouldn’t work.’
