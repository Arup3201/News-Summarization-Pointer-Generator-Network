Deputies in Florida say an 81-year-old man picked thousands of tangerines - 11 truckloads worth - and then sold the stolen bounty at a nearby market.

Herman Southall was charged Wednesday with 11 counts of transporting citrus without a certificate, grand theft of more than 2,000 pieces of citrus and trespassing. 

He is being held at the Polk County Jail on an $8,500 bond.

Suspect: Herman Southall is accused of stealing eleven truckloads of tangerines then selling them 

Southall was able to sell the fruit on Tuesday for over $300, according to deputies, The Orlando Sentinel reported. 

Southall and another man were found by deputies Wednesday picking fruit in a Dundee grove after a Sheriff's Office helicopter pilot saw them.

It's unclear if he has retained an attorney.

Deputies say the two had picked more than four rows of Sunburst tangerines.

The report said they were preparing to load the fruit into Southall's truck.

The Orlando Sentinel, citing a copy of the report it obtained, said Southall had claimed to authorities he 'talked to someone several years ago' regarding the fruit collection and was unable to provide contact information.

Deputies said in the report that Southall also presented false proof of purchase documentation, according to the newspaper.

There were over 2,000 tangerines recovered at the time of his arrest, they also reportedly said.
