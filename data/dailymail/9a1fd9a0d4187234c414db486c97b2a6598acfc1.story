Disturbing behavior: Chad Monroe, 34, was charged with stalking and unlawful posting of a message online after his ex-girlfriend complained to police that the man has vowed to make her life a living hell by posting nude photos of her on Facebook 

A Michigan man was charged with stalking after police said he posted nude photos of his former girlfriend on Facebook with the intent of driving the woman to suicide.

Chad Monroe, 34, of Bay City, was arraigned last week on counts of misdemeanor stalking and felony unlawful posting of a message online.

When interviewed by police, the man allegedly informed them that his lawyer had told him that he had the right to disseminate naked photos of his former girlfriend online.

The suspect was ordered held on $35,000 and barred from having any contact with his ex-girlfriend.

According to arrest documents obtained by The Bay City Times, the unnamed woman went to the local police department July 31 to complain about her ex-boyfriend, telling officers that Chad Monroe has been harassing her over the phone - even though she had his number blocked - and sending her messages on Facebook.

The former girlfriend reportedly said that Monroe vowed to make her life a living hell until she killed herself.

The 34-year-old Bay City man allegedly posted the woman's nude pictures on Facebook and labelled her a 'whore.'

According to court documents, one of the images that was uploaded onto the social media portal was a 'Wanted Dead or Alive' poster featuring the victim.

Although the social media site deleted the lewd images, some users had saved them, according to the victim.

The woman's mother told police that she too had received nude photos of her daughter from Monroe, who promised to destroy the woman and drive her to suicide.

Mr Monroe allegedly threatened to continue spreading the X-rated photos of his former paramour online until she returns some of his possessions. 

A week before she went to police for help, the ex-girlfriend had filed a personal protection order against Chad Monroe, which the man dismissed as a mere 'piece of paper.'

When police contacted Monroe and asked him to come down to the station for questioning, the 34-year-old refused, saying that it was his ex-girlfriend who has been harassing him over the phone.

Monroe reportedly sounded a defiant note, telling officers on the call that there was nothing they could do to him because the personal protection order has not been served to him.

‘I talked with my lawyer and he said I can put naked pictures of (her) on the Internet and I am going to keep doing it until she gives me my (expletive) back,’ he said, according to court records.

‘There's nothing you can do about it. I am staying up in Pinconning with my crazy aunt and she will shoot anyone who comes onto her property.’

But despite Monroe's self-assurance, on August 12, a warrant was issued for his arrest and the following day the 34-year-old was arraigned on two criminal counts. He is due back in court next Tuesday.
