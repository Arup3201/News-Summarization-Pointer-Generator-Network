Lying in ruins in the desert after years of neglect and war, this is the airport that never took off.

Gaza's window to the world, Yasser Arafat International Airport, was built in the southern city of Rafah  in 1998 with millions of dollars in foreign grants.  

Egypt, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Germany and other European Union countries all contributed, with Moroccan architects designing the buildings' mosaic walls. 

Desolate: Gaza's international airport was meant to a powerful symbol of the Palestinian state that never was, and opened by then U.S. president Bill Clinton

In ruins: Yasser Arafat International Airport has been bombed several times by the Israelis, and is now at the centre of peace negotiations

This month the stricken airport was one of the negotiation points in the truce talks that failed in Cairo

It was meant to a powerful symbol of the Palestinian state that never was, and opened by then U.S. president Bill Clinton.

And when it did, Gazans were euphoric, gathering at its gates in the thousands to watch the first Palestinian Airlines flight land. Tens of thousands of passengers used it.

But within three years it was closed.

When violence re-ignited, Israel bombed the control tower, then the runway, and finally the elegant Moroccan-designed terminal. The airport became unusable.

In December 2001, Israeli armored bulldozers into more than a dozen pieces, in response to an attack that killed four Israeli soldiers 

Then Israeli F16 jets bombed the airport's radar centre and exterior camera security system.

Amid ongoing hostilities between Israel and Hamas, Gaza’s dream of its own international airport is sinking even further away

Gaza International Airport has become a desolate space with three empty buildings since Israel bulldozed many of its structures

What is left is a pile of rubble.

For years, Palestinian leadership continued to push for the airport's re-opening, emphasising economic loss from its closure.

But Israeli officials cited security concerns, and argued that the airport only benefitted high-flying diplomats and VIPs, offering no contribution to the larger Palestinian economy.

Gazans who can afford it have to travel through checkpoints and border crossings, sometimes for days, to get to airports in Israel, Jordan and Egypt.  

However, this month the stricken airport was one of the negotiation points in the truce talks that failed in Cairo.
