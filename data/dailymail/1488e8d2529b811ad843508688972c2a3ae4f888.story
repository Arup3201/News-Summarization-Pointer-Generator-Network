Dame Jenni Murray, who presents Woman's Hour, now says having a damehood is useful

She once feared that accepting a damehood would make her a traitor to her class.

But Jenni Murray now says that the honour has its advantages.

The Woman’s Hour presenter, who was born in Barnsley, admitted she uses her title to get reservations. She joked: ‘It’s very useful if you want to go to a posh restaurant.

‘I don’t phone myself, well I do, but I pretend I’m not myself. I say, “Hello, I’m calling on behalf of Dame Jenni Murray” and put on this slightly high-pitched voice.

‘And it’s very good for getting a table,’ she said while taking part in BBC2’s Celebrity Antiques Road Trip. 

Just three years ago she wrote about ‘all the reasons to have said “No”’ to the honour and her fears it could have been ‘a terrible mistake’.

But while taking part in Celebrity Antiques Roadtrip, she joked that it did have some advantages. 

In 2011 she wrote in the Radio Times that she hesitated ‘for a heartbeat’ before accepting the damehood.

She added: ‘It was only then I thought of all the reasons to have said “No”… Was I making a terrible mistake?

‘Had I become a traitor to my class by rushing headlong into the bosom of the Establishment? ‘Should I, like the poet Benjamin Zephaniah, be repulsed by anything that had the word Empire in it and which, for him at least, recalled the days of colonialism and slavery?’

Her letter concluded that accepting the honour was worthwhile as it proved wrong critics of her feminist beliefs.

‘Surely it couldn’t be a bad thing for a vociferous exponent of equal rights to be acknowledged by those who, a mere 20 years ago, had sought to silence her,’ she said.

Dame Jenni, 64, took part in the BBC 2 programme as a celebrity contestant against Baroness Oona King, who was paired with antiques expert David Harper.

She and expert Christina Trevanion lost when their items made a loss of £58.84 at auction.

During the programme she also recounted how listening to Woman’s Hour on the wireless with her mother had inspired her radio career.

Just three years ago she wrote about ‘all the reasons to have said “No”’ to the honour and her fears it could have been ‘a terrible mistake’ but has since made admissions that it can have its advantages

‘I think it might have been at that point that I decided that’s what I wanted to do,’ she said.

‘The most exciting moment of my life (was) when they said, “And now Woman’s Hour with Jenni Murray”, and you just went, really? Me? It was a good moment.’

Dame Jenni was born in Barnsley and went to a local grammar school before getting a degree from the University of Hull.

She has presented Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour since 1987. She was given an OBE in 1999 and her damehood in the 2011 Birthday Honours list.

BBC2’s Celebrity Antiques Roadtrip is in its fourth series and is a spin-off from Antiques Roadtrip, which is its ninth series.

It sees antiques experts drive celebrities in classic cars to antiques shops around the country to buy items with a budget of £400. They then sell the items at auction and compete for the biggest profit.
