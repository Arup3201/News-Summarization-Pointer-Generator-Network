Lifelong jazz devotee Clinton was onstage to receive the prestigious Maria Fisher Founder's Award for essential and valuable contributions to jazz education and the jazz tradition.

Herbie Hancock, musician chairman of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, described Clinton, who served in the White House from 1993 to 2001, as one of his 'personal heroes'. 

He said the former president 'has been a jazz advocate for decades and supported the education programs of the Thelonious Monk Institute throughout his Presidency'.

Hancock added: 'He continues to be recognized for his creativity on the tenor saxophone, skills he honed during his youth through public school music programs.'

Throughout his eight years in office, Clinton brought jazz to the White House on several occasions, and also helped enable jazz musicians and students to travel around the world. 

The first In Performance at the White House event of his Administration was an evening of jazz on the South Lawn and at the 1994 Summit of the Americas Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright showcased jazz and the Institute’s musicians before 34 world leaders.
