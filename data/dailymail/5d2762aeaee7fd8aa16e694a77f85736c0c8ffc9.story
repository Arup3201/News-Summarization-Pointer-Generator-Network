One of the first to help the rescue 
attempt at The Clutha was senior Labour MP Jim Murphy, who joined the 
‘human chain’ plucking people from the wreckage and carrying them to 
safety. 

The
Shadow spokesman for International Development had been in a nearby pub
when he was told that a helicopter appeared to be in trouble, and 
rushed to help.  

He
said: ‘When I arrived dust seemed to be coming up from nowhere – out 
the roof, out the door, out the ground almost.  But there was no panic 
and it was very quiet. 

Brave: Labour MP Jim Murphy was at a nearby pub when he heard the helicopter was coming down

‘The
emergency services had not yet got there and there was just an 
instinctive response of everyone who was here to just get stuck in.’

Mr
Murphy, whose shirt showed signs of blood, said: ‘I only did a little 
bit – other people were doing things a lot braver than me.

‘There was debris everywhere. We were just trying to get people out.’

Chaos: He said dust was billowing from the pub when he arrived and debris was strewn everywhere
