A 41-storey-drop ride featuring a tower twice the height of the Statue of Liberty has been named the world's highest roller coaster - a month before it's set to open to the public.

As construction work finally finished on the long-awaited Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom, it was announced the tower atop the 456-foot Kingda Ka ride in Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in New Jersey had broken the record.

Hype around Zumanjaro has been building since rumours about a record-breaking tower ride began circulating in February 2012, with Six Flags bosses announcing their plans last year.

Breathtaking: Zumanjaro will drop brave riders 41 stories at 90mph. At the top, they'll be able to see the skyline of Philadelphia 52 miles away

As the name suggests, the roller coaster is not for the faint-hearted.

The 'drop' is higher than Big Ben and travels
 at speeds of 90mph.

Forty-one riders are hoisted into the sky and then 
rocketed back to earth while Kingda Ka trains launch toward them at 
speeds of up to 
128mph.

Riders will pause for a few terrifying moments at a point twice as tall 
as the Statue of Liberty, allowing them to catch a glimpse of the 
skyscrapers in Philadelphia 52 miles away before gravity plunges
 them back to ground level in less than 10 seconds.

Following the recent topping off of the track, the 
construction, maintenance and engineering teams will now focus on installing
 the lift mechanism, adding the three 
gondolas that will whisk riders to the top of the tower.

Then, after extensive ride testing, inspections and 
certification, the first passengers will be able to board the ride later in May.

The record for tallest tower ride was previously held by the 
400ft Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain near Los 
Angeles.

Talking about ride park president John Fitzgerald said: ‘Zumanjaro solidifies Six Flags Great Adventure’s dominance as the Northeast’s thrill capital.

'You’re going to have folks dropping 90mph.

'You’re
 going to have the Kingda Ka cars racing around them at the same time. 
It’s really going to be fantastic. Fantastic views, but also terribly 
exciting.'

Park spokesperson Kristin Siebeneicher said: ‘It's definitely exciting that we are breaking a world record.'

Mammoth: Each tower will feature a gondola for eight riders, which will help keep queues as short as possible

Meanwhile, the park says this is the last season for its wooden Rolling Thunder roller coaster after more than three decades.

‘There are definitely guests, especially roller coaster enthusiasts, who will miss Rolling Thunder,’ Siebeneicher said.

The park says technology has surpassed the dual track coaster, which opened in 1979 and has become a beloved classic.

Zumanjaro is scheduled to open in summer 2014.

Thrill
 ride developers at Busch Gardens acknowledge that the park's newest 
attraction might not be everyone's idea of a good time.

Falcon's
 Fury opens on May 1, and riders will be seated upright and whisked to the 
top of a 335-foot tower, then the seat will pivot 90 degrees so the 
guest is looking straight down.

That's when the ride plunges in a six-second free fall.

Jeff
 Hornick, director of design and engineering at Busch Gardens, said 
riders will reach speeds of up to 60 miles per hour on the plunge.

'It's
 a different kind of thrill ride than a roller coaster,' said Hornick. 
'It's really polarizing. You're either really going to want to ride it 
or not want to ride it at all.'

Park
 officials say it's the tallest, free-standing drop tower in North 
America as while Luther and Zumanjaro are taller they are both integrated with other rides or buildings.

'Drop
 towers have been popular at theme parks for many years, but what you 
see with Falcon's Fury is the industry's relentless drive for 
innovation,' said Jeremy Schoolfield, editor-in-chief of Funworld 
Magazine.

'Ride designers are always looking for new twists on classic 
attractions, and Fury's pivoting seats certainly fit that bill. Putting 
riders in a facedown position as they drop toward the ground is 
definitely a new take on this type of ride.

Falcon's
 Fury stands alone, and Hornick says guests can see downtown Tampa and 
even St. Petersburg some 30 miles away once at the top.

Guests
 must be 54 inches tall to ride. A circular gondola of 32 seats takes 
the riders to the top of the tower — once there, a computer program 
determines how long the riders will stay at the peak before the 
gut-wrenching plunge.

Hornick said the wait time at the top will be randomised, anywhere from one to five seconds.

'The only thing you're going to hear is your heart beat,' he joked.

On
 the 60 mile-per-hour drop, the seats will be pulled back, to give 
riders a feeling of 'ripping' a parachute cord, said Hornick.

The
 park wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year, he said, 
following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows.

Falcon's
 Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called 
Pantopia that includes new retail and food areas.
