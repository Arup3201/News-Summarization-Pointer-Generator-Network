These stunning images show RAF Typhoons circling over the Grand Canyon en-route to Nevada to participate in Red Flag, the largest and most complex air war-fighting exercise in the world.

With echoes of the elite flying squad in 'Top Gun', the classic film starring Tom Cruise, the RAF will take part in a series of combat missions with other coalition forces to prepare them for war. 

Red Flag was established in 1975 to provide realistic combat training through integrated war fighting. 

It was set up in the wake of the Vietnam War where one US aircraft was being lost for every two enemy aircraft.

Following the end of the war, it was decided that readying pilots for real-life combat would improve their chances of survival. 

In what is viewed as the most technologically advanced combat training exercise in the world, two teams made up of the 'Blue Forces' (friendly) against the 'Red Forces' (hostile) simulate real-life air-to-air and air-to-ground warfare at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada and Alaska's Eielson Air Force Base.

The integration - which is made up of 31 different air forces - helps each force learn about other countries' capabilities and how to work effectively with them in war conditions.

Colonel Tod Fingal, Commander of Red Flag, said: 'We bring all types of forces here both from within US forces, so army, navy and marine corps, but also our coalition partners, because when you bring all of us together and train in that contested environment it gives us the opportunity, if called upon, to achieve war-fighting excellence.' 

For the RAF Typhoons FGR4's, even the 6,000 mile journey to reach Nevada is a complex process. Known as a 'trail', it is possible only with meticulous planning.

Each plane will be refuelled in the air 13 times from a Voyager aircraft as they follow a route over the Azores, Bermuda and the east coast of the USA.

An RAF spokesman said: 'We start planning the trail four weeks in advance and while we've been conducting trails for many years each one is different.

'When we get tasked we plan the route and determine where each air-air refuelling will take place. This then gives us the information we require to obtain diplomatic clearances and to book airspace.

'When trailing fast jets over long distances we need to remain within 90 minutes of a diversion airfield lest we have any problem with one of the aircraft.

'We also have to factor in the sea temperature to ensure that in the unlikely event of a pilot having to eject that they are able to survive in the water for as long as possible.'
