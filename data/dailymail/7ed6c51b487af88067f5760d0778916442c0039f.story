Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Paddy Doherty headbutted his brother in the face twice during a pub fight with two siblings at a wake, a court heard today.

The Channel 4 star attacked Douglas McDonagh while they were drinking at the bar.

Another brother - Martin McDonagh - was initially acting as a peacemaker but snapped after hurtful comments about his son who died 16 years ago, Flintshire magistrates' court heard.

Martin 'lost it' and punched Douglas to the floor - before punching him twice more when he got up.

The court was shown CCTV footage of the pub brawl in The Melrose public house in Shotton, Flintshire, last October.

Martin, 52, and his TV star brother Paddy Doherty,
 the 2011 Celebrity Big Brother winner had both previously admitted 
assaulting their brother during the incident.

Paddy will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court next week on March 6, when he could face jail because the latest attack put him in breach of a suspended prison sentence.

Prosecutor Justin Espie said that 
during the incident Doherty appeared to touch the victim on his face and
 the defendant’s demeanor changed.

'Doherty then head-butts him twice to the face as a result of that he falls to the floor.

'He was dragged to his feet by McDonagh,' he explained.

The
 prosecutor said Doherty continued with his aggressive behaviour towards
 the victim and was seen with his hands in the air trying to approach 
the victim but was prevented from doing so by Martin 
'who appears to be looking after the victim.' 

Mr Espie said that Martin McDonagh had also been hugging the victim. But then he suddenly punched him three times.

Douglas
 was left with a cut around three inches long above the left eye, a 
small cut above the right eye and a small cut to his left ear.

Michael Sopholeous, defending Martin, said that there had been a long running family dispute.

That day they had travelled as a group at the request of their mother to attend the funeral of another family member.

He added that Martin McDonagh was still struggling to come to terms with the death of his own son 16 years earlier.

The defendant suddenly reacted when his brother said to him:  'Your son David is better off in the grave than with you.'

Doherty with Sally Bercow and Ken Livingstone: The court heard there had been jealousy over the success enjoyed by some members of the family while others were struggling to get by

Mr Sopholeous said Martin had never got over the death of his son.

'They were incredibly close. He turned to alcohol for support over the years but that became a problem for him,' the lawyer said.

The lawyer said that the victim had confirmed that he had provoked his brother.

'Emotions were running high,' he said.

There had been some jealousy within the family.

'Part of the family have had some success and parts of the family have struggled along in life. There has been jealousy between those who have had success and those who have not,' he said.

Early days: Doherty in a grab from My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, the television series in which he first became famous

Martin McDonagh had been out of trouble for many years apart from an assault on his wife in 2012.

McDonagh, 52, from Queensferry, was given a 12 month community order by the judge today.

He
 was also given a six month alcohol treatment order after the court 
heard he turned to drink following the death of his son. In addition, he
 is banned from contacting his brother Douglas for a year.
