Facebook has removed the ‘feeling fat’ emoticon from its status menu after an online campaign from activists who complained that it was insensitive to people who struggle with eating disorders.

More than 16,000 people signed an online petition at change.org set up by Catherine Weingarten and the group Endangered Bodies, which seeks to combat ‘merchants of body hatred who turn girls and women against their own bodies’.

Activists associated with the group launched multiple Change.org petitions last month as part of a campaign linked to National Eating Disorders Awareness Week.

‘We’ve heard from our community that listing “feeling fat” as an option for status updates could reinforce negative body image, particularly for people struggling with eating disorders,’ a Facebook spokeswoman said on Tuesday.

‘So we’re going to remove “feeling fat” from the list of options. We’ll continue to listen to feedback as we think about ways to help people express themselves on Facebook.’

Catherine Weingarten, a Catherine Weingarten, a 24-year-old Ohio student who launched the U.S. version of the petition, had written on the petition's page that ‘fat is not a feeling.’

Campaign: More than 16,000 people signed Catherine Weingarten's online petition which called for the 'feeling fat' emoji to be eliminated from Facebook's list of emojis that can be used as status updates

'Scrolling through Facebook the other day, I saw a friend’s status set to "feeling fat," accompanied by an emoji with chubby cheeks and a double chin.

'I think it was supposed to be funny, but seeing this status made me feel angry.

'As someone who has struggled with and overcome disordered eating, I know what it’s like to "feel" fat. I have spent years of my life consumed with negative thoughts about my body, and far too many days starving myself in an effort to lose weight.

'But even worse than the skipped meals and the hours spent obsessing in front of the mirror was the fear of what others thought about me and my body.

'When Facebook users set their status to "feeling fat," they are making fun of people who consider themselves to be overweight, which can include many people with eating disorders.

'That is not ok. Join me in asking Facebook to remove the "fat" emoji from their status options.'

Apology: Facebook released a statement on Tuesday saying that it was ditching the 'feeling fat' emoji for status updates because it could reinforce negative body image, particularly for people struggling with eating disorders

Following Facebook’s announcement, Weingarten told Change.org in a statement: “As someone who struggled with body image, I feel so happy that I am eliminating one form of body shaming hatred on the internet.”

Facebook had previously issued a statement to ABC News that said: 'People use Facebook to share their feelings with friends and support each other.

'One option we give people to express themselves is to add a feeling to their posts. You can choose from over 100 feelings we offer based on people’s input or create your own.'

Mashable pointed out that under 'Safety Resources,' Facebook lists resources in response to the question 'How do I help someone who's posted worrisome things about eating disorders?' 

The 'feeling fat' emoji had been taken down by Facebook early on Tuesday morning EST.
