From Elisabeth Moss' monochrome gown to Christina Hendricks' typically glamorous all-black ensemble, this year's EMMYs was a vintage night for style fans - particularly those with a penchant for Mad Men.

But for every Alyson Hannigan (uncharacteristically getting it spot on in purple Marchesa), there was a Lena Dunham showing off her tattoos in an unflattering gown.

FEMAIL rounds up the fashion winners and losers from last night.

Winners: Mad Men stars Christina Hendricks and Elisabeth Moss triumphed on the fashion front at the EMMYs

WINNERS

Mad Men star Elisabeth Moss looked wonderful in a on-trend monochrome gown with a daring textured skirt, which she teamed with newly blond locks and crimson lips.

Also looking good was her Mad Men co-star Christina Hendricks whose curvaceous figure was set off beautifully by her classic black gown.

Claire Danes, a big winner on the night, also took home a host of fashion plaudits thanks to her daring Armani Prive couture gown.

Teamed with a crimson pout, low key jewels and a perfectly-groomed faux-bob, Danes offered a masterclass in red carpet dressing.

Helen McCrory, wife of Dane's co-star Damien Lewis, was another who made red carpet dressing look easy courtesy of an elegant cream gown that showed off her toned arms and was accessorised with aplomb.

Perfect: Zooey Deschanel stayed true to her quirky style while Christina Hendricks' gown flattered her curves

Beautiful: Kerry Washington in lavishly embroidered Marchesa

Glamour: January Jones made minimal work beautifully for her

Ruffled: Actress Julia Bowen was chic in Zac Posen

Looking good: Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss looked lovely in monochrome while Kelly Osbourne was pretty in red

Chic: Julianna Marguiles looked sensational in white while Rose Byrne daringly bared her toned midriff

Masterclass: Alison Hannigan was pretty in purple while Helen McCrory pulled off a difficult dress with aplomb

Elegant: Claire Danes won over the fashion crowd as well as TV fans with her Armani Prive dress

Another winner was Zooey Deschanel who stayed true to her style roots in a quirky sky blue dress by J Mendel.

Complete with a huge, whimsical bow and split to the thigh, Deschanel's dress was a gamble that paid off in style.

Minimal jewellery and a tiny box clutch completed the look without distracting attention from the show-stopping dress.

January Jones and Kerry Washington, both in nude lace, channelled old-fashioned Hollywood glamour, particularly Washington whose lavishly embroidered Marchesa dress looked (and probably cost) a million dollars.

Rose Byrne was elegant in pale pink floor-sweeping skirt and cropped shell top that offered a glimpse of her toned midriff.

Other winners included Kelly Osbourne, who looked wonderful in crimson, Alyson Hannigan, who was pretty in purple, and Juliana Marguiles who was pretty in a monochrome strapless gown.

LOSERS

Leading the losers was Girls actress Lena Dunham, who sported an unflattering floral tented frock by Prada that didn't fit properly and jarred with the tattoos covering her shoulders.

Fellow Girls star Zosia Mamet also failed to impress fashion critics, plumping for a splotch-print gown that included a curious tiny leather bust patch.

Tats not good! Lena's tattoos clashed with the pretty floral print and the shape did nothing for her figure

Equally baffling was Heidi Klum's choice of a maroon sequinned gown that managed to make her look a little frumpy and squat - no mean feat on a supermodel.

Another who got it wrong was Game of Thrones star Lena Headey whose transparent black dress did absolutely nothing for her figure.

Carrie Underwood was another star whose dress was sheer horror - compounded by the sickly green hue that left her looking sallow.

Michelle Dockery's two-tone Prada gown also left critics confused, although the claret colour did provide a striking counterpoint to her pale complexion.

While Dockery's dress divided opinion, there was no confusion over Paula Abdul. Her hideous gold lame dress left her looking like an extra from Star Wars.

Lena, Zosia, Paula: it might be time to sack that stylist.

Controversial: Michelle Dockery's Prada dress has divided opinion

Unflattering: Heidi Klum in a maroon sequinned dress

Ageing: Kaley Cuoco's claret gown made her look sallow

Ghastly: Zosia Mamet's dress included an odd leather bust patch while Paula Abdul's dress was truly dire

Sheer hell: Julianne Hough and Lena Headey experimented with see-through but it didn't pay off

... where is Carrie Underwood then? I want to see the dress you described. This article is by Ruth STYLES (probably Liz Jones using a pseudonym).

How is Rose Byrne in the winners?! She looks so washed out with that unflattering hair colour and dated make up, the dress is ok but she seems to be desperately sucking herself in and the colour isn't great on her. Kaley Cuoco doesn't look even slightly sallow out that colour is lovely on her!

I loved Claire Dane's dress the most but somehow it doesn't look very good on her. It seems like the straps are too long or something? It's gorgeous from the back, though.

The Good, the bad and the downright ugly.  Kelly Osbourne looks like an all-in wrestler in that frock.  Fat arms and tattoos - not a good look.  Purple hair completes the Halloween picture.  The dress is okay though.

Erm....agree with most of them but is it just me or did they put Kaley Cuoco on the wrong list?

Lena Dunham is far more interested in showing off her vulgar tatts than her other taste disaster, the dress.
