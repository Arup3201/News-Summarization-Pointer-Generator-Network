A family with seven children who are facing eviction from 
their foreclosed home say they have found the 
money to buy it back - but the bank is refusing to sell it until it has heard other potential offers.

Jeanette and Bill Gearing, from Helen, Georgia, claim the bank wants them to leave the house as it would grant them five days in which to accept 
outside offers, potentially profiting from the 
family's loss should someone offer more.

'My family wants to buy our family farm of many years - but because we are in foreclosure, JP Morgan Chase (the servicer) and US Bank (the trustee), two of the largest banks in the US, are refusing to even hear an offer until we have been evicted,' Mrs Gearing wrote in a Change.org petition.

Mrs Gearing added that her seven children, ages seven to 17, and their aunt, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, all live in the her five-bedroom, custom-built home.

'My husband did very well,' Mrs Gearing, 42, told ABC of their 5,500-square-foot home they took a $1.4 million mortgage out on in 2006.

'We worked very hard, obviously. We're just victims of the economy just like everyone else. It affected everybody on all levels,' she said.

With the recession cutting her husband's earnings to a quarter of what he previously made, and finding themselves unable to make their near $7,000 monthly mortgage payments - despite the mother now working as a house keeper as well as a substitute teacher - the couple filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February of 2011.

Five months later in July, their house was foreclosed.

'My husband started packing when we were notified of the foreclosure,' she said. 'I didn't give up.'

Make an offer: A family friend has since offered to buy their house for them for $300,000 after comparing the retail price of surrounding homes, but their bank says they'd rather wait on another offer (file photo)

A family friend came to their rescue earlier this year, offering to purchase the home at its current market value so they'd be able to remain living in it. Over time, they promised to pay this friend back.

Mrs Gearing said the gesture was an overwhelmingly hopeful one with the family unable to imagine finding another home or apartment large enough to house them all.

The family friend, who wished not to be named, made a cash offer to U.S. Bank for the house for $300,000 - a figure which was found by comparing the surrounding homes' current selling price.

Yet U.S. Bank, despite being listed on their foreclosure, said they didn't own the property and were just one of several financial firms that possessed it.

It prompted what the family has now called a 'run-around,' connecting JPMorgan Chase to the foreclosure as well.

'We have tried tirelessly to work with the bank to keep our home, but have been given the run-around by the bank each time - often calling and being forwarded to scores of representatives, none of which say they can do anything to negotiate!' Mrs Gearing writes with her petition that has received nearly 200,000 signatures of support.

'Now, we have managed to find outside financing and are trying to submit an offer to JPMorgan Chase to buy back our home (in cash) ... But JPMorgan Chase, claiming bureaucratic process, is refusing to even hear or consider offers on the property until we have been evicted.'

'In servicing a property, we follow the investors' guidelines to avoid foreclosure when possible and to minimize the loss in the case of foreclosure,' Chase said in a statement to ABC. 'After foreclosure, we seek to sell the home for fair market value.'

While possibly unable to offer much more for the home if asked by the bank, the family say there has been some good news as Chase sent a real estate agent to assess the home's value on Thursday.

On Tuesday of next week, an appraiser is set to visit as well.

The news couldn't home faster for the family as the November 5 eviction date looms.

If it does go through, the family said they will still try and buy the home back but do not want to have to move out and then move back in again.

'Just to do that and move back in? For what reason? Red tape?' she said.

Mrs Gearing says she has since started looking at apartments in the area so her children can continue to attend their schools.

Asked if the family's friend would be willing to pay more for the property, Mrs Gearing said they'd pay only what she called a 'fair' price.
