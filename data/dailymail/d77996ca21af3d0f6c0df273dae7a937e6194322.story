Celtic have been granted special dispensation to sign Manchester City striker John Guidetti.

The Scottish champions tried to sign the 22-year-old Swede on loan just before the transfer deadline on Monday night but part of the paperwork arrived just after midnight.

However, an appeal to FIFA by the Scottish football authorities has succeeded.

Disappointment: John Guidetti has had his loan move from Manchester City to Celtic ratified by FIFA

A FIFA spokesperson said: 'After checking the documentation received and the information contained in the international transfer matching system managed by FIFA TMS, the Scottish Football Association was informed today that the envisaged loan deal may proceed.' 

Guidetti, who joined City from Swedish side IF Brommapojkarna in 2008, spent the second half of last season on loan at Stoke where he mustered six appearances without scoring. 

He had a far more prolific spell with Feyenoord three years ago when he notched 20 goals in 23 appearances.
