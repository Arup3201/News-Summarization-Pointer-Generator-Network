Cradling her Heckler & Koch MP5 rifle, she was once Scotland Yard’s poster girl for the Olympics.

But just months after this picture was taken, Police Constable Carol Howard launched a race and gender discrimination claim against the force, claiming that her career had been held back by bullies.

The 34-year-old firearms officer, who is a member the elite Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) – the same unit embroiled in the Plebgate scandal – has accused a senior male officer of denying her equal opportunities because of her race and gender.

Carol Howard, 34, is suing Scotland Yard claiming racial and sexual discrimination

Her tribunal hearing, due to take 
place next month will also hear allegations of bullying within the DPG. 
The squad protects senior politicians, government buildings and foreign 
embassies in London.

Miss Howard, who has served in the force for ten years, helped safeguard London from terror attacks during the 2012 Games.

She
 was thrust into the spotlight when the Metropolitan Police chose her to
 be a poster girl for a glossy magazine feature on the 10,000 men and 
women on duty during the Olympics, which ran under the headline: ‘The 
Met Police is a force to be reckoned with.’

At
 the time, she was happy to talk about her firearms. When asked how many
 weapons she had, Miss Howard said: ‘Four: the Glock, which is a pistol;
 the Heckler & Koch MP5 rifle; a Taser; and CS spray, which is like 
pepper spray.’

She 
also challenged suggestions that armed police have a bad reputation, 
saying: ‘It comes down to public perception. A lot of people who say 
they’ve had problems with the police haven’t actually had a personal 
incident, it’s just something they’ve heard about.’

But
 yesterday it emerged that she has been pursuing a discrimination claim 
against the Met for two years. The constable has now been removed from 
frontline duties.

Yesterday
 a Met spokesman said: ‘Police Constable Carol Howard of the Diplomatic 
Protection Group is bringing an employment tribunal against the Met 
citing racial and sexual discrimination. The Met will robustly defend 
the claim.’

Her case, which also involves bullying allegations, will be heard at Central London Employment Tribunal on March 31.

The
 issue of racism is particularly sensitive for the force. This week 
Baroness Lawrence, the mother of murdered black teenager Stephen 
Lawrence, said she believes some attitudes ‘haven’t changed much’ since 
the Macpherson Report which claimed the Met was ‘institutionally 
racist’, 15 years ago.

Last
 year, on the eve of the 20th anniversary of his death, the Metropolitan
 Black Police Association declared the force is still ‘institutionally 
racist’.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'The Met will robustly defend the claim'

The racial 
discrimination claim is the latest in a series of allegations to rock 
the DPG after two of its officers were sacked on Wednesday for their 
role in the Plebgate scandal involving former chief whip Andrew 
Mitchell.

PC Keith Wallis, 
who was sentenced to 12 months in prison on February 6 for lying about 
witnessing the incident, was dismissed from the Met. PC James Glanville 
was also dismissed after a misconduct hearing found he had given 
information about the incident to The Sun newspaper and lied about it to
 investigators.

He was arrested on January 31 last year but in November was told he would not be charged.

Last
 year three officers in the unit were arrested over claims they 
exchanged ‘extreme’ pornography with each other on their mobile phones. 
They no longer face criminal charges but are still subject to an 
investigation into allegations of misconduct.
