They say 'like mother, like daughter', and now new research reveals an unexpected twist to the adage.

A poll of 2,000 Brits found that women who cheat are often following in their own mother's illicit footsteps.

According to the research, seven out of ten women who cheat on their husbands have mothers who were unfaithful too.

A new poll found 'the apple doesn't fall far from from the tree' when it comes to having affairs. Both men and women follow in their parents' footsteps

Many women feel their mother's infidelity gives them 'permission' to cheat - and they consequently take their marriage vows less seriously.

Men are also more likely to stray if their fathers were philanderers - but not to the same extent as women.

Just 54 per cent of unfaithful men said that cheating ran in the male half of the family.

Louise Van der Velde has an open relationship with fiance Mark Howard but says the men she has affairs with often have mums who were cheaters too

The results were revealed in a new poll of 2,000 people who have had affairs by Illicit Encounters, Britain's biggest extra-marital dating site.

The poll found that 73 per cent of women who cheated on their partners had mothers who had done the same.

And 62 per cent of those female cheats said their mother's infidelity had made it more likely that they would stray, too.

Adulteresses feared a backlash from their parents over an affair far less than the offspring of couples who had remained faithful.

Just 22 per cent of female cheats said their mother's disapproval would make them give up an affair - compared to 42 per cent for those whose mothers were faithful.

A further 32 per cent of female cheats felt their mother's infidelity had give them 'permission' to stray - because the behaviour runs in the family and would not be a surprise.

Men also mimic their father's cheating, but to a lesser extent.

Just over half of male cheats (54 per cent) said their father's affairs made it more likely that they would have them, too.

And 25 per cent of unfaithful men said they would give up affair if their cheating father told them to.

The typical female member of Illicit Encounters cheats on their partner THREE times in their first year on the site.

Male members cheat slightly less often - at 2.5 times on average.

An Illicit Encounters spokesman said: 'If you want to know if your wife will cheat, you may want to take a close look at your mother-in-law.

'Cheating does run in the family, particularly on the female side,'

Louise Van der Velde, 40, who is a widower and now engaged to be remarried says the men she's had affairs with often talk to their mums about their illicit relationships

He adds: 'Women idolise their mother as they grow up and follow their good and bad behaviour.

'If their parents divorce or their mother confides in them about previous affairs, women are far more likely to do the same when they marry themselves.'

Illicit Encounters member Louise Van der Velde, 40, has had five affairs with married men in her first year on the site.

She said the majority of the men she had slept with had parents who were cheats, too.

Louise, the widow of a GP, said: 'Cheating runs in the family.

Louise's vast experience of having affairs has led her to conclude that cheating runs in the family

'Sons or daughters of cheats fear the disapproval of their parents far less because they know they have been unfaithful too.

'One of the men I have been seeing is a wealthy banker from Surrey whose mother has been married three times.

'He grew up with her dating a succession of different men and that affected his behaviour as he got older.

'His mother is aware that he cheats on his wife and they have kept the secret between themselves.

'She told him, "Well, I can hardly start lecturing you after the way I've behaved."'

Louise said that many of her unfaithful female friends had mothers who were adulteresses.

She said: 'Some of them tell their mums all about their affairs. They have a good gossip about it.

'In some cases, their mothers are still having affairs anyway – so they are sharing tips on how to keep them secret.'

Louise sees men on Illicit Encounters despite being engaged to fiance Mark Howard, 39, a fitness instructor.

She said: 'I am completely honest and open with Mark and he understands that I don't think it is normal for a woman to say faithful to the same man for 30 or 40 years.

Life really is too short for that.'

Mark, who lives with Louise in Camberley, Surrey, said: 'I am fully aware of Louise's lifestyle and don't see anything wrong with it.

'We are completely honest with each other. It is great that there are sites like Illicit Encounters which can accommodate her needs.'

Illicit Encounters has seen a 40% increase in registrations in the last two years – largely due to booming house prices.

Couples simply cannot afford to divorce and fund two new homes, so they are staying together unhappily and spicing up their marriages with discreet affairs.
