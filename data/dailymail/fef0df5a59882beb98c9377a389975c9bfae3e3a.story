An aspiring hedge fund manager who confessed earlier this year to killing a 15-year-old boy in 1990 has been sentenced to 30 years in prison today.

Steven Goff, who was sentenced to aggravated manslaughter, told the victim's family in court: 'I wanted to give you your justice. You deserve to see me suffer.'

The 41-year-old had confessed to police in April, after saying he was haunted by a vision of the mother of his victim, Frederick Hart, 23 years after stabbing him.

Plea: Steven Goff, of Ventnor, pleaded guilty when he made his first court appearance in June

Under a plea agreement, Goff was sentenced to 30 years in prison and can apply for parole in 15 years, according to The Press of Atlantic City.

'[Goff] was free longer than my uncle was alive and breathing on this earth,' Frederick's niece, Jessica Culp, told the judge.

She was nine when her uncle was stabbed to death behind his house. His decomposed body was found by a hunter 19 months later.

Although some members of the victim's family have said they will forgive Goff, others have questioned why he did not come forward at the time.

According
to The Press of Atlantic City, they said they knew Goff was the killer,
but an alleged jailhouse confession while he was in prison for 
burglary, could not be used.

Goff
was ordered to look at Frederick's family, as they sat crying in court,
as he was told: 'We're burying Freddie all over again.'

After saying he knew 'sorry' was not enough, Goff explained that he had considered turning himself in three years ago.

'I know it's reopening old wounds,' he told the court. 'You deserve to see me suffer.'

The self-proclaimed maths genius and aspiring hedge fund manager told a
judge in June that he was an 18-year-old 'in a rage' when he stabbed 
Frederick and left him to die in 
Galloway Township.

Goff's attorney, James Leonard Jr.,said his client 
wanted to get the killing 'off his chest' and bring closure to the 
victim's family.

Punished: Steven Goff told his victim's family 'You deserve to see me suffer' as he was sentenced

The New Jersey man turned himself in 
in April because he was haunted by nightmares in which the victim’s 
mother appeared before him, according to the suspect's best friend.

Alan Rickel has told how Goff confided earlier that he was tortured by what he had done decades ago.

‘He
couldn't bear it anymore,’ Mr Rickel said. ‘He told me he had 
nightmares. He'd go to sleep and see the kid's mother staring in his 
face.’

‘He said, “Al, you're not going to see me anymore. I'm going to do something that will shock the world,”’ he added.

Mr Rickel said he knew Goff had psychological problems, and figured he was going through one of his periodic dark spells.

Earlier
this year, Goff called Rickel from northern Michigan. He said he had 
decided to return to New Jersey and take responsibility for having done 
something horrible.

‘He 
said he was going to meet his maker and “fess up to what he had done",' 
Mr Rickel said. ‘I said, “I don't know what you're talking about, but 
just come back and I'll get you some medicine and some help".'

Unsolved murder: Police say Goff was 18 years old when he murdered Hart and left his body to decompose for more than a year in Galloway Township, New Jersey

‘I thought he might be having a psychotic breakdown. He said, “No, it's much worse than that".'

Mr
Rickel said he wired his friend $500 to help him get back home. The 
next call he got was from Galloway Township police on April 1, saying 
Goff had confessed to a cold-case murder.

Police
and investigators from the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office said 
Goff had told him details about the case that only the real killer would
have known, Mr Rickel said.

Goff stabbed Hart multiple times with a knife in a wooded area behind the Clubs Condominiums May 7, 1990, according to police.

The teen was reported missing the following day, but it was not until more than a year later that a hunter came across his remains, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

The cause of death had never been determined because officials said the teenager's body had  decomposed.

Goff was nearly 18 at the time of the killing. He was a senior at Absegami High School, where Frederick was a freshman.

Illusions of grandeur: Goff, an aspiring hedge fund manager, described himself as a self-taught genius

At an earlier court appearance scheduled to present the murder and weapons charges to him, Goff surprised the judge by confessing and saying he was ready to enter a guilty plea, sobbing lightly as he said, 'I did the crime and I'm prepared to do the time.'

Superior Court Judge Michael Donio advised Goff that he had to wait until being indicted by a grand jury before he could enter a plea.

Mr Rickel met Goff 10 years ago and the 
two became friends. He said Goff was a skilled mechanic, plumber and 
electrician. But every once in a while, he would have what his friend 
described as ‘a rough spell.’

‘I always thought it was that he was a
moody guy, but now it's obvious that it was because of this,’ he said. 
‘He had some demons in him.’

For the past several years, Goff has been very active online, blogging and tweeting about the stock market, economics and politics.

Dark past: Goff revealed in an online bio that he was sentenced to five years in prison when he was 18

Goff apparently has been dabbling in stock trading but hoped to become a hedge fund manager.

But according to his online biography, Goff had a dark criminal past that included a five-year prison sentence on drug charges which he received when he was 18 – around the time of the killing.

Speaking about his past bad decisions, the 41-year-old wrote that he was a ‘master safe cracker thief, liar, professional slot machine cheat,’ a bad father, bad brother and bad son who had been stabbed and shot at.

On another blog site, Goff lamented that his being a convicted felon has kept him from realizing his ‘BIG IDEAS for this world and our species on this planet.’ 

‘I am now hindered from ever sitting for a LAW BAR exam or a series 7 brokers [sic] exam. Or from ever becoming a teacher,’ he wrote.

‘I am MOST p***** that I can never be called upon to defend my nation in service if need be. They will never let me ever touch a firearm ever again.’

Since his arrest friends have posted messages of support on Goff’s Facebook page and arranged for his beloved dog Biscuit to be adopted.
