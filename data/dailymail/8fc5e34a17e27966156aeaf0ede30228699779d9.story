A man was shot by Baltimore police officers in front of a huge mural remembering slain teenager Trayvon Martin.

The incident took place in the 1000 block of North Fremont Avenue during a traffic stop according to The Baltimore Sun.

Baltimore Police Department said an officer stopped the suspect's vehicle, then tased him before shooting him.

Investigation: Baltimore police have begun to investigate an incident after an officer shot and tased a man Sunday afternoon on the city's west side

Police: The incident took place in the 1000 block of North Fremont Avenue in Baltimore around 12:30 p.m.

Colonel Garnell Green did not say what circumstances led to the confrontation that occurred around 12:30 p.m.

'One of our officers initiated a car stop. During that car stop, the suspect got out of his vehicle,' Green said. 

'What happens after that is still under investigation. What I can tell you right now is this: One of our officers did tase the suspect and another officer shot the suspect.' 

He said: 'This investigation is early on. We're still canvassing for witnesses, checking cameras, and we're asking anyone who has witnessed it to come forward.' 

Police did not say if the suspect, who is now in critical condition, was armed or how many times the suspect was shot or why officers attempted to pull the vehicle over.

The police department did announce on Twitter that there had been an 'officer-involved shooting on the city's west side.'  

Few other details about the shooting are currently available, but police said the suspect was taken to an area hospital.

A crowd of onlookers gathered near where the shooting took place between the city's Upton and Sandtown-Winchester neighborhoods.
