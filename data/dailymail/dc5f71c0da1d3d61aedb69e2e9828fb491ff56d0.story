Anyone who has a fear of elevators may want to avoid the world’s tallest building when it's completed in four years’ time.

The Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia will feature the world’s fastest double-decker elevator, capable of ascending and descending the mighty skyscraper at 32ft (10 metres) a second.

This lift will let visitors travel more than 2,165ft (660 metres) in one go, so they can quickly climb the building that will measure an unprecedented 3,281ft (1km) tall.

The Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,
  (illustrated left) will feature the world’s fastest double-decker elevator that will ascend 
the mighty skyscraper at 32ft (10 metres) a second when it is built. It will use UltraRope technology (pictured right) which is significantly lighter than conventional steel cable

The shape of the tower is designed to reduce 'wind load' which increases with height. Its tapering wings are an aerodynamic shape to reduce structural loading due to wind.

It is a similar shape to the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai, which also has quite a stiff shape.

The differing shapes at different levels mean wind loads will go around the building.

One of the challenges is to build the tower so that it is not too rigid, but not too flexible so that it is unstable or people feel nauseous.

Another challenge for super tall buildings is the use of lifts and fire escapes, which in effect mean expensive unusable space.

The challenge of pumping concrete so high up a single, pressurised pipe is a huge engineering undertaking.

Santeri Suoranta, director of high-rise technology, at Kone, - the company that makes the lifts -  told MailOnline that users shouldn't feel feel queasy on their speedy journey to the top of the tower.

The most significant effect of shooting upwards or downwards at such a speed is that your ears can 'pop' as inner and outer ear pressure levels need time to adjust. It is likely that some users will feel their ears readjust.

'When travelling at speed in an elevator, the main factors to consider are vertical and lateral vibrations, noise and pressure change,' a spokesman for Kone said.

'In our latest lifts, we try and make sure that all of these elements are as balanced as possible to create a pleasurable elevator travel experience.

'Based on user research we know that 10 m/s is still at a comfortable level to travel,' so users should not feel ill.

A number of the elevators will be installed in the building.

They will use ‘high-tech carbon fibre cables and ‘UltraRope’ technology, which will one day enable elevators to travel up to 3,281ft (1,000m) in one go.

It is claimed the lightweight cable has the potential to transform skylines around the world, and by building upwards, will create living space for the world’s burgeoning and increasingly urban population.

The technology has been designed to match the strength of steel cables, while being much lighter.

It is made of up to four bands of carbon fibre encased in a custom Epoxy coating that increases friction and reduces slippage.

The elevator (illustrated in a GIF) will use high-tech carbon fibre cables. This so-called UltraRope technology means that lifts will one day be able to travel up to 3,281ft (1,000m) in one go

As buildings get taller, more steel cable has to be used to haul up the lifts – and lower them again safely.

By uing conventional cable, architects are therefore limited at how high they can build.

In a 1,640 feet (500m) lift shaft, for example, up to three-quarters of the energy needed to move an elevator is expended on the weight on the cables themselves.

This distance is considered the maximum that conventional cables can handle without snapping.

Weight and steel’s limited ability to bend means the energy required to operate an elevator rises exponentially with height.

The Finnish company claims that its rope reduces the weight of the cabling by 90 per cent and consequently cuts energy requirements too.

Problem solving: Engineers have to solve 
multiple problems to build the tower, from reducing the structure's 
weight and making it sway the right amount, to piping concrete almost 
more than half a mile (1 km) into the sky. Artists' impressions of the towering 
structure are pictured left and right

Centre piece: The skyscraper is intended to be the centre piece of the Kingdom City development beside the Red Sea and will have 200 floors, 160 of which would be habitable. This is an image of what it might be like to look down from the structure

The new cable was tested in the company’s lab, located in a 1.90 feet (333m) mine, and is designed to be resistant to wear and abrasion, reducing repair costs and the time spend out of service.

It is one of the first details confirmed about the skyscraper.

The construction of the world’s tallest tower is underway and when it is completed in 2018, it will have the world’s fastest double-decker lifts as well as the highest elevator rise.

The Kingdom Tower will house offices, a hotel, apartments and a vertigo-inducing observation spot.

In total, it will have 65 lifts and escalators, including seven double-decker lifts built by Kone.

The tower is the centre piece, and is the first construction phase of the Kingdom City development, located along the Red Sea on the north side of Jeddah.

The cable has been designed to match the strength of steel cables while being much lighter. It is made of up to four bands of carbon fibre encased in a custom Epoxy coating that increases friction and reduces slippage. It is shown in-situ on a pulley system

The proposed tower is estimated to cost $1.23bn and would be 568ft (173metres) taller than Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower, which is currently the world's tallest building (pictured)
