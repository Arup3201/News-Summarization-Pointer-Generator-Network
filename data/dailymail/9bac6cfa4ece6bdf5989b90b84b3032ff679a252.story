A teenager has celebrated her miraculous survival one year after she plunged 3,500 feet when her parachute became tangled during a skydive.

Doctors said they had no idea how Makenzie Wethington, from Joshua, Texas, survived the fall in Chickasha, Oklahoma in January 2014. She was left with broken bones and a brain injury.

'A year ago, we wouldn't think I was gonna live, and now I'm here a year later,' she told NBCDFW.

To mark the anniversary on Sunday, the 17-year-old, who is now walking again, returned to Oklahoma to meet and thank the emergency responders who helped save her life.

Reunited: Texas teenager Makenzie Wethington returned to Chickasha, Oklahoma on Sunday to meet the medical staff who treated her after she hit the ground during the botched skydive a year ago

Excited: 'These men are all my heroes to say at the least,' she wrote as she shared images of the reunion

'I just really wanted to see who helped save my life,' she said. 'Meeting them was just the best day of my life.'

On Facebook, she shared images of her grinning alongside the four men and the ambulance that held her until an air ambulance arrived to fly her to hospital. 

'These men are all my heroes to say at the least,' she wrote alongside the pictures.

'I thank God every day for saving my life and for giving the people who assisted in my journey the strength to help get me where I am today. Thank you to all who supported me and giving me the motivation to fight. A year ago I was Makenzie Strong, but today I am "Makenzie-Stronger".'

Last year, she had traveled to Chickasha with her father to skydive for her 16th birthday. In Texas, the legal age to sk-dive is 18 but Oklahoma allows 16-year-olds to jump with parental permission.

Her father, Joe Wethington, said in an interview after the incident that he thought she would jump from a plane with a guide but instead, she was told to jump alone. 

'She wasn't prepared,' Joe Wethington said. 'We weren't walked through the steps for the malfunction that did take place, at all.' 

Excitement: Makenzie, then 16, can be seen grinning before her ill-fated jump in January 2014

Day out: Her father, Joe Wethington, had agreed to take her to Oklahoma, where 16-year-olds can skydive

Bob Swainson, the owner of skydiving company Pegasus, said Makenzie and her father had about six hours of training before they jumped and were taught how to respond in emergency situations.

During the fall, her parachute ropes became tangled and Makenzie can only remember screaming before blacking out.

She suffered a major fracture in her liver, broke her pelvis, shoulder blade, several ribs, a lumbar vertebra in her lower spine and a tooth. She also suffered a traumatic brain injury.

'I wasn't there, but if she truly fell 3,500ft I have no idea how she survived,' Jeffrey Bender, the OU Medical Center trauma surgeon who treated Makenzie, said in a news conference days later.

'When I saw her in the emergency department, I would have predicted she was not going to survive all of this. But I'm always happy to be wrong about these things.' 

She spent nearly a week in the Intensive Care Unit at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center and as she improved, she was transferred to the Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation in Dallas. 

Injuries: She suffered a major fracture in her liver, broke her pelvis, shoulder blade, several ribs, a lumbar vertebra in her lower spine and a tooth. She also suffered a traumatic brain injury

Determined: Despite the pain from her broken bones, Makenzie (left at a press conference in February 2014 and right in rehab a week earlier) said she fought to walk because she  didn't want to be in a wheelchair

Speaking with NBC, she recalled how she was unable to put weight on her legs as she tried to walk, so instead had to use her upper body strength - despite broken shoulder and collar bones.

'But I was determined because I did not want to be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life,' she said.

She went home in mid-February 2014 and is now walking on her own. She said the pain is improving although she suffers headaches and migraines.

Makenzie, who has returned to school, now hopes to become a trauma surgeon to help others like she was helped.

And as for skydiving, she said the next time she even considers it will be after she's lived a long life. 

'Like when I'm 95, maybe,' she said, laughing.
