This is the moment a group of lemurs scrambled down a tree and burst into a fantastic dance display which wouldn't have looked out of place in Saturday Night Fever.

The primates had been eating berries from the top of the tall bark when they decided to cross a dirt road to a cluster of other trees.

As they landed on the ground each one burst into an array of impressive dance moves, including twirls, jumps, spins and stretches

Boogie nights: One lemur looked like he was pulling the same moves as John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever

They boogied their way across the track without stopping and even performed a few acrobatic stunts.

The elaborate routine only stopped when they reached another trunk and scrambled up to the top.

The whole dance routine was captured on camera by Allison Buttigieg, who was watching the lemurs' antics with her boyfriend, Olli Teirila.

The couple were enjoying a holiday on the island of Madagascar in the hope of photographing the dancing, made famous by the animated DreamWorks film.

Allison, 34, from Helsinki in Finland, said: 'Part of the reason I wanted to go to Madagascar is because they have lemurs there that look like they are dancing.

'We went to a spot where there were a group of them up in the trees and waited for many hours for them to move.

'Normally they jump from tree to tree but they had to cross a dirt road, so we were waiting for them to do that.

'Eventually they came down from the trees and started doing their little dance.

"They are adapted to the trees and they can't crawl so this is why they do it.

"I had seen them doing it on documentaries before and I had always said I wanted to go and see them for myself and take photos.

'It was very amusing and looked so funny, taking pictures was hard because I couldn't help but stop and just look at them as they did it.

As there was no competition from monkeys on Madagascar, lemurs soon came to dominate its rainforests

Allison waited for hours for the lemurs to come down for trees so she could catch them dancing

'I was ecstatic to get the photos as that was one of the main things I wanted to do, I was really happy.'

Lemurs are an old group of primates which evolved in near isolation after Madagascar split away from the African mainland.

They filled the ecological niches occupied by monkeys, the dominant primates, on mainland Africa.

As there was no competition from monkeys on Madagascar, lemurs soon came to dominate its rainforests, until boats started to arrive around 2,000 years ago and human hunters arrived.

Lemur size ranges from the world's smallest primate to - until fairly recently - some of its largest, the sloth lemurs, which rivalled gorillas in size.

Ancient: Lemurs are named after the lemures (ghosts or spirits) of Roman mythology

Lemurs use their hands and feet to move nimbly through the trees, but cannot grip with their tails
