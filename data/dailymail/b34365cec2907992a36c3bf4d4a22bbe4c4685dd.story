The luxury residence of Campbell's billionaire Jack Dorrance has gone on the market more than 20 years after his death.

The estate known as Linden Hill, which once housed the soup heir's vast collection of more than $120million worth of art and over $100,000 in wine, is being sold off by its current owner venture capitalist Robert Burch. 

The property with eight bedrooms and ten bathrooms stands in a 50 acre estate in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, has been restored to its heyday by Burch and it now resembles again the home John Dorrance Sr's son once acquired.

Mansion: The vast property is only the main building on the 50-acre grounds previously owned by the soup heir

Not condensed: The property has 7 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms

Restored: The current owners have restored the property to its heyday - the appearance that caught the attention of Campbell's soup heir John Dorrance Jr

Ornate: The agents say though in many ways antique the home remains a welcoming and liveable family home

The elder John Dorrance set in motion the world famous soup company at the turn of the century.

A
chemist by trade he was nephew of the general manager of the Joseph 
Campbell Preserve Company where he first worked and was grudgingly taken on.

The company were making soup but struggling with the logistics and cost of transporting it.

It was Dorrance Sr's scientific knowledge that led him to a way to take water out of the can and thereby substantially cutting the transportation costs.

Condensed soup turned the business around overnight.

Around
the same time a company executive attended a Cornell-Penn football game
and was moved by Cornell's red and white uniforms to suggest a 
redesign.

By 1922 
the company changed it's name to Campbell's Soup Company and the household brand was born. 

Assuming the company's 
presidency, Dorrance Sr acquired a vast and enviable wealth until his death in 1930.

John Jr, also known as Jack, worked through the ranks and took the helm in 1962, building upon his father's hard work.

A Princeton graduate he started out as a floor foreman and ended up being one of America's richest men.

$24million price tag: The Campbell soup family still have vast swathes 
of wealth after John Dorrance Sr , left, developed condensed soup. His son 
carried on the work and was able to buy this property, right

Room with a view: Dorrance's love of art can still be seen in the home despite the fact it was sold on after his death in 1989

No red and white: The property comes with 8 ornate fireplaces, stable and an aviary

He oversaw the company's development into frozen dinners and was in charge when Andy Warhol painted his first Campbell's soup can.

The artist said he was inspired to do so because he 'used to have the same lunch every day for 20 years'.

It
is unknown if this connection was the reason for Dorrance Jr's
love of art but when he died he passed on a vast collection of works.

According to Philly.com, the soup heir left a vast inheritance after his death in 1989.

$120 million worth of paintings, $2.8 million in Chinese 
porcelain and ceramics, $1.6 million in Chinese works of art, $362,620 
worth of silver, $2.8 million worth of Russian art and furniture and more 
than $1 million in 'decorations'.

He had 28 members of staff, many of 
whom were left $10,000 bonuses in his will executed after his sudden 
death from a heart attack.

His gardens alone contained $500,000 worth of sculpture and outdoor furniture.

And then there was the mansion itself 
or the 'entire village of complimentary buildings resembling a miniature Normandy' on the estate now all
for sale.

The agency Fine Homes say it is 'a welcoming, liveable family home' with 'intricately hand
carved English paneling, English Oak flooring, 8 ornate fireplaces,' 
and three staff rooms.

As well as the main house it comes with a caretakers property and guest cottage as well as a  House with a 10 car garage and aviary.
