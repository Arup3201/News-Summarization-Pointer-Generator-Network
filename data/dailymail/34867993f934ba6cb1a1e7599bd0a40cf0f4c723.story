Candy giant Hershey have agreed a settlement with a small Colorado marijuana edibles producer after accusing them of ripping off the design of the company's iconic chocolates and candies.

The firm filed a federal trademark infringement lawsuit against TinctureBelle in June alleging that their products Ganja Joy, Hasheath, Hashees and Dabby Patty too closely resembled Hershey's Almond Joy, Heath, Reese's peanut butter cups and York peppermint patty candies, respectively.

TinctureBelle has now agreed to recall and destroy all edibles it sold that looked like the famed chocolate company's products - or had names that played on their brands.

This means that products such as Hashees and Ganja Joy must be renamed before appearing on shelves again, abc NEWS reports.

The company also agreed not to make packages with brown, yellow and orange colors, which are those used by Hershey.

The world-renowned company claimed the edibles' packaging was dangerous as it could confuse consumers - especially children.

But TinctureBelle insisted in court filings that it stopped making edibles that mimic Hershey candy before the lawsuit was even filed. 

In June TinctureBelle President Char Maye told The Washington Post: 'The lawsuit from Hershey came as a huge surprise to us because we changed our entire label line approximately six months ago.

'Long before these allegations surfaced last week. Our new packaging looks nothing like Hershey’s or anyone else’s.'

In its initial complaint, Hershey offered side-by-side photos of its candy and TinctureBelle's products, showing names and package designs that appeared similar.

Mr Mayes added: 'The suggestion made by some media reports that our products are available to children, and even sold side-by-side with Hershey products, is dumbfounding, and shows a profound lack of awareness of how infused cannabis products are regulated, manufactured, and sold under Colorado’s strict regulatory regime.'

Mayes noted that TinctureBelle products are available only in state-licensed medical marijuana dispensaries and only to customers with a doctor-recommended, state-approved 'red card'. 

He also highlighted how its products were in non-transparent, child-proof packages and are not sold in the state's recreational pot stores. 

Founded in 1894, Hershey is North America's largest chocolate manufacturer.
