Oregon authorities say a suspect brought in for questioning later punched himself in the face and then filed an assault complaint against detectives.

But unfortunately for the suspect, a video recorder was running in a holding room where he'd been left after questioning in Eugene.

The sheriff's department said Tuesday the footage shows 33-year-old Aleksander Robin Tomaszewski hitting himself, inflicting two black eyes.

In total, the video shows Tomaszewski hitting himself 45 times.

Self-inflicted assault: Tomaszewski was subsequently charged with attempted coercion and initiating a false report and was found guilty last week

Investigators say he told them he hoped filing a complaint would get him released. 

Authorities say the Lucerne, California, man was brought in for questioning on January 9 on an unrelated case that's still under investigation.

According to The Register Guard, the charges included stalking and first-degree sexual abuse.

He was separately charged with initiating a false report and attempted coercion, and found guilty last week. 

He was sentenced to 20 days in jail, 36 months probation and fined $500 for attempted coercion.

For initiating a false report, he received a $100 fine and 20 additional days in jail.
