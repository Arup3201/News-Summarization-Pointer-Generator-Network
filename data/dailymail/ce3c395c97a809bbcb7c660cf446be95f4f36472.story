The share price of RBS fell after its chief executive Stephen Hester refused to take up his £1m bonus

British taxpayers have lost nearly £900million on the value of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking group shares after Stephen Hester gave up his bonus as RBS chief.

The share price of the two banks plummeted yesterday over fears that the backlash against bonuses would damage their performance.

RBS chief executive Hester gave up his bonus of £1million following intense political pressure.

The share price at Lloyds, whose chief executive has also turned down his bonus, dropped by 4.1 per cent, wiping £921million of its value.

At RBS, share prices fell by 3.5 per cent, decreasing its value by £580million.

As RBS is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer and Lloyds 41 per cent, the share price drops equate to a fall of close to £900million.

The news emerged as pressure inensified on other leading bankers to follow the example of RBS chief Hester and give up multi-million pound bonuses.

As hundreds more RBS employees wait to hear what they can expect from a bonus pot of around £500million this year, Business Secretary Vince Cable called for a ‘sense of perspective’ in an age of austerity for most.

RBS investment banking boss John Hourican remains in line for a salary and bonus of up to £5.9million.

RBS has been urged to show restraint over the bonuses of other executives due in the next few weeks

The bank, along with Lloyds, is under pressure to show restraint over other executive bonuses due to be handed out soon.

Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted yesterday that the row over Mr Hester’s bonus must not be a ‘one-off episode’ and called on the Government to reintroduce a specific tax on bankers’ bonuses and put a worker on the board of every firm to help set executive pay.

Coalition tensions over the issue are threatening to burst into the open, with Liberal Democrats complaining last night that the Treasury ‘stonewalled’ for months over the issue of Mr Hester’s bonus.
