Discovered: Theresa Mateo, 34, was found in an embrace with Scott Jacobi in a Staten Island Hilton on Friday after an apparent suicide pact

A couple who were found dead in each other's arms on the bed of a Hilton hotel room committed double suicide after 'a run of bad luck', a relative has claimed.

The bodies of Theresa Mateo, 34 and Scott Jacobi, 37, were discovered by staff at the Hilton Garden Inn in Staten Island just before 1pm on Friday after they failed to check out.

Investigators say their cause of death is yet to be determined, pending autopsy results, but sources told the New York Daily News that they believe the couple - who had been dating for about eight months - died in a suicide pact.

'They were having a run of bad luck,' a relative of Mr Jacobi's told the paper. Sources suggest they died from an overdose, even though no drugs or relevant paraphernalia were found in the room.

The relative did not go into any further detail about the couple's misfortune but relatives of Ms Mateo's claimed they had experienced relationship problems.

'Theresa always said to me, "I canâ€™t find the right guy,"' one neighbor, who wished not to be named, told the paper.

Meanwhile, Miss Mateo's distraught mother, who raised her daughter in the Bronx, was said to be blaming her daughter's death on an ex-boyfriend with whom she split a few months before she began dating Mr Jacobi, a Staten Island native.

Dressed all in black, Mrs Mateo was apparently inconsolable on Saturday, telling neighbours: 'My baby is gone.'

The New York Post earlier quoted an unnamed hotel employee as saying they were discovered fully clothed in their hotel room by a housekeeper.

Sources at the NYPD have said that they believe the couple died of a drug overdose.

The source added they were 'advised by the New York City Police Department that it was an overdose.'

The pair were discovered dead in each other's arms in this Staten Island Hilton where staff were at a loss to explain what had occurred

However, the city medical examiner's office will not officially confirm the cause of death until the autopsies are completed.

'There was no blood, nothing like that, no signs that weapons were used,' the employee said.

'It's really said. They were in their mid-thirties. That's young,' they added. 'Thank God we found them quick.'

The pair checked in Wednesday at 6 p.m..

Once the bodies were found, police blocked the room off using a portable partition.

Jacobi's neighbor described him as good-natured and hard-working.

'He
 was such a good guy,' said Terry Delre, who lived next door to Jacobi 
for six years. 'He was such a sweetheart...I called him my second son. 
Clean cut, hardworking, no wild parties, no nothing. I never once seen 
that boy drunk.

'I can't even picture this,' she added. 'He was such a stable-minded guy. I can't image what transpired.'

Adding
 to the mysterious circumstances: the couple left no note, no weapons 
were discovered, and the room contained no evidence of drugs or drug 
paraphernalia.
