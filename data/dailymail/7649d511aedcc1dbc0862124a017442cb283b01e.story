Vindication? Austerity champion George Osborne

The number of people in work hit a record high yesterday – giving another significant pre-election boost to the Tories.

Official figures show that there are 1.85million more people in employment now than when the Coalition came to power in May 2010.

The economy has bounced back to such an extent that last year an average of 1,600 people found work every day.

The Office for National Statistics also revealed that wage growth is outpacing inflation at the fastest rate in almost five years – leaving people with more money in their pockets.

The jobs and wages figures came amid a flurry of good economic news:

In an attempt to pour cold water on the positive statistics, Labour claimed too many of the jobs were low paid and pointed to a small rise in youth unemployment.

But speaking to workers at a Rolls-Royce plant in West Sussex, Mr Cameron said: ‘We inherited a situation where far too many people were unemployed, where we weren’t creating enough jobs in our country.

‘Since I became Prime Minister, we haven’t solved or tackled all of unemployment, but we have got 1.85million more people in work today than when I became Prime Minister.

‘I sit round that European Union council table with the 27 other countries – I was there last week. Britain, in the last four years, has created more jobs than the rest of Europe put together, so we are on our way.’

On a visit to Felixstowe, Suffolk, today, Mr Cameron will promise a ‘brighter future for hard-working people’ ahead of a speech to business leaders.

He will say: ‘Our long-term economic plan is working. I am determined to go further and we will keep working through our plan to secure a brighter future for hard-working people.’

Yesterday’s figures showed that three quarters of all Britons aged 16 to 64 are now in work after the employment rate reached 73.2 per cent.

This is the joint highest level since records began in 1971, the same figure having also been achieved in 2004 and 2005.

There are now 608,000 more people in employment than a year ago. That is 30.89million people in work compared with 29.04million in April 2010, the last month before the Government came to power.

The unemployment rate has also tumbled and is now 5.7 per cent, the lowest in seven years. The UK has the third lowest rate in the European Union, behind only Austria and Germany.

The number claiming jobseeker’s allowance fell by 38,600 in January to 823,000, the 27th consecutive monthly fall and the lowest since 2008.

Pay rises, excluding bonuses, rose by 1.7 per cent in the year to December, which is lower than last month’s growth of 1.8 per cent, but still more than three times higher than inflation that month of 0.5 per cent.

Inflation has since dropped again to 0.3 per cent – a 55-year low – further easing the squeeze on family finances as the cost of living falls. Including bonuses, workers saw a pay rise of 2.1 per cent in the past 12 months, the highest rate since 2011.

John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘Many of our members have told us that they intend to expand their businesses and hire staff this year, and so we would expect these positive trends in the headline jobs data to continue in the coming months.’

James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said wages would continue to rise as competition for talent intensified.

‘Two thirds of IoD members are planning pay rises at least in line with inflation over the coming months,’ he added. 

Labour was last night accused of ‘talking down the economy’ by highlighting a small rise in youth unemployment – despite the fact that the overall jobless total fell sharply.

The number of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work rose by 3,000 between October and December to 740,000. Labour said the figure was ‘extremely worrying’ – even though youth unemployment has actually fallen by 21 per cent or 198,000 under the Coalition, having risen by nearly 44 per cent under the last Labour government.

Tory MP Mark Garnier said: ‘Labour is talking down the economy ... [the party] is proving it is not good for Britain.’
