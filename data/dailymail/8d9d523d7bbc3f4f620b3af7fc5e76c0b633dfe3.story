Sam Allardyce has admitted that Winston Reid has 'no future' at West Ham and expects the defender to leave when his contract ends in the summer.

Reid has refused to sign a new deal with the east London club and it now appears his five-year stay will come to an end on June 30 when his contract expires.

The 26-year-old failed to impress in his initial years in England after moving from Danish side Midtjylland in 2010, but he has grown to become one of the most accomplished defenders in the Premier League.

But Allardyce conceded: 'There is no future for Winston Reid at West Ham at the moment. His contract finishes on June 30. He hasn't said he's going to sign or that he's not going to sign.

'I'm airing on the side that he isn't going to sign by the feel of it and look of it. Knowing how the football world works, talking to managers about the situation it's very unlikely Winston will sign for us given what people are saying to me.'

Reid, in action against West Brom, has made over 100 appearances for the Hammers since signing in 2010

Currently he is only free to talk to clubs outside of England about signing pre-contract terms.

Arsene Wenger has sent Arsenal scouts to watch him in every game since November and are planning a £4million move for him in January.

Liverpool and Manchester United are also thought to be interested and there could now be a clamour for his signature.
