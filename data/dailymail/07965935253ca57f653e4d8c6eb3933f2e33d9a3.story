A former San Antonio teacher accused of directing students to hit a schoolmate for being a bully has been sentenced to 30 days in jail.

Cynthia Ambrose also was ordered Tuesday to serve two years' probation. She was convicted in June of official oppression, a misdemeanor.

Prosecutors say the 44-year-old former kindergarten teacher at Salinas Elementary School told her students in May 2012 to line up and hit the 6-year-old boy so he knows 'how it feels to be bullied.'

The San Antonio Express-News reports state District Judge Sid Harle said he wants to prevent Ambrose from teaching for two years, the maximum probation term allowed.

Ambrose cried when she was handcuffed as Harle said, 'This is absolutely a parent's worst nightmare.'

'They send their children ... and entrust you with them.'

Addressing the court, Amborse said that she was in fact not a nasty person and 'I hope and pray that all parties involved find peace.'

The state prosecutor, Patrick Ballantyne had initially argued for a 90-day jail sentence but settled for 30, because the judge imposed probation on Ambrose.

'This was not really a case about bullying as was portrayed in the media,' Ballantyne said according to My San Antionio.

'This was really a case about child abuse.'

Ambrose's lawyer, Dayna Jones had tried to argue that very few of the students recalled the event and that 'it was a misunderstanding.'

However, during the trial the court heard how Neely was brought to Ambrose after he had been seen to hit a student.

Put in front of the classroom, Ambrose encouraged her students to hit Neely which only ended when the seventh student hit Neely so hard that he began to cry.

He is allowing her to serve the jail sentence on work release or to report to the Bexar County Jail on weekends.

The former teacher was convicted of official oppression in June and had previously faced up to a year in jail.

The May 2012 incident occurred when the boy was brought to Ambrose by his teacher, Barbara Ramirez, after he hit another student.

The boy, Aiden Neely, now seven, told the jury this week he remembers getting hit by students and later telling his brothers, but they didn't believe him.

'It started out as a pat,' Ramirez said. 'Then she told the class, 'Come on, hit him harder.'

Ramirez was granted immunity in exchange for her testimony. She said she reported the incident to the school principal two weeks later.

'I've never heard of anything like this in my 30 years,' Salinas Elementary School Principal Jeffrey Large said.

'I've heard of teachers using excessive force, but never putting students against other students.'

Prosecutor Patrick Ballantyne said in court in June that the incident was 'so far outside the bounds of classroom discipline to where it becomes criminal.'

Ambrose's lawyer, James Scott Sullivan, questioned Ramirez's statements during closing arguments, saying her testimony was dubious.
