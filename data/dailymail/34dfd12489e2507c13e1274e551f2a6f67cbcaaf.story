Craig Kieswetter has taken to Twitter to show off his battle scars after being struck in the face by a cricket ball.

Kieswetter suffered a broken nose and fractured right cheekbone whilst at the crease for Somerset during their LV= County Championship match at Northamptonshire on Saturday.

Accompanied with the light-hearted message: 'Apparently chicks dig scars...!? #rocky', the picture shows his right eye heavily swollen and cut.

Urgent help: Team doctor's from both sides quickly came to the aid of Kieswetter who had to retire hurt

The 26-year-old was struck off the bowling of David Willey whilst at the crease for Somerset.

Pitched as a bouncer, Willey's delivery lodged inside Kieswetter's helmet as he mistimed a pull shot.

The England One Day and Twenty20 international's injury was so severe that he was forced to retire hurt from his innings as blood gushed from his face.

Team doctor's from both counties quickly attended the incident as Kieswetter left the field heavily compressing his damaged right eye.

The South African-born wicketkeeper had scored 14 runs off 16 minutes in the Division One encounter at the County Ground before the painful blow.

After winning the toss on Saturday, Somerset elected to bat as they try to close the gap on Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire at the top of the table.
