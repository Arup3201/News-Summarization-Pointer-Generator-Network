A new Channel 4 show has lifted the lid on the love and sex lives of the over-60s and, contrary to popular belief, whether 
single, straight or gay, many are enjoying a second bloom and sexual 
relationships well into their pensionable years.

Channel 4 News 
carried out in-depth interviews with 76 over-60s all over the country 
and polled another 500 to find out about love, sex and relationships.

'It's the secret sex life of your parents and grandparents,' one 70-year-old woman in Somerset told the show.

New show: Channel 4 News will be airing a new show called Secret Sex Life of Parents and Grandparents, which will reveal all about love, relationships and sex in over 60s

In fact, 51 per cent of people over 60 said they're sexually active and many describe enjoying a late sexual bloom.

'I can say that sometimes in the street I think "oh yeah, that would be a nice person to go to bed with,"' Vikki, 70, from Dorset told the programme, which is called Love and Sex for the over 60s and airs tonight at 7pm.

Joey, 69, from London, added: 'I got to a point where I thought I'm going to kick the bucket fairly soon', so three months ago he joined Grindr, the mobile dating app for gay men revealed: 'I'm averaging, I would say, four men a week.'

Despite many feeling liberated in themselves, many said they didn't feel like society was very approving of OAP sex. 

Virtual love: Stella and Peter, 71, met online and got married a year ago having both lost their long-term partners

Separate lives: Channel 4 News carried out in-depth interviews with 76 over 60s all over the country, including Carol and David, who live apart to keep things fresh

Back on the market: Joey, 69, from London said: 'I got to a point where I thought I'm going to kick the bucket fairly soon', so three months ago, he joined Grindr, the mobile dating app for gay men and is now averaging four dates a week

Many felt overlooked and that they became invisible after the menopause. Margaret, 67, from Oxfordshire said: 'We still feel as though we have a right to be a sexual being as well as everything else. We're not just grannies. I'm not anyway! Younger people nowadays must think "oh god, that's gross, you know, granny's at it."'

Connie, 83, from London, has just signed up for a dating site, even though she can't work a computer. Her granddaughter Nicola is acting as both facilitator and gatekeeper and sifting those she thinks are suitable.

As Nicola sends a smiley to a man called John who's caught her Grandma's eye, Connie says that Nicola need not worry about her because she's 'got my wits about me, I do know what it's all about'.

New research: Their research discovered that 51 per cent of people over 60 said they're sexually active and many describe enjoying a late sexual bloom, just like David

Stella and Peter met online and got married a year ago having both lost their long-term partners.

Peter, who was 70 at the time, recounts the nerves of starting over again after many years without sex and said 'I can remember sitting on the sofa with Stella and discussing this and saying well I really don't know whether anything works anymore. So we decided to find out basically'.

The internet has made finding love so much easier but this increased access to sex is leading to increased rates of sexually transmitted infections. In fact, STIs have doubled in the 50-90 age group in the past ten years.

Discovery: For some women, it has only been in later years that they experienced an orgasm for the first time. Solange, 79, from Wales said: 'I might have been in my 40s when I had an inkling of what it was. By my 60s I'd finally figured out what it was. And in my 70s "yes that's what it is"

Who knew? Many OAPs that Channel 4 spoke to said their sex lives just get better and better with age - and whether single, straight or gay, many are enjoying a second bloom

Justin Gaffney, a sexual health nurse consultant, said: 'There is a degree of naivety in the older population in that they just don't see that they are at risk of sexual infections'.

In fact older people become more susceptible to STIs as they age - yet 64 per cent of respondents who are either in new relationships or are dating hadn't sought sexual health advice.

Justin has had people come to him using household products as lubricants - shampoo, hand cream and even cooking oil. 'There does need to be perhaps a focus on trying to make services more older people-friendly,' he said.

In many ways it is no surprise that older people are taking risks. Many respondents revealed that their first marriages in the 1950s and 60s had been repressed and if they are dating again today that they are keen to experiment and enjoy a much more empowered, adventurous relationship.

For some women, it has only been in later years that they experienced an orgasm for the first time.

Solange, 79, from Wales, said: 'I might have been in my 40s when I had an inkling of what it was. By my 60s I'd finally figured out what it was. And in my 70s "yes that's what it is"'.

Findings: Despite many feeling very liberated in themselves, many said they didn't feel like society was very approving of OAP sex

51 per cent of people over 60 said they are sexually active

46 per cent of respondents said sex is important to their lives

33 per cent of respondents who are single said that they would like to meet someone new
