A British tourist is in critical condition after plunging from his hotel's balcony on the Spanish holiday island of Mallorca.

The unidentified 21-year-old fell from the fourth-floor of the Hotel Honolulu, in the popular resort of Magaluf at 3.25am this morning.

Police sources said he suffered multiple serious injuries and was rushed to Son Espases Hospital.

Police in the resort, which is renowned for its nightlife, have launched an investigation into the incident.

Doctors are continuing to treat him in the intensive care unit.

The incident came on the same day that Spain's National Police launched a campaign - via social networks Facebook and Twitter - warning foreign tourists about the dangers of drinking excessively and being on hotel balconies.

Two weeks ago British father-of-three Craig Knapp, 31, died after falling from a balcony while on a family holiday in Magluf.

Friends played tribute to Mr Knapp, from Dundee, who was father to Craig Jnr, 12, Rhys, six, and Dara, four.

And last month Sean Kelly, 24, was seriously injured after plunging 70ft from a hotel balcony in Magaluf.

He was reportedly climbing from one balcony to another on the seventh floor of the building when he fell to the ground.

Last summer five British tourists fell from balconies in the space of just six weeks, and three of them died.
