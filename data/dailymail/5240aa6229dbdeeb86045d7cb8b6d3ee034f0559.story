Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon has joined Everton on loan for the remainder of the season.

Everton will pay £1million up front but the clubs have not agreed a fee to make the deal permanent.

The Merseyside club confirmed the signing on their Twitter feed around 10.30pm on Monday, half an hour before the 11pm deadline. 

Speaking to evertonfc.com, Lennon said: 'I’m really looking forward to seizing this opportunity at a club with such a history and with such great potential, too.

'The manager wants to play exciting, attacking football and I’m determined to make a big contribution over the remaining games.'

Lennon will join up with Roberto Martinez's side until the end of the current season 

Everton manager Roberto Martinez is delighted to have clinched the signing of Lennon, saying: 'We all know what Aaron will bring to our squad with his experience and know-how, his involvement with England in two World Cups and the landmarks he has set in the Premier League.

'At 27, Aaron will be a really important asset to our squad and he will represent a real boost in terms of attacking options from now to the end of the season. His pace and trickery will fit in well at Goodison.'

Lennon is eligible to make his debut against Liverpool on Saturday.

Jermaine Jenas, who played with Lennon at Spurs, revealed on BBC Radio 5 Live that he had received a text from him saying he had agreed personal terms with Everton. 

Lennon had appeared to be heading to join another former Spurs team-mate - Jake Livermore - at Hull City, but the Tigers' woeful form led to a cooling in the winger's interest.

Stoke City were also keen to sign Lennon, who has been capped 21 times by England, but Martinez appears to have won the race for his signature.

The signing will be Everton's first of the transfer window. The Merseyside club have, however, sold Samuel Eto'o and Hallam Hope, and loaned out youngsters Chris Long and Mason Springthorpe. 

The 27-year-old winger was also linked with moves to Premier League duo Hull City and Stoke City
