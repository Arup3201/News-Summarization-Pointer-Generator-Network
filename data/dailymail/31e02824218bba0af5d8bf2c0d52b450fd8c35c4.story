A massive snowstorm, the season's fifth, is set to dump over a foot of snow on the Northeast this weekend.

Boston, New York, Philadelphia and their suburbs are bracing themselves for the season’s biggest snowstorm as it steams up the Atlantic coast just in time to snarl weekend plans.

A nasty mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow will plague coastal sections while inland areas can expect to see more than a foot of snow.

The nasty weather is the child of two separate storms – an arctic cold front moving over the Great lakes, and a strong low pressure system spinning along the coastline – that are expected to collide and wreak havoc over the Northeast, forecasters said.

Known as a nor'easter, the coastal storms often cause coastal flooding and have been known to send storm surges into coastal towns.

‘This next system is really going to be a very significant storm for a lot of the country,’ Weather Channel meteorologist Carl Parker told NBC News.

‘It’s going to grab up plenty of moisture off the Atlantic, throw it back and into the Northeast,’ he added.

Tens of millions of people can expect travel to come to a halt as wintry weather grounds planes, snarls traffic and makes roads dangerous.

Two-day event: The storm will last into Sunday for Boston and New England, but should be mostly over by Sunday morning for New York and Philadelphia

The storm is expected to start impacting New York and Philadelphia from Saturday morning until early Sunday, and should affect New England for most of Sunday.

Big cities New York and Philadelphia should expect to see about five inches of snow, Boston could see as much as 8 inches, according to forecasters.

Accumulations in New York and Philadelphia will be held down by the eventual change to rain Saturday night, said forecasters.

The storm will be at its height in Philadelphia during the annual Army-Navy football game, leading to a repeat of last weekend’s snowy Eagles game.

Areas to the north and west, especially northern New Jersey, the lower Hudson Valley and interior New England are expected to see about a foot of snow, but central New England  could see 18 inches or more, according to Accuweather.

An icy mixture will hit southern and coastal areas, especially in central and southern New Jersey.The storm should be completely out of the region by Sunday night.
