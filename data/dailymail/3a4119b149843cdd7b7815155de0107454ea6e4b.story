Lego has been voted the world's most powerful brand toppling car manufacturer Ferrari from the top spot and seeing off challenges from other heavyweight companies such as Rolex.

The success of last year's Lego Movie, which was praised by critics and made almost half a billion dollars worldwide, helped to ease it into the number one spot.

The stop-motion style of the film also helped spawn countless online Lego parodies of famous events, making the toy 'an artistic medium in its own right', according to analysts Brand Finance.

Danish toy Lego has been voted the world's most powerful brand thanks in large part to the success of last year's Lego Movie, which was well received critically and made nearly half a billion dollars at the box office

Lego took the number one spot for its appeal to both genders, its ability to cross cultural boundaries, and its ability to inspire adults as well as children (pictured, Lego art on display in Brussels)

The toy saw off competition from super-brands such as Red Bull, Coca Cola, Nike and Unilever - which owns companies such as Flora, PG Tips, Persil and Comfort. 

Brand Finance impressed with Lego's ability to appeal to both genders, cross cultural borders, and to inspire adults as well as children.

For the survey, each company was given a rating based on the health of their finances, how recognisable they were, and how customers felt about them.

This data was then used to give each company a letter rating from AAA+ to D, with only 12 companies awarded the top accolade.

Consumer brands such as L'Oreal, Burberry, and Walt Disney made up ten of the top 12.

However business management firm PricewaterhouseCoopers took second, while consultancy company McKinsey came in fifth.

Brand Finance CEO David Haigh said: 'Lego's appeal spans generations; as well as the creative freedom it gives children, the brand appeals to the nostalgia of adults.

'It generally avoids gendered marketing - by appealing to boys and girls equally Lego maximises the size of its target demographic.

'That approach also pleases parents, as concerns mount over the effect toys may have on the outlook and ambitions of children, and girls in particular.

'However this year's particularly strong performance is thanks to the Lego Movie.

'The film was both a critical and commercial success providing not just immediate revenue but also an unrivalled marketing tool.

Ferrari slipped from the top spot into eight place after another Formula 1 season without a win, and following the departure of chairman Luca Di Montezemolo (pictured)

'Amateur versions of the film's stop-motion technique have proliferated online to the extent that Lego could be described as an artistic medium in its own right.'

He added that Ferrari had dropped from first place to eight after another Formula 1 season without a win, and due to the departure of chairman Luca di Montezemolo. 

The annual Brand Finance report also looked at the world's most valuable brands which is headed by Apple, as it was last year, along with Samsung, Google and Microsoft.
