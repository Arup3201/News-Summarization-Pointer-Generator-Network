The court battle between two girls and
their Pennsylvania school over 'I â™¥ Boobies' bracelets could be settled
by the US Supreme Court.

The
Easton Area School District board voted 7-1 Tuesday night to appeal a 
federal appeals court's decision that rejected its claim the bracelets 
are lewd and should be banned from school.

The
case started in 2010 when two girls, then ages 12 and 13, challenged 
the school's ban on the bracelets designed to promote breast cancer 
awareness among young people.

Students Brianna Hawk and Kayla Martinez said they merely hoped to promote awareness of the disease at their middle school. Instead their school is fighting their right to wear them

The students, Brianna Hawk and Kayla 
Martinez, said they merely hoped to promote awareness of the disease at 
their middle school. They filed suit when they were suspended for 
defying the ban on their school's Breast Cancer Awareness Day.

In
August, the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's 
decision in favor of the girls, saying also that the district didn't 
prove the bracelets are disruptive.

Superintendent John Reinhart told The Express-Times of Easton he supports the board's decision.

'The
Third Circuit Court has compromised administrators' abilities to 
intervene in what is and what is not appropriate in school,' he said.

In court sessions, Reinhart had called the bracelets 'cause-based marketing energized by sexual double-entendres.'

An
attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped the girls
challenge the rule, said Tuesday night the school had been hinting that
it would petition the Supreme Court.

'I'm
just really surprised that they're so determined to fight this speech 
case of all speech cases,' said Mary Catherine Roper. '(The bracelets) 
didn't cause any problems in the school.'

School
district solicitor John Freund said the district had the backing of the
National School Boards Association and the Pennsylvania School Board 
Association. He said they and other organisations are 'concerned about 
the implications of a hyper-sexualised environment,' The Express-Times 
reported.

The lone board member to vote against the appeal said the district should just drop the matter.

'I think we should be done with it. Let it go. We lost 20, 30 times, I don't even know anymore,' Frank Pintabone said.

Easton
is one of several school districts around the country to ban the 
bracelets, which are distributed by the nonprofit Keep A Breast 
Foundation of Carlsbad, California.
