Fourteen hardy Krasnodar supporters laid claim to being Europe's most loyal fans by travelling two thousand miles from southern Russia for a Europa League tie at monsoon-like Goodison Park with their team already eliminated from the competition.

The Russians, who had to catch two planes and a train to get to Merseyside, made light of the ceaseless heavy rain to cheer on their side to the regular singing of Hey Jude - a tribute for being at the home of The Beatles.

And generous Everton allowed them free entry into their Alex Young lounge to have drinks before and at half time with other members of Krasnodar'a official delegation and families of their players.

Everton had already been confirmed as winners of Group H before Thursday's game while Krasnodar, a city of 750,000 people an hour from the Black Sea, were out after collecting only three points from their opening five games.

But supporter Yevgeny Shevchenko, 40, said they could never have contemplated missing the game.

'We go everywhere to follow our team, he said.

Having already qualified for the last 32 of the Europa League, Everton rested several key players on Thursday

'I flew to Vienna, then London, then caught the train to Liverpool. Others flew to Moscow first.

'We have planned the trip carefully and practised Hey Jude before we got here.'

Everton said they were delighted to look after the small independent group of travelling fans.

'It takes a lot of time and money to make these kind of trips, we were only too happy to welcome the Krasnodar fans and allow them to have a drink in one of our lounges,' said Everton's director of communications Richard Kenyon.
