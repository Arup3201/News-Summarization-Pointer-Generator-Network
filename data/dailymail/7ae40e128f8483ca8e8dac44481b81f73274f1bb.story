A fan of Take That for more than 22 years, Mandy Emerson, 44, from Gateshead, couldn't believe her luck when she finally got the chance to meet Gary Barlow.

But when she saw the photos of the moment, Ms Emerson, who, at just 5ft 1", tipped the scales at 19st 10lbs, was left humiliated by the sight of her less than slender frame.

Spurred on to lose weight by the picture, she now weighs 11st 10lbs and says she hopes to meet the singer again to show off her newly svelte figure.

Looking good: Mandy Emerson has shed almost half her body weight following a meeting with Gary Barlow

'I couldn't believe it when I was chosen to meet Gary," said Ms Emerson. 'As I stood up all I could think about was my dream was coming true - and I looked a complete mess and I was going to look horrific on the photograph.

Barlow, who has also struggled with his weight over the years, was filming The X-Factor in Manchester when Ms Emerson was introduced.

'I have wanted to meet Gary for 22 years, so to get picked to finally meet him was amazing,' she adds.

'But when I looked back at the picture I was upset by the way that I looked and it shocked me.'

Ms Emerson's problems began at the age of 21 following the birth of her son Lee, who is now 23, and were made worse after she had a hysterectomy aged 30.

Indulging in a diet of burgers, fry-ups, chips and pies, she began to pile on the pounds and eventually developed asthma as a result.

Compounding the problem were the steroids prescribed to treat an auto-immune condition and diabetes medicine given to her by her GP.

Following the embarrassing moment with Barlow, which took place at a recording of The X Factor in Manchester, Ms Emerson was humiliated further when a medical consultant suggested that she have a gastric band fitted.

'You have to be grossly overweight for that, so I [thought that] I must be,' remembers Ms Emerson, who describes the moment as 'devastating'.

Instead, she joined her local Slimming World group, the Birley Buffs, and after overhauling her diet and beginning a regular exercise regime, has managed to lose more than 8st.

Once a size 28, she is now a slim size 14 and has overcome many of her medical ailments, including her diabetes and sky-high cholesterol levels.

'I never dreamt I could achieve so much and it's made such a huge difference - it's changed my life,' she adds.

Overjoyed: A thrilled Ms Emerson would now like to meet Barlow for a second time - and get a better photo

'I've got so much more energy and I can do things now that I couldn't before. My fitness has improved - I enjoy being active now rather than thinking of it as a chore.

'I know a lot of people like me worry about joining a slimming club because they don't know what to expect.

'But from the minute I walked into Slimming World, the support I've received from my consultant Nicola Young and the rest of the group has been brilliant.

'I couldn't have done it without them. It's like having lots of cheerleaders on your side, when you're doing well they spur you on further and when you're struggling they keep you going.'

Although Ms Emerson was thrilled to be nominated for the Slimming World Woman of the Year competition by her friends, there is still one person she wants to show off her newly slender frame to - Gary Barlow.

'I would love to meet Gary again to get a picture taken with him now that I'm slimmer,' she beams. 'It would mark the significant change that I've made.'
