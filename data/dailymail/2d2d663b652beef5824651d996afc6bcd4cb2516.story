Farmer's fury: David Gould has hit out at his neighbour Alan Jackson who shot dead his collie Poppy but was cleared by a court of trespassing on his land

A dairy farmer whose collie dog was shot dead by his neighbour 'Bang Bang Jack' has spoken of his fury after the gunman was cleared of wrongdoing.

David Gould, 49, was milking his cows when sheep farmer Alan Jackson came into his garden and fired at his dog Poppy with a shotgun.

Mr Gould ran to help his black and white dog but she died outside his farmhouse in Henbury, Cheshire, before he could summon help a court heard.

Police arrested Mr Jackson, 51, who claimed he had earlier seen Poppy attacking one of his ewes and decided to shoot the dog dead to protect his flock.

It was claimed pellets from Mr Jackson’s gun had also smashed a window and become embedded in Mr Gould’s wallpaper.

At Macclesfield magistrates court, Mr Jackson was cleared of trespassing with a shotgun.

Chairman of the bench Brian Titford said: 'This has been a difficult case with many grey areas. It’s not in dispute you were in land in possession of a shotgun and you found a dead sheep with the dog in the vicinity.

'You had strayed from a public footpath thus trespassing. However given the lead up you had reasonable excuse.'

Today Mr Gould, a tenant at the farm for 11 years, said: 'I’m just so disappointed with the verdict and it just sends out a message for people to go onto other people’s property armed with a shotgun and shoot their animals.

'I don’t believe for one minute my Poppy mauled that sheep. She could not have had the physical strength to drag a ewe down by its throat. Poppy wasn’t a big dog and she did not kill that ewe.'

He added: 'Poppy was not only my pet dog but my best friend and she has been by my side for seven years. We were virtually inseparable.

'Yet he just went out of his way to shoot her without telling me what happened first. He didn’t have to kill her.

'My frustration is that only two people know what happened - me and him. It’s difficult because it’s one word against another.'

The incident occurred on November 18 last year when Mr Gould, who lived alone, was in his milking parlour and heard two shots outside.

He left the parlour to see gunsmoke, his dog lying dead on the lawn, and Mr Jackson stood at the end of a silage clamp.

Shooting: David Gould's farmhouse in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where his dog was shot dead by his trespassing neighbour Alan Jackson

He said: 'It was about 8am and I heard two loud blasts - I thought something had exploded in the house but when I ran outside I saw the gun smoke and smelled the cordite.

'I looked up and saw someone walking away with a shotgun - and there was Poppy lying flat near the fence. I thought, what the hell is she lying like that for? It was as if she was asleep.

Damage: A smashed window at David Gould's farm which he claims was broken when his dog was killed

'I went up and then I realised she was dead - I couldn’t believe it.

'I did see Poppy in the field earlier but think she was just sniffing the ewe - which I think had been dead for a while. She certainly wasn’t killing the animal.

'If she had been viciously attacking the ewe she would have been a mess -she would have had blood round her mouth and fleece stuck to her - but there wasn’t any.

'I asked him what he was doing carrying a loaded shotgun and he said he always does.

'Even if my dog had done this. I said I would have paid him back twice over but he said: "they all say that". It was as if he didn’t give a damn.

'If there had been an Alsatian on my land and I followed it to the nearest residential area and shot it in someone’s garden, I’m sure I would be locked in jail straight away. I feel like the one being punished here. I miss Poppy so much.'

Mr Jackson, of Old Parks Farm, Gawsworth, told the court he saw the dog attacking the sheep as he drove past the field in his Land Rover and resorted to shooting the hound to protect his flock - which the law allows farmers to do.

He said he opened fire on the dog whilst it was in the field then followed and shot it once more to 'finish it off” as the injured animal struggled up a bank on Mr Gould’s land.

In court his lawyer Gwn Lewis said: 
'Mr Jackson didn’t take any pleasure from this. He followed the dog and 
despatched it to stop it killing his sheep and to stop its pain.”

Mr Jackson himself said: 'I could see the dog on the sheep and the first thing I did was shoot it between the shoulder and ear.

'I was always led to believe a dog could be shot after worrying livestock - especially on my land.

'At
the end of the day, it’s over with and I just want to draw a line under
it. I’m a commercial sheep farmer, I am not proud of it, we have an 
on-going problem with losing sheep because of dogs attacking - the most 
we lost at one time was 31.'
