A nature lover was fighting for his life tonight after being attacked by a wild stag in the countryside.

The man in his 40s suffered serious injuries at Saron in Carmarthenshire, West Wales, when he was impaled by the deer’s antlers, before another rambler raised the alarm and the fire service arrived.

They were followed by paramedics, who then called the air ambulance - and a doctor on board anaesthetised the man and carried out emergency on-the-spot surgery to stem the flow of blood.

He was airlifted almost 40 miles to Morriston Hospital in Swansea for further urgent surgery following the attack yesterday morning - and has been listed in a ‘critical but stable’ condition.

A Welsh Air Ambulance spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The crew were called down to a very rural area of West Wales. They were already co-responders with the fire service and ambulance on scene.

‘They requested the helicopter, which is currently carrying a doctor. He was able to recognise the man needed life-saving treatment and carried out a surgical procedure on the farmyard.

‘We normally carry a pilot and two 
paramedics, so it’s rare for a doctor to be on the aircraft. The boys 
were saying it was a stag who had attacked this gentleman and left him 
with multiple injuries.’

On the rise: Numbers of red deer in Wales have been on the increase and a cull was carried out last winter when more than 1,000 were killed (file picture)

He added that the air ambulance was requested by the emergency services at 9.10am yesterday, landed on the scene at 9.30am, left the scene at 10.35am, and landed at the hospital at 10.50am.

Numbers of red deer in Wales have been on the increase and a cull was carried out last winter when more than 1,000 were killed.

Last Thursday, a motorcyclist in his 70s was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries after hitting a deer on the A3400 near Shipston-on-Stour in Warwickshire.
