A spectacular 16.5-acre estate originally part of George Washington's famed Mount Vernon is up for sale for a presidential $25 million, despite needing renovations.

Steeped in American history, the waterfront property, located in Alexandria, Virginia, is on the market for the first time in half a century.

NamedÂ River View Estate after its 383 feet of uninterrupted vistas of the Potomac River, the residence makes plain why Washington once proclaimed: 'I had rather be on my farm than emperor of the world.'

The estate boasts a 6,000-square foot manor home, 2,000-square foot guest house, four-car garage, carriage house and staff quarters that are, according to the listing 'poised for modern renovations.'

George: The founding father himself never slept in the historic building, pictured, though his personal secretary lived and died here and it was in the Washington family until 1859

Three owners: The estate, pictured, has only had three owners including Tysons Corner developer Jerry Halpin who is selling it after more than 50 years

President: George Washington, shown in a 1796 painting by Gilbert Stuart, once famously proclaimed: 'I had rather be on my farm than emperor of the world'

Despite its feeling of seclusion, the 
six-bedroomed, four full and two half-bathroomed home is just minutes 
from Old Town Alexandria, Northern Virginia and Washington D.C.

The founding father himself never 
slept in the historic building though his personal secretary lived and 
died here and it was in the Washington family until 1859.

Since then, only two others have owned
the property, the latest being Tysons Corner developer Jerry Halpin who
snapped it up in 1962.

The county manor was listed by TTR
Sotheby's on Friday and since then there have already been inquiries of 
'intense interest,' one of the agents told The Washington Post, so if 
you're in the market for a piece of history get in quick.

Site map: The property is spread over 16.5-acres and consists of three houses

Renovation: Sotheby's listing mentions the property is 'poised for modern renovations'

Interest: Since the estate was listed on Friday there have already been inquiries of 'intense interest'

Sunset: The new owner will particularly enjoy watching the sun set by the river from the home

Mount Vernon: George Washington's family owned the River View Estate on Mount Vernon until 1859
