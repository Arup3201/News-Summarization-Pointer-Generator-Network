Roy Hodgson will order his players to sacrifice their egos for the good of the nation as the England boss steps up his preparations for Brazil.

Hodgson admits this squad might as well give up on the World Cup if they can’t commit to the team unity he demands — even those who are not in the side.

‘We know our only chance of success is as a team, together,’ said Hodgson. ‘There’s no chance for any team in the World Cup if they’re not together. ‘We’ve seen that in the past, like France in the last one, with all the problems coming out.

‘When you stand in front of a group of
 players for the first time and say, ‘‘Listen, the only way we’re going 
to win this is as a team” you will find 20 of them saying, “Yeah, yeah, 
right’’.

‘But then, if they
 don’t start doing it as a team in the course of the tournament, you’re 
quite entitled to say, “You didn’t say anything about this before, you 
were the first to say you agreed and now you’re out of the team, it’s a 
big problem and it’s not about the team any more, it’s all about you”. 
If you want to win a tournament, you’d better make certain you are all 
together.’

England arrived in Portugal on Monday to start their five-day training camp at the Vale do Lobo resort.

‘You
 can’t control those hazardous moments, like Steven Gerrard letting the 
ball run under his foot and slipping,’ added Hodgson.

‘It won’t happen often but when it happens, it happens. The thing you 
can control is your  teamwork, making sure you choose players who are 
prepared to work as a team and deal with problems that come up from 
individuals that are trying to eat away at the fabric of your team and 
maybe destroy your teamwork.’

A not-so-familiar face pictured arriving with skipper Gerrard was sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters.

Dr
 Peters, who has worked with Liverpool, Team GB's cycling team and 
snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan, will help Hodgson's men deal with the 
pressure on the biggest stage in Brazil.

After their training camp, England will return to London for their first preparation game against Peru at Wembley on May 30.

The
 Three Lions then travel to Miami where they will face Ecuador on June 
4, two days after all teams must name their final 23-man squads for the 
World Cup.

Honduras will be their opponents in their last preparation friendly on June 7, before they fly to Brazil the following day.
