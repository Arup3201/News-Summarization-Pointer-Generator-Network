Sports stars and their Twitter accounts…sometimes brilliant, occasionally controversial, often fist-bitingly ill-advised. 

From Mario Balotelli’s request for a kiss from the Queen, to the poignant #putoutyourbats Tweets in honour of Phillip Hughes, 2014 has been an eventful year for famous athletes and their social media accounts. 

Here are the highlights (and lowlights) from the past year.

Funnies

Mario Balotelli’s expert trolling of Manchester United after their shock 5-3 defeat by Leicester became the most retweeted tweet from a sports star in 2014.

George Groves was searingly honest following his defeat by Carl Froch in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley in May. You did get 'knocked the **** out,' George!

Colombia got knocked out by Brazil, James Rodriguez tweeted: ‘I can only say thank you Colombia.’ Not many failed to notice the massive grasshopper on his arm.

Balotelli again, and this time he was demanding a very particular prize if he helped England into the last-16 of the World Cup. Unfortunately he failed.

After Rory McIlroy dumped Caroline Wozniacki days after sending out wedding invites to friends, our Queen of Twitter got a (small) measure of revenge with this dig at McIlroy’s height.

Controversies

Rio Ferdinand replied to some ‘banter’ by insulting a Twitter user’s mum. The QPR defender was given a three-game ban by the FA for using the word ‘sket’ – a slang term for a promiscuous woman.

Radamel Falcao is proving a rather expensive occasional footballer for Manchester United. But two days before his switch to Old Trafford, the Colombian seemed to think he’d got his dream move to Real Madrid. The post was quickly taken down and Falcao denied he ever sent it…

Mario Balotelli’s endless off-field problems culminated in an incredibly ill-advised Instagram post containing anti-Semitic comments. The Italian later apologised, but was forced to serve a one-game ban.
