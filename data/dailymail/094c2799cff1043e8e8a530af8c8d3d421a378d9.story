Frank Holden, 66, says he is desperate to meet his granddaughter Hollie, almost two

He's been condemned as a cliche celebrity father – only resurfacing when his daughter was famous.

Frank Holden felt the full force of his daughter TV star Amanda’s venom in her new autobiography.

She told how, as an alcoholic, he abandoned his family when she was four, then years later tried to worm his way back into her affections.

But despite the attack he still wants the Britain’s Got Talent judge to give him another chance.

Yesterday he revealed that he had never seen Miss Holden’s youngest daughter  Hollie, who will be two in a few weeks. He has met her oldest child, seven-year-old Lexi, only once – when she was a baby.

The 66-year-old said: ‘It’s pretty obvious that I wasn’t a good father – which I regret.

‘The stuff which is written in the book is a long time ago and I would like them [Lexi and Hollie] and Amanda to spend time with me and learn about me now.

‘There has been no talk about seeing my grandchildren. I do send them Christmas cards and birthday cards. I don’t know if they get them, I never get any acknowledgement.

‘Amanda hasn’t physically banned me but it is an unwritten rule as, like she says in her book, she never wants to talk to me again.’

Mr Holden, who has recently retired from his job directing traffic to the Torpoint ferry in Cornwall, insisted he does not have a drink problem these days but admitted it was an issue in the past.

He said: ‘I hold my hands up. I used to drink too much, and I had a bad relationship with the drink.’ Miss Holden’s decision to freeze her biological father out of her life meant he had no idea she had suffered the trauma of a stillborn birth seven months into her second pregnancy in February 2011 until he read about it in the press.

Attack: In her autobiography she claims he abandoned her age four then re-emerged when she hit fame

He said: ‘When she lost her baby and was very poorly nobody told me. I would have liked to have known especially as she was so ill…she is my flesh and blood.’

In her autobiography No Holding Back, Miss Holden, 42, writes: ‘One of my strongest memories of Frank is the way he always smelled of alcohol. And the day I think he left. That day somewhere downstairs, Save All Your Kisses For Me by the Brotherhood Of Man was playing so I was bouncing in time to the music when Mum came into the bedroom with Frank. I bounced into his arms for a cuddle and smelt the alcohol on his breath.

‘Then he set me down without a word, turned around and walked out of the room.’

She continues: ‘He loved his booze more than he loved us and abandoned his children, pure and simple.’

Early years: Frank Holden with Judith, Amanda's mother, in 1973. His daughter claims he abandoned them

'I'm not bitter or sad, just disappointed that he only chose to come back into my life when I started to become "famous" and not when I'd actually needed him,' Amanda writes. But Frank claims he contacted her earlier

Miss Holden’s mother went on to marry Leslie Collistor who the actress refers to as her father. Years later, Mr Holden came to see his daughter perform in a production of The Sound Of Music and also  the West End musical Thoroughly Modern Millie in which she had the title role when she was 32.

Those encounters, however, served only to seal Miss Holden’s impression of her father as a cliche celebrity dad.

She said in her autobiography: ‘I’m not bitter or sad, just disappointed that he only chose to come back into my life when I started to become “famous” and not when I’d actually needed him.’ Mr Holden disputes this. He said: ‘When I got in touch with her she was just starting out and in the theatre performing. I haven’t latched on because she’s famous. That is a little hurtful and unfair.’

Miss Holden’s lifestyle could not be more different from that of her father. She lives in a £4million home in London with second husband Chris Hughes, 40, and their two daughters. He lives in a £160,000 house with his partner Pauline Long, 73.

Miss Holden’s agent yesterday declined to make a comment on her behalf.
