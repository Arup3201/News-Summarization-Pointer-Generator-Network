David Beckham's plans to build a 20,000-seat arena in Miami’s Museum Park for his MLS team have been compared with attempting to ‘build a stadium in Hyde Park’ by protest groups.

Beckham has a soccer franchise in Miami and intends to build a  10-storey stadium in Museum Park, which runs alongside Biscayne Bay in the heart of Miami’s waterfront district.

Dalia Lagoa, president of the association at 900 Biscayne, said to the Miami Herald on Monday: ‘It was always meant to be parkland. I can’t imagine Beckham going to the mayor of London and asking to put a soccer stadium in Kensington Park, in St James’ Park or in Hyde Park.

Big plans: David Beckham has proposed a new MLS franchise in Miami with a 20,000 seater stadium

‘He’ll get run out of town.’

Local architect Raul Rodriguez added: ‘It’s like landing a flying saucer in the middle of the park. It’s an abomination.’

Terence
 Riley, another prominent local architect, described the proposed 
development as  ‘mind-boggling’, ‘preposterous’, ‘misguided’ and ‘kind 
of crazy’.

Beckham
 has plans for a 20,000-seat stadium, with up to 25 events a year, 
although locals are sceptical whether it would ever be full.

Despite
 the fierce local opposition, Beckham, who remains hugely popular in the
 United States after his career with LA Galaxy, is determined to press 
ahead with his plans, which he says will create many new jobs in the 
area.
