A bronze statue was unveiled in France today in tribute to the U.S. war hero who inspired the book and award-winning television series 'Band of Brothers'.

The unveiling of the Colorado-made statue of Major Dick Winters was one of many events marking the 68th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied operation that paved the way for the end of the war.

The 12ft-tall bronze statue in the Normandy village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont shows Major Winters, played by English actor Damien Lewis in the acclaimed miniseries, with his weapon at the ready.

But Major Winters - of Ephrata, Pennsylvania, who died last year aged 92 - only accepted serving as the statue's likeness after monument planners agreed to dedicate it to the memory of all junior U.S. military officers who served that day.

'There were many Dick Winters in this war, and all deserve the bronze and glory of a statue,' said former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, present as the bronze statue, draped in a camouflage parachute, was unveiled.

Also attending were four or five D-Day vets, including two who served in the major's 'Easy Company,' Al Mampre and Herb Suerth Junior.

Major Winters 'was a humble, simple person thrust into a position of leadership in which he excelled,' said Mr Suerth, who heads the association of former Easy Company vets, only 19 of whom survive.

The statue was made near Boulder, Colorado, and transported here, to a roadside between the village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and Utah Beach, distant but visible behind the statue.

It was here that Winters and his small band of men dropped out of the sky soon after midnight on June 6, 1944, on a death-defying mission to destroy four German 105mm artillery guns that threatened the Allied invasion force.

Major Winters 'was a humble, simple person thrust into a position of leadership in which he excelled,' said Herb Suerth Junior, a D-Day veteran who heads the association of former Easy Company vets, only 19 of whom survive.

During the ceremony various WWII-era military aircraft flew overhead, including a U.S. artillery spotting plane just like those that would have darted through the skies on D-Day.

Francois Hollande also become the first French President in history to visit the graves of thousands of British soldiers who died liberating his country on D-Day.

He paid a visit to the Ranville Cemetery which contains the graves of 2564 British soldiers, many of whom were members of the 6th Airborne Division who died in the early hours of June 6th 1944 after landing by glider and parachute.

Mr Hollande’s decision to place a commemorative wreath in the village near Caen, Normandy, will help lay to rest past accusations that the French have underplayed the British contribution to victory in World War Two.

As rain poured down at the end of his visit, Mr Hollande smiled broadly and said: ‘The rain doesn’t matter, being here does.’

He shook hands with Parachute Regiment veterans, as well as serving British and French Army soldiers.

In previous years, French D-Day commemorations have concentrated on American invasion beaches, and on the sacrifice of Free French and Resistance forces.

'The President is, like millions of French people, hugely indebted to the British,’ said a source in Mr Hollande’s ruling Socialist Party.

'Their airborne division was responsible for the first liberation of a town on D-Day, and that’s why Mr Hollande wanted to be in Ranville to pay tribute.'

Mr Hollande was joined in Ranville by Britain’s Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, and the pair attended a commemorative service and laid wreaths.

In 1944, Britain's 6th Airborne Division took part in a daring raid to capture two heavily defended bridges across the River Orne and Caen Canal on D-Day.

An assault group made up of men from the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry landed in six gliders, earning themselves a place in military folklore which was immortalised in the classic war film The Longest Day.

Following liberation, the Ranville churchyard was immediately used to bury those who were killed, before an official cemetery was opened next to it after the war.

Jean-Luc Adelaide, the mayor of Ranville, said that French president Vincent Auriol had visited nearby Benouville in 1948, but that no head of state had ever visited the cemetery at Ranville, either on D-Day or on any other day.

As well as the thousands of British servicemen and 76 Canadians, those lying in Ranville also include 330 German soldiers.

There was controversy in 2009 when, on the 65th anniversary of D-Day, Buckingham Palace said there would be no members of the Royal Family at commemorations because they had not been invited by the French.

Instead, the then president Nicolas Sarkozy took part in commemorations at the U.S. Omaha Beach.

Eyebrows were raised when some French officials referred to the event as ‘primarily a Franco-American ceremony’.

Admiral Christian Brac de la Perriere, the president of the Committee of the Landings, the official French body for commemorating D-Day, welcomed Mr Hollande’s presence at Ranville.

He said it would be a ‘major spotlight two years before the 70th anniversary of the landings which we are due set to commemorate in 2014.’

The D-Day landings and the subsequent Battle of Normandy opened the road to Paris for the Allies and signaled the beginning of the end of the four year Nazi occupation of France.

Diplomatic sources in Paris confirmed that  Mr Hammond would be in Ranville with Mr Hollande.
