There's nothing like sipping a glass of bubbly on board a flight to an exotic destination.

However, while most economy passengers will enjoy a drink cramped in their seats, for those who turned left as they boarded, it's another story altogether.

Many of the world's top airline's offer on-board bars, where, for a seat at a price, passengers can sit on comfy chairs at the bar or lazy on luxury sofas while having their favourite tipple delivered. 

The Emirates A380 Airbus' lounge is exclusive for business class passengers, and is stocked with fine wines and spirits, such as Woodford Reserve American Whiskey. There's even a dedicated bartender on board to whip up your favourite cocktail.

Not to be outdone, the Qatar Airways A380 model boasts a spacious lounge and bar on its upper deck. Business and first class passengers can enjoy the fully-stocked bar, leather seating, and fresh flowers, all of which provide 'an escape from the typical airplane environment'.

For Etihad's Diamond First Class passengers,  each suite is fully equipped with a personal mini-bar. However, should you prefer to socialise with the other guests, first and business class travellers will have access to The Lobby, an in-flight fully-serviced lounge.

Korean Air's Celestial Bar is located at the rear of the plane's all-business class upper deck. Accessible for all business and first class customers, the bar is sponsored by Absolut Vodka and accordingly offers six signature cocktails, such as the Absolut Raspberry Delight and the Absolut Pear Deluxe.

Virgin Atlantic offers on-board bars on all of its aircraft, which are exclusively for upper class passengers. The newest is in its A330 - it's fully separate from the cabin and is the longest bar in the sky. Nevertheless, all of its bars offer high-end spirits like Bombay Sapphire Gin and Grey Goose Vodka, as well as an extensive selection of red and white wine, Prosecco and snacks.

Virgin Australia's Boeing 777 recently introduced one of the country's most luxurious domestic business class offerings, so it's no surprise that these aircraft also boast a top bar for both domestic and long-haul flights. Face-to-face service is offered for up to four seated guests, though additional lounge seating is located behind the bar.
