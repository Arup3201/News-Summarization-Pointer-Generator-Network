A Sydney couple killed in a tragic crash said they were delighted to be having a third child through IVF, sources have revealed.

Mr Milnes wife Susana Estevez-Castillo was about six months pregnant with their third son, reports News.com.  

It comes as police continue investigations into whether the fatal car crash, which left three family members dead and a young child fighting for his life, was deliberately caused by the father Darren Milne, who was driving the vehicle.

Darren and Susana Milne were driving with their two sons in a silver Toyota station wagon heading north on Enterprise Drive at Berkeley Vale on the NSW Central Coast on Sunday afternoon when the car veered off the road and hit a tree

'She was so excited about the pregnancy, they were just thrilled,' said the friend of the couple.'They had been trying for a while and had IVF. They really really wanted another child and they were just delighted and really looking forward to the baby coming.'

The couples youngest son Benjamin was rushed to The Children's Hospital at Westmead. He is in an induced coma, with head, back and internal injuries. 

The Milne family were travelling north along Enterprise Drive in Berkeley Vale on the NSW Central Coast on Sunday when their car left the road.

The vehicle ploughed into a tree whilst travelling somewhere between 90 and 100 km/h.

Sydney residents Darren Milne, 42, his wife Susana, 39, and their eldest son Liam, 11, were all killed in the crash, whilst their 7-year-old son was airlifted to Westmead Children's Hospital in a critical condition.

Seven News report that Ms Milne was pregnant with the couple's third son. 

The seven-year-old crash survivor has undergone surgery for extensive head and internal injuries and whilst he is still critical, his condition has stabilised.

Police allegedly 'have evidence that the father Darren deliberately drove off the road and into a tree', according to Seven News.

An investigation is underway with evidence being collected for the coroner to determine whether the crash was an intentional murder-suicide or a tragic accident. 

Nine News also allege that strongest line of inquiry is whether Mr Milne intentionally failed to brake.

The 42-year-old male driver and his wife aged in her late 30s, along with their 6-year-old son died at the scene

Investigators searched the family's Ryde home and seized a computer and documents.

Police allegedly found evidence that Mr Milne had been researching the Berkely Vale road where the accident occurred in the days leading up to their deaths, according to Seven News. 

Immediately after the accident, Tuggerah Lakes duty officer Inspector Colin Lott said, 'There are many scenarios that could be run by here — it could be inattention, it might be tiredness, so it's far too early to speculate at this stage,' he said.

'It was not a savage turn and the car was only a few metres off the road,' Inspector Lott said. 'Most likely the driver turned to speak to the children.' 

'We would be neglectful if we didn't search the house or look for a suicide note,' Inspector Lott said.

'We have to tick all the boxes. Part of the investigation is to eliminate all possibilities.'

It is understood police did not find a suicide note but were seen removing other material from the house. 

Police had trouble locating the Milnes' next of kin, including Ms Milne's family who are in Mexico.

Mr Milne was a senior engineer with Ausgrid, wife a fulltime carer for their children who had special needs, both struggling with Fragile X syndrome.  

NSW police Insp. Colin Lotte told reporters on Sunday: 'It's always a difficult scene for any fatality but to see potentially a whole family lost makes it even more distressing.'
