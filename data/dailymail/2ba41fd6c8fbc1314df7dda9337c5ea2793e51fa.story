Perhaps he was inspired by the success of David Bowie’s comeback.

But when Sir Paul McCartney released his latest album, it was no match for The Thin White Duke’s chart-topping efforts.

Instead, the former Beatle’s latest offering charted at number 18 in the UK iTunes chart yesterday, behind controversial singer Miley Cyrus, British singer songwriter James Blunt and pop band The Saturdays.

Despite months of publicity and interviews from the veteran rocker, New, his first album to feature original songs since 2007, didn’t reach the top ten in the digital downloads chart – the biggest retailer of music.

It is in stark contrast to fellow musician David Bowie, whose comeback album immediately peaked at number one in the iTunes chart within hours of its release in March this year. It was his first material in ten years and went on to top the charts in 60 countries around the world.

Sir Paul, 71, has engaged in months of publicity to push the album, which was produced by Mark Ronson, known for his work with Amy Winehouse, Ethan Johns, the son of legendary Wings producer Glyn Johns, and Giles Martin, whose father is former Beatles producer Sir George Martin.

However, it appears as though the constant promotional work undertaken by McCartney has succeeded in one respect; a compilation album of Beatles Hits, 1, has re-entered the US  iTunes chart, and by last night had made it to number 69.

Describing the album, the 16th of his solo career, McCartney has stated that the record was inspired by events including his marriage to Nancy Shevell as well as his early days as a musician before he found fame with the Beatles.

The album has been widely praised by critics, one of whom described the title track as a ‘jaunty, Beatles-esque stomp’ and likening it to Beatles hit ‘Got to Get You Into My Life’.

By this evening, the album had slipped to number 21 in the UK iTunes chart, but the position of albums and singles can change from hour to hour depending on sales.

The Official Charts Company, which provides the charts based on the number of physical copies sold, will be announced on Sunday.

Sir Paul’s last album, Kisses on the Bottom, featuring covers of classic pop songs, entered the UK charts at number 3 when it was released last year. His previous album, Memory Almost Full peaked at number 5 when it was released in 2007.
