Fallen hero: Jimmy Savile on a mini trampoline at Broadmoor in 1991

Jimmy Savile chaired a ‘task force’ set up by the Department of Health in 1988 to investigate concerns over the way Broadmoor Hospital patients were treated by staff.

But staff claim that before his appointment Savile had taken teenage girls plucked from Top Of The Pops shows to the hospital, where he was a volunteer.

Savile’s official title was Broadmoor’s honorary entertainments manager but staff say he stalked the corridors of the high-security mental hospital in Berkshire with swaggering impunity.

In the early Seventies, he liked to frequent the staff social club, housed in a drab single-storey brick building.

Bizarrely, among his guests one night were two members of the dance troupe Pan’s People. ‘It can’t have been the most glamorous watering hole they’d visited,’ a former Broadmoor nurse said. ‘Jimmy had the run of the place, he did as he pleased.’

Against this background, rumours about the entertainer circulated among staff. One souce said he took ‘trusted’ patients out for day trips in his Rolls-Royce and spoke of his sexual fascination with dead bodies. The source, a daughter of a principal nursing officer, told The Mail on Sunday he ‘liked to have his way’ with young females visiting their relatives. Standing at the main gate ‘in his swimming trunks, gold chain and sunglasses’, he would entice the ‘poor dears’ with the promise of a cup of tea in his caravan.

Savile’s behaviour caused friction with staff who felt he was undermining security.

A senior member of the Prison Officers Association said: ‘Savile had the run of the place. He would walk into the most secure areas containing the most dangerous patients in the UK. He was told these men and women were dangerous, but he just laughed it off and did his own thing.

‘He had friends in high places in Broadmoor and they swept concerns about him under the carpet.’

Staff who worked at Broadmoor at the time claim that Jimmy Savile took girls from Top of the Pops to the hospital

Alan Franey who was appointed chief executive of the high-security mental hospital in 1989, said the committee that Savile headed ‘was set up to review the way patients were being looked after’. He went on: ‘It was partly in response to a report advising that staff had been treating patients inappropriately, though not sexually.’

Mr Franey said that during his tenure as chief executive he was unaware of the allegations against Savile.

'He did as he pleased': Jimmy Savile took patients out for day trips in his Rolls Royce

Last week, the Department of Health launched an internal inquiry into its management of the hospital before it was transferred to West London Mental Health Trust in 2001.
