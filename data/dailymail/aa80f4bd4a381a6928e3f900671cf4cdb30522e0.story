In an effort to mark Guinness World Record Day, two German men have gotten their stomach into knots trying to speed eat a German food icon.

Unfortunately, the two men failed their first World Record attempt: downing a pretzel in 30 seconds without any water.

However, a winner was eventually declared - one minute and 12 seconds later than his initial attempt target.

After taking their seats, the two contestants chose their pretzels, rubbed off the salt and waited for the timer to start.

Realising the difficult task ahead, both men folded their pretzels - attempting to trick their minds into believing they only had half the amount in front of them left to eat.

Their mind trick didn’t appear to help though, as neither men were quick to finish after the fold.

Struggling: Alexander struggled to keep eating the pretzel, without any water, even after scraping off the salt and folding it in half

Eyes on the prize: Alexander's fellow competitor couldn't help but check how the eventual winner was getting along with the task at hand

Open Wide! Before declaring him the winner, the official from Guinness World Records had to inspect that Alexander had swallowed all of the pretzel

Eventually, after three attempts, Alexander scored the World Record with his pretzel scoffing time of one minute and 42 seconds.

The men attempted the feat to mark Guinness World Record Day on Thursday at a shopping centre in Sulzbach, outside Frankfurt.
