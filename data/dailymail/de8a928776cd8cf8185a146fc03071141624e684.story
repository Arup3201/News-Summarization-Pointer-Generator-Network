Homicide has fallen off the list of America’s top 15 causes of death for the first time in 45 years.

Killings dropped by 3.6 per cent in 2010 and were overtaken at number 15 by a respiratory illness called pneumonitis that is seen mainly in people aged 75 and older, government health officials said.

This is the first time since 1965 that homicide failed to make the list - and the news comes as U.S. life expectancy hit a new record high of 78.7 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

The infant mortality rate dropped to an all-time low of 6.14 deaths per 1,000 births in 2010, after it stood at 6.39 per 1,000 in 2009, according to the CDC's latest annual report on deaths.

Homicides fell to 5.3 cases for every 100,000 people. ‘Most of the changes were positive,’ report author Sherry Murphy, of the National Center of Health Statistics, told CNN.

Meanwhile U.S. life expectancy for a child born in 2010 was about 78 years and 8 months, up about a little more than one month from life expectancy for 2009.

The national death rate fell to 746 deaths for every 100,000 people in 2010, from 750 in 2009.

Heart disease and cancer remain the 
top killers, accounting for nearly half the nation's 2,465,932 deaths in
2010. But the death rates from them continued to decline.

Deaths
rates for five other leading causes of death also dropped in 2010, 
including strokes, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, 
flu or pneumonia and blood infections.

But death rates increased for Alzheimer's disease - the nation's sixth-leading killer - for kidney disease (#8), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (#12), Parkinson's disease (#14) and pneumonitis.

Homicide has historically ranked fairly low on the list. Its highest ranking in the past decade was 13th in 2001 - and that was due in part to the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington D.C.

Murder rates have been decline in recent years in New York City; Detroit, Michigan; Washington D.C. and elsewhere. New York saw 499 murders in 2011, which was down from 523 in 2010.

Murders there in 2010 were up 13 per cent - but the figure was still the fourth lowest since city records began in 1962. The record low was 471 in 2009 and the record high was 2,245 in 1990.

There were 297 homicides in Los Angeles, California, last year - which is a massive drop from when more than 1,000 killings happened in 1992 during the city's major drug epidemic, reported NPR.

It was long thought that violent crime increased in a troubled economy, which happened in the 1970s, but criminologists say the recent declines could simply be thanks to better police work.
