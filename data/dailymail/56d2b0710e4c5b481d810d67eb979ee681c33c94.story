Barcelona club captain Xavi looks set to leave the Catalan giants for Qatar, with Al Sadd confirming the deal is all but signed.

Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo have claimed 'Destination Qatar' with the 35-year-old poised to sign a three-year deal worth around £7m a season.

Mundo Deportivo reports that Al Sadd announced Xavi had already signed for next season, although they later back tracked and said it will be announced in 'his own time.'

The Spanish paper also claims Barcelona will give 'total freedom' to their legendary captain, who has won 22 major trophies with Nou Camp club during a magnificent career, to do 'what he considers appropriate.'   

Xaxi has played for Barca a record 751 times since he graduated from their academy to the first team in 1998 but has had limited game time this season under coach Luis Enrique.

The 35-year-old has a contract at Barcelona until 2016 but now looks set to play his last ever game for the club either against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey cup final in the Nou Camp on May 30, or in the Champions League final in Berlin on June 6 should Enrique's side progress that far.

Spanish newspaper AS hail 'Superbale' after his brace guided Wales to a 3-0 win in Israel on Saturday

Meanwhille AS have branded Wales hero Gareth Bale 'SuperBale' after Real Madrid's forward scored twice to guide his country to a 3-0 Euro 2016 qualifying victory in Israel on Saturday.

AS reported 'He amazes in Israel', having scored a brace and provided an assist for Aaron Ramsey.

Marca also heaped praise on the Welshman with 'Great match from Bale as he played with freedom of movement.'

That's quite a turn around for the much maligned Galactico after Marca scored him a zero after the El Clasico defeat by Barcelona last weekend.
