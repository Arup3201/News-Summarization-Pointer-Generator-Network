When a UFO spotter sent a local news team his film of mysterious spacecraft whizzing above Denver, Colorado, they sent their own cameraman out to prove it was a hoax.

But after a few hours of filming from 
the exact same spot, the team captured footage that, far from debunking 
the strange sighting, appears to confirm it.

The city's Fox-affiliated TV station KDVR have no explanation, even after drafting in an aviation expert in a final bid to disprove the phenomenon.

Amateur footage: This is a still from the video sent to the TV station by an amateur UFO spotter

Pro footage: This is the video shot by the professional photojournalist for Fox-affiliated TV channel KDVR

But after reviewing the footage, Steve Cowell told the team: 'That is not an airplane, that is not a helicopter, those are not birds, I can't identify it.'

The original video, sent by a man who refused to be identified, seems to show a series of dark objects flying at high speed in and out of clouds.

He captured the images using his digital camera from a hilltop in Federal Heights, downtown Denver.

Stumped: In a bid to verify the film, KDVR enlisted the help of former pilot, instructor and FAA accident prevention advisor Steve Cowell, but he was unable to identify it

He said they appeared between noon 
and 1pm at least two or three times a week and fly so fast they can 
barely be seen by the naked eye. Instead he had to slow the film down to
 catch a real glimpse.

'You can see them coming in real fast and then they do a little whoop-dee-doop,' he told the channel.

In a bid to verify the film, KDVR enlisted the help of former pilot, instructor and FAA accident prevention advisor Mr Cowell.

But he told them he knew of no aircraft that flies that fast.

Residential: The UFO spotter said the objects appeared to be launching and landing in the Clay St & West 56th Avenue area, but it is a residential neighbourhood

'It is very strange,' he said, adding: 'Perhaps there is some sort of debris that is being raised up by some of the atmospheric winds.'

The Federal Aviation Administration told the station: 'The FAA have checked with air traffic control and no one has had any reports of the activity you have described.

'Nor have any of our employees observed any of this nature either visually or on radar displays.'

The North American Aerospace Defense Command have a base in the area, but a spokesman said they did not have any 'noted air activity' in the Denver area during the time in question.

The mystery continues.
