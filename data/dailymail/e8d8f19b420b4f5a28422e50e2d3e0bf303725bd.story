An acquaintance of the Colorado 'Dark Knight' gunman has been questioned by police over a phone threat to have the shooter released from jail.

Yeom Pyo Lee was sought by officials after police received a message from his telephone threatening violence if James Holmes was not released from police custody.

Lee, who is believed to be a student on the PhD course at the University of Colorado, Denver from which Holmes recently dropped out, was released without charge after questioning.

He came to the attention of the police when 'someone called from [his] phone and threatened violence if Holmes is not released', according to KDVR reporter Justin Joseph.

It is not known whether or not Lee was responsible for the communication.

His neighbours in Aurora said that there was a heavy police presence around the street where he lives, and officers repeatedly questioned residents as to his whereabouts.

Police finally talked to him on Saturday evening, but after the interview released a statement saying, 'There is no reason to believe that he is involved.'

Several sources have referred to Lee as a 'person of interest', but local police chief Daniel Oates told CBS: 'I'm not quite sure what the term person of interest means.

'This was a person who had contact with the suspect, a casual acquaintance. We found him yesterday, we interviewed him.'

He added: 'The relationship was really inconsequential and we're happy that we spoke to him. That's all that was.

'As a responsible part of this investigation we would be doing that with any of his acquaintances.'

Massacre: 12 people were left dead and 58 injured in the Colorado shooting

Lee, who is originally from South Korea, earned a master's degree in biomedical science from Hallym University, a private college in the city of Chuncheon, before moving to Colorado to study for his doctorate.

His Twitter profile reads: 'Like: YOU. CAMERA. APPLE. MOTOR VEHICLE. MUSIC. STEVE JOBS. Dislike: HYPOCRITE.'

He tweets prolifically about technology, which appears to be his principal interest.

Police have been unable to confirm a motive for Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 58 during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises early on Friday morning.

Early reports seem to indicate he acted alone, although one witness said he thought he saw someone prop open the emergency exit of the cinema ahead of Holmes's murderous assault.

The
witness said: 'As I was sitting down to get my seat, I noticed that a 
person came up to the front row, the front right, sat down, and as 
credits were going, it seemed like he got a phone call.

'So
he went out toward the emergency exit doorway, which I thought was 
unusual to take a phone call. And it seemed like he probably pried it 
open, or probably did not let it latch all the way.

'As
soon as the movie started, somebody came in, all black, gas mask, 
armour, and threw a gas can into the audience, and it went off, and then
there were gunshots that took place.'

Mr Oates, however, said that police were still acting on the assumption that Holmes did not have an accomplice.

'All
the evidence we have, every single indicator, is that this was all Mr 
Holmes's activity,' the police chief said. 'He wasn't particularly aided by anyone else.'
