A 17-year-old child porn suspect enrolled in an elementary school and pretended to be a 12-year-old using another child porn suspect to pose as his father.

Ricardo Javid Lugo, 17,  enrolled at Hurst Hills Elementary School in Hurst, Texas, in August using fake documents while Randy Ray Wesson, 28, posed as his father.

The pair allegedly planned to recruit potential victims from the school for both of them.

Police said Wesson also admitted to sexually abusing over 100 children between the ages of 7 and 14.

Arrested: Randy Ray Wesson, 28, (left)  was arrested on charges of possession with intent to promote child pornography along with 17-year-old Ricardo Javid Lugo who allegedly posed as a sixth grader 

According to an arrest affidavit, detectives said Wesson 'confessed that police would find approximately 42,000 child pornography images on his computer, thumb drive, phone and SD cards.'

It states: 'Wesson also admitted to sexually abusing over 100 children between the ages of 7-14 years of age. He identified 12 victims by name.'

During a search of Lugo's phone, officers found images of 'children at school, dated August 25 through 26, 2014.'

Documents also state a video on Lugo's cell phone dated August 31, 2014, shows Lugo spanking a child who appeared in a previous photograph taken at school, reports NBC DFW. 

Posing: An investigation revealed that Ricardo Javis Lugo, 17, has been enrolled in 6th grade at Hurst Hills Elementary in Texas since August and may have done so to capture child pornography 

In one message, Lugo told Wesson that he saw one child's genitals and 'talks about telling other kids not to tell, and having to follow them home to see where they live,' the affidavit said. 

'Ricardo tells Randy on September 12, 2013, that a kid told him he has always wanted someone to touch him and invited him over. Ricardo tells Randy, 'He said we could do it if I promise not tell, and I said the same thing,' the affidavit said, reports the Star Telegram.

According to the arrest affidavit, Lugo and Wesson met on Instagram in 2013 when Lugo was using the name Matthew and living in Mexico.

He apparently told Wesson he was 12-year-old and that he was unhappy at home in Juarez.

A few months later - either late February or early March, Wesson drove to El Paso, and took Lugo back to his home in Fort Worth with Wesson. 

Wesson told investigators he and Lugo have had a sexual relationship since that time.

Detectives interviewed Wesson's father Bruce and he told them he had caught his son looking at 'possible' child porn before.

He told police his son informed him that Lugo was 12-years-old - he said he was introduced to Lugo in February because his mother didn't want him, according to the affidavit.

Bruce told detectives that Lugo wore diapers and was called Matthew Drew Wesson. 

The investigation started when a online tip was sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on June 8 that associated an Instagram account with an email address connected to with Wesson, according to the arrest affidavit.

The center's staff searched websites for Wesson's email address and found statements like 'I want to be your daddy, I want to change your diaper,' according to the arrest affidavit. 

Acting on the tip, police searched Wesson's Fort Worth home and found child porn images.

According to a statement from the Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent School District, Lugo enrolled in August. 

District officials say Wesson posed as Lugo's father during the process and provided a birth certificate, immunization records, and proof of residency.

'Hurst Hills staff followed all procedures regarding enrollment when the student was enrolled in August,' the statement read. 

'There was no indication that the student's records were forged or that the student was too old to attend elementary school. 

'The student's behavior at school also did not raise any concerns.' 

They have contacted parents of sixth grade students on Wednesday to inform them of the news, and a letter was sent home with all Hurst Hills students.

A woman in El Paso positively identified Lugo as her son when a detective showed her a picture of him. 

In August she posted on Facebook saying her son had been missing from El Paso for the last six months.

Wesson faces charges of possession with intent to promote child pornography, sale/display of harmful material and tampering with a governmental record. 

He was in the Hurst jail Thursday night with bail set at $3 million.

Lugo faces charges of possession of child pornography. He was in the Hurst jail with bail set at $250,000.
