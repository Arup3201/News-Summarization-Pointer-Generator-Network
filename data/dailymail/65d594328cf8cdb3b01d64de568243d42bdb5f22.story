Bayern Munich proved they can be as impressive off the field as they are on it by paying off their stadium debt 16 years ahead of schedule.

Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge revealed the Bundesliga champions have 'completely paid off' the money borrowed to build the Allianz Arena.

Speaking to the club's magazine, Rummenigge said: 'In 2005 we borrowed exactly 346 million euros (£275m) in a 25-year plan, which was meant to last until 2030.

'Now we have paid the stadium off after only nine years. I'm very proud of that.'

Arsenal borrowed a similar amount of money to build the Emirates Stadium, which opened in 2006. 

The Gunners' latest financial results indicated that, while they have cash reserves of £207m, they still have a significant debt to pay on their stadium, which they spend almost £35m servicing every year. 

Should Arsenal wish, they could use their cash reserves to pay off the majority of the money they owe for the Emirates, but the north Londoners prefer instead to save that money for player transfers and other costs 

Bayern share their 71,137-seat stadium, which opened in 2005, with second-division 1860 Munich.

1860 sold their 50 percent stake to its larger city rival in 2006, while maintaining the right to play games there.

The stadium, which is sponsored by a financial services company, is illuminated in red when Bayern plays, and blue when 1860 does.

Despite Arsenal having a net-debt of around £30m, they still pay around £35m a year on their stadium debt
