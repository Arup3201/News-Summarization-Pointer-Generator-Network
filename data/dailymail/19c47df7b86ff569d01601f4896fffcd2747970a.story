A rural township in south-central Pennsylvania is letting motorists know it's not a gun-free zone.

LNP reported Thursday that Conoy Township - just south of Harrisburg - is spending about $500 on the group of signs.

Four of them have been installed, with 12 more in the works. 

They'll eventually be posted along every road at the township's borders.

Too much or just enough?: Conoy Township in Pennsylvania have put up four of these signs along township roads and plan to hang 12 more, warning visitors they are armed. Seen here is supervisor Steve Mohr

Deterrent: Sign on Donegal Springs Road declaring Conoy Township not a gun-free zone. It is one of 16 going up around the township.

A township supervisor said he proposed the idea in response to home invasions and petty crime.

'We want to welcome people in, but we want to let them know that if they're here for criminal activity, they're not welcome,' Conoy Township supervisor Steve Mohr told KOB 4.

'(Criminals) might look at that sign and think, ''I might be about to have a bad day''.' 

Mr Mohr said the decision to erect the signs can via vote from the town's five supervisors.

However, critics are not convinced.

Pro-guns: Mr Mohr should the point of the signs is to deter crime

'These signs are silly, because the Second Amendment guarantees the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens anywhere to own guns in their homes,' Jonathan Hutson, a spokesman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, told Fox News.

'As a matter of fact, no jurisdiction in America completely prohibits the carrying of guns in public.'

Further, executive director of Cease Fire PA, Shira Goodman, said the signs are actually dangerous.

'The intent seems to be to scare those who might consider criminal activity,' Goodman said.

'The likely effect will be to embolden a shoot-first, Wild West mentality.'

But Mr Mohr is not affected by the people who don't agree with his signs.

He said that people don't realize the right to carry firearms has been curtailed in other parts of the country.

He believes its important to stand up for such rights.

At least one other town - Greenleaf, Idaho is considering following  Conoy's move.
