France captain Thierry Dusautoir has snubbed a move to Leicester and signed a two-year contract extension with Toulouse.

Tigers chief executive Simon Cohen revealed on Wednesday that the East Midlands club were in talks with the back-row who, Sportsmail understands, has now decided to remain in the Top 14.

Holding discussions overseas will no doubt have helped the flanker secure an improved deal with his club.

With forwards Tom Croft and Julian Salvi both out of contract this summer, Leicester had lined up the 33-year-old as a possible marquee signing to bolster their pack. 

But they will now have to look elsewhere after missing out on the 2011 IRB Player of the Year, who is one of his country's most respected sportsmen and wrote a column in response to the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris. 'I'm just a rugby player,' said Dusautoir. 'But I want to say what has kept me going since my early years, since I set up home in France from my native Ivory Coast, is camaraderie, togetherness.

'Mixed race, from a white French father and black Ivorian mother, my primary school years quickly taught me that I was more tanned than the others, that I had a strange accent where sometimes I'd roll my Rs too much, sometimes I'd swallow them. But my friends from Perigueux, they would laugh with me.

'Terrorists do not respect anyone. The minute of silence on our rugby fields this weekend, wanted by the federation and the League, will be our witness. I'm probably no more legitimate than others to speak but, as captain of France's rugby team and as a public figure, I will continue to defend the difference and fight for us to live together.'

Dusautoir will renew his rivalry with England captain Chris Robshaw during next month's Six Nations. The Harlequins flanker has recovered from a shoulder injury and will face Leicester on Saturday after five weeks on the sidelines.

Robshaw will start alongside veteran No 8 Nick Easter, who on Friday confirmed that he has agreed a two-year contract extension. At 36, he is one of his club's most experienced players and will make his 250th appearance at the Stoop this afternoon.

'I'm enjoying my rugby, looking to improve my game, and as long as I've got a desire and hunger for it, it's that simple,' Easter told Sky Sports. 'I've still got that thirst to continue the success we had for two or three years when we won three trophies. We didn't win anything last year and that drives you on as well.'

Easter's former England team-mate Tom May, 35, on Friday announced that he will retire at the end of the season. The London Welsh centre, who previously played alongside Jonny Wilkinson at Newcastle and Toulon, will be hoping to go out on a high after a miserable first part of the season with the Exiles.

'It's a tough decision and there's a certain amount of fear that goes with making that decision but also a huge amount of excitement,' said May.

'I've been lucky to play for some great clubs, Newcastle, Toulon, Northampton and to then have the opportunity to try and create something with London Welsh — getting out of the Championship and playing this season in the Premiership.'
