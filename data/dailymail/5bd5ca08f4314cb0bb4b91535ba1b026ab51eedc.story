Joe Alder suffered liver failure after taking low-dose antibiotics for three years to prevent bladder infections

A mother who took an antibiotic tablet every day claims she almost died after the drug triggered liver disease.

Joe Alder, 36, had been taking low-dose antibiotics for three years to prevent recurrent bladder infections.

But she was rushed to hospital in April last year when the whites of her eyes and her skin turned bright yellow.

Doctors discovered she had liver failure and Ms Alder claims she was nicknamed 'Marge Simpson' by hospital staff because of her jaundiced skin caused by the disease.

Thanks to a liver transplant she survived, but the effects have left her feeling 'like an old lady in a young woman’s body'.

Ms Alder, from Garstang, Lancashire, was prescribed the low-dose antibiotics after suffering recurring bladder infections.

'My doctor prescribed me this antibiotic on a low dose to stop me getting them,' she said.

'I had to take one tablet a night and had been taking them for about three years.

In some women, taking such a dose can reduce the occurrence of bladder infections by up to 95 per cent.

But of all types of prescription drugs, antibiotics are the ones most likely to cause liver damage, according to a study published in the journal Gastroenterology.

Ms Alder said: 'I didn't give the fact [I had been taking them so long] a second thought, as my doctor had prescribed them. I thought they were safe.'

But she was forced to return to the doctor in April last year after she began to feel unwell and vomit.

Her doctor suspected she had a gut infection and prescribed antibiotics, but two days later - when her skin turned yellow - she was rushed to hospital.

Ms Alder, who lives with fiance Andy McKendry, says: 'At the hospital, they took my bloods and then I saw a doctor who sent me home and told me to return four days later for an ultrasound.'

Ms Alder, 36, was given a massive dose of steroids to fight the liver damage. She is now out of the danger zone but suffers many side-effects as a result of them, including a bloated face, bad acne, weight gain, and muscle pain and weakness that has left her wheelchair bound (pictured left with medications to treat these symptoms)

But when Mr McKendry woke up the following morning to see her skin become bright yellow, he took her straight to A&E.

This time, she was admitted immediately and a blood test revealed that her liver inflammation 
results were in the thousands - when the normal marker should have been 
about 40.

Ms Alder claims she was told the low-dose antibiotic she had been taking was most 
likely responsible for triggering the liver disease.

Looking back, she said she had been feeling exhausted, but had blamed it on juggling family life with full-time work.

By the time she was diagnosed her 
condition was so dire she was referred to St James’s Hospital in Leeds 
and put on the liver transplant list. 

She
 said: 'I was so yellow that the nurses started calling me Marge out of 
the Simpsons and Andy began calling me "Dora The Explorer" because of my
 black bob and yellow skin.

'We
 kept our humour and positivity throughout it all. You have to keep 
smiling as, if you didn’t, it would all get too much for you.

'I
 started thinking about the future if anything happened to me and it got
 to the point where I sorted out wills and where the children would go. 
All I was thinking about was Andy and my children.'

Remarkably, Ms Alder, who has two teenage children - Josh, 17 and Chloe, 13 - says she managed to pull through without a liver transplant, thanks to intensive steroid treatment.

But she added her life has changed dramatically and her mobility has been reduced.

When she left hospital, she could barely walk and tests showed she had steroid induced myopathy - when the steroids weaken the muscles.

Ms Alder, a former project manager, said: 'I had all the side effects you get with the steroids, including a bloated face, bad acne, weight gain, not being able to walk and immense pain throughout my body.

'When I came off the steroids, my walking still wasn’t great and they are currently doing further tests as they believe the trauma may have kick-started another disorder.'

Fifteen months on, she says she still feels 'horrendous'.

“My mobility is still affected and although I am OK pottering around at home, when I go out, I have to use a wheelchair.

'I feel exhausted and suffer from chronic body pain which I have to take medication for.

'I really have to pace myself. I lost my job because of being poorly as I had to have so much time off and I would not be able to do that job now anyway.  feel like an old lady in a young woman’s body.'

She is now trying to raise awareness of the damage antibiotics can cause.

'My aim is to raise awareness of non-alcohol related liver disease and people like myself where taking prescription medication brought on the condition.

'I think anyone on regular prescribed medication should have regular blood tests to check body function to make sure they are not having an adverse effect.'
