The owner of the ski resort in Kazakhstan where Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas went on holiday is a wealthy oligarch with ties to the dictatorship's political elite.

The Shymbulak resort - where the young royal and his girlfriend were spotted recently - is part-owned by Serzhan Zhumashov, whose construction firm is the leading builder of luxury property in Kazakhstan.

The oligarch has admitted that he has partly prospered thanks to his political connections - saying that he operates in the 'grey area' between the country's private and public sectors. 

He has used his estimated £130million wealth to build links with the West - including opening a Kazakh offshoot of a leading English public school.

Kazakhstan has been led by president Nursultan Nazarbayev - an autocratic leader who has suppressed political opposition - ever since becoming independent from the USSR in 1991.

Mr Nazarbayev has been accused of human rights abuses including censorship and even torture - but he controversially hired Tony Blair as an adviser on a contract reportedly worth £8million.

Mr Zhumashov, believed to be 47, joined the country's finance ministry as soon as he left university, according to U.S. diplomats.  

In 1996 he went on to found Capital Partners, the construction company of which he remains chairman, and built up strong links with leading firms in the West.

Project: Mr Zhumashov built the resort in the mountains above Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city 

Among the projects masterminded by Mr Zhumashov's firm have been cinemas, fitness clubs and restaurant chains such as pizzerias, sushi bars and American-style diners.  

His businesses have helped meet the growing demand for a Western lifestyle in the ex-Soviet state where GDP per head is still below $10,000 (£6,000).  

However, Capital Partners' plans to build further ski resorts after the success of Shymbulak have attracted opposition from campaigners who claim they could prove an ecological disaster.  

Mr Zhumashov's most recent major project was the construction of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Almaty, the biggest city in Kazakhstan.  

The five-star hotel - which calls itself 'the first true luxury location in Kazakhstan' - is located at the top of Almaty's tallest skyscraper, and prices for its rooms start at around £200 per night.

The oligarch told U.S. diplomats that Capital Partners relies on 'the grey area where private investment and the government intersect', according to a 2008 document released by WikiLeaks.  

This suggests that Mr Zhumashov is close to the Nazarbayev regime, although he has also spoken out against the government at times.  

While most of his business investments have been in his native country, Mr Zhumashov has also bought property in the West - in 2010, he sold an apartment in Manhattan for $3million (£2million).  

He sent his son to Haileybury College in Hertfordshire, the £30,000-a-year boarding school attended by film director Christopher Nolan and former Prime Minister Clement Attlee.  

Mr Zhumashov helped Haileybury set up a pair of sister schools in Kazakshstan, Haileybury Almaty and Haileybury Astana, at a cost of at least $100million (£60million).  

When Haileybury Almaty first opened in 2008, Mr Zhumashov said: 'We decided to do it so our children could stay here and at the same time get the education that would allow them to enter any university.'  

He has expressed ambitions to team up with Ivy League universities in order to set up a business school and medical school in Kazakhstan.
