She's made no secret of her desire to conquer the fashion world - even enlisting husband Kanye West to give her wardrobe a makeover - and it seems Kim Kardashian's efforts are paying off. 

One of the industry's most acclaimed stylists, who works with Miley Cyrus, Rita Ora and Bruno Mars, has hailed the 33-year-old's style as 'flawless'.

Speaking to FEMAIL about who she thinks takes the style crown in Tinseltown, Alexis Knox said: 'Kim Kardashian is killing it. 

'She isn't putting a foot wrong and everyone I speak to - men and women - all love her and think she's brilliant. There's no one who doesn't think she looks amazing.'

Kim Kardashian has long wanted to conquer the fashion world and now Miley Cyrus and Rita Ora's stylist has hailed the reality TV star as the queen of fashion, saying she is 'killing it' with every look

And the super stylist thinks there's one man to thank: her husband, Kanye West. 

'Kanye came in and chucked out loads of her clothes and I think that's hilarious. He's so cool and he is helping reinvent her, which is awesome.

'I think it's great to empower men in fashion. In this day and age, it's good to see,' said Alexis, who is the official HTC Desire EYE selfie stylist. 

Kim, who now has the most esteemed designers on speed dial and has finally won plaudits in the fashion world - even landing a Vogue cover - revealed earlier this year that she was undergoing a style overhaul.

Kim told the world via social media that she would be overhauling her look for 2015 and Alexis Knox says she hasn't put a foot wrong so far, with every look being 'brilliant'

A veteran of the Balmain Army, we weren't surprised to see Kim Kardashian sporting yet another creation from the brand’s latest collection. Especially because we've spotted her in it before.

Opting for an all black ensemble, Kim teamed this boned Balmain zip up top with a pair of wide leg silk trousers and a fur gilet. Not forgetting the heels of course.

Whilst we're not sure Kim got the proportions right in this look, we are crushing hard on the sleeveless silk blend corset top. It accentuates her tiny waist and that zip is inspiring thoughts of Fifty Shades of Grey.

It's from the Balmain SS15 collection but is already available online to buy. How exciting is that? Click the link (right) to check it out now and if you're feeling flush then get out your credit card ladies because it's a whopping $3190.

Kim called on her husband Kanye, who has strong connections in the fashion world, to help reinvent her and he famously cleared out Kim's wardrobe 

Writing on her Twitter, the mother-of-one said: 'Up all night redoing my whole wardrobe with Kanye.....I'm so ready for new looks for the New Year! New 2015 vision.'

Of course, her new husband Kanye has played a large part in her style transformation.

Kim has spoken on many occasions about the rapper-come-designer's influence on her wardrobe choices.

Last year, Kanye introduced his wife to fashion label A.W.A.K.E. - and she loved it so much she wore it twice in four days.

The brand, which is actually run by Russian designer and Harper's Bazaar former fashion director, Natalia Alaverdian, was discovered online by Kim's husband, Mr West.

'He researches everything and he loves to find new talent, and he introduced me to her and told me she’s part Armenian, and so am I,' Kim told WWD.

'I’m all about empowering other women to be successful and it’s really important to me to support designers that I believe in and friends that I believe in that are hardworking.'

In one episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kanye is even seen clearing out her closet to make way for a sleeker look.

And it seemed his help worked. She has since been asked by Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue, to cover her CR Fashion book and is a firm favourite of style bible, LOVE magazine.
