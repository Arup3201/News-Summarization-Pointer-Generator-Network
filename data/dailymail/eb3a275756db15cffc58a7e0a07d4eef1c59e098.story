It’s surprising couples ever end up on holiday together.

Men and women want to visit totally different destinations for trips abroad, according to a new survey.

Men would rather opt for a European break over a long-haul holiday because they don’t like to travel for more than four hours.

At odds: Men would prefer destinations closer to home while woman are happy to travel long-haul

While women would happily travel for up to 12 hours to reach their dream holiday, with more than 60 per cent preferring long-haul trips to short-haul breaks.

A survey of 1,000 Brits by online travel agent Holiday Hypermarket found that men want to go to Turkey, Majorca, the Canary Islands, Egypt and Italy because they feel ‘more at home’ closer to the UK.

However, it’s holidays in Thailand, the Caribbean, Florida, Mexico and the Maldives that pique a woman’s interest.

Top destination: Women cite the Maldives as their fifth ideal holiday destination

The same report reveals when it comes to booking holidays, 58 per cent of women will be arranging their family break, compared to 42 per cent of men.

Nearly two thirds of men said they only wanted to go on holiday for 10 days, while women opted for two weeks.

Men feel ‘more at home’ when staying in short haul destinations and find going further afield ‘hard work’ on the plane.

Creature comforts: Men prefer short-haul destinations for holidays, such as Turkey

Even though they like going further afield women still like to look for a discount on the holiday with 40 per cent stating they will carry out research on the internet and find the best deal for them/their family. 

Kay Dixon from Holiday Hypermarket said: ‘Long-haul holidays are becoming increasingly popular and our latest research has confirmed what our own data shows – that women are booking the holidays and the dominant decision maker.  

‘It’s interesting that women in both couples and families want to go further afield as women’s sense of adventure grows.’
