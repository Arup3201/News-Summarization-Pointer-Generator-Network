Mystery: Russell Matthews reappeared after vanishing and being declared a missing person more than three months ago

Tragic details have emerged over the Coast Guard who suddenly reappeared after going missing for more than three months.

Petty Officer Russell Matthews, who worked as a rescue swimmer for the U.S. military branch, mysteriously disappeared last October; following an intensive three-day search, officials presumed the twice-married father of two was dead.

The 36-year-old officer went missing around the one-year anniversary of his wife’s suicide; in 2009, she had sustained significant brain damage from a biking accident.

His second wife reported him missing on October 9, 2012.

Officers said that Matthews, a 15-year veteran of the Coast Guard, was distraught at the time of his disappearance, leaving his car parked at Kaena Point in Oahu.

The only other traces of the officer rescue workers found were a pair of slippers, and his hat floating in the water.

It is still unclear where the 36-year-old officer has been during the past three months.

Matthews was incoherent when he showed up Sunday night at the home of his second wife; the couple live on the North Shore.

Tragedy: Clara and her children were involved in a head-on bicycling accident in 2009 and the mother suffered a traumatic brain injury; two years later, she committed suicide

Matthews, who had been transferred to 
the Tripler Army Medical Center, is now in military custody at Pearl 
Harbor, according to Coast Guard Spokesman Lt. Gene Maestas.

He said that the military branch is 
currently in the process of discharging Matthews for illegally using 
marijuana ahead of his disappearance. The Coast Guard was under 
investigation for it before he vanished in October.

Lt. Maestas added that Matthews is in 
custody because of his unauthorized absence. In addition, the mysterious
circumstances around his disappearance make him a flight risk.

Matthews had been married once before and tragically lost his first wife, Clara, in 2011.

The mother of his two children 
committed suicide in 2011 by shooting herself in the head; Matthews went
missing around the one-year anniversary of her death, according to KITV.

Loss: Clara Matthews suffered a traumatic brain injury following the accident and took her life two years later

Authorities
suspect that Matthews’ first wife pointed the gun at her head in part 
because of the traumatic brain injury she suffered two years prior in a 
bicycle accident.

According to reports at the time, Clara was hit by a car as she was riding her bicycle along the North Shore in Pupukea in March of 2009. Her two children, aged three and five, were riding along in a two-wheel trailer.

Clara and her children were seriously injured when a woman veered her sedan into the bike lane and hit the family head-on.

Treatment: The petty officer is now being evaluated at Tripler Army Medical Center

The mother was thrown from her bicycle and hit her head on the car’s windshield, while her children were pushed by the car around 80 feet.

According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Matthews was being investigated for marijuana use at the time of his disappearance.

Coast
Guard investigators dispatched to see him confirmed his identity after 
he called his command from Castle Medical Center in the Honolulu suburb 
of Kailua, Maestas said.

Matthews' children have been staying with Clara's family members on the mainland in his absence, KITV reports.

Under investigation: Matthews, pictured before his disappearance, was under investigation for alleged marijuana use

Police
found the 36-year-old guardsman's car abandoned at Kaena Point, a 
remote area of Oahu, when Matthews was reported missing in October.

Crews from the Coast Guard, Navy, 
state, county lifeguards and Honolulu fire and police departments 
together searched more than 10,000 nautical square miles - on land and 
at sea - for Matthews.

The search was called off on December 13, and Matthews was presumed dead.

Honolulu
Police Sgt. Kim Buffett of Crimestoppers said Matthews did not give the
police a statement because he had been in the hospital.

Detectives have no 
reason to pursue the case as it's not against the law to be missing, she
said. The police case is closed now that Matthews has been found, she added.

It's unusual for a Guardsman to go missing for months and then reappear, Lt Maestas said.

'This is not the norm for the Coast Guard. In my 28 year career in the Coast Guard, I have never come across a case like this,' he said.

Matthews has been stationed in Hawaii since 2007.
