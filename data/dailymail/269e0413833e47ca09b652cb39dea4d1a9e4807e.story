Boris Johnson today attacked the ‘multi-culti balkanisation’ of British society which means thousands of people do not speak English.

The London Mayor insisted people who come to the UK should learn the language, stressing it is ‘is unbelievably easy to get the hang of’.

He condemned the ‘disastrous approach’ of teaching children in other languages and the ‘nonsense’ of offering translated versions of official documents.

Census figures from 2011 show there were 138,000 people in England and Wales who could not speak any English.

Mr Johnson said it was ‘huge wasted opportunity’ for those people who are not able to ‘participate’ in the UK economy.

Speaking on LBC radio, he said: ‘I think everybody in London, everybody who comes to work in our economy should be able to speak English.’

In an apparent attack on the last Labour government he went on: ‘We went through a long period in Britain of having kind of multi-culti balkanisation of our society and we thought it was a very good idea to teach kids in their own language in primary school classes in London.

‘I think that’s a disastrous approach, they should be in English.

‘As far as the mayoralty is concerned, we have dropped a lot of those ‘we’ll offer to translate our document into umpteen languages’. I think its complete nonsense.’

He said it was a ‘great shame’ that the last Labour government cut funding for teaching English.

‘We whacked some dosh back in from city hall because I think it’s an absolute priority.’

He said that in many parts of the capital whole communities do not speak English.

‘You go out into Tower Hamlets, places like that, you can find people who have been then there several generations who still don’t speak English.

‘One of the reasons is the media is so massive now but so disparate, so diffuse, that people can be tuned to their own communities and not fell the need to learn the common language of this city, of this country.

‘I think that is a great, great shame, it’s a huge wasted opportunity for them.

‘I think everybody in this country, particularly people working in our public services, should speak English.’

Boris Johnson insisted learning English was easy.

He told LBC: 'It is not a difficult language. The great thing about English is it has so many, very short simple words. 

'Our grammar is unbelievably simple, we have about twice as many words as French or German.

'English is unbelievably easy to get the hang of. Look at the way I can string these sentences together with barely a verb...'

His remarks come after Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggested doctors who cannot speak 'very good English' should be banned from practising in the UK.

The Ukip leader said it was 'scandalous' that not enough doctors and nurses were being trained in Britain, meaning thousands are brought in from overseas.

However, he appeared unaware that two years ago the General Medical Council announced new checks to be carried out on the language skills of medical staff. All NHS doctors have to pass a language test.

Mr Johnson added: ‘I’m amazed by reports that people cannot make themselves understood in English in this country to people working in the NHS. That is completely wrong.

‘I’m sure that the NHS will be taking steps to sort it out. I think that we should have a culture in this country that if you come here, you do as the Romans do and you learn English, you speak English.

‘I don’t mean this by the way in a sort of punitive sense. I’m not saying that everybody should be punished if they fail, this is a wasted opportunity for these companies. They are not able to participate.

‘This is a country where English has been spoken for many centuries.

‘I don’t want to be hostile towards speakers of other languages, other languages are beautiful things, but this is a country that happens to speak English and the way to participate in the London economy, to make a success of your life, my message to everybody whose English is a bit rusty, is go out, find a course for English speakers of another language, they are available.

‘I think that it is completely right that as part of the citizenship test that we have now in British is you should have a pretty good mastery of English.

‘I think everybody should be trying to get up to that standard.’
