A mother who vanished with her four children was arrested today after five days on the run  following a custody battle with their Spanish father.

Jennifer
Jones, 46, had been 'in hiding' with the children, aged between eight and 14, but the children were found today in the Gwent area just after 11am - more than 50 miles away from her home in Llanelli, Wales.

Dyfed Powys Police confirmed this afternoon that Mrs Jones was under arrest for the alleged abduction of her four children.

Jones, 46, has been 'in hiding' with the children, aged between eight 
and 14, (they are pictured but cannot be identified for legal reasons) but were found in the Gwent area just
after 11am this morning

Jones, 45, and her children were discovered in Blackwood, 
Gwent, 30 hours after going on the run.

Dyfed Powys Police arrested Ms Jones and her partner John Williams who are being questioned about the abduction of the children.

A police spokeswoman said: 'A 45-year-old woman has been arrested by 
police in Gwent in connection with the search for four children from 
Llanelli.

'A man who was also arrested is currently being questioned by police to establish his involvement in the matter.'

A spokesman for the force added: 'Police 
and the local authority are now working together with family members to 
ensure the on-going safety of the children.'

Police said the children's father Colonel Tomas Palacin Cambra was 'overjoyed' they had been found. The youngsters cannot be identified or named for legal reasons.

Judge
Mr Justice Roderic Wood, who asked yesterday for the public's help 
finding Miss Jones and the children, is due to analyse developments at a
High Court hearing in London later today.

Spanish
courts granted Colonel Cambra custody of the 
children when his 12 year marriage to Ms Jones ended in 2008.

with her rather than return to their father

Father: Tomas Palacin Cambra (pictured) who Ms Jones' family claim has done 'everything in his power' to stop her seeing the children since their divorce. The couple married in 1996

Her family claim Colonel Cambra has 'done everything in his power' to stop her from seeing the children since their divorce.

Mr Justice Roderic Wood said he was 'concerned' about the children's welfare as a watch was being kept on ports and airports

But they came to stay with Ms Jones at her home in Llanelli, South Wales, in June for a summer holiday and did not return.

All four children started at schools in the town while Ms Jones began legal proceedings in the family court to gain custody.

But the Family Division of the High Court last week ruled the children should be returned to their father by last Friday.

When
Ms Jones failed to return them back to Spain Mr Justice Wood ruled 
the children should be taken from her home by police and social 
services.

But when they arrived in the early hours of Tuesday morning Ms Jones and the four children had packed up and gone.

They were travelling in her car and were believed to have been accompanied by her new partner, named by the court as John Williams.

Ms Jones met Colonel Cambra when he was a young soldier while she was teaching English in Spain.

They were married in 1996 and had a daughter Sara, now 16, who was yesterday in Spain with her father and his family.

They lived in the Canary Islands and Ibiza but frequently returned to Llanelli to stay with Ms Jonesâ€™s family.

The
family were in the process of building a luxury home in Catalonia in 
2008 when Ms Jones and the children returned to Llanelli for 10 months.

Yesterday, Colonel Cambra said: 'All I want is for my children to be returned safely home where they belong.

'I am very worried for their well-being. Their lives are here in Spain, their friends are here, they are very happy here.'

All four children were born in Britain after the couple met in the early 1990s.
