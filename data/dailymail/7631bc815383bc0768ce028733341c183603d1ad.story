It is entirely understandable that when you train so hard for an elusive Olympic gold but fail at one of the final hurdles, you would be upset - perhaps even inconsolable as the life-long dream turns to dust.

But this South Korean athlete may have taken her emotions a little too far after bowing out of the semi-finals of the women's fencing following one of the most controversial moments of the Games so far.

Fencer Shin Lam was in floods of tears at the ExCeL arena after the biggest controversy of the Olympics so far.

Controversy: Shin Lam of South Korea reacts after losing to Britta Heidemann of Germany

The 25-year-old thought she was 
through to the final of the women’s epee when, to her horror and that of
her coach Shim Jaesung, the clock was reset from zero to one second.

And
when the action resumed German Britta Heidemann, gold medallist four 
years ago, scored a do-or-die hit that appeared to have given her a 
place in the final against Ukraine’s Yana Shemyakana.

The Korean coach was incandescent. He furiously launched an appeal against the decision that had allowed the fight to continue and it was nearly half an hour before it was announced to the crowd - slow-handicapping by this stage - that Heidemann’s win stood.

Shin broke down in tears for the second time and while her opponent celebrated she remained on the piste, in what appeared to be a sit-down protest.

The crowd was then told she was doing that because a formal appeal was being considered and if she left the field of play it would be deemed an acceptance of defeat.

By then the bronze medal match should have started, but that faced a lengthy delay - as did the final to follow.

Dream over: Officials lead the fencer away after her appeal

Shin only needed to draw the contest in sudden death because she had been given priority - that is, the onus was on Heidemann to score in the extra minute of sudden death.

The crowd could hardly believe their ears just before 7.40pm - nearly an hour after the incident - when they were told part of the rules was that the Koreans had to lodge money for the appeal to be valid.

Still Shin remained on the piste, 
bringing back memories of compatriot Byun Jong-il’s sit-down strike 
during the boxing in Seoul in 1988.The big difference was that Shin was an innocent in all this and just doing what she was told.

Just before 8pm an official came onto the piste to encourage Shin to leave, but she was unwilling to move.

Another official came on to assist as she crumbles and burst into tears again. The crowd jeered the losing Olympian as she was escorted from the piste, even though the decision had not been announced.

As she was hugged by her coach the announcer asked for respect to be shown to the athletes and judges - and also a big round of applause for the world No 12 as she finally left.

Out of luck: Shin lost the bronze medal match against China's Sun Yujie

The coach left as well, still clearly furious about an outcome that the fans had yet to be told about.

The final should have been staged by then, but the crowd was not able to see what happened next. The spectators had no idea what was going on back stage.

The final decision was that Shin had lost the semi-final and was to compete in the bronze medal match.

Amazingly it began a few minutes later, the Korean coach saying: 'We will try to clam her down, even though she is to be extremely stressed'.

A cult hero of sorts, Shin somehow summoned up the concentration to take an early 4-2 lead over world No 1 Sun Yujie - every hit being roared by her new-found fans.

With the last three-minute period to go it was 9-9, but Shin's agony became complete when Sun took the bronze 15-11 and she was left empty-handed from a night she and the audience will never forget.

This morning BBC fencing commentators complained live on air about technical difficulties.

Not only did they complain they they were too far from the competitors to see the actual fencing, but their monitors were not working. It has been reported that they were having to stream the contest live in order to provide the service.

Not the only one: Gemma Howell was also distraught after she lost her  judo bout through disqualification

Of course Shin won't be the last to show an overt display of emotion when the Olympic dream comes crashing down.

Great Britain's judo competitor Gemma Howell was today disqualified from the women's under-63kg judo round of 32.

Gevrise Emane, of France, proved to be a tough opponent for Team GB's Howell, but she was more than holding her own.

During the latter stages of the bout Howell was adjudged to have illegally grabbed the Frenchwoman's leg which incurred an automatic disqualification.

The Team GB martial artist broke down afterwards, as she saw her Games gold slip through her fingers.
