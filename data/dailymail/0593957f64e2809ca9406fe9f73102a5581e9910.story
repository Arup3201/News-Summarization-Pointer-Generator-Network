The first of 600 U.S. soldiers have arrived in eastern Europe as a Pentagon spokesman declared the mission was sending a 'message to Moscow'.

But the Nato drills prompted a backlash from Russia, which sent its troops on exercises along the Ukrainian border today and declared: 'We have to react somehow'.

The escalation of east-west tensions comes amid a slowly rising death toll in Ukraine, where the government renewed its crackdown today on pro-Russian militants leaving at least five shot dead.

Drills: 150 U.S. troops have arrived at an air force base in Swidwin, Poland, prompting a Kremlin backlash

Marching out: There will be 600 U.S. Nato troops spread between Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania

Around 150 soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade arrived yesterday at an air force base in Swidwin, western Poland, as the U.S. stepped up its presence in eastern Europe.

Flying to the region from their previous posting in Italy, they were met by Polish troops in similar red berets and the nation's defence minister.

Within a few days there will be 450 more American Nato troops spread between Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

The Americans insisted the military exercises will not be a precursor to intervention in Ukraine, which is not a Nato member, and they could last until next year.

But Rear Admiral John Kirby, a top Defense
 Department spokesman, said the deployments sent a strong message to Nato allies about U.S. commitments to the alliance following events in 
Ukraine.

'If there's a 
message to Moscow, it is the same exact message that we take our 
obligations very, very seriously on the continent of Europe,' he added.

But Russia has insisted the build-up may violate the Founding Act, a 1997 agreement between 
Moscow and Nato.

Today Russian Defense 
Minister Sergei Shoigu reacted by ordering new military exercises in Russia's 
south and west, along the Ukrainian border.

The latest exercises - which add to the tens of thousands of troops already massed on the border - will involve 
ground and air forces.

'We have to react to these developments somehow,' he said.

Mr Shoigu quoted unspecified sources claiming Kiev has deployed more than
 11,000 troops and 160 tanks against just 2,000 pro-Russian insurgents.

Today Russian President Vladimir Putin added: 'If the Kiev government is using the army against its own people this is clearly a grave crime.'

The U.S. and Nato have insisted their troops will not intervene in Ukraine despite Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and a 
buildup of Russian forces on the border.

But they are 'temporarily' boosting their presence in eastern 
Europe in a drive to reassure allies that they would have protection against any Russian aggression.

Reactions: Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said the deployments, praised by Poland, Estonia and Latvia, would 'strengthen our readiness for collective defence and will add to ensuring safety of our people'

Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all have their own Russian-speaking 
minorities and governments there are worries the crisis in Ukraine could spread.

The 
Latvian government welcomed the move, calling it a 'fast and 
practical response.'

Estonian Defence Minister Sven Mikser added it 'significantly increases the security of Estonia.'

And Lithuanian President Dalia 
Grybauskaite said the deployments would 'strengthen our readiness for 
collective defence and will add to ensuring safety of our people.'

Poland, which only emerged from 
Soviet-imposed communism in 1989, has also called for a strong presence of western troops.

The exercises run in month-long rounds in what the Pentagon calls a 'persistent rotational 
presence' that stops short of permanently basing troops in the Baltic states.

The American frigate USS Taylor has also returned to the Black Sea, just as the guided-missile destroyer USS Donald Cook prepares to leave in the next few days.
