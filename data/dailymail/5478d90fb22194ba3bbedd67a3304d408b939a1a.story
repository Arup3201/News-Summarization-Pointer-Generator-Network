Millions of pounds in bonuses are expected to be handed out to top bankers at Barclays this week as part of performance-related pay deals agreed up to two years ago.

In a move which could spark fresh controversy over City pay, Barclays is thought to be preparing to release millions of pounds of shares to its highest-ranking staff.

It comes just a week after the bank was forced to admit two of its schemes, designed to avoid £500million in tax, were shut down by HM Revenue and Customs.

The Guardian reported that those in line for a pay deal include Jerry del Missier and Rich Ricci, who run the Barclays capital Investment bank, as well as Robert Le Blanc, head of risk, Antony Jenkins, head of the retail bank, and Tom Kalaris, head of wealth management.

They stand to receive up to £7.5million from pay deals that were agreed in 2010, according to disclosures made to the stock exchange.

Last year the five became the highest-paid Barclays executives when they shared in a £110million payout, which came from when deals from previous years paid out.

Last week, Barclays was prevented from using two ‘highly abusive’  loopholes to dodge paying £500million of tax.

The British banking giant - which recently signed a pledge not to engage in tax avoidance - was ordered to cough up the cash by the Government.

Barclays, which last month unveiled £6billion of profits, has faced questions for years about the amount of tax it pays.

The bank is also disputing the amount of tax it should pay, saying the real figure should be £200m.

The Government has now outlawed both loopholes. This is expected to earn it a further £2billion in tax in future years that would otherwise have gone unpaid.
