A two-year-old Florida girl died earlier this week after she tumbled out of a minivan and was accidentally run over by her great-grandmother. 

Izbella Bronson was riding in the back of Alice Barber's 2008 Kia Sedona with the door open on Wednesday afternoon in Palm City when she fell out. 

Barber, 69, had just picked Izbella' brothers - aged nine and seven - up at the bus stop and was driving the van back up her private driveway.

The little girl was run over by one of the van's rear tires and she died later at Tampa General Hospital 

No charges are pending because the accident occurred on a private driveway and car seat rules don't apply

The seven-year-old brother was running ahead to the house while Izbella and her other brother sat on the floor of the van with the door open. 

The little girl fell out just before the van made it back to the house, Bay News 9 reported. 

She was run over by the van and died after being taken to Tampa General Hospital. 

Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Larry McKinnon said: 'Unfortunately, this time on the way back, she obviously hit something that knocked the child out and underneath the rear wheels.'

There are no charges pending because the accident occurred on a private driveway where car seat rules don't apply, ABC Action News reported. 

McKinnon said: 'These are potential risks that you take when you put a child that is not secured in a car seat regardless of where it's at.

'So it's a lesson learned, a tragic lesson learned.'
