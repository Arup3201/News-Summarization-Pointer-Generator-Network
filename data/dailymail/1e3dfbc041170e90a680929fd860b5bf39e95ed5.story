He once said his recipe for perfect happiness was a good book and a good bottle of wine.

But Johnny Depp – who famously sports a ‘wino forever’ tattoo on his arm – has turned teetotal for his latest movie role.

Depp, 48, has given up alcohol to play Tonto in a remake of the hit TV series The Lone Ranger – and has told how a painting inspired his dramatic on-screen look.

The star is a practitioner of ‘method acting’ which involves remaining in character even when the cameras have stopped rolling.

Depp, who is filming the £100 million Western in New Mexico, stopped drinking because loyal sidekick Tonto is a teetotaller.

A source said: ‘Johnny remains in character on set. The only time he breaks character is to talk to Vanessa [Paradis, his long-term partner] and their kids.

‘Tonto doesn’t drink, so Johnny hasn’t been drinking.’

Depp appears in black-and-white make-up with a black crow on his head for his latest role.

He took inspiration for the look from the painting by Kirby Sattler entitled I Am Crow.

Role play: Depp is a practitioner of 'method acting'

Depp said: ‘I looked at that painting and thought, “That’s it.” The stripes down the face and across the eyes . . . you could almost see the separate sections of the individual.

‘There’s this very wise quarter, a very tortured and hurt section, an angry and rageful section and a very understanding and unique side. I saw those parts, almost like dissecting a brain, these slivers of the individual.’

Depp added: ‘I have some native American in me. My great-grandmother was quite a bit of native American. She grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian.’

It isn’t the first time Depp has been inspired by art. He based his Pirates Of The Caribbean character, Captain Jack Sparrow, on a painting of rock legend Keith Richards dressed as a pirate.

The source added: ‘Johnny’s Tonto is far removed from the classic TV version of the character.

This Lone Ranger is much darker and tells the story of the expansion of the railroad across the American West from the point of view of the American Indians who were kicked off their reservations.’

Rising Hollywood actor Armie Hammer, who played the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network, stars as the Lone Ranger, with British actors Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Wilkinson among the cast.

The source said: ‘The film is told through Tonto’s eyes and shows the injustices handed out to native Indians. Johnny’s Tonto is no mere sidekick. He’s the driving force of the film.’
