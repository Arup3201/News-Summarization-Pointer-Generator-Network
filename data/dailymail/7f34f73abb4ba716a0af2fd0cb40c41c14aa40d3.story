Tournament officials had warned the crowd to take cover from the heat on the day, while players were given ice water and longer breaks between sets.

A heatwave plagued the event, with ball boys, players and spectators all collapsing under the heat.

The heat, which passed 40 degrees on some days, even caused tram tracks to buckle, forcing spectators to walk under the scorching sunlight.

No extreme heat is forecasted for next week, since a moist air mass from the east will prevent any heat from interior reaching Melbourne for an extended time period.
