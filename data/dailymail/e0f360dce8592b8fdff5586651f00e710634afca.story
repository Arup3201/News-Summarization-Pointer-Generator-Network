Charged: William Bradley, 46, was arrested yesterday and charged with various drug crimes following six-month investigation

A 46-year-old man claiming to have terminal cancer has been busted on drug charges after posting a video of himself walking through his towering marijuana crop.

Police nabbed Connecticut's William Bradley yesterday after spotting the YouTube clip called 'Hope Garden' when it was posted in October.

In the seven-minute video, Bradley welcomed people to his 'garden' and said he was growing pot because he had cancer.

He also begged for donations because he wanted to give away the buds to people who needed them for medical reasons.

During the rambling clip, Bradley explained his predicament and occasionally stopped to smell the plants.

'This bouquet of flowers is for everyone. I want everyone to see how beautiful they are,' he said, inhaling the crop.

'They smell so nice. They'll be harvesting in about two weeks.

'As you can see, God has 
gifted me with an abundance and itâ€™s more than I need. I want to be able to help people like myself and I 
donâ€™t have the money to do that.'

Bradley also offered his full name and postal address in the video for potential donors - leading police directly to him. 

However, the Clinton resident insisted he had done nothing wrong.

Desperate: William Bradley claims in the video that he has terminal cancer and needs help giving away extra marijuana growing in his 'Hope Garden'

The yield: 'God has gifted me with an abundance and it's more than I need, so I want to take the extra and give it to people that need the help,' Bradley said on the video about his bountiful marijuana crop

He said he was motivated by a need to help others who were suffering from similar illnesses and, like him, weren't enrolled in the state's medical marijuana program.

'I want legalization for people with terminal illnesses,' he told New York Daily News.

'It's a sin. It's only an herbal remedy, it's not a narcotic.

'(I made the video) so I could live more comfortably. It shows my desperation.'

The disability benefits recipient said his doctors refused to prescribe medication for his treatment, particularly after he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident.

'I'm a marcher,' he said. 'I will not stop fighting, because I know in my heart of hearts I'm right.'

Police said they seized two pounds of weed, 20 grams of hashish, two bags of cocaine, $1,000 in cash and drug paraphernalia from a storage unit Bradley used near his home.

Bradley
 was charged with possession of narcotics with intent to sell, 
possession of drug paraphernalia and operating a drug factory.

He was released on $5,000 bond after he was arraigned.

Bradley reportedly has a history of possessing and selling drugs.

The Hartford Courant reported
 he was arrested in 2008 for operating a drug factory.

Police found more
 than 10 pounds of pot, hashish and mushrooms during a raid at his home.
