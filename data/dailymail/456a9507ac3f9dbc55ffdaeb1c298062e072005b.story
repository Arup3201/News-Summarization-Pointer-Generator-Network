The former child actress, who exposed her Hey Dad! co-star Robert Hughes of his child sex abuse, is moving on from her home in Texas, USA after urging other victims to come forward against celebrity perpetrators of sex crimes.

Sarah Monahan put the San Antonio house she shares with her American husband, Matt Morris, on the market almost a month after Hughes was jailed for at least six years for 10 child sex offences.

And last week, she urged other abuse victims to come forward against celebrity perpetrators of sex crimes, in the wake of Rolf Harris being found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK.

The brave ex-actress first spoke out about Hughes in March 2010, when in an interview with Woman's Day magazine she revealed that she was sexually abused on the set of Hey Dad! sometime between 1987 to 1994.

Ms Monahan played schoolgirl Jenny Kelly on the sitcom from the age six.

Moving on: Sarah Monahan spoke out about actor Robert Hughes who abused her on the set of Hey Dad!

Convicted: Rolf Harris (left) has been found guilty of of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK. Robert Hughes (right) was sentenced on May 16 to a maximum 10 years nine months with a non parole period of six years for the child sex offences he committed between 1983 and 1991

The Australian, now 37, is advertising the property on her website.

'It's been a wonderful home for us. I've actually lived there longer than any other house,' she wrote.

'We threw amazing parties there, it's perfect for entertaining. We're sad to leave such a beautiful home, but we know someone else will enjoy it as much as we did,' Ms Monahan, who was born in Sydney and met her husband in Brisbane, added.

Hughes, 65, was sentenced on May 16 to a maximum 10 years nine months with a non parole period of six years for the child sex offences he committed between 1983 and 1991.

Speaking out last week after Harris was found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK, she said: 'I know there's several people in Australia who are wondering whether to speak up about others in the industry. You don't have to go public like I did, but please go to the police.'

Predator on the set: Judge Peter Zahra said Robert Hughes wandered naked among Hey Dad cast members (above) and that he placed his hand on the bottom of child star Sarah Monahan (right), exposed his penis to her and after one episode grabbed and touched her intimately while pretending to tickle her

'Let's keep speaking up about these unspeakable acts. Let's teach these predators that they are no longer untouchable.

'When I went public four years ago, it was still taboo to point the finger at a celebrity for having committed a sex crime,' she said.

Describing the house which she hopes to sell now that she and her husband have relocated to be closer to her job, she said: 'The house is in the city of Windcrest. It has it's own police and fire departments, with an average response time of 90 seconds. – yep, we know from experience.'

Ms Monahan and her husband are making a fresh start away from their 2,400 square foot house in a much smaller home after she became 'fascinated with the tiny house' movement, which advocates living simply in small homes.

'It's been a wonderful home for us': Writing about the house she is leaving behind, Ms Monahan said she ensured it had an Australian element with a salt water pool

The tiny house movement is a return to houses less than 1,000 square feet, and Monahan has bought one with wheels - similar to an RV - which is built to last as long as traditional homes.

Writing about the house she is leaving behind, she said she had ensured it had an Australian element to it despite being located in Texas, USA.

'We changed the pool equipment and now have a salt water pool. I really missed salt water pools from Australia, so Matt upgraded for me. It’s 12,000 gallons of backyard bliss,' she said.

When Hughes was sentenced before a packed gallery at the Sydney District Court, Judge Peter Zahra said he had not expressed remorse.

'His conduct continued over 20 years. [Even] after he was questioned by police in 1986 it continued,' he said.

'The offender took advantage of when he was with victims in social settings in his home or at victims' homes.

'He lacks insight into his offending and he is unlikely to access treatment programs.'

Ms Monahan reacted to the news by saying she is 'happy' and that she hopes Hughes now 'realises he's a bad man'

Judge Zahra said he had considered the 'substantial effect' of Hughes conduct on his victims who now suffered from constant fear, eating disorders and who lacked the ability to lead normal lives.
