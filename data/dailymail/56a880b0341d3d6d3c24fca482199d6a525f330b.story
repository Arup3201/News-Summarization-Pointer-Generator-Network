Caught: Victoria Earle, from South Shields, South Tyneside has received a suspended prison sentence at Newcastle Crown Court despite stealing over £30,000 from vulnerable customers

A banker who stole more than £30,000 from sick and elderly customers has walked free after a judge decided her dishonesty was a ‘cry for help’.

Victoria Earle targeted the accounts of four vulnerable customers at her branch of the Lloyds TSB bank.

Three of the personal banker’s victims had Alzheimer’s disease and one was blind and deaf. One of the customers was nearly 70 and the rest were in their 80s.

But the court heard she was getting over the loss of a grandparent and was finding her work stressful.

The judge, Mr Recorder Edward Bindloss, said a suspended jail sentence and the loss of her good name was adequate punishment.

Newcastle Crown Court heard the 40-year-old mother of two, who had worked at the bank for more than 20 years, would make withdrawals from the accounts using her ID card and process the transaction as if the customer was actually there at the bank in South Shields. She would then simply pocket the cash.

Earle was caught after one of the customers noticed a withdrawal she could not remember making and a data trawl at the bank revealed what had been going on.

Prosecutor Mark Guiliani said: ‘The bank checked CCTV and when the transactions were being made the customer was not there.’Earle confessed to detectives what she had done and admitted she had targeted those who were forgetful and who were unlikely to realise that they were being duped.

Mr Guiliani said: ‘She targeted vulnerable and elderly victims and exploited her position to draw money from their accounts.

‘She calls it a failure in the system she was exploiting. The actual situation is she was exploiting her position as an employee and breaching the bank’s trust in her. It was not a weakness in the system.’

Earle, from South Shields, South Tyneside, admitted six charges of fraud over two years between 2011 and 2013.

Judge Bindloss told her: ‘I am satisfied you targeted those customers because of their vulnerability, knowing the money taken would not be noticed by them.’

But he said he took into account the fact Earle was suffering from depression after the loss of a grandparent, pressure at work starting to mount, communication problems with her husband and financial worries.

He added: ‘Notwithstanding the targeting, there was here, in some bizarre way, a cry for help.’ The judge suspended Earle’s12-month jail term for 12 months, with supervision, and said the loss of the ‘high achiever’s’ good name would be a significant punishment.

He added: ‘You knew the day would come when you would be caught.’

Brian Hegarty, defending, said Earle 
struggled when she was promoted to personal banker, which required her 
to be a ‘pushy sales person’ with targets to meet.

Mr Hegarty said that his client has signed a declaration which will allow the £31,997 she stole to be taken out of her pension and paid back to the bank. Lloyds TSB has already reimbursed the customers.

Under the 2006 Fraud Act, the maximum sentence for cases of fraud heard at a crown court is ten years in jail. Fraudsters who target vulnerable victims such as the elderly will face tougher penalties in future under sentencing guidelines unveiled last week.
