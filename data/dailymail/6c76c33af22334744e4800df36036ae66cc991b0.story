Paul Ross feared for his life after collapsing in a car park after taking a massive hit of the drug mephedrone.

The married BBC presenter yesterday confessed to a gay affair with a man he met at a dogging spot and became hooked on the drug - also known as meow meow - which he snorted off the man's face.

The 57-year-old, who is the older brother of chat show host Jonathan Ross and a father-of-five, has admitted to cheating on his wife of 10 years with former English teacher Barry Olivier.

The collapse came after his wife Jackie traced his phone to Mr Olivier's flat in Maidenhead, Berkshire.

Ross, who had done six lines of the drug, ignored his wife's repeated bell ringing. He then took a 'huge bolt' of mephedrone and drove to a hotel in High Wycombe.

The  BBC Radio London presenter told The Sun: 'I genuinely thought I was going to die.

'I parked in the car park near a hotel and just collapsed on the tarmac. It was daylight but no one was around to help.'

The former film critic said the episode gave him a new-found clarity and he vowed to ditch the drug and make his marriage work.

Despite the affair, Jackie, who married the presenter in 2004,  is sticking by him, saying she is not ending a 14 year relationship over a 'six months of madness'.

Mephedrone, or meow meow, is a powerful stimulant and is part of a group of drugs that are closely related to the amphetamines, like speed and ecstasy.

There isn't much evidence about mephedrone and it's long term effects as it's quite a new drug but because it is similar to speed and ecstasy the

long-term effects may well be similar. There have reports of people hospitalised due to the short-term effects.

It can cause euphoria, alertness and feelings of affection towards the people around you, but also anxiety and paranoia.

Mephedrone, or meow meow, can also overstimulate the heart and circulation; and can overstimulate the nervous system, with risk of fits.

Mephedrone is a Class B drug and possession can result in up to five years in jail and/or an unlimited fine. 

Ross said he was looking for an escape after facing financial ruin, which led him to look for casual sex on the Internet.

After visiting a dogging site near to the Thicket roundabout in Maidenhead, he then met Mr Olivier, a father-of-four and began an affair, with them regularly meeting up at his flat in the Berkshire town  to take the drug.

Mr Olivier claims that the presenter, with whom he used the pet names Puck and Pea, would often drive to his flat to snort mephedrone and have sex before starting his radio show.

However, Ross has strongly denied taking drugs before presenting the show.

The star then confessed to his wife about his drug use but it was only ten days ago that Mr Olivier got in touch to reveal the full extent of the affair. 

He has two divorces behind him and five children by his two former wives. 

In 2011, he spoke about selling his 600-year-old timber-framed property in the village of Bisham, near Marlow, Buckinghamshire, for £579,950

He said at the time: 'We're under no pressure to sell – the next house will probably be our last move so it's got to be right.

'We no longer need so many bedrooms as the girls don't tend to stay all at once any more,' said the presenter, who grew up in Leytonstone, east London, with his five younger siblings, who all work in the media.

The BBC  announced that Ross will not be presenting his show this morning to 'deal with his issues' and is expected to be off air most of the month.

A spokesman for the BBC said: 'Paul has spoken about his personal problems at length. He will be taking some time off to deal with those issues and won't be on air on Monday.'

The financial fortunes of Ross, have been rather more mixed than his younger brother, chat show host Jonathan
