The fate of the United Kingdom is in the balance, with tomorrow’s Scottish independence referendum still on a knife-edge, an exclusive poll reveals.

With only 24 hours to go in the increasingly rancorous campaign, the No side has a four-point lead – on 52 per cent compared with 48 per cent for Yes.

But the Survation survey for the Daily Mail suggests that the separatists are closing the gap – and that the outcome now depends on around 350,000 voters who have still to make up their minds.

It also indicates that Labour is again haemorrhaging support to Yes, with a third of those who voted for the party in the 2011 Scottish elections intending to back independence. 

The three pro-Union parties were yesterday engaged in a last-minute whirlwind of campaign visits as they seek to shore up the No vote.

Writing in today’s Scottish Daily Mail, Better Together leader Alistair Darling warns: ‘I’m not exaggerating when I say Thursday is probably the most important day of our democratic lives.

‘From 7am until 10pm, Scotland and the UK will be in limbo, and everything which we have built over these last three centuries will hang in the balance.’

David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg yesterday signed a ‘vow’ to hand Edinburgh more powers if the Scots choose to stay – and promised to preserve the controversial funding formula which guarantees Scotland more public cash.

The No campaign also seized on leaked documents suggesting the SNP would have to cut hundreds of millions of pounds from the NHS budget after the referendum. The Yes campaign described Westminster leaders’ last-ditch commitment as an ‘insult’ and asked why it was being made at such a late stage.

Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond will today issue an appeal to voters not to be swayed by the ‘increasingly desperate and absurd scare stories being generated daily from Downing Street’.

He will describe tomorrow’s referendum as ‘the greatest empowering moment any of us will ever have’.

Today’s Survation poll is one of the final tests of public opinion before polling stations open. Voters were canvassed online between September 12 and yesterday morning.

The headline results show that 44.1 per cent of Scots plan to back independence, up from 42.4 per cent in a comparable poll from last week. 

Support for a No vote remains virtually static at 47.7 per cent, with 8.3 per cent undecided. Overall, this points to a final result of 52 per cent No and 48 per cent Yes. 

The poll confirms a gender divide across Scotland, with 49 per cent of men planning to vote Yes and 46 per cent saying No. Just 39 per cent of women plan to vote Yes, with 49 per cent choosing No.

Alarmingly for the No camp, the poll indicates a shift back to Yes among Labour voters, who may decide the outcome. While 91 per cent of those who voted Conservative in the 2011 Holyrood elections are backing No, just 60 per cent of Labour voters plan to do the same.

Damian Lyons Lowe, chief executive of Survation, said: ‘In terms of the race itself, with 8 per cent of the electorate still undecided, there is still everything to fight for and this poll should leave no room for complacency for the Better Together campaign.

An online bookmaker is so confident of a win for the No camp it has already started paying out to those who staked money on it. Betfair said it was paying out a ‘six-figure sum’ despite the polls narrowing. It said gambling patterns indicate a 79 per cent likelihood of a No vote.
