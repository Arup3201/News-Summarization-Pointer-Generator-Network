The first breakthrough drug for pancreatic cancer in 20 years will not be available on the NHS.

Hundreds of patients with advanced disease will be denied Abraxane, which extends life by two months when there are virtually no other options.

Campaigners said draft guidance by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), the rationing watchdog for England, that the drug was not cost effective would leave patients in despair.

Ali Stunt, founder and CEO of the charity Pancreatic Cancer Action, said ‘We are outraged by the decision.

‘This is the first time Nice has looked at an effective treatment for the disease since 2001 and they have rejected it.

‘There is a real disparity between survival rates here, which have been unchanged for 40 years, and elsewhere in Europe where patients survive twice as long and this decision is a backward step.’

About 8,500 Britons are diagnosed annually with pancreatic cancer, which kills four in five sufferers within a year.

Tumours are hard to detect because the pancreas is buried deep in the body so symptoms emerge when the disease is at an advanced stage.

Pancreatic cancer claimed the lives of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and author Iain Banks, and was the disease which triggered the character Hayley Cropper in TV’s Coronation Street to kill herself.

The drug is given as an intravenous injection costing £600 a week, with an average course of treatment costing £5,000.

Trial data shows that Abraxane and chemotherapy increases average survival by two months, but also increases the number of patients alive after two years.

Professor Will Steward, Professor of Medical Oncology in Leicester, said ‘This is very depressing news for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who already have very limited treatment options.

‘This negative Nice decision means that hundreds of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, who could potentially benefit from Abraxane, will not have access to it.

‘For a cancer which has such poor survival rates, this is a very sad decision by Nice and now leaves clinicians with limited treatment options.’

Abraxane is currently available through the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) in England, but could be axed as part of a cost-cutting review.

Over 260 advanced pancreatic cancer patients have received it via the CDF since March.

Mother of five Sandra Hukin, 54, who lives near Bedford with partner Roy, 50, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the end of August, after a short period of stomach symptoms.

Within a couple of weeks she was in excruciating pain and warned the cancer had spread to several sites in her body.

She went on to Abraxane after her consultant at Bedford Hospital applied for funding and has felt well since.

Ms Hukin, who was a nurse specialising in learning disability patients, says the drug meant she could enjoy Christmas with her family.

‘I’d been as fit as a fiddle until this summer, I’ve never had any call on the NHS until now and there is nothing else for someone like me.

‘It’s too distressing to imagine others will have to go without’ she added.

London-based oncologist Dr Andrew Gaya said This is very disappointing news for both clinicians and patients.

‘A two month survival benefit in pancreatic cancer is actually extremely significant given the average survival for metastatic patients of 6 - 8 months.

‘If this negative review is upheld it would be a backwards step for pancreas cancer patients in England.’

Ms Alex Ford, Chief Executive of Pancreatic Cancer UK charity, called on Nice to reconsider.

She said ‘The Nice decision and the review by the CDF which could lead to Abraxane being removed from the CDF, is devastating news for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who currently have very few treatment options.’

Dr Adrian Kilcoyne, Medical Director, Celgene UK & Ireland which makes the drug, said ‘This decision is a serious setback for both clinicians and patients.’

Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE chief executive, said Abraxane was more effective than one of the treatment options currently available, but was also more expensive.
