A toddler who hit puberty ten years early has been cured by brain surgery.

The three-year-old's condition made meant his voice deepened, genitals grew and skin was covered with acne.

He also became outlandishly aggressive.

It started when he was just 18 months old.

Cured: The boy was treated with deep skull brain surgery at Jimper medical centre in Puducherry, India

When his nervous parents took him to the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Puducherry, medics discovered the child had 'precocious puberty'.

At first he was put on a programme of regular injections to control the hormones.

But after two years, his parents were struggling to afford the specialist treatment, which was set to continue for ten years but was having little effect.

Desperate for another solution, they agreed to try skull base surgery to remove abnormal tissue in the area of the nervous system where hormones are produced.

Dr V. R. Roopesh Kumar, head of neurosurgery at Jipmer, told the Times of India: 'Precocious puberty can be completely cured by appropriate medical or surgical intervention if diagnosed early.

'Children with this condition attain puberty before eight years of age.

Rare: The parents from Puducherry paid for injections for two years but it was expensive with little to no effect

'The patient responded well. It is a complex surgery as the abnormal tissue had to be removed without damaging the vital neurovascular structures surrounding it.

'His hormone values became normal for his age and he does not require any further treatment.'

The condition, which produces an abnormal amount of sex hormones like oestrogen before the age of 10, is often caused by brain damage.

It affects one in every 5,000 to 10,000 children in America but rarely affects somebody so young. Usually girls develop the disorder aged 9; boys aged 10.

More commonly found in girls, the youngest parent in history was five-year-old Lina Medina, who gave birth in Peru in 1939.
