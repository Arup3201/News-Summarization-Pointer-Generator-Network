A mother has spoken of the heartbreaking moment her beloved golden Labrador died in her arms after she was poisoned - just hours before another family dog suffered the same cruel fate.

Ali Harling, 45, from Preesall, Lancashire, was left 'devastated' after someone deliberately threw a drug over her garden fence, killing two of her pets.

Her 11-year-old golden Labrador Dizzy died in the car on the way to the vets, before her other dog Stan, who was four, passed away.

Tragic: Dizzy, pictured asleep right, died in Mrs Harling's arms as they travelled to the vet

Mrs Harling, said: 'I am devastated. They were my babies. 'They were completely innocent, they never did anything wrong. What happened was completely mindless.'

Mrs Harling said when vets started operating on Stan, also a golden Labrador, they found his intestines were 'shredded' as a result of eating the over-the-counter drug, which police are not naming for fear of it being used to harm animals.

Stan’s liver and kidneys were also failing. Mrs Harling’s other dogs, golden Labrador Jake, 13, and nine-month-old dachshund Alfie, were taken ill at their home, but are recovering well.

Mrs Harling said she believed the drug had been thrown over her gate on June 15 or in the early hours of June 16.

She said all her dogs suddenly got very sick at the same time. She kept an eye on them, and throughout the day they appeared better but, by the following morning - June 17, Dizzy and Stan were so poorly she rushed them to the vets.

She said: 'On the way, Dizzy took two 
massive breaths, and then she was gone. After they’d tried operating on 
Stan, the vet told us to call the police as the dogs had symptoms of 
poisoning.'

Mrs Harling said
 it was difficult to control what the dogs ate while out of sight, and 
when they became ill it was normal practice to hydrate them and keep 
them off food until they are better.

'You
 can’t go to the vets every time they are sick,' she said. 'Dogs are 
scavengers and they eat anything, but I know they didn’t get this drug 
from my home.

'Someone has done this on purpose in a calculated attack. Police are keen to hear from anyone with information on the attack.

PC
 Dave Kerfoot, of Garstang and Over Wyre police, said: 'This is clearly a
 very distressing incident and one that we are taking very seriously.'
