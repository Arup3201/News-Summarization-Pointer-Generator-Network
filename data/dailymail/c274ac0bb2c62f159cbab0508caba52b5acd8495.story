Legendary music producer Quincy Jones is suing Michael Jackson's estate, claiming he is owed millions in royalties and production fees on some of the late superstar's greatest hits that were re-released after Jackson's death.

The lawsuit, which was filed on Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks at least $10 million from the singer's estate and Sony Music Entertainment, claiming the entities improperly re-edited songs to deprive Jones of royalties and production fees.

The music has been used in the film 'This Is It' and a pair of Cirque du Soleil shows based on the King of Pop's songs, the lawsuit states.

Jones also claims that he should have received a producer's credit on the music in 'This Is It'.

His lawsuit seeks an accounting of the estate's profits from the works so that Jones can determine how much he is owed.

The producer worked with Jackson on three of his most popular solo albums, 'Off the Wall', 'Thriller' and 'Bad'.

'Quincy has been frustrated with these matters for a number of years, felt he was not making any progress and needed to take more formal action,' says Henry Gradstein, his attorney.

Jackson's estate wrote in a statement that it was saddened by Jones' lawsuit.

'To the best of its knowledge, Mr. Jones has been appropriately compensated over approximately 35 years for his work with Michael,' the statement said.

An after-hours message left at Sony Music's New York offices was not immediately returned.

Jackson's hits 'Billie Jean', 'Thriller' and 'Don't Stop `Til You Get Enough' are among the songs Jones claims were re-edited to deprive him of royalties and his producer's fee.

Jones' lawsuit states the producer's contracts called for him to have the first opportunity to re-edit or alter the songs, in part to protect his reputation.

Following Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, the superstar had a resurgence of popularity, causing the executors of his estate and those who had control over his work to try and find ways to release new works.

In October that year, 'This Is It', a documentary from AEG Live and The Michael Jackson Company, was released, centering on behind-the-scenes footage of Jackson preparing for what would have been his final concert tour.

Two years later Cirque du Soleil launched a traveling theater show called 'Michael Jackson: The Immortal Tour', which has so far grossed an estimated $300 million.

In May, Cirque du Soleil premiered a new production called 'Michael Jackson: One'.

The 'This Is It' soundtrack included re-edits of 'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough', 'She's Out Of My Life', 'Thriller', 'Beat It', 'Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' and 'Billy Jean'.

The Cirque du Soleil production and album includes re-edits of many of those songs as well as 'Burn The Disco Out', 'Workin' Day And Night', 'Baby Be Mine' and others.

Jones claims the terms of his deal were breached when third parties were allowed to exploit these works 'without first providing a reasonable opportunity to Jones to perform such remixes and/or re-edits'.

Then the complaint refers to 'clandestine agreements' allegedly made to reduce Jones' royalties.
