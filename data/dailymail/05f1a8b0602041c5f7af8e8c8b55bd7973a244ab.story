Wealthy families from the Middle East are buying up London's luxury homes in the wake of the area's instability and now make up a tenth of all buyers in the exclusive Mayfair area.

In recent years, Middle Eastern governments and sovereign funds have ploughed their vast resources into the capital, buying development sites and high-value buildings, according to research by a Mayfair property firm.

They have spent  £4.4billion since 2006 and now control nine of central London's largest development sites, equating to 28,000 new homes.

The super-rich have also bought prime residential properties in Knightsbridge, Mayfair, Kensington, Belgravia and Regent's Park - so much so that half of all buyers of Mayfair property worth more than £10million are from the Gulf.

Property firm Wetherell Estates surveyed all property sales last year in Mayfair and said a tenth of all homes were bought by Gulf investors - rising to 50 per cent for those worth more than £10million.

The Abu Dhabi Royal family, the Al Nahyans, are now the largest landowner in Mayfair after the Duke of Westminster.

Their portfolio includes the £400million Berkeley Square Estate, purchased in 2001, which consists of the square and surrounding buildings.

Abu Dhabi is also funding the £200million conversion of the former U.S. Naval Headquarters in Grosvenor Square which will be redeveloped into luxury apartments and penthouses.

The State of Qatar is another massive investor in Mayfair with the Al-Thani family buying a £200million mansion on Park Lane in 2006.

The Deputy Prime Minister of Qatar owns the £180million Lombard House mansion on Curzon Street whilst state backed funds bought the £500 million American Embassy which is to be converted into a luxury hotel.

Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'Every time there has been economic or political upheaval in the Middle East, it has generated a new wave of Middle East purchasers and investors into Mayfair and the wider West End.

'Prime Central London is viewed as an island of stability, with Mayfair the top location due to its role as the base for many Gulf region embassies and other diplomatic quarters.'

The influx of oil-based wealth began in the early 1970s when the Saudis started to buy property in and around Mayfair.

The fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979 was a wake up call to the other Gulf monarchies that they needed an international portfolio of homes to provide security and overseas assets.

And during the first Gulf War (1990 to 1991), there was an an influx of Kuwait and Saudi investment into the London property market.

Mr Wetherell added: 'The biggest change in the last few years has been the shift in wealthy Middle East residents choosing to live in London for large amounts of the year, rather than just in the Summer months.

'Since the upheavals of the 'Arab Spring' many Gulf leaders and business people now come to London far more frequently for business and socialising.

'They also choose to base family members - grandparents, aunts and uncles and student offspring - in London for long periods for safety, education and shopping.'
