So this is Christmas. And what have you done? In the case of FIFA, and its damnable task force, they have done as expected. They have come up with a compromise that isn’t and a solution that was never going to be.

Everyone knew how this was going to pan out, but seeing the news in black and white makes it suddenly real.

Not just for fans, or armchair followers, but those who run football clubs, particularly those living from hand to mouth.

It is not just the elite programme of fixtures that has been surrendered to accommodate the World Cup in Qatar. Football League clubs will have to plan without the Christmas and New Year schedule in 2022, too. Revenue streams will be disrupted, payment plans reorganised.

You know the way your mortgage comes out after payday? It works like that in football, too. Clubs settle debts at times conducive to revenue. The holiday period is a good earner and comes just before the transfer window.

Not so perilous at Manchester United but potentially disastrous at Hartlepool United. Not that too many on a big, important FIFA task force will be thinking about them.

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore is among those on the World Cup task force

The task force, though, are picking up the pieces for the real culprits. Greg Dyke, the chairman of the Football Association, had it right. ‘We would not be doing this if FIFA had done their work properly,’ he said. ‘This is something FIFA brought on itself by not reading the report of the safety inspector. It tells you the technical assessment was not being used as the basis for the decision.’

Tuesday’s news goes to the very heart of FIFA corruption.

This would not be necessary if the World Cup had not been awarded to Qatar; and the World Cup would not have been awarded to Qatar if — well, who knows why the World Cup was awarded to Qatar?

Who knows why it is still there, considering recent revelations have linked the bid, and the hosts, to bribery and slave labour and established connections to some of the vilest men on the planet?

Who knows why it was ever there when FIFA’s technical inspection team may as well have stamped DANGER in big red letters across Qatar’s bid, due to the extreme summer heat?

The idea that the November-December World Cup is the least worst solution only works if we abandon the idea of starting again. This is what should have happened the moment the World Cup FIFA voted for — taking place in a desert in 50 degrees — was deemed unworkable and treacherous.

The tournament that replaces it is one that was never discussed and ruins domestic competitions that have been running for longer than FIFA’s jamboree, and with greater integrity.

Dyke said the FA would try to preserve all the traditional Christmas and New Year dates but that is a forlorn hope. With the World Cup final slated for December 23, it is unthinkable that English football could return before the FA Cup third round taking place the first weekend in January.

Even that may be too soon.

UEFA president Michel Platini (right) will be relieved the Champions League won't have to adjust in 2022-23

The announcement has been coming but, even so, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore looked genuinely shocked. Maybe he truly thought disruption to the English calendar could be avoided. How quaint.

Ultimately, just about every other event has been prioritised: the Winter Olympics, religious festivals, the Superbowl and the Champions League. UEFA, to the surprise of few, ratted out the European leagues by pushing for dates that would least affect their prestige competition.

They can rush through the Champions League group stages early, break mid-winter as always, and reconvene with the World Cup a memory. Anything else would have been a huge embarrassment for president Michel Platini, considering he voted for Qatar in the first place.

Also on his soapbox was Karl-Heinz Rummenigge of Bayern Munich and the European Clubs’ Association (to put his responsibilities in his order of priority). He was talking money — specifically compensation for the European clubs. 

As someone who received two free Rolex watches worth £84,000 when the ECA held its annual assembly in Qatar in 2013 — the Qatar 2022 organising committee also picked up the £500,000 tab for the event — he will know the hosts are good for it.

Christmas has come early, it seems — although not in Hartlepool.
