Google has started to roll out its revamped logo and freshly-designed homepage.

At first glance the logo does not look dramatically different but it has in fact been subtly reshaped and flattened with a slightly different colour palette, while the homepage sports a smaller range of links in the Google bar.

The re-design is the first change to Google's logo since 2010, but not all users will be able to see the changes yet on the world's most visited website.

Google is the latest large internet brand to refresh its look, following new logos for Bing and Yahoo and the new logo will be gradually rolled out across the company's products in the next few weeks.

The shadows and bevelling have been removed from the primary coloured lettering of the logo for a flatter appearance, while the colours are slightly more muted to give a more modern look.

The Google bar has been updated to make it more user-friendly on multiple devices.

Eddie Kessler, tech lead and manager at Google, wrote in a blogpost: 'If you're anything like me, you move 
among devices and Google products on a regular basis. You might check 
Gmail on your phone, for instance, then organise your Calendar via 
laptop, then browse Google+ photos from your tablet.

'Regardless
 of your routine, getting around Google should be seamless, and once 
you're inside an app, you don't want any distractions. So we're 
introducing an updated Google bar that streamlines your experience 
across products and devices.'

Google products are now accessible under an 'app launcher' located at the top right of the home page.

Other Google products, including 
Google Drive Storage, YouTube and the Android app Play Store, are 
easy to access as users can click on the corresponding icon made up of 
small tiles.

Carolina Milanesi from Gartner, told the BBC: 'I do think that there is a move to try to make Google+ more central to everything its users do.

'It
 might be the case that it is not obvious to some people that they need 
to click on the box to reveal the firm's other services.'

Less than two weeks ago, sharp-eyed mobile internet users spotted what they thought could be a new logo for the internet search giant in the latest version of Google's mobile internet browser used by app developers.

ars technica reported the cleaner logo was being used for a new tab
 page but it was quickly pulled - presumably by someone who might have 
feared the cat had been let out of the bag, sparking rumours of a re-design.

Yahoo! recently unveiled a new logo to generally negative reviews after teasing the new design with a month of logos.

Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer wrote in a blog about the lengthy process of the re-design.

She said: 'We hadnâ€™t updated our logo in 18 years...We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history.  Having a human touch, personal.  Proud.'
