Only one in 50 people eligible for the government’s free parenting classes have taken advantage of the scheme, official figures have revealed.

A £5million pilot was set up in a number of poor areas following the 2011 riots in England.

Parents of under-fives would be able to claim £100 vouchers to attend classes covering discipline, diet, exercise, family rows, bullying and preparing children for school.

But just two per cent of families have signed up since it was launched seven months ago.

Many of those who did attend classes quickly lost interest. One in five quit the courses before they had completed them.

Last week one of the providers withdrew their services, complaining about poor turn-out and red tape.

Labour seized on the statistics yesterday to attack the Prime Minister’s record on ‘family friendly’ policies.

Shadow Children’s Minister Sharon Hodgson said: ‘David Cameron claimed this would be the most family friendly Government ever, but he’s made ordinary families bear the brunt of cuts to services and financial support, and now his flagship parenting programme is in chaos.

‘The major issue with the parenting class scheme is that it will never reach those families who need the most help. That is why Sure Start centres and outreach programmes are so important, but this government has slashed the budget by more than 40 per cent, with the most deprived areas facing the biggest cuts.

‘David Cameron promised he would provide high quality support for parents but he has failed.’

A total of 22,000 free classes in four pilot areas - Middlesbrough, Bristol, Camden in London and High Peak in Derbyshire - were announced under the scheme.

Parents would pick up vouchers from Boots stores and health workers, entitling them to ten two-hour sessions with organisations such as the National Childbirth Trust.

But children’s charity Montessori St Nicholas last week pulled out of the scheme after just 32 parents turned up.

Problems had included poor marketing and problems with the issuing of vouchers, it said.

Another provider has complained interest has been slack due to lack of publicity, the Observer said yesterday[SUN].

Another measure announced last year alongside the parenting classes was a £3.4 million website.

Parents who signed up to it would receive information by text message and email on how to bring up children after the Prime Minister said it was ‘ludicrous’ that people receive more training when learning to drive.

But he was forced to defend the plans amid concerns about an expanding ‘nanny state’.

Other government proposals to face criticism include the tax-free childcare vouchers worth £1,200 a year per child that are only available to families with two earners.

And there has been widespread criticism of cuts to child benefit that take effect in any family where an individual earns more than £50,000.

Families where two parents both earn just under that sum will be unaffected, meaning they can be paid almost £100,000 without losing any benefits.

The Department for Education said: ‘The CANparent trial... is still being successfully delivered by 13 of the original 14 providers.’
