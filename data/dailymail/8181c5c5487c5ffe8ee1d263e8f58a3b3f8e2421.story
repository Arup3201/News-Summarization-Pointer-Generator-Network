A disturbing video appearing to show men desperately clinging on to the wreckage of a small boat while being shot and killed at sea has emerged on YouTube.

The video, which has not been verified, appears to show fishermen being murdered as they struggle to stay afloat.

The horrific footage, which is too violent to publish in full, lasts for 10 minutes and 26 seconds.

A Fijian police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'We can confirm that we have seen the video and are investigating it.'

At least four men appear to have been murdered at sea in a shocking video that appeared on YouTube. Here one man is seen clinging to an overturned boat as gun shots hit the water around him

Three fishing boats appear in the water, including a Taiwanese tuna longliner, as a man aboard another boat films the shootings in the sea.

Heavy gunfire can be heard at the beginning of the video and around three minutes in the first men floating in the choppy water appear.

Voices coming from the boat that the video is filmed on, translated by ONE News, appear to yell in Vietnamese: 'If you see anyone, just kill'.

Over the tannoy another voice shouts: 'Look ahead there, one and two.'

After around a minute of shooting he appeared to be killed. Another man swam away from the overturned boat but was also shot. The footage shows a man's body sinking into the water surrounded by red blood. Afterwards the men who appear to have carried out the attack posed for photos on their boat (top picture).

Shots ring out as they repeatedly fire at the men in the sea until they are killed and a cloud of red blood spills out into the water.

Then, around four minutes into the video, a man is desperately seen clinging on to the debris of a small overturned boat.

Having spotted him, the men shoot continuously until more blood appears and he begins to sink under water.

The camera pans away but returns when they seem to realise he hasn't died and they continue shooting at him until he finally looses his grip on the debris and sinks into the sea.

The camera then zooms in on the seemingly dead floating bodies of the four men in the water, one of whom is wearing a red and white stripped top and another appears naked, as men aboard the boat can be heard cheering.

At the end of the video they turn the camera on themselves and pose together for selfies on their mobile phones as they appear to congratulate themselves.

It is currently unclear when or where the video was taken but police are reportedly looking for the university student in Suva, Fiji, who uploaded it for more information.
