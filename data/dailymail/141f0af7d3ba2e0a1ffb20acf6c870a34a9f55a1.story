Britons travelling to former French colonies in Africa are at risk of being targeted for hostage-taking by Al Qaeda fighters.

The brother of a former deputy leader of Al Qaeda warned that revenge will be sought for those countries which assisted the French in their crackdown of terrorism in the region.

Mohammed al-Zawahiri, the brother of Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, told French weekly Le Point: 'France is playing with fire... By 
attacking Mali, France lit the fuse and will suffer the consequences.

'The reaction of jihadi fighters is likely to be strong, be it in Mali or on French territory.

'We have neither bombs nor planes, but our resources allow us to take hostages to defend ourselves,' said the Egyptian Islamist.

In January, 330 UK troops were sent to the region to help the French army, push back Islamic extremists who had taken hold of the north, which has now begun a phased withdrawal of its 4,500-strong force.

The Guardian, at the time, reported a 'number of British special forces' troops on the ground in Mali when the country began its stand-off with Al Qaeda terror groups.

But now, Al Qaeda are seeking payback and have western tourists in the region in their sights.

Although the threat has been reported in the French press as primarily against French citizens, it is feared that Al Qaeda in the Magreb (AQIM) terror cells will take all westerners in the region as hostages and will also consider British travellers as fair game, due to Britain’s role in the recent French-led operation there.

AQIM recently made a press statement warning that all countries which helped France would be considered an enemy.

'No one who participated in this 
ferocious attack on our people in north Mali will be safe,' it said in a
recent statement for the press.

Al Qaeda terror cells there are planning on revenge for what they see as attacks which 'killed' their children and are organising themselves to step up kidnapping of holiday makers in the region of west Africa - where Al Qaeda in the Magreb (AQIM) has control, in part, of Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Libya, Burkina Faso and Chad.

France’s military intervention in Mali saw French-led troops recapture key towns in northern Mali that had been occupied for months by Islamist groups linked to Al-Qaeda.

AQIM operates a terrorist network of fighters 4,300-mile-long strip across the Sahel region, including not only Mali but also portions of Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Libya, Burkina Faso and Chad.

The al-Qaida affiliate, which became part of the terror network in 2006, is one of three Islamist groups in northern Mali. AQIM is still believed to be holding five French hostages after announcing earlier this year it had killed one of them.

Lat week, the group said the fate of the remaining captives 'is in the hands of French President Francois Hollande and the door is still open to find a just solution.'

Ayman al-Zawahiri, who succeeded Osama bin Laden as Al-Qaeda chief in 2011, had already warned France at the beginning of April that it would meet in Mali 'the same fate as America in Iraq and Afghanistan.'

It is his brother though, Mohammed, who was jailed in 1999 for acts of terrorism in Egypt – who walked free when Hosni Mubarak fell in 2011, who made the warnings in Paris.
