A controversial satanic 'black mass' coming to Oklahoma City has sold out of tickets, reveals a group co-founder.

The event, to be held on Sept. 21, will also feature a satanic exorcism and has sold all of the available 88 tickets.

The exorcism will be 'toned down' to keep from violating state health laws.

A controversial satanic 'black mass' coming to Oklahoma City has sold out of tickets, reveals a group co-founder.

Dakhma of Angra Mainyu's Adam Daniels said the group would substitute vinegar for the ritual's prescribed urine.

Another concession to state laws will be a woman on an altar wearing lingerie instead of being completely nude.

'One of the dictates of the church is not only to educate the members but to educate the public, and to debunk the Hollywood-projected image of our beliefs,' he told ABC News.

The event, to be held at the city's civic center, will also feature a performance from band 'God in a Machine' and readings that renounce God.

At the end of the night, they will step on and spit upon an unconsecrated host.

Audience members are encouraged to wear black, hooded, full-length robes or evening wear.

The parks and recreation department rented the space for $420 and front row tickets sold for $17.50.

The Christian Post writes that the satanic exorcism is meant to be an inversion of a christian exorcism by inciting rites and incantations to force the holy spirit out of a person's body.

The event had drawn intense criticism from Christians, with Gov. Mary Fallin, Catholic Archbiship Paul Coakley, and over 80,000 others signing an online petition to condemn the gathering.

The group is separate from New York's Satanic Temple which has long battled to have a statue of the devil put up in the state capital

Fallin called it a 'disgusting mockery of the Catholic faith' and something that should be 'equally repellent to Catholics and non-Catholics alike.'

'It may be protected by the First Amendment, but that doesn't mean we can't condemn it in the strongest terms possible for the moral outrage which it is,' she said. 'It is shocking and disgusting that a group of New York City 'satanists' would travel all the way to Oklahoma to peddle their filth here. I pray they realize how hurtful their actions are and cancel this event.'

The group is separate from New York's Satanic Temple which has long battled to have a statue of the devil put up in the state capital.

The city officials said the group is protected by the U.S. Constitution.

'Mr.
 Daniels must abide by our local ordinances, our fire codes and all of 
our state laws,' said Parks and Recreation spokeswoman Jennifer 
Lindsey-McClintock. 'No bloodletting of any kind will be allowed.'
