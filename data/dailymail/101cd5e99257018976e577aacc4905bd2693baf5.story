If you venture into New York, Washington D.C. or Los Angeles you’ll find that house prices are a full 50 per cent above the levels they were 12 years ago - but that’s far from representative of the U.S.

The Housing Misery Index, which looks at changes in home prices from their peak and proportions of houses with seriously-troubled mortgages or foreclosure, is showing where the market is at its worst.

Nevada has the worst misery by some distance - in front of Florida, Arizona and California, which are well above Michigan in fifth. It’s no surprise some experts fear that the U.S. is already in a ‘triple dip’.

‘Big price drops lead to more underwater borrowers and less household wealth, which hurt the housing market and hold back economic recovery,’ said analyst Jed Kolko, who created the index.

‘Second, defaults and foreclosures damage consumer confidence in the housing recovery - and foreclosures cause pain not only for people who lose their homes but also for their neighbours.’

Mr Kolko, chief economist for real estate firm Trulia, added that he only expects the housing crisis to be a major issue on the presidential campaign trail in the states where the index is at its worst.

Republican candidates went to Florida in January and Nevada and Arizona in February, but there is a long gap until California in June - which may cause their debating on housing to die down for now.

Struggling: The index comes as it was revealed earlier this week that U.S. home prices fell for the fourth straight month in December, closing the year at a new low and erasing gains seen in the summer

Idaho and Georgia have the worst housing misery index figures for states voting on Super Tuesday next week - and of those voting in April the worst measure is in Rhode Island and Maryland, he said.

The index comes as it was revealed earlier this week that U.S. home prices fell for the fourth straight month in December, closing the year at a new low and erasing gains seen in the summer.

The S&P Case-Shiller home price index fell 1.1 per cent in December across the 20 major U.S. cities surveyed, a 4 per cent decline from a year earlier. Only Miami and Phoenix saw gains in December.

In the Portland area, the index showed a decline of 0.4 per cent, leaving prices 4 per cent lower than the same month in 2010. Prices are lower than a year earlier in all of the cities except Detroit.

Wednesday's news deflated hopes for a robust recovery in prices, but brokers and observers said it belies strong sales activity and doesn't necessarily mean the bottom is falling out again.
