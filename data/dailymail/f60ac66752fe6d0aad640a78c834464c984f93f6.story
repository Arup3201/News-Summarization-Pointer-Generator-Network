A new knife is hoping to solve the age-old problem of spreading butter straight from the fridge.

The SpreadTHAT! blade uses a heat-transfer system that captures a users body heat to melt through hard butter.

The advanced technology means that the device requires no batteries, charging or power of any sort.

At last: The SpreadTHAT! blade (pictured) uses a revolutionary heat-transfer system that harnesses body heat to melt through hard butter. It uses a copper alloy tube which transfers heat from the palm to the blade

Its designers developed the device using a copper alloy tube which instantly transfers heat from the palm of a hand to the end of the blade.

Weighing just 3oz (85g), it uses no electric or batteries, no heating or hot water, and most importantly, requires no heat-up period.

The device has proved a success on crowdfunding website Kickstarter, surpassing its $20,000 (£12,400)  target within days.

Writing on their Kickstarter page, the company said: 'We discovered that the current butter spreaders on the market are simply not adequate for spreading butter.

'We wanted to create a spreader that can effectively spread cold butter, and we wanted to do it without using any electricity nor hot water.

'We also demanded a solution that is completely safe to handle by small children, meaning that there cannot be any sharp edges.

The smart crockery works on the principle that heat always flows in the direction of lower temperature (graph of temperature changed pictured). The heart of the device features a copper alloy tube similar to that used to cool down computer processors in the semiconductor manufacturing industry

It draws heat from your palm and transfers it onto the butter, making the butter easier to spread.

'After months of ideation, experiments and prototyping, we finally have our solution.'

The Kickstarter campaign, which launched at the start of August, has now raised $33,500 with 18 days left to go.

The team behind the device, based in Seattle, hope to have the product in mass production in time for Christmas.

The designers were inspired by the age-old problem, saying: 'We discovered that the current butter spreaders on the market are simply not adequate for spreading butter.'

Grate invention: Another new butter knife named ButterUp was recently revealed by different designers (pictured). The gadget aims to solve the problem of refrigerated butter but grating it
