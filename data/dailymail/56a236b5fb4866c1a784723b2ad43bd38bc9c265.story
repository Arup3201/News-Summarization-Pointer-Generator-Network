Barack Obama appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday and kept things lighthearted save for a discussion of recent events in Ferguson, Missouri. 

After poking fun at himself by reading mean tweets people have written about him among other self-deprecating bits, Obama reflected on Wednesday night's shooting of two police officers in racially tense Ferguson, Missouri, just days after he had delivered a speech on racial healing in Selma, Alabama. 

'Whoever fired those shots should not detract from the issue - they are criminals, they need to be arrested. And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides - law enforcement, who have a terrifically tough job, and people who understandably don't want to be stopped and harassed just because of their race - that they are able to work together to come up with some good answers.'

The president simultaneously addressed the Justice Department's findings about police behavior in Ferguson that led up to last summer's mass protests.

'What had been happening was questionable and objectionable and should have been protested,' the president said.

He went on to refer to findings that the town had intentionally targeted African American citizens for ticketing and arrest largely as a means of making money.

'There was a whole structure, according to the justice department, that indicated racism' he said.

The president was careful to hedge his bets between protesters and police, though.

'In the same way you can't generalize about police officers...you can't generalize against protesters,' he said, while maintaining firmly that those who fired at police were criminals and the exception to the rule.

In Washington, President Barack Obama had already taken to Twitter to relay his prayers to the officers and to denounce violence against police. 'Path to justice is one all of us must travel together,' Obama wrote, signing the tweet with his initials to indicate the president personally composed it

The shootings marked the first time in more than seven months of tension in Ferguson that officers were shot at a protest, and the bloodshed threatened to inflame the already fraught relationship between police and protesters just as the city seeks reforms in the wake of a withering Justice Department report on racial bias in its law-enforcement practices.

The attack also seemed to create another layer of race-related mistrust after a week in which an unarmed young black man was killed by a white officer in Madison, Wisconsin, and a University of Oklahoma fraternity chapter was thrown off campus after a video surfaced showing members singing a racist chant.

Attorney General Eric Holder said the gunman was 'a damn punk' who was 'trying to sow discord in an area that was trying to get its act together, trying to bring together a community that had been fractured for too long.'

Obama's appearance on Jimmy Kimmel came hours after wo police officers were shot early Thursday morning in front of the Ferguson Police Department during a protest following the resignation of the city's police chief
