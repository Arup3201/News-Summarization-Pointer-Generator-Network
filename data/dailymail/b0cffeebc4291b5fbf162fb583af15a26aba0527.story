Mo Farah will double up in the 5,000 metres and 10,000m at this summer's Commonwealth Games as he bids to achieve a unique treble on the track.

The 31-year-old is already ready the reigning world and Olympic champion at both distances and will go for two more gold medals in Glasgow.

Farah is part of a 129-strong England team named on Monday, which includes Olympic champion Greg Rutherford in the long jump and former triple jump world champion Phillips Idowu.

Double Olympic champion Mo Farah intends to compete for England in the 5,000 and 10,000m at this summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

But there is no place for James Dasaolu, Britain's No1 sprinter last year, in the 100m or the 4 x 100m relay, or 20-year-old Chijindu Ujah, who broke the 10-second barrier earlier this month.

World junior 100m champion Adam Gemili, world 60m gold medallist Richard Kilty and Harry Aikines-Aryeety will be England's three representatives, while Dwain Chambers, Andy Robertson and Mark Lewis-Francis make up the 4x100m squad.

Dasaolu, the second quickest British man in history, has yet to open his outdoor season after suffering a hamstring injury in February, although British Athletics performance director Neil Black said there was 'no reason' why the sprinter will not appear at the British Championships in Birmingham at the end of the month.

World 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu, meanwhile, will only take part in the 4 x 400m relay, while Katarina Johnson-Thompson and 17-year-old Morgan Lake have been selected in the heptathlon.
