Britain’s spy agencies have been ordered to break up the ‘dark web’ used by paedophiles to share sick child abuse images online.

Prime Minister David Cameron said he wanted GCHQ to do more to find those trying to ‘hide from justice’ by using encrypted internet networks.

It comes ahead of a Downing Street summit where web firm Google  will pledge to block internet search results linked to child abuse around the world.

Mr Cameron has made clear that he 
wants more to be done to protect internet users from vile images online 
while trying to catch those responsible for the abuse.

He
 has tasked GCHQ intelligence experts to try to track those using secret
 links – known as the ‘dark web’ - to share photographs of child abuse.

The
 National Crime Agency estimates that the number of people in the UK 
using encrypted networks has risen by two-thirds and is expected to hit 
20,000-a-day by the end of this year.

Some
 people could be using them legally, but police and intelligence 
agencies believe paedophiles use such networks to distribute child abuse
 material.

Mr Cameron said: 
‘There has been a lot in the news recently about the techniques, 
ability, and brilliance of the people involved in the intelligence 
community and GCHQ and the NSA in America.

'That expertise
 is going to be brought to bear to go after on these revolting people 
sharing these images on the dark net and making them available more 
widely,' he told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show.

Britain's
 National Crime Agency is joining forces with America's FBI in a new 
transatlantic taskforce to target paedophiles who use encrypted networks
 online.

Mr Cameron added: 'This is a day when 
we can make some real progress against the absolute evil of child abuse 
and what happens on the internet.

'The
 next stage is now to go after the dark net where people are sharing 
images peer to peer away from the Googles and the Microsofts.

'Again
 there is a lot more we can do, working with the industry, making sure 
we have got law enforcement which have got all the modern technological 
tools at their disposal and we will go after these people and arrest 
them and bang them up as well.

'The
 point is that you use technology which is able to get into the dark 
internet, which is able decrypt encrypted files and that is able to find
 out what is going on.

'Like
 all these things, if you put in the resources and the effort, if you 
use the best brains, the brains that are, as it were, the inheritors to 
the people that decrypted the enigma code in the Second World War, if 
you take those brains and apply it to the problem of tackling child 
abuse online you will get results.'

Anyone using internet technology leaves some form of ‘digital footprints’ which GCHQ will try to link to individuals.

This intelligence will be used by the National Crime Agency to track and arrest offenders.

Several paedophiles have already been arrested as a result of the initiative.

The
 move comes four months after Mr Cameron demanded tougher action to end 
the spread of child abuse images online and to protect children from 
seeing pornography on the internet.

The involvement of GCHQ action will also see the National Crime Agency join America's FBI in a new transatlantic taskforce to target paedophiles who use encrypted networks online.

No 10 said that the UK-US taskforce is being established by the US assistant attorney general and the British to target criminals who use the internet to hide from the law.

It will bring together the newly formed National Crime Agency and its American counterpart, the FBI, as well as other US law enforcement agencies.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Child abuse online is not restricted by international borders and so neither must our response.

‘Parents on both sides of the Atlantic rightly expect us to take action on this and that is why we have reached out to secure a much closer working relationship with our American partners.

‘This agreement will only strengthen our ability to crack down on this type of sickening crime.’

At the same time a group of industry experts is being set up to look at new technical solutions for removing child abuse material from the internet.

Joanna Shields, the chief executive of Tech City UK, said it would be looking to spot the ‘threats of future’ to protect the most vulnerable in society.

‘It's vital that governments and industry work together to eradicate child abuse content from the internet, and that we mobilise the best and brightest in the technology industry to come up with innovative solutions to tackling this problem,’ she said.
