UKIP is on course to take enough Tory votes to put Ed Miliband in power next year, according to a poll of marginal constituencies.

The survey of ten Conservative-held seats suggests the anti-EU party could tip the balance in favour of Labour in all but two of them.

The findings will reinforce the central Tory message that Ukip voters risk handing the election to Mr Miliband, who has effectively ruled out holding a referendum on EU membership. 

New polling shows voters deserting the Tories for Ukip will put Ed Miliband within touching distance of No10

But the poll, conducted for former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, is not all good news for Mr Miliband.

It suggests he may have less chance of winning than he hopes because in seats where Ukip is performing really well there are fewer voters switching directly to Labour from Tory.

Lord Ashcroft questioned more than 1,000 voters in Conservative-held constituencies where Labour came second in 2010.

The survey found a overall 5 per cent swing to Labour in these marginals – enough to snatch nine of them (Brentford & Isleworth, Brighton Kemptown, Corby, Enfield North, Halesowen & Rowley Regis, Hastings & Rye, Hove, Ipswich and Nuneaton).

But where Ukip is doing well, Labour might not achieve a 5 per cent swing, because voters who might otherwise have switched straight from blue to red have opted instead for Ukip. 

Lord Ashcroft said that, coupled with previous surveys in more marginal Tory-held constituencies, the results suggested at least 29 seats would fall to Labour if the findings were repeated at the general election.

But he said the swing varied ‘significantly’ depending on the Ukip presence in each seat, with a strong showing from Nigel Farage’s party enough to deny Mr Miliband a lead in Pudsey and Gloucester and threaten his chances in Halesowen.

‘Though nine of these seats would change hands on the basis of these snapshots, Labour will not feel comfortable in many of them,’ said Lord Ashcroft.

Prime Minister David Cameron has lost crucial swing voters to Labour in marginal constituencies which hold the key to winning the next election

‘Though Labour led by ten points in Enfield North and 13 points in Brentford, they were ahead by less than five points in Brighton Kemptown, Hove, Halesowen & Rowley Regis and Nuneaton.

‘Swings to Labour appear to be related to the Ukip presence, which varied significantly from one seat to the next.

‘Nigel Farage’s party scored just 7 per cent in Brentford & Isleworth, where Labour’s share was up 11 points since 2010, but 24 per cent in Halesowen, where Labour were down by two points, though still just ahead.’

The findings will fuel concern in Mr Miliband’s party that complacency about the impact on Labour of the Ukip surge could rob them of victory next year.

The Lib Dem vote had fallen by more than half in nearly all seats surveyed, with just 23 per cent of those who voted Lib Dem in 2010 saying they would do so again.

In Corby the poll took into account the 2012 by-election. The seat had been won by the Tories in 2010 but went Labour when Louise Mensch resigned in 2012. The poll predicts Labour will hold the seat.

Meanwhile, a separate poll by Ipsos Mori revealed proposed tax cuts are the most popular policies to emerge from the recent party conference season.
