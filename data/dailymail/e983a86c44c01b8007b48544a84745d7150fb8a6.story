Cringe: After singer Tom Odell was given a big fat zero in a review in  NME, his father rang the music magazine's offices to complain

Whether it's enthusiastically enjoying air guitar to Dire Straits at a family wedding, or telling your friends humiliating stories, everyone knows what it's like to be embarrassed by their father.

However, when you're a Brit Award-winning singer on the cusp of super-stardom, it's probably a bit more cringe-worthy.

So pity poor musician Tom Odell, whose father rang up the offices of music magazine NME to blast its writers for giving his son a rare 0 out of 10 for his album Long Way Down.

NME reviewer Mark Beaumont unleashed his full critical fury, describing the 22-year-old singer from Chichester as a 'poor, misguided wannabe who's fallen into the hands of the music industry equivalent of Hungarian sex traffickers'.

He added: 'I wish I could say there's a place in Hell reserved for Tom Odell. There's not. Just loads more Brits.

'He'll be all over 2013 like a virulent dose of musical syphilis, pounding and warbling away at every papal election and Bradley Wiggins finishing line.'

The magazine puts the boot in even further, justifying the zero grade by saying you 'can't unhear' the music, reportsÂ The Independent.

Lucy Jones, the deputy editor of the 
magazine's website, posted a message on Twitter saying that her 
staff had taken an angry phone call from the elder Mr Odell after the issue hit newsstands.

Some indignant music fans took to Twitter to voice their anger at Mr Beaumont's scathing review of privately-educated Odell, famous for songs like 'Another Love' and 'Hold Me', as a publicity stunt.

Music critic Simon Price tweeted: 'Shameless showboating by NME, giving awful Tom Odell 0/10. Give your core indie acts more sub-5/10 marks and we'll believe you've got b****.'

He also claimed NME was unwilling to 
unfavourably review bands its readers enjoy, such as Beady Eye, fronted 
by former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher.

In the latest edition of NME (pictured) reviewer Mark Beaumont said: 'I wish I could say there's a place in Hell reserved for Tom Odell (right). There's not. Just loads more Brits'

'In case anyone missed that, the NME that gave Tom Odell 0/10 is the same NME that gave Beady Eye 7/10. "Which", "side", "bread", "buttered",' he added.

Mr Beaumont defended the review, tweeting: 'It's an honest reaction to a record that cynically combines everything dull and despicable about mainstream music.'

Tom Odell's agent Frazer Lawton refused to comment. A spokesman for NME did not respond to requests for comment.
