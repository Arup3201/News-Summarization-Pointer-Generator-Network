African leaders yesterday agreed to co-operate in declaring ‘war’ on the Boko Haram Islamist militants.

At a meeting hosted by Francois Hollande, President of France, the leaders of Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon, Niger and Chad agreed to pool intelligence and resources in a bid to beat the terrorists.

'Boko Haram is no longer a local 
terrorist group, it is operating clearly as an al Qaeda operation, it is
 an al Qaeda of West Africa,' Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan told a
 news conference in Paris following the meeting.

'We have shown our 
commitment for a regional approach. Without West African countries 
coming together we will not be able to crush these terrorists,' he said.

'There is determination to tackle this situation head on ... to launch a war, a total war on Boko Haram,' Chad's President Idriss Deby said.

'The threat is serious and dangerous for the region, Africa and Europe,' French President Francois Hollande said, although no concrete operational measures were announced.

Earlier, Foreign Secretary William Hague had offered to send advisers to help Nigeria tackle the threat of Boko Haram.

He spoke as protesters chanted ‘bring back our girls’ as they took part in a march to Downing Street to deliver a petition calling on African governments to do more to defeat Boko Haram.

Around 80 demonstrators, many with signs and placards, took part in the rally, which began outside the Nigeria High Commission in Westminster.

Organiser Amour Owolabi said people had travelled from cities such as Birmingham and Manchester to take part.

He added: ‘We’re here today to call on the international community to bring back our girls. The Nigerian government should have done a lot more.’
