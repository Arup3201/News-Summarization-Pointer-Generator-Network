I thought we had seen everything in this World Cup, but that first half was absolutely unbelievable.

I wrote on Monday that I feared for Brazil. Yes, they have talent but they have been playing off the cuff and relying on pure passion to get them through.

And it finally caught up with them. The Germans were their first proper test but they are a good team, not a great team. Brazil were utterly shambolic and made them look like world-beaters.

Luiz is not a defender

David Luiz has been one of the main men for Brazil in this tournament, but he went back to exactly what he is: a midfielder playing in defence.

After two minutes he was charging around in the final third like a striker and he has no interest in his defensive duties.

By the end of the first half he looked like he’d given up. It’s all well and good scoring 35-yard free-kicks, but I want my defenders to defend.

He was badly at fault for the first goal and did not look much like a £50million defender.

No case for the defence

The Brazil defence was appalling, but three of the back four would rather play elsewhere.

I thought Maicon was finished after he was terrorised by Gareth Bale and Luiz and Marcelo want to play in midfield. 

Elsewhere they looked slow and Luiz Felipe Scolari has to shoulder a lot of the blame.

Yes
 they missed Neymar and Thiago Silva, but they have been disorganised 
all tournament. They finally met a side who could exploit that.

Not up to it: Maicon was found out by the German attack

Ruthless Germany

Brazil completely lost it in the first half but credit the Germans. So often you see teams collapse but the opposition can’t take full advantage.

Not the Germans. They were absolutely ruthless in front of goal.

Specialist Klose

In England we would have written off Miroslav Klose by now for being too old.

His selection will have raised eyebrows in Germany but it shows imagination from Joachim Low to pick a specialist and proves Germany have the perfect blend of youth and experience.
