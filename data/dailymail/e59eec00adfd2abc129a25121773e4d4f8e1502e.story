A pastor accused of beating and strangling a neighbor to fulfill a sexual fantasy was engaged to the victim's mother and had asked church members to pray for the young woman before police found her body, a friend said on Friday.

Ex-convict John D. White, from Michigan, told investigators that after killing 24-year-old Rebekah Gay in her trailer in rural Isabella County early on Wednesday, he hid her body in nearby woods then returned to the trailer to dress her three-year-old son in a Halloween costume, ready for the boy's father to pick him up.

White told investigators he repeatedly struck Gay's head with a mallet then strangled her with a zip tie, according to the Isabella County sheriff's office.

Victim: Rebekah Gay's three-year-old son was home when his mother was attacked

He said he stripped her but does not remember if he carried out his fantasy of having sex with Gay's dead body.

'We are all absolutely floored,' said
Donna Houghton, 76, who had a role in hiring White to be pastor at the 
14-member Christ Community Fellowship three years ago.

She said she 
protested his innocence until she heard he had confessed.

'Then he had no leg to stand on,' she told The Associated Press.

White led investigators to Gay's body
in a wooded area a half-mile away from the trailer park and later 
Wednesday was charged with first-degree murder. He remained jailed 
without bond on Friday.

Gay and White lived in the same 
trailer park in Broomfield Township, 85 miles northwest of Lansing, and 
White was engaged to Gay's mother who was a regular at his Sunday 
sermons, Houghton said.

She said the pastor often watched Gay's son 
while she was at work.

White 'really liked this young man,' Sheriff Leo Mioduszewski said.

Houghton said that before White was 
arrested he had called her to ask that she contact other church members 
and start a prayer chain for Gay, who was still missing at the time.

'He was pretty shook up. He said the police were giving him a hard time,' Houghton said.

Confession: Wearing a 'suicide prevention suit', White confessed to hiding Gay's naked body after beating her to death but says he cannot remember whether he acted out his fantasy of having sex with her body

She said the tiny congregation was aware of White's criminal past when he joined the church.

He was released from prison in 2007 
after serving nearly 12 years for manslaughter in the death of a 
26-year-old woman in Kalamazoo County, according to the state 
Corrections Department.

White also was sentenced to probation for choking and stabbing a 17-year-old Battle Creek girl in 1981.

'He was absolutely contrite,' 
Houghton said. 'All kinds of people turn around and meet the Lord and 
they are a different person.

'He was doing a lot of good in the 
community... He was doing a lot of good and Satan did not want him doing
good, and Satan got to him.'
