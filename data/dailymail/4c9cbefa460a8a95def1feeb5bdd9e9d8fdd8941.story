The makers of a film based on the scandal surrounding former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss Khan claim the French establishment tried to block production.

The film, Welcome to New York, sees Gerard Depardieu play a 'Mr Deveraux' – said to be modelled after the powerful French politician, who was once a front-runner to become the president of France.

The movie tells the story of Mr Deveraux, who is accused of the attempted rape of a chamber maid in a Manhattan hotel room.

The very adult-themed trailer offers several scenes of Mr Depardieu's character engaging in orgies, having sex with prostitutes and seducing young women.

The film is said to echo the real-life story of Mr Strauss-Kahn, who once faced accusations that he tried to rape women in both New York and Paris. However, the charges against him were dropped.

The two-hour film, which also stars Nip/Tuck actress Jacqueline Bisset as the character Mr Deveraux’s wife, is set to have its world premiere at midnight on Friday in a private showing on the beach in Cannes.

However, it has been excluded from the official programme of the Cannes International Film Festival, which starts on Wednesday.

Vincent Maraval, producer of the film says the French elite tried to block the making of the movie claining there is an ‘incestuous relationship between the media and political elite’ in France.

He told the Independent: ‘No French TV station wanted to finance us.

‘Everyone warned us not to make this film, both our friends and our enemies.’

It has also been reported that Mr Depardieu put some of his own money into making the film, and only took a fee of 100,000 euros for playing the character.

The film will not be shown in French cinemas and will be released on video-on-demand websites.

It will appear in cinemas in other countries, including the UK, at a later date.

In 2011 Mr Strauss-Kahn was accused by Nafissatou Diallo, a New York chamber maid, of trying to rape her.

Lawyers for Mr Strauss-Kahn proved that a sex act which took place was consensual, but he was forced to step down from his $500,000 a-year job at the International Monetary Fund.

Diallo then sued Mr Strauss-Kahn, but the two sides reached a financial settlement late last year, the details of which have never been disclosed.
