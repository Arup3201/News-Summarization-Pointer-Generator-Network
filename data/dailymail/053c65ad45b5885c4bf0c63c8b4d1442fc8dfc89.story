A woman who shot dead an off-duty policeman before turning the weapon on herself had previously tried to sue a traffic officer.

Otto Thomas rang 911 after she gunned down Larry Tuttle and told the operator she had killed her boyfriend as he was allegedly about to hit her again.

The 42-year-old then blasted herself as police surrounded the officer's home in Dallas, Texas, and urged her to give herself up.

It has been revealed that Thomas had previously filed a $1 million lawsuit against another officer for blowing kisses at her in a traffic stop in November 2012, according to WFAA.com.

Otto Thomas, 42, rang 911 to report that she had shot dead off-duty police officer Larry Tuttle, 40, at his home in Dallas, Texas

Records at Bexar County Court show that Thomas unsuccessfully tried to sue Universal City, its police department and Officer Corey Vullo, the website reported.

She alleged that Officer Vullo made inappropriate sexual advances towards her after pulling her vehicle over and on an online dating website.

Officer Vullo denied the allegations and the case was dismissed last year, WFAA.com reported.

Thomas called 911 around 6:15pm on Saturday to report that she had shot dead 40-year-old Officer Tuttle and needed his colleagues to come and pick up her six-year-old daughter. 

She told the operator: 'He was getting ready to hit me again and I just went off. I killed him because he was going to hit me again.'

Officers  have not found any evidence at the scene that supports Thomas' claim.

Left behind: SWAT teams stormed Tuttle's apartment and found the couple dead, with Thomas' 6-year-old daughter uninjured in a bedroom

When they arrived at the scene they ordered the Thomas to drop the weapon and leave the apartment.

Moments later a gunshot was heard from inside the building. 

SWAT teams swarmed the apartment and found the couple dead, with Thomas' young daughter uninjured in a bedroom.

Her daughter, who neighbors say is autistic, has been transferred to the care of Child Protective Services, which are trying to get in contact with Thomas' family in Mississippi.

Police say there have been no prior disturbance or domestic violence calls to the apartment.

Tuttle's wife Kandie Morgan told KXAS- TV that they had been separated for a few months, and that he had been a great father to their 10-year-old son.

Police are unsure whether Thomas was living with Tuttle at the apartment. They say she recently lived in an apartment in Arlington.
