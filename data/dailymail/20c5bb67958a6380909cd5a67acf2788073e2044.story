A boss at the Royal Horticultural Society has appeared in court charged with conspiracy to steal nearly £700,000 from the charity over a 10 year period.

Stuart Medhurst, 54, of no fixed address, is accused of two counts of conspiracy to steal and one count of fraud by abuse of position.

The charges relate to his time while he was working as head of operations at the world famous gardening organisation.

Stuart Medhurst, left, who appeared at Westminster Magistrates today, accused conspiracy to steal nearly £700,000. He appeared alongside Shaheen Kadri, right, who allegedly received £317,110 from Medhurst over a 10 year period 

He is alleged to have used his position at the Royal Horticultural Society to obtain £43,000 worth of goods and services for himself between 2007 and 2014.

He was in the dock alongside Shaheen Kadri, 43, of Camden, North London and Elaine Summers, 53, of Notting Hill, West London, who are both charged with one count of conspiracy to steal.

It is alleged Kadri received £317,110 from Medhurst between January 2004 and January last year, and Summers took £360,859 over the same period

Richard Doolan, prosecuting, said: 'They are all charged with a conspiracy which relates to around £700,000 paid out of the Royal Horticultural Society bank account

‘Around £300,000 was paid out to a bank account controlled by Ms Summers and around another £300,000 was paid into an account controlled by Mr Kadri.

‘The fraud relates to around £43,000 worth of goods that Mr Medhurst obtained while being a manager employed by the Royal Horticultural Society.

The charges relate to Medhurst's time while he was working as head of operations at the Royal Horticultural Society, whose headquarters in Surrey are pictured 

'It relates to the wider conspiracy.'

The Royal Horticultural Society, set up in 1804, is the world’s biggest gardening charity.

It organises prestigious exhibitions every year including the Hampton Court Palace and Chelsea Flower Shows.

All three defendants spoke only to confirm their identities during the brief hearing.

Grey-haired Medhurst, wearing a maroon jumper, showed no emotion as the charges were outlined to the court by the prosecutor.

They were released on unconditional bail ahead of a preliminary hearing at Southwark Crown Court on February 11.

No pleas have yet been entered.
