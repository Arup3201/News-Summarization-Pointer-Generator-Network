A drone has captured footage of an enormous great white shark as it swam just off the coast of a beach in Western Australia.

The four metre long shark was seen swimming through the crystal clear waters of Esperence in the state's south when it was spotted.

The footage was captured by a documentary maker who is trying to see whether the sounds of killer whales could help deter sharks from beaches.

The sighting comes just after the government announced it was looking into the use of drones to monitor beaches to help protect swimmers from possible attacks last year.

Great Whites are an endangered species of shark which can grow up to six metres in length and weigh about 2,268 kilograms.

According to National Geographic, they can detect a single drop of blood in 100 litres of water and can sense blood from up to five kilometres away.
