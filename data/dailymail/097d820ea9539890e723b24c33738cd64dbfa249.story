Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has accused the G7 leaders of 'cynicism without limit' for backing Ukraine's military operation against pro-Russian insurgents.

World leaders at a G7 summit in Brussels have condemned Russia for 'continuing violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine'.

In a joint communique released at the summit yesterday, the leaders encouraged Ukraine to 'maintain a measured approach in pursuing operations to restore law and order.'

'The so-called G7 even talks about the measured actions of the Ukrainian army against its own people,' Medvedev told ministers, quoted by the Interfax news agency.

'This is cynicism without limit.'

The G7 leaders had effectively expelled Russia from their annual gathering, which President Vladimir Putin had been due to to host in Sochi, following its annexation of Crimea.

Leaders at the summit have called for Russia to 'stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border and to exercise its influence among armed separatists to lay down their weapons and renounce violence.'

President Barack Obama yesterday accused Russia of reverting to the ‘dark tactics of the 20th century’ in Ukraine.

In a blunt warning to President Putin, he added: ‘The days of empires and spheres of influence are over.’

Speaking at the celebration marking the 25th anniversary of Poland's first partially free election, Obama seeked to offer assurances to the country and its neighbours left nervous by Putin's annexation of Crimea and other threatening moves.

Obama vowed to come to the defence of 
Poland and other NATO allies, declaring that an attack on one member 
country would be an attack on them all.

He also reaffirmed his 
commitment to seeking congressional support for up to $1 billion for a 
'European Reassurance Initiative' that would boost the American military
 presence on the continent.

'After
 investing so much blood and treasure to bring Europe together, we 
refuse to allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define the 
21st,' he said.

Leaders at the G7 summit last night warned that they stood ready to impose damaging economic sanctions on Russia on top of the asset freezes and travel bans already in place.

'We stand ready to intensify targeted sanctions and to implement significant additional restrictive measures to impose further costs on Russia should events so require,' they said in the joint communique.

With talks
 continuing today in Brussels, Prime Minister David Cameron said that it
 was essential that they presented a united front in the face of 
continuing violence by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

'The
 G7 should send a clear message of support to Ukraine and a united 
message to President Putin that he needs to engage with the Ukrainian 
government to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis,' he said.

'That's
 what I'll be saying to President Putin myself. This is the first summit
 without Russia since the 1990s. And until they change course, they need
 to understand that they will face continuing isolation and no seat at 
the table.'

Mr Putin is expected to hear a similar message from other European leaders attending the D-Day commemorations - although US president Barack Obama has made clear that he is not prepared to meet him. 

A topless activist has destroyed a waxwork of Russian President Vladimir Putin at a museum in France in an act of protest.

The activist from the Femen feminist group attacked the statue of the Russian president at the Grevin museum, in Paris.

The waxwork representing Putin had been situated in the museum next to other waxworks of Spain's King Juan Carlos, U.S President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande.

Femen, which began in Eastern Europe, is notorious for using nudity to promote their message of female emancipation and protest against governments and organisations with which they disagree.

They famously confronted Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a trade fair in Hanover last year, while they have also protested at Paris Fashion Week and Germany's Next Top Model.

It was reported last month that founder member and leader of FEMEN France, Inna Shevchenko, 23, had thrown open the doors of the organisation's Paris HQ to a British film crew.

Shevchenko, who was given political asylum in France last year, has masterminded the expansion of the feminist organisation, adding branches in Canada, Germany and Israel to the original Ukrainian movement.
