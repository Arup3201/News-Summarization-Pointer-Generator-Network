Jennifer Lawrence has been seen on holiday in Hawaii enjoying a suspicious rolled up cigarette.

In revealing pictures the newly anointed Oscar-winning actress is seen clasping a fat roll up in her fingers and a bottle of wine.

And in other pictures that have emerged the 22-year-old can clearly be seen taking a draw on the roll up.

It may come as some surprise just days 
after the actress was seen lapping up the applause of her peers at the 
Academy Awards where she took home the Best Actress award for her 
stunning turn in Silver Linings Playbook.

The Silver Linings Playbook star 
looked happy and relaxed, which may well have been in part thanks to a 
glass of wine and her cheeky smoke.

It's not clear if she was indeed smoking marijuana - but the actress is not known to be a smoker - and if the young starlet does have a penchant for the weed, it may explain her propensity for stumbling.

Jennifer, 22, is in Hawaii with a female friend who she was seen hugging as they sat on the balcony together.

The Hunger Games star wrapped herself up in a grey blanket and wore a gray T-shirt from Reformation and sweat pants.

Her girl pal wore a pair of heart-print pyjama shorts and a grey vest and both women were make-up free.

Jennifer will no doubt be enjoying her moment after scooping Best Actress at The Oscars last Sunday.

The
 Kentucky-born star might have enjoyed a relaxing afternoon with her 
friend on Wednesday but she is actually in Hawaii for work, to re-shoot 
scenes for Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

Jennifer won herself even more fans 
on Sunday after laughing at herself after tripping up on the stairs 
after being named Best Actress.

'Thank
 you so much,' she told them. 'This is nuts. You guys are only standing 
up because I fell and you feel bad. That was embarrassing.'

The day after her big award win Jennifer was seen visiting a hair salon in Beverly Hills to dye her hair back to black.
