When you're the Queen, the role of 'back seat driver' becomes a rather more esteemed position.

It means full control of a 'traffic light system' - with the capability of ordering the driver when to stop, slow or start at the touch of the button.

Her Majesty commissioned a green Land Rover Series III in 1978 with such functions and it is now up for sale to the highest bidder.

The Royal vehicle, built for the Queen, is expected to fetch between £15,00 and £18,000 when it goes up for sale at an auction

The vehicle comes complete with a 'traffic light' system which the Queen used to control the driver of the time and tell them when she wanted to stop, slow down or start the journey

In 1979 the vehicle was sent to a workshop where engineers fitted the 4x4 with an unconventional ‘traffic light system’, allowing Queen Elizabeth II to control the vehicle.

And despite being almost 35 years old, the car - dubbed The Queen’s Land Rover - has covered just 1,892 miles from new and appears to be in almost perfect condition.

The vehicle, perfect for a Head of State, is being sold by the Ministry of Defence.

The industrious off-roader is being auctioned on Saturday November 24 at the Historics at Brooklands near Weybridge, Surrey.

It is being offered at the bargain estimate of between £15,000 and £18,000 but, because it is owned by the MoD, is subject to VAT if sold within the EU.

A Land Rover used by Sir Winston Churchill recently sold for £129,000 - more than twice its initial estimate.

And Frank King, from the Land Rover Series 3 Owners Club, believes £15,000 for the Queen’s old model would be a bargain.

He said: 'It is a very special model and I am sure it will attract a lot of interest.

'The fact it was used by the Queen makes it all the more interesting and a £15,000 estimate seems stupidly low.

'I think it will sell for a lot more with that provenance and hopefully it will go to a museum and someone will look after it.'

The Series III was the most common Land Rover with 440,000 built at the company’s factory in Solihull between 1971 and 1985.

Designed to be robust and easy to repair, it has been claimed that 70 per cent of all Land Rovers are still on the road - although very few will have a mileage as low as the Queen’s.

Edward Bridger-Stille, director at Historics Auction, said: 'We are excited and honoured to be entrusted with the task of finding a new home for such a unique vehicle.

'We pride ourselves on bringing distinctive vehicles to auction, and despite prolific production of the Series III Land Rover, it’s highly unlikely one like this will ever come to auction again.'
