Deceased: Jason Kortz has been identified as the Navy SEAL who fell to his death during a training exercise in Southern California

Navy officials say a SEAL killed when his parachute malfunctioned during training in Southern California was a 29-year-old Colorado man who completed basic training to become a SEAL last year.

Naval Special Warfare Group One said Thursday that Jason Kortz of Highlands Ranch, Colorado, died from injuries sustained during the accident in Perris on Wednesday. The Navy is investigating why the parachute malfunctioned. It released no further details.

Naval Special Warfare Group One is the Coronado-based SEALs group to which the sailor was assigned.

Kortz enlisted in the Navy in 2012 and completed basic training for the SEALs last year in Coronado.

He is survived by his wife, parents and brother. 

KABC-TV captured an aerial shot of the commando's body on the ground covered by an American flag with first responders gathered around.

Paramedics apparently received a report around 9am on Wednesday that there was a 'skydiver down' at a grassy location outside of Perris in Riverside County. 

The sailor died of injuries sustained in the daytime parachute jump but no other details were immediately available.

Kortz was identified by officials as a West Coast-based member of the Naval Special Warfare Group ONE. 

All Navy SEALS are required to take parachute jump course during their qualification training.

During missions they are often air-dropped into extremely difficult-to-reach places meaning they  must know how to navigate different heights and terrains.

Indeed, the  SEAL name is short for sea, air and land.

Perris is a popular area for skydivers with one of the largest skydiving centers in the world, Skydive Perris.

The facility declined to comment on Wednesday's skydiving fatality.

This was at least the 20th death reported at the Perris facility since 2000.

The last death occurred last November, when  Justin Gulley, 36, of Canyon Lake was involved in a landing accident.
