Two teenagers have been jailed for setting fire to a man's genitals with a home-made flame thrower, leaving him with third degree burns.

Jordan Powell, 18, and Jack Rouse, 19, attacked a 19-year-old man, who has not been identified, in a flat in Hereford earlier this year.

The pair bound the terrified victim's hands together behind his back before setting his legs and genitals on fire with the flamethrower. 

Jordan Powell, 18 (left), and Jack Rouse, 19 (right) have been jailed for three-and-a-half years after they set fire to a man's genitals and legs with a home-made flamethrower during an overnight attack in Hereford 

They had made the home-made flamethrower using an aerosol can and cigarette lighter and had been at a party with the man, before going back to Rouse's flat - where the attack took place. 

At a hearing at Worcester Crown Court Powell and Rouse were both jailed for three-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to assault causing grievous bodily harm. 

Their victim was said to be terrified during the attack, and suffered third degree burns to his legs and genital area after the horrific attack which took place at a flat in Hereford overnight on April 11 and 12.

Detective Sergeant Tim Powell, of West Mercia Police, said: 'This is a particularly nasty attack and the sentencing has brought these two violent offenders to justice.

Both teenagers were jailed for three-and-a-half years at a hearing at Worcester Crown Court

'They conducted this horrific assault with intent to injure and terrorise the victim. I hope this result indicates West Mercia Police's priority of protecting people from harm.'

Both men also received a further 18-month prison sentence after admitting a robbery of a 17-year-old man in Hereford on April 12. Police said their victim suffered 'significant facial injuries' as a result of the attack. 

The sentences will run concurrently.
