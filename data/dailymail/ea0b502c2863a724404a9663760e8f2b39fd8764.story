QPR fans may have been treated to a wonderful late equaliser against Stoke City, but there were only 16,000 fans inside Loftus Road to see it - eight fewer than League Two Portsmouth drew to their home game against Wycombe.

With the match broadcast live on BT Sport, and Rangers coming off the back of a 4-0 thrashing against Manchester United last week, the newly promoted club recorded their lowest league attendance of the season.

More fans were at Fratton Park to watch League Two Portsmouth draw with Wycombe than at QPR

Those that did choose to attend were treated to four goals, including a superb free-kick from Niko Kranjcar late on to rescue a point for Harry Redknapp's side.

Three divisions lower Portsmouth drew 16,171 fans to Fratton Park, eight more than had watched QPR in the Premier League.

Johnny Ertl scored his first goal for the club as Andy Awford's side came from behind to draw with high-flying Wycombe Wanderers.
