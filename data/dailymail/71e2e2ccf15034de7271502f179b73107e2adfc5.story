The happy farmer label was drawn by Mr Scheckter's now 19-year-old son when he was four

Supermarkets are being told to stop selling bottles of beer featuring a child’s drawing of a farmer – because alcohol watchdogs fear the label could encourage youngsters to drink it.

The precaution has been slammed as ‘political correctness gone mad’ by the man who makes the beer – 1979 F1 world champion Jody Scheckter.

He is particularly attached to the logo because the smiling farmer is meant to be him, and was drawn with crayons by his son Freddie when he was four. He is now 19 and at Oxford University.

Mr Scheckter, 62, who has been 
producing organic food and drinks at Laverstoke Park Farm in Hampshire 
for ten years, said: ‘I am going to fight this. The decision is 
ridiculous.

‘I can’t 
think of any teenager, even a ten-year-old, who’d think the labels are 
cool. We don’t sell anything to children. I can’t see how anyone in 
their right mind thinks this image encourages under-age drinkers. This 
could cost me a lot of business.’

The
farmer beams from labels on  beef, lamb and chicken, and cartons of 
ice-cream, fudge and apple juice. For five years the character has also 
been used on 170,000 bottles of £1.95 organic ale and lager sold by 
Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Ocado.

But
earlier this year a complaint was made to industry-funded watchdog the 
Portman Group on the basis that the child’s drawing on the label of 
Laverstoke’s alcoholic products was the same image used on its labels 
for apple juice.

Portman says this breaches marketing rules because it could appeal to children.

Portman
Group rulings carry huge weight. High street chains notified that a 
product is in breach of the code have three months to clear the item 
from shelves. If they fail to do so, they may face legal action by 
trading standards and could lose their alcohol trading licences.

A spokesman for the Campaign for Real Ale, which accredits the organic real ale, said: ‘We aren’t aware of any complaints.’
