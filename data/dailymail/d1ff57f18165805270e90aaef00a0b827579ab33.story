Eight children and three adults have drowned after an overloaded kindergarten bus crashed into a pond in China.

The bus, which had only seven seats, was returning the children home through a mountainous village in the southern Hunan province yesterday when it swerved off the road, state media said.

It plunged into the water, killing all 11 people onboard, including two teachers and the driver.

The van was pulled out of the pond early today with the children and a driver inside, according to Xinhua News Agency.

The bodies of the teachers were recovered an hour later.

The school bus is believed to have been travelling on a narrow dirt road with no barrier in Ganzi Village, near the province's capital of Changsha, when it crashed.

One of the victim's fathers told the agency that kindergarten buses in the region are often overloaded.

It is the latest in a series of accidents involving school buses in China, where overcrowding on transport is said to be common.

In April, eight children died after a school minivan crashed on China's southern island province of Hainan.

And two years ago, 19 children died when a makeshift kindergarten bus collided head-on with a truck.

The bus had been converted from a nine-seat freight van, but was carrying 64 people at the time of the accident.

The crash prompted a nationwide outcry about school bus safety in rural China, where there is a shortage of education funds and children are often forced to travel far to get an education because of school closures.

An investigation into the latest incident is currently underway.
