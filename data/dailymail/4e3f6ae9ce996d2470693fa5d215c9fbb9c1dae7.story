The father whose three young daughters perished in a Christmas Day blaze at their mother's Connecticut home has spoken publicly for the first time since their deaths.

Matthew Badger, father to nine-year-old Lily and seven-year-old twins Sarah and Gracie, revealed the grief he continues to suffer - and memories of the last time he ever saw his daughters alive.

'The experience of memories about their lives has been one of tears,' he told Good Morning America. 'And every time I open up my computer and look at pictures of them, I am moved.'

Speaking out: Matthew Badger, whose three daughters were killed in a house fire on Christmas Day, has talked about his grief following their deaths - and how he has channelled it for good

But Mr Badger, who was estranged from the girls' mother, added that he has channelled his grief into something positive, setting up a fund for school arts programs in their names.

The three girls died with their grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, as a fire sparked by fireplace embers tore through their mother's home in Stamford, Connecticut on December 25.

Matthew Badger said he struggled to come to terms with the news: 'It was very difficult to see. Why did this happen? I mean, it doesn't make any sense. And I'd just seen them the day before.'

He recounted the Christmas celebration they had enjoyed in his New York apartment a day earlier.

Legacy: The foundation raises funds for schools to incorporate art - a hobby the girls shared - into classes

'I was with them for an entire week in 
my apartment,' Badger said, smiling. 'It was 
dancing. We had our own Christmas tree. We 
had opened our presents [and] they were all very happy.'

Just hours after the three giggling girls posed for photographs in front of the tree, they left for their mother's home.

That night, with the youngsters concerned Santa Claus would not be able to get down the chimney, embers from the fireplace were put outside. Yet they were still hot and sparked the 5 a.m. blaze.

The girls and their grandparents attempted to escape but were forced back inside. Later reports suggested the home had fire alarms, but they had been disconnected during renovations.

Struggle: Mr Badger, holding an image of Sarah, has created tributes to his girls on the foundation's website

The girls' mother, Madonna Badger, and her boyfriend and the home's contractor, Michael Borcina, managed to escape the $1.7 million waterfront mansion with minor injuries.

Mrs Badger, photographed weeping uncontrollably on the day of her daughters' funerals, reportedly attempted to commit suicide after the deaths. She is now in deep isolated mourning.

Yet Matthew Badger has sought to come to terms with the deaths by creating something positive in his daughters' memories.

He has set up the Lily Sarah Grace Fund to raise money for teachers in public schools to incorporate art into their teaching - a hobby his daughters, who were all dyslexic, loved.

Deadly: The girls died in their mother's Connecticut home, while Madonna Badger and her boyfriend escaped

'It's really hard,' he told Good Morning America. 'People 
treat their grief in different ways. Either they head straight into the 
wind [or] some people hide behind a rock.

'I had a very hard time making sense 
of what life was. The instinct of a father for me was 
that I needed to love my children and that love I channelled into the 
creation of the Lily Sarah Grace Fund.

'I need to try and make them have 
made a mark on the planet, and not have just died in vain.'

Badger said he had been inspired by New York public school teacher Amie Schindel, whom his daughter Gracie loved.

Schindel said: 'I remember having her like it was yesterday. She just kind of shined.'

Badger continued: 'Ultimately, healing will be 
when I walk into a classroom in the fall, and see one of those classes
that is being funded by this monument that I've created for my 
children.

'And if we are able to do that, then 
Lily, Sarah and Grace have done it. They've done it. It's beautiful. 
It's absolutely beautiful.'

The investigation into the fire continues.
