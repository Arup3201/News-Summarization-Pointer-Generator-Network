New details have emerged about questionable recruitment practices at the US Military Academy at West Point, where prospective students were taken by a VIP party bus to a bowling alley, offered drinks and watched as two cheerleaders locked lips.

The school has acknowledged the claims, which were first outlined in a news article published by the Gazette of Colorado Springs Sunday.

Officials at West Point said the academy self-reported the recruitment violations to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, disciplined 20 cadets and reprimanded two officers, along with football coaches, for promoting underage drinking.

Make out session: An internal report has revealed that two West Point academy cheerleaders (not pictured in this file photo) who were aboard a party bus with recruits in January made out with each other 

The superintendent of the academy, Army Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr, released a statement taking full responsibility for the incident.

‘I am fully committed to the values of West Point in all of our cadets and in all of our programs, and will ensure they are upheld to the highest of standards,’ Caslen stated.

The rowdy, alcohol-soaked road trip took place back in January when 14 recruits boarded a party bus along with members of the football team and two cheerleaders, and headed down to the Palisades Mall in New York.

The road-trippers made a pit stop at a bowling alley equipped with a bar, where the prospective students reportedly consumed large quantities of alcohol. 

The cadets allegedly ordered towers of beer for the recruits to drink, mostly paid for by booster money. Some attendees reportedly downed seven drinks in just 90 minutes.

Two military police officers escorted the 'party bus' during the incident. The officers were later reprimanded following an internal investigation.  

On the way back to West Point, the internal report obtained by The Gazette described a 'club-like' atmosphere aboard the party bus, complete with loud music, flashing strobe lights and passengers dancing in the aisle. 

At some point during the ride, two cheerleaders began making out with one another, and also kissed a football player and one of the recruits.

In addition to the boozy trip, the NCAA learned from the internal report that cheerleaders and female cadets had been set up as 'dinner dates' for recruits - a claim that has been disputed by Lt Gen Caslen. 

West Point spokesman Theresa Brinkerhoff said the academy did not publicly detail the incident at the time because it was handled 'administratively', the New York Daily News reported. 

The specific punishments for the officers, players and coaches have not been revealed, but no football players were kicked off the Army team, nor were any suspensions announced.

Ms Brinkerhoff told the NCAA two members of the football staff had been removed from team activities for a week following the misbehavior. 

'I believe those involved in this incident have learned from their mistakes, corrected their behavior accordingly, and will have the character to be the leaders our Nation expects of its West Point graduates,' Caslen said in the statement.

West Point's top officer also took issue with allegations that booster money was used during the raucous outing. 

Caslen insisted that cadet host funds were distributed according to NCAA regulations, but the handling of those funds resulted in NCAA violations.

The Army general added that the 54-seat charter bus used was escorted by a single New York state police officer in compliance with state law and that no military police escort was ever utilized.

Star: The football players involved - which include Army starting quarterback Angel Santiago (above, number 3) - are expected to play against the Air Force Academy at West Point's Michie Stadium on November 1

In a statement, Ms Brinkerhoff, speaking on behalf of the nation's oldest military academy, said that the cadets involved had been dealt with harshly.

She told USA Today: 'Although seen as a minor infraction by the NCAA, the U.S. Military Academy takes this very seriously and adjudicated this at the highest level of the disciplinary code.

'We adjudicated this under Article 10 of the Cadet Disciplinary Code and all cadets appeared before the Commandant's Disciplinary Board.'

The players involved, among them Army starting quarterback Angel Santiago, are expected to play against the Air Force Academy at West Point's Michie Stadium on November 1.
