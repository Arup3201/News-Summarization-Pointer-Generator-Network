A 31-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly shooting dead his girlfriend in a 'rage killing' before hitting out at their neighbors on Facebook for not calling 911 when they 'heard noises'.

Adam Solis reportedly shot 24-year-old  Katie Eager 'more than five times' after they got into a heated argument at their apartment near Cypress Creek Road in Cedar Park, Texas, on Monday night.

He then fled to his parents' San Antonio home, before returning to the couple's apartment Tuesday afternoon, police said. There, he called 911 and told the operator he had found Miss Eager's body.

The following day, Solis took to Facebook to express his apparent sadness over his girlfriend's death - and to criticize neighbors who may have heard gunshots on the night of the slaying for not alerting the police.

Accusatory: On Wednesday, Solis took to Facebook to express his apparent sadness over his girlfriend's death - and to criticize neighbors who may have heard gunshots on the night for not alerting the police

Couple: After the alleged murder, Solis (pictured with Miss Eager) then fled to his parents' San Antonio home, before returning to the couple's apartment on Tuesday afternoon, police said. Once there, he called 911

He wrote: 'I thank everyone for heart felt condolences. I am doing as good as can be expected. Im in San Antonio, with family. I would also like to express how much hate i have for the neighbors who heard but didnt call 911. I dont think ill ever get over the horrifying scene i came home to.

'I love and miss you so terribly baby. You may be lost to me and our friends and families but you will never be forgotten. You are and always will be my one and only light. I love you! (sic).'

But just hours after his Facebook post, Solis was arrested by police on suspicion of murder. He was booked at Bexar County Jail at around 10.30pm Wednesday. His bond has been set at $1million. 

During an interview with police, Solis' statements about his whereabouts at the time of the killing at the Lodge at Lakeline Village apartment complex proved  inconsistent, a spokesman told KVUE.

Officers said it was apparent that Solis wanted his girlfriend, a University of Texas graduate, dead. Miss Eager had reportedly been trying to get away from him when she was shot several times.

Speaking to KTBC, Cedar Park Police Chief Sean Mannix said of the alleged murder at the 2000 block of South Lakeline Boulevard: 'I'd call it a rage killing, there was passion involved in this murder.'  

It is believed that Solis called 911 at around 12.30pm on Tuesday and deliberately lied to the operator - before later uploading a 'misleading' post to his Facebook friends - in a bid to cover his tracks. 

Chf  Mannix said that Solis's Facebook message was likely an expression of surprise that no one living nearby had called the police before he returned to the crime scene on Tuesday afternoon.

On holiday: Several neighbors said they heard 'bangs and yelling' on Monday night - but decided not to call the emergency services after the loud noises suddenly stopped. Above, the couple are pictured together

'He expected there was going to be a police response before he showed back up at the crime scene,' Chf Mannix said, adding that he was also concerned no-one had dialled 911.

Indeed, several neighbors told KVUE that they had heard 'bangs and yelling' on Monday night - but had made the decision not to call the emergency services after the loud noises suddenly stopped.

Noemi Camero, who lives in the apartment above the crime scene, said: 'My daughter heard the man screaming really loud. It died out just as fast. We just came out to the balcony, we didn't see anyone.'

In a statement, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema  paid tribute to Miss Eager, who was an employee at the theater. It said: 'Our thoughts are with Katie's family and friends during this very difficult time.'
