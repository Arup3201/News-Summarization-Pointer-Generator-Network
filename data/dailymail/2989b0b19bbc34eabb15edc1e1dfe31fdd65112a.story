Ice hockey is thought to be a rough and violent sport, but this heart-warming moment involving two Canadian youngsters shows an inspiring display of sportsmanship.

Proud father Mike Zegil captured the moment while his youngest daughter, four-year-old Amara, was on the ice with the Gore Bay tyke hockey team in their home arena at Manitoulin Island, Ontario.

Amara was there to lend a helping hand after a pint-sized opponent fell to the ice and was unable to get back on her skates.

The adorable moment unfolded while Amara’s team went on the attack against the visitors from Manitowaning.

As the players in white jerseys skate up the ice, one of their opponents – three-year-old Arabella – falls at the blue line and is unable to get back up on her own.

That's when Amara skates over to Arabella and extends her glove to help her rival to her feet.

The two – both wearing No 12 – then skate side-by-side as they chase the puck with their teammates. Amara was named her team’s player of the game thanks to her display of sportsmanship.

Mike said: ‘Amara is the smallest player on the team. She is quick to tell you that she is No 12 and actually plays in games, not just practices.

‘Depending on the arena she is playing in, she cannot watch the game because she can't see over the boards.

‘She sometimes has to be lifted onto the ice. But you can hear her cheer from anywhere in any arena.’
