A mentally ill woman who is 23 weeks pregnant has the right to decide for herself if she wants an abortion, a judge ruled yesterday.

The 37-year-old married woman, who suffers from bipolar disorder, wanted a termination but doctors responsible for her care said she was not capable of making such a decision because of her illness.

But yesterday Mr Justice Holman defied the opinions of psychiatrists and the wishes of her mother and husband and said it would be a ‘total affront’  to say she did not have the capacity to make the decision for herself.

Doctors have lost their case against a woman with a 'severe mental disorder' who they wanted to stop having an abortion

The woman - who said she was not 
mentally ill but had suffered a 'nervous breakdown' - told the judge 
that she wanted to divorce her husband and that he was 'completely 
indifferent' when told of her pregnancy.

She said about two months ago she had started to think, 'I don't really want the baby'.

'I have no real support from my 
husband,' she said. 'It would never work. I don't really see a future in
 terms of my relationship with (him).'

Mr Justice Holman said he accepted that she was 'mentally unwell' but he said the question was whether she was 'incapable of making a decision'

She said medication had turned her into a 'zombie' and she was very worried about her ability to care for the child.

'I have no money. I would not be able 
to work. I would be starting in a council flat on my own,' she said. 
'The situation I am in, the idea of me having a baby. I think it is just
 crazy.'

The woman added: 'I would not regret that I got rid of it.'

She said she would try to commit suicide if she was unable to terminate the pregnancy.

'I would seek to kill myself and the 
baby,' she said. 'I have pretty much had enough of the whole situation. 
The only way they could force me to have the pregnancy is by tying me 
down and locking me up.'

Mr Justice Holman heard evidence from 
the woman, a consultant psychiatrist involved in her care, from a lawyer
 representing her husband and from her mother.

The psychiatrist said he was '100 per cent certain' that the woman lacked the capacity to make a decision about termination.

A lawyer representing her husband, who was at the hearing, said he agreed with the psychiatrist's evaluation.

In January this year, a pregnant woman with severe learning difficulties was told she would not be forced to have an abortion after the High Court ruled she had the mental capacity to decide if she wanted the baby.

Doctors applied for an order to allow them to terminate her pregnancy claiming the child was endangering her life.

But the judge ruled the mother must still have the right to decide despite having a 'significant learning impairment'.

The woman, who was not named for legal reasons, was described as being in the 'bottom one per cent of the UK population' in terms of cognitive ability.

Mr Justice Hedley said even if the pregnant woman did not have the capacity to care for the baby, society does.

Her mother also agreed with the psychiatrist and said she feared that her daughter might later regret seeking a termination.

Mr Justice Holman said in most cases 
in the Court of Protection, which is part of the High Court and analyses
 issues involving sick and vulnerable people, the views of psychiatrists
 on mental capacity issues were 'determinative'.

But he said that after hearing evidence from the woman he had reached a different view in this case.

The judge said he accepted that she 
was 'mentally unwell' but he said the question was whether she was 
'incapable of making a decision'.

'There is no doubt she has the capacity to make a decision,' said Mr Justice Holman.

'It would be a total affront to the 
autonomy of this lady to conclude that she lacks capacity to the level 
required to make this decision.'

He said even if some thoughts and 
views on her husband were 'skewed' or 'paranoid or delusional' she had 
given many other reasons for her desire to terminate the pregnancy.

The judge said the woman had said she was unhappy in detention and asked him to imagine being 'unhappy and pregnant'.

'It seems to me to be a perfectly understandable position for detained pregnant mother to take,' he added.

'It has not been established that she lacks capacity to make decisions about terminating the pregnancy.'
