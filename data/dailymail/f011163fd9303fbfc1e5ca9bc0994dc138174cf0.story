Aston Villa have dismissed assistant manager Ian Culverhouse following an investigation that followed his suspension in April.

Former Norwich player Culverhouse, who previously worked alongside Villa manager Paul Lambert at Carrow Road and at Colchester, was suspended in April due to disciplinary issues.

At the time, owner Randy Lerner referred to 'unexpected issues that could have very easily set the club back'.

It is understood Villa have now sacked the 49-year-old, with Lambert now seeking a new assistant manager.

Villa have also sacked head of football operations Gary Karsa, whose career at the club was also put on hold in April after he too faced allegations relating to off-field issues.

Culverhouse and Karsa were the subject of separate internal investigations by the club, with Karsa understood to have been the first of the pair to lose his job earlier this month.

Youth-team coach Gordon Cowans and goalkeeper Shay Given were promoted to assist Lambert and his first-team coaching staff for the closing weeks of the season.
