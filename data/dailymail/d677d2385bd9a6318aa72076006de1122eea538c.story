For all those fascinated by the colourful world beneath the sea, but who can't afford to visit the far reaches of the globe, London's Natural History Museum is here to help.

Beginning March 27, and running through September 13, underwater enthusiasts will be able to get up close and personal with some spectacular seascapes - without ever having to don a wetsuit.

The exhibit, Coral Reefs: Secret Cities of the Sea, will feature a live coral reef, a 360-degree immersive virtual dive experience and specimens of over 200 types of coral, fish and fossils, some of which have never been seen before.

Beginning March 27, London's Natural History Museum will open a new exhibit called Coral Reefs: Secret Cities of the Sea

Coral reefs are primarily found in the shallow waters of the tropics and are home to almost a quarter of all living species in the sea.

But they offer many more benefits than simply being beautiful.

The reefs also home to ample fishing, tourism and even storm protection opportunities, and are estimated to be worth more than £200 billion each year.

Dr Ken Johnson, coral reef researcher at the Natural History Museum, said: 'Coral reefs are not simply beautiful environments. They provide food, income and storm protection for many millions of people around the world.'

The exhibition will feature a live coral reef and hundreds of specimens of animals and fossils

Best of all? Guests will be able to experience a 360-degree immersive virtual dive in the museum's gallery

'The Museum has an exceptional collection of corals from ancient and modern reefs that we have been studying, to understand how these animals, and the diverse habitats they create, have responded to changes in the ocean,' he continued.

'Climate change, pollution and overfishing have had a major effect.

'A quarter of coral reefs around the world are sadly damaged beyond repair and many more are still under serious threat.'

In partnership with Catlin Seaview Survey, stunning  footage has been captured from around the world

Filmed with specially-designed cameras, the images have been stitched together for a panoramic experience

The 'Google Street View' footage from the sea was filmed everywhere from Australia to Indonesia

Thankfully, new technology, like that used by Catlin Seaview Survey, a  project that monitors coral reef health, provides scientists and sea lovers alike with more insight than ever.

Think 'Google Street View' but for the sea, the virtual dive footage will take over the Museum's gallery space for its must-see debut, exploring different reefs around the world.

From Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef to the breathtaking Tubbataha Reef in the Philippines and Komodo Island National Park in Indonesia, the videos were captured by Catlin divers on specially-designed cameras that record images every three to six seconds.

Stitched together, the images create a stunning panoramic view. 

Sound and light effects will also be used to further replicate the feeling of being underwater for visitors.

Sound and light effects will also be used to really help guests feel fully immersed in the undersea views

The museum hopes that the breathtaking exhibit will leave guests feeling 'surprised, amazed and emotional'

Felicity Paynter, the curator of the exhibition, told the Sunday Telegraph that she hoped guests would leave feeling 'surprised, amazed and emotional.'

'I had to think about what visitors might already know, what they don't know and what questions we might be able to answer for them.

'On the one hand, there are lots of very cool, weird and wonderful creatures that live on coral reefs, but there are also some really difficult and abstract concepts.'
