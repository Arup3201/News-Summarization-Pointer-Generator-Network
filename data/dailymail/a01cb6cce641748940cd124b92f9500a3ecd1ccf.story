Luis Suarez is working around the clock to make it back in time to face England says Uruguay club doctor Alberto Pan.

But former Manchester United striker Diego Forlan says he is in perfect shape to stand in if necessary.

'Everything is on course, exactly as we anticipated,' said Pan.

Fighting fit: Luis Suarez is making good progress to be ready to face England, says Uruguay doctor Alberto Pan

Injury: Suarez (centre) had an operation on his knee but has been included in Uruguay's World Cup squad

'He is doing muscle strengthening exercises and feeling no pain.'

Suarez spent his first full day at Uruguay’s World Cup training camp Complejo Celeste in Montevideo on Monday where Pan assessed him.

And Forlan backed his team-mate to return in time but assured Uruguayans concerned about Suarez injury that he will come to the rescue if needs be.

'Japan has been a good experience for me,' said Forlan of who playing in one of the world’s lesser leagues might effect his preparations.

'It’s a good league, the stadiums are good and the football is very quick with several players in my team who are in the Japan team.'

But Forlan believes Suarez will make his date with England.

'He’s in very good spirits,' he said.

Prediction: Veteran striker Diego Forlan expects Suarez to be in the Uruguay line-up to face England

Fresh: But Forlan says he is ready to play after a successful season in Japan if Suarez does not make it

'He is very determined and there is no doubt in his mind but he is also aware that he is still in the phase of recuperation.

'We have a strong group of players and we are happy that he is here with us now.

'He has to take it one step at a time but his determination will help him make it.'

Doctor Pan added: 'The injury is evolving well; he has started to work at the Complejo and he has all the conditions, physical and psychological, to have a correct recovery.

'Until now, all is going according to plan and he will step up the training successively. That will decide when he returns to the team.

'We are confident and we are moving the right way.'

Conspiracy: Suarez had a magnificent season at Liverpool and Pan does not believe he was deliberately injured

Pan also shot down conspiracy theories in Uruguay that Suarez was deliberately crocked in England to give Roy Hodgson’s side an advantage when the two teams meet this month in Sao Paolo. 

'The injury did not necessarily start in England but he did get a knock just before he came to Uruguay,' he said.
