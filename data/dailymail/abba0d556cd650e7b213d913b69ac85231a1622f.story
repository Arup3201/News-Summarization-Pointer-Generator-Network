Boris Becker is the latest person to declare himself less than enamoured with Jim Courier’s on-court, post-match interviews. 

He was displeased that after his charge Novak Djokovic had thrashed Andrey Kuznetsov, Courier asked the top seed about Becker’s fondness for Twitter hashtags. 

‘Don’t understand why #Courier would ask @DjokerNole after a good win @AustralianOpen about my #...wrong place or timing,’ Becker tweeted.

Caroline Wozniacki had a nightmare second-round opponent in Victoria Azarenka, twice champion here but unseeded after missing much of 2014 through injury. 

Azarenka sent the No8 seed packing 6-4, 6-2 in something of a non-upset.

Britain’s Jamie Delgado, who first came to the Australian Open 22 years ago as a junior, is quietly making a decent name for himself as a coach. 

Now 37, Delgado is guiding Luxembourg’s Gilles Muller, who knocked out Spain’s No13 seed Roberto Bautista-Agut in four sets on Thursday. 

Delgado has also been appointed as assistant coach to the Irish Davis Cup team under captain Conor Niland.

Heather Watson recovered sufficiently from the physical problems that wrecked her singles campaign to take her place in the second round of the doubles with Russia’s Alexandra Panova. 

They went through when opponents Annika Beck and Shahar Peer retired in the third set, but for Panova it was scant consolation for missing two match points against Maria Sharapova on Wednesday.

While falling short of last year’s furnace, temperatures rose into the 30s on day four and claimed their first victim in Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. 

The world No36 was trailing Spain’s Feliciano Lopez 0-4 in the fourth set when he retired with heat exhaustion. He was taken to hospital where he spent two hours on a drip.
