Couples who stay together until their children fly the nest can boost their incomes by a third, according to new research. 

The study found husbands and wives could earn thousands of pounds extra- almost the same boost as having a degree- just by sticking with their partner.

Former High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge, the founder of the Marriage Foundation which commissioned the research, claimed it showed that social mobility often depended on people's ability to maintain stable relationships. 

The study found that a woman with a degree in her mid-forties, who married before the birth of her children and has stayed with her partner until they reached 14 or 15 years old would earn around £31,000.  

But if the same mother had separated from the father of her child, her income would drop dramatically to £23,000 a year.

Sir Coleridge told The Sunday Times: 'The better-off on the whole stay together, and so preserve and increase their wealth for the next generation.

'The less well-off, on the other hand, are marrying less and less, staying together less and less, and seeing the perpetuation of their poverty into future generations.' 

Coleridge is now launching a manifesto for political parties to tackle family breakdown, estimated to cost tax payers £47billion a year.

Harry Benson, research director of the Marriage Foundation, claimed that people who stayed together had a greater combined income and therefore more stability. 

The study was created in conjunction with Stephen McKay, a professor in social research at Lincoln University, which analysed data from Understanding Society, a UK study that follows 40,000 households.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that as much as 90 per cent of new parents in the top tax bracket are married- compared to just 50 per cent on minimum wage.

Susanna Abse, chief executive of the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships, said there was evidence that when relationship quality increased, so did financial earnings. 

'It's about parents being able to collaborate on things such as childcare. If you're offered a promotion but have just gone through a relationship breakdown, you will not have the support network, and energy goes out of the career,' she added.
