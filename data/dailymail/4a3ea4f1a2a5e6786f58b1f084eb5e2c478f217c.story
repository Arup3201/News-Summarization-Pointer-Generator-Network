Laura Pelleteri, 45, from New Hampshire allegedly overdosed on heroin in her car while her six-year-old son was in the backseat

A mother has been arrested for allegedly overdosing on heroin in her car while her six-year-old son was left 'neglected' in the backseat.

Laura Pelleteri, 45, from Manchester, New Hampshire, was reportedly spotted passed out inside a parked vehicle at a Walgreens store on Sunday around 3:30pm.

Police say they revived her with an overdose antidote before she was taken to hospital for additional treatment.

Pelleteri apparently told authorities that contact information for the boy's father was on her cellphone, in her purse.

When an officer opened the purse, he said he found two small bags of what appeared to be heroin.

The substance tested positive for the drug, and Pelleteri was arrested on charges of drug possession and endangering the welfare of a child.

The boy was released to the custody of his father. 

It wasn't immediately known if Pelleteri had a lawyer.
