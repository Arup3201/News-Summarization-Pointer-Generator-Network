The leaders of France and Germany sat down with Vladimir Putin today to try and hammer out a peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis, as fears grew that their approach to solving the conflict is threatening Europe's relationship with the U.S.

Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel were pictured seated around a table with the Russian president this afternoon, but no UK or U.S. officials were at the meeting in Moscow. 

Britain's former top Nato commander General Sir Richard Shirreff said the UK should be playing a larger role in the efforts to resolve the crisis amid fears that it could lead to an all-out European war.

The three leaders met to hold crisis talks on the clashes in Ukraine, which have left nearly 5,400 people dead since April last year, but there were no UK or U.S. officials present

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This is the most serious crisis to have faced Europe, arguably, since the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. There is a threat of total war.

'The UK is a major Nato member, it is a major EU member, it is a member of the UN Security Council, and it is unfortunate that the weight that the British Prime Minister could bring to efforts to resolve this crisis appear to be absent.'

Meanwhile U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has warned that America must stand together with Europe to stop escalating Russian military involvement amid reports of transatlantic divisions over whether to send weapons to support the Western-backed Kiev government. 

'We, the U.S. and Europe as a whole, have to stand with Ukraine at this moment,' Biden said. 'Russia cannot be allowed to redraw the map of Europe.'

Biden also accused Putin of riding roughshod over peace efforts.

'Ukraine is fighting for their very survival right now. Russia continues to escalate the conflict by sending mercenaries and tanks and, as we euphemistically say in the United states, little green men, without patches, very sophisticated special operations soldiers.

'President Putin continues to call for new peace plans as his troops roll through the Ukrainian countryside, and he absolutely ignores every agreement his country has signed in the past.'

EU officials said yesterday that the bloc will blacklist more Russian individuals over Ukraine, but divisions within the 28-nation bloc, particularly with the new Greek government, have prevented further broad economic sanctions.

And in an apparent warning to  Merkel and  Hollande as they visit Moscow, EU president Donald Tusk warned against any deal with Moscow that would break up Ukraine.

'We cannot compromise on Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,' he said.

Hollande says all parties pushing for a new peace plan for eastern Ukraine see a cease-fire as the first step but must go further to find a lasting accord.

Hollande spoke today before he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel headed to Moscow to discuss a new European peace plan with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The top-level diplomatic dash came a day after Merkel and Hollande met with the Ukrainian government in Kiev to discuss how to salvage a peace plan agreed upon last year in Minsk, Belarus.

'Everyone is aware that the first step must be the cease-fire, but that it cannot suffice. We must seek a global solution,' Hollande said. 'We should have hope (in this new initiative).'

Fighting between Russian-backed rebels and the government in Kiev has surged in the last month in eastern Ukraine, fueling fears the conflict is threatening Europe's overall security.

Russia has vehemently denied backing the rebels with troops and weapons but the top NATO commander, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, said yesterday that Russia continues to supply the separatists with heavy, state-of-the-art weapons, air defences and fighters.

In Berlin, Merkel said she and Hollande would use 'all our power with direct visits to Kiev and to Moscow today to stop the bloodshed as soon as possible and to fill the Minsk agreement with life'.

She rejected reports that she and Hollande were prepared to offer more territory to the Ukraine separatists, adding: 'I will never deal with territorial questions over another country.'

The diplomatic blitz comes amid fierce fighting which has prompted Washington to consider providing the beleaguered Ukrainian military with lethal weapons, an option that Germany and other European nations reject.

'We are convinced that there's no military solution to this conflict,' Merkel added. 'But we also know that it's completely open whether we will manage to achieve a cease-fire with these talks.

'We don't know if this will happen today or whether further talks are necessary, whether these will be long or short talks in Moscow.'

Merkel told reporters that she and Hollande are traveling in a bid to safeguard 'national self-determination, which is part of the European order'. 

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said he fully supports German and French attempts to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Pictured are Ukrainian soldiers undergoing a training drill
