It has been revealed that the University of South Alabama campus police officer who fatally shot a naked student was carrying pepper spray and a baton at the time

University spokesman Keith Ayers admitted yesterday that Officer Trevis Austin, was armed with all three weapons when he walked outside the police station with his gun drawn to confront Gil Collar.

The shooting of the 18-year-old college freshman who was naked when he banged on police department windows in the early hours of last Saturday caused national outrage because of the perceived use of excessive force.

It's unclear why Austin, a four-year employee in his first police job  went for his gun first, but the decision was defended by the campus police as the right course of action.

Authorities said that Collar, a 5-foot-7, 140-pound high school wrestler in his first semester of college, was on LSD when he moved aggressively toward the officer in an athletic stance, prompting the shooting.

But surveillance video shows the student never tried to grab the officer's weapon or got within 4 or 5 feet of Austin.

A copy of the university's weapons policy, released to The Associated Press in response to an open records request, shows an officer's actions in cases where force is necessary should be based on how much a suspect resists.

Deadly force is justified only when a suspect has the intent, ability and opportunity to kill or injure someone else, the policy states.

The policy says that an officer's attempt to control a situation 'should match (the) level of resistance then move up or down as resistance changes.'

But Ayers declined comment on how the guidelines are interpreted when an officer is confronted by someone who doesn't have a weapon, yet could present a threat.

'The university is withholding further comment at this time as the district attorney and sheriff's office have time to conduct a thorough external review,' he said.

An attorney for Collar's family, former Alabama Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, said the university's policy 'totally gives support to our position' that the shooting wasn't justified.

'There is no question the required force here was much less than shooting somebody,' he said. 'He could not say his life was in jeopardy or he was in fear of bodily harm.'

Probe: Austin, an officer for four years, has been placed on leave while an investigation continues

Authorities have said a grand jury would review the shooting to determine whether charges should be filed. Such investigations are typical in police shootings in Alabama.

Mobile County Sheriff Sam Cochran has said it was unclear whether the officer could have done anything other than shoot Collar because he walked outside with his gun drawn.

'Had the officer had a Taser or some other less lethal instrument, I do not know if that officer would have had an opportunity to ... holster his pistol and to use something else because the events were evolving so rapidly and he was so close that had he put the pistol in the holster, I don't know that he could have drawn something else,' Cochran told reporters earlier this week.

Cochran said he believed it was proper for the officer to go outside with his gun drawn after Collar repeatedly banged on windows at the campus police station, but he hasn't said whether he thought the shooting was justified.

Authorities haven't said why Austin drew his gun first rather than opting for a less-lethal weapon.

Video of the fatal shooting of a 
naked Alabama college student shows him with his arms outstretched and 
his palms open seconds before a campus police officer fired.

The
 Mobile County Sheriff's Department played the approximately two-minute 
security video for media Thursday. It was taken by a surveillance camera
 outside the University of South Alabama police station, where 
18-year-old Gil Collar was fatally shot early Saturday morning. The 
video has no sound.

Police 
said Collar, 18, had taken the drug LSD and was acting aggressively, but
 an attorney for Collar's family said the video shows his actions didn't
 justify the shooting. Authorities declined to release a copy of the 
video.

On the tape, Collar walks slowly 
toward a campus police station door once and then walks away. Seconds 
later, he walks back to the station and pounds violently on a glass 
window.

He then walks away from the police 
station again before an officer, Trevis Austin, comes out with his gun 
drawn and pointed at the naked student. Collar approaches Austin with 
his arms outstretched and palms open toward Austin.

They move around the porch, with 
Collar kneeling at one point, then getting to his feet and again walking
toward Austin. The officer keeps backing away from Collar, his gun 
pointed at the student, as Collar approaches.

The two move into the yard, where the
view of the camera is partially blocked by the porch columns and 
lighting. Less than 30 seconds after Austin came out of the building, 
the video shows Collar falling after having been shot.

The former high school wrestler was struck once in the chest.

The police dispatcher can be seen 
opening the station's front door in response to the sound of gunfire. A 
second officer arrives just as Collar is being shot. Collar gets up 
twice and the officers pursue him.

Sheriff Sam Cochran said two officers
handcuffed Collar to subdue him after he was shot, but that could not 
be clearly seen on the video. A second backup officer arrived just as 
the two-minute video ended.

‘In my opinion it was proper to come out with the gun,’ Cochran said.

He said numerous police officers have
been killed with their own weapons and that it is important for an 
officer to make sure a suspect isn't able to take control of a weapon. 
Collar did not touch Austin, but Austin got as close as five feet to the
pointed gun before Austin fired.

The 18-year-old allegedly took LSD at an outdoor music festival before assaulting two people in vehicles and trying to bite a woman's arm.

The University of South Alabama freshman then went to the campus police headquarters, 
where he was allegedly shot by Austin.

The video shows the five-foot-seven, 
140-pound student never got closer to the officer than four feet and 
didn't try to grab his weapon, Beasley contended. The lawyer said the 
video also shows the officer didn't wait for backup to arrive before 
coming out of the station.

‘I have seen nothing to indicate to 
me that you ought to go out there with a raised gun against a guy who's 
buck naked, unarmed and in distress,’ he said.

Beasley said the officer was not 
carrying a baton or pepper spray, even though university officials have 
said officers typically carry both in addition to a gun.

Forensic scientists have not completed a toxicology report on drug use, he added.

‘The fact that he came to the police 
station indicates that he was not necessarily looking for trouble. In 
fact, I think he was looking for help,’ Beasley said.

Collar managed to get up even after being shot once in the chest, and backup officers arrived seconds after the shooting.

Beasley
 said there was nothing to justify the shooting on the surveillance 
video, which was shown to both the media and representatives of 
Beasley's law firm but has not been released publicly.

Collar's funeral is scheduled for Saturday in his hometown of Wetumpka, located about 20 miles north of Montgomery.
