Officers have been told to respect the ‘culture and history’ of anyone caught chewing khat, as a ban on the drug came into force at midnight.

From today, the herbal stimulant, grown in Africa and popular among the Somali community in the UK, is an illegal Class C drug. But police have been told to issue only a slap on the wrist ‘Khat Warning’ for a first offence, then a £60 fine.

Only if they were caught using khat on a third occasion would a person face arrest and a court hearing, according to guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).

Illegal: Khat, a herbal stimulant, grown in Africa and popular among the Somali community in the UK, is an illegal Class C drug from tonight

The guidelines are for dealing with people possessing khat for personal use.

The ACPO policy stated: ‘It is important that officers… retain their operational discretion; taking into account that khat has historically not been a controlled drug and was part of the culture for certain communities linked to the Horn of Africa.’ 

About 2,560 tons of khat was imported in 2011-12 with a value of £13.8million.

It is usually chewed in family homes, at community parties or at legal khat cafes for up to six hours at a time. 

No third time lucky: Police have been told to issue only warning for a first offence, then a £60 fine, with offenders only facing arrest on a third occasion

But security experts have warned that proceeds from selling the drug, are believed to be fuelling Islamist extremist groups, such as al-Shabab.

Home Secretary Theresa May overruled her own drug advisers to ban khat saying that if she failed to act Britain would become a transit route for illegally shipping it into mainland Europe.

Chief Constable Andy Bliss, of ACPO, said: ‘Enforcement of the khat ban will be firm but proportionate. 

Officers will take into account the nature of the offence and its severity, using a tiered approach towards offences relating to possession for personal use.’

Khat is a leafy green plant containing two main stimulants which speed up your mind and body. Their main effects are similar to, but less powerful than, amphetamines such as speed.

Khat is most common in communities on Africa’s Horn, but it is becoming more common in Europe.

The key effects and risks of khat include alertness, happiness and becoming more talkative.

The drug also suppresses appetite and can cause insomnia.

There is also evidence that khat can make pre-existing mental health problems worse and cause paranoid and psychotic reactions.
