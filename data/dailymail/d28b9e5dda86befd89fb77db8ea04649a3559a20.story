Comedian Josh Richards wasn't joking around when he said he wanted to spend his 40th birthday  party in space.

The Australian, who is now 28, is already planning the occasion with 23 strangers when he hopes to touch down on Mars in 2024.

It is a long-shot, he said, but his chances are more than a pipe dream now with the West Australian pushing his claims for a place on the hotly-contested Mars One expedition which will see just 24 people travel to space and never return.

Josh Richards is hoping to celebrate his 40th and first birthday on Mars as part of the Dutch-funded 2024 Mars One mission

Korum Ellis, Richards friend, is also in line for project which could see the pair endure a 10-year training regime

The West Australian, and friend Korum Ellis, are two of 705 people in the running for the mission  that will see space goers undergo a 10-year training regime in order to prepare for the rest of their lives in space.

It will teach them all the necessary skills to start a new colony that will produce its own oxygen, water and food.

Ellis said it will require up to nine years of unwavering dedication to prepare for the trip, while Richards said he is leaving no stone unturned in his quest to join the team of 24.

The 28-year-old left his long-term partner, a budding career in comedy and a former life as a soldier all behind to fulfill his quest.

He told Daily Mail Australia he has high-hopes of making his first birthday on Mars one to remember.

'I've already figured out the 40th Birthday Idea,' he said.

'I worked out that if I'm 28 now, ill be 29 by mid-August ... and if they are planning on launching September 24, 2013 I would have just had my 39th birthday.'

If all goes well it will be his last on earth.

He said the journey will take seven months, and by the time he touches down in April 2024, he'll have just five months to wait to pop the party streamers.

Comedian Josh Richards has had a life long dream to travel to space since he was seven

He and Mr Ellis were two of more than 200,000 people who applied for the Mars One project in 2012 - but that number has since decreased due to stringent medical tests and preliminary interviews.

In the coming months more people will be rejected, and the hopes of those left on the list increased until six-teams of 24 people start their training.

Just one team of 24 will travel - meaning those who gave up their careers to toil for a spot on the Mars One mission will be left high and dry back on earth.

Training will start next year, and Richards' background as a soldier working in the British and Australian Army will hopefully help his bid.

'People aren't just being picked for existing skills and ability but also to see how everyone gets along with other people.'

'I will relocate where ever they need me, which will be both Europe and US requiring a fair bit of travel.

The team will spend three months in isolation and once fully prepared will be trained to the 'same level as a paramedic.'

'In some cases the same level as surgeons,' Richards said.

More than 200,000 people applied for project, hoping to be one of four chosen to make the first mission in 2024
