Love triangle: Tearful roomate Rosita Cotto speaks to Mail Online after she was turned back when she tried to visit Cecil Williams. She says a love rival is preventing her seeing the newly-famous blind man Williams

The blind man who survived falling onto a subway track and being run over by a train after his guide dog tried to save him is at the centre of an emotional love triangle, MailOnline can reveal.

Cecil Williams has a girlfriend called Cynthia who is caring for him by his hospital bedside - and a former lover who wants him as well.

Both women will no doubt be aware that he has to date received $109,000 from well-wishers after an online campaign was launched to let him keep Orlando, his seeing eye dog.

Former girlfriend Rosita Cotto tried to visit Cecil in hospital today but burst into tears when apparently told by Cynthia that she could not see him.

Rosita lashed out at her love rival and branded her a 'booty call' who has her own 'agenda'.

She told MailOnline that Cynthia, who has not revealed her second name: 'She's not good for him!'

Her outburst came as Cecil, 60, continues to recover in hospital after he survived falling onto the tracks at 125th St in Harlem, New York, on Tuesday when he became dizzy.

His 11-year-old black Labrador, Orlando, who had tried to hold him up, fell with him and just as a train was approaching the station woke him by licking his face.

Clutching his dog, the blind man flattened himself in the space between the rails as the train moved into the station. The lead car passed over them, as terrified witnesses screamed for the train to stop.

The two managed to duck at the last minute and survived.

Rosita arrived at St Luke's Hospital in Manhattan today at 6am in the hopes of seeing Cecil.

Christmas miracle: Cecil Williams was saved by his dog Orlando after the pair fell onto subway tracks and were run over by a train. Well wishers have donated $39,000 so Cecil can afford to keep Orlando once he retires

Lies: Cecil's current girlfriend Cynthia, pictured, dismissed Rosita's claims and said the fact that she was caring for him 'was all that mattered'

But around 10.30am things came to a 
head when Cynthia came down to the reception area and informed her she 
would not be allowed in.

Rosita
 spent five minutes on the phone talking to Cecil during which time she 
was visibly distressed and could be overheard saying 'this is 
unacceptable!'

She then stormed out in tears and showed MailOnline documents which she claimed gave her the right to see him.

Rosita
 told MailOnline that she and Cecil lived together for five years in the
 Rockaways in Queens and The Bronx but lost touch during Superstorm 
Sandy last November.

She said that Cecil then moved into a YMCA in Queens which is where she met Cynthia.

Rosita said: 'I feel a sense of responsibility towards him because I cared for him for so long. I'm going to miss him.

'If you talk to Cecil tell him I want him to recover 100 per cent and I love him.'

Rosita denied that they had dated - Cynthia says otherwise - but went quiet said that 'I'm just very loyal to him'.

War of words: Ms Cotto says the girlfriend staying with Mr Williams is a 'booty call' who has been doing drugs  when not caring for the blind man

As for Cynthia, Rosita had nothing but harsh words.

She said: ‘She's not good for him. She's no good. She's HIV positive, she doesn't care about anything. She won't allow me in.'

After
 being turned away at the hospital reception, Rosita called Cecil on his
 mobile phone and he told her that he had a high fever and a headache.

During their conversation she could be overheard saying 'this is unacceptable!'

Rosita said: 'I prayed for this man every day loyally. He has a son, Daniel Thompson, who has three babies he has to care for.'

She
 added that Cecil was living in a 'little crunched up apartment a studio
 with the dog (Orlando), with the dog in a tiny apartment with roaches 
and she doesn't care.'

Rosita said: 'Cynthia is a booty call and that's all she is!' 

Retiring: Mr Williams has found himself at the centre of attention from the two women after well-wishers donated $39,000 so he could afford to keep aging service dog Orlando after he retires

At an emotional press conference earlier in the week at St. Luke's Hospital a teary Cecil thanked strangers nationwide for their kindness saying, 'Orlando, he is my best buddy, he's my pal. The spirit of giving, Christmas, it exists here and it's in New York.'

As
 Cynthia left the hospital for a cigarette and a walk, she told 
MailOnline that she was not bothered by what Rosita was saying.

She
 said: ‘It’s OK, I don’t care. I don’t want to get into all of that. I 
don’t care what Rosita has to say. I’m here and Rosita isn’t.

‘Please don’t ask me any questions. It’s not my decision to let her up, it’s his (Cecils’). I’m looking out for him’.

At least as far as Orlando goes, Cecil's life is not quite so dramatic.

He
 thought that he would lose his companion of eight years but donations 
totaling $109,000 have flooded in since it was revealed his insurance 
wouldn't pay for the 10-year-old dog to stay with him when he retires.

Hospital a teary Cecil thanked strangers nationwide for their kindness 
saying, 'Orlando, he is my best buddy, he's my pal. The spirit of 
giving, Christmas, it exists here and it's in New York.'

He said: 'I feel that it's a blessing, I feel that it's a miracle.

'All the people that contributed or donated, we should take our hat off to them. There's still good people in this world.

'I appreciate that people got together and helped me to keep Orlando. It is going to to cover him for the rest of his life.

Loyal companions: Cecil and Orlando have been together for ten years but the dog will soon have to retire

Cecil raised a smile when he noted that Orlando will deserve his retirement.

'He’s a senior citizen -- he’s got grey hair,' he explained. 'He’s looking forward to enjoying life now.'

'For me, I know that angels, miracles, that’s what saved me down on the track.'

Guiding
 Eyes for the Blind, the guide dog school that trained Orlando, said 
they have been fielding hundreds of inquiries about whether Cecil will 
be forced to give Orlando up for adoption in January when he retires 
from his job and loses his current insurance plan.

'We
 recognize everyone's concern about Orlando's future - whether he stays 
with Cecil or goes back to the loving home of his puppy raiser, please 
know he will be honored like the hero he is,' the group said in a 
statement.

The incident that landed Cecil in hospital left witnesses fearing he and Orlando had died.

Horrified
 commuters watched as an employee of the MTA shouted down to Cecil as he
 sat upright on the tracks and said not to move and to lie down in the 
trench between the tracks.

The train driver slammed its breaks on and then rolled two carts over Orlando and Cecil.

Incredibly Cecil suffered a gash to his head - presumably from the fall.

FDNY
 Capt. Danny O’Sullivan, a 17-year FDNY veteran told the New York Daily 
News someone must have been watching out for Williams and Orlando. 'We 
checked out under the train and found that he was not trapped; he was 
just in between the rails' 'It must have been a lucky day for him. This 
definitely is a miracle.'
