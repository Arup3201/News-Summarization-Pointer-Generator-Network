The widow of Chris Kyle's sniper colleague has hit out at the Oscar-nominated film 'American Sniper', claiming it portrays her late husband as a coward who 'questioned America's mission in Iraq'.

Marc Lee, whose shooting death in the then-battle-torn city of Ramadi is graphically depicted in the $264million box-office sensation, was deployed abroad with the Navy SEALS  in April 2006.

Over the next four months, he served alongside his Charlie Platoon 'brothers', including Kyle, who is played by Bradley Cooper and whose death aged 38 at a US rifle range is not featured in the movie.

However, on August 2, 2006, Lee was shot dead in a gunfight after stepping into the line of fire to protect his teammates  - an action that saw him posthumously awarded two separate honors. 

Now, his widow, Maya Elbaum has criticized 'American Sniper's' portrayal of her husband's service in Iraq, saying it 'deeply sacrificed' his 'truths and beliefs', as well as his selfless, but 'strong' character.

Right, his widow, Miss Elbaum , said 'American Sniper' 'deeply sacrificed' her husband's 'truths and beliefs'

In an article for Fox News, Ms Elbaum, who met Lee in Coronado, California in 2001, and married him in 2002, wrote: 'The character of Marc Lee falls short on everything that the real Marc Lee stood for and what Chris Kyle expresses about his brother and teammate in his book, which inspired the film.'

She continued: 'The movie portrays Marc as a reluctant warrior - one who seems casual in combat - who questions America's mission in Iraq. Nothing could be further from the truth. In contrast to the movie, Marc was a fierce fighter who believed he was making a difference in Iraq.'

Ms Elbaum, whose final memories of Lee are of him boarding the US Air Force's C17 aircraft with Charlie Platoon in 2006, said her husband truly 'believed in the war with his whole heart'.

This belief stemmed not only from Lee's desire to serve for his beloved country, America, but also to 'protect innocent Iraqis who lived in constant fear of terrorists', she wrote in the article.

As a 'Team Guy', Lee would do anything for his 'SEAL brothers', she said. These included Kyle, whose autobiography inspired the blockbuster hit, which was has been nominated for six Oscars. 

In action: In an article for Fox News , Ms Elbaum, who met Lee (pictured, front, in action with the EALS) in Coronado, California in 2001, and married him in 2002, wrote: 'The character of Marc Lee falls short on everything that the real Marc Lee stood for and what Chris Kyle expresses about his brother and teammate'

Teammates: Lee (pictured, left, in his Army attire) worked alongside Kyle (right) in Iraq in 2006. The latter was shot dead at the age of 38 by former Marine Eddie Ray Routh at a rifle range in Stephenville, Texas, in 2013

Indeed, the sniper's willingness to make 'the ultimate sacrifice for his country' saw him receive the Silver Star and the Purple Heart posthumously. He was also granted the Bronze Star for his service.

While Ms Elbaum said Lee's initial desire to become a pastor before joining the SEALS was depicted accurately in the film, she wrote his reason for choosing the latter career was wrongly portrayed.

She described the remarks by actor Lee Grimes (who plays Lee in the film) that he decided to join the SEALS because he was a 'gambling man' as 'bizarre' and not reflective of her husband's drive.   

She also revealed that the final letter Lee wrote before he shot dead was 'severely edited' by film executives, giving it a different, 'false' meaning that implied he died after giving up on his mission.

'Chris Kyle's character says: "The war didn't kill Marc, his letter did" - a confusing reference to those who knew Marc because it seems to suggest Marc gave up on the mission, and that led to his death,' she said, adding that her husband remained a devout Christian until he died, while she is Jewish.

Revelations: Miss Elbaum (pictured during her recent interview) also revealed that the final letter Lee wrote before he shot dead was 'severely edited' by film executives, giving it a different, 'absolutely false' meaning

However, she emphasized that she is 'truly happy' for 'American Sniper's' success - and does not want her comments about her husband's film portrayal to deter from the story of Kyle's achievements.

Ms Elbaum has now released the final letter that her husband wrote two weeks before his death in a bid to portray his true character. His words were later included in pamphlets at his funeral service.

In his final letter before his death, Marc Lee, the first Navy SEAL to die in the Iraq War, wrote:'I have seen war. I have seen death, the sorrow that encompasses your entire being as a man breathes his last I can only pray and hope that none of you will ever have to experience some of these things I have seen and felt here.'

He finished: 'To all my family and friends, do me a favor and pass on the kindness, the love, the precious gift of human life to each other... Love Ya, Marc Lee.'

In the  letter, Lee,  the first Navy SEAL to die in the Iraq War, wrote: 'I have seen war. I have seen death, the sorrow that encompasses your entire being as a man breathes his last.

'I can only pray and hope that none of you will ever have to experience some of these things I have seen and felt here.' 

He signed off the document: 'To all my family and friends, do me a favor and pass on the kindness, the love, the precious gift of human life to each other... Love Ya, Marc Lee.'

Lee's death came seven years before Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, were shot dead at a rifle range in Stephenville, Texas, alongside by former Marine Eddie Ray Routh, 27, in 2013.

Earlier this month, it was revealed that a final scene of 'American Sniper' showing Kyle's gory death at the range was cut after his wife urged screenwriters to leave it out for the sake of their young children. 

The late father-of-two's widow, Taya, pleaded with director Clint Eastwood and other execs not to include the horrific moment in the film, so it was omitted, screenwriter Jason Hall revealed. 

'We talked about doing it but... five days after Chris was murdered, [Mrs Kyle] called and said, "This is going to be how my children remember their father, so I want you to get right",' Mr Hall said. 

Latest development: It comes as a psychologist has reportedly testified in court that Eddie Ray Routh (pictured in court on Friday) has been faking schizophrenia and knew his actions at the range were wrong

Killed: 'American Sniper', which has become a blockbuster hit, is based on Kyle's (pictured) autobiography 

He added that Mrs Kyle's request had especially affected him as a father. 

'I didn't want this movie hanging over [the kids'] heads for the rest of their lives as the film that showed their father getting shot,' the screenwriter told the New York Daily News.  

Routh is currently on trial for shooting dead Kyle and Littlefield at the rifle range. There is no doubt that he was responsible for shooting the sniper, who has the most kills to his name in U.S. histor 

The former soldier has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At the end of the trial, jurors must decide whether or not he intentionally committed the murders and knew his actions were wrong. 

It comes as a psychologist has reportedly testified in court that Routh, who claims he had PTSD at the time of the killings, has been faking schizophrenia and knew that his actions were wrong.

On Friday, psychologist Randall Price testified for the prosecution, a day after a forensic psychiatrist for the defense told the jury that he found Routh had paranoid schizophrenia and showed signs of psychosis that could not be faked.

According to The Dallas Morning News, Price contested: '[Routh] did know what he was doing was wrong, and he did it anyway.'

Price testified Routh does not meet the state's legal definition of insanity but has a paranoid personality disorder made worse by his heavy drug use, the reports said.

Closing arguments in the case are expected as early as Monday. Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence without the possibility of parole.
