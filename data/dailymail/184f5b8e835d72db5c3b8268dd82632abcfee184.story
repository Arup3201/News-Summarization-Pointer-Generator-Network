Pumped-up: Motorists are losing out on £1.5million a day as a result of wholesale savings not being passed on, the AA said

Diesel car drivers are being hit by inflated prices to line the pockets of fuel suppliers and petrol stations, according to a new study.

Across the UK, motorists are losing out on almost £1.5million every day because of increased margins which do not pass on lower diesel wholesale prices, researchers found.

According to the AA, the ten million drivers of diesel vehicles pay around 3p per litre more than they would if the savings were passed on.

The study found that the average price for a litre of diesel is 5.32p higher than that of petrol - despite the fact that diesel bought wholesale is only 0.8p more expensive.

A monthly fuel price report revealed that the average UK price for a litre of petrol is 130.47p, and for diesel it is 135.70p.

Other countries in Europe have passed on the savings, leaving French, German and Spanish drivers paying proportionately less than Britons.

In France diesel is actually cheaper than petrol by 0.4 per cent, while in Spain it is 2 per cent more expensive and in Germany 7 per cent.

The average figure for UK forecourts is 11 per cent.

The motoring organisation also pointed out that the higher prices are keeping prices in the shops high, as many haulage and delivery firms are passing on higher transport prices to their customers.

Analysis of average prices by the AA said that the differences allowed UK sellers to make much higher profits from diesel drivers.

It suggests that over the past three months suppliers and retailers make 8.2p profit for every litre of diesel sold, compared to 4.98p on petrol.

Edmung King, the AA's president, said: 'The pumped-up price of diesel so far this summer is hitting 35 per cent of UK car owners and is inexcusable. Neighbouring European countries have passed on the benefit of lower diesel wholesale costs to their drivers.'
