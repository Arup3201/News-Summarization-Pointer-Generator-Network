The mother of Sophie Lancaster, a woman murdered in 2007 because of her Gothic looks, has said her OBE is a 'validation' for all those young people targeted for looking or dressing differently.

Sylvia Lancaster, who founded the Sophie Lancaster Foundation in her daughter’s memory, was honoured by the Prince of Wales earlier today for her work in stamping out hate crimes.

'He talked about Sophie, actually, and about gang culture,' a delighted Mrs Lancaster said after the ceremony.

Tragic: Sophie Lancaster was just 20 when she was beaten to death by a gang of teenagers 

'I’m sure she would be proud. To be here, and we can talk about it, can’t we? - You’re here in Buckingham Palace - it’s very special ... 

'It’s not just about the work that we do, it’s a validation of the work that we do and of the alternative subcultures as well.'

Mrs Lancaster said she was touched that Prince Charles knew about her 20-year-old daughter's tragic death in 2007.

Miss Lancaster was with her boyfriend Rob Maltby, 21, when she was set upon by drunk teenagers in a park in Bacup, Lancashire.

The gang turned on her and Mr Maltby, who survived the attack, because of their alternative appearance.

Horrifically, Miss Lancaster was kicked and stamped on while she knelt on the ground, cradling the injured Mr Maltby.

Both fell into comas but Miss Lancaster, a gap-year student, never regained consciousness and died in hospital 13 days later.

Goths are not often seen at Buckingham Palace, but Mrs Lancaster wanted to add a touch of her late daughter’s style for her audience with the Prince.

'I’ve got a velvet bag with a skull on it and that’s because it represents the subcultures, and I wanted to bring them with me,' said Mrs Lancaster, who also sported black and silver nail polish.

'That’s my thing. And my funky nails. When I was younger I was always quite different, but I really never had the balls to dress like that. But I like the touches.'

Heartbreaking: Although Sophie died, her boyfriend Rob Maltby, 21, did survive the appalling attack

She said she hoped her charity, which aims to challenge prejudices towards people from alternative subcultures and campaigns on hate crime legislation, would offer troubled youngsters hope.

'We got a letter, probably last week, from a dad whose daughter was being bullied in school - the kids had even given her razor blades,' Mrs Lancaster said.

'Her dad was saying "Thankfully there’s someone we can talk to, and you have made it easier" - that there is somebody who’ll listen.'

Mrs Lancaster also revealed that she has stayed in touch with Mr Maltby, who has spent the years since the attack rebuilding his life.

'Rob should be allowed to get on with his own life,' she said. 'Thankfully he is doing that.'
