Disgruntled: Landlord Donald Zucker, 83, took a tree vendor to court for selling trees before December 1

It seems the Christmas cheer isn't here quite yet.

A real estate mogul has taken a Christmas tree vendor to court for selling trees on the sidewalk outside his Manhattan building before December 1.

Landlord Donald Zucker, 83, griped that Evergreen Stand started selling trees outside his building on 15th Street and Sixth Avenue on November 24 - hogging parking spots and clogging up foot traffic.

But when the Wisconsin-based company did not take down its stand, Zucker took them to court to enforce a city code that prohibits the sale of trees before December 1.

'Unless the Evergreen Stand is immediately stopped, defendants will continue to mount Christmas trees on the stand, making removal of the trees extremely difficult,' he said in the suit, which was reported in the New York Post.

Zucker, who lives on Long Island, did not return a request for comment but Zucker's attorney said his client brought the suit after complaints from residents in the building at 77 West 15th Street.

He added that the Christmas tree company needs the landlord's permission to sell its wares in front of his building.

The suit was withdrawn on Wednesday because the owners of the stand could not be tracked down to defend their business, but the landlord vowed to fight them again next year, the Post reported.

Zucker, who has multiple properties across Long Island and in Midtown according to records, served in advisory positions under New York City Mayors Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani.

The code he referenced states that Christmas trees must only be sold on the streets from December 1. It arose in 1938, when then-mayor Fiorello La Guardia demanded street vendors have a license.

Many were immigrants and the paperwork was often impossible to get through.

But when members of the public complained that they could not buy Christmas trees on the streets anymore, the City Council passed a law - the 'coniferous tree' exception.

The case was eventually thrown out because the vendor of the stand (file pictured) could not be found

It says 'storekeepers and peddlers may sell and display coniferous trees during the month of December' on a city sidewalk without a permit.

The only issue for Evergreen Stand is that the code states that vendor must also get the permission of the owners fronting the sidewalk - in this case the landlord - and keep a walkway open for pedestrians.

But the lawsuit was thrown out after the vendors could not be located

Zucker was hoping to enforce a city rule that prohibits the sale of trees without a license before December 1

Even after December 1, vendors must get permission from nearby buildings
