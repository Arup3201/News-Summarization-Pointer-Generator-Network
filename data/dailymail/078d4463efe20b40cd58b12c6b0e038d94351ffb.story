NHS hospitals are recruiting Spanish and Portuguese nurses in record numbers while British applicants are being refused because places on training courses have been slashed  to cut costs.

Managers are spending tens of thousands of pounds employing foreign recruitment agencies to find the nurses – who do not have to be checked to ensure they can speak English.

Bosses say there are not enough British-trained nurses  to meet demand, even though nursing has never been a more popular career choice.

More than 5,000 student nurse places – which cost the NHS £70,000 each – have been axed since the General Election.

In 2007, just 75 nurses from Spain and Portugal registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council to work here. In 2012, that had risen 14-fold to 1,060.

Last night the Royal College of Nursing said hospital managers had cut student nurse places too hard and too fast. Chief executive Peter Carter said: ‘To save money, they’ve shut off the supply of nurses. It’s so short-sighted.’

Since 2009, one in four nursing training places in England has vanished. They have dropped by 5,325, from 23,121 to 17,796 in 2013. Yet 200,000 people apply to study nursing annually.

Rise: In five years the number of nurses from Spain and Portugal registered to work here rose from 75 to 1,060

The NHS’s ‘yo-yo recruitment’ was ‘stacking up problems for the future’, Dr Carter said. ‘Unless we get a grip on this now, the problem with lack of nurses is going to get worse and we are going to have to go to all points of the compass to fill places.’

And while nurses from  non-EU countries have to undergo strict language tests,  an EU directive means the  NHS cannot insist on English checks for those from Europe.

Health Minister Anna Soubry said there was ‘no shortage of nurse training places’.

She added: ‘Nurses from abroad make a very valuable contribution. But their clinical skills are no help to patients unless their language skills are up to scratch.

‘Employers must make sure that their staff have the right language skills to do the job.’
