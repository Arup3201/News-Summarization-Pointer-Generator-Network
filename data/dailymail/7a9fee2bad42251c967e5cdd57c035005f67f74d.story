Security staff are also on strike at Stuttgart and Hanover airports throughout the day.

One eyewitness who was caught up in the mayhem at Hamburg Airport told MailOnline Travel: 'The queue was across the terminals hall, and then snaked down a side passage to the security area.

'Although I've hanged my flight and am now in a hotel in the city centre, I'd say easily 5,000 people are still standing in a queue trying to get through security.'

Stuttgart airport said on its website passengers should expect waiting times of between one-and-a-half to two hours for security checks, while the smaller Hanover airport said there were no delays.
