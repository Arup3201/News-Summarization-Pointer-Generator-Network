TV actor and comedian Paul Shane, best known for his role as Ted Bovis on hit sitcom Hi-De-Hi, has died aged 72.

The star of the classic 1980s comedy passed away surrounded by family members at a hospice in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, yesterday after a short illness.

Shane rose to fame playing holiday camp host Ted Bovis in the programme which ran between 1980 and 1988.

He then took the part of Alf Stokes in You Rang, M’Lord? alongside some of his Hi-de-Hi! co-stars.

Linda Kremer, his agent of 15 years, said: ‘He lightened my life and I’ll miss him enormously. Paul Shane was a consummate  professional, a true gentleman, a good friend, and a joy to work with over the past 15 years.

‘He didn’t suffer fools, always maintained his sense of humour,  and never stinted on the time he gave to his fans.’

People took to Twitter following the announcement of his death to share their favourite memories of the actor, with many posting links to a video of his enthusiastic rendition of You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling on Channel 4 in 1996.

Comedian Ricky Gervais wrote: 'RIP Paul Shane. Old school Britcom hero. This one’s for you mate...'.

Sitcom Hi-De-hi ran for eight years and made stars of its cast in the 1980s. Pictured left to right are actors Ruth Madoc, Simon Cadell, Paul Shane and Jeffrey Holland

Born in 1940, as George Frederick 
Speight in Thrybergh, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, he achieved fame 
late in life, after first working as a miner in Yorkshire.

An accident down the mine aged 27 saw
him pensioned off, and he became an entertainer in the pub and clubs 
around south Yorkshire.

A
small role in a 1979 episode of Coronation Street as Frank Roper was to
be the starting point for more than a decade on the TV screens of the 
UK.

Comedy writer Jimmy
Perry spotted Shane in the soap opera, and cast him in the role of 
scheming Ted Bovis in his new holiday-camp sitcom Hi-de-Hi!.

The series ran from 1980 until 1988, and won a BAFTA for Best Comedy Series in 1984. It was based on Perry's experiences working as a Redcoat in Butlins.

In 2004 the show was voted 40th in a list of Britain's Best Sitcom.

The episodes saw Shane's character, Ted Bovis, involved in a series of scams to con the campers out of money.

Bovis also spent his time terrorising timid campsite boss Jeffrey Fairbrother, played by Simon Cadell.

When Perry and co-writer David Croft, who also wrote Dad's Army and It Ain't Half Hot Mum, wrote their next show, You Rang, M'Lord?, they cast Shane to play Alf Stokes.

Later recurring roles Shane enjoyed on TV included a stint on Emmerdale (left) as Solomon Dingle, and BBC's Holby City (right) as Stan Ashleigh

The show, which looked at life upstairs and downstairs of a aristocratic family in the 1920s, ran from 1990 to 1993, with Shane, a keen singer, also employed to sing the theme tune.

Between 1995 and 1997, Shane played Jack Skinner in two series of Oh, Doctor Beeching!.  He then spent his time performing in theatres, including performances in pantomimes.

He didn't disappear off TV screens altogether however, and enjoyed recurring roles in television series Holby City (11 episodes in all) and Emmerdale, where he played Solomon Dingle for 8 episodes.

In May 2009, he underwent a life-saving heart operation at Sheffield Northern General Hospital and made a full recovery.

Before the operation he is reported as saying: ‘If I didn’t have this operation I could be dead in 12 months — or I could last ten years. You don’t know but I’m not taking that risk.’

He leaves behind three daughters and six grandchildren - his wife Dorrie died of kidney failure at the age of 58 in 2001.

Shane was reunited with Hi-De-Hi co-star Su Pollard in BBC's Oh Doctor Beeching
