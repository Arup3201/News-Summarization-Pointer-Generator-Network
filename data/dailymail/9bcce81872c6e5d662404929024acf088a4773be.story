Rahman told The Sun: 'I have not been able to talk to my brother about this because he is sick.

'He doesn't speak too well now but he's proud we're here for him. He's given this his blessing.'

Muhammad's daughter Maryum said: 'He has not seen the film yet but he is going to love it.

'He will be very proud. He is a fighter.'
