Friends and family of tragic skydivers Michael Vaughan and Alana Clarke have flocked to their social media pages to pay tribute to the pair, who died in a freak accident on Friday. 

Mr Vaughan, aged in his 40s, had spent more than 24 hours hospitalised in a critical condition after the accident. His family and friends  spent the day by his side in a Gold Coast hospital, hoping and praying for him to pull through.

He died after his family made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support. 

News of his death came after the identity of the woman who died when their parachutes tangled mid-air was confirmed as Briony 'Alana' Clarke.

'It's a tough time for our family's & friends but it was nice to be in the air.

Tragedy struck when the 29-year-old woman and Michael Vaughan attempted a mid-air manoeuvre on Friday afternoon.

This left Mr Vaughan in a critical condition while NSW Police confirmed on Saturday that Ms Clarke died at the scene. 

Mr Vaughan was taken to hospital and has reportedly survived surgery overnight, according to the Australian Parachute Federation.

Mr Vaughan's Facebook page was early filled with words of encouragement and photos shared by loved ones worldwide.

One friend from the US wrote: 'Vaughny, we ALL need you! Please, fight!'

Family and friends of Michael Vaughan have taken to social media to wish him well in his recovery as he remains in a critical condition after a skydiving accident near Sydney on Friday afternoon

'Pull through this Vaughany. You are loved by so many my friend,' another friend posted on Facebook. 

The Australian Parachute Federation issued a statement earlier on Saturday, saying Mr Vaughan 'is in critical condition but has survived the night and is undergoing some more tests'.

'The families of both Kate [believed to be Mr Vaughan's partner] and Michael thank you for your support and messages and are grateful for your prayers,' the statement reads. 

Mr Vaughan, who is believed to be a champion of the sport, has made more than 10,000 jumps in his career, and is considered one of Australia's best 'canopy pilots'. 

According to an advertisement posted online, Mr Vaughan held a training course from March 20 to 27. An flier for the event posted by Mr Vaughan read: 'work on your landings or come fly with me.... Or BOTH!!!'

Mr Vaughan also shared a group photo of members who were part of his landings course a day before the accident.

Among those tagged in the photo was Alana Clarke, who wore a blue jumpsuit.

Details emerged that Friday was slated to be a 'flying', course in which participants learnt manoeuvres such as in-flight stalls and high-performance landings. 

Varying reports have emerged of what happened in the air, but investigators from the Australian Parachute Foundation (APF) now believe the pair collided and became entangled during a dive that required them to fly close together.

The trouble started below 3000 feet after the parachutes opened, according to investigators who visited the site on Saturday.

Entangled, the pair spiralled towards the Tyagarah farmland, near Byron Bay, and hit the ground about 3.30pm.

Police believe the accident was caused when the parachutes of the skydivers became tangled during the jump

APF safety and training manager Richard McCooey says there is usually a procedure to use a reserve parachute in the event of a mid-air tangle.

Investigations will focus on why that option wasn't used.

The South Queensland Parachute Council released an update on Mr Vaughan's condition on Friday night on its Facebook page.

'At the hospital with Michael's family,' the post read. 'He is in surgery for the last two hours and will be there for a few more. His injuries are very severe and we do not know if they are survivable.

Please keep praying for him. He has already survived more than they expected him to so that is something.' 

Another post said the 'entire skydiving nation (is holding) its collective breath'. 

The pair had been training together at Skydive Byron Bay, according to the AAP. 

They landed heavily at an airstrip off the Pacific Highway in Tyagarah, after the jump around 3:30pm on Friday afternoon.

'A group of people jumped. Two of those people's parachutes opened normally but close to each other and they collided after their parachutes opened,' McCooey said, according tothe Daily Telegraph.

It is believed the duo was training together when the accident occurred 

'Their parachutes collided, and then what tends to happen is their parachutes become tangled.

'That upsets the normal descent rate of the parachute and they descend faster than they are meant to ... they have impacted the ground very hard.'

The pair was treated at the scene by paramedics, however the woman, who has not been formally identified, died.

The man has been flown to Gold Coast hospital in a critical condition.

'It's not a common activity within skydiving,' CEO of Skydive the Beach Anthony Boucaut told AAP.

'The canopies dock on each other, they touch each other's parachutes.

'(The moves are) part of an internationally recognised competition.' 

While police investigate the death and the man fights for his life, Mr Boucaut said the crash would reverberate throughout the skydiving community.

'It's a horrific incident, with two highly skilled people,' he told AAP.

Michael Vaughan is a champion of the sport and had made more than 10,000 jumps in her career before Friday's tragic accident

Mr Vaughan is considered one of Australia's best 'canopy pilots' and trained other skydivers

Mr Vaughan held a training course from March 20 to 27. A post advertising the event from Mr Vaughan read: 'work on your landings or come fly with me.... Or BOTH!!!'

'The gentleman involved in the incident is a world and Australian champion.

'He's regarded highly in the community.' 

Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman Peter Gibson said the Australian Parachute Foundation would be responsible for investigating the tragedy, with a report to be handed to CASA for review.

'They take carriage of it but we certainly review it all and make any decisions about whether any ations are needed,' he said.

Meanwhile, another parachuting accident has left a man in a serious condition in Victoria on Saturday morning.

He hit his head and suffered pelvic and leg injuries after a 'rapid descent' and 'hard landing' at Barwon Heads on Saturday, Ambulance Victoria says.

The man, who is yet to be identified, was airlifted to the Alfred Hospital in a serious but stable condition.
