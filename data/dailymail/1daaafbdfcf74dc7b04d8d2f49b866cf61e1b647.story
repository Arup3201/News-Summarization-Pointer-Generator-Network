An unemployed artist found himself in literally in the doghouse after he fell on hard times and decided to move into a kennel.

After being forced out of his rented home last year, Jamie Curtis, 46, camped in a farmer’s field in Silsden, West Yorkshire, before moving into a derelict kennel on the land.

When his tent disintegrated, he made the 12ft-by-15ft hut habitable by kitting it out with a carpet, bed and solar-heated shower. 

Creature comforts: Jamie Curtis, 46, moved into the kennel three months ago, after living in a tent when he was forced out of his rented home last year

Minimalist: Mr Curtis was offered the derelict 12ft by 15ft kennel by a sympathetic farmer three months ago, after his tent began to leak

Mr Curtis has been living in the kennel - complete with dog run - for three months, and has made it a home fit for a King Charles Spaniel.

Mr Curtis said: 'It’s got pros and cons. I’m happy with it, but it is a bit lonely.

'It’s mostly quiet, but every time I’ve rented a house before there have been problems with neighbours with noise and that from the stereo.

'If I had the choice between a quiet house and living in a kennel, I would have to pick the house, but this will do me for now.'

Back to nature: The kennel has two dog runs but no kitchen, so Mr Curtis usually eats pre-cooked or tinned food

Sprucing the place up: The unemployed artist has modernised his simple home by fitting a bed, carpet and a solar-heated shower

Few mod-cons: The little Yorkshire hut has a portable toilet outside but no electricity

Mr Curtis has not worked for more than two years and admits to being the ‘black sheep’ of his family, with no relatives who could help him out.

He lived in a number of rented properties and bedsits in recent years before becoming homeless.

Toughing it out: Mr Curtis has been jobless for two years but is trying to save up his dole money to buy a home

Once his tent started to leak, sympathetic local farmer Gordon Waite said he could use the old hut.

Mr Curtis said: 'I initially camped on his land, but bad weather ruined it, so I moved into the kennel.

'There’s no alarm on it or anything like that, but I’m not saying I have any valuables, but you do worry about people coming in.

'It’s two kennels with dog runs that have not been used for ages. My single bed takes up a quarter of it.

'It’s not a doss hole or anything like that - I have carpets.'

The kennel does not have a kitchen but Jamie mostly eats pre-cooked or tinned food.

He has hooked up a shower and uses a portable toilet at the rear of the kennel.

'I’ve got a solar-heated shower,' he explained. 'It’s a bag you hang in the sunshine and the sun warms it up.

'I shower every day. I’ve just got to fix a leak at the moment.

'The biggest problem is that I don’t have electricity. I might have to get a generator.'

But Mr Curtis hopes his days in the dog house will be short-lived as he is saving up his Jobseekers’ allowance to pay for a deposit on a flat.

He said: 'I don’t have any bills where I’m living, so I’ve been able to save up.

'I’m hoping to buy somewhere someday. Apart from the bit of money I have saved up, I’m not exactly rich.'
