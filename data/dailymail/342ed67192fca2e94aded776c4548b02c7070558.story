BMW's auto-park function has made life a lot more difficult for one Florida man after he says it malfunctioned and sent his car crashing into another vehicle.Jonathon Libratore, 27, told police he was trying to park his 2013 BMW in the Target parking lot in Stuart using the Park Assistant function when the car swiftly accelerated across a grassy island into - and onto - a car parked opposite.Â 

Libratore's infant son was in the back seat of his BMW but was fortunately unharmed in the accident.

Needing assistance: Both cars had to be towed after Jonathon Libratore's BMW crashed into a parked car

The crash happened just after 5pm Tuesday.

According to ABC News, both cars had to be towed from the scene.

BMW's Park Assistant function helps drivers find parking spaces of the right size and 'actively supports the driver during parking, taking care of gear selection, steering, accelerating and braking.'

BMW has defended the parking function, saying it's designed to help drivers with parallel parking but does not control the speed of the car.

'The system does not control the speed of the vehicle at any time,' BMW North America spokesman David Buchko told ABC News.

'The driver controls the speed of the vehicle with the accelerator and the brake.'

Marin County Sheriff's Office posted pictures of the dramatic crash to its website, where commentators questioned Libratore's story, suggested that the driver accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake.

Marin County deputies are investigating the cause of the crash.
