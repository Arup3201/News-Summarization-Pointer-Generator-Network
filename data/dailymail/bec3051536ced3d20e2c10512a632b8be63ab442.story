When Liverpool fans bemoaned last season’s title collapse, they did so with the heavy burden of recent history on their shoulders.

They will have seen their captain, Steven Gerrard, fight for the championship in those closing weeks as if it were his last shot at the only domestic glory which has eluded him.

And when it slipped from his grasp in those final few games, they will have feared a repeat of what followed on the last two occasions Liverpool finished second in the league.

Brendan Rodgers will want to avoid a Liverpool Premier League slump after last season's second-placed finish

In 2001-02, the Merseysiders finished runners up to Arsenal and three points clear of fiercest rivals Manchester United in third. 

Despite losing manager Gerard Houllier’s services for several months due to the Frenchman’s heart surgery, it had all looked so promising.

The Reds rallied in the last three months of the campaign, minus striker Robbie Fowler, who had been sold to Leeds United in the November. Optimism was in abundance.

But during that summer, Houllier turned down the opportunity to sign enigmatic compatriot Nicolas Anelka, instead buying the wholly ineffective Senegalese El Hadji Diouf. What followed was abject misery.

Instead of pushing on and challenging for the number one spot, form deserted the Anfield side and their disappointing fifth-place finish even killed off the consolation of Champions League qualification.

To make matters worse, Liverpool crawled home a massive 19 points behind Man United - a 22-point swing in fortunes between the rivals from either end of the East Lancs Road.

It would be another six years before Liverpool again stove for the dizzy heights of the Premier League summit.

The 2008-09 campaign was widely considered the best under Spanish manager Rafa Benitez, even though he had clinched Champions League glory with that famous fightback in Istanbul in 2005.

Liverpool finished with a club-record Premier League haul of 86 points. They may have trailed Sir Alex Ferguson and United by four points in the final reckoning, but Liverpool had been top in April and Anfield was again filled with promise for the season ahead.

The implosion, however, was spectacular. Just 12 months later, a team which had threatened so much under Benitez was languishing seventh in the table.

It was their lowest finish in 11 years and Liverpool could not crawl beyond the fourth round of either domestic competition.

And after working so hard the season before to qualify to be among Europe’s elite, they did not even progress to the knock-out stage of the Champions League.

At the end of that season, the club announced they had terminated Benitez’s contract and so began the farce that was Roy Hodgson’s doomed reign.

In the decade before Hodgson strolled through the door at Anfield, there had been moments of majesty. The Champions League victory in 2005, in particular, brought back memories of Liverpool’s glorious past.

But, something was missing; there was no league title. And for a club built on their dominance of the domestic scene, it was a bitter pill to swallow. The pain looks likely to continue.

Liverpool have struggled for creativity since the departure of last season's 31-goal top scorer Luis Suarez

Many predicted trouble for Liverpool after Luis Suarez, last season’s 31-goal top scorer, wiped away his tears, packed his bags and strode off into the sunset for a new life at Barcelona.

Perhaps, though, nobody expected it to be quite this bad. After finishing just two points away from winning the league last season, Liverpool have won just two of their opening five matches.

And the drama of Tuesday night’s record-breaking penalty shootout success over Middlesbrough will fool nobody. Brendan Rodgers’ side were pushed to exhaustion by a Championship outfit.

In the modern age, whenever a club fails to secure success expected of them, then finance - or lack of it - is usually thrown up as the excuse.

Liverpool detest comparisons with United, but the Old Trafford outfit are often the perfect example.

While Liverpool’s title challenges only ever seemed to last one season, United have come close one year only to then to march to the title the following season.

United finished second in 1995, 1998, 2006, 2010 and 2012 but lifted the Premier League trophy each following May.

The key to United’s resurgence has been their willingness to invest and reinvent each time they have looked like losing their way. Failure has been the breeding ground for subsequent success.

Nobody can accuse Rodgers of refusing to spend in the wake of Suarez’s departure to Barca for £75m.

He splashed out more than £100m on nine players in the summer, but there has been a glaring absence of pay-back for that investment.

Mario Balotelli, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren have all failed to shine while Liverpool have again struggled in defence and shown a glaring lack of creativity in front of goal.

Perhaps as well as the burden of history, Liverpool’s players feel the weight of expectation.

After 25 years without the title by the time this season ends, the clamour for success grows ever greater with each passing season. It was a millstone which similarly hung around United’s throats until Ferguson smashed it to pieces in 1992.

It was the arrival of Eric Cantona in the December of that season which eventually inspired United to run away with the title with an astonishing 10-point margin.

Maybe when the transfer window reopens, Rodgers will have located the marquee signing to replace Suarez and finally banish those Anfield demons.
