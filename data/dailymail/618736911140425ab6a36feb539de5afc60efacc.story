As a city, Jerusalem only experiences a major snowstorm every few years.

So it's no wonder these monks decided to take advantage of the unusual weather when a snow flurry hit the Holy City. 

These six brothers were filmed taking part in a huge snowball fight on a rooftop in the middle of Jerusalem, after inches of snow fell during the unexpected blizzard.

These six monks took advantage of an unusual snowstorm in Jerusalem by having a snowball fight 

One of the brothers initiated the good-natured  fight on a rooftop in the middle of the Holy City

Soon, all six berobed monks were taking part in the mayhem, laughing as they hurl the snow at one another 

The good-natured snowball fight was filmed by Hector Gonzalo Collipal Osses, who posted the footage on Facebook with the caption Los hermanos en la nieve, meaning brothers in the snow.

The video shows snow falling around the berobed monks, before one tentatively leans down and grabs a generous scoop of the snow.

He then heaves it at the back of one of his fellow brothers, before a second monk decides to form his own snowball. 

Soon, all six monks are taking part in the mayhem, laughing as they hurl the snow across the rooftop.

Although average winter temperatures can be chilly, it is unusual for the city to see such heavy snow in the winter.
