A major search is underway for a missing 30-year-old woman who vanished from her home without shoes, money or a phone nearly two weeks ago.

Kayelyn Louder, nicknamed 'Kiki', was last seen on a surveillance video leaving her condo in Murray, Utah, in torrential rain at around 7pm on September 27.

At the time, she was wearing a white tank top and shorts but no shoes, her family said. She had also left behind her purse, phone, house keys, car keys, and beloved pet dog, Phyllis.

Police were first alerted to Ms Louder's disappearance on Wednesday after her roommate realised she had not seen or heard from her for a while.

'She left with just herself ... and it was pouring rain,' Ms Louder's father, Jesse, told KSL.com.

Her mother, Suzie, added: 'Something weird is going on. It's just not normal behavior. We're just trying to do our best to try to find her and hope she is okay.'

Mr Louder said his daughter did not have a history of abnormal behavior, but admitted she had 'a little bit of depression' due to her recent employment status.

Since Ms Louder vanished from her home, her sister Madi Rodriguez, has been hanging up hundreds of missing person posters  in a bid to locate her,.

'The only thing we can think is she ran out to maybe meet somebody or ran to another person’s condo,' she told Fox 13: '

'But when she would leave she would be gone for maybe an hour a or so and she would be very anxious to get back to her dog.'

Concern: Mr Louder said his daughter (pictured) did not have a history of abnormal behavior, but had 'a little bit of depression' due to her recent employment status. 'She's been in and out of jobs for the last year,' he said
