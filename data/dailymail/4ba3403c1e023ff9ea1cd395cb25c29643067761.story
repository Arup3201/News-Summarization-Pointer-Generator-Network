The average home in the North East now costs less than £100,000 – just a tenth of the price of a typical home in London’s most exclusive borough.

Land Registry research released yesterday highlights the extreme variations in house prices across England and Wales.

In London’s most exclusive area, the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the average home now costs more than £1million.

£1,050,000: A 49 sq.m. one-bedroom flat on Ovington Square in Kensington, London will set you back over one million pounds

£99,950: It may not be Kensington, but this three-bedroom property in Thorntree, Middlesbrough, boasts a large garden and kitchen - all for under £100,000

But in the North East, the average home costs £98,304 – less than 10 per cent of that price.

Homes in the North East have lost 
around a quarter of their value since October 2007, when the average was
around £130,000, including a 3 per cent dip over the past year.

So stark is the divide that the 
increase in the value of a home in Kensington and Chelsea in the past 12
months is larger than the average value of an entire home in the North 
East. Over the past year, properties in that part of London have risen 
by 12 per cent.

The average home there now costs a staggering £1.06million.

And a nearby one car garage has an asking price of £250,000

The cheapest English city is Hull, 
where the average home costs £68,247. However, properties in more 
affluent parts of the Yorkshire and Humber region raise its average.

Across London, house prices are rising
– up by 10 per cent or more in boroughs such as  Camden, Westminster, 
Hammersmith and  Fulham, and Islington.

Gabby Adler, an independent buying 
agent, said: ‘In the capital, competition for the most desirable homes 
is very hot indeed with properties achieving above the asking price.’ At
present, a 582sq ft one-bedroom flat in Kensington is on the market for
£1million on the Rightmove website. A nearby one-car garage has an 
asking price of £250,000.

For the same money in Elwick, Hartlepool, £1million would buy 12 stables, barns, summer houses, three, four-car garages and views of the rolling countryside

The sprawling estate has an open summerhouse with veranda, Japanese style garden and large pond, well stocked with Koi

By comparison, a ten-bedroom home in 
Elwick, Hartlepool, on the market for £1million includes 12 stables, 
barns, summer houses and three four-car garages.

Overall, the Land Registry figures 
show average prices have fallen in the North East, North West, South 
West, West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber and Wales over the past 
year.

They have risen in the South East, London and the East, and have remained unchanged in the East Midlands.

The average price of a home in England and Wales is £161,490.

The cheapest place in Wales to buy a home is Blaenau Gwent where you can buy for just £67,581.

This year, experts predict house prices will fall or stagnate in most parts of the country.

A three bedroom terraced house for sale in Kenton, Newcastle Upon Tyne such as this can be expected to fetch £95,000.

According to the agent's description it features generous accommodation with a southerly facing garden.

It is described on the Zoopla website 
as: 'Immaculate three bedroom end terrace town house situated in this 
popular residential area offering generous accommodation throughout.

'Briefly comprising over three floors; entrance hall, lounge, dining kitchen, three bedrooms and a family bathroom.

'Externally there is a garden to the rear and an integral garage'

This three bedroom Grade II Listed house in Clearwater Terrace, Kensington, has a first floor drawing room, and a ground floor kitchen/dining room and will set you back £1m.

It has three bedrooms and does not have a garage.

But is close to transport links of High Street Kensington (District and Circle line) as well as shops and restaurants.

The RightMove website describes it as: 'excellent accommodation with a wonderful first floor drawing room, a ground floor kitchen/dining room providing further entertaining space and rooms on the lower ground floor allow for flexible family living.'

This three-bedroom house may not be a stone's throw from Harrods but with a pricetag of less than £100,000 it is a downside many recession-hit home-buyers would be able to overlook.

The semi-detatched home up for sale in Middlesbrough is not only a great deal cheaper than a tiny London pad it also boasts a garden - complete with a cabin - a large kitchen and an electric fire in the sitting room.

Although the Thorntree estate in east Middlesbrough is far from the hustle and bustle of Kensington, for less than a tenth of the price for a one-bedroom flat, it may be reason enough to go north.

Greener pastures: The three-bedroom home's garden even comes with a cabin(rain not included)

Spacious and recession friendly: Despite the price of the house set to less than £100,000 the kitchen can fit the entire family and a good few guests

Budged bedroom: The loft bedroom may have a low ceiling but it's not as low as the price tag

All yours: For less than a tenth of the price of a Kensington one-bedroom flat you can make this master bedroom your own
