Boxing fans in Nottingham came out in force on Monday afternoon to see local hero Carl Froch get put through his paces ahead of his rematch with George Groves.

With less than a week until he faces Groves for a second time, The Cobra looked in peak condition for Saturday's Wembley showdown as he showed off his hand speed and punching power at Broadmarsh shopping centre.

Around 2,000 people took advantage of Bank Holiday Monday to greet Froch, who took time out before his session to meet fans and sign autographs.

The 36-year-old was given a rousing reception before putting his gloves on, not that it surprised him.

Speaking to Sky Sports News after his session, Froch said: 'I've got a big following here. I've been boxing in Nottingham for years. I can feel the love I'm getting.'

After beating Groves via a 
controversial stoppage in November last year, Froch has vowed to win 
this weekend's bout in more convincing style.

He said: 'I know what to expect now. I know what tactics George Groves brings. He tries to 
wind his opponent up. He was successful the first time but I don't 
listen to him now.

'I'll use this platform to show everybody how good I am. All I need to do is concentrate. I've beaten tough, strong, world class athletes. Roll on Saturday, I can't wait.'

Asked what fans who aren't familiar with his style could expect to see on Saturday, Froch added: 'Stick me on YouTube and have a look at me. That'll be the Carl Froch that turns up. The brutal warrior will be there on May 31st.

Confident: Froch has vowed to knock out George Groves at Wembley on Saturday

'Groves can say what he wants. This fight won't last the distance. I made his face look like a Panda the last time we met. This time it's going to be more brutal.

'He cannot go the distance with me. I'm winning by KO or TKO.'

Around 80,000 will fill Wembley for Froch-Groves II and The Cobra has agreed to put on a show for those in attendance and watching at home.

He said: 'The whole country want to watch it. I've put my body through hell for 
three months.

'I'm going to leave everything in the ring - heart, soul, 
blood, sweat and tears if I have to.'
