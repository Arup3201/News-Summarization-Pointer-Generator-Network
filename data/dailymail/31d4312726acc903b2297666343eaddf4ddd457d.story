A bride spent the first night of her marriage locked up in a police cell wearing her bloodied wedding dress after she was arrested for attacking her neighbour.

Newlywed Imogen Hope accused Samantha Pilling of being a white witch who had cursed her family before launching the astonishing attack just hours after her nuptials at Halifax Registry Office.

When the 37-year-old was arrested police asked her if she wanted to change out of her dress, but she refused and spent the night in cells wearing her bloodied bridal gown - while her disappointed groom slept at his parents' house.

Hope returned home drunk from her wedding reception with new husband Keith, 38, just after midnight when she decided to confront Mrs Pilling, who had a long-running dispute with the Hope family, a court was told.

Mrs Pilling was in an upstairs bedroom knitting when Hope shouted up to her.

Hope, who weighs just eight stone and is a slight size six, had downed lager and spirits at her reception at the Shears Inn, in Halifax, West Yorkshire. Her wedding dress was already bloodstained after she broke an acrylic nail when she fell on a cobbled street outside her reception.

She began hurling abuse on her neighbour's doorstep, calling Mrs Pilling - who is a practising pagan - a 'white witch' and accused her of cursing her father-in-law, who lives in the house between two and had recently been diagnosed with cancer.

The husbands of both women - gas board worker Keith Hope and former bouncer Stuart Pilling - also got involved and tussled as as they separated their wives. It was Mr Pilling who eventually called police.

Hope struck at least three blows to Mrs Pilling, causing bruising and scratches to her face and wrist, prosecutor Jane Farrar told magistrates.

Mother-of-three Mrs Pilling is on medication for anxiety and and has suffered an abscess in her jaw, which she believes was triggered by the attack.

According to PC Stephen Young - who was the first officer on the scene at the incident on July 19 this year - Hope was asked if she wanted to change out of her bridal gown when she was arrested.

He said: 'It was suggested to her 
that she get changed out of her wedding dress. That was the initial 
agreement. She then changed her mind and decided to attend the custody 
suite as she was.

'There was a little bit of amazement 
from the lady and quite understandably on her wedding day. Her husband 
was obviously disappointed.'

Mrs Pilling, who moved in next door to Hope's in-laws Christine and Keith five years ago, told Calderdale Magistrates' Court: 'She told me her father-in-law had cancer and it was my fault because I had cursed him.

'I don't deal with curses, I work with crystals.'

She also claimed she had never spoken to Hope before and was shocked at the abuse, in which she called her a 'slag'.

She added: 'Personally I thought it was not the way a bride should behave on her wedding night.'

The student nurse, who trained as a 
paramedic with the British Armed Forces, said: 'I'm not practising as a 
witch at the moment, there's too much negativity in my life.'

She told the court she didn't hit 
Hope because she was not a violent person and could easily have hurt her
because of her Army training, adding: 'I have been trained to kill.'

Hope, a nursery nurse assistant, was bailed after her arrest but was banned from returning to he marital home for two weeks because it was just two doors down from Mrs Pilling.

She told the court: 'I was taken away from my home for two weeks I couldn't see my kids, my husband because of something I hadn't done.'

The court also heard how her husband was devastated when he couldn't spend their first night of matrimony together.

He told magistrates: 'I asked the police "please don't, it's my wedding night".'

The bridegroom ended up spending the evening at his parents' house next door because he couldn't face sleeping in the marital bed alone.

Hope, who claimed she couldn't remember what had happened because she was drunk, denied one charge of assault by beating.

However magistrates found her guilty after the one-day trial. She was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £75 in compensation to Mrs Pilling and court costs of £300.
