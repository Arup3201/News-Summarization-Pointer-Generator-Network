Arsenal missed out on the chance of signing Liverpool sensation Raheem Sterling, admits former academy boss Liam Brady.

The England international, who was a revelation at the 2014 World Cup, was expected to join the Gunners in 2010 before Liverpool made their move.

Brendan Rodgers has since described him as one of the best young players in Europe while his performances towards the end of last season took Liverpool to within two points of the Premier League title.

Brady reveals that Arsenal were close to signing the 19-year-old before he decided against the move.

Speaking to the Irish Examiner, Brady said: 'I think I could have got Raheem Sterling if I'd really gone for him,' Brady told the Irish Examiner. 'But I didn't go through with that one [in the end].'

Liverpool eventually stepped in and paid a £600,000 compensation fee to take the talented winger to Anfield. 

After being in and out of the team last season, Sterling is now regarded as a regular starter with high expectations placed on him ahead of this season where the Reds will be hoping to challenge at home and in the Champions League.
