Yup, you could say that determined former model Jodie Kidd has put her heart and soul into trying to win tonight's Celebrity MasterChef Final.

'Oh my God!' she shrieks when she thinks about it. 'I went for it. I pushed myself so out of my comfort zone that I was out of control. And then, after two hours of cooking, I collapsed on the floor from exhaustion. Literally, fell in a heap. '

Jodie, 35, was the underdog in the show from the start. As a former waif like model who had not eaten puddings for 15 years, she only started cooking when she had son Indio nearly three years ago.

So she has no doubt about what got her into the final of the most prestigious of all celebrity reality shows.  'It is pure determination that got me to the final,' she says. 'I gave my heart, a hundred million percent.'

That has meant practising dishes in the early hours of the morning - the only time she didn't have to film or be mummy - and then, a few hours later, cooking again in front of the cameras.

'For the first few weeks I was so insecure about the whole thing that I kept thinking to myself, 'oh my God, oh my God, why am I here? What am I doing? But slowly I started to believe in myself. I've never worked so hard but it has been the most incredible experience I have ever been through.'

After the sad despatch of little perfectionist Wayne Sleep last night, the 20 original contestants have now been whittled down to three.

Along with determined and competitive Jodie is her polar opposite - quiet but assured actress Sophie Thompson. And the final member of the trio to make it to the end is big meaty cooker, Alpha Male television presenter Charley Boorman.

'I didn't think I would ever get to the final but I dared to hope,' says Sophie, 52, little sister of Emma Thompson.

'It feels really special to have got this far and to have had the chance to work with so many brilliant and different people.'

She says she entered because she thought it might be an adventure. And it has; all of the finalists describe it as a rollercoaster. 

'One night as we watched the show years ago  one of my sons said to me, 'Ma, you should try this and I said something along the lines of, 'don't be ridiculous' only I was probably not that polite.

But somewhere in my head a wee thought piped up and whispered; actually perhaps I would like to try that.

'I feel so lucky to have been able to do it; to meet and work with such wonderful, funny, generous people. But while I knew it would be a challenge, I don't think I realised just how much of a challenge it would be.'

Charley, 47, known for his thrill-seeking adventure programmes says being on the show has given him as much as of an adrenalin rush as any of his 'more stupid' - and dangerous - acts. 

'Some of the challenges were brilliant fun,' he says. 'It has been a real emotional rollercoaster; from the week when I was too wildly ambitious and tried to make a meal from scratch including my own pasta to the joy of coming up with our own dishes at the Olympic park.'

He says he was always quietly confident as a cook - until he started on the show. 'You quickly realise that even if you are a half decent cook your scope of food is actually quite narrow.

'Suddenly you are pushed to do things you have never done before and that's when you realise that you are not as good as you thought you were. It is a very steep learning curve and you either sink or swim.'

In 
tonight's show the contestants face their toughest challenge yet knowing
 the stakes couldn't be higher. For their first challenge they have to 
cook at top Italian restaurant L'Anima for London's Italian 'cooking 
mafia' Antonio Carluccio, Giorgio Locatelli, Theo Randall and Aldo 
Zilli.

'Cooking
 for some of the top chefs in the land was scary,' admits Charley. 'It 
was a terrifying prospect and slightly unfair. These people are the 
crème de la crème of chefs and they have been cooking all their lives.'

Sophie also admits she found the 
challenge the most difficult yet.  'It was my hardest moment; I never 
felt quite that I understood or connected to what I was making,' she 
says.

Battling it out: Charley Boorman, Jodie Kidd and Sophie Thompson will go head to head in tonight's final

'I became very emotional because everybody was really helping me and wanting me to do better but I was really out of my depth. I was frustrated in myself as I had fallen so short of the excellence that was clearly required.'

Even Jodie, who 'doesn't do blubbing', admits she couldn't help herself from crying like a baby after the challenge.

Once she had picked herself off the floor, that is. 'I had a little blub when [Christopher] Biggins went because he is a good friend but generally I don't cry a lot.

'But in the final, when the chefs were tasting my food, I had a complete meltdown. I had given so much. I had very little left. I was a wreck.'

The final challenge of the series was cooking a three course meal for the show's ever present hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode.

Jodie laughs when I bring up the duo's heart throb status, before adding 'really? They are really considered heart throbs?' But Sophie says she always enjoyed a hug with the duo.

'They are both, I think, so great at what they do and such enthusiasts, which is fantastically attractive,' she admits. 'I found them both very huggable.'

Charley, meanwhile, admits to feeling a bit sorry for them. 'All the food they eat is cold, poor guys,' he says.

'After it is cooked it then has to be photographed and then they have to eat each dish in turn so it is always cold.'

So what now for our MasterChef trio? Since the show finished filming all had a complete break from cooking.

'It was nice to just relax with some Indian takeaways and pizza for a week or so,' says Jodie. 'But now I love cooking and would love to do more of it.'

Charley would quite like to incorporate it into his work as a travelogue presenter. 'And if they wanted to offer me a cookery book for Christmas, well I wouldn't say no,' he adds.

While for Sophie sharing her new found knowledge will be a more private affair. 'It has really opened my head up to really using my kitchen again and celebrating and sharing the staff of life.'
