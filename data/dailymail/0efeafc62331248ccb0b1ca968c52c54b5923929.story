Malky Mackay has been appointed as Wigan Athletic's new manager, despite currently being the subject of an FA investigation into racist, sexist, homophobic and anti-Semitic texts exchanged with his former head of recruitment while at Cardiff City - as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail. 

Latics chairman Dave Whelan admits Mackay has done a 'little wrong' but is adamant he will be good for Wigan going forward, while Mackay says he has 'studied diversity' and has learned from his mistakes. 

Here, Sportsmail takes you through the transcript of Mackay's first press conference as Latics boss, starting with Whelan's comments and moving on to the new Wigan manager's quotes.

Wigan Athletic chairman Whelan said he believes Mackay is 'the man to lead us back to the Premier League'

DAVE WHELAN, WIGAN ATHLETIC CHAIRMAN 

'All the fans in Wigan, they all have total trust in me. Because I have one thing in my heart, that is Wigan Athletic. So they have trust in me and I would say to them all, you can trust me on this one.

'I have investigated every single aspect I can, I think Malky has been so unlucky. He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it.

'But to all fans, I want them to trust me. This gentleman is in my opinion exactly the man we are looking for.

'It is awful when you have to sack a manager, I had a terrible week last week, it hurt me a lot because he (Rosler) is such a nice guy.

'Football is a cruel game, I am sure Malky has found the little thing he did wrong, he has had plenty of stick for it.

'Appointing new managers is not something I enjoy. The last manager had some really good qualities, I rate him. But when Malky applied, he has got a repuation of being a first-class players. Amongst others who applied, they were good lads.

'When I met Malky, it's football, you ask the same questions, you get certain answers. But he came and he was so honest and up front with every question I asked him. And I did ask him questions about the problems he's had on the racist thing.

'Everybody in football knows I am totally and utterly against racism of any description, I have friends all over the world and I have a very good approach to football. For me, football is everything in the world.

'When Malky applied, I interviewed him, impressed with his answers, how he wants the football club to be run. I think he is going to be a brilliant manager for Wigan Athletic.

'While we are a small club, we are still Wigan Athletic. We are from the old fourth division, we have won the cup, we are and always be one, happy club. That will remain

'Malky was absolutely up front (about the texts). He told me the absolute truth, I totally and utterly believed what he said. The first thing he did was to say I did this wrong. We have all done things wrong in our lives. It's not like we are all saints.

'He impressed me immediately because he was so open about it. He apologised for anything he did he knows was wrong. What he did was absolutely private and it was put out in public. He was so honest about it. I took it all on board, accepted it and he deserves another chance to do what he does so well.

'The ongoing investigation, we have spoken to The FA, I don't there is anything in the pipeline. I don't think there is anything really to investigate but that is in the contract, we have to protect the football club. Malky has been warned, he has been open about it all.

'He admits what he did and apologised for what he said. I accept that fully and totally. So I just want to get on with the great game.'

MALKY MACKAY, NEW WIGAN ATHLETIC MANAGER 

'I would ask people to judge me when they see me. I've apologised for my mistakes I've studied diversity and that's something that's ongoing.

'It has been a difficult period and I have made mistakes. I hope that in my time at Wigan, the people of Wigan and the supporters see who I am and see that I'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well.

'I am very proud the chairman has given me the opportunity of managing this club. I can see the pride and passion he has. I want success as a football manager. 

'I am very proud the chairman has given me the opportunity of managing this club. I can see the pride and passion he has. I want success as a football manager.

'I have been without a club for 11 months. It has been tough for me and my family at times. My life is around football and I am very passionate about the game. I was fortunate enough to be at the FA Cup final, it was my boy's Callum first FA Cup final, I took him to Wigan and Manchester City.

'I have been in football for 18 years, I have never had an issue with one of them (players). My door is open, I am close to the players day to day and every one of them will be able to come and chat with me. I have a close knit group period in terms of my last five years track record.

'I made mistakes and I am absolutely not racist. I am taking on an educational programme and that is ongoing. I have apologised for the mistakes.

'The chairman giving me this chance gives me the drive to make sure this club gets back to where it should be.'
