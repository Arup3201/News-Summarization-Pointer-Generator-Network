Her arm thrust out and pouting like a rapper, this is the moment that Michelle Obama showed off her dance moves during a toe-curling appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.

Challenged to show off her dance moves by Ms Degeneres, Mrs Obama gamely obliged and went on to pull shapes that wouldn't have shamed Rita Ora.

Unfortunately for daughters Sasha and Malia, the appearance on Ellen, which airs on the 16th March, isn't the end of the 51-year-old's dancing ambitions. 

Toe-curling: Michelle Obama does her best Rita Ora during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show

Mrs Obama was appearing on the show to mark the fifth anniversary of her 'Let's Move!' initiative, which aims to encourage people to get out and do some exercise.

As part of the campaign, the US First Lady revealed that she - and a party of helpers from So You Think You Can Dance - will be performing a routine to Uptown Funk on the front lawn of the White House during the annual Easter Egg Roll.

This year's event, which will take place on the 6th April, is part of a tradition that dates back to 1878 when President Rutherford B. Hayes opened the White House gardens to local children.

Although egg hunts are no longer part of the event, children are still invited for egg rolling on the lawn and a slap-up afternoon tea.

Practising: According to Mrs Obama, she has been practising the dance routine for more than a year

All smiles: Ms DeGeneres, who says her style is 'street', also joined in with the dance routine

Repeating the trick: Mrs Obama will pull her dancing shoes on again during the annual Easter Egg Roll

America's fashionable first lady looks just as much at ease wearing ball gowns or a pair of pants and comfortable sneakers.

At a recent appearance at the Ellen show,  Michelle Obama paired a 3.1 Phillip Lim white wide leg pants with a black top and cropped jacket. Her outfit choice is obviously comfort driven, as she went on to show off her dance moves dancing to the catchy Uptown Funk song.

Along with the trendy monochrome color palette, the always stylish Mrs Obama also embraced the white hot trend of wide leg pants. After many years of skinny pant dominance, the roomy silhouette is once again back in fashion.

Just in time for the warmer weather, wear them with sneakers like Mrs O or go glam and  pair them with high heels. Either way, these pants will turn heads on the streets.

Among the children to attend this year will be the Obama's daughters Sasha, 14, and Malia, 17, who will have a ringside view as their mother struts her stuff.

Luckily for the teenagers, Mrs Obama revealed during her chat with Ms DeGeneres that she has been practising for the moment for more than a year, hopefully minimising the potential for embarrassment.

Not that the Obamas will be too worried if they are, with President Obama previously telling the Press that should his daughters think of getting a tattoo, he will insist on getting one too.

Most recently, the girls couldn't hide their embarrassment during a Thanksgiving event, the pardoning of the turkey, in which Obama 'pardoned' two turkeys named Mac and Cheese.

Displeased: Most recently, they looked nonplussed as their father cracked jokes during a White House dinner

The press corps laughed along but both Malia and Sasha appeared disinterested as Obama joked: 'Let's face it, if you're a turkey and you're named after a side dish, your chances of escaping Thanksgiving dinner are pretty low!'

Like his wife, the US President has also deployed dance as a means of winding up his daughters, having once told People magazine of his penchant for performing to Gangnam Style.

'They're cooler than I am,' he added. 'There are things I like that they think are cheesy, like Gangnam Style. I love that.'
