Surrounded by her four grown-up children, Jackie Meacock poses for the sort of snapshot seen in countless family photo albums.

They had all just been out for dinner together and enjoyed an evening filled with laughter, jokes and treasured memories.

Yet hours after this picture was taken, Mrs Meacock, her children again by her side, ended her own life in a Dignitas clinic in Switzerland.

The constant pain of dystonia, an incurable nerve condition, meant the 71-year-old grandmother felt life was no longer living.

Recalling their last evening together, her daughter Donella Trickey, 47, said her mother had enjoyed herself so much she had stayed up late and had seconds of her favourite pudding, crème brûlée.

‘It was a lovely night – it was quite an informal meal as that is what we are like as a family, so there were no speeches or anything like that.

‘We all had cocktails, and we laughed and shared stories about ourselves.

‘We even played dare games and Mum was telling us stories. We wanted to keep the mood light.’

The next day, however, that fun-filled night seemed a lifetime ago.

Mrs Trickey, from Brighton, her sisters Caron Gill, 53, and Nina Sloper, 51, and their brother David Sloper, 44, accompanied their mother on the short journey from their hotel in Zurich to the Dignitas clinic on September 13 last year.

‘Mum held my hand so tightly,’ Mrs Trickey recalled.

‘Nobody said a word all the way to the clinic. We just sat in silence. There was part of me still thinking “this isn’t happening”. It was hard to come to terms with the fact we were going to leave her there.’ 

Her mother, however, was thinking of more immediate matters.

‘Mum went into practical mode,’ Mrs Trickey said. ‘She started taking all her rings off and gave them to us. She gave me her wedding ring.

‘She checked who was going to take her purse and who was going to take her shoes. It was difficult. Mum came with a bag full of stuff, and she wasn’t coming home.’

Mrs Meacock, a grandmother of nine and great-grandmother of six, paid £10,000 for an assisted suicide and cremation package at Dignitas.

She made the decision after her struggle to cope with her condition became too much and she tried unsuccessfully to take her own life.

That resulted in her being taken to hospital and sectioned as mentally ill. But her daughter insisted: ‘Mum didn’t have mental health issues. She wanted to die with dignity. And she got her final wish.’

Mrs Meacock’s family meant everything to her, and she’d tried to hide the pain for more than a decade.

‘She was very outgoing, very family-oriented and she worked all her life,’ her daughter said. She said her mother had been a security manager who spent 25 years ‘chasing shoplifters’.

At home she was ‘always there with lots of hugs’.

Despite her sunny nature, the agony of dystonia, which made her body twist and muscles go into spasm, left her life a misery.

‘It was relentless. She was exhausted with it. Her face was etched with pain. Over the last few years it got worse.

‘She couldn’t even watch TV. She had to sit in a certain direction because her head veered that way,’ Mrs Trickey said.

And when Mrs Meacock’s husband Tony died of leukaemia in 2011, her grief made her physical pain all the more difficult to bear. By the start of 2012 she was on daily painkillers, including liquid morphine. As the months progressed, she could do less and less.

Driving was impossible and even a shopping trip resulted in her giving up in tears after half an hour.

That was the trigger that convinced her she no longer had any quality of life and she tried to commit suicide in April last year.

When that attempt failed, Mrs Meacock was taken to hospital and sectioned as mentally ill.

Her family challenged the ruling and she was discharged from a secure unit after two weeks but remained terrified of being sent back to hospital.

When the opportunity to go to Dignitas came up, she decided the time was right.

Mrs Trickey described her mother’s last moments at the clinic. ‘We all went into the lovely gardens and took photos and had lots of hugs. And then Mum said: “I am ready now, I want to do this now”.

‘She had to drink this horrible liquid in one go.

‘It tasted disgusting so as soon as she knocked it back she asked for chocolate and drank some water.

‘And then she said, “I’m feeling really sleepy. I love you all”. Within two minutes she was asleep. It was exactly what she wanted.

‘Quick, peaceful and dignified. It wasn’t about us... it was all about Mum.

‘I am happy she is free of pain. Death is something we all face. For some people it’s about how long you can live, but for other people it isn’t.

‘They want quality of life, and without that quality, there is no life.’
