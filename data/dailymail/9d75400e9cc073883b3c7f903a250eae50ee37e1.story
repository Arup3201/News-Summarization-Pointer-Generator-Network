An upsetting video which shows a mother laughing as her toddler abuses a kitten and viciously pulls it by the tail has sparked outrage on social media.

The woman from Paramaribo, Suriname, South America, appears to be encouraging her daughter to torture the ginger kitten as she pulls it by the  ears and slams it to the floor.

She pulls the helpless cat's legs apart, grabs its fur and swings the small kitten by the tail when it tries to escape.

An upsetting video which shows a mother laughing as her toddler abuses a kitten has sparked outrage

The kitten is heard mewing in pain throughout the attack in the family's kitchen, but the child's mother does not intervene.

Instead she is heard giggling and continues to film as her daughter continues with the cruel behaviour.

An older cat attempts to rescue the kitten but it is shooed away by the girl and her mother.

The mother posted the shocking video to her Facebook profile and horrified viewers uploaded it to Youtube to alert others to the abuse.
