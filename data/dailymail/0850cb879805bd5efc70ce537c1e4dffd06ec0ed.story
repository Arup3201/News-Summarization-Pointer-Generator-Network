Nathaly Uribe has all the papers she needs to get a work permit - something the 17-year-old daughter of a construction worker only dreamed of while growing up as an illegal immigrant in the United States.

The high school senior has pinned her hopes on a federal program launched this week which defers deportation for young illegal immigrants, making it easier to get a good job or go to college.

Miss Uribe is just one of thousands lining up to take part in Obama's Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals - the Dream Act -  offering work permits to more than 1 
million young illegal immigrants, though 
they would not obtain legal residency or a path to citizenship.

The so-called 'Dream act' has been criticized as a shrewd political move by President Obama. Opponents accuse him of targeting the Latino vote in the last three months of his re-election campaign.

The American Dream: Thousands of young illegal immigrants queued on Wednesday, August 15 at Navy Pier in Chicago to fill out applications for work permits under Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program

Whatever the political significance, however, the personal impact is clear. On Wednesday, around 13,000 people stood in line in Chicago, clutching piles of paperwork, for a workshop led by immigrant rights advocates at Navy Pier.

Hundreds of potential applicants 
waited 
outside nonprofit offices in Los Angeles for help filing paperwork that 
would lead to a work permit, Social Security number and driver's 
license.

'This is my country. It's where my roots
are,' said Miss Uribe, who moved from Chile when she was a toddler and lives
in Glen Burnie, Maryland. 'It feels great to know that the country that
I call home is finally accepting me.'

Less than three months before an expected tight presidential election, the new immigration program is mired in controversy.

Republican critics accuse President 
Barack Obama of drafting the plan to boost his political standing with 
Latinos ahead of November's vote and say the program favors illegal 
immigrants over unemployed American citizens during dismal economic 
times.

Republican presidential candidate 
Mitt Romney does not support so-called Dream Act legislation for illegal
immigrants who attend college - a key group that Obama aims to reach 
with this program.

The former Massachusetts governor has 
also criticized the deferred action program but has not said it he would
reverse it, pledging instead an unspecified "civil but resolute" 
long-term fix to illegal immigration.

In Arizona, which passed one of the 
nation's toughest anti-immigration laws, Governor Jan Brewer signed an 
executive order this week  directing state agencies to deny driver's 
licenses and other public benefits to illegal immigrants who obtain work
authorizations under the program.

Brewer
said the federal program doesn't give immigrants legal status and she's
following the intent of the current state law denying public benefits 
to them.

Initial concerns 
that federal authorities might take a tough approach on applications or 
that a Republican presidential victory could unravel applicants' gains 
have largely been pushed aside by massive interest from thousands of 
young people eager to work.

'It's something I have been waiting for 
since I was two years old,' said Bupendra Ram, a 25-year-old 
communications graduate student in Fullerton, California, who still 
needs supporting documents from his Fiji Islands home before he can 
apply.

'This offers us an opportunity to fulfill the dreams I've had since I was a child.'

In Los Angeles, one immigrant 
rights' group started hosting hourly information sessions over the last 
month to keep up with the frenzy.

The
Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles has handed out 
12,000 information packets about the program and is encouraging all 
eligible immigrants to apply as long as they have stayed out of legal 
trouble, said Angelica Salas, the organization's director.

Manuel Pastor, director of the University of Southern California's Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration, said 'What
this has done is to signal that the president, who was unable to get 
comprehensive immigration reform, does at least care about the situation
of these immigrants,' Pastor said.

'This is something that has been overwhelmingly popular in the immigrant population and in the Latino population in general.'

Welcome in: Immigrants lined up for help filing applications at workshops around the country. There are fears that filing the identity documents might put relatives at risk of deportation

Some Republican lawmakers have accused Obama of sidestepping Congress and creating a backdoor amnesty program.

'It's a betrayal of American young people," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican.

'We're
supposed to be representing the interests of the American people - not 
people who come here illegally from other countries.'

In
an internal document outlining the program's implementation, Department
of Homeland Security officials estimated more than 1 million people 
would apply in the first year and about 890,000 would be eligible.

On
Wednesday, immigrants lined up for help filing applications at 
workshops around the country. Others sought identity documents from 
consulates to be able to apply.

Jaqueline Cinto said she's still working on gathering the documents she needs, knowing it's her only shot at putting her master's degree in education to good use.

But she's nervous that filing the papers might put her relatives at risk for deportation - even though Homeland Security officials have said they will generally not use applicants' information to track down other family.

'I am even more afraid that I might be denied," said Cinto, 26, who came to New York more than a decade ago from Mexico.

The documents to prove identity could 
include passports, birth certificates, school transcripts, medical, 
financial and military records.

Multiple sworn affidavits, signed under 
penalty of perjury, can also be used, Homeland Security officials said.

Anyone found to have committed fraud will be referred to federal 
immigration agents, the department said.

Laura Lichter, a Denver attorney who heads the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said everyone takes a risk by applying.

'I would say that people are between a rock and a hard place. In most cases, people can take (the government) at their word that their intent is to administer this policy in a fair and appropriate manner but there are going to be people that are going to find themselves having problems,' she saidA decision on each application could take several months, and immigrants have been warned not to leave the country while their application is pending.

The lines on Wednesday grew throughout the day; the crowd in Chicago was so large that workshop organizers told them to come back another day.'Navy Pier is today's Ellis Island, and while they saw New York City, today they see Chicago,' said Illinois congressman Luis Gutierrez. 'But the most important thing is they see America.'
