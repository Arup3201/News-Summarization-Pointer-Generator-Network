The 90s were a breakthrough period for the modern man - a time when it finally became acceptable for the male sex to admit they use moisturiser. 

The new breed of men became so common that a new phrase was coined to describe them - the metrosexual, with stars like David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the trend. 

But since then, young men have been become even better acquainted with bathroom products - many now think nothing of spending hours in front of the mirror or at tanning shops. 

Stars like David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo led the trend for metrosexual men, but there are now four different breeds of super-groomed males. They are Mr Mandrogynous, Mr Mainstream Moustache, Metro-Dude and Mr Remantic

The rise of this behaviour means that the word metrosexual is almost defunct as there are now several different typologies of super-groomed men. 

A new study by Braun has identified the four different new breeds using an expert panel that comprised of grooming writer, Lee Kynaston, the author of Branded Male, Mark Tungate,  owner of Murdock's barbers, Brendan Murdock,  and founder of Privet grooming center, Andy Penniceard. 

They identified them as Mr Mandrogynous, Mr Mainstream Moustache, Metro-Dude and The Remantic. 

Read on to find out if your man fits one of the descriptions:  

Mr Mandrogynous is a slap in the face to old-school stereotypes of red-blooded heterosexual males

Mr Mandrogynous: 

Who: A slap in the face to old-school stereotypes of red-blooded heterosexual males, daily gym sessions keep him looking good as his idols Cristiano Ronaldo and Dan Osborne · 

Grooming Ritual: Buffed and supremely preened, he unselfconsciously practices Manscaping, indulges in regular spray tans and aspires to a hairless aesthetic. 

Expert Opinion: 'He's a narcissist...These guys are working out for themselves. They want to look in the mirror at the gym and feel good because they are so buff' says Lee Kynaston 

 

Mr Mainstream Moustache was inspired by Movember to take on the reinvention of the moustache as a personal project 

Mr Mainstream Moustache: 

Who: Not quite a hipster - he reached peak beard months ago. Inspired by Movember he's taken on the reinvention of the moustache as a personal project ·

Grooming Ritual: Whatever it is, it isn't what everyone else is doing.

Expert Opinion: 'We're starting to see regular guys who want to use a moustache to redefine their appearance. It used to be just the hipster in tweeds. But once David Beckham was spotted with one – well, all of that changed,' says Brendan Murdock 

 

Metro-Dude is reinventing geek-chic 

Metro-Dude: 

Who: Re-inventing geek-chic, he's the technophile driving the UK's digital revolution - most likely to be found talking algorithms and app building · 

Grooming Ritual: Up on the latest gadgetry but with the nous to get value for money, Mark Zuckerberg's hoodie and jeans are just the memory of a nightmare.

Expert Opinion: 'They are the ones who've been so busy staying on top of life, reinventing what it means to be a tech-superstar that it's taken a moment of inspiration from a partner or wife to up their grooming game' according to Mark Tungate

 

There's no work-out too tough, and no regime too expensive for The Remantic 

The Remantic:  

Who: The re-born romantic, he's suave, sophisticated and high-powered. This guy sets trends in the city on a wage that is finally enough to live the lifestyle he's always aspired to. Fancy cars? Bespoke suits? You name it, of course he has it · 

Grooming Ritual: There's no work-out too tough, and no regime too expensive. This guy will go to any lengths to prove he's the best.

Expert Opinion: 'These men are the last word in class and they demand the best from every element of their life,' says Lee Kynaston.
