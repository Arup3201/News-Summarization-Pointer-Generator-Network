Lighting up the night sky an impressive 55,000 LED lamps this dazzling cathedral recently outshone the competition at the 2012 Licht Festival in Ghent, Belgium.

A 28 metre arch entrance led spectators through a gallery of bright colours created by ‘curtains’ of joined LED lights placed onto the building.

The Romanesque cathedral, created by Italian lighting experts Luminarie De Cagna, was one of 29 installations at the festival.

This blinding work of art was the highlight of the festival which has been held in the Belgian city of Gent since last year

The artwork is made from 55000 LEDs by the Italian family business Luminarie De Cagna

Luminaire de Cagna have been doing light installations since the 1930’s, but back then the family business would illuminate buildings and squares with oil and carbide lamps.

Despite the 55,000 lights the installation only consumes 20 kilowatts per hour. Contrary to what you might think, one of the festivals aims to bring attention to electricity and energy consumption and many of the installations use low-energy LED lamps.

Other works on display included 3D projections, a field of light-bulb flowers and amazingly enough a phone booth aquarium.

Artists
Benoit Deseille and Benedetto Bufalino explained that ever since mobile
phones became more and more common telephone booths were abandoned. 

‘We
rediscover this glass cage transformed into an aquarium, full of 
exotically coloured fish; an invitation to escape and travel.’Unfortunately the cathedral is no longer on display as the festival ended January 29.

‘We
bring light into people’s lives at the end of winter when the days are 
long and people start longing for spring,’  says Kaat Heirbrant the 
festival's coordinator.

Shine: 'Curtains' made up of thousands of lights were attached to the sides of the building as well as inside

That's a new way of going about your daily chores! The artwork continued inside the building taking both art fans and those about their daily business through a tunnel of lights
