The son of movie star Jackie Chan has apologised and begged the public for a second chance following his release from a six-month jail sentence for allowing people to use marijuana in his apartment.

Jaycee Chan, 32, said at a news conference in Beijing that he was rededicating himself to his family and entertainment business career.

Chan, who like his father has worked as an actor and singer, said he wanted to apologise for his mistakes and was ashamed. 

He said he had 'no reason, no excuse' for the behavior that led to his arrest in August alongside Taiwanese actor Ko Kai and others.

'After this correction by the justice system, I have changed my outlook on life and my values,' Jaycee said.

He and Ko both tested positive for marijuana and police seized more than 100 grams of the drug from Jaycee's Beijing apartment.

He could have been sentenced to up to three years, but was shown leniency by the court for having come clean with his law breaking.

Chan's news conference was broadcast live on Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, illustrating the propaganda value Beijing hopes to gain from the high-profile case amid a sweeping anti-drugs crackdown.

'I made mistakes, I will remember this lesson, I won't commit mistakes again in the future,' he said in Beijing.

'I want to apologise to everyone for my mistakes. I'm genuinely sorry.'

Experts say the arrests are part of a wider campaign by Beijing to promote morality. Chinese authorities have also targeted prostitution and the broader illegal drugs trade over the past year. 

In the first half of last year, there was a 53 per cent rise in drug investigations in Beijing to more than 1,800 cases.

Jaycee, whose mother is former Taiwanese actress Lin Feng-jiao, was raised in Los Angeles and has appeared in about 20 films, most of them low-budget Hong Kong and mainland Chinese productions.

His father, known for his leading roles in Rush Hour and Shanghai Knights, has publicly apologised for his son's drug use and pledged to work with him on his recovery. 

The actor and son of Jackie Chan said he realised he had not been a good role model as he apologised

Jaycee Chan served six months in prison for the drugs offences and was released from custody on Saturday

Jaycee, whose mother is former Taiwanese actress Lin Feng-jiao, was raised in Los Angeles and has appeared in about 20 films, most of them low-budget Hong Kong and mainland Chinese productions.

His father, known for his leading roles in Rush Hour and Shanghai Knights, has publicly apologised for his son's drug use and pledged to work with him on his recovery. 

The incident was sensitive for Jackie because of his status as a Chinese anti-drugs ambassador and deputy to the national legislature's main consultative body.

Jaycee said his father did not intervene on his behalf and that he received no special treatment in prison, where conditions were 'quite harsh'.

Jackie Chan, known for his leading roles in Rush Hour and Shanghai Knights (pictured), has publicly apologised for his son's drug use and pledged to work with him on his recovery.

Speaking slowly in a quiet voice, he said he'd first encountered marijuana eight years earlier on a trip to the Netherlands, but only became a regular user about two years ago.

'I'm very ashamed that I haven't been a good role model,' he said. 'I want to start again, but I know that it's the mass media that will decide.'

Jaycee's arrest put his entertainment career in jeopardy, with several Chinese management companies saying they would refuse to employ celebrities caught using drugs.

While professing his love for show business, Jaycee said he was now focused on spending time with his parents over next week's Lunar New Year holiday.
