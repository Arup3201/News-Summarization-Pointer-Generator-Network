A 23-year-old man is in a serious condition in hospital after being stabbed multiple times in a horrific street attack in which he was chased from his car by a group of up to four men.

The motorist was allegedly stabbed in the neck, arm and twice in the leg during the incident which occurred on a slip road off Mancunian Way in Manchester just before 3pm.

Police said the suspects, believed to be four men aged between 25 and 35, fled the scene after the incident. They are currently being hunted by officers.

Greater Manchester Police said an investigation has been launched into the incident after the victim, who was driving a Vauxhall Astra prior to the attack, was seemingly targeted.

Officers said they believe the Astra and another car, possibly a hatchback, were travelling along Chorlton Road at speed when the Astra hit the kerb and came to a halt.

The driver got out and ran off towards a nearby grassy area but the occupants of the other car pulled over, ran after him and allegedly stabbed him a number of times.

The men then fled the scene in their vehicle and are now being sought by police. 

The victim was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary with multiple stab wounds. He was described this evening as being conscious and in a stable condition.

Detective Inspector Aidy Gallagher, based at North Manchester, said: 'A man is in hospital with stab wounds, but at this stage we believe they are not too serious.

'From what we know so far it appears the Astra and another car were driving at speed along Chorlton Road when the Astra hit the kerb and stopped.

'He ran off but was pursued by the people in the other car and then stabbed.

A Vauxhall Astra, believed to belong to the victim, could be seen parked at the scene today. It is thought the driver ran from his vehicle before being chased onto a verge by four suspects and stabbed in broad daylight

'Earlier indications suggest this is not a road rage incident, but we are keeping an open mind about the exact circumstances.

'We are now appealing for witnesses so, if anyone saw these cars speeding down Chorlton Road, or the stabbing incident itself, then please call police.'

Police said one of the suspects was black, while the other three were described as Asian.

North West Ambulance Service said paramedics arrived at the scene just after 3pm, and Greater Manchester Police confirmed the force's helicopter was also scrambled alongside several officers.

Following the incident, which occurred at the junction of Chester Road and Chorlton Road, at the roundabout at the bottom of Mancunian Way, police cordoned off surrounding roads.

Police said Chorlton Road, at the junction with Mancunian Way, is expected to remain closed for some time while the scene is examined.

Detectives could be seen carrying out investigations at the scene as darkness fell in Manchester this evening. 

A recovery truck was also brought in to tow away a vehicle, believed to be the Astra belonging to the victim.  

Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
