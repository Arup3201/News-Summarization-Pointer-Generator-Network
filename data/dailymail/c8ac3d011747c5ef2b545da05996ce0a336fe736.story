Grandmother Linda White, 48, was arrested by police after calling 911 and telling the operator: 'I need cigarettes'

A drunk woman who ran out of cigarettes while drinking beers with her boyfriend called 911 to ask if a police officer could deliver a packet.

Linda White, 48, of Granbury, Texas, called 911 around 1am and told an operator: 'I need some cigarettes'.

The grandmother can then be heard on the 911 call to mutter: 'I think I got the wrong number' before hanging up.

But police officers were dispatched to Ms White's home - not to deliver cigarettes - but to charge her with abusing the 911 emergency service.

She was released on bond after the misdemeanor, which can carry up to a $2,000 fine and 180 days in prison.

Ms White has now apologised and said she was drunk when she made the call after spending the evening drinking with her boyfriend Gary Roberts.

She told NBC News: 'We were just kicking it in the back yard -- a few beers too many. Next thing you know, we're out of cigarettes.

'Well, I didn't want to drive to town. I was drunk, you know, but in my back yard.

'Who's the safest person to call? Your police department, I thought.'

But commenting on how the police arrested her after her request for cigarettes, Ms White remarked: 'They don't deliver - they pick up.'

The 911 call: Ms White tells the operator: 'I need some cigarettes' before saying she might have the wrong number and hanging up

A vital service: Ms White was later arrested for abusing the 911 number which is only to be used in the case of an emergency

She then added: 'I'm deeply sorry for what I did. I'm embarrassed. It's not me. It doesn't make me a bad person.'

But police were not amused.

Hood County Chief Deputy Biff Temple told NBC: 'A call for deputies to bring cigarettes to the resident is not an emergency call.

'We don't take jokes lightly when you are abusing the 911 service.'

He then added: 'She did not get any cigarettes.' 

Bad judgement: Ms White, pictured with her boyfriend Gary Roberts, has since apologised for actions - saying she was drunk when she made the call
