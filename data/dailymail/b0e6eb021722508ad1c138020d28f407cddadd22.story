Nurse David Hadfield had denied attacking the elderly patient but was found guilty by a jury five weeks ago

A nurse has been jailed for 15 months for headbutting a vulnerable patient in his care.

David Hadfield, 54, struck  72-year-old Thomas Bretherton three times while he was being treated at Royal Blackburn Hospital.

The vicious attack left the seriously ill patient with cuts to his forehead.

Mr Bretherton was admitted to hospital in August last year with acute pancreatitis and Hadfield was assigned to look after him, a court heard.

The pensioner, who was confused and having trouble breathing, was attacked after he became distressed when Hadfield changed his sheets. 

Father-of-two Hadfield, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, who had been a nurse for 30 years before the incident on August 6 last year, denied attacking the pensioner but was found guilty by a jury following a trial five weeks ago.

Jailing him for just 15 months, Judge Simon Newell said the attack, which lasted a few seconds, happened when Hadfield 'lost control'.

He said: 'You were dealing with an elderly, vulnerable and very ill man.

'Ordinary members of the community would find this a gross violation of trust.

'When Mr Bretherton was admitted to hospital, he would have expected care and compassion.

'You were part of that respected team but on that night you caused harm and damage to Mr Bretherton.

'You caused distress and upset to his family. His wife and children would have expected their father to be treated well and professionally.

'They had to face his death for wholly separate reasons, which is difficult for any family, but the difficulty was compounded by this incident and still to this day isn't over.

'There is no doubt that his family will have concerns over what would have happened to their father if you hadn't assaulted him that day.'

Mr Bretherton died shortly after the alleged attack, although his passing was not related at all to the incident. 

But his family said they felt 'devastated' at Hadfield's short sentence.

Speaking after the sentencing at Preston Crown Court today, Mr Bretherton's wife Marie, who cried as she walked out of court, said: 'The sentence is far too short.

'It doesn't bring my husband back or change what has happened.

'As a family, I don't think we'll feel any sense of closure because he's been sent to prison for a few months. I feel devastated.' 

The court heard how Mr Bretherton, of Blackburn, Lancs., had been 'calm and sleeping' when Hadfield entered the room at around midnight during a night shift to change his sheet.

But, when the grandfather-of-five became distressed and tried to get out of bed, Hadfield became 'aggressive'.

Judge Newell added: 'You went in to see Mr Bretherton and he became difficult but nothing that is out of the ordinary with patients in hospital environments.

'There was a clash of heads and for whatever reason, to the disbelief of others present, you responded by saying 'come on then'.

'You headbutted him three times. For whatever reason, your loss of control lasted for seconds only.

'It was brief, unexplained and wholly out of character.'

The court heard how nurses witnessed the incident on a monitor located near to where they were standing at the time.

Hadfield was found guilty of unlawful wounding following a four-day trial.
