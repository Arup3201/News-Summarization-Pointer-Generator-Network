Prince Philip was forced to withdraw from an official engagement yesterday after falling ill on the eve of a service to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s coronation.

The Duke of Edinburgh, who turns 92 on Monday, had been due to join the Queen last night at a gala reception for the Royal National Institute of Blind People at St James’s Palace.

Prince Philip has not been taken to hospital and was staying overnight at Buckingham Palace, where a spokesman had no details of his illness - but said he was expected to be at the service today.

Hours ahead of the Queen's Diamond 
Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace last June, Prince Philip was 
hospitalised with a bladder infection and unable to attend the rest of her celebrations.

At tonight’s event the Queen enjoyed performances by West End star Michael Ball and operatic quartet Il Divo. Ball sang People, from the musical Funny Girl.

‘I thought it appropriate for the event,’ he said before the reception. ‘I have sung for the Queen on various occasions, including when we did a version of Les Misérables at Windsor Castle a few years ago to mark the centenary of the Entente Cordiale with France. This is a great cause.’

Il Divo performed a Spanish version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. One of the group, Urs Buhler, from Switzerland, said afterwards: ‘It was an unusual performance for us, in such an intimate room.

‘This was the fourth or fifth time we have performed in front of the Queen - we have done the Royal Variety Performance two or three times.’

Another star attending - but not singing
this year, though he has done so at the event before - was Rod Stewart,
with wife Penny Lancaster. Both are vice presidents of RNIB.

Stewart said he had been suffering from a virus. ‘I'm feeling great and my show at the O2 tomorrow will go ahead,’ he said. ‘I've sung at this event before - mostly the standards, but Maggie May too - and would like to sing here again in the future.’

His wife added: ‘I think it was Rod's performance a few years ago that has sparked all these performances from other artists.’

Downton Abbey creator and RNIB supporter Julian Fellowes said the organisation was a 'shining example of all that is best in the charity sector'. He told the Queen: 'In recognising the work of the charity by your presence you have made us all very proud.'

The Queen has been the patron of RNIB since her accession to the throne in 1952.
