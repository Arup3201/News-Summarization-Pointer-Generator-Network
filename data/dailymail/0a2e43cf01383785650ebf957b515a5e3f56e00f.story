Kim Kardashian has never been shy of flaunting her famous assets - the realty star first shot to worldwide fame after her sex tape was leaked on to the internet. 

But since giving birth to baby North, the 33-year-old has been pictured increasingly in a range of outfits that barely cover her ample chest. 

This summer, Kim has made sure that all eyes were on her at a number of red carpet events. 

In August, she attended the MTV Music Video Awards in a mini dress that appeared to defy gravity, ensuring she attracted just as much attention from the photographers and TV cameramen as bona fide music stars like Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj.

It has been a regular pattern since she first gave birth on June 13 last year. 

Three and a half months later she was out partying in Paris with a dress that exposed more than half of her post-pregnancy chest.  

On October 1, 2013, Kim wore a dress designed especially by Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci as she accompanied him to the premiere of Mademoiselle C on the Champs Elysees.

The outfit was designed to mark a comeback for Kim, who had spent the previous ten weeks on a strict diet and exercise regime in an effort to lose her baby weight. 

It has set the tone for most of her red carpet appearances ever since, with each costume's shared feature being a wide plunging neckline, bearing plenty of cleavage. 

Femail has taken a look back at Kim's pre and post-pregnancy outfits, comparing the reality star's style between now and then:
