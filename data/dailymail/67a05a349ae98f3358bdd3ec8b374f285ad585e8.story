Medicine bottles are scattered over every surface. Oxygen tanks sit in one corner, while a drip stand is set up in another.

But in the chaotic, hospital-like room in which Michael Jackson died, the oddest thing of all is behind that drip stand – an apparent shrine for babies.

New photographs released of the singer’s huge and ornately decorated bedroom at his Los Angeles mansion reveal a dresser top crammed with portraits of unidentified young children.

Across the front is a placard bearing a photograph of a smiling little boy and the caption ‘sweet baby’.

Some of the images on the dresser top have been turned into plates. The identities of the babies are unclear, although at least some of the pictures may be of Jackson’s three children – Prince, Paris and Blanket.

The pictures, released this week by Los Angeles police, have been shown to jurors considering a multi-million pound compensation claim by Jackson’s mother, Katherine, against his tour promoters AEG Live.

She claims the company failed to investigate properly Jackson’s personal doctor, Conrad Murray, and missed warning signs about the singer’s health before his death in 2009.

Murray was jailed for four years for involuntary manslaughter in 2011 after giving Jackson, 50, a lethal dose of the powerful hypnotic anaesthetic Propofol.

Some pictures showing the shocking state of Jackson’s bedroom were released at Murray’s trial.

But these new photographs reveal the true extent of his tragic decline into prescription drug dependency.

Bottles of Propofol were found all over the bedroom. An empty one was lying discarded on the floor, along with a used bottle of flumazenil.

The latter is used to offset the excessive drowsiness brought on by other drugs Jackson was taking. A list of nearby 24-hour pharmacies was also found in the room.

The trial is revealing new evidence of the extent to which Jackson’s medical care was alarming those around him. On Monday, jurors were shown an email from Randy Phillips, the chief executive of AEG Live.

In it he expressed serious concerns about the treatment Jackson was receiving from his dermatologist, Arnold Klein. The company was ‘scared to death’ of drug injections he was receiving, Mr Phillips wrote.

The email was sent in response to a £33,000 medical bill Mr Klein had sent to Jackson’s manager.

The treatments included shots of cosmetic drugs including Restalyne and Botox, as well as other unidentified intra-muscular injections.
