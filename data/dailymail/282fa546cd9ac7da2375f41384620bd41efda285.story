A mystery woman was found floating in her swimming costume in a Sydney bay three days ago but police still don’t know who she is.

NSW Marine Area Command is seeking help from the public to try and identify the dead woman as they remain clueless about her identity.

A Caucasian woman thought to be aged between 45 and 55 was spotted at about 7pm on Saturday near moored boats in Kogarah Bay, a suburb in southern Sydney.

NSW Marine Area Command are trying to identify the body of a woman found on Saturday evening 

She was wearing a black and white swimming top and a short black skirt and is described as being about 165cm tall with a heavy build and short ginger or brown hair.

It was a passing boater who initially saw the body, a Westpac Life Saver helicopter then flew to the scene at around 7pm to investigate before the police came and retrieved it.

A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday morning: ‘Enquiries are continuing.’

Police issued an official request for help from the public to try and identify the woman on Monday.
