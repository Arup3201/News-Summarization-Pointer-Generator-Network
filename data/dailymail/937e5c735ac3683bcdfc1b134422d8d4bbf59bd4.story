If you have ever wanted to experience Qantas business class but never had the money or points - you can now combine your cash and air miles to make an online bid to experience how the other half fly.

Frequent flyers who have points coming out of their ears have no need to panic about ending up in cattle class as the points-only upgrades will be processed first before the online bidding begins.

However, economy passengers can only get involved in the Bid Now Upgrades if they receive an invite via an email seven days before departure.

Bidder's offers can be modified or cancelled at any time up until 24 hours before departure, but passengers don't see each other's offers.

Passengers will be notified via email about one day before departure about whether their offer has been successful - and if not, they are not out of pocket and keep their original seat.

The minimum points needed are from 3,000 for a domestic upgrade and from 5,000 for an international upgrade with minimum dollar amount also required.

Qantas Loyalty CEO Lesley Grant said the system is designed for passengers who don't have a balance high enough to request an upgrade using points alone.

'For a member who doesn't have enough points to submit an upgrade request for their whole family, Bid Now Upgrades offers an alternative chance to travel at the front of the plane with their spouse and children using a combination of money and points,' she said.

Ms Grant said the new system will not change the process or priority for frequent flyers submitting Classic Upgrade Rewards more than 24 hours out from their scheduled departure.

'This new initiative will in no way impact the chances of members securing a Classic Upgrade Reward - these will always be confirmed first regardless of their Frequent Flyer tier and they remain the best value option,' she said.
