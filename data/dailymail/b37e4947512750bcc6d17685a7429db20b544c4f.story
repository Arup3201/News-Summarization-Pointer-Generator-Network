IN MONTMARTE by Sue Roe (Fig Tree £20)

Montmartre. Two syllables which still pack a little shimmer of magic. It was a hill apart – la Butte – where life felt different from in the rest of Paris.

Here most of the famous names of modern art from Picasso downwards had at some time lived and gone hungry.

Sue Roe knows every inch of Montmartre then and now. Starting in 1900 she follows its inhabitants’ adventures and hardships, triumphs and disasters, from street to street and bar to bar till she reaches 1910.

A little shimmer of magic: Most of the famous names of modern art have at some time lived in Montmarte

Her narrative is like watching a newsreel of clips of old footage, some of which you’ll have seen before but never assembled in one continuous loop to scroll down.

Many books of art history get boring because they proceed endlessly from picture to picture or get tangled in knots of theory. This book skates lightly over such matters as Cubism, saying what usefully can be said in words and no more. The key pictures are given their due, though they are shockingly under-illustrated.

All the time the caravan moves on diverting us with the rows, the love affairs, the rivalries, the fights, the parties, the drunken bouts.

If you don’t know it all already this is a reliable, entertaining guide to a period when artists discovered new ways of seeing and of expressing themselves.

The fascinating thought is that they were still unknown and unappreciated. They could hardly sell their pictures for a few hundred francs, which today would command millions of dollars if they weren’t already in museums. Dominating the scene and the period were Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso with their respective ‘bondes’ — or gangs — of followers. During this decade Matisse was by far the most successful and well-known of the two.

Leader of the modernists: Pablo Picasso's work now sells for millions

He was 30 when he arrived in Montmartre with a wife, Amelie, and already had two children. Amelie devoted herself to his career and kept them solvent by modelling hats in a shop.

With his solid beard and moustache, his round spectacles and the frock-coat she made him wear, Matisse looked the essence of reliability. He was nicknamed by the other artists ‘le Docteur’ though his nature was more daring than most others’.

The two big art shows of the year were the Salon des Independants and the Salon d’Automne. Matisse electrified them in 1904 by showing ‘Mme Matisse’ in a huge floral hat with a stripe of pale green paint running down the centre of her face to the end of her nose. This uninhibited use of colour applied to landscapes and interiors, where such colour did not occur in real life, shocked the public and the critics. One reacted by calling Matisse and his followers ‘les Fauves’ — the Wild Beasts. Their canvases were too shocking to sell except to a few patrons. Recognition came slowly.

Nobody would have nicknamed Picasso ‘le Docteur’. He was 19 when he paid his first visit from Barcelona, a slight, small, uncertain-looking youth with a blob of already receding dark hair. He hardly spoke because he knew no French.

All that was recognisable from our familiar images of him were his black voracious pools of eyes. When he came back to Montmartre in 1904 he found Fernande Olivier, a tall, redheaded model. He spent nearly a year persuading her to leave the sculptor she lived with to share his studio.

She found a place of unutterable squalor with barely any furniture and every surface crusted with dirt and squashed paint tubes. There was a white mouse who lived in a drawer.

Once he had got her, Picasso would not let her model for other painters. He had seduced too many models himself to risk it so Fernande devoted herself to a life of leisure, reading novels and demanding perfume and chocolates whenever he made a sale. Picasso waited on her like a dog.

They were often caricatured as a couple because she towered above him. She also dominated him as his Muse for the seven years they were together. Once, during a row, she shook him until his buttons fell off. But it was mainly a peaceful partnership; the opium they smoked saw to that.

Sue Roe loves describing low-life in lip-smacking detail and she has a great cast to bring on — characters like the wild bacchanalian artist Modigliani, the child-like visionary Henri Rousseau and the beady-eyed writer Gertrude Stein, who claimed that she sat for Picasso 90 times for her formidable portrait.

The author claims too much for Montmartre’s role in the artistic revolutions of the time. By 1910 its artistic importance was over. Picasso and Fernande were rich enough to move to the Boulevard Clichy and employ a maid. And the artistic centre had crossed the Seine to Montparnasse.
