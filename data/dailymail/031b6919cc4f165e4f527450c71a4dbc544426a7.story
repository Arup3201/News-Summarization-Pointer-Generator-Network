More than $150,000 has been raised for the funeral of a toddler who died after wandering away from his grandmother's Toronto apartment in the bitter cold. 

Elijah Marsh was found in a nearby backyard on Thursday morning - six hours after leaving the building wearing just a T-shirt and diaper as temperatures plunged to -4F (-20 C).

The little boy was rushed to hospital and police announced his death several hours later.

The news was a 'gut-wrenching moment' for Justin Kozuch, 36, a Toronto reporter with two children - so he decided to launch a fundraising campaign on Tilt.com for the boy's family.

Tragedy: Three-year-old Elijah March, pictured, wandered into the bitter-cold streets of Toronto early on Thursday wearing only a T-shirt, diaper and boots. He was found and pronounced dead in hospital

Last seen: Security footage from the building shows him pushing his way through the apartment building's front door just after 4am, when the temperature in the area was -2F, but with windchill it felt more like -18F

By Saturday morning, it had raised $153,620. Tilt.com is waiving credit card fees for  contributions.

'Way to go, Internet!' Kozuch tweeted as the total continued to grow. 'I'm so honoured.'

Elijah had been seen on CCTV leaving his grandparents' apartment building around 4am.

The boy's family woke at about 7.30am to find he was missing. They had last seen him when they put him to bed wearing a T-shirt and diaper at about 9.30pm. 

Security footage from the building shows Elijiah pushing his way through the apartment building's front door at 4.05am. 

He was last seen on camera on the apartment's driveway at 4.20am before wandering off, according to CTV News.  

Outpour: Justin Kozuch, 36, a Toronto reporter with two young children of his own decided to set up a fundraiser for the family of the little boy - and by Friday afternoon, it had raised more than $150,000

Found: He was discovered in the corner of a backyard just a short distance from his grandparents' home

At 4.20 am, the temperature in the area was -2F, and with windchill it felt more like -18F. 

The boy was found  'tucked away in the corner' in the backyard of a home at 10.20am. He was taken to North York General Hospital in life-threatening condition and later died. 

There is no indication as to why the boy left his apartment or where he was trying to go, police said.

More than 100 officers took part in the search for Elijah and volunteers came from all over the city. 

Toronto Mayor John Tory offered support for Elijah's family. 

'As a father and as a grandfather, you just can't imagine what that family is going through dealing with this whole thing - from beginning to wherever it ends,' he said.
