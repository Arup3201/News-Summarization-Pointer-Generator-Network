Wearing couture gowns and dazzling smiles, some 20 young girls, hand-picked  from around the world, have gathered in Paris to attend the high-society Debutantes Ball.

Guests included Lady Amelia Windsor, granddaughter of the Queen's cousin Prince Edward, Duke of Kent; Kyra Kennedy, daughter of Robert Kennedy Jr. and great-niece to the late President John F. Kennedy; and Lauren Marbe, the 17-year-old daughter of a London taxi driver, who hit headlines with her IQ score of 161, one point higher than Einstein.

Dressed in Dior, Kyra Kennedy and her father Robert opened the ball - held at the Automobile Club on Saturday - to the sound of a gypsy waltz, at one of the social events of the year where high society meets haute couture.

The glittering event saw the 
debutantes dance, dine and network the night away in dresses loaned by 
some of Paris's most famous couture houses.

Lord
 George Porchester whose family owns Highclere Castle, the setting for 
the hit television series Downton Abbey, was also invited, along with 
18-year-old Kennedy's father Robert, the son of John F. Kennedy's 
brother Robert, who was also assassinated.

Others
 taking part included British royal Lady Amelia Windsor, the 
granddaughter of one of Queen Elizabeth II's cousins, Francesca Packer 
Barham, granddaughter of Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer and Romy 
David, daughter of Seinfeld creator Larry David.

From
 Asia, there was Akshita Bhanjdeo of India's Bhanja dynasty, Filipina 
socialite Monica Urquijo Zobel, and Rebecca Eu, the Canberra-based 
daughter of a Chinese healthcare company chief.

Now in her 21st year organising the ball, Ophelie Renouard had made no secret of her quest to track down as many big names as possible.

In another publicity coup this year, she secured the presence of a London taxi driver's daughter, Lauren Marbe.

The 17-year-old made headlines recently when she notched up an IQ test score of 161, one point higher than Einstein.

'I read about her in the newspapers and so I phoned her up and she said, "It is not my world but if you invite me I will come",' Renouard said.

Her father, wearing black tie for the first time, was overwhelmed. He said: 'This is a dream! I still cannot believe it.'

The event, held at the Automobile Club of France, is based on the debutantes balls that were once an established part of the British upper class's social calendar.

These elaborate affairs launched well-born young women into polite society and, with luck, also introduced them to a potential husband.

But the balls started to fall out of favour in the late 1950s, after Queen Elizabeth abolished the practice of the debutantes also being presented at court.

In recent decades, they have been reinvented as glittering fundraisers with the emphasis on philanthropy and contact-building rather than finding a potential suitor.

Among the new generation of balls, Renouard's alone offers participants the chance to borrow an haute couture dress for the night.

'They are not interested in finding a husband, they are too young,' she said. 'What they prefer is the dress, because even if they are privileged they have never been to an haute couture house.'

In previous years Le Bal has attracted the daughters of European aristocracy, as well as Hollywood A-listers such as Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, Andie MacDowell, Clint Eastwood and Sylvester Stallone.

The ball now has a strong showing from Asia, but Renouard says she still has to crack Russia.

'I'm not good on Russia. It's all about networks...', she said.
