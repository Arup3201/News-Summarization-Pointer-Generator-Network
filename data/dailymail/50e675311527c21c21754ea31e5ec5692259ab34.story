Predator: Ouldkount Belabbas sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl in Madame Tussauds' gift shop

An Algerian illegal immigrant who sexually assaulted an eight-year-old girl while she shopped for her mother’s birthday present at Madame Tussauds has been jailed for five years.

Ouldkount Belabbas, 42, kissed and led the child away while she was deciding how to spend her pocket money in the gift shop at the world famous London tourist attraction.

The 'highly predatory' paedophile is believed to have lived in the country illegally for 13 years prior to the offence but shortly after being arrested claimed asylum in the hope of avoiding deportation.

After pinning the child in a corner of the gift shop, Belabbas began touching her chest until a group of Venezuelan tourists stopped him, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Sentencing, Judge Alistair McCreath said: 'This defendant had been, in the time preceding the commission of these offences, in the habit of going to Madame Tussauds.'

Lesley Jones, prosecuting, told the court that since his arrest, Belabbas had applied for asylum.

She said: 'He is an Algerian national known to the immigration authorities. At the time of his arrest he had not made a claim for asylum and had failed to sign with the immigration authorities.

'He apparently has now made a claim and that is being considered,' she added.

However, Barry Kogan, defending, said his client intended to return home after serving his sentence.

He said: 'The fact of the matter is, this man has been in this country since 2001. He has no convictions recorded against him for anything of this nature - either violent or sexual.'

He added: 'Once he has served his sentence, and he has already served several months, he wants to return to Algeria.'

'He realises that his life is not well here and he wants to return to his home country where his mother and sisters are.'

CCTV evidence showed Belabbas had spent a 'significant period' of time in the waxwork museum’s coffee and gift shops, with no apparent purpose on August 5 last year.

Describing the moments before the attack, the judge said: 'The victim asked her mother whether she could go into the gift shop.

'She didn’t tell her why, but her planned motive was to buy a small present with her pocket money to give to her mother on her forthcoming birthday.'

It was at this point that the Algerian, who was living illegally in the UK under the name Xavier Garrero, saw his opportunity and approached the schoolgirl.

No reason: CCTV evidence showed Belabbas had spent a 'significant period' of time in the waxwork museum's coffee and gift shops, with no apparent purpose on August 5 last year

The judge continued: 'He approached her and engaged in conversation, he offered her praise.

'He
 probably kissed her in some way that was not sexual, but was designed 
to encourage her to believe the he was a harmless person, someone rather
 like a father figure.

'He
 took the degree with some minor degree of force from the main body of 
the gift shop into part of it that was little more than an alcove. He 
took her into the corner of it which was not fully covered by CCTV.'

'The
 whole of the evidence satisfies me beyond any doubt whatever that while
 he had her pinned into the corner, he sexually assaulted her,' the 
judge added,

Branding the Algerian national a 
'dangerous' offender, the judge said he needed to be given
 an extended sentence for public protection.

Belabbas,
 of no fixed address, was found guilty of one count of sexual assault of
 a child under 13, and one count of abducting a child.

He must serve five years in prison before being released and serving eight years on an extended licence.

A Home Office spokesman said he was unable to comment on whether Belabbas would be deported.

He
 added, however, that any individual from outside the European Economic 
Area that has been sentenced to more than year in prison while their 
asylum is pending is eligible for deportation after their term has been 
served.

Although the Home Office issues automatic deportation papers to all non European convicts sentenced to more than a year in prison, hundreds of the orders are challenged on human rights grounds.

A series of cases have emerged in which criminals including killers and rapists have successfully claimed deportation would breach their human rights, to the fury of Conservative MPs.

Belabbas fled Madame Tussauds after the group of Venezuelan tourists stopped him assaulting the girl, but returned a few days later and was arrested.

The judge said:
 'This was not in any sense a chance encounter... Whatever he may have 
been doing on previous day with whatever motivation, on this day I have 
no doubt at all that he was where he was, doing what he did, because he 
was in a manner that was highly predatory awaiting the arrival, if it 
were to happen, of a child who he could make his victim.'

He
 added: 'This child has been significantly harmed by what happened and 
there is at least a risk that that harm will persist as she grows up and
 matures. It is to be profoundly wished that she can overcome it.'

The judge praised the child for the 'immense fortitude' she had shown in giving evidence during the trial.

In
 court Lesley Jones, prosecuting, read a statement the victim's mother 
had prepared on behalf of her daughter, saying she had since lost 
confidence and become unable to leave her mother’s side.

Ms Jones continued: 'She [the victim’s
 mother] said, she [the victim] is wary of men and men of particular 
ethnic origin, which wasn’t the case before this incident.'

The now 10-year-old’s mother also provided a statement to the court.

Ms Jones said: 'She says she feels blame, guilt and anger and upset as a result.'

'She also says that she felt ashamed and embarrassed that this had happened to her daughter when she was in her care.

'She says it is hard to put her trust in people, and the world, because her trust has really been rocked to the core.'

Defending, Barry Kogan said the abduction committed by his client only resulted in the child being taken 'a few yards' from the 'chocolate section of the gift shop over to the marbles section'.

While accepting that Belabbas had still not admitted his actions, he added: 'He was at the time down on his luck.'

'He had been badly assaulted in the spring and had to have operations on his face. He had lost his job - he had been working on the market, he was having to sleep rough.'

Alongside his five year sentence, Belabbas was made subject to a sexual offences prevention order until further notice.

The order states he must not contact children under the age of 16, must not engage in conversation with children under the age of 16, and must not work in an environment where he would come into contact with anyone under 16.
