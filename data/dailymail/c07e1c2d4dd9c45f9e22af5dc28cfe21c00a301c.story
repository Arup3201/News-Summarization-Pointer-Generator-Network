This is the terrifying moment a bolt of lightning struck a tree - just feet away from a rocket scientist and his friends.

Bruce Hyland, 63, was camping at Shoshone Lake in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, with three companions when a hailstorm hit.

Sheltering under a blue tarpaulin, he took out his point-and-shoot camera to record hail striking the lake's surface -  but was stunned to capture a lightning bolt instead.

Lighting up the sky: This photograph, taken by 63-year-old rocket scientist Bruce Hyland, captures the split-second moment a bolt of lightning struck a tree at Shoshone Lake in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming

Strike: The bolt hit a tree less than 30 feet away from the campers - causing the ground to explode (pictured)

Shelter: Huddled under a tarpaulin, Mr Hyland took out his camera to record hail landing on the lake's surface -  but was stunned to capture the lightning bolt instead. Above, where the camper was stood during the strike

Footage shows the split-second moment the bolt struck a tree less than 30 feet away from the campers, lighting up the sky and causing the ground around it to explode.

Mr Hyland, who works as an Aerojet engineer in Orangevale, California, said he had heard an 'enormous explosion', but had only seen the lightning when he replayed the footage.

'It was a jaw-dropping experience looking at the footage - you can't believe you were that close,' he said.

'I
 didn't see a flash or feel a jolt or any static electricity that people
 say they feel when lightning strikes - we just heard an enormous 
explosion. 

Serene: Mr Hyland, from Orangevale, California, said he had heard an 'enormous explosion', but had only seen the lightning when he replayed the footage. Above, Shoshone Lake  just moments before the lightning bolt stuck

Explosions: Footage shows the split-second moment the bolt struck the tree, causing several 'explosions'

Near-miss: Mr Hyland, who captured the lightning on a point-and-shoot camera, described it as 'jaw-dropping'

'When I played back the video, I saw the ground erupting. We were about 30ft from the tree that the lighting hit.'

He added: 'We are just relieved that no one was 
injured - or worse. We were in a remote area with no cell phone service,
 it would have taken hours to get emergency help.'

Following the storm on June 10, Mr Hyland took photos of the patterns that the lightning strike had left in the ground.

Close encounter: 'I didn't see a flash or feel any static electricity that people say they feel when lightning strikes - we just heard an enormous explosion,' said Mr Hyland. Above, the area the bolt hit, featuring several 'patterns'

Aftermath: This close-up picture of where the lightning bolt struck shows hail scattered across the ground

'It created these unique patterns about 15-20ft away from us that were several inches deep,' he said.

'It was strange because we couldn't see any damage to the tree - but there was so much energy the ground erupted.'

It is not the first time Mr Hyland has had a near-death encounter at the camp site.

Better weather: Shoshone Lake is a backcountry lake that is situated in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming

Calm before the storm: Mr Hyland's friends kayak on the lake on June 10, just hours before the lightning struck

A few years ago, he came face-to-face with a Grizzly bear, but managed to escape unscathed.

'The site is very memorable in terms of experiences - it's quite an intimidating place for me, because I've had a few brushes with nature there now,' he said.

'This strike was a unique experience - you never know what nature will throw at you.'
