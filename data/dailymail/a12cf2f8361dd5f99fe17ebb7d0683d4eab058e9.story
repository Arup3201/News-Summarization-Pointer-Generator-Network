Thousands of mourners poured into the city of Moncton on Monday to honor three Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers killed in last week's shooting spree.

Prior to the funeral for Constables Dave Ross, Douglas Larche and Fabrice Gevaudan, RCMP officers marched through Moncton in a funeral procession. Each officer's casket was driven through the procession in a hearse.

Honoured: RCMP officers wore their famed red uniforms and Stetson hats for the funeral

Onlookers took to the streets to honor the officers, many of whom were dressed in red and white, the colors of the Canadian flag. Many saluted the officers as they marched past and were photographed with tearful expressions.

Governor General David Johnson and his wife Sharon, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, along with thousands of police officers attended the funeral.

Mayor George LeBlanc estimated yesterday that between 5,000 and 7,000 officers would attend.

On Tuesday, the city shut down public transportation and offered nine other sites for mourners to gather during the ceremony because of the large crowds estimated. Three books of condolences are also available for well-wishers to sign in City Hall.

Assistant commissioner Roger Brown gave a eulogy honoring the three soldiers.

'I am so fortunate we have over 1,200 (police) employees in our beautiful province and with the eyes of the nation upon us today, I wanted to publicly say how incredibly proud I am of each and every one of you.'

'I only wish that I could have told Doug, Dave and Fabrice in person. I will never forget that nor will we. Const. Gevaudan, Const. Ross, Const. Larche, to your post dismissed,' he said.

Daniel Larche, brother of Doug Larche, also spoke.

'Never in my worst nightmare did I envision a stitch in time where I would be one to give his eulogy. I guess it is because Doug was in the prime of his life, invincible, and it never occurred to me that I could one day have to worry about this. Certainly not now, not for another 50 years,' he said.

'I always assumed that we were going to get old and retire together.… I want him back so badly that I can tell him one more time that I love him and I’m proud of the great man he has become.'

Among the speakers was Geoffrey McLatchie, who was close with the Gevaudan family.

'(Fabrice) had the RCMP family of which he was innately proud. He loved being a member of the RCMP family, he cherished each day that he went to work, to work in the community to be part of the community to be a protector to the community,' he said.

Prime Minister David Harper also spoke at the ceremony and condemned the shooting that took the officers' lives.

'All of you, families, are in our thoughts and prayers,' he said. 'Together, we struggle for answers. We ask what in God’s name happened here – and why. We may never know. With three men dead, cut down in their prime - we don’t need a verdict to know that what happened here is an outrage.'

On 
Monday, the caskets of Ross, Larche and Gevaudan were on display inside 
the Wesleyan Celebration Centre for seven hours so visitors could pay 
their respects. They were greeted by six Canadian mounties, with two 
mounties guardian each casket.

Each
 casket was covered in the Canadian flag. On top of each caskets a 
Canadian stetson hat was perched, along with a gun holster.

Next to the caskets were images of the officers in their uniforms, as well as photos of them on the job in Moncton.

Ross,
 Larche and Gevaudan were killed in a shooting spree allegedly committed
 by Justin Bourque, 24. Bourque also allegedly shot and injured two 
other officers, who survived.

Bourque was apprehended by authorities after a 30-hour manhunt that effectively shut Moncton down. He has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder, as well as two counts of attempted murder.
