Google yesterday launched its own social network in an attempt to challenge Facebook with a service that ties together all its existing sites including Gmail.

Google+ is structured in a remarkably similar way to Facebook, with profile pictures and news feeds forming a central core.

However, a user's friends or contacts are grouped into specific 
circles of their choosing - as opposed to the common pool of friends typical on 
Facebook.

Circles of friends: The site is seeking to differentiate itself by letting users divide their friends into 'circles'

Google+ started rolling out to a limited number of users on Tuesday in what the company is calling a field trial.

Only those invited to join will initially be able to use the service. Google did not say when it would be more widely available.

The service does not currently feature advertising.

To create Google+, the company went 
back to the drawing board in the wake of several notable failures, 
including Google Wave and Google Buzz, a micro-blogging service whose 
launch was marred by privacy snafus.

'We learned a lot in Buzz, and one of
the things we learned is that there's a real market opportunity for a 
product that addresses people's concerns around privacy and how their 
information is shared,' said Google spokesman Bradley Horowitz.

Google
drew more than one billion visitors worldwide to its websites in May, 
more than any other company, according to web analytics firm comScore.

But people are spending more time on Facebook - the average U.S. visitor 
spent 375minutes on Facebook in May, compared with 231minutes for 
Google.

Google+ seems designed to make its 
online properties a pervasive part of the daily online experience, 
rather than being spots where web surfers occasionally check in to 
search for a website or check email.

As
with Facebook's service, Google+ has a central web page that displays 
an ever-updating stream of the comments, photos and links being shared 
by friends and contacts.

A
toolbar across the top of most of Google's sites - such as its main 
search page, its Gmail site and its Maps site - allows users to access 
their personalised data feed. They can then contribute their own 
information to the stream.

Google+ will also offer a special video chat feature, in which up to ten people can jump on a conference call.

And Google will automatically store 
photos taken on mobile phones on its Internet servers, allowing a 
Google+ user to access the photos from any computer and share them.

Expansion: Chief executive Larry Page is keen to build Google's social networking presence

Google chief executive Larry Page has
made social networking a top priority at the world's number one 
Internet search engine, whose position as the main gateway to online 
information could be at risk as people spend more time on sites such as 
Facebook and Twitter.

Enticing consumers to join another 
social networking service will not be easy, said Rory Maher, an analyst 
with Hudson Square Research.

'They're
going to have an uphill battle due to Facebook's network effects,' said
Maher, citing the 700million users that some research firms say are 
currently on Facebook's service.

'The more users they (Facebook) get, the harder it gets for Google to steal those,' he said.

But he added that Google's popularity in web search and email could help it gain a following.

To set its service apart from 
Facebook, Google is betting on what it says is a better approach to 
privacy -- a hot-button issue that has burned Facebook, as well as 
Google, in the past.

Central to Google+ are the 'circles' 
of friends and acquaintances. Users can organise contacts into different
customized circles - family members, co-workers, college friends - and 
share photos, videos or other information only within those groups.

'In
the online world there's this 'share box' and you type into it and you 
have no idea who is going to get that, or where it's going to land, or 
how it's going to embarrass you six months from now,' said Mr Horowitz.

'For us, privacy isn't buried six panels deep,' he added.

Facebook,
which has been criticised for its confusing privacy controls, 
introduced a feature last year that lets users create smaller groups of 
friends.

Google, 
without mentioning Facebook by name, said other social networking 
services' attempts to create groups have been 'bolt-on' efforts that do 
not work as well.

Facebook did not comment on Google's new social networking service.
