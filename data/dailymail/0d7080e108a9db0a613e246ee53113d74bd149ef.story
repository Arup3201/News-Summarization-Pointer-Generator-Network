The Duchess of Cambridge is widely thought to be Britain's most popular royal - but can she compete on a global scale? According to new reports, perhaps not. 

Denmark's Crown Princess Mary, an Australian native, is the most stylish royal dresser of all; beating the Duchess of Cambridge into second place, a startling new poll has revealed.

Also popular were Jordan's elegant Queen Rania, Spain's journalist-turned-princess Letizia, and Sweden's newly married Princess Madeleine.

Other royals that proved popular with style critics included Monaco's Princess Charlene, Zara Phillips, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands and Norwegian crown princess, Mette-Marit.

But despite their best efforts, Crown Princess Mary, 41, took the title with 68per cent of the vote thanks to a wardrobe crammed with Danish design and an elegant approach to wearing it.

The poll, which was conducted by myvouchercodes.co.uk, also found that 67per cent of respondents found Mary's style 'inspiring'.

Like the Duchess of Cambridge, Mary's stellar style has several fashion blogs dedicated to tracking her every sartorial move, providing information on what she wears and where to get it.

Commoner to royalty: Born in Hobart, the Queen-in-waiting (pictured with husband, Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and two children, Princess Isabella and Prince Christian) is nicknamed Australia's Princess

Bold choices: Her elegant dresses and clever use of color have made Princess Mary popular with fashion critics and royal fans

Pants perfect: The royal's defined sense of style, as well as her affinity for sharp tailoring, keeps her ahead of the style stakes

Off-duty style: Even relaxing in the sun at a Sydney performance, Princess Mary looks chic is an oversize sun hat and crisp white dress

Currently proving popular with fans is 
the cream Prada bag and shoes she sported during a dinner at Copenhagen 
restaurant, Geist, with her friend Caroline Fleming last week.

Born in Hobart, Australia, as Mary Donaldson, the Queen-in-waiting (once her husband, Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, inherits the throne), is often compared to the Duchess of Cambridge - with her relationship termed a 'modern-day fairy tale.'

She famously met Prince Frederik at a pub in Sydney, when he was visiting Australia during the 2000 Summer Olympics. 

The couple's official engagement in 2003, and
 their marriage the following year, received extensive 
attention from Australian news media - portrayed as a
'fairytale' romance between royalty and a commoner.

Classic style with a twist: On her wedding day in 2003, Princess Mary worn an ivory duchess satin dress made by Danish designer Uffe Frank, and opted out of wearing a tiara

Ten years later: The stylish couple attend a dinner at the National Museum in Amsterdam hosted by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands earlier this year

But
 there is no doubt her fashion instincts are impeccably regal. She is 
often spotted in Danish designers, such as Ole 
Lynggaard or Jesper Hovring, and she continues to solidify her fashion status as one of Vanity Fair’s best dressed royals.

And like the Duchess of Cambridge, 
Princess Mary is often spotted wearing the same item over several occasions.

Recently, she was photographed in a repeat Rabens Saloner blouse at a Fri for Mobberi
 [Free from Bullying] event organized by her charitable foundation, which she has worn on several occasions since 2009.

While the Danish princess doesn't have 
quite the impact on retail as the Duchess of Cambridge, failing to move clothes at sell-out rates, it seems her style 
is beginning to make an impact on British dress sense.

Sixty-two per cent 
of Brits admitted that they would consider buying an item that Princess Mary had
 been photographed wearing.

And although the Duchess of Cambridge missed out on the top spot, it wasn't all bad news for stylish British royals.

Zara Phillips made it into eighth 
place, while Princess Diana was voted the most stylish royal of all time
 with an overwhelming 82 per cent of the vote.

Fashion favorite: Like the Duchess of Cambridge, Mary's stellar style has several fashion blogs dedicated to tracking her every sartorial move, providing information on what she wears and where to get it

Unfortunately,
 the wooden spoon prize went to her nieces, Beatrice and Eugenie, with five and three per cent respectively - behind 
Germany's Princess Elisabeth von Thurn und Taxis and another Dane, Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark.

'I was genuinely surprised by the 
results, as I think that many would assume that everyone’s favourite 
royal style icon would be Kate,' said Mark Pearson, Chairman of myVoucherCodes.co.uk. 'Judging by the results, it seems that 
Kate has a bit of competition.

'As both women are 
incredibly stylish, with Mary opting regularly for Malene Birger and 
Kate wearing anything from Topshop, Hobbs and even L.K. Bennett shoes; 
it is no wonder that the two women were really popular with the British 
public.'

Glamorous: The Duchess of Cambridge was narrowly beaten with 67%  and Queen Rania of Jordan came third

Also-rans: Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie came last, while the Countess of Wessex was nowhere to be seen

Stunning: Princess Charlene of Monaco came sixth

Beauty: Spain's Princess Letizia narrowly missed out

Popular: No nonsense Zara Phillips was in eighth place

Although the seriously stylish Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark and Princess Mathilde of Belgium narrowly missed out, they did have some tough competition as the top 10 reveals:

1. Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark - 68 per cent

2. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge - 67 per cent

3. Queen Rania of Jordan - 61 per cent

4. Letizia, Princess of Asturias - 59 per cent

5. Madeleine, Princess of Sweden - 56 per cent

6. Charlene, Princess of Monaco - 52 per cent

7. Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden - 47 per cent

8. Zara Philips - 45 per cent

10. Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway - 33 per cent
