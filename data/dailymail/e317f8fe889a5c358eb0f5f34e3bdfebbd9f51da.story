A probe has been launched after a  passenger jet flew from  New York to Stockholm despite four cabin crew members refusing to fly because they felt it was unsafe to take off in a snowstorm.

The Norwegian Airlines flight with 196 passengers on board arrived safely in Stockholm on January 26 after cabin staff were reportedly involved in a heated argument with the pilot at John F Kennedy Airport in New York.

Four of the nine cabin crew refused to fly, leaving just five staff on board the plane for the transatlantic crossing. 

New York airports, including JFK, have been hit by hug amounts of snow over the past month 

The American crew members, who have since been suspended while an investigation is conducted, allegedly disobeyed the captain citing safety concerns during the snowstorm that had engulfed much of the eastern US. 

According to Swedish newspaper Expressen.se some flights had been cancelled on the date due to heavy now accumulating on plane wings.

Norway's Civil Aviation Authority Luftfartstilsynet confirmed the airline is investigating the incident and is expected to produce a report on findings.

A spokesperson for the authority told MailOnline Travel the minimum number of crew for that flight from New York should have been seven.

The director of operations for Luftfartstilsynet Einar Schjolberg was also quoted in local media as saying the incident was a breach of regulations and unacceptable.

However, Tomas Hesthammer, Norwegian's head of flight operations, told Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet that the legal minimum for a flight of 196 passengers is five crew.

Mr Hesthammer told press: 'Norwegian made the Norwegian CAA aware of the incident immediately. At the same time, an internal investigation was started. 

'What seems clear is that the four cabin crew chose not to follow the captain’s orders, and eventually left the plane. This is extremely unusual and it is very serious when cabin crew doesn’t obey the captain’s orders. 

'It is he or she who has a full overview of the flight, weather conditions, etc in accordance with the Aviation Act, the captain is given great authority in relation to making decisions on board.'

He added: 'The flight to Arlanda was a perfectly normal flight despite fewer cabin crew members on board than usual. It is correct that the captain chose to fly with five cabin crew. 

'Flying with five cabin crew is not in line with an order which was given one month previously as a result of an EASA recommendation. It is in other words not a law to date, however, this is something we’re obviously in dialogue with the CAA about. 

'The captain's decision to fly with five cabin crew, with 196 passengers, satisfies the basic requirement of having one cabin crew per 50 passengers. The investigation and our dialogue with the CAA will clarify what further actions will be taken.' 

Passenger Lii Hylander told Sweden's Expressen.se the pilot had been 'calm and collected' explaining to passengers that they would take off despite only having half the cabin staff.

She said: 'Once we were in the air, the flight went just fine.'
