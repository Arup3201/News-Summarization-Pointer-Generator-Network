This was the moment a rare and unique echidna breeding ritual was caught on camera at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. 

These super cute five echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters, were captured taking part in what is known as 'trailing'.

Female echidna Spike released a hormone called pheromone that attracted her boyfriend Rex along with his other friends Gman, Thorne and Lynx.

The echidnas can follow each round for up to 10 hours a day over several days in the breeding ritual 

Echinda keeper Brett Finlayson said 'it's a mystery' why the females take the males on such a long journey 

The boys spent a week and a half following Spike around the enclosure before she finally selected which male and she wanted to mate with, and luckily for him Rex was chosen last month. 

Echinda keeper Brett Finlayson told Daily Mail Australia says once the echidnas mate there is a 90 per cent chance of pregnancy. 

He said: 'We are hoping Spike might have laid an egg because she has gone underground. 

'This behaviour is also very rare and I believe we might have been the first zoo to capture the footage in the world.' 

Keepers at Taronga Zoo in Mosman have high hopes for Spike because the last puggle to be born and survive was Pitpa and she was born in 1987. 

Mr Finlayson said Pitpa did give birth to a puggle two years ago but it sadly died very young.

If Spike does fall pregnant it will take her 21 days after mating to lay an egg and she will push the egg into the pouch. 

Experts don't know why the echidnas follow one another in the 'bumper to bumper style' 

In the wild, female echidnas can have up to 10 male echidnas following behind them in the breeding process

It will take another 10 days till the egg breaks and the baby will lick on the mum's rich secreted milk. 

Despite being an Australian icon mystery still surrounds why the echindas when it comes to their unique mating rituals. 

Once the females release their hormone the male echidnas suddenly start trailing behind the female bumper-to-bumper style, all in a line.

Mr Finlayson says the zoo keepers call it 'echinda train' where the group follow one another round nose to bum trying to mate with the female. 

'It's a mystery why echidna females find their mate by taking them on an arduous journey through the bush. They're a bit of an enigma.

These echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters, were captured taking part in what is known as 'trailing'

'One theory is that the males trail the female until she eventually grows tired and stops walking. 

'She will then accept the first male in line as a mate.

'Another thought is that the female recognises the compatibility of the male through smell. It's possible that she is waiting for the right male to be directly behind her.

'It's not necessarily the strongest but the smartest who wins the opportunity to breed.' 

In the wild, female echidnas can have up to 10 male echidnas following behind them.

Taronga Zoo echinda keeper Brett Finlayson said: 'They're a bit of an enigma' 

Taronga currently has four females and five males involved in a breeding program. 

The echindas, which live on average to about 40 years old, only breed during winter- June to September- and their breeding intensifies on the winter soltace on June 21, according to Mr Finlayson who has worked with them for 12 years. 

He added: 'It is notoriously hard to breed echidna offspring in human care, with only approximately 25 echidnas ever bred, and nearly all of those were in the last 10 years. 

'They have grabbed me, they are intelligent, fascinating and a pleasure to work with, Pitpa is my favourite.' 

A zoo spokesman said: 'Echidnas are not endangered in the wild, however loss of habitat has contributed to reduce the distribution of echidnas in Australia.

'It's important that keepers continue to try to breed echidnas in the event that numbers in the wild become critically low.'
