Council bosses have ordered a town on 
Yorkshire to take down home-knitted Tour de France bunting after 
claiming the weight of the wool was causing streetlights to bend.

Residents
 from Masham, in the Yorkshire Dales, spent months knitting more than 
20,000 jerseys in the Tour's signature colours of yellow, green and 
white with red dots to hang between lamp-posts.

But yesterday workers arrived from North
 Yorkshire County Council to taken them down, because officials worried the metal poles were 'leaning' under the weight of the wool after it got 
wet.

Council workers have forced residents in Mashman, Yorkshire, to take down bunting they knitted to celebrate the Tour de France after claiming it was bending the lamp-posts

Officials complained that the metal poles were 'leaning' under the weight of the bunting after it got wet, so residents have been told to had it on buildings or trees instead

Tessa Klemz, 45, Manager of Mashamshire Community Office, said: 'It’s health and safety gone bananas.

'Sheep don’t fall over when they get wet. If the lamp posts are that flimsy and fragile they need looking at.

'They have been there for years and we don’t think a few jerseys - that weigh nothing - are going to make any difference.

“We
 have not seen any bending at all and we have had more than our share of
 rain. We did not want it to end up in a corner of some council 
building.

'So we have taken 
the bunting back and it is hanging from guttering, windows, and the 
doorways and arches of houses without any problems.

'You would think the council has better things to spend our money on.'

Harrogate Borough Council asked residents to knit woolen jerseys in November last year to hang around nearby villages as the tour passed through, and received entries from as far afield as Canada and Bermuda.

After the entries were collected, Masham was given 40 metres of the bunting to hang from half a dozen 20ft tall lamp posts in the market square.

But North Yorkshire County council, who are charged with taking care of streetlights in the town, overruled them and demanded the decorations be taken down.

A county council spokesman said: 'The council is fully supportive of putting up 
bunting to celebrate Yorkshire’s hosting of the Grand Depart of the Tour
 de France.

'Indeed, the 
authority is distributing four kilometres of bunting to schools, council
 buildings and libraries along the Tour route to support the festivities
 for this fantastic event.

'Following
 Harrogate Borough Council’s erection of bunting in Masham we noticed 
that the lighting columns were leaning and in the interest of safety we 
asked the council to take them down as a matter of some urgency.

'We welcome bunting on buildings, or between trees, but it cannot be hung between lampposts for the safety reasons.'

Jack
 Hart, of The Freedom Association, said: 'The Tour de France visiting 
the UK is an opportunity for us to show our community spirit at its 
best.

'Yet again it appears
 that a local council is ignoring the excitement of local residents in 
favour of an over-zealous approach to health and safety.

'The
 fact that local residents have taken the time to create home-made 
bunting in order to decorate their town and welcome the Tour de France 
should have been celebrated by the council, not criticised.

'Local
 residents want their town to look its best, given it will have the 
world’s attention on it. It’s such a shame the council has chosen to act
 in such a nonsensical way.'

The Tour de France begins in Leeds on 5 July with the first stage travelling to Harrogate via the Yorkshire Dales and a second stage on the 6 July from York to Sheffield.

The Tour will begin in Leeds on July 5 this year before travelling to Harrogate via the Yorkshire Dales, where it will pass through Masham (pictured, Bradley Wiggins wears the race's signature yellow jersey)

Bonkers: A primary school in Cumbria told pupils that they needed to wear goggles if they wanted to play with conkers

Other cases of bizarre health and safety policies include a local council in Scotland which banned a dog training club over allergy fears.

The club, which had been running in a community hall for 60 years, was banned because the council claimed that those using the hall next door might be allergic to dogs or catch a disease from the pets.

In June last year, a mother in Gloucester was told by the headteacher that her seven-year-old daughter was no longer allowed to wear her homemade frilly socks because they could become a tripping hazard.

Meanwhile in Derbyshire, small wooden canes protecting daffodil bans were pulled out of the ground in case someone tripped over them and fell into a flowerbed.

A primary school in Cumbria told pupils that they needed to wear goggles - if they wanted to play with conkers at school.

The rule came after the local council attempted to ban children from playing conkers in the playground.

In 2012, a Santa was not allowed to ride his float in Sutton - despite the tradition being around for decades.

The ban was imposed after health and safety assessments found the sleigh too dangerous, instead Father Christmas had to walk alongside his sleigh

In 2008, children were banned from taking part in a sack race in Durham because teachers feared they would hurt themselves. Instead pupils was asked to run or skip.

A town council near Manchester created a policy preventing loose flowers and pots being placed on graves.
