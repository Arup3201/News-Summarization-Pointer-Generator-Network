British heavy metal band Iron Maiden —  responsible for uncompromising songs such as  The Number Of The Beast and Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter — are getting ready for yet another world tour.

The grizzled old veterans will criss-cross Europe in the spring and summer, before playing North and South America in the autumn. And in between these commitments, the band have announced they are releasing a beer called Trooper Ale. In collaboration with Cheshire brewery Robinsons, they plan to release Trooper, named after another of their songs, on May 9.

The response has been colossal — more than 100 countries have asked to stock Trooper, and 300,000 pints are on pre-order. The brewery reports that it is at full tilt six days a week in an attempt to keep up with demand, and brewing three batches a day for the first time in its 175-year history.

It’s a triumph for lead singer Bruce 
Dickinson, who is a fan of traditional English cask beer, as he was the 
one who helped formulate the recipe for a beer with ‘citrus notes’ and 
4.7 per cent alcohol.

Heavy metal: Bruce Dickinson is Iron Maiden's lead singer. The band has sold 85million albums

But 
then Dickinson is accustomed to success: Iron Maiden, routinely ignored 
by music critics, have an enormous global fan base, and have played more
 than 2,000 gigs since their early Eighties heyday. They’ve also sold 
85 million albums.

And they
 have in Dickinson, their front man since 1981, one of the most 
extraordinary figures in the rock world. For he is a polymath who has 
turned out to be brilliant at almost anything he turns his hand to, and 
that now includes making beer.

On stage he wears tight trousers, ghoulish head-dresses and sleeveless Gothic T-shirts. In normal life, he is Renaissance Man in leather who has been a foil fencer at the highest level, once ranked seventh in Britain, and was invited to join the UK Olympic team.

He is an accomplished commercial pilot, and has run an airline. He has also written a couple of novels — just for fun.

Today, he runs an aircraft 
maintenance company in Wales. And he is an investor in a project to 
create an unmanned Zeppelin spy airship for the U.S. government, at a 
cost of up to £500 million.

And
 all the time, of course, he has been the lynch-pin of Iron Maiden, one 
of the most influential bands in rock history. As he says: ‘Where else 
can a 54-year-old still run around in a jockstrap and tights and not get
 arrested?’ 

The son of an 
Army mechanic, Dickinson was born in 1958 in Worksop, and brought up in 
Sheffield. At first he was raised by his grandparents — his mother 
having fallen pregnant at 16. But at four, his father felt he was 
making enough money to support a child, and he moved in with his parents 
again. His father ran a boarding house, and later sold cars.

As
 a teenager, he was sent to board at Oundle public school, near 
Peterborough, which he hated. He says that he was picked on because of 
his northern accent and working-class roots. However the school helped 
to feed his interests — in planes, submarines and rockets. He also 
became seriously interested in fencing.

High demand: More than 300,000 pints of Trooper have already been pre-ordered

He recalls that his metalwork teacher
 happened to be an amateur fencing coach, and he started teaching him — 
sparking a lifelong passion for the sport.

However,
 he was expelled from Oundle after boiling up some of his own urine and 
pouring it on to his headmaster’s plate of mange-touts as a prank. He 
explained in an interview: ‘I knew it wouldn’t harm him. I’d done a bit 
of chemistry.’

He 
considered a career in the Army, but instead started a degree in modern 
history at Queen Mary College in London. He was a fan of Black Sabbath 
and Deep Purple and began to sing in a band, Samson. In 1981 he was 
approached by Iron Maiden to come on board. They were in need of a lead 
singer. Paul Di’Anno, the incumbent, had developed a crippling fondness 
for cocaine.

Di’Anno 
commented: ‘It wasn’t just that I was snorting a bit of coke; I was just
 going for it non-stop 24 hours a day every day. The band had 
commitments piling up and I just couldn’t see my way to the end of it.’

Multi-talented: Dickinson is also a highly ranked foil fencer and was once asked to join the British Olympic Team

Dickinson didn’t really go in for such excesses. He said that he drank a lot of vodka, and slept with lots of girls, and smoked a bit of dope, but that was it.

And while some heavy metal bands make excessive demands for lavish amounts of food and alcohol to be available backstage, on a recent tour, the ‘rider’ for Iron Maiden featured only red wine, a loaf of bread and some tuna, so they could make sandwiches — modest indeed.

Not for them the drug-induced madness of Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath. That’s not to say there haven’t been Spinal Tap moments. On one tour they enacted an onstage mock-sacrifice of a cage full of supposed vestal virgins.

But Dickinson claims: ‘We’ve always had an acute awareness of our own absurdity.’ 

By his own account, his lowest point came during a tour of Japan when he found himself crawling along a hotel corridor in Tokyo, blind drunk and ravenous, desperately searching for leftover food on discarded room-service trays.

‘Afterwards, I just thought: “There’s got to be more than this.” That’s when I took up fencing again and decided to learn how to fly.’

The pinnacle of his fencing career 
came when his local club won the National Team Championship in 1989. He 
was ranked seventh in the UK that year. 

As
 he said: ‘I think the best way to find out about something is to try to
 do it to the max. A lot of people take up a hobby or sport and then 
find an excuse not to carry on with it. Once I start something, I won’t 
stop until I’m as good at it as I’ll ever be.’

Dickinson
 wanted to fly a plane from the age of five and qualified as a 
commercial pilot in 1998 during a break from Iron Maiden (he left in 
1993 and went back in 1999). He has flown around 500 hours a year ever 
since for a number of commercial airlines. He also flies Iron Maiden on 
their tours.

Last year 
he launched Cardiff Aviation, a maintenance, repair and overhaul company
 in a hangar in an old RAF base. He is well regarded in the business, 
and was the keynote speaker at Lufthansa’s 50th anniversary symposium.

He also has a stake in Hybrid Air 
Vehicles, a Bedfordshire-based company, which last year won a 
£500million contract with the US defence department to build a ‘long 
endurance, multi-intelligence vehicle’ — an unmanned spy airship.

Planes
 run out of gas after about 18 hours, but this thing can sit at 20,000ft
 and look down on the bad guys for three weeks,’ he explains. ‘What 
we’ve got here is the rebirth of the British airship.’Today,
 he lives in Chiswick, West London, with his wife Paddy, a photographer,
 and their three children Austin, 15, Griffin, 13, and Kia, 11. He likes
 to joke that they were all home births and he served ‘as the wicket 
keeper’.

The one recent controversy he has suffered seems to have been at the hands of another unstoppable monster of rock, Sharon Osbourne. 

When Iron Maiden played the Ozzfest heavy metal festival in California in 2005 they were pelted with bottle tops, lighters and eggs by Black Sabbath fans, and there were suspicions that someone also interfered with their sound.

Not long before the concert, Dickinson had made comments about reality television being ‘a complete disgrace — freak-show television, the lowest of the low.’

Sharon Osbourne, who had allowed cameras into her home to film her family for fly-on-the-wall documentary The Osbournes, later admitted that she had personally cut Iron Maiden’s sound several times, and that the egg pelting had been sanctioned by her.

‘I did cut the band’s sound,’ she said. ‘Ozzfest is our tour. Dickinson doesn’t have the manners to realise that when you are invited into someone’s home, are seated at their dinner table, are eating their food and drinking their wine, you shouldn’t talk disrespectfully about them.

‘Dickinson got what he deserved. We had to listen to his b******t for five straight weeks. He only had to suffer a couple of eggs on the head.’

He later said: ‘One big lesson I’ve learned is that you cross Sharon Osbourne at your peril.’

There are some obstacles, it seems, which even this remarkable polymath cannot overcome.
