Thousands of mobile users across the country could not send or receive calls or texts tonight after O2's network crashed

Mobile phone operator O2 could face a huge compensation bill after a meltdown in its network cut off millions of customers.

Voice calls and text messages, as 
well as access to emails and the internet, were blocked as parts of 
Britain’s second biggest network collapsed on Wednesday and yesterday.

The firm said ‘the problem was due to
a fault with one of our network systems, which meant some mobile phone 
numbers were not registering correctly on our network’.

It claimed the system had been fixed and was working normally by late yesterday afternoon.

But with the Olympics about to put a 
strain on mobile phone networks, with a huge influx of visitors using 
smartphones to take and send pictures and video and to access the 
internet, the failure raised serious questions about how robust the 
system is.

The O2 collapse triggered enormous frustration for individual customers and businesses.

There were reports that one family 
had difficulties contacting loved ones to alert them to the imminent 
death of an elderly relative.

Parts of London’s bicycle hire scheme, sponsored by Barclays, failed because the card payment system is linked to O2’s network.

Some Tesco Mobile customers, who also
use the O2 system, lost services. O2, which is owned by Spain’s 
Telefonica, has 23million customers in the UK and many took to Twitter 
to vent their frustration.

Celebrities adding to the avalanche 
of criticism included socialite Jemima Khan, newsreader Huw Edwards, 
actress Kym Marsh and footballer Joleon Lescott.

Coronation Street actress Kym March and socialite Jemima Khan both vented their frustration on Twitter at the network crash. Mrs Khan had only changed to the network on the day it went down

Statement: The network, which has around 23 million customers in the UK said the problems began at around 1.30pm and are continuing into the evening

Edwards complained: ‘19 hours and 
counting #O2’, while Lescott said: ‘Bet if I was late paying my bill O2 
would have something to say.’ Miss Khan said she had joined O2 yesterday
only to find she could not use her phone.

Miss Marsh wrote: ‘Anyone else having a problem with 02?

‘This is ridiculous now @o2 been without service for over 6 hours! Important business calls being missed.’

Mother-to-be Leanna May wrote: ‘I 
can’t bear this any longer! THREE @o2 contracts, NONE WORK. And I’m at 
home pregnant in agony! Great, who should I call? No one!’ 

Sean Foster tweeted: ‘Arrrrrrrghhhhh! My phone was fine yesterday and now after their failed overnight work O2 have screwed it!’

The consumer group Which? urged those who lost service to log any costs they incurred to claim compensation.

Message: The O2 website posted an update last night saying their engineers were dealing with the problems

The watchdog’s executive director 
Richard Lloyd said: ‘We want to see O2 offer compensation to all 
customers who have been hugely inconvenienced by this service blackout 
and have been paying for a service they cannot use.’

O2 said: ‘Now that our full network service has resumed, we remain focused on identifying the root cause of the incident.

‘For those customers affected by the lack of service, we will be doing everything we can to make it up to them in an O2 way.’

Telecoms analyst Steven Hartley said the outage raised concerns about the Olympics’ impact on Britain’s communications systems.

Confusion: A spokesman for the company, which has headquarters (pictured) in Slough, Berkshire, admitted it did not know what was causing the problems or when they would be fixed
