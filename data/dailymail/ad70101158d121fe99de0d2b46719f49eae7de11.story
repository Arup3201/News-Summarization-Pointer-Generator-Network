The father of one of the teenagers who is believed dead after falling in the ice last night thinks that his son ‘died a horrible death.’

While officials haven’t publically identified the body pulled from Budd Lake on Tuesday afternoon, Clyde Schimanski Jr. believes his son to be dead and imagined the sheer terror his son must have suffered knowing death was coming.

The father of Clyde Schimanski III told the Star-Ledger: ‘Imagine screaming and knowing you’re going to die. He died a horrible death.’

The grief-stricken father 
added that somehow, his son’s death was part of God’s plan. ‘God works 
in mysterious ways,’ Mr Schimanski Jr. said.

Residents of Mount Olive, New Jersey wrote their condolences for Clyde and Nick Ciancotto on Facebook.

Friends said that Nick and Clyde had 
planned to go ice fishing Monday morning. Residents say that the lake is
a common hang-out and recreational area in the winter.

However, at a press conference held 
earlier after this afternoon, officials would only say that they had 
been tirelessly searching for two teenagers who had fallen through the 
ice around 6:20pm last night.

The operation changed from a rescue mission to a recovery effort Tuesday morning, officials said.

The two teenagers disappeared beneath
the ice of Budd Lake around 6:20pm yesterday evening. Witnesses said 
they heard desperate cries for help.

Though rescue workers searched for hours in the black waters of the lake, they did not find the teens.

According to the Daily Record, first responders broke through more than 100 feet of ice yesterday evening in attempts to find the two people.

Firefighters, state police, and cold water divers all assisted in the rescue effort.

A State Police helicopter flew overhead 
shining light into the black waters of the lake before the search was 
eventually called off.

Some witnesses said that they initially heard screams when the young adults, reported to be ages 14 and 15, fell through.

Bartender Christine Stanat told the Hackettstown Patch that she heard one of them yelling, ‘Help, help, don’t let me die!’

William
Hardy, 25, and his roommate also heard the screams. They had been 
smoking outside of their house, which is on the banks of the lake.

Hardy told the Star-Ledger that he called the police, grabbed a flashlight, and then ran out onto the ice to see how he could help.

The
New Jersey resident went around 700ft out onto the ice before he heard 
it began cracking beneath his weight. Hardy said he saw a blue light 
that could have come from a cell phone.

'It hurts my heart. Until they pull him out, I'll…hold tight. I want to know they find him.'

He,
too, heard the teenagers saying they don’t want to die. Assuring them 
that help was on the way, Hardy watched as the blue light vanished and 
the voices fell silent.

An official confirmed that the two were a great distance from shore. A later report from MyFoxNY said that one of the boys, Clyde, had ridden his bicycle out to rescue the first boy who fell in.

His father, Clyde Schimanski, Jr. 
told the station that his son saw another person fall through the ice 
into the water below and tried to rescue him.

Rescue effort: First responders, including cold water divers, scoured Budd Lake in northern New Jersey for hours last night

Collective effort: Police, EMS, and firefighters all joined in to find the missing teens; search efforts continue today to recover their bodies

Rescue: Initial reports said that a body was pulled from the water last night; these reports were later deemed to be erroneous

Collaborative effort: Rescue workers from neighboring towns rushed to the scene to offer aid

‘Clyde went to save him on his 
bicycle. And then they both went in,’ he said. ‘He was a very good 
child. I’m going to miss him a lot.’

Speaking with MyFoxNY, Mr Schimanski Jr. said that he ‘knows there is no hope.’

‘It hurts my heart,’ the grief-stricken father said. ‘Until they pull him out, I’ll…hold tight. I want to know they find him.’

Last
night, Mount Olive Mayor Robert Greenbaum said that he believed the two
boys, both students at Mount Olive High School, were ice fishing. 'The 
lake is not guarded in any way,' he said.

The mayor later posted a status update on his Facebook page speaking of the grief that had likely come to the New Jersey community.

He wrote: ‘Once again I am sad to report that we likely lost two young adults in Mount Olive this evening. May God bless their families and help ease their pain.’

The mayor added that he was thankful for all of the help received from neighboring towns.

Tragedy: Budd Lake is located in Mount Olive, New Jersey, a small town about 40 miles outside of Newark

There were initial reports last night that a body had been removed from the water, but those reports were today proved to be erroneous. 

The natural lake is often used in the winter for recreational activities like ice skating and ice fishing. At its deepest, it is 12ft. The weather in Mount Olive has been warmer than average this season, with daily highs well above freezing point.

However, area residents said that the lake had been frozen enough for usual wintertime activities such as skating and fishing.
