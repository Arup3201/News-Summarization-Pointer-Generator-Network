Vice President Joe Biden took a little time out during an appearance in Florida to trawl for votes for his own White House bid in 2016.

Biden, who will be 73 in 2016 - nearly three years older than when Ronald Reagan became the oldest man ever first elected president - was in a Sarasota restaurant talking on the telephone to a Republican voter who appeared to be reluctant to back the Obama-Biden ticket next week.

‘Look, I’m not trying to talk you into voting for me, I just wanted to say hi to you,’ he said. ‘And after it's all over, when your insurance rates go down, then you’ll vote for me in 2016. I’ll talk to you later.’

The Vice President speaks on a patron's phone during a visit to the Station 400 restaurant in Sarasota. He was heard by a reporter telling a Republican voter that they would vote for him in 2016

Campaign continues despite the storm: Americans gather to hear the Vice President's speech

Biden, pictured wearing sunglasses, ran for president in 1988 and 2008 but failed to win a single state

The exchange was overheard by a pool reporter.

Biden, wearing aviator sunglasses, had initially taken the phone and said: ‘I’'ll tell you what, you may be a Republican but I love you.’ 

When he became embroiled in a discussion about healthcare reform, a man standing nearby said: ‘I think he met his match.’

Biden, who ran for president in 1988 and
 2008 but failed to win a single state, has repeatedly intimated that he
 wants to run in 2008, despite his advanced age and the fact that he is 
best known for his long-windedness and verbal flubs.

Asked last year by CNN if he was closing the door to another White house bid, he responded that he was ‘not closing anything’.

He added: ‘I wouldn't have run for president in the first place - and I don't think the president would have picked me - unless he thought I'd be good at the job.’

Before he became vice-president, Biden served 36 years in the United States Senate.
