It's still another 116 days till Christmas but one High Street store are ensuring customers can get organised early by already selling festive goods.

Shoppers were shocked to big red stockings and reindeer toys on sale at The Mamas & Papas store in Cardiff this August.

The children's chain also has table full of Christmas presents and gift ideas - even though pupils haven't yet gone back to school after the summer holidays. A spokesman for the retailer said the displays will be going up in their other shops across the UK in the next fortnight.

Deck the halls, already: Mamas&Papas in Cardiff are selling festive products

Father-of-two Barry Evans, 36, said: 'People talk about Christmas coming early but this is ridiculous.

'I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things - August isn't even out yet and they're trying to make us feel all festive.

'Shops seem to start their big Christmas push earlier each year, I think it spoils what's so special about it.

'I don't know how people can think about getting Christmas presents when the children haven't even finished their summer holidays yet.'

The Christmas products were spotted at the Mamas & Papas store at the St David's shopping centre in Cardiff.

The display features teddies, nativity kits and cuddly elves holding candy canes.

Pregnant Caroline Brown, 41, who already has two young boys and has a third on the way, said she was 'appalled' by the festive display.

She said: 'I felt like it was exploiting my children. I walked in to get a push chair and now all my boys have been talking about is Christmas.

'They keep asking how many sleeps is it to go, when Santa is going to come and if they've been good this year.'

Only 116 days to go! A spokesman for the retailer said they wanted to give customers plenty of time to stock up for Christmas

Mamas & Papas, who have more than 60 stores across the UK, specialise in prams, pushchairs, car seats, cots, highchairs, nursery furniture, bedding and toys.

A spokeswoman for the retailer said: 'With us being a parenting store we consider planning a very important thing. We want to give our customers plenty of time to make their choices and budget for what can be a very busy time.

'We are in the process of rolling this out across the UK over the next fortnight.'

But Mamas & Papas aren't the only ones who are feeling the Christmas spirit already.

How lovely our your branches: Christmas lights have been switched on in Tenterden, Kent

A small market town in Kent has already put up and turned on its festive lights.

But the Chamber of Commerce in Tenterden, Kent, have claimed the stunt is just an experiment in a bid to find ways to reduce the running costs of their Christmas celebrations.

Chamber events officer Jonathan Medes said: 'The lights are timed to come on at 9.15pm and go off at 11.30pm. This is a sample tree and if we like it, we can get working on others.'
