Eric Baker has spoken of the 'bitter irony' at surviving war-zoned but losing his leg to an accident in his own home

A Falklands War veteran who survived the Battle of Goose Green has been forced to have his leg amputated after stubbing his toe in a cruel accident at home.

Ex-paratrooper Eric Baker, 67, survived war-zones and left the forces with the rank of colour sergeant following his service in the South Atlantic.

He has spoken of the 'bitter irony' after he was severely injured when he slipped and stubbed his toe on a bed post at his home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

Mr Baker was initially prescribed antibiotics after the accident, but the infection worsened and four weeks later he was still racked with pain and had to be rushed to hospital.

Doctors said Mr Baker had gangrene after breaking a bone in his right foot. The decision was taken to amputate part of his leg to save his life.

He remained in hospital for 10 weeks and had to return later to have a further five inches of his leg removed because the gangrene had continued to spread.

He said: 'As soon as they came in they told me they knew I had gangrene because they could smell it. I went into hospital and within four days they had amputated my leg to below the knee.

'I was at Goose Green and worked my way up through the ranks of the army and became a colour sergeant but now I'm trapped.'

Mr Baker, who at his peak could run a four-minute mile, says he is now a prisoner in his own home until adaptations are carried out to help him.

He has hit out at his local council for failing to carry out the required work despite weeks of waiting.

He added: 'Since January I haven't been able to leave my house, other than to go into hospital. The things I've seen - young blokes being blown up. I saw one of my friends getting shot in the neck three times.

'Now if there was a fire I probably wouldn't make it out alive because I can't get out of my house.'

After initially being given a course of antibiotics, Mr Baker needed 10 weeks in hospital to treat gangrene

Mr Baker, who worked as a plant operator after leaving the army in 1985, is now reliant on help from neighbour Nicola Cheshire and a carer and cleaner who visit regularly.

Pat Higgs, Doncaster Council's assistant director of adult services said his case was now being treated as a priority.

He said: 'I was extremely concerned to hear about this case, which has been brought to my attention.

'I have carried out an immediate investigation and we are contacting Mr Baker to offer out sincere apologies.'

Susan Jordan, chief executive of St Leger Homes, which manages Eric's home, said: 'We take the safety of our customers very seriously and we are working closely with Doncaster Council to make sure the alterations are carried out to Mr Baker's home.'
