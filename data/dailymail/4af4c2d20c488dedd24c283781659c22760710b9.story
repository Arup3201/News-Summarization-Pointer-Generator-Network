Hannah Anderson has braved the cameras once again, thanking her supporters for rallying around her and her father as she copes with the murders of her mother and little brother and her kidnapping by a close family friend. 

Hannah, 16, appeared noticeably nervous around the camera as she made an appearance Saturday at a car wash organized in her hometown of Lakeside, California, by her high school friends to raise money to help her cope with her ordeal. 

Her father revealed that 'ever moment' is a struggle for the girl, who was rescued just last week from 40-year-old James DiMaggio, who kidnapped her and took her 1,000 miles from her home to the Idaho wilderness.

'Thank you': Hannah Anderson, 16, made her second public appearance since she was freed to attend a car wash being held to raise money for her. She said she wanted to thank everyone was who helping her

Her appearance was brief and it was clear that she wasn't entirely comfortable being followed by the camera from KNSD-TV. However, she did offer thanks to her supporters when asked

When asked by KNSD-TV if she had any words for her friends and supporters in the community she responded: 'Just, thank you.'

Her father told the TV station that his daughter is still learning to cope with the trauma she endured.

'Right now, she just wanted to come out and thank these people personally,' Brett Anderson said.

'It's very difficult. Every moment is difficult for her.'

Police said they consider Hannah 'a victim of every sense of the word' after she was rescued last week from an encampment in the remote River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho after FBI agents shot dead her captor - 40-year-old James DiMaggio.

DiMaggio was a trusted family friend, who Hannah and her eight-year-old brother Ethan referred to as 'Uncle Joe.'

Police say he lured Hannah's mother Christine and her brother Ethan to his home and then bound, tortured and killed them. He then shot the family dog before burning his house down.

On Friday, sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell reiterated previous statements made by Sheriff Bill Gore, who unequivocally said that Hannah ‘was not a willing participant.'

Murdered: Hannah's mother Christine and eight-year-old brother Ethan were tortured to death and murdered by Hannah's kidnapper James DiMaggio

Hannah Anderson was spotted sneaking into a fundraiser being held for her dead relatives on Thursday

Make way: The 16-year-old was ushered into a back door of the Lakeside, California restaurant where community members had gathered to help raise money for funeral costs

Suddenly silent: Hannah did not speak on Thursday and she has set all of her social media accounts to private

‘As Sheriff Gore said earlier in the week, Hannah is a victim in every sense of the word,’ Caldwell said in an email to the Los Angeles Times. ‘Our follow-up investigation has not changed that sentence.’

On Thursday, Anderson stepped out in public for the first time since she was rescued by federal agents less than a week ago.

The
16-year-old wore sunglasses, a blue top and short jean shorts as she 
attended a fundraiser with friends and supporters in Lakeside, 
California less than a week after her ordeal ended.

It
comes as questions remain over what exactly happened when she was 
kidnapped by James 'Uncle Jim' DiMaggio, a family friend who killed her 
mother and 8-year-old brother before abducting her and taking her to 
Idaho where FBI officers shot him dead.

Many
questions remain about the timeline of events on the day when Christina
and Ethan Anderson were killed: why did Hannah exchange 13 calls with 
DiMaggio in the hours leading up to the attack? How exactly were they 
killed? And how was DiMaggio able to restrain and kill them without 
Hannah knowing before they drove off together?

Police have not explained any of these
issues publicly, but they have released the search warrants filled out 
by investigators at DiMaggio's house, listing pages of evidence that 
they took with them to help piece together his relationship to the 
Andersons- and Hannah in particular.

San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore has been adamant that Hannah was an unwilling victim from start to finish. "I can't make it any clearer," he said at a news conference Monday.

She
has spoken to friends and strangers over social media and released a 
number of pictures of herself via her Instagram account but the first 
time she was seen publicly came Thursday evening when she went to a 
fundraiser for her family.

Her
mother Christina and 6-year-old brother Ethan were killed and their 
bodies were set on fire by their family friend Jim DiMaggio, who 
'tricked' them into coming to his home and then killed the mother and 
brother before running off with Hannah and being shot dead six days 
later.

Hannah was only briefly seen walking from their car into the back entrance of a San Diego restaurant where the fundraiser was being held.

Support: Her father said that she is happy to be home and among friends

Hannah's appearance at the fundraiser comes
the same day as a growing list of evidence recovered at DiMaggio's 
house has been revealed, including firebombs, military assault rifle 
ammunition, and handwritten 'letters from Hanna' to DiMaggio.

One
of the most puzzling pieces added to the ongoing investigation into 
this crime is that a DNA test kit was found in the burnt out car that 
once belonged to Christina Anderson.

NBC News reports
that other items listed in the search warrants released today include 
'crow bars and other weapons, instruments and objects capable of 
inflicting blunt force trauma', as well as bomb-making materials like 
gas cans, various types of duct tape and arson wire.

A
number of personal items that could potentially be used for DNA 
collection were also gathered, including clothing and toothbrushes but 
also used condoms.

The meaning behind the items was not listed, as emergency responders appear to have grabbed as many items as possible on August 5 as they tried to get a better idea of Hannah's relationship with DiMaggio as they were missing.

What remained: Firefighters found the bodies of Christina and Ethan Anderson covered with tarp, showing that they were killed before the fire that burnt down Jim DiMaggio's Boulevard cabin (pictured)

The 13 calls between DiMaggio and Hannah on the day of her abduction remain curious, though San Diego County sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said that they may have been discussing what time she needed to be picked up from cheerleading practice.

Today, Hannah
did not make a statement to the awaiting press, but her father Brett 
Anderson came outside and made a statement, saying that his daughter was
happy to be home.

'She's with her family and of course with some friends and she's just happy to be here,' he said Thursday.

'Hannah sends her love and she keeps moving day by day.'

The fundraiser was largely attended by relatives and friends within their neighborhood, and Mr Anderson cited their strong support as helping them through.

'This is a small community that we're a part of and they really came together... This is how Lakeside rolls,' he said.

He also said that he has spoken with the four horseback riders who spotted Hannah in the Idaho woods with DiMaggio and called police.

'It was a chance encounter but it did save my daughter's life,' he said.

Father turned spokesman: Brett Anderson stepped outside and said a few words, telling how he was so thankful for the national support that helped lead to his daughter's rescue

Spreading the love: Brett said he spoke with the four horsemen who spotted Hannah with DiMaggio and called police, leading to her recovery

The fundraiser came the day after a search warrant revealed that Hannah's mother and brother were both killed and tortured before DiMaggio's cabin set on fire.

A police report that describes the scene that firefighters found when they responded to the call about DiMaggio's cabin being burnt to ashes in Boulevard, California on August 5th.

They found the bodies covered with tarp, and a crowbar lying next to Christina.

When the responders went to the garage to check for more victims, they found the Anderson's deceased dog and noted that it had blood near its head.

The details surrounding the nature of the bodies are scant, but the fact that the humans were draped with tarp before the firefighters got there- and that there was blood coming from the dog's head- implies that they were all killed before the fire ravaged the home.
