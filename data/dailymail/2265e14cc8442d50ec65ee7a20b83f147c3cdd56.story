His exploits on the football pitch are often picture perfect, and now Lionel Messi has been captured by one of Britain's most prominent artists.

The FC Barcelona star is the subject of a new work by Damien Hirst.

The piece, titled Beautiful Messi Spin Painting, will be auctioned next month as part of a campaign to help children in war-torn or poverty-stricken countries into education.

Messi also features in a piece by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami.

The 27-year-old conceded that he is 'not an expert in the world of art' but added: 'I am flattered that two great artists such as Takashi Murakami and Damien Hirst created a work of art with my image.

'I am immensely proud to be part of this creative process whose ultimate beneficiaries will be children in need.

'It is a unique experience. Also, I think that the fusion of art, sport and education is fantastic; all three fields have a lot in common.'

The 1 in 11 initiative is being launched by the FC Barcelona Foundation, Reach Out To Asia (ROTA) and Unicef. Campaigners say that one in 11 children of primary school age are out of school.

Messi said: 'I'm supporting the 1 in 11 campaign because I believe every child has the right to fulfil their potential and realise their dreams. Education is fundamental to this, but millions of children across the world are out of school and not getting the start in life they are entitled to.

'I believe that through sport we can teach values of respect, teamwork and effort, and ultimately inspire children to attend and stay on in school, so they will receive the quality education which will equip them with the skills they need for life.'

Tennis star Serena Williams is also backing the campaign.

She said: 'In many countries we take it for granted that every child has the right to receive a quality education, but '1 in 11' children around the world do not enjoy that right - and without it, may never reach their full potential,' said Williams.

'We need to kick start global progress and get that number down to zero, so every child has the chance to learn.'

Works donated by artists including Hirst and Murakami will be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on February 12. 

The campaign aims to raise funds to extend educational opportunities to marginalised children in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nepal, with the goal of expanding to more countries.
