A policewoman who planned to sue the owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb while investigating a break-in has dropped her claim for damages.

PC Kelly Jones has dropped her pursuit of damages in the hope that 'wider concerns the public may have' can be resolved, the Police Federation said today.

Ms Jones faced controversy last year after she filed a civil claim against the garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, demanding he reimburse the income she lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene.

A statement given by the Federation which represents 124,000 police officers 
said today: 'Contrary to media reports at the time PC Jones was not 
seeking a vast compensation payment, rather she was seeking monies that 
covered the income she had lost as a result of her injury.

'She
will bear the financial loss with a hope that the wider concerns the 
public might have can be resolved by government and the police service 
for the future.

'This case 
raised a very real issue in that police officers find themselves 
financially disadvantaged when injured at work, with no other option 
other than to seek financial redress just as any other employee in any 
other industry would in the same circumstances.'

Ms
Jones filed the claim against Steve Jones, the owner of the Nun's 
Bridges Filling Station earlier this year, claiming he failed to ensure 
she was 'reasonably safe' when after responding to a reported burglary.

Mr
Jones and the officer were checking the outside of the building after 
an alarm had gone off, when she was alleged to have fallen and hurt her 
leg and wrist in August 2012. 

'A victory for common sense': Mr Jones welcomed the news today that WPC Jones is dropping her claim for damages against him

Mr Jones said he was eager to move on from the ordeal which started when Ms Jones tripped on this 6in kerb at the garage in Thetford, Norfolk

The garage owner welcomed today's news describing it as 'a victory for common sense'.

He told Heart Norfolk radio: 'I now wish to move on and concentrate on running my business'.

The Police Federation, which represents members of the police up to the rank of chief inspector in England and Wales, funded the WPC Jones' legal costs last year.

A month after she filed her claim Home Secretary Theresa May told the Federation’s annual conference that she wanted to see an end to 'frivolous' legal claims.

She told delegates: 'I know that the vast majority of you are dedicated public servants of the best kind.

'But when a police officer sues a member of the public because they slipped on private property - that is simply not the sort of attitude police officers should exhibit.

'I want to work with the Federation to make sure police officers don’t make frivolous claims.'
