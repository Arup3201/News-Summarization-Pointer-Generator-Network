A football programme emblazoned with a swastika from a match between Nazi Germany and the Irish Free State is going under the hammer.

The 77-year-old programme is expected to fetch up to €500 when it goes on sale in Dublin next year.

Some 28,000 football fans packed Dalymount Park to watch Ireland win the match on October 17, 1936.

Unusual: The Ireland v Germany programme - which is expected to fetch up to ¿500 - is among the hundreds of unusual lots at a history, literature and collectibles sale hosted by Whytes in Dublin in March

Footage from the event shows the German side giving Nazi salutes as they listen to their national anthem.

According to local reports at the time, the German team toured the city the day before the match, and were warmly welcomed by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alfred Byrne.

The Lord Mayor described the historic meeting as one which 'brought widely separated countries together,' and 'one of the greatest factors in ensuring peace among nations,' according to the Irish Times.

The hotly anticipated match was a tense spectacle, with the teams level at half time.

The Irish side scored three goals in the second half, to the delight of local press whose headlines the following day celebrated: 'Stern display brings victory'.

It was the second time that year the German national time, made up predominantly of amateur footballers, were left red-faced.

The 1936 Berlin Olympics saw the squad knocked out during the semi-finals after a 2-0 loss to Norway.

Italy went on to win the gold, while Great Britain were knocked out by Poland. Bertie Fulton became the first Northern Ireland footballer to play at the Olympics that year.

Ian Whyte of Whytes auctioneers said the lot, of which the programme is part, would be of 
interest to sports fans who collect programmes, as well as those with an
 interest in European history.

‘It's quite chilling to see,’ he said of the swastika. ‘In the past a similar programme fetched up to £800.’

Key tags from the H Blocks in the Maze
 prison and Celtic wood carvings made by republican inmates held at 
Portlaoise and Long Kesh are also in the historic sale.

The set of ten key tags were found 
by contractors called in to demolish the notorious Maze, which closed in
 2000.

‘This is the second time we've offered 
these,’ he said. ‘We sold them in 2010 to a man, but he has since died 
and his son is selling them on,' added Mr Whyte.

They are expected to fetch €300 to €500
 (£250 to £420).

Historic military uniforms, decommissioned weapons, documents and a pair of duelling pistols will also be auctioned.

Another highlight is a framed 1960 US election poster for John F Kennedy, which is expected to fetch between €400 and €600 (£330 to £500).
