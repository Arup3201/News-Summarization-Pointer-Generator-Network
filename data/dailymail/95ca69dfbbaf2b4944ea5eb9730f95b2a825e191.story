Junior Seau, one of the NFL's best and fiercest players for nearly two decades, had a degenerative brain disease when he committed suicide last May, it has been revealed.

Results of an NIH study of Seau's brain revealed abnormalities consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

The NIH, based in Bethesda, Maryland, conducted a study of three unidentified brains, one of which was Seau's.

It said the findings on Seau were similar to autopsies of people 'with exposure to repetitive head injuries,' the Associated Press reported.

Seau's family requested the analysis of his brain, which was overseen by Dr Russell Lonser.

Seau was a star linebacker for 20 NFL seasons with San Diego, Miami and New England before retiring in 2009. He died of a self-inflicted shotgun wound.

He joins a list of several dozen football players who had CTE.

Boston University's center for study of the disease reported last month that 34 former pro players and nine who played only college football suffered from CTE.

'I was not surprised after learning a little about CTE that he had it,' Seau's 23-year-old son Tyler said. 'He did play so many years at that level. I was more just kind of angry I didn't do something more and have the awareness to help him more, and now it is too late.

'I don't think any of us were aware 
of the side effects that could be going on with head trauma until he 
passed away. We didn't know his behavior was from head trauma.'

That
behavior, according to Tyler Seau and Junior's ex-wife Gina, included 
wild mood swings, irrationality, forgetfulness, insomnia and depression.

'He
emotionally detached himself and would kind of 'go away' for a little 
bit,' Tyler Seau said. 'And then the depression and things like that. It
started to progressively get worse.'

He hid it well in public, they said. But not when he was with family or close friends.

Months after Seau's retirement, he was arrested on suspicion of abusing his 
live-in girlfriend at their home in Oceanside in San Diego County.

Hours after being released from custody, the 41-year-old drove his car over a beach-side cliff in Carlsbad, California.

Honoured: Seau was awarded a volunteer service award by President George W. Bush in 2005

Officials said Seau's injuries from the car crash were not life-threatening.

There was no evidence of drugs or alcohol involved in the crash and Seau told authorities he fell asleep while driving.

He started the Junior Seau Foundation
in 1992, which is dedicated to raising money for education and 
awareness campaigns for young people.

Seau
is the eighth death among members of the 1994 AFC champion Chargers, 
which lost the Super Bowl that year to the San Francisco 49ers.

Triumph: Seau came out of retirement to play 
with the Patriots in search of a Super Bowl ring and was with the team 
when they lost to the New York Giants in 2008

He amassed 1,524 tackles, 56 1/2 sacks and 18 interceptions in his career.

The NFL faces lawsuits by thousands 
of former players who say the league withheld information on the harmful
effects concussions can have on their health.

Seau is not the first former NFL player to have had CTE before killing himself. Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling are others.

Duerson, a former Chicago Bears defensive back, left a note asking for his brain to be studied for signs of trauma before shooting himself.

His family filed a wrongful death suit against the NFL, claiming the league didn't do enough to prevent or treat the concussions that severely damaged his brain.

Easterling played safety for the Falcons in the 1970s. After his career, he suffered from dementia, depression and insomnia, according to his wife, Mary Ann. He committed suicide last April.

Height: 6' 3"

Weight: 248 pounds

Games played: 268

Drafted: 1990 (First round, fifth overall)

Sacks: 56.5

Interceptions: 18

Total yards: 238

Tackles: 1,524

Pro bowl appearances: 12

Mary Ann Easterling is among the plaintiffs who have sued the NFL.

'It was important to us to get to the
bottom of this, the truth,' Gina Seau said, 'and now that it has been 
conclusively determined from every expert that he had obviously had it, 
CTE, we just hope it is taken more seriously.

'You can't deny it exists, and it is 
hard to deny there is a link between head trauma and CTE. There's such 
strong evidence correlating head trauma and collisions and CTE.'

Tyler Seau played football through high school and for two years in college. He says he has no symptoms of any brain trauma.

Gina Seau's son, Jake, now a high 
school junior, played football for two seasons, but has switched to 
lacrosse and has been recruited to play at Duke.

'Lacrosse is really his sport and 
what he is passionate about,' she said. 'He is a good football player 
and probably could continue. But especially now watching what his dad 
went through, he says, 'Why would I risk lacrosse for football?'

'I didn't have to have a discussion with him after we saw what Junior went through.'

Her 12-year-old son, Hunter, has shown no interest in playing football.

'That's fine with me,' she said.
