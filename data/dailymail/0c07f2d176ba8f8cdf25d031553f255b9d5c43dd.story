If you’re terrible with numbers but never forget a face, your life could be about to get quite a bit easier.

Because scientists are planning to replace fiddly passwords and PINs with an access code based on pictures.

The Facelock system capitalises on the human brain’s excellent ability to recognise faces, which its creators say makes it almost impossible to forget.

The Facelock system asks users to identify familiar faces, including friends and celebrities, across a range of photos, known as a Challenge Grid (pictured). By showing faces only the user recognises, the research team claim it's harder for hackers to gain access to web accounts

Facelock asks people to identify familiar faces across a range of different photos.

Previous research has found people recognise a face even if images are poor.

The system uses a set of faces known to a user, to create a personalised ‘lock’.

Users
 can pick portraits of people familiar to them, which can include idols 
such as sports personalities, musicians or even poker players.

Researchers then create a set of faces known to that user only, to make it difficult for hackers to break into accounts.

If we know someone well we will quickly recognise them in a photo even if it is blurred or hazy.

But when we are shown two pictures of a stranger, we often assume the images show two different people.

Scientists from Glasgow and York  universities asked volunteers to name Z-list celebrities who they knew well, but most people would not.

The team then made up panels of nine pictures, each showing one celebrity face and eight strangers.

Volunteers were shown four of the panels and asked to spot the faces they knew. They got all four right almost 100 per cent of the time. 

Even a year later, they still did extremely well, journal PeerJ reports.

The researchers said this is because, unlike with passwords, they did not have to memorise anything.

Do you remember: Faces may soon replace passwords but will you remember who's who?

This scatterplot shows the relationship between personal attackers' acquaintance ratings, and the number of correctly guessed targets in their first attacks. The area of each datapoint is sized to correspond to the number of cases contributing to it

Previous research found matching identical images (a) is trivial, matching different images of unfamiliar faces is hard (b), but matching different images of familiar faces is easy (c)

Tests also showed it was very hard for
 strangers to crack the code.

Spouses sometimes spotted all four faces, 
but the risk could be cut by using more obscure celebrities or more 
pictures.

Lead author 
Dr Rob Jenkins said: ‘Pretending to know a face you don’t know is like 
pretending to know a language you don’t know – it just doesn’t work.

‘The only system that can reliably recognise faces is a human who is familiar with the faces concerned.’

It is hoped software firms will use the research to create photo access codes for computers and mobile phones.

The
 ‘lock’ consists of a series of face grids, and each grid is constructed 
so that one face is familiar to the user, whilst all other faces are 
unfamiliar.

Authentication is a matter of simply touching the familiar face in each grid.

But for fraudsters, looking at the same grid will be left confused as none of the faces stand out.

Researchers said the system is better than current methods as users don’t have to consign complex passwords or PINs to memory, or put names to faces.

Past psychological research has shown that familiarity with a face is virtually impossible to lose, and in the current study users authenticated easily even after a one-year gap.

In contrast, disused passwords can be forgotten within days.

Plus, Facelock is said to be hard to crack.

Researchers asked volunteer attackers to watch a successful authentication sequence based on four target faces, so they could pick out the same four faces from similar test grids.

However, the attacks were thwarted simply by using different photos of the same faces in the test grids.

For the user, who is familiar with the target faces, it is easy to recognise the faces across a range of images.

For the attacker, who is unfamiliar with the target faces, generalising across images is difficult.
