Fans of former England footballer Paul Gascoigne, popularly known as 'Gazza', were left confused and fearing for his future as a Free Gaza campaign took off online.

Tweets with the hashtag #freegaza have been trending on Twitter in response to the violence in the Middle East, with users using their posts to urge Israeli forces to stop their assault on the Gaza Strip. The conflict, which started on July 8, has led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people.

But followers of the troubled player, 
who has become known for his battles with alcohol and drugs, mistakenly 
thought that he had been arrested and that the campaign was in support 
of his freedom.

Others turned to the social network for answers. One user wrote: 'What has Paul Gascoigne done now has he been arrested #freegaza'.

Some users admitted their confusion at the similar names, with one writing: 'Always think these tweets about #Gaza are about paul gascoigne [sic]'.

Other tweets revealed his baffled fans thought that he was closely linked to the disputed region.

One user wrote: 'I thought the Gaza strip was a row of bars and clubs in Newcastle in honour of Paul Gascoigne... I need to watch the news more often!'

The trend on Twitter comes as Spain's leading film stars Penélope Cruz, Pedro Almodóvar and Javier Bardem became the latest major celebrities to go public with their views on the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

The trio are among a group of actors who have penned an open letter in a Spanish newspaper calling for Europe to condemn Israel's bombing of the Palestinian territory, which has now claimed at least 1,200 lives - many of them civilians.

The Spanish stars follow in the wake of celebrities, including singers Zayn Malik, Rihanna and Selena Gomez, and comedian Joan Rivers, who have spoken out either for or against the bombardment.

Gomez posted a message of Instagram 
saying: 'It's About Humanity. Pray for Gaza', before going on to tweet 
that she was 'not picking sides', adding that she was 'praying for peace
 and humanity for all.'

Back on Twitter, Omri Casspi, the first NBA player born in Israel, put his feelings in capital letters.

Palestinians was Malaysian cyclist Azizulhasni Awang who wore gloves 
emblazoned with the words 'Free Gaza' while taking part in the 
Commonwealth Games.
