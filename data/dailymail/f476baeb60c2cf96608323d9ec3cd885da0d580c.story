They are known some of the most deadly animals in the sea - responsible for a large percentage of fatal human attacks.

But these divers are unfazed as they feed tiger sharks by hand off the coast of the Bahamas.

Belgian underwater photographer Ellen Cuylaerts, 44, captured the photographs in a shallow sand bank off the coast of Tiger Beach.

The terrifying underwater photos capture a tiger shark being fed by expert Debra Canabal off the coast of the Bahamas

Ms Canabal claims the experience of diving with sharks is not dangerous if divers are well-informed about the situation

The shark diver in the photos is Debra Canabal, a specialist who runs diving workshops, allowing holidaymakers to get up-close with the 'misunderstood' animals.

Ellen, now living in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, explains: 'In these photographs you see a tiger shark coming to feed at the bait crate for the first time.

'The bait crate is used to establish a connection between divers and sharks.

'In this case it was used to gain trust in order to remove hooks from their mouths, which had been put there by hunters.

Ms Cuylaerts says the situation isn't dangerous if you accept you are entering the shark's realm when you head underwater

'The shark handler was Debra Canabal. She's a delicate 5ft tall, fragile looking mother-of-one, and she runs a shark diving operation with her husband Vincent Canabal.

'When I saw Debra handling the shark and gaining its trust, I, as a woman, felt proud.

'The shark diving world is still dominated by men, where lots of adrenaline and action can be found, but it does not have to be like this.

'More and more women are proving that peaceful encounters can be just as fulfilling.' 

Spending a total of eight hours with the sharks, Ellen was able to photograph the creatures 23ft deep underwater and watch as the instructors fed them.

The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter, and is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks, consuming a variety of prey ranging from fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, dolphins and even other smaller sharks.

Although shark attacks are a relatively rare phenomenon, the tiger shark is responsible for a large percentage of fatal attacks and is regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species.

Ms Cuylaerts says: 'It's not dangerous if you are well informed and know what to do.

The tiger shark seems unfazed by the scuba divers who gathered to capture images and footage of the dangerous animals

'In my opinion descending and ascending is the trickiest part of those shark dives, not because of the sharks but because of the current and your position and place in the water.

'If you enter the water with sharks you have to be aware that you enter their realm and you have to adapt.

'Having an eye on all sharks at any time and knowing how to react when they come too close for comfort is the key!

'While a lot of people don't like the idea of feeding marine life, we have to admit that this allows us to come in close contact with sharks and capture images of them that can educate people that sharks are no man-eaters or mindless killers, and that we need to protect them.'
