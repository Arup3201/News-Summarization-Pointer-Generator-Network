Louis van Gaal frustration over losing the majority of his squad to international duty for the next 10 days has been compounded by the fact that Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo must travel to the Far East with Argentina for two exhibition games.

Van Gaal desperately wants to work with his players after admitting that United’s second-half performance was below standard in Sunday’s 2-1 win over Everton at Old Trafford.

A number of them – including Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans, Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick and Ashley Young – are still recovering from injury, while many more will not report back to Carrington until the middle of next week.

Van Gaal appreciates the need for players to balance their commitments to club and country from his time as Holland coach, and is also fortunate that United do not play their next match at West Brom until Monday, October 20.

But it clearly rankles that Di Maria and Rojo have to travel so far to play in Argentina’s friendlies against Brazil in Beijing on Saturday and then face hosts Hong Kong three days later.

Discussing United’s poor second-half display against Everton, Van Gaal said: ‘That is why we have to train, but now all my players are gone. The rest are injured so we cannot train. Now I have to wait.

‘Di Maria and Rojo are coming back from Hong Kong. They are playing two friendly games. They are coming back with jetlag so I cannot train at once and then I have to wait.

‘Then I have only two or three days before the game with West Bromwich Albion. That is my problem I know and we live in this football world. I was also a national coach but it is not so easy as everybody thinks.’
