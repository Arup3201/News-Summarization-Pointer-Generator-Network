Tragic: Ying Wu, pictured, and Ming Qu were gunned down in their silver BMW

A gunman opened fire on a BMW near the University of Southern California campus early Wednesday, killing two graduate students from China in what may have been a carjacking attempt, police said.

The couple was sitting in the new 3-series luxury car when the gunman fired around 1am, shattering the car windows. The woman, Ying Wu, was found slumped in the front passenger seat.

The wounded man, Ming Qu, managed to get out of the car and run to a nearby home, where he pounded on the door pleading for help and someone called 911, according to police, but soon collapsed.

It wasn't known if anyone answered the door before the man collapsed.

Paramedics took the victims to downtown's California Hospital Medical Centre where they were dead on arrival, authorities said.

'This is every parent's nightmare,â€™police Cmdr. Andrew Smith told the Associated Press.

The man, Ming Qu, and the woman, Ying Wu, were both graduate students from China studying electrical engineering, the university said in a statement. Both were in their 20s, police said.

Their hometowns and exact ages were not immediately clear.

Investigators say it may have been a robbery or a carjacking attempt. Witnesses said the car was in the roadway, not at the curb, at the time of the shooting.

The gunman fled and no one has been arrested, Cmdr. Smith said. Police have taken the $60,000 BMW away for examination and were attempting to determine if there were any surveillance cameras in the area.

Blown out: The windows of the BMW luxury car were blown away; Ying Wu was found slumped over in her seat, and Qu tried to get out for help

Attempted: Police believe they were murdered either in an attempted robbery or car-jacking

Four people have been killed this year in the area, police said, but violent crime is down 20 per cent this year.

Gloria Tigolo lives on the street where the shooting occurred and said she heard a single gunshot. She went downstairs but didn't go outside because it was raining. 'It was just one big shot,' she said. 'I am amazed that one gunshot could kill two people.'

Investigators said earlier that several shots were fired at the couple.

Ms Tigolo said the area is peaceful 
and this is the first shooting she can recall since she moved to the 
neighbourhood three years ago.

Prestigious: As many as 35 per cent of USC's international student population is comprised of the Chinese

Rough around the edges: The neighbourhood, though gentrifying, is in a seedy area of Los Angeles

At USC, nearly 35 per cent, or 2,513,
of the school's 7,226 international students are Chinese, according to 
the university's 2011 figures. The school, with 38,000 students total, 
has the largest number of international students of any U.S. university.

In addition to those from China, 17.5
per cent of the international students are from India, 10 per cent from
South Korea, 5.5 per cent from Taiwan, 4.4 per cent from Canada, 2.3 
per cent from Iran and just above two per cent each from Hong Kong and 
Indonesia.

The types of students who come from 
abroad to attend U.S. universities and colleges typically skew wealthier
because they have to be able to afford a school's tuition without 
financial aid.

With China's economic boom, more families can now afford 
to send their children overseas.out it they would be worried,' said Ms Cho, who is studying business.

Chinese
college students have helped fuel record international student 
enrolment on U.S. campuses in recent years.

Students from China 
represent nearly one-fourth of the nearly 724,000 international students
attending colleges and universities in this country.

Amy
Cho and Ingyo Hwang, both international students from Korea, said they 
were saddened to hear about the deaths.

Both women said they hadn't 
heard from their parents because of the time difference, but they do 
expect to hear from them.

Ms Hwang, who is studying piano, said she's often at the campus late at night and she like other international students are scared because the school is located in a gritty part of Los Angeles.

'A lot of people are going to be talking about the shooting because they were international students,' said Hwang, who moved from Baltimore to be in a safer area.

Students Kenny Liu, who is Chinese-American and lives nine blocks from where the shooting occurred, said the area is unsafe and that it's also not uncommon to see BMWs and other expensive cars parked near the campus.

'If I owned a BMW, I wouldn't drive it here,' he said.

USC is in an urban centre not far from gang-infested neighbourhoods. But gentrification has begun in the West Adams district.

Beatriz Moreno, who lives across the street with her family from where the shooting occurred, said the neighbourhood has been cleaned up. The last shooting she could recall was in 2003.

'We used to see this every day,' Moreno said. 'There are mostly families here. This is not normal.'
