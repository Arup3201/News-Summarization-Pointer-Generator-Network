Samir Nasri has warned that the future of Manchester City’s stars and their manager Manuel Pellegrini are at stake in Tuesday’s crucial Champions League clash with Bayern Munich.

City will almost certainly go out of the competition if they lose to the Group E winners at the Etihad after picking up just two points from their first four games.

And Nasri fears the Premier League champions will stage a ruthless clearout next summer if the current squad cannot justify Sheik Mansour’s huge investment by joining Europe’s elite in the knockout stage.

‘Let’s be honest, we need to do something or otherwise next year it’s going to be new players, it’s going to be everything,’ said the Frenchman.

‘That’s how it works when you play for a big club. With the salary of every player and the level of those players, 90 per cent of the team is world class.

‘Then not to qualify from the first round of the Champions League would be a huge blow for the club — and for us as well. With the players we have and everything, the owner gives us his trust, we have to return it in the Champions League. It’s the perfect scene to show we can compete with the best team in the world.

‘We have a chance to play for a big club and we are treated the right way. Sometimes it’s not good to talk too much, it’s better to talk with your feet. We have leaders in the squad and the manager talks a lot as well. So stop talking.

‘In the last three years I have been here we have won the Premier League twice and been runners-up, but now we have to improve in the Champions League if we want to be a top club. It’s not enough to be top in your league if you don’t do anything in the Champions League.

‘We need to show that we are smart players and to use what happened in the last couple of years to improve. We still have a chance and we need to take it. Now is the moment.’

Pellegrini was hired to take City forward in Europe and guided the club to the knockout stage for the first time last season, but they are bottom of Group E and face an uphill battle to beat CSKA Moscow and Roma to second place.

Only two teams in Champions League history — FC Porto and Lokomotiv Moscow — have qualified after taking two points or less from the opening four games, and Nasri believes City are lucky to still have a chance of going through.

‘For the moment we haven’t performed in the Champions League and that is a reality,’ he added. ‘We need to take it (their chance) now because we are not going to have any favours from anyone else anymore.’
