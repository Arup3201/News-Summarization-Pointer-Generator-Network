Osama Bin Laden fathered four children while on the run in Pakistan in the nine years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to his youngest wife while skipping from safe house to safe house among family.

'I can only begin to imagine that that 
looked like American reality TV,' Phil Mudd who helped lead the CIA's 
hunt for Bin Laden told ABC. 'That he was living in some version of the 
Kardashians in Abbottabad.'

During that time, the former Al Qaeda 
leader moved between five safe houses and at least two of the four children 
were born in a government hospital, his former-wife Amal Ahmad Abdul Fateh said.

Speaking to Pakistani investigators, the 30-year-old woman has painted the picture after providing the most detailed account of her husband's life as the world's most wanted man.

It is likely to heap further embarrassment on Pakistan, after U.S. Navy SEALs killed Bin Laden in a secret raid on his compound in Abbottabad last May.

'The United States was doing what came easy to it: looking in rural areas while he was in nice homes in big cities,' Richard Clarke, a former White House counter-terrorism adviser told ABC News.

2000 - Osama Bin Laden marries his fifth wife, Amal. She joins the Al Qaeda leader and his extended family at his farm base near Kandahar in Afghanistan.

2001 - Amal gives birth to Safia, the couple's first child, in Kandahar. The attacks on the U.S. on September 11 cause the Bin Laden family to 'scatter'. Amal  is forced to stay in various homes in Karachi, Pakistan, for the nine months after 9/11.

2002 - Amal leaves Karachi for the city of Peshawar, where she reunites with her husband. From there, the Bin Laden family flees into the rural mountain areas of north-west Pakistan.

2003 - The family moves to a rented house in the small town of Haripur, where they stay for two years. Amal gives birth to a girl, Aasia, in  a government hospital.

2004 - Ibrahim, the couple's third child, is born in the same government hospital.

2005 - The Bin Ladens move to a compound in the garrison town of Abbottabad. They will live there for the remainder of the terrorist leader's life. On October 8, an earthquake strikes 
north-west Pakistan, killing 73,000 people. American aid is transported
 to the region in Chinook helicopters that fly directly 
over the terror leader's Abbottabad hideout on their way to the 
disaster zone.

2006 - Amal givers birth to another girl, Zainab.

2008 - The couple welcomes a second son, Hussain.

2011 - U.S. Navy SEALs raid the Abbottabad compound on May 2, killing Bin Laden. Amal and two other wives are taken into custody.

Amal's account of Bin Laden's post-9/11 life begins in late 2001, when the terrorist mastermind fled Afghanistan and into Pakistan, up until his death aged 54.

Amal was arrested by Pakistani security officials following the U.S. raid alongside two of Bin Laden's other wives and her five children.

It is thought that she was shot by a Navy SEAL while trying to protect her husband.

The three widows hold potentially vital information for Western security forces - as well as shining light on how Bin Laden managed to evade justice for so long.

They are currently under house arrest in Islamabad.

A transcript of an interrogation of Amal by Pakistani officials in January was published in Pakistani newspaper Dawn yesterday.

It reveals that Amal wed Bin Laden in 2000 out of her 'desire of marrying a mujahid', or 'Holy warrior'.

In late 2000, she joined the terrorist
 and his wives at his farm base near Kandahar in Afghanistan before the 
attacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001 caused the Bin Laden family to
 'scatter'.

Safia, Amal's first child with the Al Qaeda leader, was born in Kandahar that year.

In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, she stayed in various homes in Karachi, Pakistan, for around nine months.

In mid-2002, she left Karachi for the large city of Peshawar, where she was reunited with her husband.

From
 there, the Bin Laden family fled into the rural mountain areas of 
north-west Pakistan, first staying in the Shangla district in Swat, just
 80 miles away from Islamabad.

In 2003, they moved to a rented house in small town of Haripur, even closer to the capital, where they stayed for two years.

During their time there, Amal gave 
birth to a girl, Aasia, in 2003 and a boy, Ibrahim, in 2004. Both were 
born in a government hospital.

It was from there, in 2005, that Bin Laden made the move to Abbottabad where he lived until his death in May 2011.

Home: Bin Laden's three wives and two daughters lived with him in the Abbottabad hideout just 200 yards from a military base which was raided last year

Zainab, a girl, and Hussain, a boy, were born in the garrison town in 2006 and 2008.

Frustratingly for the West, it appears that the U.S. came tantalisingly close to capturing Bin Laden.

In late 2005, an earthquake struck north-west Pakistan, killing 73,000 people. American aid was transported to the region in Chinook helicopters that Amal claims flew directly over the terror leader's Abbottabad compound on their way to the disaster zone.

The report also recommends that Bin Laden's three widows be deported to Saudia Arabia and Yemen, but the Pakistani government has instead decided to prosecute the women and two of the terrorist's adult children.the country’s elite military academy.
