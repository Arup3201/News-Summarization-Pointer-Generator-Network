Olympic skier Bode Miller and the mother of his son, Sam, reached a last minute custody agreement in Manhattan on Monday that includes online Skype chats between the gold medal winner and his 14-month-old child.

Miller, 36, flew overnight from California to attend the latest round in the acrimonious custody battle with former Marine Sara McKenna, 28, and the truce came just in time to prevent him giving potentially embarrassing testimony to the court.

Lawyers for the squabbling parents thrashed-out a temporary agreement which sees custody of Sam shared between Miller in California and McKenna in New York over the next four months.

The custody battle between Miller and his ex girlfriend Sara McKenna over their son - who is called Nate by his father and Sam by his mother - has raged for almost a year.

McKenna told reporters outside the court that she reluctantly agreed to the truce until August- rather than pushing for full custody at the advice of her lawyers.

Attorney's for the pair worked out a seven-page agreement to enable shared custody until the end of summer, that leaves McKenna the primary caregiver.

The two warring parties will meet back in court in Manhattan in September, where a psychologist will evaluate the child's well-being and how the arrangement is working.

However, McKenna was critically of the plan, especially the element which guarantees Skype chats for six-time Olympic medal winner Miller.

'He’s interested for 45 seconds, then he’s off,' McKenna said of their young son to the New York Post.

'It’s an inadequate substitute for being there — you can’t hug him or touch him.'

Despite the ceasing of hostilities for now, the custody battle has been one of the fiercest bi-coastal battles in recent memory.

The two first met through the high-end matchmaking service Kelleher and were a couple for three months.

However, they split shortly after McKenna became pregnant because Miller met professional volleyball player Morgan Beck, whom he married.

At the commencement of the custody battle last spring, Miller had not even met his three-month-old son and tried to take full custody from McKenna, claiming that because he lived in California, it was illogical for his son to live in the East Coast.

McKenna, who was also a former firefighter, moved to New York City so she could study at Columbia University last year.

Family Court Justic Fiordaliza Rodriguez approved the custody deal, saying, 'It does appear to be in the child's best interest inasmuch as it provides for substantial time with each parent.'

Earlier this month, McKenna outlined her emotional turmoil as she claimed her son had trouble recognizing her because the Olympian had kept him away from her for so long.

Miller and his wife Morgan Beck had custody of 'Nate' for five weeks in March and had originally agreed to allow McKenna to have custody of the boy for the whole month of April.

They took him to Sochi for the Winter Olympics meaning that the boy was there when he won a bronze medal.

 The month before, McKenna wrote in Cosmopolitan magazine how difficult the entire custody battle has become and her side of the dispute.

Three months into their relationship, McKenna learned she was pregnant but when she told Miller he was less than enthused.

'I told him I wanted to keep the baby. I said he could be involved if he wanted to and that I would love it if he did. If he didn't want any part of it, I said that I was going to do it on my own,' McKenna wrote in an essay for Cosmopolitan.

'I left in tears.'

Knowing that she couldn't continue to balance working as a firefighter and being a single mother, McKenna decided to move to New York to attend prestigious Columbia University on the G.I. Bill.

In addition to Columbia being a highly-competitive school, McKenna chose the New York City school because there were breast-feeding rooms on campus and family networks that would help her to raise Sam.

A month before she moved, McKenna texted Miller to let him know her plans but she says he never responded.

She was seven-months-pregnant when she arrived in New York and took up her studies one month later.

Son Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna was born on February 23, 2013 and she filed for temporary custody of the child three days later.

But when Sam was just two weeks old, McKenna learned that her ex-boyfriend and filed for custody of the child despite never expressing any interest in being the boy's father. Miller and wife Morgan had also experienced a miscarriage that January.

Miller sent the custody papers to her home in San Diego, despite knowing she didn't live there, and that set off a complex multi-state custody battle.

Eventually the case was sent back to California and on September 4, a judge gave Miller full-custody of Sam calling McKenna's move to New York 'irresponsible' and 'irreprehensible'.

After losing Sam, McKenna's life turned into a 'nightmare' and she quit school and her job.

But she soon realized that being 'catatonic wasn't helping matters'. And she re-enrolled and continued her studies while relentlessly pursuing a way to get Sam back for good.

 All the while McKenna tracked her son's life with Miller on her ex and his new wife's social media profiles and noticed they were calling him 'Nathaniel'.

'I would look for photos of Sam on Instagram and Twitter and saw that Bode was calling him Nathaniel. That was really heartbreaking. Our son’s name is Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna. Calling him anything else is just confusing.

'There were also tons of photos of Bode’s wife holding Sam like he was her baby. That was very hard to bear,' McKenna added.

The next time McKenna saw her son was at a court hearing on November 25 where she won back custody of Sam.

'I was sitting in court when I heard Sam’s sweet little voice down the hall. As soon as I saw him, I reached out and said, 'I missed you!'

He put his arms out for me and said, “Mama!” We still had to deal with a court hearing that day, but I didn’t care. I could breathe again. I was whole. The next day was my birthday. I woke up next to Sam, and he started giggling — that was the best present I’ve ever received in my life,' she said.

McKenna is back living in New York and hopes to work out stable life for Sam where he can see both of his parents.

'That's all I want for our son,' she wrote.

The experience of losing her son has also inspired her studies as she is now pursuing a law degree to help others in her position.
