Benjamin Knight, of Eaton Rapids, Michigan, is facing charges of distributing disturbing child porn

A 28-year-old man is facing charges after he was found with child porn that police have said was the most 'gruesome' they'd ever seen.

Benjamin Knight, of Eaton Rapids, Michigan, was arrested earlier this month for alleged child porn distribution of images depicting babies and bestiality.  

He is due to appear in court next week after police found images of children under the age of five engaged in sexual acts on his phone and home computers. 

A Battle Creek Police Department spokesman told Daily Mail Online on Thursday that the case was one of the most 'gruesome' he had ever seen.

Major Jim Grafton also told freep.com: 'There are some disturbing images of some very young children doing bad things.'

The police chief said that at time the investigation had become too much for his officers and they had to shut off the sordid tapes and 'walk away'. 

Police obtained a search warrant for Knight's home after he showed a disturbing video to a fellow customer at an adult store, Romantix, in Battle Creek. 

He was arraigned on January 12 on eight counts relating to distributing child porn and was held on $250,000 bond. 

Investigators do not believe that the abusive material was made locally and it does not appear that Knight is in the images.  

The 28-year-old, who does not appear to be married according to public records, faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty. 

He does not appear to have a criminal record.  

The investigation is ongoing and police are coming through Knight's electronic devices.
