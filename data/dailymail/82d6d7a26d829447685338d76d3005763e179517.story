Alastair Cook stood in disbelief after
 rocking back to play his favoured pull but only succeeded in bottom 
edging Dhammika Prasad and seeing the ball cannon into his stumps. It 
was the lowest point of the worst day of his captaincy.

When
 Cook was churning out hundred after hundred he would simply have 
despatched the ball to the boundary but now, woefully out of form and 
fighting for his captaincy life, even the shot that has earned him a 
huge chunk of his 8,000 plus Test runs had badly let him down.

Cook was gone for 16, Gary Ballance followed next ball and England began crashing in the most demoralised, shambolic manner possible to the unheralded talents of a 31-year-old journeyman in Prasad, who took four prime wickets.

When nightwatchman Liam Plunkett tamely lobbed Rangana Herath to cover off what became the last ball of the day England’s misery was almost complete. At 57 for five chasing a massive 350 to win this second Test and the Investec series they face a humiliating and hugely damaging defeat.

There were many dark days during a winter when England were taken apart by Australia but this is surely as bad as it can get for a captain who survived the mass cull that greeted a 5-0 Ashes whitewash.

Disappointment: Captain Alastair Cook failed again as he was bowled for 16 in the second innings

A two-Test home series against Sri Lanka 
was meant to provide a gentle start to the new era, a chance for England
 to regroup and for Cook to prove that he can mould a team in his image 
and lead England forward positively.

Instead, barring a miracle even 
beyond 1981 on this ground, it will turn into Sri Lanka’s historic
 first Test series win in England to complete a clean sweep after their 
victories in the Twenty20 international and the one-day series.

That 
will be a crushing blow for England’s new regime, not least a captain in
 Cook who will now go into a high profile series against India under 
enormous pressure. If he gets that far. It is not inconceivable, with 
England a rabble under his leadership on Monday, that Cook will now fall
 on his sword.

Setback: England's Ian Bell was quickly sent back to the pavilion

England have invested hugely in Cook and will 
unquestionably want to give him a lot more time than this but to be 
outclassed by Sri Lanka and their supposedly pop gun attack at home will
 seriously test the ECB's loyalty and belief.

Remember, England 
dominated the bulk of the first two days of this Test having come within
 one wicket of winning the first but the transformation since England 
were coasting at 311 for three in reply to Sri Lanka’s 257 has been 
total.

Sri Lanka, supposedly the warm-up for the main Indian act, 
have been sensational under their highly impressive captain in Angelo 
Mathews and have proved their quality and toughness here but there is no
 excuse for England.

They were pathetic from the moment
 Cook allowed Sri Lanka to milk another 40 runs from the remaining seven
 overs with the old ball without looking to take wickets to the bitter 
end with Plunkett’s comical demise.

There can be no sparing of a 
captain who lacked any sense of tactical acumen in the field while his 
opposite number scored his second consecutive hundred and then carried 
on his long spell without a century of his own.

England were 
still in this match when Plunkett took two wickets in consecutive balls 
for the second time in this Test to leave Sri Lanka 169 ahead with only 
three wickets left. But their hopes were soon painfully dashed.

Late blow: Sri Lanka celebrate the dismissal of nightwatchman Liam Plunkett

Cook
 had refused to attack Mathews from the moment Mahela Jayawardene fell, 
instead trying to target the tail, and allowed him to move from his 
overnight 24 to a priceless 160 for Sri Lanka, principally in a stand of
 149 with Rangana Herath.

Most baffling was Cook’s refusal to 
turn to Moeen Ali for the bulk of that stand between lunch and tea even 
though he had taken the wickets of two key left-handers on Sunday and 
was facing a third in Herath who has a history of swishing at 
off-spinners.

Instead Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, who will be 
crucial when England face those five Tests in six weeks against India, 
were flogged into the ground while Chris Jordan struggled to make an 
impact in his second Test.

Impressive: England paceman Liam Plunkett finished with math haul of nine wickets

England, who squandered seven chances 
in the Sri Lankan first innings and another crucial one at the start of 
their second, were again culpable in their own demise, 
dropping three more chances and wasting their two reviews.

Most 
crucial was Plunkett spilling Mathews on 87 off his own bowling while 
England’s lack of judgment over reviews was exposed when umpire Billy 
Bowden missed a clear edge from Shaminda Eranga off a steaming Anderson.

Bowden had almost as bad a day as Cook, later giving two palpably 
wrong caught behind decisions against England that were both overturned,
 with the suspicion that the words he exchanged with Anderson had 
affected his judgment.

Yet the umpire will not affect the outcome
 and some time on Tuesday, probably sooner rather than later, England will be
 faced with another bout of soul-searching just as difficult as anything
 they encountered last winter.

This England team are firmly 
behind Cook and the leadership alternatives to him are probably 
restricted to Ian Bell or Joe Root but the captain will have much 
thinking to do when he returns to his family farm away from Headingley’s
 unforgiving glare. It was not meant to be like this.
