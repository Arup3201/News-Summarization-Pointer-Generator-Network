The Czech Republic has long been regarded as one of the most popular destinations for British men's stag parties: At one point, it was reported that 20 per cent of all weekend crime in Prague was caused by them.

Perhaps one reason so many tourists flock to the Czech Republic is because of its relaxed attitude to sex, affairs and alcohol.

The country has been deemed the most accepting of moral issues in the world, closely followed - bizarrely - by Japan.

Cheers! Prague is one of the world's most popular destinations for stag parties, one pictured here. In a recent survey entitled Global Views of Morality, the Czech Republic was the most accepting of affairs, alcohol and sex

According to The Pew Research Center’s 2013 Global 
Attitudes Project, Europe, Japan and countries within South 
America are the most tolerant to premarital sex, with the Czech Republic coming out on top.

67 per cent of those questioned in the 
survey from the country said they were accepting, compared to 59 per 
cent in Greece, 57 per cent in Germany, 42 per cent in Italy and 38 
percent in Britain.

Britain is amongst one of the most relaxed attitudes in Europe towards sex before marriage, but one of the most disapproving of extramarital affairs.

Just four per cent of British respondents deemed them acceptable, along with Australia and Canada.

17 per cent is the figure for the Czech Republic, the highest of all the countries when asked whether affairs were acceptable.

It is followed closely by France, where the figure was 12 per cent.

Outside of Europe, Venezuela is the most relaxed in terms of premarital sex, with 61 per cent believing it is acceptable.

The Pew Research Center’s survey asked 40,117 respondents in 40 countries what they thought about eight topics often discussed as moral issues: extramarital affairs, gambling, homosexuality, abortion, premarital sex, alcohol consumption, divorce, and the use of contraceptives.

They were asked to rate each topic as morally acceptable, unacceptable, or not a moral issue.

Overall, whilst the Czech Republic is the most morally relaxed, according to the results Japan follows closely behind.

66 per cent of the country are accepting of alcohol use, 55 per cent accepting of divorce, 47 per cent of premarital sex and 44 per cent accepting of abortion, a figure even higher than in the US, where just 17 per cent think abortion is OK.

The US are also more morally opposed to homosexuality than Japan.

Just 23 per cent of those questioned think being gay is acceptable.

In Japan the figure is 38 per cent, Brazil 44 per cent, Spain 55 per cent and Czech Republic comes out on top again, with 56 per cent.

Those most unaccepting of homosexuality is Ghana, Pakistan, Egypt, Uganda and Nigeria, where the figure is just one per cent.
