Kodak may have hit hard times in recent years, but 120 years ago it was the pioneer of home photography.

In 1888 it created the Kodak No.1, which gave consumers a chance to capture relaxed scenes which had previously only been taken by professional photographers.

These snapshots taken by amateurs give a charming insight into everyday life in the 19th century.

It was simple to use - users would simply point in the direction of their subject, although it was a guessing game as there was not a viewfinder yet, reports Gizmodo.

They would then wind the film, open the shutter, and press a button to actually capture the picture.

The No. 1 came pre-loaded with enough negatives to produce 100 photos.

New beginnings: The Kodak No,1  sold for $25 which was pricey to consumers back then

The user sent the whole camera back to Kodak to develop the circular, 2.5 inch-wide images.

According to Camerapedia,
 the round image was a design decision -  it ensured that
 the user did not have to hold the camera too straight as well as to compensate for the poor image quality at the 
corners of the image.

Along with the images, Kodak would also return the camera—fully-loaded with paper for 100 more snaps. 

The camera, with box joints and a strong leather covering was marketed with the slogan 'You press the button, we do the rest.'

Eastman designed the cameras in collaboration with a cabinetmaker, Frank A. Brownell, who set up the production line at the factory.

Years later Kodak is now seen as one of the biggest corporate casualties of the digital age, having failed to quickly embrace modern technologies such as digital photography, its own invention.

It was filed for bankruptcy protection last year and announced it would stop making digital cameras, pocket video cameras and and digital picture frames in the first half of 2012, in a bid to cut costs.

But last month it was revealed that the company will now concentrate on selling printing equipment and services to businesses.

'We
 have emerged as a technology company serving imaging for business 
markets - including packaging, functional printing, graphic 
communications and professional services,' said Antonio Perez, chief 
executive of Kodak.

'We have been revitalized by our 
transformation and restructured to become a formidable competitor - 
leaner, with a strong capital structure, a healthy balance sheet, and 
the industry's best technology.'

According to Camerapedia, the round image was a design decision, partly as a way of ensuring that the photographer didn't have to hold the camera exactly level with the horizon, and partly to compensate for the poor image quality at the corners of the image
