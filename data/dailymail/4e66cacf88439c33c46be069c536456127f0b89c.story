An auto repairman from Kansas has led officers on a high speed chase in a Japanese race car that was traveling at speeds of up to 176mph until its souped up engine blew up.

Robert Bell was arrested near Williamsburg, Kansas, last Sunday and charged with speeding, fleeing and alluding, reckless driving, impeding traffic and failure to signal.

According to sheriff's officials, the suspect, who owns an auto repair and customization shop called RB's Adrenaline Factory, was driving a red Nissan Skyline GTR, which is primarily used in motorsport.

It is illegal to drive a car like the Skyline, which has a turbo-charged engine, on US roads, unless it is at least 25 years old. It is believed that Bell's model was newer 

It is illegal to drive a car like the Skyline on US roads unless the vehicle is at least 25 years old, or if it is being driven on a closed track. 

Investigators say Bell was returning from a race in Wichita when he was caught speeding along I-35 at around 7.30am on March 22, reported the station KSNT.

Bell then allegedly led Kansas Highway Patrol troopers and sheriff’s deputies on a chase that took them through three counties.

After a 20-minute high-speed pursuit, Bell finally came to a stop at mile marker 176 when his Nissan's massive 2.6 liter turbo-charged engine exploded, allowing officers to take him into custody.

Robert Bell was hauled off to a county jail but later released on $100,000 bail.

According to RB's Adrenaline Factory’s Facebook page, Bell's business specializes in automotive repair, customizing, car parts and accessories.
