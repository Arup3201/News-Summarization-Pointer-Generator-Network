Waving wads of cash, these career criminals appear to be having a the time of their lives in jail.

At least, that's what it looks like on Facebook.

Two inmates, Timothy Forte and Earl Caldwell, were eventually charged over the snaps, which appeared to be selfies posted online from their prison.

A third was not charged. In the snaps, the group are seen posing with cash in their jailhouse jumpsuits in what is believed to have been a bizarre prank.

But jail administrators in Christian County, in the south west of the state, still don't know how it got by them.

The pair allegedly charged other inmates so they could make 'off the record' phone calls with the same cell phone from jail.

Christian County Jailer Brad Boyd said: 'They've had years of practice; they're very good at what they do. It's a constant con.

'It's a constant game to see how they can one-up authorities or one-up the system.'

The pair also allegedly charged other inmates so they could make 'off the record' phone calls with the same cell phone from jail

Jail administrators confiscated the phone. Forte and Caldwell were charged with promoting contraband.

Caldwell plead guilty and Forte fought the charges and won, Fox17.com reported.

The convicted felons are currently sitting in federal prison serving sentences on drug charges.
