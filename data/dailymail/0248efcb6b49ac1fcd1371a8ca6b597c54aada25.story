Former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf has posted hilarious pictures of himself on Twitter and Facebook  including shots of him working out at the gym as he prepares to run in the country's May elections.

The former general, who arrived home in Pakistan earlier this week after four years exile, is seen lifting weights and doing aerobics with the caption 'Starting my day with a workout. Feel very energized'.

In another shot, one of Musharraf's security men is pictured standing guard outside a building alongside a caption reading: 'Taliban threat? NOT ON MY WATCH!!!'

The 69-year-old is hated by militants
for backing America after the attacks of 11 September, 2001 and his 
return to Pakistan was immediately met with death threats from the Taliban.

He ruled Pakistan from 2001 to 2008 after seizing power in 1999 coup and is now intending to lead his party, the
All Pakistan Muslim League, in the May elections.

One picture sees him standing in 
front of a display case of swords at his house in Karachi, with the 
words; 'no place like home'.

In another he is loading up his plate with food in a canteen with the caption: 'Enjoying Pakistani Food. The best cuisine in the world. Pakistan First! PM'.

Yesterday an angry lawyer threw a shoe at Musharraf as he headed to court in southern Pakistan on Friday to face legal charges.

Musharraf, who seized power in a military coup in 1999 but was forced to step down nearly a decade later, is disliked by many lawyers throughout Pakistan because of his decision to suspend the chief justice of the Supreme Court while he was in office.

The lawyer tossed his shoe at Musharraf as the former military strongman was walking down a hallway in the court building in the city of Karachi surrounded by a mob of security, supporters and journalists, said police official Nasir Aftab.

The shoe did not hit Musharraf, and the lawyer was not detained because no charges were filed against him, said Aftab.

Throwing a shoe at someone is an especially potent insult in Muslim countries because the sole is considered unclean.

Local TV channels showed video of the incident, but it was impossible to identify the shoe thrower because he was hidden behind part of the corridor.

Following the incident, judges granted Musharraf an extension of pre-emptive bail in three cases against him, meaning he cannot be immediately arrested.

Two of the cases involve the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the killing of Akbar Bugti, a Baluch nationalist leader who died in August 2006 after a standoff with the Pakistani military. Musharraf was granted an extension of 21 days in those two cases.

He was granted a 15-day extension in connection with a third case, in which he is accused of illegally removing a number of judges at the time, including the Supreme Court chief justice, said Shahadat Awan, the prosecutor general for surrounding Sindh province.

Musharraf was also restricted from leaving the country during the period that his bail was extended, Pakistani state TV reported.
