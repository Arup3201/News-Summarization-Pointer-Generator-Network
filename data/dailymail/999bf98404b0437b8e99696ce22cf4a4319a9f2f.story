Recors revealed on Monday show that President Obama racked up another $2.5 million in hotel and rental car costs when he visited Brussels, Belgium for this month's G7 summit – and spent just one night in Belgium's capital.

Two government contract award documents show that the money was allocated to cover 141 rental vehicles and a total of 399 lodging, meeting and conference rooms.

The expenses covered Obama's June 4-5 stay in Brussels, along with costs related to 15 days of 'advance' work work by his advance team before the president participated in a G7 conference in between one-night stays in Poland and France.

A requisition for lodging in Brussels at a hotel called 'The Hotel' shows an estimated cost of $1.51 million.

An additional $1.01 million was set aside just for 'vehicle rentals.'

It was during the G7 meeting that Obama insisted, during a joint press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron, that he would make 'absolutely no apologies' for his prisoner swap with the Taliban, trading five of their most prized leaders for a single captive U.S. soldier now accused of deserting his unit in Afghanistan.

The Brussels trip was planned with less advance notice than the White House is accustomed to having, because the G7 summit was originally a 'G8' meeting scheduled for Sochi, Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin was summarily uninvited, however, and the location was moved out of Russia, after he annexed parts of the Ukraine.

But the hurried nature of the travel reservations can't be responsible for the cost.

Records from a similar one-night stay in March show that the State Department shelled out $2.9 million for the same expenses in Brussels three months ago. That's 16 per cent more.

The difference appears to be that during the March visit, Secret Service planners  spent more than $396,000 at a second hotel.

This time, 'The Hotel' had enough room for the entire White House entourage.

The government purchase order called for 'Rental of 399 Lodging rooms, Office rooms and Conference rooms ... in support of Senior High Level USG Principal traveling with a delegation.'

Obama was last in Brussels in March, for an EU-U.S. Summit at the Council of the European Union, and to visit the Flanders
 Field Cemetery for a wreath-laying.

The rental cars during both the March and June trips were requisitioned from Modern Car, a Brussels company that specializes in luxury limousines.

'Gee, only $2.5 million?' a Republican Senate aide snarked when MailOnline told him the on-the-ground cost for Obama's latest Brussels stay.

'I suddenly feel all warm and fuzzy about the president having respect for taxpayers.'

That same congressional staffer said in March that it was hard to believe 'nearly 1,000 people' had to travel with the president for a routine diplomatic meeting.

'Are there really that many Secret Service agents and clipboard-holders?' he asked then.

A search Monday on Expedia.com found 
that rooms at 'The Hotel' in Brussels can be had for £122, or about 
$207, per night on upcoming Wednesdays, the same weekday Obama spent the
 night there.

The presidential suite presumably costs far more.

The Hotel's superior rooms for ordinary travelers feature 46-inch LED TVs, private fridges with complimentary champagne and wine, and walk-in rain showers.

Modern Car features mostly Mercedez-Benz, BMW and Audi sedans.

According to the U.S. Air Force, it now costs $228,288 per hour to fly the president's customized Boeing 747. That hourly expense is up 27 per cent since Obama took office.

The Guardian reported that Belgium's cost for providing security and planning surrounding the president's March visit was at least $10.4 million at the time.

The State Department did not respond to a request for an estimate on the Belgian people's portion of the expenses for the more recent trip.

The federal government has not yet released information about the lodging and vehicle costs for Obama's stays in France and Poland during the same week earlier in the month.
