A new and potentially more accurate test for prostate cancer is being trialled across the UK.

The new multi parametric (MP) MRI scans could give accurate and detailed images making it easier to identify whether or not a patient has prostate cancer.

The new scans could also predict the size of a tumour and how aggressive it is. 

The trial is testing whether the use of these advanced MRI scans can detect the condition, without the need for painful and invasive biopsies. 

Currently, men with suspected prostate cancer have a blood test to see if a higher level of protein - known as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) - is found.

A new and potentially more accurate test for prostate cancer is being trialled across the UK. Multi parametric (MP) MRI scans can give accurate and detailed images making it easier to diagnose cancer, without a biopsy

If the protein is found, they are referred on for a transrectal ultrasound (Trus) guided biopsy.

This procedure involves using an ultrasound probe to guide a needle through the walls of the rectum and into the prostate gland to take samples to be analysed.

It is performed under local anaesthetic.

However, a spokesman for Southampton General Hospital, one of the centres trialling the new technique, said the current test is invasive but not always accurate.

He said: 'As the ultrasound cannot always reliably identify the disease, it can miss some cancers or lead to over-diagnosis, frequently resulting in unnecessary surgery.

'However, the latest imaging technology, known as multi parametric (MP) MRI, can produce accurate and detailed scans that could make it easier to identify whether or not a patient has cancer and, if so, the specific size, position and aggressiveness of it.

To protect against prostate cancer, take a lover - or 20.

Men who sleep with multiple women are almost a third less likely to develop the disease, according to Canadian research published in October.

Researchers found men who have more than 20 notches on their bedpost slashed their risk of prostate cancer by 28 per cent.

And the study also revealed that men who have slept with more than 20 women reduced their chances of getting the most aggressive tumours by 19 per cent.

Celibacy, on the other hand, doubles the risk of the disease. 

'This could enable clinicians to either rule out the need for further testing or, if cancer is found, give a clearer understanding of which part of the prostate is affected.'

At the moment, all men with raised PSA or an abnormal feeling prostate are advised to have a biopsy.

But many will not have cancer. Most will be suffering another condition which raises PSA levels in the blood, such as enlarged prostate.

Tim Dudderidge, a consultant urological surgeon at Southampton General Hospital, said these biopsies miss some cancers, and falsely diagnose others, leading to unnecessary treatment.

He said: 'These biopsies can miss cancers in some areas of the prostate which the needle cannot reach, or pick up tiny traces of cancer that might be slow-growing and harmless.

'This leads to men having unnecessary surgery to remove the prostate gland.'

Mr Dudderidge is now working with colleagues at another nine sites across the country to recruit 700 men with suspected prostate cancer for the study by October 2015.

He said: 'If, as we think, the study shows us that (MP) MRI can accurately identify those who have cancer and those who don't, it will truly revolutionise diagnosis for men with prostate cancer.

'It will mean those with a negative scan will avoid undergoing potentially painful and invasive biopsies, while those with positive scans will benefit from their specialists having much greater detail of their cancer at the earliest possible stage.'

Prostate cancer, which mainly affects men over 50, is the most common type of cancer in men with around 37,000 new cases diagnosed in the UK every year.

Currently, prostate cancer is diagnosed with a painful and invasive biopsy which involves using an ultrasound probe to guide a needle through the walls of the rectum and into the prostate gland. Here, cancerous cells are pictured under a microscope
