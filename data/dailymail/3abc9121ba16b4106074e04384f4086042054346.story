A furious mother has demanded police investigate a teacher who she says cut two labels off her daughter's shoes.

Olivia Adams, 13, was told the green and red tags on her Kickers shoes broke an 'all-black' uniform rule at the North School in Ashford, Kent.

But she was shocked when a staff member apparently knelt down and cut off the tags - while the shoes were on her feet.

Olivia Adams, pictured, said a teacher cut off the tags to her Kickers shoes while she was still wearing them. Despite being offered £55 by the North School in Ashford, Kent, her mother has gone to police

Her mother Claire Pamment immediately complained to head teacher Lesley Ellis - who apologised and offered her £55 to buy a new pair.

But Ms Pammett took the row to police, insisting the staff member committed criminal damage and assault.

The row has since escalated when Olivia was suspended for a week for naming the teacher on Facebook.

Mother-of-three Ms Pammett, a customer services advisor, said: 'I’m fuming.

'They cut the tabs off my daughter’s shoes while they were still on her feet - I just can’t believe it.

'They can’t go around doing things like this. Who does this teacher think she is?

The North School in Ashford, Kent, introduced a strict uniform policy in September and sent home 60 pupils

Head teacher Lesley Ellis declined to comment - though the school initially said Olivia gave them permission

'This is not only criminal damage to my daughter’s shoes, but it is assault because they shouldn’t be touching her. They really are pushing the rules here.

'I spoke to the teacher who claims she was acting on the head’s authority.

'But when I spoke to the head she said it had all been a mistake and that they will reimburse me.

'The school then wanted to send Olivia home until the issue was resolved but I don’t want her missing any more lessons.'

The
school told Ms Pammett Olivia had granted permission for the tags to be cut off, she said - something her daughter denied.

The incident on November 7 came after 60 students were sent home in September for not 
adhering to the strict uniform policy.

Staff disapproved of Olivia's previous shoes then - because they had too much pink trim - and have also said she was wearing the wrong skirt.

Parents
including Olivia's mother fought back saying the all-black uniform was too 
expensive, and the school agreed to provide some funds for those in need.

MailOnline contacted the school but they declined to comment.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'We are reviewing a complaint of criminal damage on November 7.'
