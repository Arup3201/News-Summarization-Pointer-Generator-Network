While most people will turn and run in the face of an erupting volcano, photographer Daniel Fox heads straight for the heat. 

The Canadian daredevil is fascinated by hypnotising beauty of lava and spent last month capturing these spectacular images of a lava field in Kalapana, Hawaii.

Taking the images meant risking his life to get just a couple of feet away from the intense heat.

‘Sometimes I could barely stay long enough to take one photo before feeling my face burn,’ he said.

Extreme photographer, Daniel Fox, 39, is fascinated by the hypnotising beauty of lava and spent last month capturing these spectacular images while visiting a friend who lives next to a lava field in Kalapana

Fox describes the images as 'visceral, organic or intense'. He would shoot two or three times a week, leaving at 6pm to hike 90 minutes searching for active lava

The intense heat causes the fiery lava to glow spectacularly against the night sky forming hundreds of unique shapes as it flows across the Hawaiian landscape.

The liquid temperature of lava as it explodes through a volcanic vent ranges from 700 to 1,200 °C.

It is 100,000 times as thick as water and can travel huge distances before cooling and turning solid.

From stark zigzagged lines to breath-taking bulges which look like a human heart no two flows are ever the same.

The 39-year old photographer, who has lived in the US for the past 15 years, could only snap a single shot at each spot before the intense heat would begin to burn.

He would shoot two or three times a week, leaving at 6pm to hike 90 minutes searching for active lava.

‘I had to be careful for the camera as with all the electronics and the memory card, the last thing I wanted was for anything to melt,’ he said.

‘Hiking to the lava field is extremely dangerous. Just a couple of weeks ago another tourist died and earlier this year a men fell into the lava.

‘People don’t realise how dangerous it is until too late. I’ve seen some venturing out with only flip flops, shorts and no water.

Fox first visited the area for a weekend in March and fell in love with it. He came back with the intent of producing content for his next photo exhibit.

‘Although interesting I always see the same kind of lava photography – with long exposures, at dusk or dawn and showing the environment.

‘But there is so much more to it. Every time lava pushes itself out it creates new unique forms – it’s like a snowflake each is different, none are alike.’

Fox aimed to take abstract, artistic photos by using a telephoto lens rather than a wide-angle one.

To do this, he used a Canon 100-400mm and Canon 100-300mm on his Canon 7D.

As the lava cools and crystallises it begins to contract and turn into igneous rock. Sometimes lava can accumulate in volcanic craters creating what is known lava lakes

‘The lava field a factory of abstract art and that is what I wanted to capture – a more artistic perspective capturing the details, textures, shapes and forms that we usually miss,’ he said.

‘The resulting photos are sometime zen, visceral, organic, or intense.’

The images may look like a series of abstract paintings, but Fox said he left most of the photos relatively untouched, apart from some masking, rotating, cropping and Lightroom image adjustments.

‘You have to be really careful and know what to expect – you have the normal heat from the lava, the accelerated dehydration cause by the wind and temperatures, the acid fumes, the extremely sharp lava rock, the treacherous terrain and the lack of orientation at night,’ said Fox.

‘You have to look for hollow spots that will give in when walking on them, which happened to me and resulted in a deep gash on my shin. Then there are the whiteouts when it rains, turning the entire place into a massive steam room.’

But if chasing 1,200 °C lava wasn’t impressive enough, Fox is now planning a six year around-the-world sailing journey called The EPIC Expedition.

The 200,000 mile sailing expedition will see Fox visit over 250 remote islands while circumnavigating twice the globe.

He hopes to produce thousands of photographs, several hundred hours of film footage, and precious scientific data from over 16 countries, four oceans, 13 different currents, and six geographical zones.
