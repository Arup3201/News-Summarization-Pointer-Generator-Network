Unwell: Brooke Todd, 17 months, pictured in hospital in Spain after falling severely ill while on holiday

A family have been offered £130 from a holiday company as a ‘goodwill gesture’ after their toddler ended up in hospital on a trip to Spain.

James Todd and Helen Ball, of Walker, Newcastle, said they complained to staff about poor hygiene standards at the all-inclusive Grupotel Mar de Menorca, which they claim led to Brooke Todd falling severely ill.

The 17-month-old was ‘frightened and screaming’ as she was placed on three separate drips as doctors tried to treat her for diarrhoea and vomiting.

Her parents allege they had informed a Thomson Holidays rep about the standard of food at the Cala Canutells, Menorca, resort.

They claim the hotel staff used the same utensils on cooked and uncooked meat.

Mr Todd said he had complained from the very first day but nothing was done until after Brooke became ill.

He said: ‘The food was not cooked properly and I was constantly complaining to the rep.

‘The chefs were using the same utensils on raw meat and then moving the cooked meat about and serving it to customers.

‘The holiday went from bad to disastrous when Helen woke up just before midnight and found Brooke face down choking in her cot.

‘We were up all night with diarrhoea and vomiting and took her to hospital the following morning.

‘She was taken into a room and doctors tried several times to find a vein.

‘She was frightened and screaming and did not know what was going on.

‘After what seemed a lifetime in hospital and being on three different drip bags our little girl was allowed to leave but we were told to see her own doctor when we got home.'

Mr Todd said chefs at the hotel later used different utensils and special gloves for handling raw meat but the damage had been done.

He said: ‘We were really stressed and traumatised by our holiday from hell experience.

‘Helen is constantly worrying if Brooke is going to choke in the night again.

'We have even started to cut meat into small pieces to make sure it is cooked all the way through.

‘I am not sleeping well at all as I'm scared something will happen and I have been waking up having nightmares.’

Mr Todd also complained about the lack of promised gym facilities and the unavailability of some drinks on the all-inclusive package.

He said Thomson Holidays has offered him £130 ‘take it or leave it’ but he said he wants a full refund on the £1,200 holiday as well as compensation for having to eat out at cafes and restaurants.

A spokesman for Thomson Holidays said they were investigating the complaints.

He said: ‘Thomson is sorry to hear of Mr Todd's experience.

‘We have offered him a gesture of goodwill in relation to his complaints about quality and service.

‘Our legal team has also been in contact with him about the reported illness and are awaiting the return of the necessary documentation before they are able to complete their investigation.

‘We would like to reassure customers that we closely audit all the resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained.’
