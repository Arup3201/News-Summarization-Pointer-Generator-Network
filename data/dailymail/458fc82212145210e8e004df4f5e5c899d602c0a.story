Former pro-wrestler Hulk Hogan sued a disc jockey, the DJ's ex-wife and a gossip website today after a sex tape involving Hogan and the woman was posted online.

Hogan said in two lawsuits that he had consensual sex with his best friend's wife, Heather Clem, about six years ago in the Clems' home, but he did not know he was being secretly recorded.

'Mr Hogan had a reasonable expectation of his privacy, just as all Americans have a reasonable expectation of their privacy in their bedrooms,' attorney Charles Harder said.

The video was posted on the online 
gossip site Gawker. Hogan is seeking $100 million in damages from the 
New York-based media company, which declined comment.

It's unclear who gave the video to Gawker.

In the suit against the Clems, Hogan 
claimed the video caused 'severe and irreparable injury which cannot be 
adequately compensated by monetary damages'.

Hogan is seeking the rights to the video in both lawsuits.

Hogan, whose real name is Terry 
Bollea, wore a tight black T-shirt, jeans and dark sunglasses as 
he stood outside of the federal court in Tampa while his attorneys spoke
 to the media. He did not comment.

It's not clear whether Hogan and Bubba the Love Sponge Clem are still friends. The Clems have since divorced.

Hogan acknowledged on various TV talk
 shows recently that he had sex with Heather Clem while he was married 
to Linda Hogan. The Hogans have also divorced.

Hogan, his ex-wife and the couple's son and daughter have appeared on the reality show Hogan Knows Best.

Stephen Diaco, a lawyer for Clem, said Hogan was the best man at the Clem wedding and he is also a godfather to Clem's child.

'My hope is that these two can preserve their friendship,' said Diaco.

'I can't comment on the suit. This 
has caused harm to Bubba and he didn't release it, he didn't condone the
 release of it. He wants to find out who did that and he wants that 
person to be held accountable.'

It is illegal in Florida to record someone without their permission, but Hogan waited too long to file criminal charges.
