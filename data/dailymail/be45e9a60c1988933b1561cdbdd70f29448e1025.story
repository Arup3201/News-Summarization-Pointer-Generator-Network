Zara Phillips told Mike Tindall he was an 'idiot' when he splashed out on a £12,000 race horse at a charity auction.

Now the Queen's granddaughter may find herself eating humble pie her at Saturday's Grand National, where her husband's horse Monbeg Dude is tipped to win.

Rugby star Tindall was 'well-oiled', according to his Royal wife, at a Cheltenham auction in 2010 when he bid on the nine-year-old gelding.

But four years on the Princess and former
 Olympic silver medallist is even helping to train Monbeg Dude, a 14-1 
second favourite with bookmakers that a top mathematician believes will 
win the Grand National - according a formula he developed.

Part owner Mike Tindall bid for £12,000-horse Monbeg Dude at a charity auction four years ago. Now the nine-year-old gelding is a 14-1 second favourite for the Grand National and the top choice of mathematician William Hartston

'Idiot': Zara Phillips  and her husband, pictured here together at Cheltenham, disagreed over the choice to buy into the horse

Monbeg Dude is now worth a reported £200,000, after costing just £12,000

GoggleBox intellectual William Hartston, 66, spent days carefully studying the statistics from every single Grand National which has taken place since 1886.

He then used a complex formula which included the bookies' odds, age of the horse, the letters in the owner's name, and the letters and number of words in the horses' names.

And he concluded Monbeg, who is trained by Michael Scudamore and will be ridden by top jockey Paul Carberry, has the best chance of winning the race.

Hartston said: 'This year's scoring system is based on a re-analysis of the results of all Aintree Grand Nationals since 1886.

The man with the plan: William Hartston spent days carefully studying the statistics from every single Grand National which has taken place since 1886 to develop his formula - and he has Monbeg Dude coming out in front

She's warming to him! Zara Phillips even helps to train Monbeg Dude, who has raked in £122,245 in prize money from four race wins

According to a complicated mathematical model, Monbeg Dude is the hot favourite to win the Grand National

Points are awarded from one to four according to six criteria:

The last two items are added together and the sum then halved to give a single figure from 0 to 4 for the trainer's name.

The top-scoring horses using this system are as follows (points are then added depending on the odds offered by William Hill):

'Unlike last year, I have given a weighting towards recent years and added an item relating to the name of the trainer.

'I would have liked to include the name of the jockey too, but in many cases this is not available until the morning of the race.

'Had I been able to do so last year, Seabass would not have been my top choice: no jockey whose first name begins with K has ever won the Grand National, so Katie Walsh stood very little chance.

'Monbeg came top and looks like the best bet as far as I'm concerned.

'I love applying statistical techniques to everyday events.

Hartston is a Cambridge-educated mathematician and industrial psychologist who was a chess champion in the 1970s.

He
 has since become a TV boffin, applying statistics to the Miss Great 
Britain competition and is now a regular 'viewer' on Channel 4 show 
Gogglebox.

After 
calculating the points total for Saturday's runners and riders Hartston 
studied the odds and favourites with a team of experts from William 
Hill.

Get in! Rugby player Tindall, who according to his Royal wife was 'well oiled' when he bought into Monbeg Dude, will be hoping for similar joy at this Saturday's race meeting

Monbeg Dude's trainer Michael Scudamore says his team will need a 'bit more luck than just a mathematical formula to ensure a win'

The bookies' spokeswoman Kate Miller said: 'Monbeg Dude is the perfect age, level of talent, and stamina to make-up into a first-class Grand National contender.

'With the bookmakers already running scared, the 'perfect storm' of royal and sporting connections- will also ensure a hefty payout to punters if he wins on Saturday.

Monbeg Dude's trainer Michael Scudamore isn't quite buying into Hartston's model, preferring to look at his horse's form as a marker for Saturday's meeting.

'It being the Grand National, we're going to need a bit more luck than just a mathematical formula to ensure a win,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

Monbeg Dude has earned his connections £122,245, including four race wins, and is now worth a reported £200,000, according to the Daily Star.

A 103-year-old believed to be Britain’s oldest punter is hoping for a winner on this year’s Grand National - after betting on the race for more than seven decades without success.

George Atkinson said he is hoping to finally have a successful bet on the world-famous race, so he can 'die a happy man'.

Mr Atkinson has placed bets religiously on the Grand National each year since the 1940s.

George Atkinson, a 103-year-old who is believed to be Britain's oldest punter, is hoping for a winner on this year's Grand National - after betting on the race for more than seven decades without success

That's a lot of birthdays! George says he would 'die a happy man' if he finally wins this year

But he has never managed to back a winner, and fears the 2014 race is his last chance.

And after such a long run of betting, he has decided to pin his hopes on 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run, owned by Robert Waley-Cohen and trained by Nicky Henderson.

Mr Atkinson said: 'Any winner is nice - but the national would be a dream come true - I could die a happy man.'

The 103-year-old, from Swaffham, Norfolk, placed his first bet on the Grand National in the 1940s after leaving the Army.

He had placed his first ever bet when he was just 12, when his bookmaker grandfather took him to the Epsom Derby.

He said: 'I can’t remember the name as it lost - in fact they all lose. I’ve never even had a place.'I was once told to back Oxo in 1959 but I didn’t place a bet on it - it won and I’ve regretted it for 55 years.'

The Grand National is not the only competition Mr Atkinson has a flutter on - winning £301 from a £1 stake in 2013 by correctly predicting three of the numbers on the Irish Lottery.

'Horses are my favourite, but I love a dog race too,' he said. 'Number seven is my lucky number, but I’m not the luckiest punter.'

The widowed father-of-seven, who is a grandfather and great-grandfather, goes to his local branch of bookmaker William Hill in Swaffham twice a day and even celebrated his 103rd birthday there.

Believed to be Britain’s oldest punter, the company has given him a £103 bet - £51.50 each way - as he tries to fulfil his dream of a Grand National win.

He has decided to put it on Long Run - whose odds of winning are currently at 14/1 - and said: 'It has been a long run without a winner and it feels like my time.'

Happy punter: 'Horses are my favourite, but I love a dog race too'

William Hill took more than five million bets on the Grand National last year and is expected to accept over £30 million in wagers in 2014.

According to the bookmakers, around 57 per cent of Britain’s adult population is expected to place a bet on the Grand National, with 51 per cent of those who bet making their selection based on personal preferences.

Based on a survey of 2,066 people conducted for the firm by Populus, 36 per cent of people will choose a horse by name; 17 per cent make their selection by odds; 9 per cent will leave it purely to chance, and make a random selection; and just 2 per cent will pick because of the colours worn by the jockey.

Yvonne Dobinson, manager of William Hill Swaffham, said: 'George is living proof of how hard it is to win the Grand National with over 70 years failing to pick a winner.

'But he has picked a corker this year and even we will be cheering Long Run on for his sake.'
