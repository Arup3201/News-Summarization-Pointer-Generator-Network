They are the largest land predator on the planet and normally have a fearsome reputation as expertÂ  hunters.

But this polar bear showed she was actually a barrel of laughs when she grabbed hold of this plastic container and started performing tricks in front of astonished spectators.

Aurora, a six-year-old resident of Columbus Zoo in Ohio, spotted the blue barrel floating in the water.

Clearly an opportunity too good to be 
missed, the big bear bounded into the water and effortlessly tossed her 
new plaything on to dry land.

She then gently rolled the barrel to a safe spot on the ice, and gave her watching public a 10-minute demonstration of her agility when she carefully climbed on top and performed a balancing act one might normally associate with a circus elephant.

Valerie Abbott, a camera operator for Polar Bears International from Greensboro, North Carolina, was delighted to capture the moment.

The 55-year-old said: 'She was swimming 
in her exhibit and then decided to drag the barrel out, then she started
to attempt the balancing act.

'She balanced on the barrel for around ten seconds and I was delighted to see her do this.

'Polar bears, like all bears, have a very strong ability to balance.

'She played with the barrel for a good ten minutes and afterwards she dragged it back into the water and started pouncing on it.'

Ms Abbott has been watching polar bears closely for almost 20 years and has been a volunteer at her her local zoo in North Carolina since 1996.

She added: 'It's always a joy to see animals playing. I love all bears from the eight different species, but polar bears are my favourite.

'Through my photography I hope to bring to light their plight in the ecosystem and encourage others to help save them and this wonderful planet we all share.'
