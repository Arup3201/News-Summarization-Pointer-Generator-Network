A remote controlled car is not the first thing an African lion would expect to come across while hunting.

But this lioness decided to take a closer look when the tiny vehicle crossed her path in the wilds of Kenya - even taking a bite to see if it was worth eating.

The car, fitted with a special camera, was used by Australian photographer Chris Bray, 29, to get stunning close-up shots of wild animals during an African safari.

Curious: A lioness prods at a camera attached to a Â£40 remote-controlled car used by photographer Chris Bray, 29, to get close up images of wild animals

Inventive: The Australian cameraman assembled this stunning sequence of pictures as he was leading a two-week safari in Kenya

Taking a bite: The lioness takes a nibble on the car as she holds it between her huge paws

Bad taste: She does not seem to like the taste of the device as she licks her lips afterwards

The device was such a success that Mr Bray even managed to get a stunning image of the inside of a lion's mouth. The car got a little too close to an elephant which almost destroyed it by treading on it. 

But his pictures of inquisitive lions are perhaps the most endearing, as they capture the animals sniffing, pawing and biting the vehicle as they try to work out whether it was worth eating.

Lionesses usually do the hunting while male lions watch their young. They sneak up on their intended victims until they reach a distance of around 100ft or less.

A number of lionesses usually work together and encircle their intended prey before attacking them.

Paws: The camera captured close-up shots of a variety of creatures as they took a closer look. Here, a young lion bats the device with its paw

Bashed: The camera car took some heavy punishment from some of the animals - and was nearly crushed by an elephant

Their usual prey are a variety of types of large mammals, but they prefer wildebeest, impalas, zebras, buffalo, and warthogs in Africa.

Most lions live in eastern and southern Africa. Their population is in rapid decline - decreasing,by between 30 and 50 per cent during the last 20 years.

The African lion population ranges in estimated size between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild compared to up to 400,000 in 1950.

The decline has been fuelled by disease, hunting and other forms of human interference.
