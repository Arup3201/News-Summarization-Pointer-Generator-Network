Racial harassment charges against a woman who displayed a golliwog in her window have been dropped.

Jena Mason, a 65-year-old grandmother, was arrested after her black neighbour Rosemarie O'Donnell complained about the toy to police.

Today at Lowestoft Magistrates' Court, Chris McCann, head of the complex casework unit at the East of England Crown Prosecution Service, offered no evidence.

Charges dropped: Jena Mason, pictured at an earlier court hearing, will not now face a racial harassment case over putting a golliwog in the window of her manor house in Worlingham, Suffolk

Dispute: Rosemarie O'Donnell and her 
husband Stephen (right) had accused Mrs Mason, of 
harassment. Mrs O’Donnell complained that the golliwog was a racial taunt 
following a long dispute between the two households

In a hearing lasting less than five minutes, he said a 'review has been carried out at the highest level'.

Mrs
Mason, who did not attend today's hearing, had been due to stand trial 
after denying that she displayed an item likely to cause 
racially-aggravated harassment.

Mr McCann said Mrs O'Donnell and her husband Stephen had been informed.

He
said: 'To establish that an offence has been committed, it would have 
been necessary to prove that Jena Mason was the person who placed the 
doll in such a prominent position likely to cause her neighbours 
racially-aggravated harassment, alarm or distress.

Controversial: The golliwog was pictured in the window of Mrs Mason's home in Worlingham, Suffolk

'On the evidence available, it is not possible to show exactly who was responsible for placing the doll in the window.

'Despite
further inquiry and review, we have determined that the evidence is 
insufficient and there is not a realistic prospect of conviction.

'We
appreciate that this case has caused the O'Donnell family a great deal 
of upset and we have met with them to explain our reasons for not 
pursuing a prosecution.'

Outside
court, solicitor James Hartley said: 'I have spoken to Mrs Mason and 
she now wants to focus on rebuilding her relationship with her 
neighbours.'

The row erupted after a disagreement between the neighbours over plans by Mrs Mason and her husband Terry, who live in a listed 
manor house in the village of Worlingham in Suffolk, to build new stables on their land.

Their son-in-law, Daniel O’Dell, who 
also lives at the 16th century manor, is in training for the British 
Olympic dressage team and needs the space for his horses.

But the O’Donnells, who occupy a
£1million barn conversion behind a red-brick wall, hired a planning 
consultant to object to the application, citing boundary and 
right-of-way issues, traffic increase and problems from disposing of 
liquid and solid waste from the horses.

They have also complained about the Masons’ dogs allegedly coming on to their land.

Then the golly appeared in a ground floor annexe
window of the Masons' home near the main entrance to the barn.

Days after the local council granted 
planning permission, Mrs O’Donnell, 48, made a formal complaint to police 
about it, and supplied a photograph.

The businesswoman and mother of two, who has Jamaican roots, said the sight of it left her ‘shocked and upset’.

Mrs Mason was arrested, questioned at Lowestoft police station, charged and bailed.

The dispute centred around whether the golly was a deliberate act of racism – or, as Mrs Mason insisted, that it simply ended up on the window sill when she tidied it up with her grandson’s other toys.
