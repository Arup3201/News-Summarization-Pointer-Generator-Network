Tax avoidance: Anne Robinson, pictured, has avoided paying £4million after joining the Liberty tax strategy, it was claimed

Anne Robinson avoided paying tax on £4million after joining an aggressive scheme to shelter earnings from the Treasury, it was claimed yesterday.

The BBC Watchdog presenter was one of the largest participants in the Liberty tax strategy which enabled investors to pay just 7p in the pound to the company rather than 40 per cent income tax.

Take That stars Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen were also reported to be among the 2,000 who tried to shelter a total of £1.2billion from the taxman in the scheme between 2004 and 2008.

It is the latest revelation about legal but aggressive tax avoidance schemes used by celebrities and the super-rich which the Prime Minister has described as ‘morally repugnant’. HM Revenue and Customs believe that personal tax avoidance costs the economy £4.5billion a year.

Liberty exploited a loophole to buy and sell dividends offshore to generate more than £1billion in artificial losses which members could offset against their tax bills.

It meant higher-rate taxpayers could earn £1million a year tax free by paying £70,000 in fees to Leeds company Mercury Tax Strategies, which provided the scheme. Miss Robinson, 68, was reported to have avoided tax on about £4million through Liberty after paying £280,000 in fees.

Barlow attempted to shelter at least £3million after paying £210,000, Owen attempted to shelter at least £1.4million after paying £101,500, and Donald attempted to shelter £2.1million after paying £147,000. In total, Liberty was used to shelter an average of £300million a year between 2004 and 2008.

It was first investigated by the Inland Revenue 2006 and was eventually shut down in April 2008 when legislation was brought in to close the loophole.

Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is taking it to a tax tribunal in spring, but it is unclear whether any of the beneficiaries will be made to pay any avoided tax.

Comedian Jimmy Carr was forced to apologise earlier this year after it was revealed he put his earnings into a Jersey-based avoidance scheme called K2, which cut the income tax liability of participants to as little as one per cent.

The BBC, pictured in Salford, hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax

Miss Robinson has hosted BBC’s Watchdog for more than a decade, presenting herself as a crusader for ordinary consumers. She reportedly earned £6million for a two-year contract with the BBC for presenting The Weakest Link.

Yesterday it emerged that the BBC hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax. The arrangements include 148 news presenters such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman.

Mercury Tax Strategies, the provider of the Liberty scheme, declined to comment yesterday. Miss Robinson, Barlow, Donald and Owen all failed to respond to requests to comment.

HMRC said it couldn’t comment on individual cases. A spokesman said: ‘It does sometimes take a long time for cases to be investigated. This is why we advise anyone who thinks about using a tax avoidance scheme that they should be prepared to be subject to an in-depth enquiry.’
