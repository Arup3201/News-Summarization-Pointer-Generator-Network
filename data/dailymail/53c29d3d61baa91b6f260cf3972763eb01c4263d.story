Dr Shahid Ayyoun, 57, has been struck off by the General Medical Council after groping the breasts of a 22-year-old during a consultation 

A doctor who massaged a patient’s breasts with oil when she went to be treated for whiplash has been struck off.

Dr Shahid Ayyoub told the 22-year-old she had a muscular problem before lifting up her top and unclasping her bra.

The 57-year-old repeatedly stroked her breasts during the prolonged attack in a locked consultation room at the West Point Practice in Leeds.

He also grabbed the scared woman’s hair and pushed her head into his groin during the  50-minute appointment on 12 June 2012.

The woman, referred to as Patient A, was left feeling ‘violated and upset’ by the assault, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard.

The medic, who did not attend the hearing, instructed his solicitors to ask the MPTS panel to restrict his role - allowing him to conduct examinations in the presence of a chaperone or only seeing male patients.

But the panel said his actions were a 'gross abuse of trust in his position as a doctor', and was told he is no longer allowed to practise. 

Ayyoub worked for St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust in Merseyside before he was found guilty of sexual assault by a jury at Leeds Crown Court in January.

Judge Geoffrey Marson QC jailed him for 12 months but on appeal the sentence was reduced to six months.

The shamed medic, from Sutton Heath in St Helens, Merseyside, was also ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for seven years and pay £2,275 in costs.

Disgraced Ayyoub has now been struck off the medical register following a two-day  hearing in Manchester. 

But panel chairman Dr Brian Crompton said: ‘The offences for which Dr Ayyoub was convicted were serious in nature; they were sexually motivated; they took place in a clinical setting; and they involved a female patient who was consulting with him in order to assist her claim for compensation following a road traffic accident. 

Announcing the decision to strike Ayyoub off, he added: ‘In all the circumstances, the panel has concluded that the nature of Dr Ayyoub’s convictions is so serious as to be fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to be a registered medical practitioner.

‘For these reasons, the panel has determined that erasure is the only means of protecting patients, maintaining public confidence in the profession and declaring and upholding proper standards of conduct and behaviour.’

Stephen McNally, for the General Medical Council, earlier told the panel the doctor’s crimes had ‘brought the profession into disrepute.’

Opening the case, he explained how Ayyoub’s victim had consulted the medic as part of an insurance claim after suffering a car accident.

‘Dr Ayyoub expressed the view her symptoms were as a result of a muscular problem and said he would give her a massage to ease the pain,’ he said.  

The shamed medic also grabbed the scared woman’s hair and pushed her head into his groin during the 50-minute appointment at West Point Practice, Leeds, in 2012

After the attack, Ayyoub then left the room to speak to other waiting patients and the young woman realised the door had been locked, the panel heard.

‘When he returned he continued to massage Patient A and despite her saying she needed to leave he continued to massage her back and down her sides as previously,’ Mr McNally said.

‘He started to place his hands underneath her body and fully onto her chest and breast, rubbing his hands over her breasts down her body and onto her stomach.

‘He focused more and more on her breasts, stroking her breasts repeatedly, moving his hands down onto her stomach.’

By this time she was very uncomfortable, but the doctor continued despite her telling him she needed to go, the hearing was told.

Mr McNally added: ‘Patient A described that Dr Ayyoub grabbed her roughly by the hair and pushed her head towards his groin area.

‘At that stage she pulled away from him, got to her feet and said she had to leave.’

She was able to unlock the door and leave the room, and complained to the practice and police later that day.

In a statement produced in the crown court trial she said: ‘The incident initially left me feeling scared about what was going to happen.

‘I didn’t know what to do and didn’t feel like I could just get up and leave because he was a doctor and you put your trust in doctors.

‘It left me feeling violated and upset and I felt like I didn’t know what to do with myself.’

Ayyoub has 28 days to appeal the decision before he is struck off the medical register.
