The estranged wife of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling turned her romantic rival's words against her in court Friday, playing a recording that showed her husband showered V Stiviano with millions of dollars in gifts.

In closing arguments in the trial seeking the return of more than $2.8million in community property the Sterlings acquired over six decades of marriage, Shelly Sterling's lawyer relied on the words of Miss Stiviano to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy.

‘The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,’ Stiviano said in snippet.

‘That's it, that's over. End of case,’ attorney Pierce O'Donnell said.

Testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court wasn't as clear-cut even after Sterling's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks Donald Sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of Stiviano's $1.8million Spanish-style duplex near Beverly Hills.

A trick up her sleeve: Donald Sterling's wife, Shelly, had her lawyer play a recording in court Friday that showed her husband showered V Stiviano with millions of dollars in gifts

While an accountant for Sterling conservatively estimated that Stiviano got more than $3.6million in Sterling gifts that included a Ferrari and Paris shopping spree, O'Donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $1million in cash, saying the lower figure lined up with Stiviano's own admissions on the witness stand, depositions and court filings.

Judge Richard Fruin Jr, who didn't indicate how soon he would rule, had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the Sterling family's real estate company to Stiviano's bank accounts.

Defense lawyer Mac Nehoray reiterated that point in his closing argument. He attacked the credibility of witnesses, particularly Donald Sterling, who had suggested Stiviano got her name on the home title illegally because she was part Hispanic and had buddied up to a Hispanic banker and escrow officer. 

It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Donald Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers basketball games.

In the furor sparked when the remarks were made public, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2billion.

Nehoray spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law doesn't allow Shelly Sterling to go after a third party like Stiviano because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband.

Key witness: Stiviano was called to testify in the non-jury trial of a lawsuit brought by Donald Sterling's wife, which seeks the return of $3.6million 

‘Say he gave $2,000 to a call girl,’ Nehoray said. ‘Mrs. Sterling can't go and try to get that money back. We know that's not how it works.’

In her testimony earlier Friday, Stiviano painted two conflicting portraits of Sterling, saying from the witness stand that he was a kind, generous mentor and father figure to her but was a bigot who was mean to others.

She also testified that the 80-year-old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant, driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children.

‘We were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual. He became my everything and I became his all,’ she said, though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature.

Shelly Sterling, who accused Stiviano of fraud when she testified Wednesday, has painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and is now out to hurt him.

Stiviano, seen here outside the court Thursday, testified that tolerating Sterling's racist moments was 'part of the job' 

Stiviano has not disputed Donald Sterling's largesse, though she has quibbled with the sums at stake and has emphatically denied she used sex to manipulate him. She repeatedly testified that Sterling tried to manipulate her.

The apparent contradictions finally led Shelly Sterling's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, to confront Stiviano with the question: ‘Who is the real Donald Sterling?’

‘The real Donald Sterling is a con artist, a bigot ... he's mean, he's despicable,’ Stiviano replied, before quickly adding that to her, he was ‘kind, loving, sweet ... a mentor, a father. ... He treated me as he treated no one else.’

She added that tolerating his racist moments was 'part of the job' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family.

Stiviano broke down in tears as she described the Clippers owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys. 

Platonic relationship: The 32-year-old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the Clippers owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature 

She said, he said: Stiviano rejected the idea that she used sexual favors to manipulate the married billionaire and insisted that he was the one who tried to manipulate her 

In her testimony Friday, Miss Stiviano claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor, and she named a male friend of Sterling's who accompanied them on trips to Dubai, Paris and Thailand.

Shelly Sterling said outside court that the assertion was crazy, and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises Stiviano.

The judge allowed the testimony as Stiviano's lawyer tried to show where large, unexplained checks may have gone from Sterling's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $1.8million duplex, luxury cars, jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman Shelly Sterling asserts was his mistress.

Stiviano said she saw cashier's checks given to the man for $800,000 for a 'so-called business deal' involving a property in Los Angeles and a check for $75,000 to reimburse him for the Dubai travel.

Stiviano couldn't say if any of that money ended up in accounts identified as sources for the home purchase. She has denied that those were her bank accounts, and Sterling's lawyers couldn't make that connection.

The 32-year-old witness said she had worked for Sterling's charity and spent about 12 hours a day with him over more than two years, driving him to view real estate or attending Clippers meetings and games together.

She said he provided money, but it was not regular income — and that became a problem in late 2013 when she wanted a job. 'As long as you're with me side by side, I will take care of everything you need,' she said he assured her.

But Stiviano became suspicious when he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement. She said she was offended and refused twice to sign any such paperwork.

'I know how he works his trickery,' she said. 'I knew something wasn't right.'
