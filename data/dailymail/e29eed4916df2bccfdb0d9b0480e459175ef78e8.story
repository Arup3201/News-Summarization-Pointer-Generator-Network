From coffee to cigarettes, many of us have addictions.

But one woman is so addicted to cat food that she gorges on a staggering 900 kitty treats every single day.

Mary, 46, from Farwell, Michigan, began binging on the treats following a difficult divorce.

Mary is so addicted to cat food that she eats 900 kitty treats every single day

After the breakdown of her marriage, Mary (she does not reveal her surname in the programme) spent much of her time sitting around at home with her three cats and was tempted into trying a treat.

What started as an innocent urge to sample the cat food led to an addiction after Mary was left instantly hooked.

Her addiction began after she suffered a difficult divorce and spent much of her time alone with just her three cats

Mary spends a staggering amount of money of treats for herself every month and says they make her mouth water

'They just burst with flavour in your mouth and I love them' she said during an interview on My Strange Addiction, which premieres on Discovery Real Time tonight.

'When I start thinking about a certain flavour of cat treat, my mouth will water,' she said.

In the programme, Mary showcases a variety of her favourite flavours from treats with a cheesy centre to beefy flavoured biscuits that she awards '10 out of 10 for crunch factor'.

Speaking on the show, Mary's brother Tommy said: 'It's gross. There are four basic food groups and cat food is not one of them.'

Mary's brother Tommy says it is not healthy to eat the cat treats but Mary is addicted

Unemployed Mary spends $200 (£125) on cat food for herself every month, which she admits is more than she spends on human food.

She is sure to always keep a stash of the goodies in her car, purse and by her bedside table for late-night munchies, and she says she will even gorge on cat food at the expense of what she calls 'people food.'

'There have been days when I eat treats all day long and no people food,' she says.

'The cabinet just calls my name: "Mary come eat" and I will go sit on the deck and snack.'

‘My Strange Addiction’ premieres on Discovery Real Time on Tuesdays at 9.00pm and 9.30pm
