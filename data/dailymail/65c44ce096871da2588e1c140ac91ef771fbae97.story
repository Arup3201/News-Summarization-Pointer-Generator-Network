A man who attacked a woman with a samurai sword was tackled to the ground by a brave police officer.

After he was overpowered, a bag he was carrying was found to contain a bizarre arsenal, including a crossbow, samurai-type swords, hunting knives and gas masks.

An unarmed police sergeant, based in Islington, North London, went to the scene of the  random assault in Holloway Road early yesterday to find the victim, a 22-year-old Italian, bleeding heavily on the ground and a man brandishing a sword.

Scotland Yard said the officer chased the man along the road although the attacker made  several attempts to injure him.

A spokesman said: ‘The officer then turned, placing himself inside the samurai sword’s arc, and forced him to the ground.

‘It takes a very brave officer to tackle a  man who you know wants to inflict serious injuries to you with a samurai sword.

‘Courage such as this is above and beyond the call of duty.

‘I can’t commend the officer highly enough. The fact that he was unarmed and alone only underlines his bravery.’

Last night the woman, who suffered wounds to the legs, arms and face, was in a serious but not life-threatening condition in hospital.

Her parents have travelled from Italy  to be with her.

Residents living close to the scene in
Holloway Road, north London, described hearing a woman screaming 'like 
an animal' as she was slashed repeatedly with a two foot long sword.

Local resident Steven Oltay, 19, said he thought he heard the attack take place from his flat nearby.

He said: 'I was woken up last night by a woman screaming. Horrific screams, like an animal.

'I thought it was someone being murdered and almost ran out but decided against it.'

Ahla Timofei, 25, of Marylebone, central
London, is due to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court today 
charged with attempted murder.
