Meet the man whose hobby has gained him thousands of social media fans and a celebrity following - all through his witty doodles.

Scott Weston, 39, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, turns online musings into illustrations in a bid to be an ‘anti-troll’ and brighten up the day of fellow users.

He uses Twitter to choose one interesting tweet a day at random, and turns it into a unique doodle.

Pictured (left) is a doodle he created from Ricky Gervais (right) after the comedian tweeted about vacuuming a spider's web in his office

Using the handle @drawnyourtweet, Mr Weston then tweets his picture back to the writer, and shares it with the rest of his online followers.

This simple idea has snowballed and Mr Weston now has gained more 29,000 Twitter followers in just eight months.

He also has celebrity fans including comedian Ricky Gervais, actor William Shatner and singer Ellie Goulding - all of whom have received pictures from Mr Weston.

Mr Weston said: ‘I can’t believe the response I’ve had. I was inspired to first start doodling after reading random peoples’ tweets and visualising the images in my head.

‘I thought it would be a nice project, so I set up the address one evening and chose a tweet to draw,' said the artist. Pictured on the left-hand side is an image created for Ellie Goulding (right)

‘I drew a few doodles and sent them back to the original writer- some people were bemused but most loved it,' Mr Weston said. The project started as a hobby. This drawing shows a tweet of @nadineplease

‘By the first weekend, I’d had to turn my phone off due to the volume of alerts I was getting as people followed, responded and re-tweeted,' the Twitter artist said. Doodles inspired by tweets posted by @missshwe (left) and @tooapenny (right) are pictured

‘Philip Schofield, Ricky Gervais and Wil Wheaton have all shared and responded to my tweets.

'My particular claim to fame is that astronaut Commander Chris Hadfield marked one of my drawings as a favourite. It’s just spiralled.’

Mr Weston is delighted with the response to his pictures and he said: ‘I like my tweets to be light-hearted as the internet can be an anonymous and cold place. I’m like an ‘anti- troll’- I want to bring some sunshine to it’. This doodle depicts a tweet from @joetannenbaum

Mr Weston, who works a creative head of a digital agency in Birmingham, said: ‘I don’t do requests but I am more likely to draw a funny tweet from a follower'. Pictured is a sketch he created from Lauren Laverne's tweet about drinking coffee and listening to a 'cinematic orchestra'

And he has no shortage of material with his ever growing online fan base.

He said: ‘People can be so creative with what they say, and some tweets make great visual images.’

Mr Weston is now hoping to compile a book of all of his favourite Twitter illustrations.

He said: ‘From this small Twitter account, things have grown from here and it would be incredible if I could compile all of my doodles into a book, which would feature the original Tweets and make people laugh.’
