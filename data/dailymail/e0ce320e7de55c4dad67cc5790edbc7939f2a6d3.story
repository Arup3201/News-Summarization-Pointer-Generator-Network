Troubled teen star Justin Beiber caused uproar when he bought a Capuchin monkey, called Mally, for his 19th birthday, and was then forced to leave her stranded alone in German quarantine because he didn't have the correct paperwork to travel with her.

The instance raised the question of whether celebrities are viewing pets as mere accessories, without realising or being properly prepared for the huge responsibility they come with. Puppies, in particular, are proving popular with young stars.

Britney Spears, Tulisa and Jessie J have all got one, Millie Mackintosh is debating whether to get another, and the celebrity puppy craze looks set to continue - but according to new research, the majority are not properly prepared.

Puppy love: Celebrities such as Britney Spears often are seen wielding tiny pets, but a dog is a big commitment

Monkeying about: Justin Bieber was forced to leave his new pet monkey Mally in German customs, as he had failed to prepare the correct paperwork for her to travel

Despite nearly nine in ten dog-owners in the UK claiming that getting a puppy is like raising a child, the majority are not preparing themselves for the responsibility, according to a survey.

Moreover, 59 per cent of people quizzed by Adaptil admitted they were not completely prepared for their new arrival, and 55 per cent said the experience was more stressful than they had previously anticipated.

More than a third of the 2,000 dog-owners surveyed said they felt the same or more stressed than they did raising a puppy as they did raising a child.

Owners complained of doggy damage to their homes, with soiled carpets (77 per cent), chewed items (62 per cent), or torn sofas, carpets and walls (22 per cent) cited as the main problems.

Some 76 per cent of puppy owners waited less than two months between deciding to get a puppy and actually collecting their pet, while 21 per cent waited less than a fortnight.

Two-fifths did absolutely no research whatsoever, and among those who did the majority only researched costs such as vet fees, insurance payments and cost per breed.

Less than half looked into potential behaviour problems, and only two-fifths investigated which breeds were best with children.

And 17 per cent didn't socialise their puppy with other dogs at the start, as they were worried how it or other dogs would behave.

French fancy: Jessie J posted these snaps of her with her new French bulldog on Instagram, but many owners say they were surprised by the amount of work involved in caring for a pet

Three-fifths of those who did no research said they either thought they knew enough or felt they just didn't need it, while one in six said they 'just didn’t have time' to look up or ask for information.

While 85 per cent used the internet to find their information, only 23 per cent asked for the help of a professional such as a vet.

Sarah Endersby MRCVS, Vet Advisor for Adaptil, the pheromone calming product for dogs, said:  'It's clear from the research that owners are simply not equipping themselves with all the information necessary to bring up a puppy in a harmonious, healthy environment.

'For example, a quarter dealt with bad behaviour simply by shouting which can result in problematic behaviour as the puppy matures.'

Puppy-dog eyes: They made be adorable, but pets are a huge amount of work and responsibility

Adaptil is warning potential puppy owners to be cautious when deciding to get a puppy, and ensure they leave themselves as much time as possible to do their research and make their decision.

Sarah Endersby continued: 'Getting a puppy can completely transform your life and it's important to be aware of the changes it will cause.

'It is often compared to having a toddler in the house, and if you and your home are unprepared the situation can become extremely stressful. Sleepless nights, toilet training and behaviour problems - it's important to be prepared for them all!

'First of all investigate all the possible costs a new puppy may incur - ask yourself, can you afford it?

'Make sure you seek professional advice either from the Kennel Club, or your local vet so you are ready to train and socialise your puppy.

'Fully puppy-proof your home in the same way you would prepare for a new baby, and make sure you have invested in the right bed, collar, toys and food.'
