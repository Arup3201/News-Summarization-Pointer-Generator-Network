Imran Khan's new wife is in emotional turmoil after being trolled over her marriage to the Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician, a friend said today.

Former BBC weather girl Reham Khan married the 62-year-old last month in a secret ceremony that has provoked hostile reaction in Pakistan, online and from his own family.

Some social media users have accused Mrs Khan of being a lesbian and one image even claims to show her in a sex shop.

A producer at Dawn TV, a Pakistan-based private news channel where Mrs Khan works, today told MailOnline that the backlash had left the broadcaster 'very disturbed'.

The source said: 'She is not in the right state of mind after seeing the reaction of trolls on social media after news of her marriage with Imran Khan was disclosed.

'She has not been conducting her daily programme as well. She is very disturbed by the way she is being portrayed on social media.'  

It came as Mr Khan spoke out against the storm surrounding his  wedding, telling his critics that marriage is not a crime.

'A person can marry whenever he/she wants:' Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride after reaction to the marriage was negative in Pakistan and on social media

He confirmed last night that he had wed 41-year-old divorced mother-of-three days after his family said he had denied it.

His sister Aleena reacted with anger at the news, saying she doesn't want to meet the new Mrs Khan. 

But speaking from his home in Islamabad today, Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride, declaring: 'A person can marry whenever he/she wants.'

He pointed to the fact that he had in no way deceived his wife and insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision.  

The 62-year-old, who divorced heiress Jemima Goldsmith in 2004, said: 'I didn't think of my marriage for 10 years after my divorce because my children were small.

'I do not ever think of hurting my children's feelings.'

Reham Khan is understood to have moved into the house with her youngest daughter, according to her former colleague and friend.

The Daily Mail's diarist Sebastian Shakespeare broke the news of Khan's marriage to the broadcaster last week. 

On New Year's Eve, Mr Khan said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated' and his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it.

But speaking to reporters at Heathrow airport last night before boarding a flight to Pakistan, Khan is reported to have said: 'I am going to Pakistan to share good news about my marriage with the nation. I have nothing to hide.'  

Told by MailOnline that her brother had revealed he was actually married, Aleema Khan said: 'Really? Really? Let's see if he announces it officially. I am taken aback.  

Denial: Imran Khan's sister Aleema said the family had a showdown with the politician and he denied the secret marriage

'This is a real challenge for him. We haven't met her and I don't know that we want to meet her.

'It is his decision, he is a grown up. It is more important how the children feel. 

'I suppose in any situation like this the children will not feel good about it. They do look up to their father.' 

Speaking amid a political storm surrounding rumours of the marriage, she said she hoped Reham Khan 'will be good for Pakistan and our brother'.

She added: 'It all depends on how the public respond to it. The biggest surprise is how everybody in Pakistan feels they have a right to participate in the decision. 

'He is a grown man, we are watching the situation unfold.'   

Khan's new wife lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on the BBC regional news programme South Today.

Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor.

It is believed family members and those in his political party tried talking him out of the marriage.   

Online abusers also set up Facebook hate pages attacking the TV news anchor.

News of the  union sparked outrage in Pakistan and trolls have now accused Ms Khan of being a lesbian for stroking a woman's back, and attempted to shame her for going to parties.

Users have criticised her for wearing short skirts, lambasted her for dancing with unknown men in public, and branded her daughter a 'pornstar' while claiming to be in possession of topless pictures.

One image even claims to show Ms Khan in a sex shop in the UK wearing a pink nightdress, with a collar around her neck and a whip slung over her shoulder.

Among the images posted by online abusers was this photograph, which they claim shows Ms Khan in a sex shop, wearing a night dress, suspenders, a collar and with a whip over her shoulder

Mr Khan's sister Aleema earlier branded the reports of marriage lies, saying they had been concocted by Mr Khan's political enemies to damage his reputation.  

Online trolls have attacked Ms Khan for her appearance, dancing with unknown men, and attending parties

She told MailOnline: 'This is the only way the opposition know how to attack him. These are the tactics they would stoop to. It's out of control. I guess that is politics.

'I spoke to my brother a few days ago and he said it isn't true. 

'We, the family, just asked him outright, have you married her? And he said no. I don't know if they are in a relationship, here [in Pakistan] you are either getting married or you are not.

'We'd be extremely happy if he marries a good person and settles down, of course we would. But it is not just his consideration, it's a consideration for the country, it's like a national-level decision. 

'There are people in Pakistan who love him so much that everyone wants to participate in his private life, they feel he is their leader and should be part of his decision.

'Everybody [we, the family] are taken aback at how much other people want to participate in this decision.'

Asked if her brother is in a secret relationship with the TV broadcaster, she said: 'It's a confusing signal to everyone who follows him [but] we asked him if he was married and he said no. I don't know if he is in a relationship. We just asked him if he was married.' 

Reaction to the rumoured marriage had been very negative in Pakistan and there has been a backlash on social media. 

Photos of Reham in revealing clothes and a video of her doing a tango while working for the BBC are prompting insulting comments in the conservative Islamic country.

The 41-year-old lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on BBC regional news programme South Today 

Imran's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname 'Khan' and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry.

She said at the time: 'My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it's probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.'  

Imran married Ms Goldsmith in a traditional Islamic ceremony in Paris in 1995.

She had converted to Islam prior to their wedding and had learned Urdu and started to wear traditional Pakistani clothes.
