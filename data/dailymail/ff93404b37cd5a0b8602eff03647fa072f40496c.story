A father and physiotherapist who led a double life with two wives 7,000 miles apart has been jailed.

NHS worker Alexander Sarte, 45, of Ramsgate, Kent, was highly regarded in caring for the elderly at Kent and Canterbury Hospital in Canterbury, Kent - but has now been exposed as a bigamist.

His wife Donna McGowan decided to end their stormy seven-year marriage, and it emerged Sarte was playing the doting husband in Kent while still married to Naemi Gomez in his native Philippines.

He always smoothed over questions about his previous life when speaking to his second wife Mrs McGownan - mother of their two children, now aged four and seven, Canterbury Crown Court heard.

But when Mrs McGownan started divorce proceedings, officials in the Philippines told her that her husband had married Ms Gomez in 1998 - and they were still legally wed.

A shocked Mrs McGownan reported Sarte to police who charged him with bigamy. Sarte admitted the offence and was jailed for eight months last Thursday.

Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl told him he had been ‘deceitful and dishonest’ and caused significant upset to Mrs McGownan and their two children.

Sarte claimed to be single when he successfully applied for a work visa after arriving in the UK in 2003, the court heard.

He met his second wife as they worked as health care workers in Broadstairs, Kent, and they married in 2005 - two months before his work visa ran out.

He told Mrs McGownanhe he had children with a woman in the Philippines - but never said he was previously married. He also told police he had married Mrs McGownan ‘for love’ and not to get a resident's visa.

But she said he was a ‘controlling’ husband who emotionally abused her and treated her like a child during their tempestuous seven-year marriage.

'There has to be a whiff that this might have been a marriage of convenience to allow him to remain in the UK. But this marriage last seven years and they have two children'

Martin Bowyer, defending

‘There has to be a whiff that this might have been a marriage of convenience to allow him to remain in the UK,’ Martin Bowyer, defending, said.

‘But this marriage last seven years and they have two children, now aged four and seven. Although he accepts it wasn't always a happy marriage it was nonetheless a marriage. He doesn't accept everything that Donna has said.’

He added that the Philippines was a Catholic country where divorces are ‘extremely difficult’ to obtain compared to the UK and carried ‘considerable cultural shame’.

He said: ‘Since coming to the UK he has always worked within the NHS service caring for the elderly and is an intelligent man.’
