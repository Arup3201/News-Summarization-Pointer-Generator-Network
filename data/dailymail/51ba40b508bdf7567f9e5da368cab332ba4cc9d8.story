Positive signs: Nelson Mandela is 'showing great improvement', according to his ex-wife

Nelson Mandela is responding to touch and trying to open his eyes, his daughter said today, adding: 'He's still there.'

The former South African president is said to be on life support after his condition deteriorated over the past few days, but a government spokesman said that he 'improved' overnight and is now 'stable'.

His eldest daughter Makaziwe said that when she went to see him in hospital this morning he was still responsive and conscious.

'I won't lie, it doesn't look good,' she told SABC. 'But if we speak to him, he responds and tries to open his eyes. He's still there. He might be waning off, but he's still there.'

Mr Mandela's granddaughter Ndileka said he was 'stable', and thanked the well-wishers from around the world who have sent their support.

The whole family was said to be summoned to his bedside today, and president Jacob Zuma was believed to have been seen entering the hospital.

'I cancelled my visit to Mozambique today so that I can see him and confer with the doctors,' Mr Zuma said in a statement. 'He is much better today than he was when I saw him last night.'

In the Eastern Cape 
province, where Mr Mandela grew up, a traditional leader said that the time was 
near for the former leader, who is also known by his clan name, Madiba.

'I am of the view that if Madiba is 
no longer enjoying life, and is on life support systems, and is not 
appreciating what is happening around him, I think the good Lord should 
take the decision to put him out of his suffering,' said the tribal 
chief, Phathekile Holomisa.

'I did speak to two of his family 
members, and of course, they are in a lot of pain, and wish that a 
miracle might happen, that he recovers again, and he becomes his old 
self again,' he said.

'But at the same time they are aware there is a limit to what miracles you can have.'

Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj 
told the state broadcaster: 'Over the past 48 hours, the condition of 
former president Madiba has gone down.'

A South African newspaper has also reported the icon is on life support, citing numerous sources close to the family.

The Citizen newspaper says Mr Mandela has a team of doctors supporting him at a Pretoria hospital.

One source was quoted as saying that his family had the option to switch off the ventilator.Â

Mr
 Zuma cancelled a trip to neighbouring Mozambique, intensifying 
speculation about the deterioration of Mr Mandela's condition.

The president made his decision not to leave the country after visiting the 94-year-old late yesterday in the Pretoria hospital where he has been receiving treatment for a lung infection for nearly three weeks.

'Clearly the issue of seriousness has been such that President Jacob Zuma has cancelled his trip,' Mr Maharaj told Talk Radio 702.

He declined to comment on reports that Mandela was on life support, saying: 'I cannot confirm any clinical details.'

CNN also reported that the former president could no longer breathe unaided, quoting an official who 'had been briefed in detail on his condition'.

George Bizos, one of Mr Mandela's closest friends and his former lawyer, told The Daily Telegraph that they had never discussed his wishes towards the end of his life.

'We
 can only hope for the best, and that is what the doctors decide to do,'
 he said. 'I am sure that the members of the family are discussing the 
matter with the doctors but it should probably be primarily the doctors 
in consultation with the family if the situation is critical.'

Last night a leading clergyman visited Nelson Mandela's bedside to offer prayers for his 'peaceful, perfect end'.

Thabo Makgoba, the Archbishop of Cape
 Town, issued an emotional statement asking that the former president of
 South Africa, who is in a critical condition, be released from pain and
 suffering.

However, Mr 
Mandela apparently opened his eyes and smiled when he was told about 
Barack Obama's forthcoming visit to the country, according to his 
daughter.

Mr Makgoba posted a message on Facebook asked for courage to be granted to
 Mr Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, and others who love him 'at this hard 
time of watching and waiting'.

He added: 'May your blessing rest upon Madiba now and always. Grant him, we pray, a quiet night and a peaceful, perfect, end.

'Uphold all of us with your steadfast love so that we
 may be filled with gratitude for all the good that he has done for us 
and for our nation, and may honour his legacy through our lives.'

Waiting: The balance of Obama's Africa trip could hang on the health of Mr Mandela

The statesman was able to 
show his pleasure at hearing of the U.S. President's visit.

Mr
 Obama is believed to be keen to meet Mr Mandela, but given the delicate
 condition of the African leader he will not do so unless he is invited 
by the Mandela family.

That prospect appeared to be more 
likely after Mr Mandela's daughter Zindzi described how she 
told her father that Mr Obama would be touring South Africa.

After she told him 'Obama is coming,' she said, 'He opened his eyes and gave me a smile.'

The
 U.S. President arrived in Senegal yesterday and will travel to South 
Africa on Friday during his second trip to Africa since taking office.

Speaking in Dakar today, Mr Obama paid tribute to Mr Mandela and insisted his visit to South Africa would go ahead matter what.

He said that the anti-apartheid campaigner had helped inspire him to enter politics with his bravery and self-sacrifice.

'I think he's a hero for the world,' Mr Obama said. 'And if and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages.'

Mr
 Mandela has been in hospital being treated for a lung infection since 
June 8, and over the weekend his condition was downgraded from 'serious'
 to 'critical'.

Close 
relatives of the 94-year-old held an emergency meeting on Tuesday at the 
former anti-apartheid leader's home in Qunu, in the Eastern Cape.

As fears for Mr Mandela's health worsen, well-wishers have flocked to the hospital to leave letters, cards and flowers along the outside of the building.

Among
 the cards were handwritten notes from schoolchildren thanking the 
inspirational leader who helped bring an end to apartheid in South 
Africa.

The security wall at the hospital has now been transformed in to a homage to Mandela - 
who spent 27 years in prison because of his activism.

One of the messages read: 'We love you Mandela. God bless you'.

Another read: 'We love you Tata Mandela. I am still young, I still need to see you. Get better. Tino.'

Other well-wishers have travelled to Nelson Mandela's home in a Johannesburg suburb to pray for the 94-year-old.

hope you come. I love you Mandela,' Thembi Magagula said outside 
Mandela's home in Houghton.

Mr Mandela, who became South Africa's
 first black president after the end of apartheid in 1994, was 
hospitalised for a recurring lung infection. This is his fourth 
hospitalisation since December.

Mandela
 was jailed for 27 years under white racist rule and was released 23 
years ago, in 1990. He then played a leading role in steering the 
divided country from the apartheid era to an all-race democracy.

As a result of his sacrifice and peacemaking efforts, he is seen by many around the world as a symbol of reconciliation.
