A Left-wing former presenter of a teenage TV show will join Newsnight as a contributor.

June Sarpong, 36, who once dated Labour MP David Lammy and has supported the party atan election rally, will work on one-off projects for the flagship current affairs show.

Newsnight editor Ian Katz denied she had been given a permanent contract for the programmebut said she ‘may contribute occasional films’.

She will 
be the latest in a string of Left-wing journalists to work for Newsnight
 following the arrival of Mr Katz last year from the Left-leaning 
Guardian newspaper.

Miss
 Sarpong presented Channel 4’s teenage strand T4 for nine years. In 
2005, she was pictured alongside Tony Blair and Gordon Brown at a Labour
 election rally.

Betting on who will replace Jeremy Paxman as the main presenter on Newsnight was suspended yesterday
 by bookmakers Paddy Power and Ladbrokes after a flurry of late bets on 
Krishnan Guru-Murthy, 44, the Channel 4 News presenter.

Bookmakers believe well placed BBC staff who know who is being lined up to replace Paxman have cashed in on their information by putting money on the outcome.

Presenter: Miss Sarpong, pictured with presenter Vernon Kay, once dated Labour MP David Lammy and has supported the party at an election rally. She will work on one-off projects for the flagship current affairs show.

Favourite: Mr Guru-Murthy - who had been thought unlikely to take over the flagship show - is now favourite to replace Paxman when he leaves next month. Above, the Channel 4 presenter at the RTS TV awards

In the 
past two days, bookmaker Paddy Power said it has seen dozens of 
‘industry insiders’ set up online gambling accounts and place bets on Mr
 Guru-Murthy.

It
 means the Channel 4 news presenter – who had been thought unlikely to 
take over the flagship show – is now favourite to replace Paxman, 64, 
when he leaves next month.

A 
spokesman for Paddy Power refused to say who the industry insiders were,
 but said the firm is so confident Mr Guru-Murthy, 44, will take on the 
job it is no longer taking bets on the announcement.

He said: ‘There are no rules against an insider using their knowledge to make money off us. It is just a risk we have to take when we accept bets on something.

Contenders: Other favourites to replace Jeremy Paxman are Eddie Mair (left) and Laura Kuenssberg (right)

‘But as soon as we spotted the trend we suspended betting. It is a clear sign there has been a leak.’Ladbrokes also said it has suspended betting after Mr Guru-Murthy’s odds dropped from 50-1 to 16-1 in less than a week. 

He
 added: ‘A series of maximum bets of £100 were placed on Krishnan plus 
there have been several new accounts opened, which all adds up to us 
smelling a rat. All of the bets on him are London-based.’

The BBC refused to comment on Paxman’s replacement yesterday, and would not confirm his exact departure date.

Another controversy: In 2009 bookmakers suspended betting on the next Doctor Who after a flurry of late bets on Matt Smith led his odds to drop

Mr Guru-Murthy has experience at Newsnight already, having worked there as a producer and reporter for three years before joining Channel 4 in 1998.

Another 
favourite to replace the veteran host is Radio 4 presenter Eddie Mair, 
who impressed bosses last year when he grilled London mayor Boris 
Johnson while standing in on the Andrew Marr show.

Laura
 Kuenssberg – who joined Newsnight earlier this year from ITV – is also 
in the running to take over the helm, as is Emily Maitlis.

This is not the first time the BBC has been caught up in a betting controversy over a major announcement.

In
 2009 bookmakers suspended betting on the next Doctor Who after a flurry
 of late bets on Matt Smith led his odds to drop from 31-1 to 1-3 
favourite.

Some suspected BBC insiders had placed bets on the announcement, although others suggested friends of the actor - who went on the play the Time Lord for four years – may have been to blame.

Last year, bookmakers Coral said it suspected insiders on BBC2 show The Great British Bake Off were responsible for a flurry of bets on the eventual winner, Frances Quinn.

As the final is pre-recorded, those involved in the filming knew the result in advance.

Paxman announced he was quitting Newsnight last month. He said: ‘I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people.’
