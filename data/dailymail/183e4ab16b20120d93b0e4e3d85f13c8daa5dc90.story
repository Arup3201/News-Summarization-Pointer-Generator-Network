Police arrested a man for suspected drink-driving after he crashed his small car-based van into the side of a police station. 

The 49-year-old man collided into the side of Frodsham police station in Cheshire at 12.20am today. 

It is believed the man lost control of his Ford Fiesta van as it 'rolled' off a car park into the side of the police station.

The suspect hit the side of Frodsham Police Station in Cheshire, pictured, at 12.20am today 

Officers arrested the man on suspicion of drink driving, and then tweeted a photograph of the incident on the Cheshire police official Twitter feed.

Cheshire police released two tweets about the incident: “Man arrested for #drinkdrive after losing control on a car park and crashing into Frodsham police station. #epicfail”, and: “Male in Frodsham kindly handed himself in for drink driving #drivenintostationwall”

The Ford Fiesta suffered a crumpled bonnet as it smashed through a fence and dropped into a hole beside the police station.  

A 49-year-old man is currently on bail. 

According to the Chester Chronicle PC Adam Norton was on duty inside the station which is between Runcorn and Ellesmere Port, when he heard a crunch. 

PC Norton's colleague PC Greg Thompson said: 'There’s no major damage, no structural damage, he has just pushed the fence out of the post.' 

A spokesperson for Cheshire police said: 'At 12.20am on Friday 2 January 2015, a vehicle rolled down an incline and collided with the side of Frodsham Police Station.

'There was some damage to the car but the occupants of the car were not injured.

'The building does not appear to have been damaged.'
