When James Dyson reinvented the hand dryer, everyone was surprised at how such as a simple concept could work so effectively.

Now one New York-based company is planning to replicate the success of Dyson's AirBlade, but for the entire body.

The ‘Body Dryer’ group has been working on a design to eliminate the use of towels completely by pushing water off the body in around 30 seconds.

 Air is drawn in from outside the Body Dryer device and stored in a pressurised chamber.

After enough air has been collected, it’s blasted out from nozzles in the foot plate.

The arrangement of the nozzles creates a column of air that swirls around the body.

The air emits negative ions causing water molecules to divide into smaller particles that evaporate faster.

The device, which is slightly larger than a set of home scales, pushes highly-compressed ionised air up towards the body at various angles.

Luckily the temperature can be adjusted to blow warm air on colder days and cold air during the summer months.

‘The idea for the body dryer came after feeling like I was never truly clean after reusing a towel,’ the creators wrote on their website.

‘We looked at the evolution of hand drying systems in bathrooms and saw a natural progression with body drying.’

Air is drawn in from outside the Body Dryer device and stored in a pressurised chamber, according to a report in Digital Trends. 

After enough air has been collected, it’s blasted out from nozzles in the foot plate.

The arrangement of the nozzles creates a column of air that swirls around the body, providing what the company claims is a more hygienic drying process.

Currently the device only exists as a prototype, but its developers are planning on launching an IndieGoGo campaign in April to help finance large-scale production.

If enough funds are raised, Body Dryer is expected to sell for $250 (£150). Early contributors to the crowd funding campaign will be able to get one for just $125 (£75).
