For a tournament that started so well for Xabi Alonso, the 2014 World Cup turned into such a nightmare that the Spain midfielder needed a break to get away from the game.

The Real Madrid star has enjoyed a holiday between Spain's unexpected group stage exit in Brazil and the start of the new season by spending time away with his wife, Nagore Aramburu.

It wasn't all as a result of Spain's early exit though as the couple were staying at the Hotel Spendido in Portofino to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary.

Alonso, 32,Â  made use of the facilities around him as he sat on a sun lounger, but also kept the exercise up with a swim in the pool.

The former Liverpool midfielder scored Spain's opening goal as they took a 1-0 lead over Holland in their first World Cup game, but it would be a match his side would go on to lose 5-1.

The world and European champions would then suffer defeat their second game to Chile, ensuring they would be the first team to exit the tournament long with Australia, who they defeated 3-0 in the final group game.
