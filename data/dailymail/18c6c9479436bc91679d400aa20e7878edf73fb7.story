A girl aged nine suffered a fractured skull in a horrific accident yesterday when she veered off a ski slope ‘like a rocket’ and smashed into a hut.

India Furness lost control on an icy slope and crashed through a safety net and a wooden fence before hurtling through the hut’s window.

She was airlifted to hospital in a coma but regained consciousness and doctors said her injuries were severe but not life-threatening.

Crash landing:The girl flew through this ski hut window after losing control on the slopes

An emergency medic said she was 
travelling at about 30mph but her  helmet probably saved her life in the
terrifying crash on Austria’s highest mountain, the Grossglockner.

India was on the second day of a 
family holiday in the Tyrolean resort of Goldried, near Innsbruck, with 
her parents and two older sisters. The family were skiing together when 
the accident happened.

Officials said the family, from Cerne
Abbas, Dorset, were on a steep ‘black’ piste – the most difficult ski 
rating – when India appeared to lose control.

The schoolgirl hurtled down the slope
and careered into the disused wooden cabin, smashing through the 
first-floor window and across the room before coming to a halt on the 
far side of the hut, 16ft from the shattered window.

Her parents and 
sisters raced to her side and her father Nigel, 50,  a landscape 
designer, and mother Helen, 45, a caterer, called rescuers from the 
slope.

Medics found the child slumped 
unconscious against the hut wall. She was taken to Innsbruck University 
Hospital, where she was last night in intensive care.

Dr Wolfgang Kratzer, who treated her 
in the helicopter, said: ‘Judging by how far she was inside the hut, she
was going way too fast. She must have flown through the window like a 
rocket.’

He added: ‘She would have been 
travelling at at least 50km per hour [30mph]. She has  woken from her 
coma and the prognosis is good. There are no signs of brain injury.

‘She was very lucky. She had good 
equipment. Her ski  helmet saved her life.’ Officials said the family 
were competent skiers but icy conditions had made the slope particularly
difficult. Police are investigating the accident but said no one else 
appeared to have been involved and conditions were clear.

Police spokesman Walter Moser said: 
‘The snow is extremely icy at the moment. It makes it very difficult to 
slow down and she seems to have picked up too much speed and lost 
control as a result.’

India was holidaying with her parents and sisters, Scarlet, 14, and Alice, 12.

Mr Furness is a parish councillor in 
Cerne Abbas, best known for the ancient chalk figure of a 180ft naked 
man carved into a hillside.

Neighbours described Mr and Mrs 
Furness and their daughters as a ‘lovely family’, well known in the 
village, where they run a catering business.

India’s accident is the latest in a series of incidents involving British skiers recently.

Ed How, 37, a Charterhouse School 
teacher, died in Val d’Isere last month, a week  after Thomas Lynch, 22,
from Leicestershire, was killed  when he crashed into a snow-making 
cannon, also in the French Alps.

In February, Tracy Boland, 46, from Marlow in Buckinghamshire, died in Austria after colliding with another skier.
