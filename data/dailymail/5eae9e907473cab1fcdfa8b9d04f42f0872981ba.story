James Rodriguez and Colombia have arrived in the Big Smoke and are primed and ready to take on the USA.

The 2014 World Cup Golden Boot winner - Rodriguez bagged six goals and two assists in Brazil - will be looking to help his side overcome USMNT at Fulham's Craven Cottage on Friday night.

The Colombia players took time out of their schedule in London - they are training at Queens Park Rangers' Harlington base - to pose for a photo with their arms folded.

Players including Rodriguez, Fiorentina's Juan Cuadrado, as well as Porto's Jackson Martinez and Juan Quintero, looked happy but focused ahead of the clash.

And this despite the absence of Manchester United's on-loan striker Radamel Falcao, who was left out of the squad due to injury.

Jurgen Klinsmann's USA, meanwhile, have brought a mixture of experience and experiment for the game.

Sunderland's Jozy Altidore has 24 goals from 74 caps, while DaMarcus Beasley has played 120 times for the US.

Jordan Morris, 20, however, is a student at Stanford University and Miguel Ibarra plys his trade in the North America Soccer League for Minnesota United.
