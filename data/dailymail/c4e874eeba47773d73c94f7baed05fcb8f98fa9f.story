This is the biggest home TV ever made to watch at home – with a huge 110in screen. The vast panel has been likened to looking through a window and will be on sale from next spring.

It is one of the new generation of supersize ultra high-definition TVs which promise astonishing picture clarity.

The set, unveiled by Samsung at a trade fair in Berlin yesterday, has four times the number of pixels on a current HD set, showing images in more detail.

For those who cannot wait, the 98in S9 version has just gone on sale in Britain for £40,000.

However, there are smaller models with screens of 50-60ins with more modest price tags of around £5,000.

Next year’s football World Cup in Brazil will be the first major event to be broadcast in full Ultra HD to viewers in Japan, while the Rugby World Cup in England in 2015 will be the first in the UK.

The screen is so big that players in sports matches will appear almost life-size to viewers

Consumer electronics guru, Barry Fox, said the images on the new sets are extremely impressive, offering a far better experience than 3D.

‘The pictures are mind-blowing, it is like looking through a window,’ he said.

The set was unveiled by Samsung’s Michael Zoeller, senior director of European sales and marketing, among a number of new innovations at an industry tech show in Berlin.

He said the screen is so big that players would appear almost life-size to viewers during a football match.

‘This looks stunning. The screen in nearly 2.5 metres across,’ he said.

Samsung's S9C features a giant 55-inch curved screen to give viewers a cinema experience in their living room. It also offers a MultiView feature that allows two people to watch different shows at the same time

The South Korean electronics giant also unveiled a television that allows two people to watch different shows
at the same time.

The S9C features a giant 55-inch curved screen to give
viewers a cinema experience in their living room.

The television, expected to cost around £7,000, boasts a
cutting-edge OLED screen - offering the ‘amazing’ MultiView feature.

The Mutli-view feature is hoped to put an end to arguments over the remote control

Viewers wear special glasses that pick up one piece of
content at a time, with audio delivered through a built-in earpiece.

‘Two people can watch two different programmes at the same
time in full screen in full HD and even in 3D with Samsung MultiView glasses,’
said Zoeller.

‘It is like having two televisions in one.’

A spokesperson for the company was unable to confirm when it will be on sale in the UK.

The group has finally unveiled its Galaxy Gear smartwatch and revealed a 'slimmer, lighter, faster' Galaxy Note 3 phablet yesterday.

The surprisingly sleek wrist-mounted device has a solid touchscreen, runs Android apps and can sync with a smartphone to make phone calls and access the web.

The Galaxy Gear comes in six colours and will be available from 25 September. It will cost $299 in the U.S but UK pricing has not been announced.

Another TV in the range, the S9 OLED television, features a curved screen, which Samsung claims makes the viewer feel like they are 'standing in an arena'
