Dismissed: Major Robert Armstrong escaped a jail term but was dismissed from the Army for keeping top secret documents at home

A decorated Army Major has been dismissed from the forces for keeping top secret documents at home.

The documents, along with a gun and 
ammunition, were found when Major Robert Armstrong's service quarters in
Lisburn, Co Antrim, were raided in 2009.

The 38-year-old had been subject to an investigation into 
allegations that he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for bravery in Afghanistan based on 
exaggerated claims.

Armstrong, of the Royal Artillery, did not have his MC pinned to his uniform for the sentence hearing at Colchester Military Court yesterday.

He listened as prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Callum Cowx told the court that the documents included 43 confidential, 114 secret and two top 
secret, the most sensitive class of information, files.

A further 23 
documents were not protectively marked but were potentially sensitive.

Mr Cowx added: 'If some of the documents 
fell into the wrong hands, it could have had dire consequences for 
national security.'

The charges relate to possession of the documents, an inoperable Glock pistol, 273 rounds of ammunition and a morphine injector, issued to all personnel for use in theatre.

When interviewed by military police, Armstrong said he transferred the documents to his personal laptop so he could work on them at home.

He accepted that secure alternatives were available to him, Mr Cowx said.

The gun, which had belonged to an Iraqi policeman who died in a bomb attack, was badly fire-damaged and could not be discharged, he claimed.

Along with the ammunition, it had been placed in storage and recently returned to him as he moved into new accommodation.

He had forgotten the items were there and
was 'taken aback' when they were discovered in the search in May 2009, 
Paul Colhoun said in mitigation.

Discovery: 182 secret documents, a gun and ammunition, were found during a 2009 raid on Armstrong's quarters in Lisburn, Co Antrim

Mr Colhoun said: 'There was nothing untoward or sinister about his possession of these items, other than his own oversight.

'There has been no leakage of the information in his possession.'

He added that Armstrong, who was of previous good character, was made major in 2006 after joining the Army in 1998.

He had served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Cyprus, Germany and Northern Ireland.

Armstrong was awarded the MC in March
2009 - two months before his arrest - for 'consistent bravery and 
inspirational leadership' in Afghanistan.

The court had heard a criminal 
investigation had been launched into how information relating to that 
investigation was passed from the Ministry of Defence to the press.

Mr
Colhoun asked that that investigation be disregarded in relation to 
sentencing as the inquiry was continuing and he is currently entitled to
wear it.

He added: 'Along with the 
administrative inquiry by the chain of command, I understand there is a 
criminal investigation into how information was passed from the MoD to, I
believe, the Sun newspaper.'

Armstrong has served as an instructor with the Royal School of Artillery since his arrest.

After two-and-a-half hours of deliberation, a court martial board imposed a year sentence suspended for two years.

They also ruled he was not fit to continue service in the Army and would be immediately dismissed.

Judge Jeff Blackett described Armstrong as an 'outstanding field soldier'.

But he added: 'There was no doubt that you knew you should not have retained these items.

'You have taken a very cavalier attitude to the handling of dangerous and potentially very damaging material.'

He added that the documents could have threatened the 'internal security of the UK' and led to 'widespread loss of life'.
