Porn baron: Steven Hirsch  poses with Savanna Samson, one of his Vivid Entertainment stars. Hirsch, who has made millions from hardcore pornography films for the internet, reportedly approached Chandler  

Last month Chandler claimed that the most decorated Olympian of all time pursued her on Tinder – but that they are no longer an item.

Phelps has yet to comment on Chandler’s claims. 

Chandler, claims to have had a romance with the US athlete, 12 years her junior, before he went into rehab in September and that they became involved after he approached her on the dating app.

However, such is Phelps' fame, that she wasn't sure if the messages were coming from a made-up account.

I'm yelling Tinder: A look at Phelps' alleged Tinder profile, which is how he and Chandler first met

She told The Daily Beast's Aurora Snow: 'He pursued me [on Tinder]. He was actually outside the age range for what my account was setup for. But what I've learned is when someone looks at whatever and likes you, even if they're younger it shows up in your feed.

'But at the time I just didn't think it was real. You just figure it's fake.'

Chandler explained that once they'd met up, their relationship seemed quite serious.

She said: 'We talked about the fact that I wasn't looking to get involved with someone unless it was serious. I'm not ugly, so its not like men don't approach me, but I wanted something real. And it felt real with him. I've been to his house four times, we talk everyday, and I've slept with him more than once.'

Chandler admitted on a Facebook post that she'd been born an 'intersex' - someone who had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries

The blonde says that she had a fulfilling sex life with Phelps, who made her feel 'like the most beautiful woman in the world'.

The pair are no longer together, but for reasons that Chandler won't disclose.

She insists that the split is not because she was forced to admit her past, and says that the reason  is for Phelps to disclose.

Chandler admitted on a Facebook post that she'd been born an 'intersex' – someone who had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries - with the name David Roy Fitch.

She later had surgery. 

She wrote: 'I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.

'There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.'

She had previously detailed their first date, to a Baltimore Ravens games, to the National Enquirer.

'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview.

'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.'

She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up.

Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland.

The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident.

On Friday Phelps pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and received 18 months of supervised probation and a one-year suspended jail sentence.

The 18-time Olympic gold medalist was arrested for drunken driving early on September 30 after speeding and then crossing the double yellow lines inside a Baltimore tunnel, police said.

'The last three months of my life have been some of the hardest times I've ever gone through, some of the biggest learning experiences I've ever had,' Phelps, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, told reporters.

'I'm happy to be moving forward. I'll continue to grow from this.'

Phelps, 29, was clocked by radar at around 1:40 a.m. traveling 84 miles per hour (135 kph) in a 45-mph (72-kph) zone, police said, adding that he blew a .14 on a Breathalyzer, nearly twice the legal limit of .08 in Maryland.

He faced up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

'I hope we don't have this conversation again and I'm optimistic that we won't have this conversation again,' Judge Nathan Braverman told Phelps during his sentencing. 

Police said an officer followed Phelps' 2014 Land Rover onto northbound Interstate 95, through the Fort McHenry Tunnel, and pulled him over just beyond the tunnel's toll plaza.

The drunken-driving arrest was the second for Phelps, who has spent most his life working feverishly in the pool but admits he likes to have a good time when not competing.

Following his arrest, Phelps, who is eyeing a spot on the U.S. team for the 2016 Olympics, was suspended for six months by USA Swimming and barred from representing the United States at the 2015 FINA World Swimming Championships in Russia.

Phelps said he completed a 45-day rehab program at an Arizona treatment center following his arrest, continues aftercare in Baltimore, and will participate in Alcoholics Anonymous.
