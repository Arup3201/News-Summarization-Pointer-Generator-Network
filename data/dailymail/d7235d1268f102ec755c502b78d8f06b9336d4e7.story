It looks more like a lush green meadow than a popular coastal resort, and with tonnes and tonnes of tangled seaweed lining the shores and floating on the water, would you really want to take a swim?

It seems that nothing will deter these sunseekers from having a fun day in the sun in China.

These pictures show beachgoers frolicking in swathes of green algae on the beach in Qingdao in the eastern Shandong province.

Fancy a swim? A sun seeker on the beach at Qindao, China, relaxes on a pile of the green algae that has swamped the popular patch of coastline

Healthy and happy: Not only is this woman reaping the benefits of the healthy seaweed - she is also staying healthy by keeping out of the sun

Green eyed monster: this man has been buried in the non-toxic algae by his friends as they play in the seaweed

Swamped: The popular and normally picturesque stretch of coastline has already seen tonnes of the green stuff removed

Covered: An aerial view of the algae covered Qingdao beach in China

Around 20,000 tonnes of the stuff has already been removed from the beach in the last few days with the coast swamped in green since early last month.

But the algae is likely to do no harm to those swimming in it - it is non poisonous Enteromorpha prolifera, an edible seaweed which is even praised for its health benefits.

The form of algae, also known as sea lettuce, is said to be rich in magnesium and many other nutrients, a vitamin-rich food source that can help improve skin and lower blood pressure.

But clean up teams will have to work quickly to clean up the green stuff, before it decomposes and begins to rot - for sea lettuce can produce large quantities of hydrogen sulphide, a toxic gas.

Healthy: Not only is the seaweed said to be non-toxic, it is also lauded for its health benefits and is edible

Is it a bird? As if swimming in the stuff isn't bad enough, this young swimmer launches a load of seaweed through the air at his friend

Taking a stroll: You'd be forgiven for thinking that this woman was walking across a lush meadow, she is in fact ankle deep in algae swathed sea water

Relaxing: This child looks delighted to be playing in the algae, perhaps because it is good for him

As well as being nutritious for humans, the algae is also a source of sustenance for sea creatures including manatees.

More than 10,000 volunteers helped clear the same coastline back in 2008 when the beach - which was due to host the Beijing Olympic sailing events - was swamped by some 20 square miles of algae.

The government even had to step in to ensure that the Qingdao sailing venue was ready in time for the games, sending in soldiers to help clear it up.

This particular type of seaweed can grow up to 50cm in length, typically growing near the shore, on rocks or other algae, on open coasts or in estuaries and harbours.

Officials have blamed warm seas for bringing in the algae in the past, but many scientists blame pollution for the phenomenon.

Some experts say that the algae blooms in water with high levels of nutrients blaming farmers using too much fertiliser on their crops and cities falling to treat sewage properly.

Come on in, the water's lovely: A swimmer's head pokes through a luscious green surface that resembles a swamp more than a picturesque coast

Safe and stylish: This women may look as though they are about to rob a bank, but they are in fact just shielding their faces from the glare of the sun

Staying safe: The nylon masks were invented by a local designer some eight years ago and have become increasingly popular since

Double benefits: The masks also protect wearers from being stung by jellyfish

Not only were beachgoers able to reap the rewards of bathing in tonnes of healthy seaweed, but some also went to extreme measures to ensure their skin wasn't damaged by the sun.

Many beach goers donned bizarre looking nylon masks designed to protect wearers from the glare of the sun's rays so that they don't have to wear sun cream.

The masks are the brainchild of a local designer and have become increasingly popular since they were launched around eight years ago.

The sea port city of Qingdao is famous for its beaches, which are noted for their clear water, mild waves and soft sand.

The beautiful scenery and their European feel are also compared to Hawaii, Bali or Samet Island in Thailand.
