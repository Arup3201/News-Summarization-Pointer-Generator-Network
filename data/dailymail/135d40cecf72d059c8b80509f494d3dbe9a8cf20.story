Manchester City claimed second place from Southampton with a comfortable win at St Mary's.

All three goals came in the second half, starting with Yaya Toure's deflected strike, then Frank Lampard off the bench and finally the unlikely source Gael Clichy, expertly played in by Sergio Aguero.

Sportsmail's Neil Ashton was at St Mary's and rates all the players' performances.

SOUTHAMPTON 

Fraser Forster: Unsighted when Yaya Toure shot from the edge of the area and most likely beaten by a deflection. No chance with the other two. 6

Nathaniel Clyne: Attacking options restricted, he had his hands full keeping an eye on Samir Nasri. Another steady performance. 6

Jose Fonte: Got away scott-free when he tripped Aguero inside the penalty area. Should have been penalty. Recovered. 6

Toby Alderweireld: Moved into midfield at start of second half, speculative effort wide of Hart’s post. 6.5

Ryan Bertrand: Southampton rely heavily on their two full backs to bomb on, but City strangle teams. 6

Steven Davis: An influential and key member of this Saints team, full of running and bursts forward. 7

Victor Wanyama: Booked for an early challenge. Southampton missed Jack Cork in the centre of midfield, they could have done with him here. 5

Morgan Schneiderlin: Ineffective for a change, possibly injured. Replaced by Yoshida at half-time. 5

Dusan Tadic: Desperate to create an impression against the champions, provided the odd moment of inspiration. 6

Graziano Pelle: Caught in a sandwich between Kompany and Mangala, found it difficult to create space. Strength and power is not the way to beat these two. 6

Sadio Mane: Outstanding down the left, he was the biggest threat for Southampton in the first half. Subbed. 6

Morgan Schneiderlin wasn't his self for Southampton and was replaced, likely injured, at half-time

Substitutes 

Maya Yoshida (Schneiderlin 46) Came on at half time to play alongside Fonte, never got close to stopping either City goal. Not his fault. 6.5

Shane Long (Mane 67): Worked hard, but Saints’ talisman could not come up with an equaliser. 6

Emannuel Mayuka (Davis 82) Too little too late to make an impression. Saints were already 0-2 down. 6

Subs: Kelvin Davis, Florin Gardos, Harrison Reed, Matt Targett.  

Manager - RONALD KOEMAN: Big test ahead for the Saints manager now. With City down to ten they conceded twice: Arsenal and Manchester United are up next.4

MANCHESTER CITY

Joe Hart: Looked like he was in for a busy afternoon after being bombarded with crosses. Dealt with them well. 7.5

Pablo Zabaleta: Love his passion, love his tenacity, love his enthusiasm for the game. Narrowly beaten to MOTM award by Kompany. 7.5

Vincent Kompany: Classy performance by the City defender. Far more composed and assured than his central defensive partner Mangala. Without him they cannot compete for title. Taken off injured a minute from time, which is a worry. 8 

Vincent Kompany is Sportsmail's star man for his composure at the back for City but worryingly limped off

Eliaquim Mangala: There should be an investigation by the Fraud Office into how this guy cost £32m. Unforgivable to pay this amount. It seems impossible on the evidence so far. Sent off. Dreadful. 1

Gael Clichy: Couple of hoofed clearances in the second half under pressure; he’ s better than that. Otherwise steady and reliable, scored three minutes from time. 7.5

Jesus Navas: Couple of nice slalom runs into Southampton’s half. Takes care of business when he is on the ball. Sacrificed for Demichelis. 7

Fernandinho: Rugged, hardworking performance in the centre. Knew he would be in for a game from Steven Davis and he got one. 7.5

Yaya Toure: Appears disinterested during most games but is liable to set up or score the winner. Mobbed by team-mates when he scored the winner, says it all about his match-winning qualities. 7

Samir Nasri: Lovely threaded ball for Jovetic in the first half, pace on it just right. Can make the impossible possible when he is in possession. 7

Stevan Jovetic: Decent effort off the line by Alderweireld. Always going to be the fall guy and he was here. 6.5

Sergio Aguero: Bizarrely booked for diving under Jose Fonte challenge when he actually should have won a penalty. Entitled to be infuriated. 7 

Sergio Aguero is fouled in the penalty area but his theatrics in going down saw him booked for diving

Substitutions

James Milner (Jovetic 55): Decent effort side footed over the cross bar after 64 minutes. Put in a shift as usual 7

Frank Lampard (Nasri 65): Lampard wants to stay at City for the rest of the season and he will do. Scored a beaut to seal it. 7

Martin Dimichelis (Navas 75): Brought on to steady the ship. Argeument he should have been on from the start. 6

Subs not used: Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna, Fernando, Jose Angel Pozo  

Manager - Manuel Pellegrini: Calm and unflustered on the touchline, the champions did a number on Southampton here. 8

Referee - Mike Jones: Disastrous start booking Aguero, but improved slightly. Got the bookings of Mangala in each half correct, which is saying something based on this dreadful performance. 6
