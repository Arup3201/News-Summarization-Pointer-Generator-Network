Witness: Tom Crowe, 18, told the court how the accused, Elliot Turner, 'practised strangling him'

The son of a wealthy jeweller accused of strangling his girlfriend in bed had practised the technique on his friend just days earlier, a court heard today.

Elliot Turner, 20, allegedly killed aspiring model Emily Longley, 17, in a jealous rage at his parents’ home before they allegedly helped him cover up the murder.

Today his friend Tom Crowe, 18, told the court that days before the blonde teenager’s death, Turner practised strangling him so hard 'he started to panic'.

He also said that before Emily was killed, Turner even claimed he had already murdered her by clubbing her round the head with a hammer.

The jury has heard Turner became jealous because he suspected she had been having affairs during their four month relationship.

Mr Crowe said: 'Elliot and me had gone to a local park and he was saying Emily had really done it this time and was seeing other blokes.

'He said: "How shall I do it Tom? How shall I kill her, mate?"

'He looked lively and was taking short paces. I said: "I wouldn’t know, I’m not a murderer."

'He was coming up with ideas about whether he should set her on fire with petrol in his bedroom or drown her.

'My reaction was to think: "Christ, you’re nuts. That’s insane".

'He also mentioned a drugs overdose or whether she would choke on her own vomit if she got really drunk.

'Then we were joking around and having some horse play when we started wrestling.

'I gave a demonstration of how wrestlers strangle each other on the TV show Smack Down but I couldn’t get my arm around his neck.

'He is very muscular, powerful and strong because he drinks protein shakes and goes to the gym.

'He took hold of me the same way and put a lot of pressure on my throat and I started to panic.

'I was struggling and said: "Can you get off". I held my breath and tapped him on the arm to let go.

'He stopped and we had a joke about it.'

Victim: Emily Longley was 17 when she died, allegedly at the hands of boyfriend Elliot Turner

On trial: Elliot Turner is charged with the murder of girlfriend Emily Longley

Accused: Leigh Turner, 53, and his wife Anita are charged with obstructing the course of justice

Emily, a student from Auckland, was found dead in Turner’s bed at the house in Bournemouth, Dorset, on May 7 last year.

Winchester Crown Court heard Turner 'flipped out' and killed her during a drunken argument.

Jurors were told he had become increasingly suspicious and jealous during their relationship.

Emily changed her Facebook profile picture from one of them together during a three-week holiday to New Zealand in April.

He
then allegedly left a message on a friend’s voicemail saying: 'She 
changed it to her flirting with some other lads and made me look like a 
knob.'

Mr Crowe referred to Turner and their group of social friends as ‘The Firm'.

He added that on April 30 Turner told friends he had battered Emily six or seven times in the head with a hammer and killed her.

He
said: 'Elliot said he found out Emily was going to a nightclub on a 
date with another boy, Louis Powell, by looking through her Facebook and
phone messages.

'We drove 
to Klute mightclub in Bournemouth and on the way he was very angry and 
aggressive, banging the steering wheel and speeding.

'He had a hammer and said he was going to batter her and the boy to death with it.

'He put the hammer in his trousers and went in the club while I waited in his car.'

Crowe said: 'After three hours he came out and he was in tears and said he had done something awful.

'He said he had hit her six or seven times with the hammer and killed her.

'He was very convincing, I was in shock. He said he was going to hand himself in to police.

'We then picked up our friend and he told him the same story.

'But then he said: "only joking" and he stopped crying and was cheerful, jumping up and down.

'I was really annoyed with him because I thought he had actually killed her and had led me on.'

Investigation: Emily was found dead at Elliot Turner's £300,000 family home

The
court heard Turner later threatened to kill the blonde teenager with a 
lump hammer and boasted to her 'I will go to prison for it and still be a
millionaire when I come out.'

After
the murder Turner is said to have written a letter of confession but it
was ruined with bleach by his father, Leigh Turner, 54 to 'destroy 
vital evidence.'

Turner was arrested following her death but then released on bail.

Jurors
heard a police bug of the £350,000 Turner home in the affluent Queens 
Park area recorded the family talking about 'fabricating evidence and 
being worried about lying to police.'

Strangled: Emily Longley who was allegedly killed after Elliot Turner, 20, became suspicious that she was having affairs

The
court was told that after the death, Turner’s mother, Anita, 51, 
removed from the house a coat her son had worn on the night aspiring 
model Emily’s death.

Police
scans of computers seized from the home found Google searches for 
‘death by strangulation’ and ‘how to get out of being charged for 
murder.’

Officers made a 
series of recordings at the Turners’ home between May 18 and June 14 
last year. They then arrested the three family members and charged them 
in July.

The court heard 
pathologists who examined Emily’s body found injuries consistent with 
asphyxiation, Turner had scratches on his arm and Emily had his DNA 
under her fingertips.

Emily was born in Britain but her family emigrated to New Zealand when she was nine and she was raised in Auckland.

She
had returned to live with her grandparents in Bournemouth, to study for
a business national diploma at Brockenhurst College, Hants, and worked 
part-time at Top Shop in Bournemouth.

She was also signed up to a modelling agency and had appeared on the front page of a magazine in New Zealand.

Elliot Turner denies murder and perverting the course of justice. His parents both deny perverting the course of justice.

The trial continues.
