This is the moment a £120,000-a-week Premier League footballer received an unexpected delivery from above.

Manchester United midfielder Ashley Young was ranting at his team’s sloppy defence during their 2-1 defeat to Swansea City yesterday afternoon when bird excrement appeared to land in his mouth.

In images captured by BT Sport that quickly spread on Twitter, the bird’s delivery landed right on the inside of the 29-year-old England international's lower lip from quite some distance away.

Among those to spot the incident were Match of the Day presenter and former England footballer Gary Lineker, 53, who retweeted a Vine clip called ‘Bird s*** on Ashley Young’s mouth’.

Journalist Rob Dawson said: 'Ashley Young was at fault for a goal, appears to have had bird muck fired in his mouth and has now hurt his shoulder. Not a good day.'

Account Pablo Dominguez added: 'The bird pooping in Ashley Young's mouth was definitely today's highlight.'

And US cartoonist Rob Torneo said: 'So a bird just pooped in Ashley Young's mouth. Who says soccer is boring?'

New United boss Louis van Gaal's first Premier League game in charge of his team ended in a 2-1 defeat to Swansea, with his side looking well short of title material.

Gylfi Sigurdsson, back at Swansea after signing from Tottenham Hotspur, fired in the 72nd minute winner to stun the hosts who had drawn level through Wayne Rooney shortly after halftime.

After an encouraging pre-season there was a renewed air of confidence around Old Trafford as fans looked for a winning start from Dutchman Van Gaal and his much heralded 3-5-2 formation.

But by half-time the mood had changed with United trailing and the formation abandoned after 45 minutes of slow and shapeless football.

United looked little improved on the team that finished seventh last season, although the absence of striker Robin van Persie and several others through injury clearly hampered them.
