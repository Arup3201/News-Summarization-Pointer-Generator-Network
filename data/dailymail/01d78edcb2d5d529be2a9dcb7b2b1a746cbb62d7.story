Jaguar today dispelled the myth that cats don’t like water – by designing a speedboat to go with its latest car.

It unveiled the prototype craft to showcase the towing ability of its new Jaguar XF Sportbrake estate which hit the road today and will arrive in showrooms and driveways from late November.

Jaguar design director Ian Callum explained: 'The Concept Speedboat by Jaguar Cars’ showcases the design DNA of the British premium luxury and sports car manufacturer in an unexpected and spectacular package.

Concept: Jaguar has designed a speedboat to showcase the towing ability of its new Sportbrake estate

Luxury: The fibreglass hull is finished with teak decking in classic nautical style

‘We recognise that both our existing and future customers enjoy diverse and active lifestyles. With the launch of the new Jaguar XF Sportbrake, we had an opportunity to create a vision of how our design philosophy might be applied to an alternative product, in which speed and beauty are also priorities.

‘It looks powerful. It follows, in so many ways, the idea of a traditional speedboat but with the sleek and fast characteristics that you would expect from a Jaguar car.’

To create the sleek speedboat, Jaguar consulted with specialists Ivan Erdevicki Naval Architecture & Yacht Design Inc, and Seventy Seven Design

The Jaguar Speedboat has a gel coat 
fibreglass hull topped with teak decking. This is split by a carbon 
fibre fin, inspired by the  legendary Jaguar D-Type.

Demand: The work put into the boat suggests Jaguar may consider putting the prototype into production

Design philosophy: Both the car and the boat are aimed at customers with 'active lifestyles'

Iconic: The fin behind the boat's cockpit evokes memories of Jaguar's classic D-Type car

Mr Callum said: ’The front of the boat flows seamlessly into the screen and the red 2+1 cabin follows the sporting character of Jaguar cars. ‘

Jaguar’s automotive heritage is also subtly recognised with fuel filler caps inspired by the first generation of the XJ saloon.  A polished aluminium propeller and pop-up mooring post show how the boat could be powered and docked respectively.

Although officially spoken of as a ‘styling exercise’, the degree of work put into the project suggests that Jaguar could be persuaded to build the craft if demand for it is sufficient.

Waterline length: 17 ft, 5in

Mr Callum said: ’I hope our design inspires people to think about our products in a much broader sense, especially in lifestyle and enjoyment.  I have always had a passion to create such an object and it seemed fitting that we relate this to a lifestyle vehicle such as the Jaguar XF Sportbrake.  The two sit together perfectly.’

The new Jaguar XF Sportbrake estate is priced from £31,940 for the 2.2litre 163 horse-power diesel up to  £51,505 for the top of the range 3.0litre V6 diesel S with 275 horse-power, which propels it from rest to 60mph in  6.1 seconds to a top speed artificially restricted to 155mph.

The rear wheels are driven via an eight-speed automatic gearbox.
