These are the adorable images of a set of polar bear cubs seeing the world for the first time.

Despite temperatures reaching -50C, the excitable cubs played in the snow - even during a blizzard - rolling around and climbing on top of their mother.

Photographer Andy Skillen tracked down the family at Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada, and followed the family for two days.

Tumble: It takes time to learn to keep your balance! Wildlife photographer Andy Skillen spent two days following the bears at Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada

Drowsy: According to Mr Skillen, the polar bears had recently resurfaced after spending the winter in hibernation

The area is famous for its polar bear dens, and Mr Slkillen managed to capture a set of heart-warming scenes.

In the region, most polar bears build their dens around November and come out of hibernation in February.

The photographer said that most bears in the park, hungry after months of being in their dens, are anxious to get hunting seals before the spring thaw.

Having excitable young bears in tow, though, makes things a little trickier.

He said: 'It's a fascinating scene to watch unfold.

'Polar bears live in a world of extremes, and yet despite their fearsome reputation show a remarkably touching side.

'They are programmed to survive like no other animal on earth, and the sheer enormity of the tasks these mothers have to take on every couple of years is beyond belief.

'I have the utmost respect for all animals that can make a living in the Arctic, and bears top the lot.'

Safe: The cubs enjoyed their first taste of freedom but they never went too far from their protective mother
