A disgraced former investment banker who pleaded guilty to insider trading has begged the judge for a lenient sentence in a Manhattan court, saying he only stole to help support his love child.

Frank 'Perk' Hixon, Jr, 55, who is due to be sentenced Friday, told the judge that his ex-girlfriend and mother of his daughter was 'too proud' to accept money - but apparently happily accepted investment advice.

A lawyer for Hixon, who has been married for 26 years to Marguerite Lammot Lee, wrote in a letter to Judge Ronnie Abrams that his client's crimes were committed out of love for his illegitimate daughter, and not greed.

Hixon's crimes 'pale in comparison to the pervasive, calculated and economically-driven conduct of defendants such as Raj Rajaratnam,' William F. Johnson argued.

Hixon was also charged with using inside information to trade in his father's account.

Prosecutors are asking for 46-to-57 months in prison, reports the New York Post.

He was a managing director at Evercore until January when he was fired following his arrest.

He pleaded guilty to five counts of securities fraud and one count of making false statements to federal agents for crimes that occurred between October 2011 and January 2013.

Hixon claims the mother of his daughter, Destiny Robinson, would not accept his child support checks for their daughter who was born in 2008, but she was happy to receive investment advice.

He 
committed the fraud in a misguided attempt to remain in contact with his
 daughter, who was conceived during a two-year extramarital 
relationship, reports Bloomberg.

'Her pride would allow her to accept his investment ideas, but not his checks,' Johnson said in the court filing.

So he set up an account in her name and used his inside knowledge to make trades on her behalf.

When he was arrested, there was almost $1 million in the account, reports the New York Post.

'Mr. Hixonâ€™s actions were a misguided expression of love and support for his younger daughter, whom he desperately feared losing,' Johnson argued.

Despite is indiscretions and illegal activity, Hixon's wife says she wants to move forward with her husband.

'I know that Perk deeply regrets the actions that have brought him before you, and that he is embarked on the hard work necessary to rectify them,' Lee wrote in to Judge Abrams, adding that a lenghthy prison sentence would prevent the couple of 26 years from being able to 'heal.'
