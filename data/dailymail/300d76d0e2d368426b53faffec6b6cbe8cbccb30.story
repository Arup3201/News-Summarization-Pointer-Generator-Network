The Borough President of Staten Island has some choice words for one of the most historic humanitarian organizations in the nation, calling their reaction - or lack thereof - to the devastation caused by Sandy an 'absolute disgrace'.

James Molinaro blasted the Red Cross this morning at a press conference telling people not to donate to the charity because when push came to shove, the group just didn't deliver when Staten Island needed them the most.

'My advice to the people of Staten Island is do not donate to the American Red Cross,' said Mr Molinaro. 'Let them get their money elsewhere.'

He balked at the so-called bloated salaries of the workers as well as their seeming indifference to the people of Staten Island's plight.

'It's an absolute disgrace in a county that has always responded to disasters all over the world,' he said.

'Katrina - we sent them down four trailer loads of food, water and one trailer load of generators. No one's responding to us.'

Of the 22 people across New York City that have perished, 15 of them died in Staten Island. The borough is still underwater.

'You know, I went to a shelter Monday night after the storm. People were coming in with no socks, with no shoes. They were in desperate need,' the passionate politician said.

'Their housing was destroyed. They were crying. Where was the Red Cross? Isn’t that their function? They collect millions of dollars. Whenever there’s a drive in Staten Island, we give openly and honestly. Where are they? Where are they?'

He continued: ' They’re supposed to be here….They should be on the front lines fighting, and helping the people.'

Other Staten Island politicians also felt the response to Staten Island was lackluster.

'It is as the borough president, Jim Molinaro, said, it’s disgusting, it really is,' State Senator Andy Lanza said to the New York Observer.

He questioned the city's decision to give the go-ahead on to the New York Marathon when so many residents are in need and there is so much work to be done.

'There are people who are cold, who are hungry, who are without a place to go, and looking for warmth. There are people still trapped. Yet we’re talking about marathons.'

The Red Cross said that the city coordinates disaster response, not them. The National Guard has been called in to aide the area, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced this morning.
