America's most experienced fighter pilot flew 151 combat missions around the world -- bravely attracting enemy fire so he could seek out and destroy enemy weapons.

Lt Col Dan Hampton sat in the cockpit of a F-16 fighter plane for 20 years, logging more than 600 combat hours -- helping to secure the skies over Iraq and to protect American airspace after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

He recounts his harrowing career in the US Air Force in his autobiography 'Viper Pilot: A Memoir Of Air Combat.'

During
 his tours of duty, he witnessed first-hand some of the most historical 
moments of the U.S. armed services, including helping to hunt down 
Saddam Hussein during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.

From 1986 to 2006, Hampton flew missions as a leading member of the Wild 
Weasels, an elite Air Force fighter squadron whose mission is widely accepted as 
the most dangerous job in modern air combat.

'It was time for this story,' Hampton 
said in a statement released by his publisher. 'No grand designs or 
philosophical fluff - just an honest view of life and war from one 
fighter cockpit.'

In the 20 years Hapton spent as a pilot, he flew 151 combat 
missions, made 21 hard kills on surface-to-air-missile sites, received 
four 
Distinguished Flying Crosses with Valor and one Purple Heart.

Hampton writes about his experiences in the squadron, in which he piloted the first planes sent 
into war zones, flying deep behind enemy lines purposely seeking to draw fire 
from surface-to-air missiles and artillery.

'They must skillfully evade being 
shot down and then return to destroy the threats, thereby making the skies safe 
for everyone else to follow,' reads the release. 'Today these vital missions are more hazardous than 
direct air-to-air engagement with enemy aircraft.'

Hampton's record number of 
strikes on high-value targets make him the most lethal Wild Weasel pilot in 
American history.

Hampton logged twenty years and 
more than 600 combat hours in the world's most iconic fighter jet: the F-16 'Fighting 
Falcon' - or the 'Viper', as pilots call it.

Hampton helped spearhead the 2003 invasion 
of Iraq, leading the first flight of fighters over the border en route to strike 
Baghdad. Among his targets were Saddam Hussein's suspected hide-out and his escape helicopters, which he personally destroyed.

Legend: The pilot racked up 20 years, 151 combat missions, 21 kills, 12 medals and one Purple Heart

He shares stories
from Iraq of saving ground soldiers from certain death, evading
heat-seeking missiles locked on his tail, and of being wounded in a
terrorist attack.

The 
retired pilot also relives the morning of 9/11 when he and his F-16 took
 to the skies above the United States and played a crucial role
in the unprecedented act of closing America’s airspace. Hampton, under 
orders to shoot down any plane that did not identify itself, helped 
escort a Delta Airlines flight to the ground that day.

But given the paranoid atmosphere of that terrible day, he writes, 'we were fortunate that no one got shot down.'

He
 adds: 'It always surprises me how bloodthirsty the ground-pounders seem
 to be. One controller told me that he'd "give me clearance to fire..." -
 all I had to do was ask.'

Memoir: Hampton has recounted many of his most memorable experiences in his autobiography

Hampton 
was also responsible for calming down an over-excited air traffic 
controller in Charlotte, North Carolina who declared a 'free-fire zone' 
for 20 miles around the city in response to a helicopter with its lights
 out landing men on the ground.

The 
quick-thinking captain soon realised that the chopper had probably been 
sent out by the Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, and ordered a 
colleague to contact the base to ensure that the Air Force did not 
accidentally shoot down U.S. troops.

Hampton also reveals what it takes psychologically to have 'the
right stuff'.

The author's memoir is already getting early praise.

'Hampton
 is not shy about recounting brushes with death,' read a Kirkus review. 
'The author concentrates on the fighting and does a fine job 
communicating the camaraderie and hair-raising incidents of service in 
the elite macho fraternity of American fighter pilots.'

Published by HarperCollins, Viper Pilot comes out on October 2.
