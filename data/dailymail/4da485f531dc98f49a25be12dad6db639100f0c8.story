An outrageous £3million Lamborghini launched this year has been named the ugliest car in history.

The Lamborghini Veneno is a limited edition supercar which made its world début at the recent Geneva Motor Show.

Just three are being made and they have already been snapped up by wealthy customers who loved the radical design.

'Worst thing out of Italy since fascism': The Lamborghini Veneno, a limited edition supercar which made its world début at the recent Geneva Motor Show, has been judged the ugliest car ever

Limited edition: Just three are being made and they have already been snapped up by wealthy customers who loved the radical design

Outrageous: The car, which has a top speed of 221mph, was judged the ugliest by a popular car website

'Mercifully, only three will be made': The site says it contains ever supercar cliche and ever bad idea Lamborghini have ever come up with

But the Lamborghini clearly is not to 
everybody's taste with the 221mph model this week named the ugliest ever
car by Edmonds, a popular automotive website.

The website said: 'Every supercar cliché and every bad idea Lamborghini ever had, stuffed into one overpriced showcar.

'It's the worst thing out of Italy since fascism. Mercifully, only three will be made, which is still three too many.'

The 1977 Lincoln Versailles came 
second, followed by the 2010 Acura ZDX with the 1985 Cadillac Deville 
and 2001 Pontiac Aztek making up the top five respectively.

Britain
also appeared on the list with the 1976 Rolls-Royce Camargue ranked 
11th while the controversial Aston Martin Lagonda - also from 1976 - 
came in 17th.

The Ferrari California, a huge success for the Italian supercar firm, was a surprising entrant, coming in at number 16.

Second place runner up: The 1977 Lincoln Versailles came second in the top ten of ugliest cars

Very plain: The 2010 Acura ZDX, which came third. The 1985 Cadillac Deville and 2001 Pontiac Aztek came in fourth and fifth places respectively

Sixth: The 1998 Fiat Multipla was criticised, with the website claiming it looked as if 'it escaped from Neptune, bounced around the solar system hitting asteroids, and then melted while entering the Earth's atmosphere'

Eighth: The Edsel was described as 'so hideous that the market rejected it and it's been synonymous with failure ever since'
