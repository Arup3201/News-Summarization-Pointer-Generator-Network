A boat carrying eight sections of the 458-foot antenna that will potentially make One World Trade Center the nation’s tallest building is finally en route to New York from Canada via the Atlantic seaboard.

The Atlantic Salvor barge is expected to arrive in Port Newark next week following a 1,500-mile journey. Once in New Jersey, the spires will be transferred to Manhattan.

Delivery of the antenna had been in jeopardy due to a legal dispute between the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey and Canadian manufacturer ADF Steel that was eventually resolved last month.

Under construction: The trade center's director of construction, Steven Plate, says the spire marks a post 9/11 milestone that signifies New York City is 'better than ever'

In a lawsuit filed at the New York Supreme Court, the Port Authority accused ADF of holding the antenna ‘hostage’ in a bid to receive $6 million it claimed it was owed from another WTC-related project.

There was a race against time to resolve the dispute before the onset of winter that could have delayed delivery of the antenna until next spring at the earliest.

Typically the St. Lawrence river freezes during the winter and if ADF hadn’t shipped the giant antenna parts by December, delivery would probably have been delayed and the March completion date of the tower would have been at risk.

That would have had serious implications for the scheduled opening of One World Trade Center and  would also have resulted in the layoff of 100 iron workers who will construct the antenna from the 18 separate segments.

The barge left Valleyfield, Quebec, last Friday loaded with the eight largest sections which range from five to 67 tons. The remaining 10 smaller sections are being transported via road.

Once these separate elements have been welded together the 458-foot antenna, which has cost $10 million and weighs 750 ton, will be placed on top of the soon to be completed WTC building.

Beacon of hope: One World Trade Center - the lit-up building on the left - is currently New York City's tallest skyscraper

The antenna, designed in collaboration with artist Kenneth Snelson, is part of the tower’s 'crown' and will allow the building to reach a symbolic height of 1,776 feet, a nod to the year the U.S. declared its independence from Great Britain.

The skyscraper is intended to serve as a ‘symbol of recovery’ after the original towers, which collapsed during the 2001 September 11 terrorist attacks.

Once completed, One World Trade Center had been expected to formally become the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, surpassing the Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) in Chicago.

However in May, plans were dropped to enclose the antenna with an ornamental white shell after it was claimed it would be too costly 
and dangerous to maintain.

As the building's spire will no longer be enclosed, it may instead have to be classified as a simple antenna which, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, cannot be included in a building's official height.

Without the inclusion of the antenna 
mast, One World Trade Center's official height would be its roof height 
of 1,318 feet, making it only the third-tallest building in the United 
States, behind the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel & 
Tower, both located in Chicago.

Even without the spire, the 
still-under-construction World Trade Center has already eclipsed the 
Empire State Building’s 1,250 feet to make it the tallest building in 
New York. However even that record might be surpassed by the completion of 432 Park Avenue in 2016, which is expected to rise to a height of 1,379 feet.

The building's developers dispute the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign, with Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman reiterating that 'One World Trade Center will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.'

The CTBUH has announced it will wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire will count towards the building's official height until after One World Trade Center's completion next year.
