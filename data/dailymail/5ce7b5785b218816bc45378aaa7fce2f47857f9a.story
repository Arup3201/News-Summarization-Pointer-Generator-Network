Hull City are poised to bid £3.5million for Tottenham defender Michael Dawson.

Manager Steve Bruce is still trying to get a permanent deal agreed for Jake Livermore whom Tottenham value at £8m and may need to put in a joint offer of around £10m.

Dawson, 30, is top of Bruce's wishlist but he faces competition from Crystal Palace too.
