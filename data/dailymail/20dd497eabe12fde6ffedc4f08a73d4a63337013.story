A mattress ended up looking like a giant slice of pizza after it caught on fire when a couple tried to use a hand warmer to heat up their bed.

The man and woman - who also had their son at home - tried to deal with the blaze after the bedding at the property in Pimlico, central London, caught fire in the early hours of this morning.

The couple attempted to extinguish the blaze themselves at the house, which had no smoke alarm, but firefighters were called at 3.25am - and arrived as the three of them were leaving the block.

Expensive area: Firefighters from Chelsea and Lambeth fire stations attended the blaze on Gloucester Street (above, file picture), a road with an average property value of £1million

Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus led them to safety - before they were all treated for smoke inhalation at the scene by London Ambulance Service crews. The fire was under control by 4.20am.

Hot stuff: File picture of a charcoal hand warmer

Charcoal hand warmers provide heat for users by burning charcoal in a box, and can last up to six hours.

The box has an inside layer of non-flammable material that will evenly spread the heat.

They are started by lighting a charcoal stick before quickly extinguishing it and placing it inside the box. They are often used by skiers and walkers, or workers in cold locations.

Owen Neale, London Fire Brigade fire investigator, said: ‘No smoke alarm, trying to fight the fire themselves and using a charcoal hand warmer next to bedding.

‘So it’s fair to say that the residents were lucky to escape without serious injury. 

'It’s important that people don’t use items like hand warmers to heat their beds as the bedding can catch fire and put those sleeping at risk.

‘It’s also vital that everyone has at least one smoke alarm on every level of their home. 

'Make sure it’s your New Year resolution to check your smoke alarms work.’

All other residents in the block were told it was safer to stay in their flats than walk into the smoke-filled corridor.

Firefighters from Chelsea and Lambeth stations attended the blaze on Gloucester Street, a road with an average property value of £1million.

The LFB has launched a campaign called Know the Plan, designed to improve awareness of fire safety for the residents of high rise buildings and purpose built blocks.

It also aims to encourage landlords and housing providers to act on their fire safety responsibilities.
