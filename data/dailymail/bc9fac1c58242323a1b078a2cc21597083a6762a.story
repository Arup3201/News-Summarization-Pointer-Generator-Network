Arsene Wenger has branded Leonardo Jardim a liar after the Monaco coach accused the Frenchman of a lack of respect following Arsenal's exit from the Champions League.

Jardim, whose side beat the Gunners on away goals in the last 16 of the competition, said Wenger left for the changing rooms early rather than shaking his hands after the Ligue 1 side's impressive 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg.

The Portuguese boss thus decided not to thank the 65-year-old following Arsenal's 2-0 victory in the return fixture.

The Monaco coach claims he did so as Wenger didn't congratulate him after the first-leg victory

Speaking after their progression to the quarter-finals, Jardim said: 'In the first leg, when I wanted to thank Arsene and shake his hand, it's true that Arsene didn't shake my hand, so even though Monaco did everything to make life comfortable for Arsenal tonight, I decided not to thank him.

'I think it was disrespectful. Right now, we're celebrating and we think Arsenal did not show enough respect during the first leg.'

Wenger though insists such claims are lies, and says Jardim was too busy celebrating with his team to notice that the Arsenal boss had waited to congratulate him in north London.

'Pictures show that I waited to congratulate the Monaco coach after the game. He celebrated his victory with his staff, which I quite understand,' he told L'Equipe.

'I congratulated him after the press conference. I am therefore surprised and disappointed to hear such lies.

'That said, I wish Monaco all the best and good luck for the future.'

Monaco will play Juventus in the next round, while Arsenal must now concentrate on the Premier League and the FA Cup.
