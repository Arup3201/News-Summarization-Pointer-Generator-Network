Suzanne Basso held back tears and smiled at her friends as she became the fourteenth woman to be executed in America since the resumption of capital punishment.

The 59-year-old woman was found guilty in 1999 of leading a group of thugs to viciously torture and murder Louis 'Buddy' Musso, a mentally disabled man she convinced to move with her to Texas with the promise of marriage.

Executions of women are uncommon in the U.S. and only five women in Texas have been put to death since the Supreme Court resumed capital punishment in 1976.

Justice for Buddy: Suzanne Basso (left), 59,  was put to death Wednesday night in relation to the 1998 torture slaying of Louis 'Buddy' Musso (right), a 59-year-old mentally impaired man with the intellect of a 7-year-old, near Houston

Texas, which executes the most death 
row convicts out of any state, has stopped giving last meal requests so 
Basso had the same dinner as all the other inmates: baked chicken, fish,
 boiled eggs, carrots, green beans, and sliced bread.

Basso was led into the execution room around 2:15pm, wearing her white prison uniform.

When asked by the warden if she had any last words, Basso said: 'No sir'.

She
 seemed to be holding back tears when she smiled at two friends watching
 through the window. She mouthed a word to them and nodded before being 
injected with the lethal drug pentobarbital.

After the lethal injection. Basso began to snore, though the snoring became less audible and eventually stopped.

She was officially pronounced dead at 6:26pm, 11 minutes after the drug was administered.

Shocking crime: Basso was convicted in 1999 of leading a group of thugs in cutting and bashing Musso before dumping his body in a ditch so they could cash his life insurance policy

Leading
 up to the execution, Basso's lawyer argued that the 59-year-old woman 
was not mentally competent enough to face the death penalty because she 
suffers from delusions, and that the state statute governing competency 
was unconstitutionally flawed. He also challenged the legality of a 
medical examiner's testimony.

A state judge last month ruled that Basso had a history of fabricating stories about herself, sought attention and manipulated psychological tests.

‘She would pretend to be different things,’ recalled Colleen Barnett, who prosecuted Basso. ‘One setting she would pretend to be blind. One setting she would pretend she couldn't walk. One setting she had the voice of a little girl.

Honey trap: Police say Basso met Musso during a church carnival in New Jersey and lured him to Texas after promising to marry him

One mental health expert indicated additional testing over an extended period of time ‘would provide a more reliable evaluation,’ attorney Winston Cochran said in a federal court filing.

‘Why rush to judgment on Basso?’ he asked, seeking a punishment delay that was refused Monday by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and a federal judge.

He took his appeals Tuesday to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one step short of the Supreme Court.

At the competency hearing, a haggard-looking Basso sporting a cropped haircut testified from a hospital bed wheeled into a Houston courtroom and talked about a snake smuggled into a prison hospital in an attempt to kill her.

Cochran said a degenerative disease 
has left her paralyzed. Basso, 59, contended her paralysis was the 
result of a jail beating years ago.

At
 the hearing, she acknowledged representations about her background — 
that she was a triplet, worked in the New York governor's office, had a 
relationship with Nelson Rockefeller — were untrue. She originally was 
from the Albany and Schenectady areas of New York.

At her trial, Basso was portrayed as the ringleader of a group of people who fatally tortured Musso in 1998 to steal his money.

Musso,
 who had the intellect of a 7-year-old child but cared for himself, had 
met either Basso or her son at a church carnival in New Jersey. He left 
there to move in with her in Jacinto City, just east of Houston.

‘She lured him to Texas with the idea they'd get married,’ Barnett said.

Evidence
 showed that she already was married, made herself the beneficiary of 
insurance policies purchased for Musso and took over his Social Security
 benefits.

Five others, 
including Basso's son, also were convicted for Musso's death but 
prosecutors sought the death penalty only for Basso.

Web of lies: Basso had pretended to be blind or paralyzed, said she was a triplet, worked in the New York governor's office, and had a relationship with Nelson Rockefeller

Court documents detailed extensive abuse Musso endured days before his body was found in a ditch by a jogger.

He'd
 been bathed in a solution of bleach and pine cleaner and scrubbed with a
 wire brush. An autopsy showed he had at least 17 cuts to his head; 28 
cuts and cigarette burns on his back; bruises all over his body; a skull
 fracture; a fractured bone in his neck; 14 broken ribs and two 
dislocated vertebrae.

‘It 
was just horrible, horrible, horrible,’ Barnett said. ‘When you talk 
about the death penalty, what the death penalty was made for, it was for
 a case like this.’

Basso told police in a written statement that she drove Musso's body to the dump site.

She became a suspect after reporting Musso missing in an apparent attempt to distance herself from his slaying once his body was discovered.

None of the eight other women on Texas death row has an execution date.
