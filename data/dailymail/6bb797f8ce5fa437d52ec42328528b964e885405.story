A man who allegedly tied weights to his dog's hind legs, beat him and dragged him through the streets has been charged with animal cruelty.

Fabian Santiago, 20, was arrested Thursday in Manassas, Virginia, after a photo of him walking the animal caught the attention of police.

A concerned bystander who saw Santiago out with the animal last month, posted a photograph, which was shared repeatedly on social media, and eventually came to the attention of authorities.

Speaking to local Fox station WTTG, a Manassas City Police spokesman said the woman who posted the photo also called them.

The spokesman said: 'The witness told us that she had seen the owner striking the dog with his hand while walking him, he had also ties weights to the dog's legs.

'The dog was on a leash so he was essentially pulling the dog.'

Manassas City Police said Santiago explained what he was doing - but would not reveal what his reason was.

However, a police spokesman said the practice is typical in animals being trained for dog-fighting.

The dog, who was not badly hurt, is being cared for by Santiago's family while he awaits his court date next month.
