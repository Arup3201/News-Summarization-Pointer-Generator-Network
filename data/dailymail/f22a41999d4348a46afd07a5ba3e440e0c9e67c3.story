A mother who was told she was too fat to conceive naturally has spoken of her joy after she lost five stone - and gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

Kerry McKenna, 33, endured two years of heartache after unsuccessfully trying for a child with husband Mike, 34, since 2011.

Doctors warned Kerry, from Derbyshire, she was too overweight to give birth naturally as she tipped the scales at 16 stone 11lb and wore size 20 clothes.

But determined Kerry decided to lose weight and shed five stone by eating more healthily - and was delighted when she fell pregnant in April last year.

On February 2, Kerry gave birth to their first child, Abigail, who weighed 7lbs 10oz, at Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre.

And, since giving birth, the new mum has already lost most of her baby weight and is a healthy 11 stone 11lb and a size 10.

Kerry, who lives in Long Eaton with football commentator husband Mike, said she ditched frozen pizzas and pies to lose weight, adding: 'I really wanted to start a family.

'We’d tried for a year and nothing was happening so the doctor said "the first thing you need to do is try and lose some weight".

'You don’t want to be a big person so there’s always something in your mind saying you really should lose weight.

'But when the doctor said my chances of pregnancy were increased if I lost weight, that gave me the motivation to stop putting it off.

'There wasn’t even any inkling of the possibility of falling pregnant until I’d lost the weight.

'Abigail is perfect. I feel really blessed that we have her, our dream to have a family has come true.'

Kerry blamed her bulging figure on eating convenience food all day while working for Boots on their website at the company’s headquarters in Beeston, Nottinghamshire.

Having joined Slimming World and slimmed to a size 10 (L) Kerry and Mike were delighted to find out she was pregnant with their first child (R) after trying to conceive for years

But the pounds soon fell off after she joined Slimming World - and it also educated Kerry to get the right nutrients on board once she was pregnant.

The IT worker added: 'It was frozen pizzas or pies or just the stuff you could throw in the oven at the end of the day.

'Lunch was a sandwich and crisps. I had Diet Coke, thinking that made it a bit healthy, but I was just kidding myself.

'I was a bit lazy in what I was eating. It was always about something quick and convenient.

'Joining Slimming World opened my eyes to being able to eat proper food.

Breakfast: Sugary cereals like Frosties

Mid-morning: Chocolate bar or crisps

Lunch: Shop-bought sandwich, like Ploughman’s or cheese, and crisps

Afternoon: Biscuits

Dinner: Frozen pizza and chips

Evening: Biscuits

Breakfast: Weetabix

Mid-morning: Yoghurt

Lunch: Pasta with salad

Afternoon: Fruit

Dinner: Homemade chilli with rice and roasted vegetables

Evening: Nothing

'I thought it was going to be a diet but I realised quite quickly it’s about eating proper, balanced food.

'It was more about focusing on making sure I was eating the right foods and you get an extra allowance of calcium and fibre to make sure you’re giving the baby everything it needs.

'Fruit gave me terrible indigestion so trying to get the healthy balance in was a little tricky at times but I relied on vegetables instead of fruit to make sure I got all the vitamins.

'The wonderful thing was I looked pregnant.

'I was scared that I was going to end up looking like a fat woman again and people wouldn’t realise I was pregnant but it all went on the front and for once I felt like I actually looked good.'

Members of Kerry’s Slimming World class in Chilwell, Nottinghamshire, have since met baby Abigail.

Group leader Kerry Ward said: 'To see Kerry lose the weight and have Abigail is lovely. She’s the most beautiful baby.

'Kerry has done amazingly well and has been so dedicated. She only missed two weigh-ins before the birth and one the week afterwards.

'We don’t encourage pregnant women to lose weight but to eat healthily and keep active.'
