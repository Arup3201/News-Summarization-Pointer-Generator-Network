Two pensioners have at last walked down the aisle as a married couple, having been engaged for 40 years.

Former electrician Keith Travis, 65, says it was love at first sight when he was called out to the home of Brenda Moran, 71, as a handyman to fix a leaking pipe in 1970.

But despite proposing to his sweetheart four years later - and being accepted - the happy couple, who live in Mossley, Greater Manchester, never got round to setting a date.

Keith said: 'I've asked her on numerous occasions, probably three or four times a year over the past 43 years. I think she was just playing hard to get!'

Although Keith never lost hope, it was Brenda - who has three daughters from a previous marriage, and is a grandmother of four - who surprised him in 2012 with a leap-year proposal in front of all their friends at The Backstep Boogie dance club.

Dressed in their 1940s finery, they eventually married just before Christmas at The Monastery in Gorton.

They danced up and down the aisle to their favourite songs, signing the register to Why Do Fools Fall in Love.

Former probation service worker Brenda, said: 'I did always say if I got married again it would have to be somewhere special and it was.

'We are swing jivers and we do rock and roll but we do prefer the 40s. We arrived in a big Bramworth car all dressed up and all the guests were dressed up too.

'I got changed at night time into a rock and roll outfit with fairy lights underneath.

'It was wonderful. Keith is a changed man, it meant the world to him to be married.'

Keith, who works at Park Cake Bakeries in Oldham, added: 'The day certainly didn't disappoint, it was fantastic. It's something I have looked forward to for 40-odd years.

'We have always been together, we have weathered any storms together, and it doesn't really feel any different at all. I suppose I do feel happier, I can't really understand why.'
