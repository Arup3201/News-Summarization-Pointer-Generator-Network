To a tea: New research claims the optimum length of time to leave tea to stew is just 25 seconds

It's a debate that’s been brewing almost as long as there’s been tea: just how long should you leave the bag to stew?

Now at last one expert has what he says is the definitive answer – and it is a result that goes against everything the manufacturers say.

The optimum length of time to leave in the bag, according to professional food and drink taster Martin Isark, is exactly 25 seconds.

‘Any less, and there’s not enough flavour, any longer, and there’s too much tannin, giving your tea a horrible stewed taste,’ said Mr Isark, who tested bags from Tetley, Typhoo, PG Tips, Twinings and Yorkshire – which together account for 81 per cent of the British tea market.

Running his trial with strict controls, the 59-year-old tested the bags in the same teacup throughout, using freshly boiled bottled water and stirring each cup just once.

His findings contradict the advice on the boxes, which ranges from PG Tips’ suggested 40 seconds to four to five minutes for Yorkshire Tea.

Mr Isark drank 400 cups in 48 hours to draw his conclusion and believes the demands of impatient consumers are behind the brewing speed. 

He said: ‘Cheaper, smaller tea leaf particles are used because they release flavour quickly.

'Bags have to be filled with tiny particles of broken leaves that have lost the wonderful flavour nuances associated with full-leaf Assams, Darjeelings and Oolong teas.’

The connoisseur, who prefers first-flush Darjeeling at £700 for 100g, claims Yorkshire Tea offered the best taste. ‘With Yorkshire Tea, you can get away with a 30-second brew time but no more,’ he said.

As to why manufacturers recommend lengthy brewing times, Mr Isark, who runs the website CanIEatIt, said: ‘Perhaps they’re trying to suggest that they sell a better product than they really are. Three to five minutes is only appropriate for the very best teas.’

The results have divided industry opinion. Tea master Edward Eisler, of maker Jing Tea, agreed. He said: ‘Teabags with tiny tea particles will deliver a very quick infusion in around 25 seconds, but the downside is that they compromise on clear regional and varietal flavour.’

But Philip Magor, chairman of UK-based tea farm owner Williamson Tea, which supplies the main five brands except Tetley, dismissed the claims. He said: ‘I’m not convinced by the research – 25 seconds is nowhere near enough time to release those important antioxidants.’

Tea brewing time has long been a hot topic, and in 2011 a team of academics devised a mathematical formula claiming to prove the perfect cuppa is best drunk exactly six minutes after being made. 

The optimum brew time, they found, was two minutes. And last week, the Advertising Standards Authority backed claims by PG Tips that their pyramid-shaped bags released more flavour than Tetley’s round bags.

A Typhoo spokesman said: ‘We would recommend that the tea is brewed for two to three minutes to get the maximum flavour and depth of colour from the tea.’

A spokesman for Yorkshire Tea said: ‘We recommend brewing for four to five minutes in order to get a proper brew with a rich, full flavour.’

Tetley said customers should brew in whichever way gives them their perfect cup. A spokesman added: ‘We say two to three minutes more as a guideline which will let the flavour of the tea infuse.’

A Twinings spokesman said: ‘We generally suggest a brew time of three-and-a-half minutes.’

And a spokesman for PG Tips added: ‘While we recommend an optimum brewing time (40 seconds), it should always come down to personal preference.’

Said if left longer there is stewed taste, but any quicker and it has no flavour
