Formula One star Michael Schumacher has been dumped by wealthy sponsors since the ski accident which left him 'paralysed'

Formula One star Michael Schumacher has been dumped by wealthy sponsors since the ski accident which left him 'paralysed' and close to death.

The seven-time champion is expected to lose out on more than £4million a year as a result of the decisions by companies who no longer see him as a role model for their products.

Fashion firms Navyboot and Jet Set have reportedly severed all commercial ties with the recovering coma victim as doubts remain over the chances of a full recovery.

Schumacher, 45, suffered severe head injuries while skiing with his family in the French Alps in December last year.

He is currently recovering, but is said to be 'paralysed, wheelchair-bound and unable to speak', according to former racing driver Philippe Streiff.

A spokeswoman for Phillipe Gaydoul, who owns the fashion firms, confirmed the decision to the end the lucrative contract, which paid Schumacher £4million a year.

'It is not easy for Schumacher's sponsors: paying out millions of Swiss francs per year and receiving nothing back since the crash,' said Swiss news website Bluewin

'But must they separate in this situation from the Formula 1 legend? It is a balancing act: On the one hand, the sponsors must pursue economic objectives, which point towards for a parting. On the other hand it will not be well received in public if you are turning your back on Schumacher at this difficult time.'

Earlier this year the German mineral water company Rosbacher reportedly annulled its contract with him.  

It is not yet clear which other companies have severed their links with Schumacher, who is being cared for by a team of specialists at his £35million mansion on the shores of Lake Geneva.

Mercedes and wealth management firm DVAG have promised to stand by the stricken star.  

He was transferred to his mansion at the end of the summer from a rehab clinic in Lausanne where doctors decided it would be better for him to be with his family.

Last month Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said the driver faced a 'difficult' and 'long' rehabilitation.

She said it was 'not possible' to say how long it would take for him to fully recover.

Schumacher, who has amassed a £500million fortune, is being cared for in a state-of-the-art medical suite built inside his mansion.

The Formula One driver, who is a very competent skier, was on holiday with family and friends in French Alps ski-resort Meribel when the accident happened.

He went off-piste while skiing with his 14-year-old son and struck a partially-covered rock.

He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock and smashed his head on a bolder. 

Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specialises in head injuries.

He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain.

At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma.

On April 4 Kehm revealed that he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'.

He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment. It was the first piece of positive news for months.
