A customer who order a healthy lunchtime snack got more greens than she bargained for after discovering a severed lizard's head in her salad.

Robin Sandusky, 31, ordered a kale salad from a Guy & Gallard store in Chelsea, Manhattan, but was half-way through eating the order when she spotted the reptile.

When she touched the object almost camouflaged among the salad leaves with her fork she realised it was the head of a lizard.

'It was the craziest thing,' Ms Sandusky told the New York Post.

'After a few bites, I look down at my fork, and think, oh, ‘Is that a piece of asparagus?

’And then I saw that it had eyes, and an arm.'

Ms Sandusky, who works as a theatrical
 coorindator, called the store and asked for a refund on the $4.25 
salad, declining store's offer for a replacement.

A delivery worker picked up the salad and refunded Ms Sandusky, the store manager at the Seventh Avenue location confirmed to NBC New York.

The manager said he apologized but could not confirm that a dead animal part was in the food.

'She told me, but I didn't check it,' he said. 'When the salad came back, I wasn't here.'

Jason Jeffries, a managing partner at Guy and Gallard, said the company will investigate Sandusky's allegation.

But the review site highlights another disgruntled customer who wrote: 'I bought a tuna sandwich at one of location, 240 W. 40th St and I found an inch long METAL piece inside of it. I was chewing it and had to spit it out.'

Last December a a Wall Street Journal employee found a dead frog in her salad.

She had visited the Pret a Manger on Sixth Avenue/47 Street in Manhattan to get what she assumed would be a regular Albacore Tuna Nicoise Salad.

But in addition to the tomatoes, tuna, egg and olives, there was an extra ingredient: a small amphibian.
