Steven Gerrard was diplomacy personified after his final Premier League derby, even saying he would miss playing at Goodison Park.

On the evidence of last night's game, it shouldn't take him more than a couple of weeks of California sunshine to get over any pangs of nostalgia.

Just over a year ago, Liverpool and Everton were both in the top-five when they clashed at Goodison and produced a thrilling 3-3 draw that was a candidate for match of the season.

Since then, both clubs have gone a little off the boil, or a lot off the boil in Everton's case, and this game reflected that.

There was plenty of running, desire and defensive organisation but little in the way of thrills and creativity.

The exceptions were Gerrard who twice came close to scoring a fairytale winner and, at the other end of the age scale, 19-year-old winger Jordon Ibe who struck the post in the first half.

As for Everton, for a home side to wait until the 86th minute to register a shot on target in a derby is almost unthinkable. No wonder Roberto Martinez, whose glass is always half full, preferred to concentrate on a clean sheet that made it six games unbeaten, though they remain stuck in mid-table for the time being.

Rodgers was upbeat afterwards after his gamble on giving Ibe only his second start in a red shirt paid off.

The youngster came closest to breaking the deadlock when he ran past two Everton defenders before planting a 25-yard shot against the upright. 'I thought it would creep in,' he admitted shyly after collecting his man-of-the-match award.

Rodgers was more effusive. 'I thought over the course of the game we were clearly the better team, he said.

'The balance was very good. We pressed, we looked exiting and were a threat going forward. We switched off in the last five minutes and they had a counter attack but that was their first shot on target.

'I had been waiting to bring Jordon into the team. We felt he could contribute, it is why we brought him back from loan at Derby and I had no qualms about putting him in for this game.'

So often has Gerrard written his own scripts – not least against Everton with 10 goals in 32 previous derbies – it was almost a surprise when his first-half free-kick was clawed away by Joel Robles, and when an acrobatic overhead kick cannoned off the head of Steven Naismith and went wide. 

Typically, he preferred to concentrate on Ibe afterwards rather than wallow in his own farewell. 'It was a sensational performance, he only knew on Friday he'd be playing,' said Gerrard. 'He was man of the match.'

Merseyside Police weren't happy with the 5.30pm kick off time but it meant the floodlights were on at the start and added to a crackling atmosphere.

The first contentious decision, a Naismith barge on Mamadou Sakho, was met with a cacophony of howls and we seemed all set for rip-roaring contest.

Unfortunately, it became clear fairly quickly that neither team feel confident enough at the moment to take their foot off the pedal and go for it.

Everton were happy to see their midfield “dog of war” James McCarthy back after six weeks absence and built their team around him. Liverpool looked a more cohesive unit with Sterling and Coutinho pinging first-time passes around but the Gerrard free-kick apart, they had little to show for it in front of goal.

As a manager, Martinez loved it and he and Rodgers were constantly issuing instructions to their players. 'Tactically it was fascinating, with two asymetric shapes,' said the Everton boss.

Unfortunately for everyone else, there wasn't enough going on in the penalty areas to make it exciting.

Liverpool kept Romelu Lukaku quiet with defender Emre Can described as a “Rolls Royce” by Rodgers. When Daniel Sturridge came on for Liverpool after 55 minutes, he didn't get a real sniff of goal.

There wasn't even much genuine aggro flying about. Jordan Henderson and Naismith were booked for dishing out verbals to each other late on and Kevin Mirallas stormed away after being substituted but it was handbags stuff.

Perhaps there weren't enough Scousers on the pitch who knew how much the fixture meant; just Gerrard until Rickie Lambert and Ross Barkley came on as late substitutes. Everton's local left-back Leighton Baines has an injured knee.

Gerrard tried a scissors kick that was goalbound til it hit Naismith and then at the end, Everton belatedly had a late flurry. Barkley played in Coleman and his rising shot produced a flying save by Mignolet.

A point for Liverpool keeps them four points off a Champions League spot. Everton's only chance of qualifying for Europe rests with winning the Europa League, a competition where they could meet their Merseyside rivals again.

Meanwhile, Gerrard's farewell tour continues before he hits Los Angeles Galaxy. With each passing week, he must feel he's made the right decision.
