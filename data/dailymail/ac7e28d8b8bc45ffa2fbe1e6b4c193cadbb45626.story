America's painkiller epidemic has been laid bare in its most stark terms to date as a UN report reveals that U.S. citizens abuse more pills than any other country in the world.

The United Nation's World Drug Report 2014 shows that 6.1 per cent of American adults, aged between 15 and 64, abused prescribed pain opioids, such as codeine and oxycontin, in 2012.

Shockingly, that figure is twice as high as the world's second-worst offender, Australia, where opioid addicts comprise 3.1 per cent of citizens.

Epidemic rising: The United Nation's World Drug Report 2014 shows that 6.1 per cent of American adults abused prescribed pain opioids, such as codeine and morphine, in 2012

'In the United States, past-year illicit drug use by persons aged 12 years or older reached the highest level in the past 10 years,' the report said, adding: 'The number of deaths resulting from prescriptionpainkiller overdose also continues to rise, especially among women.'

It goes on to state that 'medical emergencies related to the non-medical use of pharmaceuticals' skyrocketed by 132 per cent between 2004 and 2011, while with the number of trips to the ER for overdoses of 'opiates and/or opioids' leapt 183 per cent in the same time frame.

According to official figures, more than 250 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written for Americans in 2010.

Danger: The danger of opioids - such as oxycontin - lies primarily in the fact that they are so highly addictive, say experts

OxyContin, the most infamous of prescription opioids and the main protagonist in the painkiller epidemic, did not come in a tamper-resistant formulation until 2010.

By then, it had been implicated in thousands of overdose deaths since it hit the market in 1996 as its earlier formulation allowed users to crush it into a powder to snort or inject.

The danger of opioids - which also include Tylenol with Codeine, Empirin with Codeine, Roxanol, Duramorph, Demerol, Percocet, Tylox and Dilaudid - lies primarily in the fact that they are so highly 
addictive, say experts.

1. U.S.A. - 6.10%

2. Australia - 3.40%

3. Afghanistan - 2.92%

4. Pakistan - 2.40%

5. Seychelles - 2.30%

6. Russia - 2.29%

7. Iran - 2.27%

8. United Kingdom - 1.71%

9. Estonia - 1.53%

10. Azerbaijan - 1.50%

The Johns 
Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness said last year that, by
 2008, 'the annual number of fatal drug poisonings 
surpassed those of motor vehicle deaths and overdose deaths attributable
 to prescription drugs exceeded those of cocaine and heroin combined.'

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime - who published the report - describe the effect such prescription drugs have on the human body.

It's 
authors write: 'At the heart of opioid addiction is the powerful 
rewarding effect [that triggers] a cascade of intense pleasurable 
responses related to the brain dopamine release.

'Users describe an initial rush followed by feelings of warmth, pleasure and sedation.

'Once
 regular use is established, vulnerable individuals develop an 
uncontrollable compulsive behaviour that is the main characteristic of 
opioid dependence, seeking to obtain the substance in spite of any 
negative consequence.'

It
 comes a month after it was revealed that most people who abuse 
addictive prescription painkillers get them for free from friends or 
relatives, while drug dealers are a relatively uncommon source for those
 at highest risk for deadly overdoses.

A
 government study found that people who abuse most frequently, often 'doctor-shop'; more than 1 in 4 who used these drugs almost daily said 
they had been prescribed by one or more physicians.

Almost
 as many said they got them for free from friends or relatives; only 15 
percent of the most frequent abusers said they bought the drugs from 
dealers or other strangers.

Those
 abusers 'are probably using at much greater volumes and simply asking a
 friend for a pill now and then is not going to be sufficient,' said Dr.
 Leonard Paulozzi, a researcher at the federal Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention.
