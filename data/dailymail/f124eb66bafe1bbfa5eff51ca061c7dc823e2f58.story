Cyclists should not be fined for mounting the pavement to avoid dangerous stretches of road, a transport minister told police.

Minister for cycling Robert Goodwill urged police to remember guidance which states that fixed penalty notices are ‘not aimed at responsible cyclists’.

Official guidelines from 1999 state that the fines should not be aimed at those using pavements out of ‘fear of traffic’, provided they show consideration for pedestrians.

It also states that discretion is needed because ‘children and young people’ are often scared to cycle on roads.

Mr Goodwill’s warning came after complaints from cycling campaigners that £50 fines were being made over-zealously by police.

Donnachadh McCarthy, of Stop Killing Cyclists, said some officers had told him they had been advised to ignore guidance and issue fines ever time cyclists were spotted on the pavement.

In a letter to Mr McCarthy, the minister said: ‘Thank you for bringing the issue of cycling on the pavement around dangerous junctions such as Vauxhall Cross to my attention.

'I agree that the police should be using discretion in enforcing this law and would support Paul Boateng’s original guidance.’

Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, the national policing spokesman for cycling, said: ‘The ministerial guidance supports the importance of police discretion in taking a reasonable and proportionate approach with safety being a guiding principle.’
