London Irish director of rugby Brian Smith will leave the club at the end of the season, after deciding to return home to Australia with his family.

The former England attack coach, who was part of Martin Johnson's management team at the last World Cup, is in his second stint in charge of the Exiles.

Sportsmail understands that Smith informed his employers before Christmas that he would be moving Down Under in the summer, to end an association with Irish stretching back to 2005.

There has been speculation linking ex-Ireland coach Declan Kidney to the job, but it is thought that the Exiles' difficult financial position will guard against such a high-profile appointment.

Meanwhile, Smith has been mentioned in connection with a coaching role at the Brisbane-based Queensland Reds, but with Michael Cheika recently taking charge of the Wallabies, there is also the possibility of an opening with Super 15 champions the Waratahs in Sydney.

Irish have been in the lower reaches of the Aviva Premiership table this season, but in his previous spell with the Exiles, Smith guided the team to the Heineken Cup semi-finals and third place in the league.
