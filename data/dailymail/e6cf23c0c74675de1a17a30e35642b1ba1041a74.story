A Libyan man had a shock when he returned to his car after seeking shelter from shelling.

A live mortar shell had become wedged in the bodywork of the vehicle as it stood parked in the city of Benghazi.

Fawwaz Qasim Kassis risked his life to take the snap of the grenade, which struck the car on the hatch to the petrol tank.

Dangerously close: A live mortar shell that struck a car in Benghazi, Libya, became wedged in the bodywork instead of exploding

But instead of exploding, the live mortar shell punched a hole in the bodywork and stopped when it hit the rubber tire.

He said: 'I ran off when I saw it and shouted to everyone to keep away, but after half a day when it was still there and hadn't exploded, I went back and took a snap.'

But the un-exploded mortar is reportedly still wedged in car because for the moment it's too dangerous to remove, according to Mr Kassis who posted these images online.

This weekend, deadly fighting between Islamist militias and forces backed by Libya's internationally recognised government forced the closure of an airport in eastern Tripoli, military sources said.

At least four people were killed and ten wounded in clashes between the Islamist Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn) and fighters loyal to the government around the Mitiga air base, the sources said.

An airport official said that Mitiga was closed to air traffic due to the violence.

Libyan carriers moved civilian flights to Mitiga after Tripoli's main international airport was damaged by fierce fighting between state-backed fighters and Islamist militias in July.

More than three years after dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed in a NATO-backed revolt, Libya is awash with weapons and powerful militias, and run by rival governments and parliaments.
