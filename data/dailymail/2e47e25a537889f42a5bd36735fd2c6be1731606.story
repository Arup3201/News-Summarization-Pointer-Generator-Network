A baby girl who was born after just 25 weeks of pregnancy weighing only 1lb 11oz is set to make it home to her family in time for Christmas.

Skylar Primrose Knight has spent the last eight months in hospital fighting for her life.

Now, she is to be allowed to go home to celebrate her first Christmas with her parents, Caroline and Richard, and siblings Som, 10, and Summer, five.

Skylar Primrose Knight (pictured with her parents, Richard and Caroline) was born at just 25 weeks and only weighed 1lb 11oz. She was given just a 30 per cent chance of survival

Mrs Knight, 37, of South Walsham, Norfolk, said: ’When she’s well she is a really happy and content little baby.

‘When you see her smile, it just melts you.’

She added: ‘It will be lovely to have her back home for Christmas.’

Skylar arrived in April, tipping the scales at less than the weight of a bag of sugar.

Ever since her birth, she has been battling to survive at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit.

The family had been expecting to welcome their third baby into the world on July 26.

But halfway through Mrs Knight’s pregnancy, her waters broke.

She went to the doctor and within days it was clear the baby was on the way.

She was forced to spend five days at Luton and Dunstable Hospital in Bedfordshire before a bed was found at Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.

Skylar was born on April 13 and her long battle for survival began.

Offshore oil worker Mr Knight, 38, said: ‘We were told there was a 30 per cent chance of survival and of that 30 per cent there was only a 10 per cent chance she would not have brain damage.’

Mrs Knight added: ‘They said babies born earlier than 24 weeks were classed as a miscarriage so the longer I kept her in the better chance she had.’

Within minutes of being born, Skylar was put on a ventilator to help her breathe.

She had wires ‘coming out of every vein and artery’ and had to be fed with a special high-energy sugar solution.

Skylar has chronic lung disease but is not believed to have suffered brain damage as was initially feared

Mrs Knight, whose other two children were born full-term, was almost reluctant to meet her baby at first.

‘I think it was a bit of self-preservation - in case we lost her,’ said Mr Knight.

‘I just couldn’t believe it was happening,’ said Mrs Knight.

The day after Skylar was born, Mr Knight went home to explain what was happening to Som and Summer.

‘I told them she was so excited to come home she’d arrived early, but she wasn’t big enough yet so the hospital had put her in a plastic mum to help her grow.

‘When they came to see her, the first thing Summer said was that she looked like a chicken,’ he said.

‘For me, that was amazing. She saw past all the tubes and machines, the wires and scary things.

‘They were both just so happy to have a sister.’

Three weeks ago Skylar nearly died when some food became stuck in her throat and she stopped breathing

Slowly, Skylar - whose name means eternal life, love, strength and beauty - continued to grow and develop.

She has needed five blood transfusions and has battled viruses and infections.

Only three weeks ago, she had to be revived and hauled back from the brink after food stuck in her throat and she stopped breathing.

She’s also battling chronic lung disease but appears to have escaped any brain damage.

‘It is just one thing after another,’ said Mr Knight.

If a baby is born before the 24th week of pregnancy it is classed as a miscarriage.

If it is born between the 24th and 37th weeks of pregnancy it is classed as premature.

Between 37 and 42 weeks it is classed as full-term.

About one in 13 babies are born prematurely in the UK.

‘There have been some really tough decisions, some very tough days.

‘We just had to trust the doctors because they do this every day.’

In July, Skylar was booked to have a heart operation at London’s famous Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Surgeons wanted to clamp shut a valve in her heart which had failed to close after her birth - a condition known as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).

Mr and Mrs Knight were ‘frustrated’ when a three-day wait became three weeks.

But just 24 hours before the surgery, a scan showed the valve was closing by itself and the operation was no longer needed.

Skylar became strong enough to move to the hospital’s children’s ward and this week spent her first night at home.

She is now poised to be freed from hospital on Monday - just in time for Christmas Day.

Mr Knight’s thrilled mother, Dorothy, said: ‘We would like to sincerely thanks all the staff at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, the neonatal intensive care unit and the children’s ward for their nursing skills and dedication in caring for Skylar Primrose.

‘It has been a really long struggle for Skylar but she is certainly a little fighter.’
