A man has been arrested after his neighbor used a cellphone to record footage of him beating a litter of ten puppies.

Jesse Johnson, 28, of north Houston claims he was merely ‘spanking’ the animals in order to teach them some discipline, but the video footage showed him cruelly beating the young puppies with a wooden stick.

Johnson's neighbors Kristina Hernandez and Amanda Assali were alerted to what was going on by the cries and howls of the scared young puppies.

They peeked out a side in their apartment and saw the man pulling out puppies from under his house and beating them.

Quick-thinking Assali decided to poke her cell phone through the blinds covering the window and recorded the gruesome violence.

‘The man just ran after them, went and grabbed them, threw them to the ground, beat them, and beat them, and then threw them to the side,’ Hernandez told KHOU.

The girls then called the police, who arrested Johnson.

He faces a felony charge of cruelty to animals. His bail was set at $2,000.

The mother and ten puppies are now at BARC, Houston's animal shelter. They have been checked over by a vet and will eventually be made available for adoption.
