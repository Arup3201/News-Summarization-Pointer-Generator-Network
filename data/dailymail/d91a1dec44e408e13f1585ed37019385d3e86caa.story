Uruguay boss Oscar Tabarez says Luis Suarez is coping well after surgery, but accepts that the striker may not be able to reproduce his stunning Premier League form.

The Liverpool front man has been struggling with a knee injury prior to the World Cup, but after a shock defeat to Costa Rica is expected to be rushed back to play the Three Lions.

Tabarez refused to confirm whether he will start, and has pleaded with fans to be patient with his star man should he feature.

Tabarez also refused to confirm his team for the Group D clash, with Diego Lugano the only definite absentee.

'If [Suarez] plays we must consider the possibility that he’s not as well as he was during the PL,' Tabarez said. 'But even when not 100% he is someone who can give a lot to his team.

'We thought if everything went well there was no reason for him not to play in the World Cup. He has recovered well.

'Luis has always wanted to face all challenges in his career, not only playing for national team but in other situations. Any time we have need him in any sort of match he has been willing.

'He has always improved himself and his career is wonderful, brilliant. He is a very important player for us because of his tech abilities and his personality.

'We will announce who will play tomorrow and not before. I never tell anyone what I speak about with my players.'

Suarez's potential striking partner Edinson Cavani also spoke at the press conference, acknowledging his friend's attributes, as well as England's.

'We have achieved wonderful things together as we have with Diego Forlan as well,' he said.

'We will do our best. In the first match with had Diego and if Luis plays he will give his best. Whether he feels well or not we will see.

'I can say the Englnad team is very good attacking, very good up front with wonderful players, four players always up front, very fast, more than able to score and they were very direct and pragmatic. They are able to organise wonderful plays very fast.

'They played well but it doesn’t mean they will play the same against Uruguay. We don’t know if Uruguay will be better than Italy. We know we have to fight hard but if we win we will be really strong and very well prepared for the next game.
