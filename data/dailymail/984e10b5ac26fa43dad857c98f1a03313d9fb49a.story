Barack Obama welcomed a future king at the Oval Office today. 

Prince William made a whirlwind solo visit to Washington, D.C., today to meet the president and deliver a speech at the World Bank on stopping illegal wildlife trafficking. 

The Duke of Cambridge then flew back to New York City this afternoon on a 2pm shuttle - in time to meet former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea in the Big Apple. 

During a brief public chat between Obama and Prince William at the White House, the royal revealed that he was so excited after the birth of Prince George that he forgot to ask whether he was a boy or a girl. 

'I remember when George was born, I forgot to work out whether it was a boy or a girl. The excitement of the event and everything else was just chaos. You are suddenly... well actually it's a boy,' he joked. 

Landmark: Prince William, who is second in like to the British throne, was invited to the White House by President Barack Obama

Whirlwind trip: The Duke of Cambridge,  32, will also deliver a speech to the World Bank about stopping illegal wildlife traffic, one of his pet causes

The prince, who also met with Vice President Joe Biden, discussed the 'special relationship' between Great Britain and and the United States. Biden discussed the ongoing efforts to combat ISIS. 

A Kensington Palace spokesman revealed that Prince William gave the Commander in Chief of the United States a signed portrait of himself and Kate - which is said to be the customary gift for such occasions. 

His audience with Obama at the White House is groundbreaking. Price William is second in line to the British throne - after his father Prince Charles - and it's entirely possible he won't become head of state for several decades. 

Prince William left his pregnant wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, in New York City - where the couple arrived Sunday night to a rock star welcome.

Kate visited a center for disadvantaged children in Harlem in Manhattan with New York City's First Lady, Chirlane McCray.

The Duchess of Cambridge didn't accompany her husband to the White House because the visit was not confirmed until after she had agreed to go to Harlem with Ms McCray, Kensington Palace said.  

Obama and the prince have  met before - but never on the president's home turf. The last time the two met was at the 70th anniversary commemoration of D-Day in Normandy. 

The Duke of Cambridge flew first class on a shuttle flight this morning into Washington's Reagan National Airport. He will return to New York this evening to watch the Brooklyn Nets take on LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.   

Taking a stand: At the World Bank, Prince Williams said, 'In my view, one of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in the world today is the illegal wildlife trade'

The Duke of Cambridge praised China's efforts to crack down on traffic in shark fins - while also mentioning that a large demand for illegal ivory comes from the nation

Prince William was greeted by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim before his speech, in which he called on nations to do more to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade

The prince later met with conservation officials from around the world at a luncheon following his speech

Better safe than sorry: Police broke into a suspicious SUV outside the World Bank shortly before Prince William arrived - but determined it was safe

Prince William and Obama’s conversation could barely be heard above the clicking of cameras and reporters shouting questions, but the two could be seen laughing and smiling as the chatted. 

He commented that next year will be very busy. 

'It's going to be interesting next year. A busy year next year,' he remarked. 

Prince William and Kate's second child is due in April. The couple also have officials visits planned to Japan and China.  

Noting the large group of reporters crammed into the room, a surprised William remarked that 'you can’t get any more people in the room.’

The president thanked reporters for coming and for their interest in William's ‘very important work.’

The only question he took from press was about his health, following recent reports of a sore throat that tests proved to be the result of acid reflux. 

‘I’m fine. I was completely fine,’ he assured.

Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill also greeted the prince in Washington, though that meeting was closed to the press. 

The White House said: 'The President and Duke of Cambridge discussed the long and special relationship between the UK and the United States. In addition, the Duke of Cambridge briefed the president on his initiative to combat the illegal wildlife trade, an issue to which the president and this administration are strongly committed.

'Vice President and Dr. Biden discussed our bilateral relationship and global challenges, such as the effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, as well as efforts to support our two countries' wounded warrior through the Invictus Games, which Dr. Biden attended earlier this year in London.'

Prince William is also gave speech at the World Bank today for the International Corruption Hunters Alliance on how to stop poaching and wildlife trafficking.

Landing with a bump: Prince William and Kate got the royal welcome when they arrived in New York City on Sunday night for a whirlwind official visit

'In my view, one of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in the world today is the illegal wildlife trade,' he said.  

'Some endangered species are now literally worth more than their weight in gold, which makes it even harder for governments and international bodies to counter this trade. For example, according to some reports, in China and South East Asia the wholesale street price of ivory has increased from $5 to $2,100 per kilogram in 25 years. And this is reflected in increases in poaching.'

However, he singled out China as taking steps to combat poaching - despite it being the world's largest market for illegally trafficked goods. 

'Another highly commendable example is in China, where the government working in partnership with local NGOs is successfully curbing the trade in shark fins,' he said. 

Stayed behind: While her husband was meeting President Barack Obama, Hate, the Duchess of Cambridge, met New York City's First Lady, Chirlane McCray in Harlem

Kate met children at the Northside Center for Childhood Development in Harlem in Manhattan - part of her charity outreach 

She was greeted with a bouquet of roses and hundreds of adoring fans - despite some students saying they thought Princess Elsa from Disney's Frozen would be coming instead of Kate

Obama has called the issue 'a devastating environmental problem' and applauded the Duke of Cambridge's activism. 

Prince William rejoined his wife back in New York by mid-afternoon. He boarded a 2pm US Airways shuttle flight - flying first class again. 

CNN anchor Anderson Cooper happened to be on the same flight. 

'I'm hoping this means on-time departure,' Cooper quipped.  

Prince William's surprise invitation to the White House shows that he is working to become the new public face of the Royal Family as his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, approaches her 90s. 

The prince, who is training as an air ambulance pilot in England, has only once before visited the United States on official business - in 2011 when he and Kate made a brief stop in California following a tour of Canada.

This is also the first trip for the Duke and Duchess that does not have them visiting a Commonwealth nation.
