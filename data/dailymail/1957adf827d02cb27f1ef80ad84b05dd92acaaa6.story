The shocking moment that thugs used a home-made battering ram to smash their way into a family home was captured on CCTV.

The three burglars threatened the occupants with knives before breaking into the garage and stealing an Audi A5 and a BMW motorbike.

The men, dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas, were caught on an outside security camera as they raided the property in Blackley, Greater Manchester last Thursday.

Their faces covered with balaclavas, the men lift up the battering ram - ready to break down the door

They used a makeshift battering ram to break through the locked front door shortly after 10.30pm, police said.

Once inside, the three men split up, with one holding a 7in kitchen knife to the first victim’s throat while one of the other men went upstairs and threatened the second victim with a knife.

Keys to the victims' Audi A5 and BMW motorcycle were taken, along with a motorcycle helmet and leathers. The thieves drove away from the raid in the vehicles.

The thugs are described as white men, all wearing dark clothing and full face balaclavas. They all spoke with local accents.

The Audi car was found abandoned a short time later in Blackley but the BMW motorcycle is still missing.

Detective Constable Peter Murphy said: 'This was a terrifying experience for the victims, who not only suffered the shock of seeing their front door smashed open but were also terrorised by men brandishing knives. 

'The thieves seemed to know exactly what they were doing and knew what they were after, so it appears as though this robbery was planned in advance.

'The CCTV does not offer much in terms of identification of these thugs, but I urge people to watch the video and contact police if they believe they recognise any of the three robbers pictured.'
