A man who was shot 20 times with a pellet gun for appearing to be Middle Eastern refused to retaliate even though he had an actual gun on him at the time.

'I don't know. I just couldn't do it,' Cameron Mohammed said when asked why he did not shoot back at Daniel Quinnell when Quinnell attacked him in the parking lot of a Walmart in Lutz, Florida.

Quinnell believed that Mohammed was Muslim or from the Middle East but he is neither: he was born and raised in Florida and his parents are from Trinidad, and he is Catholic.

Surveillance video shows Quinnell, who has been arrested 10 times with a number of battery and assault charges, approached 24-year-old Mohammed as he was walking into the store around 3am on Wednesday with his girlfriend.

Victim and attacker: Cameron Mohammed (left) was born in Florida and his parents are from Trinidad, but Daniel Quinnell (right) assumed that he was Muslim and from the Middle East, neither of which are true

He told police that as he and his girlfriend- whose name has not been released- walked from their car into the Walmart to get some food, Quinnell asked Mohammed if he was Muslim or if he was from the Middle East.

Mohammed is neither, as his parents are from Trinidad but he was born and raised in Tampa, and he is Catholic.

Mohammed simply replied no and kept walking, but that was not sufficient for Quinnell. The 25-year-old allegedly yelled at Mohammed for being a 'n***** with a white girl' as he shot him with a gas-propelled pellet gun.

First shot: After asking if Mohammed is Muslim or from the Middle East, Quinnell begins to fire his pellet gun at close range and Mohammed's girlfriend takes his prior advice and looks for cover

Firing: Quinnell went on to fire 20 shots at Mohammed before running away

When police finally captured Quinnell and told him that Mohammed was neither Muslim nor Middle Eastern, he reportedly replied that he didn't care and 'they're all the same'.

The security footage shows Mohammed's girlfriend quickly run to hide behind a column as the shooter begins to fire at close range at her boyfriend.

Mohammed told The Tampa Bay Times that there was a reason for her move, as Mohammed said that he previously told her that if they were ever in harm's way, that she would stay quiet and find cover.

The video also shows Mohammed's hand go for his waist where he kept his holstered gun, but he never chose to fire.

'I couldn't blow this guy away for something he could change later in life. I'm not going to decide this man's fate,' Mohammed told The Tamba Bay Times.

He bought his weapon legally and has had a concealed weapons permit for the past five years.

Quinnell's
weapon was also legal: he told officers that he knew he was not allowed
to own a firearm so he purchased a pellet gun, which uses compressed 
air inside metal casings making it a non-lethal weapon.

That said, it still did damage to Mohammed as he now has to have surgery to have a pellet removed from above his eye.

Tipped off: Police released security footage from the Walmart that showed Quinnell's face, leading to his own mother tipping them off about his whereabouts

Criminal history: Quinnell has been arrested 10 previous times and he said that he knew he was not allowed to have a real gun because of those felonies so that is why he used a pellet gun

'This is a heinous crime, there's no doubt about it,' Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said.

Police eventually captured Quinnell with the help of his own mother. She called the tipline and told them the room number that he was staying in at the Comfort Inn off a highway on Land O'Lakes. He was charged with aggravated assault.

There are haunting similarities between this assault and the incident in New York City where a racist woman pushed a man she believed to be Middle Eastern onto the subway tracks as a train was approaching.

That victim, Sunando Sen, was from India and not the Middle East, and the attacker, Erika Menendez, used 'Hindu' and 'Muslim' interchangeably in her police statement, showing that she clearly does not understand the difference.

The New York Police Department spokesman described her statement as effectively saying: 'I pushed a Muslim off the train tracks because I hate Hindus and Muslims ever since 2001 when they put down the twin towers Iâ€™ve been beating them up.'

Sen died on the tracks in Queens on December 29.
