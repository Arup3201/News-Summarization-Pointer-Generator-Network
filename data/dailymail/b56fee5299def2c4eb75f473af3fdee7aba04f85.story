Confession: Saleh al-Arouri told Islamic Scholars in Turkey that Hamas fighters snatched the teenagers 

A veteran Hamas fighter, who founded the militant group's combat wing, has admitted that they abducted the three Israeli teenagers whose kidnaps triggered the current conflict in Gaza.

Saleh al-Arouri, a long-standing member of Hamas, said 'heroic' fighters grabbed the teenagers, two of whom were 16 and one 19.

They were later found dead, which helped galvanise Israel's bombing raids and ground operations in the Gaza strip.

Hamas had previously refused to comment on Israel's accusations that it was behind the abductions in Hebron, on the West Bank.

Speaking at a convention of Islamic scholars in Istanbul, Turkey, where he lives in exile, al-Arouri said: 'There was much speculation about this operation, some said it was a conspiracy'.

'The popular will was exercised throughout our occupied land, and culminated in the heroic operation by the Qassam Brigades [the armed wing of Hamas] in imprisoning the three settlers in Hebron.'

'This was an operation from your brothers in Qassam undertaken to aid their brothers on hunger strike in (Israeli) prisons,' he added.

However, no other Hamas figures have backed up the statement, which some experts have said sounds far-fetched.

Kidnapped and killed: Naftali Frenkel (who was also an American citizen), left, and Gilad Shaar, right, were just 16 when they were kidnapped from the West Bank

Victim: 19-year-old Eyal Yifrach was the third victim. Their bodies were recently found with bullet wounds

The revelation came on a day when Hamas' morale had taken a blow following the funerals of three senior military commanders.

The bodies of Mohammed Abu Shamaleh, Mohammed Barhoum and Raed al-Attar were carried aloft through the crowd on stretchers wrapped in green Hamas flags.

A Hamas spokesman said Israel 'will not succeed in breaking the will of our people or weaken the resistance', adding that their enemies 'will pay the price.'

The men were killed in a pre-dawn strike, which levelled a four-story house in the town of Rafah.

Six people were killed, including the three senior Hamas commanders.

Israel said the trio had played a key role in expanding Hamas's military capabilities in recent years, including digging attack tunnels leading to Israel, training fighters and smuggling weapons to Gaza.

The latest wave of violence in Gaze ensued in the wake of the kidnappings of seminary students Eyal Yifrach, 19, and Gilad Shaer and Naftali Fraenkel, both 16, in June.

They were abducted while hitchiking in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on June 12 and killed.

Israel promptly accused Hamas, which is based in Gaza but has a presence in the West Bank, of masterminding the attack and began a crackdown on the group in which over a thousand Palestinians were arrested.

Tensions already ran deep in the West Bank after weeks of a mass hunger strike by Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, who is in exile in Qatar, denied knowledge of the abduction but praised its perpetrators.

Nearly three weeks after the kidnappings, 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khudair, a Palestinian living in East Jerusalem, was abducted, beaten and burned to death by, prosecutors said, a group of Jewish extremists.

Protests broke out in Abu Khudair's neighbourhood and Hamas responded by firing rockets at Israel from Gaza.

That escalated into a full-scale war with Israel in which more than 2,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed, as well as 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel.

Two Palestinian suspects Israel has named as the kidnappers of the three seminary students remain at large.

Israel said a third suspect arrested by its security forces admitted under interrogation to organizing the kidnapping with funds from Hamas in Gaza.
