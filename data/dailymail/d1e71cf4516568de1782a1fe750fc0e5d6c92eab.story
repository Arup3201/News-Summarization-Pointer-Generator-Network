Payday loans company Wonga has been accused of 'censorship by stealth' after using legal threats to remove a work of parody from the internet.

Twitter user @Brandy_Snap posted an image showing an 18th-Century debtors' prison, with the Wonga logo superimposed, including the mock catchphrase 'Your soul is ours'.

The image was highlighting widespread anger at the loans company, which offers loans at representative annual interest rates of 5853 per cent.

Legal threats: Wonga took legal action over this image, which superimposes a character from its adverts onto a scene of a debtors' prison

And in a bizarre move, Wonga then called its own legal team 'soulless' for trying to suppress the image, which has now been posted hundreds more times in protest.

It features a painting by William Hogarth, an artist famous for depicting social decay in the 1700s, with the head of one of Wonga's puppet-like TV advert characters superimposed on a figure.

The Wonga mascot is surrounded by wretched and impoverished captives in London's Fleet Prison, where hundreds of people who owed money were subjected to cruel punishments.

The original image is part of a Hogarth series called A Rake's Progress, which shows the rise and fall of a wealthy man who squanders his fortune and ends up destitute.

The legal notice, delivered by Twitter, is signed by 
representative James Johnson from the legal department of Wonga's parent
 company. It accuses the owner of the Twitter account of infringing the 
company's copyright by using part of its adverts.

Original: The famous scene shows wretched figures stuck in Fleet prison, where debtors were sent in the 1700s

The
 text of the warning identifies 'infringing acts' on the grounds that 
Wonga did not give its permission for the images to be used. However it has been claimed that the legal complaint is baseless and that the company is simply using its legal muscle to quash dissent.

Speaking to MailOnline the Twitter user, who declined to be named, said the legal complaint was a 'pretext'.

The image seized upon for the parody is one of an eight-part series by Hogarth depicting the rise and fall of a wealthy man.

Tom Rakewell, the central figure, inherits from his miserly father and proceeds to spend all the money on his lavish lifestyle.

He quickly squanders all his money on clothes, women and parties, landing him in Fleet prison, which is the penultimate frame of the series.

Rakewell can be seen surrounded by angry creditors, while his wife and lover languish in the corner.

In the next picture he has been driven insane and languished in the Bedlam Hospital lunatic asylum.

Hundreds of years later the pictures inspired Igor Stravinsky to writer an opera of the same name.

They are currently housed in Sir John Soane's museum in Central London.

He said: 'Wonga
 have decided to take this aggressive approach to squashing any parody 
or criticism of their company, using the pretext of copyright abuse.

'I
 think there's an important point of principle here. If they get away 
with this, it's the beginning of censorship by stealth on Twitter.

'I've taken advice and it's been pointed out that Wonga are on really rocky ground with this. But
 if it came to the crunch it would mean traipsing over to a Californian 
court and I haven't got the time or the money to go there.

'Of
 course the whole thing has rebounded on them. They're getting so much 
adverse publicity, and everybody has started retweeting it.'

When contacted by the MailOnline for comment, Wonga refused to explain why it took the action, beyond referencing a tweet which described its own lawyers as 'soulless'.

A post on the OpenWonga Twitter feed responding to an outcry about the move said: 'What can we say? Our lawyers are a soulless bunch and take the protection of our brand very seriously.'

Although Wonga only recently decided to take action, the image in question was first published in January this year for a satirical competition.

'Aggressive': The take-down notice sent to the Twitter user accuses him of copyright infringements

The complaint was prompted by the image being uploaded again on April 6, which led to the take-down notice being submitted yesterday.

Prominent figures including the Archbishop of Canterbury have attacked the company for the way it treats its customers, who are often left in severe financial difficulty.

Last year Justin Welby said he told Wonga's boss that the Church of England aimed to 'compete you out of existence' by backing community-based lending schemes instead, with lower interest rates.

Wonga was in the spotlight again this week after the Advertising Standards Agency banned an advert designed to explain away the huge 5853 per cent interest rates.

The ad, which attempted to demonstrate how consumers would never actually pay thousands of per cent of interest on the loans because they are too short-term, was deemed to be confusing and that Wonga was being 'irresponsible' in trying to distract attention from the high rates.
