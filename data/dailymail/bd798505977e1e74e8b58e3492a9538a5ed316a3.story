The average person switches between devices as many as 21 times an hour, a new survey has revealed.

Research revealed our attention span is smaller than ever thanks to the growing presence of smartphones, tablets and laptops.

Advertising researchers tracked the online behavior of 200 British people to discover how much time they spent on one device before picking up another.

A new study has revealed the average British person switches between gadgets as many as 21 times a day

The method of research is favoured by Facebook and Google who try to follow users between gadgets so they can later prove to the success of online adverts.

The websites try to monitor users' devices to prove that an advert seen on a smartphone at lunchtime encouraged someone to later make a purchase on their laptop, for example.

But the research carried out by OMD produced startling results that come months after it was revealed the number of people simultaneously using devices has increased by 500 per cent in three years.

Insight Director Chris Worrell told the Business Insider: 'We think brands need to experiment with new formats that fit with these new consumption patterns,' adding that users are always 'one step away from distrction'.

'Things like skippable ads on YouTube are almost priming people to expect that after the first five seconds of an ad, you can choose to stay with it or move on.'

The average person uses three devices - a smartphone, computer and tablet and can switch between them effortlessly to perform simple tasks

The internet giant Google has welcomed the phenomenon which they call 'constant connectivity'

In September it was revealed that 90 per cent of people switch effortlessly between gadgets to perform simple tasks.

In addition, 77 per cent of online searches carried out from a mobile phone occurred in places where the user could have used as easily used a computer.

Google has described the phenomenon as 'constant connecticity' and has welcomed it as a means of effective marketing.

'By adding information about where someone is, what device they’re using, and the time of day, marketers can figure out the best message to show them – not just at that moment, but for that moment,' vice president for marketing in America said.
