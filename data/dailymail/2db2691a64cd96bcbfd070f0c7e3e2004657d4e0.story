The parents of a six-year-old girl who died after suffering a fit at a campsite said today they were devastated at the loss of the youngster who they described as 'our whole world'.

Isabelle Harris died in the early hours of yesterday morning in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest at the Holmsley campsite in the New Forest, Hampshire.

Today, her parents Lee and Tracey Harris, from Gosport, Hampshire, said in a statement: 'We are all absolutely devastated about what has happened.

Investigation: Forensic officers at the tent where the little girl was discovered

'No words are strong enough to describe how we feel at the moment.

'Isabelle was our whole world; 
everything we ever did was for her. She was a really special girl and 
this is a huge loss to everyone who knew her.'

The statement continued: 'The police investigation has concluded and a file will be passed to the coroner.

'We really don't want to discuss this 
further. We want to find out why this happened and we would like to 
leave the police to get on with this.

'We would like to thank the owners of 
the campsite for their assistance and apologise to other campers on the 
site who were there to enjoy their bank holiday weekend.

'We would like to give special thanks to the first responders and paramedics who treated Isabelle at the campsite.

'Our thanks also go to Hampshire 
Constabulary. We thank them for the way they have treated us, being as 
open and honest as they can. We also appreciate their ongoing support 
and have no issues with their actions.'

Mr Harris, 30, and Mrs Harris, 40, were arrested on suspicion of murder after the death.

But Hampshire Police said last night 
that a post-mortem examination had found there were no suspicious 
circumstances surrounding the death of Isabelle and said it was a 
'tragic incident'.

The death led to a sombre mood at the campsite yesterday, with many campers leaving early.

Witnesses told of hearing screaming and a car horn repeatedly being sounded before paramedics and police arrived.

No date for an inquest opening into the death has been set.

Gathering clues: Police carry out their investigations at the site

Inquiries underway: Reports suggest the girl suffered a cardiac arrest in an incident which police are treating as suspicious

Mystery: An officer conducts inquiries with other campers at the site as police try to establish what led to the girl's cardiac arrest. Her parents are believed to have made desperate attempts to resuscitate their daughter at the scene
