A 71-year-old former lab worker has been sentenced to a year and a day in prison for conspiring with her physicist husband to sell secrets about nuclear weapons.

Marjorie Roxby Mascheroni, who worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, pleaded guilty to plotting to reveal classified nuclear data.

Her husband, 79-year-old scientist Pedro Leonardo Mascheroni, is in federal custody pending his sentencing after admitting to providing weapons plans to an FBI officer masquerading as a Venezuelan agent.

U.S. District Judge William P Johnson also sentenced Mrs Mascheroni to  three years of supervised release after her jail term, during the hearing at Albuquerque courthouse.

Her one year sentence is well under the mandatory 14-year minimum she could have faced if she had been convicted at trial.

The former lab worker admitted that between 2007 and 2009, she conspired with her husband to convey restricted data belonging to the United States to secure an advantage for Venezuela.

She did technical writing and editing at the national laboratory which was the site of the secret Manhattan Project that developed the world's first atomic weapon during World War II.

Her husband was a scientist at the national security lab from 1979 to 1988.

Mr Mascheroni was trying to help Venezuela build missiles and a nuclear bomb, along with a secret underground facility for a nuclear reactor and production of 'mini-bombs', according to federal authorities.

But the officials said that the country, under former President Hugo Chavez, played no role in the scheme.

According to their indictments, the 79-year-old physicist also suggested an explosion over New York that could produce an 'electromagnetic pulse' to knock out the metropolis' electrical power.

He also put forward an idea to build a laser that could blind satellites and create a defence 'umbrella,' able to retaliate against attacks with nuclear bombs.

Mr Mascheroni pleaded guilty to six counts in June 2013 and faces up to 5-and-a-half years in prison.
