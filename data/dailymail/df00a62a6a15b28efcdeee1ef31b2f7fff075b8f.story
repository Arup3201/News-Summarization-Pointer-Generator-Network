Having re-kindled and then once again split from Joey Essex this year, Sam Faiers is determined not to wake up alone on Christmas Day.

Focusing instead on the new addition to the family - her sister Billie's new baby- Sam spoke exclusively to FEMAIL about her plans for the festive season, revealing she will be sleeping at her sister's house on Christmas Eve.

The 23-year-old said: 'This Christmas is going to be a really special one for my family and I as it's Nelly's first. We're going to go all out and make sure she has the best first Christmas ever!

Sam and her sister Billie are very close, and Sam has revealed she will be spending Christmas with her

Sam is particularly excited as this is her niece's first Christmas (here helping push the pram with Billie) 

Sam and Joey Essex, who rekindled their romance this year, have once again split up

'I'm going to stay at Billie's on Christmas Eve so I'm not on my own when I wake up at Christmas Day.

'The whole family are going to Billie's for Christmas lunch and it's going to be a lot of games and catching up!'  

On Friday, Sam Faiers looked very much the doting aunt as she stepped out with her adorable niece and sister Billie during an outing in Essex.

The star was seen giving the little tot a tender kiss on her forehead, while she lovingly cradled her in her arms.

Sam also stepped out for another festive outing this week - this time joining forces with Tesco to give one fan an unforgettable Christmas.

Maisie Bone, 19, from Kent, was given the ultimate surprise when she found Sam at her door on Sunday night.

The former TOWIE star arrived with her glam squad in tow to give Maisie a makeover in time for Christmas Day.

Sam even offered some of her top styling and beauty tips for the festive season.

She said: 'I love getting glammed up with my girls for Christmas parties, so I jumped at the chance to surprise Maisie with a makeover treat. It was clear from her reaction when we knocked on her door that she had no idea we were coming. I really hope Tesco and I have helped make Maisie's Christmas unforgettable this year!'

Maisie said: 'Opening the door to Sam Faiers was like a dream come true – I'm such a huge fan. I love my new hair style and make-up and got some great styling tips from Sam. I can't believe Tesco organised this for me – best Christmas present ever.'

Danny Coleman-Cooke, Tesco spokesman, said: 'We saw on Twitter that Maisie was a huge fan of Sam and so we wanted to bring the ultimate Christmas surprise to her front door. We hope that together with Sam we've given Maisie a Christmas she'll never forget.'

This early Christmas present is part of the supermarket's Every Little Helps Make Christmas campaign, which aims to go the extra mile for customers this Christmas and help them in whatever way they can, big or small.
