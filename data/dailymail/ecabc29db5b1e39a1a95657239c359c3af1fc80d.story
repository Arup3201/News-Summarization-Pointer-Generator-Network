Scotland is on course to reject independence, the leader of the campaign to save the Union has confidently predicted.

Better Together leader Alistair Darling insisted internal campaign research put them comfortably ahead, but he suggested half a million people in Scotland have not decided how to vote with opinion polls suggesting the race is neck and neck.

First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that people saying they would vote against his dream of independence were 'only deferred ‘Yes’-es', as he faced claims he was embarking on a 'premature victory lap' with four days until the historic referendum.

Better Together leader Alistair Darling revealed he thinks that as many as 500,000 of the 4.2million people in Scotland have still not decided how to vote in Thursday's referendum

Mr Darling accused his opponent, First Minister Alex Salmond, of embarking on a victory lap instead of answering a string of questions about the key issues facing an independent Scotland

Mr Darling insisted that canvas returns from the Better Together campaign show No is on course for victory.

‘We will win and I know that because I have seen the returns. Be in no doubt about it,’ he said.

‘Our returns are good. Our vote is holding up and we are actually doing very well.

He suggested that some voters will go to the ballot box still ‘swithering in their own mind’ about which way to vote and candidly admitted: ‘The situation is quite fluid’. 

More than 4.2million people have registered to vote in the historic referendum which will decide the fate of the 307-year-old Union. Experts predict the turnout could be as high as 85 per cent.

But speaking in Edinburgh yesterday, Mr Darling told journalists there are half a million people who have yet to settle on their decision.

He said: 'We have been contacting tens of thousands of people in the last few weeks and our best estimate is of about 500,000 people we think are still to make their minds up.

‘You do get people at this late stage where people are going from yes to no to yes and back again.

‘The situation is quite fluid. There will be a lot of people who my guess is when they go into the polling station may be swithering in their own mind.

‘People maybe in the space of a day might change their mind. I do believe the silent majority in Scotland does not want to take on the risks of independence.’

The latest raft of opinion polls all point to differing results, but suggest the result is too close to call.

A Panelbase survey for The Sunday Times put No on 50.6 per cent and Yes 49.4 per cent.

A poll by Survation gave the No campaign an eight-point lead on 54 per cent to 46 per cent while an Opinium survey in The Observer put No on 53 per cent and Yes 47 per cent.

However, a surprise ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph put the Yes campaign eight points ahead, on 54 per cent, although it was based on a survey size of only 700 people.

The opponents appeared on the BBC Andrew Marr show to discuss Thursday's vote. SNP leader Alex Salmond looked jovial as he attempted to play the violin 

Confident: Chairman of the Better Together campaign, Alistair Darling, said he was certain Scots would vote against independence after reviewing internal research 

When asked about the number of voters yet to choose a side, of which there are an estimated 500,000, Alex Salmond referred to them as 'deferred Yes-es'. He joined Scottish singer Amy McDonald (right) and bands Franz Ferdinand, Frightened Rabbit and Mogwai at Edinburgh's Usher Hall today 

'Premature victory lap': With just four days until the historic vote, the First Minister of Scotland said he was already certain voters would sway towards independence and is celebrating in advance

But he warned that the result would be decisive. ‘If we vote to leave by one vote there is no going back. We will have bought a one way ticket with no return. This is not something we can try out.’

He said that with five days to go until the vote, there were still five questions about jobs, currency, pensions, prices and funding public services which Mr Salmond has failed to answer.

In an interview on BBC1’s Andrew Marr show today, he accused Mr Salmond of doing a “premature victory lap” ahead of the polling day. “We still don’t know how we can ensure that we don’t lose jobs, with firms saying they are going to take their headquarters out of Scotland – that would be a disaster for Scotland.

‘We still don’t know how we are going to replace the additional funding we get for the National Health Service.

‘We don’t know who is going to pay pensions and you were asking Alex Salmond a few moments ago about currency and he seemed to be doing a rather premature victory lap even before most of us have voted.

‘But he was just simply asserting that low and behold on Friday morning, everybody else is wrong, they are all going to fall in line with what he is going to say.’

Planning ahead: The First Minister let slip he was planning to attend the Ryder Cup if the vote for independence is secured on Thursday 

With conflicting polling results being published with just four days to go and an estimated half-a-million voters still undecided, Mr Darling (right) said the situation was 'fluid'. Experts have said the race is too close to call at this point 

The opposing campaign leaders shook hands this morning after an appearance on the Andrew Marr show 

The latest Poll of Polls, compiled by political expert Professor John Curtice at WhatScotlandThinks.Com, puts the No campaign narrowly ahead on 51 per cent. It follows four new polls overnight, with only an ICM survey for the Sunday Telegraph giving the Yes campaign a lead, which based based on a smaller-than-normal sample of only 700 people

As the battle over independence hots, last night saw a spectacular fireworks display and Vikings carrying flaming torches to mark the 50th anniversary of the Forth Road Bridge

Mr Salmond insisted if Scotland votes for independence, it will be a 'day of celebration'

Mr Salmond today let slip that he is planning a visit to watch the Ryder Cup golf tournament within days of breaking up the 300-year-old Union.

The Scottish First Minister revealed that if he secures victory in his battle for independence, he will travel to Gleneagles to watch the likes of Rory McIlroy and Tom Watson teeing off.

After dire warnings that Yes vote could trigger economic catastrophe, No campaigners accused Mr Salmond of embarking on a 'premature victory lap' instead of answering key questions about how independence would work in practice.

 But he also insisted that there will be 'urgent business following a Yes victory on Friday', adding: 'Firstly I think it will be a day of celebration, Scotland will have achieved something astonishing in democratic politics. 'But there's a lot of business to do. And the first and urgent business is to bring Scotland together.

'Because on Friday, after a Yes vote there'll cease to be a Yes campaign and a No campaign. There'll be a Team Scotland. And I've said very clearly that I want into that Team Scotland as many voices as possible, people who have got something to offer and contribute to bring the country together.'

He went on: 'One of the great assets of the Yes campaign is we don’t regard any section or sector of Scottish society or any geography of Scotland beyond our reach. 

'We tend to take the attitude that there isn’t so much a ‘No’ vote in Scotland. There are only deferred ‘Yes’-es. And that’s been one of the successes of our campaign…'

He vowed that that if he loses Thursday's vote, he will not try to force another referendum.

'If you remember previous constitutional referenda in Scotland, there was one in 1979 and the next one was 1997.

'That's what I mean by a political generation… This is a once in a generation, perhaps even a once in a lifetime opportunity for Scotland.'

Mr Salmond's wife Moria is reportedly credited with encouraging the First Minister to regularly take time out from the referendum campaign to play golf to 'unwind and clear his head', according to the Sunday Times.

It also emerged that Mr Salmond was playing against the 14-year-old son of the greenkeeper at Castle Stuart golf course overlooking the Moray Firth when news broke of an opinion poll putting the Yes campaign ahead last weekend.
