A Chinese woman escaped with inches to spare when her car was impaled on a road fence.

Four-months pregnant Liu Yun was driving, with her husband in the passenger seat, at the time of the accident in Chongqing Municipality, southwest China.

According to Mrs Liu, the car spun out of control and as she leaned onto her husband, the fence went through the car on the driverâ€™s side.

The 25ft broken fence penetrated in from the front of the car and out from the driver's window.

Mrs Liu said: 'My car suddenly out of control, and I unconsciously leaned to my husband side after seeing it sliding to the fence'

The broken fence skewered the vehicle missing Mrs Liu, who escaped unscathed, by a matter of inches.

The
 incident is a lucky version of what happened to DIYer Yang Yi Kui, 55, 
from Jiangsu province, China, who is recovering his hospital after he 
accidentally fired a three inch-long nail into his skull earlier this 
week.

However, for some 
unknown reason he did not even realise the nail had ripped through his 
skull until he went to the hospital feeling sick and it was discovered 
by doctors.

Mr Yang said it all went so fast, and the nail left only a tiny hole in his skin, that he thought it was just a scratch.
