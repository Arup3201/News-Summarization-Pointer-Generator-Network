Bigfoot has long been considered a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, but on Tuesday a team of researchers screened what they claim is conclusive evidence that the creature, also known as Sasquatch, exists.

During a news conference in Texas, the group of experts played several short clips that they described as ‘never before seen HD video’ of the supposed ape-like creature.

The footage consisted of very short, grainy and out-of-focus clips of various apparently human-like, hairy figures moving about in wooded areas in Kentucky.

After five years and $500,000, the Sasquatch Genome Project presented footage on Tuesday which it claims is conclusive proof that Bigfoot exists

The Sasquatch Genome Project team hope that their evidence will go some way to convincing a highly skeptical public about the existence of Bigfoot

In the face of a highly skeptical public and few conclusive sightings, The Sasquatch Genome Project has spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years.

‘This was a serious study,’ Dr. Melba Ketchum told WFAA. She is an expert in forensics and is a director of the project after being impressed by the evidence.

The exclusive footage came from a similar effort dubbed The Erickson Project, which was led by Adrian Erickson. That group said it captured the 'definitive video and DNA evidence from the elusive Sasquatch.'

During Tuesday's news conference, several clips were shown which the group claims is video evidence that proves Bigfoot is real.

It included footage captured in 
Kentucky in 2005 shows a female Sasquatch sleeping. An extended version 
of the video is expected to be released in a future documentary.

‘We've
all had experiences that changed our lives,’ said researcher Dennis 
Pfohl, who showed photos he had taken of footprints in the snow that he 
believed belonged to Sasquatch.

The announcement comes a week after a new map was unveiled that plots out every reported Bigfoot sighting in North America for the last 92 years.

PhD candidate Josh Stevens
mapped out the 3,313 possible Sasquatch spots since 1921 and found that
people do seem to glimpse the hairy creature much more in some regions 
than others.

The map and data collated by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization show, for example, that Bigfoot has supposedly been spotted three times more often in Missouri than neighboring Kansas.

Dr. Melba Ketchum said she joined the project after being impressed by the evidence, while researcher Dennis Pfohl said all of the team had ‘had experiences that changed our lives’

Stevens
explains on his website: 'Right away you can see that sightings are not
evenly distributed. At first glance, it looks a lot like a map of 
population distribution.'

This makes sense - by a law of averages you would expect an area with more people to report more possible Sasquatch viewings.

Even
so, there are some very bright spots around the Ohio River Valley, 
Mississippi River Valley, the Sierra Nevada mountains, central Florida 
and the Pacific Northwest.

Yet it gets intriguing when Stevens maps the relationship between reported sightings and population density. 

As he notes: 'There are distinct regions where sightings are incredibly common, despite a very sparse population.

Spotting a sasquatch? There are regions of U.S where sightings are very common, despite a low population. And most of them are in the West

'On the other hand, in some of the most densely populated areas Sasquatch sightings are exceedingly rare.' 

Most of these Bigfoot hot spots are in the Western United States.

Stevens acknowledges that 'terrain and habitat likely play a major role in the distribution of reports.'

He notes that the population data 
is based on Census figures that only take into account where people 
live, not where they vacation or travel.

Stevens
also says that the reporting mechanism is not hugely precise as the 
Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) only allow spotters to 
enter the nearest city.
