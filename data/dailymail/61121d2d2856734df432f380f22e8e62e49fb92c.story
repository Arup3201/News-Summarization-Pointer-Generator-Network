Hospitals have been told to free up their beds in the next two weeks in an attempt to head off an Easter bank holiday crisis in the NHS.

GP surgeries have also been ordered to open on Easter Saturday to help take the strain from over-stretched A&E departments.

Health officials anticipate that services already under pressure will struggle to keep up with demand this Easter.

NHS England has drawn up emergency plans amid fears casualty departments will be unable to cope with high demand over the four-day break, which starts on April 3, while staff numbers are low.

As many patients as possible must be discharged from hospital in the next fortnight so casualty departments will not be over capacity before the start of the bank holiday.

The warnings come after hospitals suffered one of the worst performances on record over the Christmas holidays.

Waiting times in emergency departments are at a record high, partly because so many patients are unable to get an appointment with their GP.

A memo from Barbara Hawkin, the NHS deputy chief executive, was sent out to all NHS trusts and groups of GPs.

The unprecedented 11-point plan for GPs, hospitals and social services departments said it is ‘critical’ organisations have ‘resilience plans’ in order to cope with the mounting pressure. 

It means patients who go to A&E in desperation, because they are unable to get an appointment with a family doctor, will no longer clog up waiting times for emergency care. 

Over Christmas, 13 hospitals declared 'major incidents' when A&E units shut their doors to seriously ill patients. Pictured are ambulances queuing up outside the Royal Blackburn Hospital in January 

The NHS was plunged into crisis over Christmas when 13 hospitals declared ‘major incidents’ and A&E units shut their doors to paramedics trying to bring in seriously ill patients.

‘Major incidents’ mean the hospitals have put in place emergency measures usually reserved for mass casualties such as those seen after airline crashes or terrorist attacks.

Figures showed waiting times in England were at their worst in a decade – and that in the last three months of 2014 almost 21,000 patients had languished on trolleys for up to 12 hours.

In one shocking case, an 81-year-old grandmother who had fallen in her home had to wait 11 hours for an ambulance and then had another 60-minute wait on a trolley in a hospital corridor. 

Some patients reported having to ‘fight’ their way into casualty units packed like ‘nightclubs’.

It is feared that, with hospitals and GPs already struggling to meet targets, there could be another disastrous waiting time crisis this Easter.

An NHS England spokesman said last night: ‘While we are pleased to have come through a difficult period, now is a good time to reinforce our message that we are resolved to driving up performance in the coming weeks and throughout the year.’
