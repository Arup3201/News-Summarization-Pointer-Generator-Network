A self-styled 'superhero' has hung up his cape after just two years of fighting crime - because he has been beaten up by yobs.

Roger Hayhurst, 20, was attacked by a gang of thugs and left with a badly swollen face after they recognised him as the 'Knight Warrior' whilst he was out walking with his fiancee.

The assault has now prompted gardener Roger to give up his night job breaking up fights and tackling anti-social behaviour in Salford, Greater Manchester whilst dressed in a custom-made £200 blue-and-black lycra costume.

During his crime fighting career Roger also handed out clothing and food parcels to the homeless in Manchester city centre.

He became a hit with locals, said he would run for Salford mayor and got himself a slot as a presenter on a local radio station.

Attacked: Roger was left with a badly swollen face after yobs recognised him as the 'Knight Warrior' whilst he was out walking with his fiancee Rebecca

He also got girlfriend, 18-year old Rebecca Wall, who was subsequently nicknamed Knight Maiden after she heard about his exploits.

Today Roger, who now hosts a crime fighting show on Salford City Radio, said: 'We were recognised when we were walking through Salford and some lads started punching me. My face was all swollen.

Loved up: Rebecca Wall fell in love with Roger after reading about his Super Hero lifestyle as the Knight Warrior in a magazine and they are now engaged

'After that I still dress up and occasionally patrol, but now I mainly dress up for charity appearances. Rebecca has got rid of her costume now.'

Roger first came to prominence in July 2011, and he caught the attention of Rebecca who wooed him with letters.

The two got engaged and now live together at the home of Roger's mother Jennifer, 62, in Swinton.

Supporting her boyfriend: Rebecca, who earned herself the nickname Knight Maiden has also hung up her cape after what happened

He said: 'I just wanted to do good in the world, that's all. When people saw me coming up it did tend to stun them into silence.

'I just carried on trying to get them to calm down, and eventually most of them did.

'If I think things were getting a bit hairy, I would just back off and phone the police. They knew what I was doing and have been very kind to me.

Home is where the heart is: The loved-up former superhero duo live with Roger's mother

'Some of my friends think I am a bit odd, but all I want to do is try and get people to like each other.'

His mother said she was always 'slightly worried' when her son went out - usually between 9pm-2am, at least three times a week.

But she added: 'His absolute genuineness is his best defence. He is one of the kindest young men I know.'
