Married with a child, Pyretta Blaze and Andy Filth (not their real names) from South Wales, say they're just like any other couple, apart from one slight difference -- they like to drink each other's blood.

Andy and Pyretta, who appeared on This Morning to encourage more open-mindedness for their lifestyle, are part of the UK's 15,000 strong vampire community.

Self-confessed vampire Andy, likened the act of slurping his partners blood to sex and said, 'When you're drinking each others blood you're connected to each others souls.'

He said the taste didn't make him feel sick but admitted, 'It's not like strawberries -- it's got a metallic taste.'

Nowadays the couple satisfy their blood cravings in the privacy of their own bedroom, but in their single days they would go out on the prowl, like any other youngsters.

'I used to go to gatherings where the exchange of blood would happen,' explained Pyretta, who was keen to point out that it was safe and nothing for the public to be scared about.

She assured viewers that they don't lurk around in the dark and only drink blood in the confines of the vampire community.

'Everyone is completely vetted to check they have no mental health history and have a clean blood record,' she said. 'Everyone has a full examination - mentally and physically.'

'You pick one partner you're totally happy with and it's very safe, clean and sterile.'

When Philip then inquired if it was form of sex, she replied, 'Yes, of course!

'We are very health conscious - as you would be when having sex. We are very responsible,' she added.

But one thing that really gets Pyretta's blood boiling is Hollywood's portrayal of vampires.

'It really makes me mad!' she said. 'People are so misled and easily influenced by things in Hollywood.

'I can look into the mirror and do my hair!' she said referring to the myth that if vampires look at their own reflection the mirror cracks.

So what actually goes on behind vampires' bedroom doors? 'You can have a ceremonial pin to draw blood,' Andy explained. 'You don't need a lot, just a small dab.'

'I do it from my neck just behind me ear,' he said revealing a tattoo of a vampire bite on the side of his neck. 'And we do try to use same spot every time.'

'It's not cut deep enough to scar. It's not self harm,' Pyretta was quick to add.

'The amount of blood you drawer depends on what you eat and drink because that affects blood flow,' he explained.Â 

'But we use whatever comes out -- I wouldn't keep cutting,' he said.

Of course, their hobby comes with a health warning and they admitted it's 'enormously dangerous'.'It can't just be done because you feel like it. You have to know what you're doing,' said Andy.

'It's our spiritual connection to each other. We have a child, which makes us as close as we can be. But the next step is to be joined by our souls.

But Andy swears his love for Pyretta trumps his vampire lifestyle. 'If one of us wanted to stop, it wouldn't be over,' he said.

'I see it as bonus. It's something we're both into and a big part of our life. But if it was to go away we wouldn't need to find someone else.

Also on the programme was psychologist, Dr Emyr Williams, who has been studying the vampires for ten years.

'It's a religion,' he explained. 'It's taken me 6 years to get the trust of the community so I can begin my research. It was very difficult because they are often mocked as society doesn't understand them.

'I've found out that these are normal people. They may need to consume blood and psychic energy - but they may not actually like that about themselves.'
