A father who had a tumour  weighing almost a stone on his face is having the last of the growth removed - ten years after it started growing.

Stefan Zoleik,  from Martin, Slovakia, became a social recluse as the fatty lump grew from ear to ear.

Doctors were unable to operate because of health complications. 

But in June last year the 47-year-old underwent a five-hour removal procedure.

Stefan Zoleik, 47, is having corrective surgery in Martin, Slovakia, after a 13lb tumour grew on his neck. He is pictured last year 

Medics are now hoping additional surgery will get rid of all the affected cells.

The former plumber suffers from a rare condition called Madelung disease, which causes tumours to grow.

The problems started in his early 20s when he noticed he was developing a large jaw.

He said: 'Since the surgery last year my life has changed incredibly. I don't know why it wasn't possible for it to be done earlier but I'm just grateful that it has been done now.'

Madelung disease is a rare condition that causes tumours to grow around the neck, shoulders and upper arms.

It usually affects men between the ages of 30 and 70. 

It can lead to a loss of neck mobility and pain.

The growths can also become cancerous in rare circumstances. Their exact cause is unknown.

One benefit of the operation is that it stopped people staring at him in the street. 

Mr Zoleik, a husband and father-of-two, said: 'I'll finally be able to go for a beer with friends without people turning their heads and pointing at me.

'My family were really surprised how well I looked when they came to visit me in the hospital after the operation.

'Over everything else it was my family who helped me the most. They supported me both before and after the surgery, and are my rock that also gave me the strength to recover.'

Mr Zoleik's family said although they were used to his appearance, they were happy he had managed to gain a face that he wanted to show the public.

Igor Homola, a plastic surgeon from the Martin University Hospital, said that despite the initial operation changing Mr Zoleik's life they still have to do the corrective surgery.

He said: 'Even after surgery there will be cells that have kept on growing and we now need to operate to remove those  to fix it.'
