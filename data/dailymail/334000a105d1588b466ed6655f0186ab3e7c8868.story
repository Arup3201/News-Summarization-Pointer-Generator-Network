He's the playboy son of the late footballing legend George Best and has battled with drug and alcohol addiction in the past. 

But as a suited and booted Calum Best entered the Celebrity Big Brother house on Wednesday night the 33-year-old looked better than ever.

But his current dapper image is the result of a new clean-living lifestyle, serious gym time and three hair transplants - now fans wonder if he'll find love on the reality show.

Calum was back to looking his best last night as he entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, the TV personality has reinvented himself over the last few years with a new sleek look

His new sleek look is a far cry from his outfits and hair styles when he first arrived in the UK in 2002 after growing up with mother Angie Best in California.

Despite being a model for River Island his personal style left a lot to be desired.

There were the long-haired years when Calum channeled baggy jeans and vests seemingly in homage to American rap stars.

Then came the era when he when he rocked oversized polo shirts, low-slung trousers and bright white tennis shoes.

In fact it wasn't really until recently that Calum started to develop any fashion finesse.

Last year he attempted the hipster look growing an impressively large bushy beard. However, he ended up shaving it off after it began to take too long to groom.

In his younger years a curly haired Calum, a dead ringer for dad George Best, was a model for River Island

He said: 'It turns into a daily grind making sure it is ship shape. It needs a lot more maintenance than your head hair and you have the added complication of keeping it clean. I feel ten years younger without it.' 

However that wasn't before his facial fuzz helped him land a  cool advertising deal as the star of a Rolls Royce campaign in Dubai in March 2014.

Of course, his new look hasn't come easy. In fact to get his hair so sleek Calum has undergone not one, but three hair transplants after suffering from a receding hairline.

Calum also works hard on his body having previously undergone a ten day bootcamp in Ibiza to get tone himself up.  

In 2003 a young Calum was spotted rocking a long pony tale and some rather questionable vests

Calum's partying ways got him into trouble and in 2007 he declared himself bankrupt

A friend of Calum's said that he's even started his own line of supplements: 'Since changing his partying lifestyle, Calum has put everything into his health and fitness.

'He is at the gym every day and actually personally trains people there as well. He eats very healthily and clean. 

'He co-founded a brand of protein supplements called BestLife which he is passionate about. Since he embarked on this fitness mission he is so happy mind, body and soul with the results and the reaction from other people has been very rewarding.'

And he even hopes he can keep his figure in shape in the Big Brother house: 'Calum hopes that he can maintain this in the CBB house.

As the house doesn't have a gym he sought out advice from his personal trainer, Scott Alexander - who is working with Tom Cruise for Mission Impossible 4 - and has helped him come up with some exercises. 

Before the dapper look he is rocking now Calum went for a bearded hipster vibe 

Being on the high-profile programme is a way for Calum to show how much he has matured since his days as a regular on the London's party circuit.

He is the son of George Best, who became more famous for his addiction to alcohol than his genius on the pitch towards the end of his life in 2005. 

George's issues would haunt Calum who described how he would feel, 'demonic anger,' because of his father's drinking. 

Indeed in 2007 his own life started to fall apart as he spiraled out of control, suffering alcohol and drug addiction. 

Calum said at the time: 'I’m a bad boy. I go out and get drunk, I get high on cocaine and I do stupid debauched things with the wrong women.

Calum had a string of high-profile love interests such as Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding in 2005

Calum and Elizabeth Jagger starred in a Monsoon advert together and have been romantically linked

'I’ve been sowing my oats for years, and I’ve been doing drugs for the past six years. I do drink too much and it gets out of control. 

'The drink leads to the coke and the coke leads to debauchery - the wrong people and places. When I’m high I do wild, stupid s**t. I’m a red-blooded male and I’m addicted to sex.

'I don’t have to be like Dad, but I feel his blood running through my veins. I need to sort out my problems before it’s too late.'

And sow his oats he did. Calum enjoyed a number of high-profile relationships and dated Lindsay Lohan, Kimberley Stewart and was romantically linked to Elizabeth Jagger and Rachel Hunter.

Calum first met Lindsay in London in 2006 when she was in town to host the World Music Awards. 

Up-front: Despite being in the house for less than twenty-four hours, Perez was quick to ask Calum about his relationship with the much-maligned actress - specifically, if they're still in touch

Shortly after they separated, Best opened up about how he really felt about their break-up, saying: ‘She’s a lovely girl and to be honest I don’t know why we ended on such bad terms.

'I have nothing but good things to say about her but for some reason she doesn’t like me.’

Admitting their affair was great fun, when asked if he would like to see Lindsay again while she's in the UK, he said: ‘No, we will definitely not be rekindling what we once had.’ 

Yet despite appearing on a number of television shows such as Celebrity Love Island and having his own show named Totally Calum Best he struggled to keep himself afloat.

In 2013 he declared himself bankrupt.

He said at the time: 'I can confirm I have made the decision to declare myself bankrupt as a result of being unable to make tax repayments.'

'I was blessed to earn a large amount of money at a young age, and mistakes have come with that. But also lessons learned.'

It was then that Calum decided to turn over a new leaf and has since been working on becoming a new man. 

He's already declared his desire to find love in the Big Brother house, it remains to be seen whether he'll gain a new generation of female fans on the Channel 5 show.

Calum has admitted that  he has never been love but he has had no shortage of lovers.

Calum previously dated trouble star Lindsay Lohan 

It has widely been suggested that Calum will be the first to hook up with one of his Celebrity Big Brother castmates. 

In fact he's dated his fair share of models, actresses and TV presenters over the years...
