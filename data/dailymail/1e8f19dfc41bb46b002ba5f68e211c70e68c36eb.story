The police service is the ‘last line of protection against the savagery of the jungle’, a bishop said yesterday at prayers for the two women officers murdered in a gun and grenade attack.

The Roman Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury, the Rt Rev Mark Davies, said ‘the community must stand as one’ to prevent such killings becoming accepted as commonplace.

PC Fiona Bone, 32, and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, were allegedly lured to  a house in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, last Tuesday by reports of  a burglary.

The Bishop of Shrewsbury, the Rt Rev Mark Davies, said the police service is the 'last line of protection against the savagery of the jungle' at a service today

At a service at St James the Great RC 
Church, close to the scene of the tragedy, the bishop said: ‘The sound 
of gunfire and a grenade exploding in the streets of this parish, the 
death of two young women fulfilling their duty, tragically reminds us 
that the police service stands as our last line of defence against the 
savagery of the jungle.

‘If our children are not to grow up 
accepting the murders of Tuesday as commonplace then the police and the 
community must stand as one in defence of human life.

'The police are 
there to protect us, but our protection must also be found within 
ourselves – in the moral values on which our homes and families are 
built, in the strength of our community.’

His strong words came after Sir Peter 
Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester, who stressed the importance
of prayer in his life following the shocking murder of two of his 
officers.

Sir Peter said he took time out every 
day to pray and claimed the police force was a ‘family’ which had been 
devastated by the tragedy.

PC Fiona Bone, 32, and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, died in the attack in a residential street in Mottram, Greater Manchester.

The officers were allegedly lured to a 
house after reports of a burglary and were shot dead close to their 
patrol car when the killer emerged firing a gun.

The Rt Rev Davies was speaking as church services were held across Greater Manchester to remember and pay tribute to the two officers killed on duty last Tuesday.

Bishop Davies told the congregation that he knew the people of Hattersley had ‘come through the darkest of days’ half a century ago following the ‘unspeakable evil of the Moors Murders.’

Earlier, Sir Peter said being a police officer and serving the community was not just a job but a ’vocation’ or ‘calling’.

He said: ‘Greater Manchester police is
a family and to have lost two colleagues this week in awful violent 
circumstances has just been devastating for the whole force and a very, 
very dark day.

‘I think a lot of us feel passionately that policing is a vocation.

‘It
is a calling. I feel that in terms of my own faith but I know a lot of 
officers that don’t have a faith, but feel exactly the same - that it is
a vocation, that it’s not just a job and I think that’s almost what you
go back to in difficult times and difficult circumstances that how 
unfair something may feel, how inadequate you may feel you do actually 
rely on that you’re doing your best, and that this is your vocation.’

Speaking about his Christian values and 
how much he values prayer, he said: ‘The chance for me personally to be 
able to, every day, to have bit of quiet time, pray, think about your 
own values, your own sense of vocation, and to examine your own 
conscience I think is really, really important.

Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said he took time out every day to pray and claimed the police force was a 'family' which had been devastated by the tragedy

‘You do often feel so helpless, so praying for the dead officers, praying for their families, becomes your own reaction, your own expression of hope really for them, at a time of great need.’

Despite the tragedy, the chief constable, who was speaking on the BBC’s Songs of Praise, said he firmly believed police officers in the UK should be unarmed.

He said: ‘We believe very much in what Robert Peel laid down for us back in 1829, that we are a routinely unarmed police force, that we use the minimum of force and that we have this close, very close, connection with the community that we serve and that is really, really important to us.’

The Chief Constable said a vigil would take place for both his staff and the public one week on from the killings.

Dale Cregan, 29, the man charged with the murders, will make his second court appearance today at Manchester Crown Court via videolink from prison.
