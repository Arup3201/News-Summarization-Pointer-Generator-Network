The grieving father acquitted of shooting dead the drunken driver who killed his two sons is living in terror and can't return to his home for fear of 'revenge' attacks, he told MailOnline.

David Barajas has been forced into hiding and told MailOnline that he feared people sympathetic to Jose Banda – the 20-year-old he was cleared of murdering – could now hurt him or his family.

'I am trying to protect my family – my wife, my daughter and our new baby son,' he said. 'The truth is, I am frightened. I am jumpy. We all are. Returning to our home is too much'.

Relief, then fear David Barajas, who was accused of killing a driver who fatally knocked down his two sons along a rural Texas road in 2012, gets a kiss from his wife Cindy after he was acquitted of murder. But now he is living in fear of 'revenge' attacks from people who still blame him for the shooting, he told MailOnline

Intimidating: A memorial to Barajas' two sons David junior and Caleb that stands at the scene of the crash has been vandalized. Milk cartons have been thrown at it and a family friend said they may have links to witchcraft

Barajas' sons David Junior, 12, and Caleb, 11, were helping him push his stalled pick-up truck off their unlit road just before Christmas 2012 when Banda's car plowed into them.

As other motorists called 911, gun shots rang out. Banda, who lived nearby, was killed instantly.

Cops arrested Barajas, who had fought to revive his little boys and was covered in their blood, and threw him into jail.

Two weeks ago, the 32-year-old auto mechanic was acquitted of Banda's murder after a sensational week-long trial.

The triple killings have torn apart the tiny rural community of Alvin, 30 miles from Houston, Texas.

And such is the anger among Banda's associates that the roadside shrine to Barajas' boys has been vandalized on numerous occasions.

Empty milk containers - that some in the Hispanic community say are part of a witchcraft ritual - have been slung on the cluster of white crosses just 100 yards from the family home.

When MailOnline visited one small cross had been snapped in half and balloons had been popped and shredded. Litter was thrown among the plastic flowers and several milk containers had been dumped there.

The following morning, more milk containers had been dumped on top of the roadside shrine.

Barajas said he worried constantly for his wife Cindy, their nine-year-old daughter Jenessah and new baby son. 

'I have to look after them,' he said. 'And I am so afraid of saying anything to offend the other family. They lost somebody too. None of our lives will ever be the same again.

'These people wrote letters to the District Attorney saying they wanted me to get a life sentence. I understand because they are hurt and I was found not guilty. They don't think that is fair.

'But we all lost somebody. They lost a son, I lost my children. We will never get them back and that is something I think of every minute of the day.

'It is a hot subject around here. Some people say they would have shot a man who killed their children, some say not. I am trying to be mature and work out what is best for my family now.

Scared:  David told MailOnline: 'I own my property but I cannot return to it. It isn't just the memories of the boys – and the constant reminder of the place they died across the road – it is the fear'

'I own my property but I cannot return to it. It isn't just the memories of the boys – and the constant reminder of the place they died across the road – it is the fear.

'We've been warned of some gang affiliated things. When I've gone back to my property, cars have driven by slowly.

'I fear that I could be outside one day cleaning up or something and they could come over and hurt me or my family.

'We've had to move out. I rarely go back, even though my auto repair business is there. I've let that slip, I just can't cope. We are struggling but I am doing my best to look after my family and keep my sons' memory alive.

'We can't even afford headstones for the children's graves. I'm told they will cost $15,000 and I don't think I will ever be able to afford that alone.'

Banda's 22-year-old girlfriend Felicia Leija and toddler daughter Alisa live near Barajas' home.

She was not in when the MailOnline called and did not return messages left on his Facebook support page. Numerous other members of Banda's family also live within a quarter-mile.

A friend of Barajas, who attended the court hearing every day to show his support, said: 'David is very frightened. This other family live so near and so dothose who know them and support then and he worries about what [someone] might do.

'Then there are the milk bottles that keep getting dumped on the shrine. Some say this a witchcraft ritual. I keep telling everyone that is nonsense but it all adds to the fear.

'David dreamed of building a big five-bedroom house on his property. He wanted to look after his family, have his auto business yards from his front door and watch his children grow.

'That dream was shattered by a drunk driver just days before Christmas 2012. And then David was arrested for the drunk's murder.

'Every penny he saved went on bond money and lawyers. He has cried over me so many times.

'The police didn't even look into who else could have killed Banda.'

Hunt: A friend of David said he was angry that the police are not looking for another suspect in the 2012 incident

Barajas protested his innocence from the moment police accused him of murdering Banda as revenge for killing is boys.

He insisted he did not have time to run into his house, grab a gun and kill Banda before cops arrived at the scene.

Instead he says he begged passers-by to keep calling 911 as he performed CPS on his critically injured children.

Two teenagers and a school cook, who had stopped to help, reported hearing gun shots on the unlit rural road but couldn't identify the shooter.

In the 18 months it took before the case came to trial, relatives set up Facebook support pages for both Barajas and Banda.

Life-size cardboard cutouts of the dead children were paraded outside the court house and when the trial opened 25 members of Barajas' family and 20 plus of Banda's relatives filled the public benches.

Early on Judge Terri Holder ordered Barajas' relatives to remove buttons commemorating his two sons, fearing that would influence the jury.

'This is a difficult case for everyone involved. Everyone in here has lost someone they loved,' she told them.

Prosecutors claimed that Barajas, consumed by grief and fury, stormed into his home after the accident, grabbed a gun, then shot Banda out of revenge.

But they were hampered by the lack of physical evidence and the fact that security cameras at Barajas' home – that could have picked up his movements – were disabled.

Emotional: David told MailOnline: 'These people wrote letters to the District Attorney saying they wanted me to get a life sentence. I understand because they are hurt and I was found not guilty. They don't think that is fair'

Divided: The killings split the small Texas town in the 18-month lead up to the trial. Life-size cardboard cutouts of the dead children were paraded outside the court house and when the trial opened 25 members of Barajas' family and 20-plus of Banda's relatives filled the public benches

Abandoned: David said of not returning to their home, above: 'I fear that I could be outside one day cleaning up or something and they could come over and hurt me or my family'

Barajas high-profile attorney Sam Cammack picked the prosecution case apart, saying there was no gunshot residue on his client's hands, police had failed to prove the murder weapon belonged to him and no witnesses could identify the shooter.

It took the jury just three hours to acquit Barajas. He burst into tears as the not guilty verdict was read out.

After the case, Brazorio County District Attorney Jeri Yenne said they were not looking for any other suspects.
