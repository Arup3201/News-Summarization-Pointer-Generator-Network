A care home has been fined just £5,000 after a vulnerable pensioner died after suffering from severe burns when nurses lowered her into a scalding hot bath.

Former hospital matron Beatrice Morgan, 88, suffered the injuries while she was a resident at the Greencroft Care Home in Queensferry, Flintshire in August 2012.

It had been expected that Greencroft Care Ltd could have faced a fine in the region of £100,000 for breaching health and safety rules.

However, at Flintshire Magistrates Court on Thursday, the company was fined just £5,000 after the court heard how they had been in liquidation since last May.   

District Judge Gwyn Jones also said it was unlikely it would ever be collected.

Despite the sanction, owner Timothy Ogunleye, 52, who lives in a £1.6million home in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, and has combined assets of £5.7million, remains the director of seven other care homes which can house up to 336 residents. Two are being inspected by the care watchdog. 

Miss Morgan, from New Brighton near Mold, suffered from dementia and became a resident at the Greencroft Care Home, which specialised in care for the elderly.

In September 2012 she died from pneumonia and a blood clot in her lungs caused by the burns at a specialist burns unit at Whiston Hospital, a month after she was lowered into the scalding hot bath.

The court heard how the care home had no effective control over the temperature of the hot water at the home, no risk assessment had been carried out, and there had been little staff training.

Prosecutor Simon Parrington said Miss Morgan suffered scald burns to her lower legs, trunk and left arm.

After the incident thermostatic control mixer valves were fitted at the home.

The temperature of the water at the time of the incident was not known but tests on another bath which had not had the new values showed the temperature to be 50.7C.

Health and Safety Executive inspector Katherine Walker said that the maximum safe level was 44C.

An investigation also showed that there were old values present but they were behind wall panels, had not been maintained and the company did not know they were there.

A new value control had been placed on the bath in which Miss Morgan was scalded before she arrived to start her investigation, the inspector added.

Judge Jones said Miss Morgan was extremely vulnerable and frail and that the temperature of the bath was not controlled by a correctly adjusted thermostatic valve.

He added that it was 'a very, very basic requirement – in fact, a matter of common sense.'

He explained: 'The company either did not care for the safety of its residents or it could not be bothered to bring the standards of the home to a minimum standard which would have prevented the potential risks.

'Members of staff were doing their best in difficult circumstances, there was little staff training and little if any staff support.

'There was very little if any staff supervision and no risk assessment. Even the most basic risk assessment did not come until after she was scalded.'

The judge also added that there was no bathing policy and improvements had not been carried out because he said 'the company, to put it mildly, did not want to spend.'

He said: 'Company directors and senior managers know and ignored the risks.

'It is clear that this company was running an establishment without understanding their responsibilities.'

An inspection by the Care and Social Service Inspectorate for Wales raised serious concerns about the dignity and safety of the Greencroft home’s 26 residents, including poor staffing levels and training, cleanliness and security. It went to court to apply for the home’s immediate closure. 

Miss Morgan had never married and had been proud to work as a matron at the Wrexham Maelor Hospital in Wrexham, North Wales.  

After she retired, she continued to be active in her local community, where she was described as a feisty lady until she was 80.

Miss Morgan's nieces Ann Elliot and Susan Laws travelled from Kent for the hearing and said their aunt would have been shocked at her treatment given the way she had cared for so many people during her nursing career.

Mrs Elliot explained: 'It is shocking that she was scalded this way – it is such a basic caring procedure that everybody does every day.

'They said that they understood the way the judge had to deal with it because the company no longer existed.

'I hope it makes other care homes think of what they are doing. It was such a horrible way to spend her last days.'
