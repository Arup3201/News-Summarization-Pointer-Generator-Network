A campaigner is shining a light on the emotional, physical and sexual abuse young girls experience at the hands of their peers and campaigning for change.

Children as young as 11 are being groomed, bullied, beaten and raped by boys not much older than themselves and Carlene Firmin, 29, from north London says government policy does not protect them.

'We have a child protection system that is designed to look at risk in the home and assess a child there,' she argues. 'But in the files I’ve looked at, the primary risk - in terms of sexual abuse, physical assault and risk of offending - comes from their peer group.'

Victims of child-on-child sexual abuse tend to be between 11 and 13 
when it starts, perpetrators between 13 and 15, Firmin outlines to the Evening Standard.

She explains how young girls are victim to extreme sexual bullying upon joining secondary school and made to feel that in order to fit in, they must comply with the culture.

But why boys are motivated to rape their peers is 'quite complicated' - especially when they operate as a group.

For her research, the Metropolitan Police and the Crown Prosecution Service have given Carlene access to their files on violent cases among the young. She also talks to victims first hand.

'When someone trusts you with their story, you honour that trust,' says Carlene, who has worked with female victims attached to gangs since 2005.

The most harrowing tale she can recall comes from a 20-year-old whom she met in a refuge. The young woman, who can no longer have children due to her injuries, had two relationships with gang members as a teenager.

They broke her legs and collar bone,
beat and cut her with knives. They both raped and filmed her in front 
of their friends, and she was even 'sold' to clear a drugs debt.

The young woman thought her gang association would mean she wouldn't be taken seriously.

'She thought she'd brought it on herself
because she gained something from the relationships: her ex was giving 
her coke... She couldn't acknowledge she was a "worthy" victim,' says Carlene.

This young woman contributed her story to Carlene's nationwide research project, where she interviewed around 800 men and women from 2005 to 2008.

Her report eventually earned £1.2 million of government funding towards services that protect and work with young people at risk of gang-related and sexual violence. There are now 13 new posts around the country, largely thanks to Carlene's work.

To earn the trust of her interviewees, Carlene would need to make repeat visits to refuges, prisons and schools and give talks.

She was initially interviewing people on the impact of gangs, and sexual violence seemed to be the  hidden piece of the jigsaw.

When she put out a call for focus groups on young people and weapons, she was shocked when half the attendees were women.

She work tirelessly and listens to the most horrific stories, but says progress keeps her going

'They told us about being coerced to carry guns and knives, sexual violence and exploitation,' says Carlene.

'One girl told us, "They stop and search young men, but you can't stop and search for rape".'

Passionate for change, Carlene has achieved a staggering amount in her eight years, propelling issues surrounding young women, weapons and gang violence firmly onto the government's agenda and working on projects ensuring they are safer and their voices are being heard and taken seriously.

She witnessed the effects of gang violence first-hand in 2005 when six murders occurred in just seven months in her home town. It was this that inspired her to attempt to make changes on a national level.

'People in government making the decisions had no idea what it was like to live in an area like that, but I did,' Carlene says.

'Before my research there was nothing in government policy to deal with gang violence with women.'

But upon uncovering the full impact of violence on young women, she was sent to a UN conference to present her findings and later awarded an MBE.

'There are funds for violence against women, but not for 
this particular group... A 15-year-old girl who needs 
protection from 20 young men is in a very different situation. There 
were lots of issues not being addressed,' she says.

'We quickly had a significant impact.'

She launched the MsUnderstood Partnership on August to address gender inequality among the young, and last week advised the Office of the 
Children’s Commissioner after launching the highly-publicised national inquiry into sexual exploitation of girls by gangs.

'At the moment it's just me working with an intern and an advisory panel who assist. We want to secure more funding and hire three young women in the New Year,' she says.

Her next task is writing a PhD tackling child peer-on-peer abuse at Bedfordshire University.

'I'm lucky that we've seen significant 
changes in government policy. Securing change is what spurs me on, but 
so much more work needs doing...

'There's only so much MsUnderstood can do. We need to not be needed, and for the work to be delivered without me there. I want a national strategy to tackle the issue.'
