The massive wildfire still raging in the California wilderness may have been sparked by a illegal marijuana farm.

During a press conference Friday, Todd McNeal, chief of Northern California's Twain Harte Fire Department, said that they now know that the fire was 'human caused' as there wasn't any lightening in the area when the fire started August 17.

While they don't know what for sure started the fire, McNeal said that they 'highly suspect that it might have been some sort of illicit grove, marijuana-grow type of thing.'

Origins: Experts say that the Rim Fire in Northern California may have been started at an illegal marijuana farm

The place where the fire started was practically unreachable by foot. The only way to access the area was by plane or a challenging hike.

The fire is still under investigation by the U.S. Forest Service.

A spokesman said there has been progress in the case, but is not sharing further details at this time.

As of Friday, firefighters announced that they had contained 35 per cent of the blaze, and plan to have it fully under control by September 20.

The fire started in a remote area of the Stanislaus National Forest near Jawbone Ridge on August 17.

Battle: As of Friday the fire is still only 35 per cent contained. Firefighters hope to get it fully contained by September 20

At one point the fire grew to the size of Chicago, and smoke from the flames have spread thousands of miles away to Canada and the Great Lakes with traces of the smoke showing up in Europe as well.

The fire has destroyed an estimated 213,414 acres which makes it the fifth larges wildfire in California history. 

It has destroyed hundreds of buildings as well as threatened giant sequoias and San Francisco's power and drinking water.

Historic proportions: So far the blaze has destroyed more than 200 thousand acres, making it the fifth largest wildfire in California history

This wouldn't be the first wildfire started by an illegal grow operation.

In 2009, a campfire at an illegal farm run by a Mexican drug cartel near Santa Barbara started a fire that burned 90,000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest.

After the blaze, authorities found 30,000 marijuana plants and an AK-47 near the area where the wildfire started.

The Santa Barbara County sheriff announced after that wildfire that many Mexican drug cartels were moving their grow operations across the border into California since the tightening of security at the U.S.-Mexico border.

'It's made it much more difficult for the cartels to smuggle into the country, particularly marijuana around the U.S.- Mexico border, which is large and bulky,' Sheriff Bill Brown said. 'It's easier to grow it here.'

According to a political leader in the are where the current wildfire is raging, drug cartels have been a problem in the Stanislaus National Forest.

'We know that these illegal pot growers are in out forests and I think this fire just wiped out a whole bunch of them,' Randy Hanvelt, chairman of the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors told the San Jose Mercury News.

'It's a problem in all the Sierra forests. When we find them, we pull out like 20,000 plants at a time,' he said.

He describes the place where the fire started as 'tough' to get to.

'You don't get there by accident,' Mr Hanvelt said.
