Michael Carrick believes Juan Mata has always been an important player for Manchester United after the playmaker's double helped the Red Devils to a 2-1 win over Liverpool on Sunday. 

The little Spaniard has struggled to hold down a first-team place recently but teammate Michael Carrick was not surprised to see his match-winning performance.

‘Listen, all players have ups and downs throughout their careers,’ said Carrick. ‘You can’t look past his quality; that is why he is here and he is here for a reason. He is such a good player and performances like that don’t surprise me because performances like that are exactly what he is all about.

‘He has always been a great player. I think he has always been important to us because he brings so much to the team, and so much ability.

‘You have seen it all there on Sunday, in terms of what he brings to us and I thought he was terrific. I thought his overall play was good and he obviously scored both goals. I thought the first one was a really good finish and the second one was sensational, so he has had a good day.

‘He is just so clever, you know. He moves the ball, takes up good positions, he is dangerous and he is just so intelligent. He has such a slight frame so he is not going to have a physical presence but he more than makes up for that with his general ability and how he plays the game. He is just a joy to watch.’

Carrick was not surprised by Mata's match-winning performance and thought the Spaniard was 'terrific' 

United had Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao among their substitutes at Anfield, and Carrick believes that demonstrates the depth of resources available to Van Gaal. He believes the Dutchman could pick two completely different line-ups capable of competing at the highest level, with little to choose between the players in training games.

‘I think it tells you about the squad and the strength in depth,’ said Carrick. ‘What more can you say? Listen, those boys (Di Maria and Falcao) are top players but I think we have got a number of players that the manager can choose from, which is great.

‘We see in training when we have games that both teams are pretty equal, when we have 11 versus 11, because that is the strength of our squad now. A lot of players have had game time this year and that does bring options.’
