This astonishing time-lapse video released by  NASA shows just how Superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc across the US East Coast.

The superstorm's path was predicted almost exactly by the National Hurricane Center - and this accurate forecast was critical to ensuring authorities knew which direction it would take.

The centre, based in Miami, Florida, had an average error in its track forecast three days into the future for Sandy of just 71 miles, which dropped to only 48 miles within two days of it hitting.

First-look: Sandy is seen over the Caribbean on October 25 at 06:40 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)

Moving along: Sandy is seen last Sunday (October 28) at 17:32 UTC, just before it struck the US East Coast

Devastation: Sandy hit the US East Coast last Monday (October 29) and it is pictured here at 15:45 UTC

Destruction: Sandy passes over New Jersey and causes huge damage on Tuesday (October 30) at 03:55 UTC

Leaving: Sandy begins to leave the US on Wednesday (October 31) at 11:45 UTC after causing destruction

This is compared to an average error of 518 miles in 1970, 345 miles in 1990 and 138 miles from 2007 to 2011. The average in the past five years was 96 miles, reported the Washington Post.

The NHC correctly predicted by last Thursday morning that southern New Jersey would be near the centre of Sandy’s track forecast - around 108 hours before it hit land.

Andrew Freedman of research group Climate Central said that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration figures show track forecasts have improved by 50 per cent over the past 15 years.

He added: ‘During the period from 2003 to 2008, the average storm track forecast had an error that was down to less than 200 miles at 72 hours, and less than 100 miles at 48 hours.’

But the five-day forecast error margin for Hurricane Isaac, which hit Louisiana in August, was 253 miles - above the modern-day average of 245 - although it was only 70 miles out with 48 hours to go.

And storm intensity forecasts have not progressed like track forecasts over recent years, because computer models still have problems capturing small-scale details such as air mass characteristics.

Sandy was blamed for at least 98 deaths in the US and Canada, and left New Jersey's barrier islands a wasteland of eroded shoreline, ruined beachfront homes, flooded streets and damaged utilities.

As New York City came back to life yesterday, starting with the partial reopening of subway routes three days after the storm, it was revealed the total U.S. damage could hit $50billion (£31billion).

This would make it the second-costliest storm in US history after Hurricane Katrina. Warnings also rose again over global warming and the prospect of more similar severe weather to come.
