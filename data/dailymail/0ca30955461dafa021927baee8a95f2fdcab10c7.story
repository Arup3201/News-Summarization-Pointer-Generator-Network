David Luiz says he is leaving Chelsea with 'great sadness' after passing his medical and agreeing terms with Paris Saint-Germain ahead of his £50million transfer.

The 27-year-old is set to become the world's most expensive defender, with the move beating the two previous highest fees - both paid by PSG, for Marquinhos and Thiago Silva.

PSG representatives flew out to Brazil to complete the medical at the World Cup hosts' training base on Friday.

Sportsmail's Lee Clayton and Alex Kay visited David Luiz's home in February 2013 to interview the Chelsea star and QPR goalkeeper Julio Cesar ahead of the England v Brazil friendly at Wembley.

Chelsea confirmed the deal on the club’s website on Friday night before Luiz issued a statement expressing his sadness at leaving the Stamford Bridge outfit after almost four years.

‘Thanks Chelsea for the three and half years of great partnership,’ Luiz said. ‘I've made good friends, won many titles and those memories will last with me for ever.

‘I'd like to thank my team mates, all staff and all supporters (my geezers).

‘I'm leaving with great sadness but at the same time excited for the new challenge that lies ahead in this great club in a city that have always enchanted me.

‘It's a new stage, new challenge and together we will go even further. Allez Paris!’

PSG believe they are capturing one of the most stylish defensive players in the world and they are flexing their financial muscle again in what will be the first major transfer of a busy World Cup summer.

The previous best deal received by an English club for a defender was when Rio Ferdinand left Leeds for Manchester United for £30m 12 years ago. This deal will dwarf that British record transfer.Sources in Paris have confirmed PSG had to move quickly to beat Barcelona and Bayern Munich which may explain the size of the fee they were prepared to pay.

Chelsea will use the money to rebuild their squad next season, with Diego Costa top of their wishlist. Their decision to sell comes quickly after John Terry agreed a new contract. Terry will play alongside Gary Cahill next season.

Luiz will play at centre half for Brazil in the World Cup but he can also play as a holding midfielder.
