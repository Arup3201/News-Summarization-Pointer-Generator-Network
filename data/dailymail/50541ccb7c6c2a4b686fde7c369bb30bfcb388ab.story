A mother has won a restraining order against her 'childish' next-door neighbour after a bitter 18-month dispute over wheelie bins culminated in him being arrested for allegedly attacking her.

Joanne Dowling, 42, of Aberdare, south Wales, became locked in a bin battle with neighbour Gary Jones, 58, after claiming he blocked her parking space with his garbage.

Heated words escalated after Jones smeared grease over Ms Dowling's bin handles before later allegedly lunging at her in her own home.

Garbage wars: Trainee solicitor Joanne Dowling, 42, of Aberdare, south Wales, became embroiled in a bitter dispute with next-door neighbour Gary Jones (R), 58, over their wheelie bins

According to trainee solicitor Ms Dowling, she had initially politely requested her next-door neighbour refrain from leaving his rubbish in front of her property.

After tensions mounted between the pair, Jones began to coat the handles of her wheelie bins with thick grease, preventing her from opening the lid to dispose of her garbage on collection days.

The extraordinary row came to a head when Ms Dowling opened her bin one day and found it was full of her neighbour's rubbish.

Jones and his family had filled it with leftover party decorations and half a birthday cake and when Ms Dowling found it, she flung it on to her neighbour's doorstep in anger. 

She was then confronted by her neighbour's screaming daughters and later, a furious Jones banged on her door and allegedly lunged at her when she opened it, pushing her on to her sofa.

The father was arrested and ordered to appear in court - where he was banned from having any contact with Ms Dowling for three years.

Ms Dowling said: 'Every day when I got home from work the neighbours would have deliberately obstructed my parking spot with their bin.

'We live on a very narrow street so everyone keeps their wheelie bin tight to the front of their house but for some reason next door liked to keep their bin on my side.

'They objected to me moving it out of the way and started to smear builders grease on the handle so I wouldn't touch it.

'They also wrote signs warning me not to touch their bin. It was so childish.'

When she attempted to move the bin out of the way her neighbours claimed she was tampering with their property. 

Describing the birthday cake incident, she added: 'I'd had enough by this point so I grabbed the cake out of the bin and plonked it on the neighbour's door step.

'But the next thing I knew Gary's daughters were out of the house and screaming at me.

'I couldn't believe there was so much grief coming my way over our bins so I went home.'

The next day Jones, 58 knocked on her front door. 

She anticipated that he was calling by to apologise and opened the door to greet him but he lunged at her - shouting and swearing.

She said: 'I opened the door and he burst in and grabbed me by the top. He yelled and swore at me and shoved me onto the sofa.

'Luckily my boyfriend was home and he's a big bloke - there's no way Gary would have argued with him.'

Following the altercation Ms Dowling called the police and Jones was charged with a public order offence.

Restraining order: The mother had Jones arrested after he allegedly attacked her in her own home, grabbing her by the top and pushing her on to a sofa

At Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court he was given a fine of £360 plus a ten-week community order.

He was also made the subject of a three-year restraining order not to contact Ms Dowling, her partner or children, and not to attend her property.

Gareth Walters, defending, said that what had started as a 'petty dispute' between two neighbours had led to an 'out-of-control' situation.
