Steven Gerrard has admitted there will be nowhere to hide if England crash out of the World Cup after only two games.

Roy Hodgson’s team will be eliminated if they are beaten by Uruguay on Thursday night and Costa Rica draw with Italy in Recife on Friday. The game could come down to a shoot-out between strikers Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez — team-mates at Liverpool, but deadly rivals this evening.

England captain Gerrard said: ‘It could be a terrible, long, frustrating summer if we don’t get it right.

‘You go home earlier than you expect and it can be tough as a player. It can take an awful long time to get over it.

'The lads still have that confidence and belief. I haven’t seen any negativity or anyone lacking any belief since the Italy game. I just sensed a bit of frustration the day after, but we put it to bed reasonably quickly.

'We held a meeting and it wasn’t to scare anyone or intimidate anyone but that is the reality of where we are. We need everyone focused and right on it to perform individually and collectively.

‘The mood has come back to the way it was before the Italy game, which is important. We have a must-win scenario.

‘It was important for a few young lads to know what’s at stake and how important this game is. We all need to leave everything on that pitch.’

Gerrard will put his friendship with Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez to one side before Thursday night's clash.

Gerrard added: ‘I will say hello and 
shake his hand but at that moment I am not looking for friends. He knows
 once that whistle blows there is no friendship between us for 90 
minutes.

‘Of course we have had banter up to this point.
 It has to remain private, but he is a very confident guy. He plays in 
our country and this match means an awful lot to him and he is desperate
 to win it.’

Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez was cautious over Suarez, saying: ‘We must consider the possibility he’s not as well as he was during the Premier League.’

And Gerrard added: ‘They are in the same situation as us, maybe a worse situation.

‘It is set up perfectly for a fantastic match. There is a lot at stake.’
