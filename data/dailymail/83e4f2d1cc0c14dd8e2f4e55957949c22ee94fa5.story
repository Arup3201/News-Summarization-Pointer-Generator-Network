English football agents are to take legal action against the FA unless a compromise can be reached over the introduction of ‘unworkable’ new regulations next month.

The Association of Football Agents agreed unanimously this week to injunct the FA to prevent them from bringing in ‘unacceptable’ rules from April 1 - after FIFA washed their hands of responsibility for managing the middle men, passing the buck to the national associations.

The AFA have engaged the QC and sports law expert Lord Pannick to fight their corner - with the threat of an injunction hovering over a summit with the FA called to resolve the issue.

The agents object to the way the FA intend to administer their lucrative work. This includes a reduction in fees, no pay for representing players under 18 and a free-for-all with no agent’s licence required in future.

Mel Stein, chairman of the AFA, said: ‘There is no doubt that the upcoming regulations are unworkable and it will be an horrendous mess unless some agreement can be reached. At least finalising a meeting is some kind of progress.’

The FA, who are understood to have chosen the successor to general secretary Alex Horne, were certainly aiming high with their original wish list. 

It is understood to have included Formula One Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who is said to have been asked whether he was interested in leaving his £6million-a-year job in motor racing to earn 10 times less at Wembley. You can imagine his quick answer.

Former British No 1 tennis player Buster Mottram, better known for his extreme right-wing political views, has been barred from membership of the All England Club for six weeks.

Mottram, 59, who plays regular social tennis at Wimbledon when not involved in games of bridge, refused to comment on the reasons for his suspension.

The secretive club, who don’t like talking about their internal business even when staging the Wimbledon Championships, also refused to discuss his misdemeanour.

The Welsh FA have expressed anger with the FA over their plans to field Team GB football teams at the Rio Olympics without consultation. 

Welsh FA president Trevor Lloyd-Hughes said he was ‘livid and absolutely gutted with the English FA’, while Wales chief executive Jonathan Ford wants to be involved in all decision-making around 2016, having been given the impression that participation in the 2012 London Games was going to be a one-off. 

The FA say they have asked the three other home nations where they stand.

DYKE COACHING ROW

There is a major split developing within the FA over chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission proposals to fund coaching development at the expense of cuts across the board.

Dyke’s initiative, with £2.7million per year being switched from other parts of the FA budget to pay for 35 new coach educators to work in the grassroots (24) and professional game (11), has been approved by the FA board.

But amateur blazers have yet to be convinced about the merits of such expenditure and the resulting 15 per cent cuts being imposed on every department to raise the cash.

National game chairman Roger Burden has written to councillors to inform them of their colleagues’ concern about the lack of consultation and their fears that the proposed reduction in FA Trophy and FA Vase prize-money may have a ‘devastating effect’ on some smaller clubs who rely on this money to stay afloat.

An FA spokesman said the national game had four representatives on the FA board that has approved the proposal and it was up to individual departments where they made cuts.

England cricket chiefs Paul Downton and Peter Moores, having presided over abject preparation, performances and team selection at the World Cup, are fortunate the new ECB hierarchy had such low expectations. 

The high command are also busy with restructuring the organisation, so axeing the team leadership pair is not on their agenda. This probably means Downton and Moores will have this summer’s Ashes series to secure their jobs.
