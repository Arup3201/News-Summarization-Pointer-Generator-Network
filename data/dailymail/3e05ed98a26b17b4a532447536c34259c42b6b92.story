Individual: Ajax Player of the Year (2012/13), Dutch Footballer of the Year (2014)

Blind, valued at £17.4million, has been identified as a player that Van Gaal wants at Old Trafford ahead of his debut Premier League season.

His ability to play at left back or as a defensive midfielder makes him good cover for summer signing Luke Shaw as Patrice Evra prepares to join Juventus.

Michael Carrick's injury may have added incentive, too.

The 32-year-old midfielder, who was high on Van Gaal's shortlist to be the next United captain, was ruled out for 12 weeks with an ankle injury.

Ajax manager Frank de Boar, though, hopes to keep Blind, but admits every player has his price.

'Personally, I don't think so,' when asked by AT5 if Blind would be sold.

'Everyone is obviously for sale, but we feel that those three players, the World Cup players (Blind, Jasper Cillessen and Joel Veltman), with a few guys in the current squad, should be the water carriers of this squad.'
