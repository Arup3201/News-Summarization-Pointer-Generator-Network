Bank customers and staff in Moore, Oklahoma survived the devastating tornado on Monday after taking refuge in the secure vault.

Amazing photographs taken after the two mile-wide storm, which damaged 2,400 homes and left 24 people dead, show how the vault is the only part of the Tinker Federal Credit Union still standing.

Among the stacks of cash and other precious goods, 14 bank employees and eight customers hid during the storm and walked away entirely unharmed, the bank wrote on its website.

Unharmed: A photo taken by one of the customers shows the moment they left the vault unscathed

The harrowing picture of the vault among the ruins was posted on the branch's Facebook page, and many customers and employees have been leaving compliments for the quick-thinking staff.

'I was one of the members in the vault yesterday,' Dena Clark wrote. 'You all should be so proud of your employees! Everyone, especially Jan the branch manager, acted so heroically to keep everyone safe. I am so thankful! Our family loves TFCU!'

Mrs Clark also uploaded pictures of the aftermath to her Facebook page, showing children and elderly people being helped from the vault by emergency responders.

'I was in the Tinker Federal Credit Union vault, Moore location and the building was completely leveled,' Warren Dempsey added. 'I had to climb out through the building debris.'

Another Oklahoma resident, Aaron 
Clarke, also shared an image on Twitter of people leaving the vault 
after the storm, explaining that his mother was an employee who had hid 
there.

Despite the devastation outside the 
vault, the customers and staff were unharmed - and Clarke's photograph 
even shows one woman clutching the beverage she'd taken inside.

'Crazy to think the Moore branch is completely leveled.,' former employee Christopher T. Craig wrote. 'Spent plenty of Saturdays there when I worked for TFCU. So glad everyone made it through safely.'

A side-by-side comparison 
of the exterior of the bank before and after the EF-5 storm shows that 
the reinforcements used in the vault was really all that kept the nearly
 two dozen survivors safe.

The bank is using their Facebook page as a way to communicate with their customers, both about their business and the safety of their staff.

Everything in it's path: Entire neighborhoods in Moore were leveled

The administrator wrote that all of 
the branch employees - both those who were in the building when the 
storm hit shortly after 3pm and those who were not at work at the time -
 were safe.

'Sadly, 26 of their homes were damaged, four of those were completely destroyed,' the update read.

They made a more logistical notification, saying that customers don't have to fear lost or damaged data as all of their transactions are stored in the Tinker Federal Credit Union data system which is not kept on site. They added that all deposit boxes also remained in tact.

The bank is just one of many using social media to help keep the residents of the Oklahoma City suburbs informed and connected as they deal with the process of rebuilding their lives.

Fragments of photos and family momentos 
were sent all over Oklahoma state following the storms on Sunday and 
Monday, and now a crew of concerned residents are trying to get them 
back to their rightful owners.
