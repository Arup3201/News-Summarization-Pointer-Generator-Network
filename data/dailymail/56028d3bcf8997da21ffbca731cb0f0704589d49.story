Perhaps the most telling thing about Mark Robins’ departure from Huddersfield after just 18 months as their manager, and just one game into the new season, was that it was not a surprise.

The tale is one typical of the Championship in recent years.

Incredibly, Steve Evans is the longest-serving manager in the division having been at newly-promoted Rotherham for two years and 124 days. That, in times gone by - even recent times - would be considered barely a bedding in period.

Telling: Mark Robins departed the managerial post at Huddersfield after just one game of the new season

Servant: Rotherham boss Steve Evans is the longest-serving Championship manager at 2 years, 124 days

Steve Evans - Rotherham: 2 years, 124 days

Lee Clark - Birmingham: 2 years, 46 days

Eddie Howe - Bournemouth: 1 year, 302 days

Dougie Freedman - Bolton: 1 years, 292 days

Mick McCarthy - Ipswich: 1 year, 283 days

Yet there are 22 clubs in the second tier with managers who have been in their posts for less than two years - and that was the case even before Robins was sacked.

The only other manager to have been in his job for over two years, Lee Clark, is on thin ice at Birmingham having kept them up only in the dying seconds of last season, and following an abject defeat at Middlesbrough at the weekend.

Evans is only 19th on the list of the longest-serving managers in England’s top four divisions. Ahead of him are four from the Premier League, eight from League One and six from League Two.

And, let’s not forget, the Rotherham boss was a League One manager until three months ago.

Championship waters are the most treacherous for managers in England, and it’s no coincidence.

Relegated teams arrive with the intention of getting straight back up to the Premier League and increasingly, with foreign investment dripping down in to the lower leagues, teams promoted from League One have the same ambition.

In Leagues One and Two, there are plenty of clubs and fans just happy to maintain their Football League status, just as in the Premier League where the majority are content with staying put.

Runner up: Birmingham boss Lee Clark is second on the list at 2 years, 46 days

But if you are just happy to be in the Championship, as Yeovil were last season, you’ll come straight back down.

Yeovil manager Gary Johnson, ironically, would be the longest-serving manager in the Championship had his side stayed up - maybe those trigger-happy owners have a point after all.

It is its volatility that makes the Championship so exciting, just maybe not for the managers.

Three is the magic number

The Premier League season may not have started yet but Louis van Gaal has already had an effect on English football.

The Dutchman’s use of a 3-5-2 formation at the World Cup - where the system was also used successfully by Costa Rica, Chile and Mexico - inspired several managers to try it out on the Football League’s opening weekend.

Watford have used the system for the past two seasons in the Championship under Giuseppe Sannino and Gianfranco Zola, and League Two Exeter’s long-serving boss Paul Tisdale has regularly used three at the back over his lengthy tenure in Devon.

But it is in League One where the Van Gaal effect seems to have really taken hold, with Bristol City, Coventry and Swindon all trying the formation which worked so well in Brazil.

Bristol City shocked Sheffield United 2-1 at Bramall Lane, Swindon - fielding a side with an average age of just 21 - were very impressive in beating Scunthorpe 3-1, while Coventry performed well despite going down 3-2 at Bradford.

Expect to see more teams try it out as the season goes on.

Talent scout: Igor Vetokele (Charlton)

It has been a turbulent 2014 so far for Charlton, but their 1-1 draw at Brentford on Saturday provided hope for the future, not least the performance of 22-year-old striker Vetokele.

The Belgium-born Angolan international who arrived from FC Copenhagen was a powerful threat all day long at Griffin Park, and scored the opening with a header from a corner.

Promising: Charlton's 22-year-old forward Igor Vetokele looks a useful addition for the Addicks

However, while his performance will have delighted boss Bob Peeters, too many more like that and parent club Standard Liege could come calling in January.
