White House hopeful Ted Cruz says he's already received more than $1 million in donations since his Tuesday announcement that he would run for president.

The Republican lawmaker made the disclosure during a Tuesday evening interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly after she read aloud several not-so-rave reviews of his candidacy.

'If you want a quick indication of the support we're seeing - the incredible grassroots support - it's been 36 hours since we launched the campaign. In the first day, over 140,000 people have come to our website TedCruz.org,' the Texas senator said.

'In the first day we've raised over $1 million,' he continued. 'In one day.'

A Politico report from Tuesday that said the freshman senator had raised just $500,000 was using an outdated number, Cruz contended, and the amount of  money his campaign has raised now tops $1 million.

Noting that he's not the favorite candidate of lobbyists in Washington, D.C. and 'crony capitalists,' Cruz said the ground swell was coming from grassroots supporters.

'Our campaign is based on courageous conservatives across this country, men and women goin' to TedCruz.org and contributing. And that's where we're getting the support,' he told Kelly.

Cruz formally announced his entry into the 2016 contest for White House on Monday morning before a crowd of 10,000 at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.

In making himself an official candidate for higher office Cruz also made himself a target for criticisms from the media and fellow competitors for the Republican nomination, namely Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.

Paul, who plans to make his own announcement in less than two weeks on April 7, insinuated in a Monday interview with Kelly that Cruz is too divisive to attract the kind of support the GOP needs to claim victory in the 2016 general election.

The freshman lawmaker argued in plain terms that Tea Party Republicans would be better off selecting him as the party's nominee over Cruz and other conservatives because unlike them he's earned the respect of minorities and other urban community dwellers.

Cruz said Tuesday during an early-morning appearance on the Today show that he was confident in his ability to put back together the broad national coalition of women, young people and moderate Democrats that swept Ronald Reagan into power in 1980.

He hammered his point home to Kelly during his Tuesday evening appearance on his Fox News program, The Kelly File.

'I like Rand Paul, he's a friend of mine, I respect him, we fought side by side for liberty, we'll keep fighting side by side for liberty,' he said of his colleague, before shifting gears and explaining that in running for statewide office 'we reassembled the Reagan coalition' and that was how he won his 2012 Senate race.

Cruz also sought during the interview to put some daylight between his background and that of President Barack Obama, elected to the Oval Office after spending just two years in the Senate.

In addition to their limited experience with federal lawmaking, both men are Harvard educated lawyers. 

Arguing that there are 'marked differences' between he and the current president, including the fact that he served as his state's chief lawyer and successfully argued cases before the Supreme Court before running for and being elected to the federal legislature. 

Obama worked as a community organizer, he said, ignoring the former Illinois lawmaker's time as a state senator preceding his time as U.S. Senator.

Furthermore, Cruz claimed that Obama was a backbencher in the Senate, whereas he has been a leading voice on issues of national importance.

'In my time in the Senate, there were a lot of faults I have, but nobody would accuse me of being a backbencher,' the outspoken conservative legislator said.

As for the fruits of his labor, Cruz said, 'What we’ve accomplished over and over again, in many instances, is stopping bad things from happening.' 

He pointed to legislation introduced in the Senate in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting and said, 'I did everything I could to energize and mobilize the grassroots to stand up and protect the Second Amendment. 

'And every single proposal of Barack Obama to undermine the Second Amendment was voted down on the Senate floor,' he stated.

Asked 'what do you like best about yourself that makes you think you could hold this job, Cruz's answer was simple: 'I love the Constitution, and I am fighting for freedom.'

'I wake up every day, I jump out of bed, I cannot tell you how thrilled I am, because this country is in crisis, and what an incredible privilege to be in the arena,' he told her.
