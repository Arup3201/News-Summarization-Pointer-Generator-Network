With their lithe golden legs, perfect figures and stunning looks, the Victoria's Secret models are girls that most of us would love to resemble.

But although mimicking the girls' gazelle-like limbs and towering height might not be within reach of most of us, you can at least get the Victoria's Secret make-up look thanks to a new online tutorial.

The video, which stars top British make-up artist, Polly Osmond, and Victoria's Secret Angel Erin Heatherton shows you how to get what the company describes as 'the modern Italian bombshell' look.

Not surprisingly, the products used to create it all come from the Victoria's Secret make-up range but the tips can be used by anyone in possession of some bronze eye shadow, a kohl pencil and a pot of rosy pink blusher.

'Dolce Vita is all about being sexy so start the look with the black pencil,' explains Osmond. 'Work it into the eyelid. You don't have to be precise at this moment - this is just to get the shape.'

Next, she continues, wing it out then work it into the inner corner of the eye and underneath as well. Follow by smudging the liner to create a classic smoky eye.

'Finish off the eye using the Eye Quad in Bellissima,' adds Osmond. 'I'm not using the green, just the bronze tones. Use the base colour just in the inner corner, blending it outwards.Then go over the eyeliner a little bit at a time and then working it into the eyelid. This look is all about blending so no hard lines.'

Osmond then goes on to give Heatherton a suitably supermodel-esque glow, dusting highlighter across the model's cheekbones and dabbing a little onto the cupid's bow.

Despite being just 24, model Erin Hetherton is a Victoria's Secret veteran and has been an Angel since 2008

'Then,' she concludes, 'I'm going to use a tiny bit of the 
bronzer just to give a little bit of contour and then a little bit of 
the blush just to give some colour to the cheeks.'

One of the UK's top make-up artists, Osmond’s career has seen her work for a veritable who's who of fashion photography, including Miles Aldridge, Patrick Demarchelier and Annie Leibovitz.

Along with her work for Victoria's Secret, Polly has also created make-up looks for designer brands such as Armani, Calvin Klein, Chanel, Clinique and Lancome.'

24-year-old Heatherton, meanwhile, has made a name for herself on the catwalk at Diane von Fürstenberg, Shiatzy Chen, Oscar de la Renta and Tommy Hilfiger among others.

Despite her youth, the American model is a Victoria's Secret veteran and has worked with the brand since 2008.
