Dramatic footage of a Costa Concordia crew member telling passengers to 'Go back to your cabins' has emerged.

The plea came despite the luxury liner being fatally holed and underlines the chaotic situation in the moments after the ship struck rocks.

Holidaymakers wearing red life jackets can be seen milling on the deck of the Concordia in the mobile phone footage which was posted on Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera's website.

Emergence of the footage came as a cook from the ship said Captain Francesco Schettino had ordered dinner at 10.30pm - nearly an hour after the liner struck rocks at 9.41pm.

Questions have already been raised as to the slow response from captain Francesco Schettino in waiting more than an hour to abandon the stricken 290m Concordia.

And the footage confirms passenger accounts of how they were told to return to their cabins sending some of the victims to certain death.

The film also again underlines how Schettino and his crew were still insisting that the situation was all down to a 'electrical black out'.

But by then he knew that the ship had suffered a 70m gash in its hull after hitting a reef off the coast of the Italian island of Giglio as he sailed past too close in a mad moment of showing off.

Further light has been shed on what happened to the youngest person still missing from the doomed Costa Concordia.

Dyana Arlotti, five, and her father William have not been accounted for since the ship ran aground last Friday.

But a children's entertainer has revealed the Rimini girl was part of a group of eight youngsters he took charge of after they were separated from their parents in the chaos.

John Lazzarini, who was at the time dressed as Spiderman, shepherded them to a quiet corner, organised them into a chain and led them hand in hand to the deck.

He told the Telegraph: 'We heard the signal to abandon ship. We went down to Deck 4, the pickup area, where I divided them up according to which muster station they belonged to and helped them find their parents.'

But some of the children, including Dyana, whose mother (top right) was pictured on Giglio yesterday, became lost in the chaos.

The female crew member is seen telling 
passengers in Italian: 'The situation is under control. Go back to your 
cabins. We ask you that you all return to your cabins.

'Once the electrical problem is sorted out everything will be back to normal shortly. Everything is under control. We are resolving the problem.'

However, just 30 minutes after the video was shot cowardly captain Schettino eventually gave the order to abandon ship.

But by then it was too late as the ship had begun to list too far over for the lifeboats to be launched safely and passengers had to make their way down the superstructure of the hull using rope ladders.

This morning the search was called 
off after movement was detected by lasers pointed onto the ship and it 
was deemed too dangerous for the dive teams to carry on the hunt.

There
are still 21 people still missing, who are believed to be lying in 
muster stations on decks submerged below the water.

A total of 11 people
have been confirmed dead.

The
main concern for teams working on the ship is the weather, as although 
they have been lucky in the week following the tragedy the forecast is 
for strong winds.

The ceremony of the 'salute' (inchino) - where captains sail dangerously close to shore - appears to be widespread among captains of Italian cruiseships.

TradeWinds publication reported 'it has become frequent in Italy to be dazzled by the sight of one of Costa's giant ships blaring its horns a few hundred metres from shore'.

Italian environment minister Corrado Clini spoke out about the manoeuvre, and made it clear it will no longer be tolerated.

The fear 
is that it could whip up waves around the Concordia and shift it further
- even possibly dislodging it from the rock shelf it is resting on.

Fire brigade spokesman Luca Cari said: 'The search was suspended at around midnight because movement was detected.

'It was thought best to pull the dive teams out and we are now deciding the best course of action.'

The
revelation that Schettino had ordered dinner at 10.30pm - less than an 
hour after the liner struck rocks at 9.41pm - was made by ship's cook 
Rogelio Barista.

He told Filipino TV station GMA: 'We wondered what was going on. 'At that time, we really felt something was wrong.

'The
stuff in the kitchen was falling off shelves and we realised how grave 
the situation was. I have had 12 years of experience as a cook on a 
cruise ship.

'I have even witnessed fires, so I wasn't that scared. But I did wonder, though, what the captain was doing. Why was he still there?'

Investigators
are looking into the role played by the owner of the Costa Concordia as
the order to abandon ship was delayed by 68 minutes.

They
are looking in particular at the requirement that, once the order is 
given, each passenger is entitled to  €10,000 euros in compulsory 
compensation.

It would mean a  €30million bill for the 3,000 tourists. Costa Cruises declined to comment on the compensation allegations.

But
it has labelled itself as an 'aggrieved party' in what could be one of 
the biggest maritime claims in history. It has also suspended Captain 
Francesco Schettino.

Prosecutor Francesco Verusio has also said that the only suspects were Captain Schettino and the Second Officer Ciro Ambrosio.

Suspension of the search comes after it was revealed Moldovan ballerina Domnica Cemortan, 25, was seen cavorting with Schettino on the bridge of the ship in the minutes before his cruise liner foundered on rocks.

Italian authorities believe Schettino - dubbed Captain Coward - may have been distracted from his command by trying to impress the dancer who they now consider to be a 'key witness'.

Miss Cemortan, who has a two-year-old daughter, had worked as a translator for the Concordia but was on holiday on the ship at the time of Friday night’s disaster.

She has now defended the captain, who she told Moldovan TV had 'saved over 3,000 lives'.

She also said she was summoned to the bridge to help translate for the evacuation of Russian passengers.

Prosecutor Francesco Verusio declined to comment on Italian media reports that Ms Cemortan was being sought as a witness.

Schettino is under house arrest and faces 
possible charges of manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing a 
shipwreck.

He admitted he made an unauthorised detour from the programmed route
that caused the vessel to slam into a reef and capsize off the Tuscan 
island of Giglio.

Hard at work: The ship is at risk of completely sinking in the next few hours

Yesterday an audiotape of the doomed vessel's first communications with maritime authorities showed the ship's officers continued to report only an electrical problem for more than 30 minutes after hitting the reef.

Seven of the 11 dead were also identified yesterday by authorities - four French passengers, one Spanish and one Italian passenger and one Peruvian crew member. Italian passenger Giovanni Masia, who would have been 86 next week, was buried in Sardinia.

Italian authorities have identified 32 people who have either died or are missing: two Americans, 12 Germans, seven Italians, six French, two Peruvians and one person each from Hungary, India and Spain.
