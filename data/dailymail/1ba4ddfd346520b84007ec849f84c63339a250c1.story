Two students fell 60ft to their deaths while ‘making out’ on the balcony of a luxury apartment, an inquest heard yesterday.

Anastasia Tutik, 19, and Miguel Ramos, 18, were kissing and cuddling when they lost their balance and plunged from the sixth-floor ledge.

The pair, who had both been drinking, had met earlier that evening at a friend’s party in the flat in Deptford, south-east London, which has spectacular views of the Thames and Canary Wharf.

Dangerous: A neighbour said she saw the couple entwined on the ledge of the flat's balcony (circled)

Miss Tutik was seen sitting on the railing with her legs wrapped around Mr Ramos in the moments before they fell.

Coroner Dr Andrew Harris described their deaths as a ‘tragic accident’ during the inquest at Southwark Coroner’s Court. ‘There is nothing from any witness statement that indicates they intended to take their lives,’ he said.

‘They were happy students celebrating the end of term.’

Dr Harris said his thoughts were with the families of both teenagers, who ‘have to celebrate Christmas without their young people’. 

The pair died from multiple injuries. Dr Harris recorded a verdict of accidental death in which alcohol was a contributing factor. 

Miss Tutik came to the UK from Russia in September last year and was studying for her A-levels at Bellerbys College.

Mr Ramos, from Monterrey in Mexico, was taking a summer course at nearby English language school Embassy and had been in the UK for only a few weeks. His father is the former mayor of the Mexican town of Pesqueria.

Fellow student Alfonso Garza, who is also from Mexico and lived at the flat, said: ‘They met at the party. He liked her and she liked him so they went on to the balcony to make out – to kiss and cuddle.’

In a statement read to the inquest, he said: ‘We went out and a friend shouted “they’re not here”.

‘I couldn’t believe it. I walked over and saw them over the edge and he shouted “they’ve jumped”. I looked and could see them lying there.

‘Neither was moving and there was a lot of blood coming from Miguel’s head. Anastasia was lying either on top of him or to the side.’

Investigating officer DI Charmaine Laurencin said: 'Alcohol played a significant part in this incident. I think had neither party consumed so much alcohol potentially they would not have sat on that balcony' (pictured)

Blessing Adedoyin, who saw the pair from her home in neighbouring Cornmill House, said: ‘She was sat and the man was in between her legs, which were open.

‘She had her arms around his head and he was feeling her legs. The guy especially looked drunk because he was moving around and touching her.

‘I just saw the guy’s legs tipping over and they both went down at the same time. He didn’t look very balanced or coordinated and they were locked together when they fell. I saw them go over and just gasped.’

Her partner, events manager Samson Oguntayo, 32, ran down and found the couple in a pool of blood. Emergency services were called just after midnight on June 11. The couple were pronounced dead at the scene.

A post-mortem examination revealed Mr Ramos had 393 micrograms of alcohol in his blood and Miss Tutik had 85, just over the legal driving limit.

No family or friends of the two students were present at the inquest.
