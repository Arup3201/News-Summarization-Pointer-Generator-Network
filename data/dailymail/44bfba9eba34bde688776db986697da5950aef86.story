A man who killed his cousin days after he became a father to a baby daughter was today jailed for 32 years.

John ‘Boy’ Ward had 21-year-old Thomas Ward shot on the doorstep of his caravan in front of his wife and five-day-old daughter in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, by three masked men in an act of revenge.

He told his relative he would deliberately choose the moment he was at his happiest to kill him over a long-standing family feud, which started before Thomas Ward was even born.

The court heard the Ward family had been torn apart after the death of John’s brother Mickey following a car crash in 1987.

Thomas’ father, James ‘Young Fox’ Ward – who was not involved in the incident – was blamed for the incident by Mickey’s side of the family.

The crash erupted into violence and in 1993, James shot dead another of John’s brothers – James ‘Bimbo’ Ward.

St Albans Crown Court heard the murderer had phoned his victim in 2011 and told him: 'It's me, your enemy. I'm going to wait until you are at your happiest - then I'm going to get you.'

Following the birth of his daughter Lilly in April 2013, Thomas told his family he had never been happier.

Seeking revenge and hoping to cause as much distress to his family as possible, John organised for his second cousin to be killed and at around 11.30pm on April 23, 2013.

As the young family slept in their caravan in Dyes Lane, on the edge of Stevenage, they were woken by the smashing of a window.

Thomas opened the door with just a piece of kitchen cutlery for protection to find three masked men outside - one armed with a 12 gauge shotgun.

With his wife Theresa standing behind him Thomas was shot in the chest and died less than an hour later in hospital.

Following the shooting, John, 33, used a fake passport and fled the country, with his 22-year-old wife Joeleen, brother Francis and sister Winifred.

Joeleen, who was five months pregnant, flew out from East Midlands Airport to meet him in Paris.

They went on the run, travelling around France and Spain before settling in Denmark.

Giving evidence during his trial, John said he had panicked and fled after the shooting because he knew he would be blamed.

He claimed he had been at home with his wife the night Thomas was shot.

Ward said he was scared to return to the UK because he had heard there was a £100,000 ‘contract’ out on him.

He was arrested on February 6 this year near Copenhagen, Denmark, and found guilty at an earlier hearing this month.

John Ward, of Hatfield, Hertforshire, appeared via a video link up from Bedford Prison, where he is being held, during today’s sentencing.

Judge Andrew Bright QC told him he would have to serve a minimum term of 32 years behind bars before he could be considered for release.

He told him: ‘Thomas Ward was the victim of a planned and targeted execution in which you played the leading role.’

He said Ward had recruited the gang and then led them to the caravan home of Thomas Ward for the killing to take place.

The court also heard that John was just six-years-old when the feud began in 1987, and Thomas was not even been born.

But unable to escape their past, they were dragged into a bitter family conflict that had been started by previous generations.

Thomas’s funeral last year was seen on a spin off programme of Channel 4’s ‘My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding.’

Detective Chief Inspector Sharn Basra, from Herts Police, said: ‘A young man lost his life in one of the most barbaric way, leaving his baby daughter without a father through no fault of his own.

‘I would like to thank the family for their support of the investigation and their dignity in ensuring justice could prevail.

‘John Boy Ward is clearly an extremely ruthless, violent and dangerous man. Whilst we cannot be clear who pulled the trigger, we know that John Boy instigated, planned and ensured Thomas was killed that night and I am pleased he was has now been given a substantial prison term for his actions.

‘Whilst nothing can bring Thomas back to his family I hope this offers at least some comfort to them.

‘I would also like to make it clear that investigations to identify and trace others who we believe were involved in the planning and facilitation of the killing are on-going. We will continue to make inquiries and speak with people of interest to ensure all those who played a part in Thomas’s murder face justice.’

Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, added: ‘After the incident, John Ward and his pregnant wife, Joeleen Ward, went on the run around Europe.

‘Joeleen was arrested for assisting an offender in January and John was arrested for murder in February in Copenhagen, Denmark on a European Arrest Warrant and extradited to the UK to face the charge. John’s siblings, Francis Ward and Winifred Ward, provided substantial financial assistance to John to help him in his flight from jurisdiction and were arrested and charged with assisting an offender.

‘John claimed not have played any part in the attack, but was convicted of murder despite his denial. Joeleen, Francis and Winifred played a significant part in the aftermath of the murder and have been found guilty of assisting an offender despite their denials.

‘This case represents a tragedy for Thomas’ family, who are distraught by his untimely death. His daughter has been denied the opportunity to know her father.

‘I would like to pay tribute to them for their wholehearted support of this investigation and the dignity they displayed while hearing the horrific details of how Thomas was ambushed and killed.’

Thomas’ family paid tribute to him after the sentencing, describing him as ‘amazing’.

Tributes left at the funeral for Thomas Ward after he was shot by his second cousin John Ward

Hundreds of travellers attended Thomas' funeral, which was on Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Christening

‘We miss him and his beautiful big smile every minute of every day,’ they said.

‘Thomas was good looking, he was flawless and people were very envious of him. He was cheeky but so wonderful too and genuinely cared for everyone, no-one had a bad word to say about him. He was also extremely generous and spent his first ever wages on a present for his mum.’

Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward was held responsible by some family members for the death of his cousin in a car crash in 1987 

Thomas, who grew up in Germany and could speak Spanish and German, was a born-again Christian. He had visited most of Europe and also spent time in America. His family said he was a keen Chelsea supporter and was passionate about fitness and training.

‘He had done so much in his short life but a new chapter as a father had literally just begun,” his family added.

‘He absolutely adored his baby girl and his wife and was a fantastic dad and husband. Every day we are suffering pain because he is not here and it is unbearable to think that his daughter will grow up without her dad. This heart-ache will never leave us.’

John’s wife, Joeleen Ward, 22, who was also on trial with her husband accused of helping him to escape, said her child had been born while they were on the run together in Europe.

In the witness box she spoke of her fears for her son’s future safety because of the family feud.

‘I’m still scared for my son growing up,’ she told the jury.

She was found guilty of a charge of assisting her husband to flee the country, following the shooting, and she will be sentenced in November after reports have been prepared.

John’s brother, Francis Ward, 36, and his sister Winifred, 47, also pleaded not guilty to assisting his escape from the UK.

Francis, of Stable Way in Kensington was convicted of assisting an offender and his sister of Cambridge Road in Hounslow was convicted of an identical charge.

All three will face sentencing in November.

During the trial the court heard that after James ‘Young Fox’ Ward was released from prison in 2001 for the manslaughter of Bimbo, he had been forced to move his family, including Thomas, to Holland, Belgium and Germany for their safety.

Over the years there were threats and incidents between the two sides of the family.

Today Dean Armstrong QC defending said since jury’s finding of guilt against John Boy Ward, police had been investigating internet messages expressing satisfaction over the deaths of him and his two brothers.

Threats had also been made to the young son of John Ward and his wife Joeleen - born while they were on the run.

Mr Armstrong said in prison John ward was in a double cell because of concerns for his welfare.

‘He says a contract remains on his head because of this awful saga.’
