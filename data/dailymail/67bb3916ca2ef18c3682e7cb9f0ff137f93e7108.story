While other residents of Moore, Oklahoma, were hiding in closets or clinging to walls to survive Monday's deadly tornado, one brave mother was giving birth.

Shayla Taylor, 25, was in the middle of labor on the upper floor of Moore Medical Center delivering her second child when the monstrous storm directly hit the tiny local hospital, ripping away the roof and walls.

Taylor's family, including her husband, were sent downstairs to the cafeteria moments before the twister but, being too far along, the 25-year-old was forced to brave both the peak contractions of childbirth and the terrifying storm where she was.

On Wednesday, Taylor relived how she huddled with four selfless nurses who put their lives at risk to help deliver her baby as the floor shook 'like an earthquake' beneath them and ceiling tiles fell from overhead.

'We were all just sitting there holding each others hands and praying,' Taylor told NBC News.

She described hearing the eerie silence of the storm's center before she dared to open her eyes.

'All of a sudden I could see daylight and the wall was gone,' she told the station, adding that she had a clear view of the Warren theater, which later became a triage center for victims.

She had been dilated to nine 
centimeters, enough to deliver the baby, when the quick-thinking nurses 
gave her a shot to slow labor during the storm's peak.

After the carnage, Taylor's husband, Jerome Taylor, 29, rushed upstairs with their four-year-old son, Shaiden, to find his wife in the dark, but otherwise OK.

Still in labor, hospital workers carefully carried the mother through the wrecked building and into a waiting ambulance, which drove her to another hospital five miles away.

Three hours later, Taylor delivered Braeden Immanuel, a healthy 8-pound, 3-ounce boy.

'His middle name means "God is with us,"' Taylor told NBC. 'The name had been picked out for months. Now I know why.'

Taylor is one of 30 patients and hospital staff who survived the tornado at Moore Medical, which was completely destroyed. A spokesman said it was unclear whether they'd rebuild on the site.

The young family lost their car during the tornado, but their house, remarkably, escaped without damage.

Despite their story of survival, Taylor, who has lived in Oklahoma her whole life, is thinking twice about living in Tornado Alley, now she is a mother-of-two.

'The tornadoes always track through here,' she told NBC. 'It's not to say everybody's going to pack and leave tomorrow, but they start to reconsider things.'
