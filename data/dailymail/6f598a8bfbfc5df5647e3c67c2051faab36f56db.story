Passengers who scored Singapore Airlines business class seats at economy prices thanks to a computer error are being forced to re-book or cough up the difference in airfare.

For some, that means they will have to spend an additional £2,700 to keep their seats in the roomier cabin.

The carrier is reportedly refusing to honour the original business class bookings for around 900 customers - even though travel agents claim the carrier is responsible for the error.

Economy: Singapore Airlines wants customers to pay the difference to keep their business class seats

The ‘cheap’ fares were sold by agents in Australia between Sunday and Monday for flights between Singapore and destinations in Europe, reports news.com.au.

The flights were reportedly incorrectly loaded into the system by the airline and agents claim the carrier is now demanding they notify their clients and charge them the difference.

Travel agents who do not recover the money have been told they will have to pay up themselves.

A Singapore Airlines spokeswoman told news.com.au: ‘We have been notified that a small number of travel agents have sold tickets against this reassigned business class subclass, at an economy class fare level.

‘The airfare conditions for the fare clearly stated that it was only valid for economy class travel.

‘We are working with our travel agent partners to ensure that our customers are notified of this issue so that steps can be made to ensure there is no disruption to their travel plans,’

Passengers who do not want to fork out more cash are eligible for a full refund or they can rebook with an economy class seat and receive the difference between the two fares.

A Flight Centre spokesman told news.com.au that its agents became aware of the issue on Saturday and notified Singapore Airlines, but the airline did not rectify the problem until Monday.
