Family doctors have been reprimanded for leaving answerphone messages when they are at lunch or in a meeting telling patients to dial the NHS 111 service.

Health bosses have written to GP practices warning them it is a breach of contract to divert patients to the new helpline during normal working hours.

NHS England – the new body in charge of the Health Service – said some practices had been leaving recorded messages when they closed for lunch or during meetings.

Don't leave a message: GPs have been reprimanded for leaving voicemail messages when they are out for lunch and daytime meetings telling patients to dial the 111 out-of-hours service for advice and treatment

The British Medical Association, which represents GPs, accused the organisation of trying to deflect the blame over its disastrous launch of the helpline.

The system was expanded nationally this spring to provide medical advice for patients round-the-clock as long as it isn’t a 999 emergency.

But there are concerns patients are being put at risk because they are being given the wrong information by unqualified call centre workers manning the phones.

Under their contract with the NHS, GPs must provide care for patients between 8am and 6.30pm, Monday to Friday. But many surgeries close for lunch or on certain afternoons when doctors hold meetings, training sessions or work elsewhere.

Some have an arrangement with an out-of-hours firm or locum doctors who provide temporary cover during these times. Any patient ringing the surgery at these times will be played a recorded message telling them to call the firm or locum if they cannot wait until it re-opens.

But NHS England said it had been made aware that a handful of practices were leaving messages urging patients to dial NHS 111.

A letter sent out to all practices in the capital last month states: ‘It has recently come to our attention that there are an increasing number of examples of where GP practices are diverting patients to NHS 111 during their core hours of 08.00-18.30 on Monday-Friday.’

Second best: There are concerns patients are being put at risk because unqualified call centre workers are giving them the wrong information

It reminds them that diversion of patients to 111 during lunchtimes, half-days or if they suddenly become busy is a ‘misuse’ of the service.

The letter, signed by the three senior managers, adds that practices will be issued with ‘breach notices’ if they are found to be referring patients to the helpline.

This could lead to them having their contracts terminated and being closed down.

The BMA accused NHS England of ‘bullying’ GPs and being overly ‘heavy-handed’ when only a few surgeries were at fault.

Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the BMA’s General Practitioners’ Committee, said that practices had been mistakenly using the same answerphone message during the day time as is played out-of-hours.

When the surgery is closed during evenings and weekends, patients will be told to dial NHS 111.

But some practices may mistakenly using this same message during the daytime when they should record a separate one telling patients to call to firm providing cover.

He said: ‘This is a problem which could easily have been solved without some threatening letter to practices.

‘It’s bullying. There’s been so much reaction to NHS England’s position and failings over NHS 111 and it’s like they are trying to deflect the blame which really isn’t acceptable.’

There is growing tension between the Government and the BMA over its plans to force doctors to be responsible for patients round-the-clock.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt last month angered GPs for claiming that a contract that enabled them to give-up working evenings and weekends had led to soaring numbers of patients attending A&E units.
