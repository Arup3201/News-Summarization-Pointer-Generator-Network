No offence is intended to the loyal assistant stepping into the breach. But you get the impression that, without Ally McCoist in the opposing technical area on Saturday, something will be missing for Hibs boss Alan Stubbs.

There was more than just professional respect between two former Old Firm warriors who, despite some of the absolute lunacy that goes on around the fringes of both clubs, found plenty of time to be the friendliest of foes during their playing days at the big two.

So, as warmly as he’ll welcome caretaker boss Kenny McDowall, there’s a feeling that the former Celtic defender will be sparing at least a thought or two for the man who finally decided to walk away from a much-changed, majorly-diminished, barely-recognisable Rangers.

During his days at Celtic Alan Stubbs formed a respectful rivalry with former Rangers player Ally McCoist

‘I had the utmost respect for Ally as a player - and we were known to socialise once or twice in Glasgow,’ said Stubbs with a grin and, unless there was something wrong with the lighting, a very definite reddening of the cheeks.

‘The rivalry between Rangers and Celtic was so intense, of course, but we got on great. There were are a group of players who, if we saw each other in town, would stop and have a couple of drinks before going our separate ways. It was total respect.

‘When we played against each other, there was still that respect, but we wanted to... actually I can’t say what we wanted to do to each other! We wanted to win, that’s all I will say.

‘Playing against him, he was a good player, a real pain. We used to have words and a bit of banter, naturally, but there was always respect. His record speaks for itself. He was a fantastic goal scorer and, no matter what anyone says, he did what he had to do as a manager by getting Rangers promoted twice.

‘It’s not ideal how it panned out and I really feel for Ally. I wish him all the best and hope he’s back in football soon. I will look to make contact with him soon and speak to him, that’s just the decent thing to do.’

Any manager in the land watching McCoist in the months and years since Rangers plunged into insolvency must have felt a range of emotions. Sympathy, naturally, for a fellow pro who had to act as leader, spokesman, figurehead *and* overall boss of an entire football department while a variety of men in suits made bold promises about what they’d do next.

Virtually every other head coach in Scotland would also confess, though, to feeling more than a bit of envy as they watched Rangers continue to spend as if tomorrow was just a rumour. Even this ‘slimmed-down’ organisation is losing around £1million a month, yet still they allowed the manager to make signings.

Addressing the two sides of the rebuilding job that fell upon McCoist from a great height, Stubbs said: ‘The one thing I would say is: Ally knew exactly what he was going into.

‘People will look at us managers and say we are stupid, we’re thick. They are probably right - but it’s the buzz you get from the job. When things are going well, it’s fantastic, when things are not going well you need to find a way to turn things around quickly.

Rangers chief Derek Llambias has opened up the possibility of  McDowall taking a permanent role in charge

‘When you are at a really top club, where the demands are so high and the pressure is always on, if you don’t deliver you run the risk of this happening. It’s the same at any club. It is a results business and unfortunately Ally has paid the price, rightly or wrongly.

‘Rangers obviously have resources, because they have the biggest budget, but it’s about how you spend it. I have a budget here and I need to get the best out of it. The biggest budget will not always win you the league and, at the moment, the league bears that out with Hearts having such a big lead.’

Asked if he thought a club continuing to spend when they’re heading for another financial meltdown was akin to cheating, a laughing Stubbs said: ‘No comment! Listen, they started the season with a budget. Whether it’s fair or not, they have the players. The club is losing money, but it’s not my problem or Hibs’ problem.’
