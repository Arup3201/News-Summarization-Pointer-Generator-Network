Joy: Hazel griffiths, half sister of missing schoolgirl April Jones, has given birth to a baby girl, Amelia, pictured

The despairing family of schoolgirl April Jones, who went missing while playing outside her home 11 weeks ago, have been given a boost in time for Christmas - the arrival of a new baby girl.

April's half-sister Hazel gave birth to the little girl, named Amelia, giving the family some joy after more than two months of heartbreak.

Despite her young age, five-year-old April would have been an aunt to the new arrival.

April's parents Coral and Paul are said to be 'delighted' by the birth.

A family friend said: 'The new baby has given everyone a lift and it's come at the right time of year.

'Hazel will be a lovely mum - she was seven months pregnant when April went missing so it has been hard for her.

'But you only have to look at the pictures to see the new baby is spreading a bit of joy around.'

Proud new mother Hazel posted pictures of her daughter on Facebook alongside a snap of April and pink ribbons which have become a symbol for the search for her.

April's mum Coral, 40, left a message to say that she 'likes' the photos.

Local councillor Michael Williams, who lives on the same estate as the Jones family said that news of the baby will bring some 'Christmas cheer' to the family who have had such a terrible time.

He said: 'She will bring considerable joy to the Jones family and to the towns people of Machynlleth. Everyone is happy with the new arrival, particularly at this time of year.

'It has been such a hard time for them but they have coped really well.'

Hazel and her younger sister Abby are Paul's daughters from a relationship before he met Coral.

Tragic: Five-year-old April Jones has been missing since October 1

The the three girls were said to have been very close and Hazel and Abby referred to the

missing five-year-old as their 'little sister'.

April vanished on October 1 while riding her bike close to the family home in Machynlleth, Powys.

Police are continuing to search for her, with the operation expected to be scaled down for two weeks over Christmas.

So far, the search, which is one of the largest in UK history, has cost Â£2.4million.

The couple accept that they will never see their 'beautiful little girl' again.

They said in a statement: 'We are soming to terms with the fact that our baby girl has been taken from us.

'The messages of support from all over the UK have continued and we remain grateful that we are in people's thoughts and prayers.

'It has shown us that people really do come together at difficult times.'

Mark Bridger, 46, has been charged with April's murder, abduction and perverting the course of justice.
