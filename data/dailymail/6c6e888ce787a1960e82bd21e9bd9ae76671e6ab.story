Rielle Hunter says the first time she slept with John Edwards was the 'most extraordinary night of her life.'

Lurid details continue to emerge about the affair that annihilated the two-time presidential candidate's political career as Hunter's tell-all memoir slowly leaks to the public.

The couple met in February 2006 at the Regency Hotel in New York City. Hours after Hunter approached the former North Carolina Senator, he called her up to his hotel room for a night of 'surrender' and 'zero sleep.'

Hunter claims she wrote the book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' to publicly explanation the six-year romance to the couple's love child, Frances Quinn Hunter. However, the former campaign videographer seems to leave little to the imagination about her sex life.

The book is due out June 26. An extensive interview with ABC News will air Friday on '20/20.'

Hunter says she caught Edwards' eye at the hotel when she followed him out of a reception and said, 'You are so hot.'

Hours later, she got a call from him inviting her to his room.

She claims she went only because she thought she could give Edwards advice for his presidential campaign. But that all changed the moment she was alone behind closed doors with 'her Johnny.'

'The connection I felt when I walked in the door had only grown and the amount of energy between us was huge and unstoppable,' Hunter writes, according to an excerpt obtained by Radar Online.

'And then a moment came while we were talking when something in my heart clicked and I surrendered. I took off my teacher hat, let go of all my resistance to him and let him lead. And lead he did. He led me toward the most extraordinary night of my life. There was a lot of talk, a lot of laughter and zero sleep.'

But Hunter says she didn't give in easily to sleeping with a married man -- it took Edwards telling her a story about having three other mistresses to get her into bed that first night they met.

'He told me that he had an entire hidden life that had gone on for decades and that he was currently involved with three different women. One lived in Los Angeles, one in Florida, and one in Chicago,' Hunter writes, according to Radar Online.

'Clearly, this behavior of his was not going to change overnight... I also told him that if I was going to help him, he couldn't lie to me. He needed to have one person in his life that was safe for him. He said that wasn't a problem, and when he said that, I felt a wave of total relief roll off of him. He needed this safe place. Somewhere in the midst of our talk, long after I realized how far off the rails his marriage was, and for how long it had been that way, something happened between us.'

But Edwards did lie to Hunter. He lied that night about the three other mistresses -- and used the lie to manipulate her for five years. He didn't come clean about his love life until 2011, she says.

Edwards had two other mistresses, he said, but both those affairs ended before his 2004 bid to become Vice President.

Hunter, 48, says she spent most of her 20s snorting cocaine as she pursued an acting career in New York.

But she got past drug abuse before she turned 30 and replaced it, she claims, with a quest for 'spiritual growth.'

The book contains a full-throated defense of her lover -- even as she is coy about the status of their relationship.

Hunter
attacks Edwards' wife Elizabeth, who died in December 2010 of breast cancer, 
calling her 'crazy,' 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.'

She says her abusive behavior toward John Edwards drove him into the arms of other women.

Other accounts of the 2008 
presidential campaign, including 'Game Change' by journalists John 
Heilemann and Mark Halperin back up Hunter's portrait of Elizabeth 
Edwards as controlling and potentially abusive.

He also blasts Andrew Young, John Edwards top aide, who helped hide the affair for several years.Â 

She
says it was Young's idea for Edwards and Hunter and lie and say 
Hunter's baby, Quinn, belonged to him and not the presidential 
candidate.

Hunter
repeated the lie in an interview with the National Enquirer and 
Edwards, famously, told ABC News during an August 2008 broadcast that 
the baby was not his.

He didn't publicly acknowledge his love child until 2010, when she was nearly two.

Hunter's book is a window into the life of a political mistress.

Major
New York publishers had said they were not interested in Hunter's book,
citing her negative image, so it is instead being released through a 
Dallas-based boutique publisher, BenBella Books.

She describes waiting for hours at hotel bars for her lover to swoop in off the campaign trail.

They
often shared hurried dinners over take-out before short, passionate 
romps. Then, Edwards had to leave and return to his cancer-stricken wife
and his life in the public eye.

When Edwards faced the prospect of an
indictment that could put him behind bars, he calmly told Hunter he 
would probably wind up in a low-security prison in Virginia more like a 
country club than a jail.

Disgraced: Former senator John Edwards was acquitted on one count of accepting illegal campaign funds and a mistrial was declared on the five other counts

She quickly responded that she and their daughter would move there to be near him if that happened.

Federal prosecutors spent a year prosecuting Edwards, culminating in a six-week trial that ended last month.

Jurors acquitted Edwards on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions and deadlocked on five other felony counts.

The
judge declared a mistrial. Federal prosecutors then said in a court 
order earlier this month that they wouldn't retry Edwards, and the 
charges against him were dropped.

Neither Edwards nor Hunter testified.

Prosecutors
had accused Edwards, 59, of masterminding a scheme to use about $1 
million in secret payments from two wealthy political donors to hide his
pregnant mistress as he sought the White House in 2008.

The trial publicized intimate details about Edwards' affair with Hunter as his wife, Elizabeth, was dying of cancer.
