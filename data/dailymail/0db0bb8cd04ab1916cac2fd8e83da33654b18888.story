Tottenham and West Ham's Premier League match was interrupted when a fan ran on to take a free-kick for Spurs.

The fan ran on to the pitch and made a break for the players down at West Ham's end. Stewards attempted to tackle the invader but they failed to reach him before he could leave his mark on proceedings.

Christian Eriksen was primed to take a free-kick on the edge of the box but the fan, with stewards trailing behind him, hoofed the ball over the wall and into the stands.

Eriksen then raised his hands over his head - it was unclear whether it was a reaction to the fan's narrow miss, or the fact that he had disrupted the game. 

After a small celebration, the pitch invader was bundled to the ground by stewards and taken away. 

Scotland Yard have confirmed that the fan has been arrested and is being held at a police station in East London. 

Tottenham eventually won the game 1-0, but it could have gone either way. Kyle Naughton was sent off for blocking a shot with his hands but Sam Allardyce's men failed to make Spurs pay as Mark Noble fired the subsequent penalty wide.

James Collins then saw red for a second bookable offence. And this time Spurs took advantage. 

New signing Eric Dier popped up with a late winner to round off a memorable derby in east London.
