Texas police in both Austin and Dallas are investigating a series of overdoses on synthetic marijuana.

In 2011, the Texas Department of State Health Services made 'marijuana-like substances that are commonly found in K2, Spice and other synthetic marijuana products' illegal.

Last week in a 23-hour period, Austin police and EMS services 'responded to or received information about' 15 possible K2 overdoses, police said in a statement on Thursday.

All the victims 'became unconscious or responsive' and some were 'disoriented and violent' after they woke up, police said.

Police said they are investigating the drug's source and whether or not it may have been laced.

Drug arrests have since been made in downtown Austin, police said in a statement on Friday, but no one has been arrested for K2.

'We have made narcotics arrests and some of the people arrested had K2 on them,' Public Information Specialist Lisa Cortinas said in an email statement to MailOnline.

'That K2 was seized and is currently being tested to see if contains anything that is illegal. Just K2 by itself is not illegal so we can't arrest anyone for it.'

'At least 40' synthetic marijuana overdoses have occurred in the last 48 hours, according to one report

A hospital source told MailOnline that in Dallas, Baylor Medical Center saw between 38 - 44 people over a 5-day period that began on Thursday who appeared to be intoxicated or under the influence of a drug.

At Parkland Hospital, 18 patients were seen over a two-day period that started Thursday, according to a report by NBC-DFW.

Narcotics detectives interviewed two of the overdose victims and are following leads, Maj. Max Geron of the Dallas Police Department told MailOnline in an email statement.

'We have since conducted some "knock and talk" investigations to determine the source of the overdoses with no results this far,' Geron said.

Geron said police did no of any deaths from the recent overdoses, but stressed that 'it typically takes several months before any toxicology results are returned from the Medical Examinerâ€™s Office.'
