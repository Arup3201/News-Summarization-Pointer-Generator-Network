Faye Walters, 29, eventually had a perfect smile for her wedding day - after five months of corrective treatment for a set of botched veneers 

A young woman was devastated to be left with shattered black teeth just months before her wedding due to a botched set of veneers.

Faye Walters, 28, had worn veneers since she was 15 after being bullied throughout her childhood for having discoloured teeth.

She hoped a new set before her wedding would boost her self-confidence and was initially delighted with her new white smile.

But she was horrified when her two of her teeth shattered when she bit into a bagel - and closer inspection revealed all the other veneers had turned grey.

She discovered her gums and teeth had been badly damaged due to the botched veneers, fitted by a dentist she had known since she was a child.

A veneer is a thin layer of porcelain made to fit over the front surface of a tooth, like a false fingernail fits over a nail. 

To make matters worse, she was then left with a £7,000 bill to fix her smile – along with five months' worth of corrective treatment.

Miss Walters had not realised that her dentist, whom she had been visiting for years, had no extra qualifications or training for fitting veneers.

After finding a dentist who specialised in veneers, her teeth were saved and she had a perfect smile for her wedding.

She is now sharing her story in the hope that others will do their research before having veneers fitted.

Miss Walters, from Buckingham, said: 'It was only after my veneer completely shattered when I was eating a bagel that I discovered the full extent of the problem.

'It was disgusting, I could see my tooth was black. It was something I was so conscious of because of the bullying I'd suffered at school.

'Playground bullies picked on me for having large front teeth that were discoloured due to mineral imbalances.

'I was so upset that my mum decided I needed veneers.' 

After being fitted with her first set at 15, she had no problems until they were replaced in 2010 at a cost of around £2,000. 

Miss Walters added: 'After my tooth shattered and the other veneer cracked, I lost faith in my old dentist so I went online to do some research to try and understand what sort of qualifications people should have to fit them.

'I discovered there were courses for dentists to make sure they have all the information they need to fit veneers properly, and that my original dentist didn't have those.

Miss Walters had six veneers fitted by her local, trusted dentist in July 2010. Initially she was happy with the result, but they later shattered as she was biting into a bagel. It emerged her teeth had cracked, turned black and grey and her gums had been damaged

'I found one who did and when he saw my teeth he was horrified.

'He said it was the worst case of its kind he had seen in his 25-year career.

'The new dentist told me the veneers had not been fitted correctly and there was a gap between my gums and the veneers.

'This meant bacteria was getting in and eating away at the bond which holds everything together.'

A veneer is a thin layer of porcelain made to fit over the front surface of a tooth, like a false fingernail fits over a nail.

Veneers can improve the colour, shape and position of teeth. A precise shade of porcelain can be chosen to give the right colour to improve a single discoloured tooth or to lighten the front teeth.

A veneer can make a chipped tooth look intact again. The porcelain covers the whole of the front of the tooth with a thicker section replacing the broken part.

Veneers can also be used to close small gaps, when braces are not suitable.

If one tooth is slightly out of position, a veneer can sometimes be fitted to bring it into line with the others.

Veneers should last for many years; but they can chip or break, just as teeth can. Small chips can be repaired, or a new veneer fitted if necessary.

Porcelain veneers should last between five and twenty years, while composite veneers last a year or two at most.

The costs for this treatment can vary from practice to practice so it is important to discuss charges and treatment options with the dentist before starting treatment.

All six of Miss Walters' veneers needed replacing and she also had to undergo painful treatment on her gums, as well as ongoing treatment to tackle the gum disease she was left with.

The treatment cost £7,366.20 and had to be carried out over a five-month period, but was thankfully complete before her wedding to fiancé Matthew, 35, in September 2014.

Miss Walters said: 'I was planning my wedding and all I could think about was how grey my teeth would look in the photographs, or the possibility of having a veneer falling out.'

She took legal action against her old dentist who had fitted her six veneers so poorly.

She was eventually paid £10,000 in compensation, covering the cost of her new set, and also helping to compensate for her pain and suffering.

Now, with her teeth fully repaired and her gums healed, she has a nice set of wedding pictures in which include plenty of smiles.

But Miss Walters says she will never forget her ordeal and is calling for much tighter regulation of dentists.

'I don't think dentists should be allowed to perform cosmetic dental procedures without having gone through additional training,' she said.

'My first dentist had lots of certificates in his waiting room and I always felt as though I could trust him as he was a professional.

'I didn't know there was anything drastically wrong and because I trusted him I never questioned it.

'He had been my dentist since I was a little girl and I had known him all my life.

'Thankfully my new dentist cleaned my teeth and managed to save them before fitting my new veneers. They are great now and everything has healed.'

Sarah Smith, litigation assistant at Neil Hudgell Solicitors, represented Miss Walters in her compensation claim.

Miss Walters found a new dentist who was able to restore her teeth in time for her wedding to Matthew, 35, in September 2014. She is now calling for cosmetic dentists to be regulated

She believes the case is a good example of the need for greater regulation of industries such as cosmetic surgery and dentistry.

She said: 'All too often we represent clients who have suffered as a result of dental or cosmetic surgery negligence and, as in this case, patients can suffer both financially and emotionally.

'Having veneers fitted is a very costly procedure and we were very pleased to have secured a positive outcome for Faye.

'However, we hope her case sends out a clear message to others that cosmetic dentistry, and any form of cosmetic surgery, is not something people should rush into.'

Before seeking treatment, check the dentist is registered with the General Dental Council

In the UK, the General Dental Council has lists of all registered dentists.

Before you seek treatment, check the dentist is registered.

Some dentists with special training or experience will also be on the Specialist Lists and can call themselves a ‘specialist’.

These include areas such as orthodontists - who prevent or correct irregularities in the teeth, bite and jaw and prosthodontics - who are qualified to replace missing teeth by crowns, bridges, dentures which may be fixed or removable.
