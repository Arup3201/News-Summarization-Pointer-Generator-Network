Loretta Lynch won approval from a key Senate committee Thursday to serve as the nation's next attorney general, as divided Republicans clashed over her support for President Barack Obama's immigration policies.

The 12 to 8 vote in the Judiciary Committee sent Lynch's nomination to the full Senate. 

Lynch is a career prosecutor who is currently the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.

Three Republicans – Orrin Hatch of Utah, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina – joined all none committee Democrats in voting 'yes.'

Attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday but her fate in the full Senate could be a squeaker

THE 'LYNCH' MOB? Republican senators Orrin Hatch of Utah, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina all voted to confirm Obama's pick for the top job at the Justice Department

'The case against her nomination, as far as I can tell, essentially ignores her professional career and focuses solely on about six hours that she spent before this committee,' Hatch said as he criticized fellow Republicans for using Lynch's testimony in support of Obama's executive actions on immigration as a reason to oppose her nomination.

Timing is uncertain, but Lynch is all but assured approval by the full Senate as well, under new rules that will require only a majority vote of 51 instead of the 60-vote margin required for most legislation.

But she appears unlikely to win confirmation resoundingly, as Thursday's debate demonstrated that many Republicans will oppose her over Obama's executive actions granting work permits and deportation stays for millions of immigrants in the United States illegally.

'We should not confirm someone to that position who intends to continue that unlawful policy,' said Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions.

Lynch, 55, now serves as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. She would replace Eric Holder, the nation's longest-serving attorney general, and become the first black woman to hold the top law enforcement job.

At her Jan. 28 confirmation hearing, Lynch sought to smooth interactions with Republicans, who have repeatedly clashed with Holder, by emphasizing her determination for a 'new and improved' relationship.

But Senate Republicans delayed a scheduled vote on her nomination two weeks ago in order to further scrutinize Lynch's record, in particular her support of the Obama immigration plan and a settlement she forged with HSBC Holdings PLC in 2012 over money-laundering allegations.

Republicans have criticized Lynch for not probing the bank further over tax evasion at the time her office negotiated a$1.2 billion accord with them.

Since her hearing, a Texas district court has thrown Obama's executive order on immigration into legal limbo and HSBC has come under fire over allegations it helped clients evade taxes in their home countries. 

Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said after the vote that he feared Lynch will not be independent of the White House, a problemthe GOP has articulated often against Holder.

'The current Attorney General has permitted politics to drive decision making far too often. For that reason, the question for me has been whether Ms. Lynch will make a clean break and take the Department of Justice in a new direction,' said Grassle, who voted against her. 

'After thoroughly reviewing Ms. Lynch’s testimony, both before the committee and in written follow-up questions, I remain unconvinced she will lead the department in a different direction.'

New rules require only a simple majority vote of 51 on presidential nominees, so she could be confirmed quickly

Vote will not be overwhelming because Lynch supports Obama administration 'amnesty' on immigration
