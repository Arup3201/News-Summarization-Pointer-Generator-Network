Premiership side Bath have been given permission to increase the capacity of their iconic Recreation Ground to 14,000 for the next two seasons.

The Rec will grow from holding 12,000 to 14,000 temporarily as the West County club look to increase attendances.

Bath will celebrate its 150th anniversary next season and the increase has been planned to coincide with this.

Growing: Bath's Recreation Ground will increase its capacity from 12,000 to 14,000 for two seasons

The temporary planning application was approved by the council, meaning they can push ahead with the temporary increase.

Bath finished fifth in last season's Premiership to qualify for the European Rugby Champions Cup this year. 

'This extra capacity will allow more people to get closer to the action during a landmark year in our history,' Bath chief executive Nick Blofeld said.
