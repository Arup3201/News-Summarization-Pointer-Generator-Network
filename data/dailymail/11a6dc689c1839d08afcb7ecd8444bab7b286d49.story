Like plenty of 40-something Australian men, Gus Worland spent Boxing Day last year watching the Test match over beers with his best mate.

But unlike most, Worland's best friend is Hollywood A-lister Hugh Jackman.

After a long day of drinking, the pair's conversation turned to Worland's health – or lack thereof.

His best friend of 40 years Hugh Jackman challenged him to change his lifestyle and film it for a TV show

'The next morning Jacko said "We had a brilliant time but it looks like you've been doing those days more often than you should",' Worland told Daily Mail Australia.

'Little did I know he'd had a chat with my wife and she had said to him perhaps if you get the right moment you should bring that up.'

It was a difficult discussion for the friends of 40 years but Worland knew that Jackman was right.

The 45-year-old, who hosts Triple M breakfast radio as part of the Grill Team, was a smoker, a drinker and he tipped the scales at over 140kg.

For years he had tried various fad diets and weight loss pills but nothing had stuck.

So Worland and Jackman, 46, came up with the idea to change Worland's lifestyle and turn it into a TV show in the process.

'We thought we might be able to show people you can lose weight through fun and a challenge rather than just a personal trainer yelling at you,' he said.

'And I'm probably more likely to keep weight off if we do it our way than just have fun.'

They signed a contract with Foxtel, who the pair had previous worked with on the An Aussie Goes series. Three separate seasons followed Worland as he immersed himself with cricket fans in England, India and the West Indies – all after a challenge from Jackman.

Fast forward more than six months and Worland has lost 30kg and is preparing to fly to the US to run in the New York City Marathon this Sunday. The first episode of Gus Worland: Marathon Man will air next Thursday November 6.

But Worland, who lives with his family on Sydney's Northern Beaches, says it has been a lot of effort to get this point.

The first thing he tackled was his smoking addiction, having his last cigarette on December 31 last year.

The second thing he had to change was his diet.

Before he started training for the marathon, his daily food intake was massive.

'For breakfast I'd have eggs and bacon with lots of toast, then mid-morning I'd have either bakery food – like a couple of cakes or sausage rolls - or I'd grab two cheeseburgers from Maccas,' he said.

'Then I'd have some sort of lunch like a chicken schnitzel roll maybe with some chips.

'In the afternoon I'd have a finger bun when I picked up the kids from school.

'Dinner would be a normal dinner of protein with veggies and salad, then later I'd have a cup of tea and a couple of rows of choccy.'

But he says that is the 'old Gus'. Now he has cut out sugar and processed food, and started eating more fruit and vegetables.

He still has bacon and eggs for breakfast, but he's swapped the toast for avocado or tomato.

 Mid-morning he has a piece of fruit, followed by a chicken wrap or chicken salad for lunch.

He has another piece of fruit in the afternoon followed by a dinner of fish or chicken with salad and veggies. And he's stopped having an after dinner snack.

Worland says he's also cut down on alcohol.

'Basically I've stopped the grog, I might have a couple of beers a week,' he said.

'Before that the old Gus would have had a good filling of grog - I reckon probably one big lunch a week because of radio industry, a couple of bottles of wine and a case of beer.'

Since filming started in April, Worland has also committed to a five-day-a-week exercise regimen with the help of personal trainer and nutritionist Brad Pamp.

'For the first eight weeks all I did was walk, starting at 20 minutes the first week and building up to two hours,' he said.

'At the end of eight weeks I started walking for four minutes, running for one, and I'd do that for an hour. 

He slowly increased the number of minutes he was running until he could run for five minutes without needing a walking break.

After three months of training he completed a 5km run. After four months he ran 10km. Three months in he ran a half marathon. 

The whole time Jackman has been talking to Worland over phone, email and Skype and encouraging him to push harder with his training.

'We talk every day pretty much – it's perfect timing as I'm driving to work because it's early afternoon New York time,' Worland said.

'He just fills me in on what is going on in his life, and keeps giving advice like "Your kids are watching you, if you do this you'll set such a great example."'

Worland and Jackman have been best friends ever since they met at Pymble Public School on Sydney's Upper North Shore in the 1970s.

'The first day of school I held his hand walking into the class room,' Worland said.

'He's more like a brother to me – his mum left the family home at a reasonably young age and his dad had five kids and he needed people to look after various kids at different times.

'Jacko seemed to come to our place and stay for three or four months at a time.'

Since then they've been best men at each other's weddings, godfathers for each other's children and Jackman will be there when Worland runs the Marathon in New York this Sunday.

Worland will also be cheered on by his wife Vicky and their three children - Jack, 14, Ella, 13 and Abi, 11 – who have been a great source of support throughout his training.

Worland has mixed feelings about the Marathon now it is less than a week away.

'I'm anxious and excited – I don't want to let anyone down,' he said.

'But I'm so proud and so confident I can do it.'

Worland is also confident that he will be able to keep up his new, healthy lifestyle after the cameras stop rolling.

'The underlying thing is I'm moving and I'm eating better and if you do that you'll be feeling better,' he said.

'My family and my mates won't let me give up, and my body now rejects crappy food, it really does.

'I've said that in the past but I think this time I might have cracked it.'
