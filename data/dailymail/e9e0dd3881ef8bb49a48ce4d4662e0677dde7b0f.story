Florida police have arrested a bouncer involved in a violent brawl more than a week ago outside a Fort Lauderdale beach bar, after a cell phone video of the fight went viral.

Arnald Thomas-Darrah, 30, was charged with felony battery yesterday for his part in the July 28 clash, and another bouncer, Jovan Ralfhel Dean, 35, will be charged with misdemeanor battery.

The 15-second video of the fracas shows victim Alex Coelho, 29, standing outside Dirty Blondes Sports Bar on North Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard before being brutally assaulted by Thomas-Darrah. Another man, David Parker, 27, was also assaulted by Dean.

When police arrived on the scene, however, it was Coelho and Parker who were arrested.

According to a police report, Coelho and some friends had arrived at the bar but were escorted from the premises after getting into a verbal altercation with a bartender. Outside, Coelho was demanding to speak to Dirty Blondes' manager when the fight occurred.

Coehlo's arrest report states that Coelho and Parker were bleeding and screaming at Dirty Blondes' staff. The report says Coelho refused orders to stop yelling and making physical threats to bar employees.

Officer Marc Decarlo claims that Coelho approached him and 'pushed and shoved this officer in the chest.'

Coelho was charged with battery on a 
police officer and disorderly conduct while Parker was charged with 
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.

Coelho was taken to Broward Health Medical Center and needed six stitches over his right eye and several over his left eye, the police report said.

The cell phone video shows Coelho standing outside the bar with his arms around his girlfriend surrounded by at least three men wearing black shirts with 'Security' written on the back.

In the next moment, Thomas-Darrah is punching Coelho without apparent provocation.

When Coelho falls to the ground, Thomas-Darrah stomps on his head. As Coelho flees, bent double and clutching his head, Thomas-Darrah can be heard to call, 'Have a nice day!'

The owner of Dirty Blondes told NBC 6 that Coelho and his friends were kicked out of the bar for arguing with a bartender about the amount of alcohol in their drinks.

A.J. Yaari told the Sun-Sentinal that he had reviewed the video and it doesn't tell the whole story.

'It looks like it was a bunch of troublemakers who came to the bar drunk causing trouble,' he said. 'Now, they are just trying to make us look bad.'

Friends of 
Coelho told the Broward Times that Coelho and Parker are 'both nice and not 
the type of kids to start problems with bouncers.'

After the brawl, the cell phone video was posted to Instagram on July 28 and quickly spread.

A Facebook page called 'Boycott Dirty Blondes' sprang up, where Mary Ann Crespo, a friend of Coelho and his girlfriend, posted a markedly different story to the one given by Dirty Blondes management (edited).Â 

'This is a video of my friend Stephanie and her boyfriend, Alex. They 
were at Blondies yesterday, got a drink they didn't like, asked for a 
new one (offering to pay for both) and then got verbally attacked by 
the bartender. When they asked the security guys at the door for the 
manager, this is what happened!' she wrote alongside a posting of the video.

Yesterday, outraged friends and supporters of Coelho and Parker staged a protest outside Dirty Blondes.

'I watched the video time and time again and I'm absolutely beside myself every time I see it,'

'I'm here to today to support the cause of having a little bit more screening and control over our security - people that are supposed to be securing us and not assaulting us when we are out on the town,' a protestor named Justin told NBC 6.

'This isn't an isolated incident, it's just one that happened to catch wind. There's a lot of people coming out and saying things like this have happened.'

After such loud and public outcry, yesterday Fort Lauderdale police made this statement:

'The Fort Lauderdale Police Department is aware of the short clip that has been circulating via YouTube and social media, and we are looking into the details surrounding this incident.'At this time there have been no reports filed with this agency depicting the incident that was captured on this video. The agency encourages both of the individuals arrested to come forward and file police reports regarding the altercation that took place prior to our arrival on scene.

'Incidents received by this agency will be given the professional and thorough attention that is deemed necessary.'

On Friday, almost a week after the event, Coelho entered a full report of the incident at a Fort Lauderdale police station and positively identified the bouncers involved.

On Sunday, police traveled to the Oakland Park residence of Thomas-Darrah and arrested him. Charges against Dean are pending.
