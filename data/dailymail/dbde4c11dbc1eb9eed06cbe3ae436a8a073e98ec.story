A Dutch tourist accused of murdering a British former public schoolgirl in India claimed he launched his frenzied knife attack because he was possessed by the Devil.

The boyfriend of backpacker Sarah Groves yesterday said Richard de Wit, 43, coolly admitted the crime and told him: ‘I killed  her – that’s it. The Devil took over my body.’

Miss Groves, 24, an ex-pupil of £30,240-a-year St Mary’s School in Ascot, Berkshire, was stabbed around 40 times on a houseboat near Kashmir’s capital Srinagar in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Tragedy: Sarah Groves, 24, was an ex-pupil of £30,240-a-year St Mary’s School in Ascot, Berkshire

The daughter of a wealthy businessman 
from Guernsey had been staying with her boyfriend Saeed Ahmed Shoda, 25,
whom she met in the Indian resort of Goa in January.

Yesterday Mr Shoda, whose family own 
the New Beauty houseboat on the idyllic Dal Lake, said he had confronted
de Wit, a 7ft cannabis user, and begged for answers.

Mr Shoda said de Wit’s response was 
brazen and ‘not normal’, adding: ‘I saw him at the police station and I 
asked him, why did you kill her?

‘The killer is not right in his head.
He is not of this world. He doesn’t seem okay when you speak to him. He will not divulge anything  about his crime, he has confessed to the 
crime but will not give any details.

Saeed Shoda described Miss Groves as 'perfect' and the pair were planning a trekking holiday together

'I want him hanged.  He had no 
reason to kill her. She didn’t do anything wrong. I just don’t 
understand.’

Indian police said de Wit had  confessed to the murder, which  was allegedly carried out with a 12in knife.

The Deputy Inspector General of 
Kashmir Police, Ahfadul Mujtaba, said: ‘We put him in front of the 
magistrates today and we now have him in our custody for a further ten 
days.

‘He has confessed to killing the girl but at this time he is not giving any further detail.’

De Wit had arrived at the lake two 
days earlier and was staying in a separate cabin on the same boat as 
Miss Groves, a former bank worker.

She was found at around 3am  by Mr Shoda’s brother Irfan and father Abdul.

Irfan said she had desperately tried 
to phone for help during  the attack and was found lying  on her bed, 
clutching her  phone and with cuts on her fingers. He said: ‘The 
Dutchman’s  room was open. Sarah’s door was open, broken.

‘I used my torch and saw Sarah  in a 
pool of blood on her bed.  She was motionless and one of  her hands was 
in her mouth.’  Officers said they had not ruled out sexual assault 
because the victim’s clothes had been torn. After the attack, de Wit 
fled in a stolen rowing boat, which capsized.

He swam to shore and was  picked up by
police, carrying his passport and with no shoes,  50 miles away in 
Qazigund after flagging down a taxi.

Saeed's brother Irfan said the police did not send forensic officers until a day after the crime

At the time of the murder, Mr Shoda 
had gone to see friends for the weekend and Miss Groves had remained 
with his family, who said she was ‘like a daughter’ to them.

He said: ‘I wish I hadn’t gone. I 
torture myself with those regrets now. She may still be alive if I was 
here or if she had come with me. I don’t know how I can come out of this
trauma.

‘It was a very short time we were 
together but I will never forget her. She has left a mark on my life. 
She had a great wonderful soul.’

His mother Hafiza added: ‘She was a 
shy, lovely girl and called me mother in Kashmiri. Had we known the man 
had such evil intentions, we would have never let him stay. I’m 
devastated.’

It is believed that Miss Groves travelled to Srinagar two months ago, intending to stay there for just four days

On the evening before the attack, Miss
Groves shared a vegetable stew with the family in their  corrugated 
iron hut beside the houseboat.

Hafiza tried to persuade her to stay the 
night with her, but she declined, saying she wanted to speak to her 
father and read a book.

Her parents, Victor, 70, and Kate, 66,
are understood to be preparing to fly to India. Her brother Tom, 31, 
yesterday launched an online campaign to get justice for his sister, 
writing: ‘She lit up so many people’s lives.’

The attack will be another  blow to 
the Indian tourist industry after a 25 per cent drop in  foreign 
visitors since a spate of sexual assaults on women over the past few 
months.

Family: The son of the houseboat owner said Sarah had been enjoying her time with the family

In December a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was gang-raped 
on a bus in the centre of Delhi and later died from her injuries.

In March a 39-year-old Swiss tourist was gang-raped while camping with her husband in woodland in central India.

A few days later in the northern city 
of Agra, a 31-year-old British tourist was forced to jump from a second 
floor balcony when she feared a sexual assault by the owner of her 
hotel, who was trying to get into her room at 4am.

Shocked friends have left messages for Miss Groves on social networking sites.

James
Blower, a businessman in Guernsey, tweeted: 'Can't believe Sarah Groves
is dead. Such a little ray of sunshine and not a bad bone in her body. 
Taken far too young.'

The 
Foreign Office has confirmed that a British woman has been killed in 
Srinagar and that it is providing consular assistance to her family.
