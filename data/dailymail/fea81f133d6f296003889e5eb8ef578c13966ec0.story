Thief: Susan Barcock, 52, recorded the money she stole from Cancer Research UK in her diary

For most thieves, covering one’s tracks is usually the utmost priority.

But the concept was, apparently, unfamiliar to Susan Barcock as she stole thousands of pounds from the charity shop where she worked – then boasted about her exploits in a series of Dear Diary entries.

Volunteering in her local Cancer Research UK shop, the unemployed 52-year-old appeared to be a model citizen helping raise money for good causes.

But in reality she was skimming cash from the daily takings and paying it into her bank account.

She also stole thousands of pounds from an elderly widow, it emerged.

When police began investigating how money was going missing from the shop, they had only to open Barcock’s diaries to find the evidence that convicted her in court this week.

Among the individually dated entries were: ‘Good day @ shop for me. £60. So got money in bank for tomorrow & £35 to spend. Oh yes.’

Another read: ‘B***** good day at shop £213. Man brought bag of coins in – £75 for shop £35 for me, well I had to count it.’

An entry dated July 14, 2008 said: ‘A good day as far as I’m concerned. £50. But not so for shop.’

Another brazenly noted: ‘I was in charge @ C Shop and it was a good day for me £91. Oh yes.’

And on January 18, 2010 she wrote: ‘Good day in shop £124, £80 for me. Oh yes!’

Martin McRobb, prosecuting, told Warrington Crown Court: ‘When confronted with her diary, the defendant could do little more than admit to the police she had stolen this money.

‘She aroused suspicion while she was at this particular place of work but nothing had been proven. Had it not been for her personal diary entries which formed all the evidence there would have been no evidence against her.’

Sunday 13 April 2008: Dead £37 for shop £15 for me hee hee

Saturday 14 July 2008: A good day as far as I'm concerned. £50. But not so for shop.

Monday 3 Nov 2008: Good day @ shop for me. £60. So got money in bank for tomorrow & £35 to spend. Oh yes.

January 18, 2010: Good day in shop £124, £80 for me oh yes!

In total Barcock, who worked at Cancer Research UK in Warrington from 2008 to January 2010, pocketed £2,127 from the shop.

She was eventually caught out when a 
widow she had been helping around her home realised money was going 
missing from her house and bank account.

The 78-year-old victim noticed her 
bank statement showed withdrawals she knew nothing about. It emerged 
Barcock had also stolen £6,356 from her – including £2,200 in cash from 
the widow’s house.

When police searched Barcock’s home in
Orford, Warrington, they unearthed three personal diaries dating from 
2008, brazenly logging the daily amounts of money she had stolen from 
the charity shop.

Barcock was spared jail after pleading guilty to theft and false representation.

The court was told how she was of 
previous good character and had held a managerial position before she 
lost her job in 2006. She has given up her car to help pay back the 
money she stole, it heard.

Natalia Cornwall, defending, said: ‘She fully recognises the seriousness of this offence.

‘She has led an honest lifestyle but it wasn’t until 2006 that this defendant started to have difficulties in her life.’

Judge Nicholas Woodward sentenced 
Barcock to four months in prison, suspended for 12 months. She is also 
subject to a six-month curfew from 6pm to 6am and a  12-month 
supervision order.
