Disgraced minister Chris Huhne will stay out of prison for at least another week after Vicky Pryce's trial collapsed yesterday.

The Liberal Democrat is almost certain to go to jail but cannot be sentenced until a jury decides if his ex-wife perverted the course of justice by taking his speeding points.

On the first day of their trial on February 4 Huhne caused gasps of disbelief after he finally admitted the crime after years of telling ‘anyone who would listen’ - including the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister - that he was innocent.

Pryce also admits taking the points for her former husband but denies the charge claiming he forced her to do it.

Tense: Vicky Pryce arrives at Southwark Crown Court yesterday before the jury could not give a verdict so her ex-husband Chris Huhne will have to wait at least another week to hear his sentence

Huhne has been waiting to hear his fate for nearly three weeks, and is expected to be given between six and 12 months in prison.

The judge in Pryce's case was forced to dismiss the 12 jurors yesterday afternoon after expressing grave concerns that they had not understood the case or their job.

Mr Justice Sweeney said the group had demonstrated ‘absolutely fundamental deficits in understanding’.

There will now be a retrial starting on Monday, with a new jury, which is expected to last five days.

The collapsed trial lasted twice as long, but experts believe the new one will be much quicker as many legal arguments will not have to be repeated again.

After their verdict Chris Huhne will be called back to court within 24 hours and then sentenced.

The judge yesterday spoke out after the jury sent him an extraordinary list of ten questions about key aspects of this relatively simple case, which they did not understand, and said they were ‘highly unlikely’ to reach a verdict.

Jurors had reached a stalemate over the allegation that Pryce, 60, perverted the course of justice by taking her then-husband Huhne’s speeding points a decade ago.

Pryce, a former government economist, admitted taking the points but argued she was forced into it because of ‘marital coercion’.

A retired lord chief justice and a former director of public prosecutions (DPP) have called for greater research into juries following the collapse of the Vicky Pryce trial.

The ex-wife of former minister Chris Huhne faces a retrial after a jury described as suffering 'absolutely fundamental deficits in understanding' failed to reach a verdict in her case.

Former DPP Lord Macdonald of River Glaven (above) told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We perhaps ought to allow a bit more access to jury reasoning than we do.

'I think it is impossible for researchers to conduct any kind of examination at any time into what has gone on in jury rooms. In other jurisdictions under controlled conditions researchers are allowed to question jurors, to come to some conclusions about the way they are deliberating and how the process works.

'If you have a better understanding of that then perhaps it's easier to frame directions to juries that they will follow and understand.

'I don't believe this is a general problem but I do think we should allow a bit more research into the way juries go about their tasks.'

Former lord chief justice Lord Woolf told Today: 'I wouldn't rush into doing anything, I would think about it. If there was anything that might help us to be reassured about the jury, Lord Macdonald's put his finger on it.

'Some very carefully organised, responsible research may be a good thing, but it would have to be treated with great care.'

The eight women and four men retired on Thursday but remained deadlocked, even after they were told the court would accept a majority decision agreed by at least ten of them.

Their list of questions included: ‘Can a juror come to a verdict based on a reason that was not presented in court and has no facts or evidence to support it, either from the prosecution or defence?’

The question flew in the face of the jury’s oath – sworn by every juror in every trial in Britain – to try the case solely on the basis of the evidence presented in court.

Another question asked if ‘religious conviction’ was a satisfactory reason for a wife to obey her husband, because it was included in her wedding vows.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said the jurors had shown an ‘unparalleled’ failure to understand ‘very basic concepts of jury trials’. He told the court: ‘This is a jury which hasn’t, it appears, understood its function.’ 

He added: ‘I don’t recollect getting to this stage in any trial – even far more complicated trials than this – and after two days of deliberation getting a list of questions of this very basic kind, illustrating that at least some of the jurors don’t appear to have grasped it.’ 

Jurors were asked to decide if Huhne, the former Energy Secretary and MP for Eastleigh, had bullied his ex-wife into taking his speeding points in 2003.

The case hinged on the comparatively straightforward question of whether the jury believed she had no choice but to accept.

The judge gave the jury lengthy 
written guidance about the meaning of marital coercion, and said the 
prosecution had to prove its case ‘beyond reasonable doubt’.

Despite those directions, the list of
jurors’ questions included requests for definitions of both marital 
coercion and reasonable doubt.

Mr Justice Sweeney responded: ‘A 
reasonable doubt is a doubt which is reasonable. These are ordinary 
English words that the law doesn’t allow me to help you with.’

Their questions were handed to the 
judge on Tuesday but could not be reported until he decided if the jury 
should be discharged on the basis they had not understood the case.

He ruled they should be 
given further instructions in the hope they could continue and 
eventually reach a verdict, without the need for a costly retrial. They 
couldn’t.

The judge told the court: ‘After well
over 30 years of criminal trials I have never come across this at this 
stage [of a trial]. Never.’

Pryce, of Clapham, South London, showed little emotion as the judge discharged the jury.
Huhne, 58, who has already pleaded guilty, will not be sentenced until his ex-wife’s retrial has finished.

The politician has been told to be 
under ‘no illusions’ that he faces a jail term as he joins the ranks of 
disgraced MPs alongside Jeffrey Archer and Jonathan Aitken.

Of the eight women and four men on the Vicky Pryce jury, only two were white - the rest appeared to be of Afro-Caribbean or Asian origin.

At least twice, the court finished 30 minutes early because a jury member had a 'religious observance' to keep.

Despite their visibly different backgrounds, none of the 12 appeared to struggle with the English language while reading the oath at the beginning of the trial at Southwark Crown Court.

However, inability to understand written English is not a bar to serving on a jury.

The 200,000 people a year called for jury service receive letters printed in eight languages to 'encourage' non-English speakers.

It was noted during the Pryce case that many of the jurors were dressed casually.

The woman selected by the jury to be their foreman was well dressed but she was in the minority.

It was she who eventually passed a note to the judge saying the jury were 'highly unlikely' to reach a verdict.

The words 'highly unlikely' were underlined twice.

The allegations date back to 2003 
when Huhne was caught speeding and thought he would lose his licence, 
jeopardising his chances of being nominated as the Lib Dem candidate for
Eastleigh, Hampshire.

He went on to win the seat, despite 
an eventual driving ban later that year after he was caught talking on 
his mobile phone while driving.

Pryce claims he forced her to take the 
points and said he put his political career first throughout their 
26-year marriage, while she was forced to compromise her own successful 
career.

The mother of five told the court he 
had demanded she have an abortion in 1990 because it would be bad for 
his political ambitions.

She said he had also tried to bully 
her into aborting a pregnancy two years later – a pregnancy that 
ultimately gave the couple their son Peter.

Huhne left Pryce in June 
2010 after confessing to an 18-month affair with his aide Carina 
Trimingham. Pryce told the court he also had a second secret mistress.

The court heard Pryce spent months 
trying to reveal the points-swapping episode to the Press so she could 
‘nail’ Huhne, and the story broke in May 2011 in two Sunday newspapers.

The warring couple were both charged with perverting the course of justice in February last year.

Huhne stepped down from his post in the coalition Cabinet, vowing to fight the charge and clear his name.

But when his lawyers failed to get the case thrown out, he changed his plea on the first day of the trial and resigned as an MP.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
