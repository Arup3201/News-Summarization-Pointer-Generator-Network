Her face is swollen, her left eye badly bruised and her lips bloodied.

These were the appalling injuries inflicted when Stephanie Hewson was battered in a sex attack.

The assault was so violent that she was grateful just to be alive. Miss Hewson agreed to the release of the photograph in the hope that the shocking image will help in the hunt for her attacker, who is still at large nearly three years on.

Police have also released CCTV footage of the man they are looking for. Miss Hewson, 26, who was attacked after a night out with friends, waived her anonymity to describe her injuries.

She said: ‘It’s a miracle I’m still here. I had gashes all over my back, the tops of my shoulders and my head, face and jaw were swollen.

‘I had black eyes and scrapes all over my body and I had damage to the backs of both of my eyes from being kicked so many times.

‘My nose was broken and my mouth ripped apart.’ While her physical injuries may have healed, Miss Hewson is still struggling with the psychological scars.

She said: ‘Since the attack my life has completely changed.

‘I don’t go out on nights out any more, and very rarely go out at all – only to restaurants, if at all. ‘I’m scared to get out of my car to go in to work and I don’t go out at  all if it’s dark, not even to the supermarket.’

The attack happened at 2.33am on Sunday August 2, 2009 in Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, where Miss Hewson had planned to meet friends after a night out in Newcastle.

She was seen with a group outside the Envy pub in the seaside town around 1.45am before walking off with a friend, who left her at 2am.

Bay, at around 2.30am on August 2 2009

As Miss Hewson, from North Tyneside, continued walking, she was approached by a man who dragged her into a back alley and sexually assaulted her.

Police found her lying in the alley, distressed and bleeding, after receiving a report from a concerned member of the public.

Despite appeals for information and the release of CCTV stills of the suspect, police have not yet been able to charge anyone.

They have now released CCTV film of the man and are urging anyone who recognises him, or who has any information, to come forward.

The CCTV images are of a white man in his mid to late 20s, with short hair, receding at the temples, wearing a blue short-sleeved T-shirt with the word Mackenzie in yellow, dark jeans and white trainers.

Detective Inspector Paul Race, of Northumbria Police’s rape investigation team, said: ‘We carried out extensive inquiries at the time but unfortunately were unable to  charge anyone.

‘This crime has never been closed. If we receive new information we will act on it.

‘I have to praise Stephanie and her family for their courage since the incident and their support and help to officers investigating the attack.’

Miss Hewson said: ‘I think back to when I was 18 and me and my friends used to walk home late at night.

‘When this happened, I only walked four car lengths and this happened to me. It is not worth it. ‘Everyone needs to be on guard, especially when they’ve had a drink.’

Anyone with any information into the incident is asked to contact the Northumbria Police rape team on 101 ext 69191 or by ringing the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
