Mr Coan, whose home university is Occidental College in Los Angeles, told the Cambridge News, said: 'We had gone out to get some chips and about eight or nine men stopped us to ask for directions.

'I was wearing my gown having been at a college dinner to celebrate my 21st birthday.

'They started to laugh about the gown and made a remark about Harry Potter. As we walked away I was punched on the right side of my head and then again and I fell to the ground.

'My friends came to my side and then one of the group came over and just stamped on my head and broke my jaw.

'I had a black eye and a fractured jaw. It was terrible. I was taken back to the college and then to Addenbrooke’s.

'I was kept in overnight and I have been back for several appointments. I couldn’t concentrate and had terrible headaches.

'I couldn’t study for two weeks so have had to stay on in Cambridge. I have had to eat soft foods. I really think it was because I was wearing a gown.

'We didn’t approach them. It was a totally unprovoked attack. I just want them to be caught.'

Quinn Coan had donned traditional robes  as he celebrated. After the meal he went into Cambridge city centre with fellow students to carry on celebration but clashed with a gang of eight or nine local youths
