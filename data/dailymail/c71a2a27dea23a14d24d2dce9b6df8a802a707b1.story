Many of the women signing up for ultra marathons and marathons today will take for granted their right to compete. But only 40 years ago, it was not an option.

As recently as the Eighties, it was thought to be too dangerous for women to run long distances. It wasn't until the late Seventies that big city marathons began to allow women to compete. And women were not allowed to take part in the marathon at the Olympics until 1984. 

Since then, women's participation in marathons, ultra marathons, and adventure races has flourished.

Not just for macho men: A quarter of the Men's Health Survival Of The Fittest entrants are now female

One race series involving a tough army-style assault course is attracting an increasing number of female participants despite being sponsored by a men's magazine.

The Men's Health Survival Of The Fittest series is not just about males proving their strength and stamina as now a quarter of the 18,500 entrants are women.

The race, held in cities across the UK, involves running at least 10k over an urban assault course where challenges including swinging across monkey bars, scaling high walls and scrambling through mud under a net.

Jim Mee, founder of Rat Race Adventure Sports, who organises the Men's Health Survival Of The Fittest races and other endurance events, said: 'Over the past two years we have seen a significant increase in women taking part in our events.

'There could be several reasons for this increase, but in my opinion I believe that a lot of women are using endurance races and events as a target to help motivate them to lose weight, or improve their fitness.'

One of the women who has decided to take part in the obstacle course race for the first time this year is Lesley McDonald, 35, who lives in Glasgow.

No walk in the park: The obstacle course races involve scaling walls and crawling under nets through the mud

She told MailOnline: 'I have signed up for it as part of a series of challenges I have committed to doing for a year to raise money for charity whilst also getting fit. 

'I wanted a wide range of challenges, rather than just running straightforward 10Ks. I also wanted to do events where you could enter as a team, so I am doing this with a group of former colleagues.'

Despite the masculine name of the series, Lesley said she wasn't put off entering the Men's Health event in Manchester this November. 

She said: 'It has never crossed my mind that these events would be male dominated. It's great to see more women getting involved.'

Meanwhile, another of Rat Race Adventure Sports events - The Wall Ultra - is also appealling to more women.

At this year's race, which follows an off-road route along Hadrian's Wall, 40 per cent of the entrants were female. 

Up for the challenge: Lesley McDonald, 35, left, is training for a Men's Health Survival Of The Fittest event, while Sally Ford, 37,  finished The Wall Ultra Marathon

Sally Ford, 37, from Hutton Roof, in Cumbria, was the first woman to finish the 69 mile run in 2014.

She said: 'I've met lots of ultra runners/adventure racers in the last few years and I think the women are definitely tougher than the men! Once we put our minds to something we usually follow it through to the end, no matter how hard it gets. 

'We're used to juggling jobs, kids, hobbies and home life. It's often a struggle to fit everything in but I think that's what makes us more determined to finish these races. Dropping out isn't an option.' 

The women taking part in such long distance events have some inspiring role models in ultra distance runners like Lizzy Hawker and Ellie Greenwood. 

Lizzy, 37, from London, has won The North Face Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc five times and in 2013 set a new world record running from Everest Base Camp to Kathmandu in Nepal.

Meanwhile, Ellie, 35, became the first British woman to win the Comrades Ultra Marathon - an undulating 55 mile race - this year. 

They have proved that women can run for as long as men - and often at a faster pace than them as well. 

Pioneer: Kathrine Switzer campaigned for women to be able to run marathons and was the first to complete the Boston Marathon, despite race officials physically trying to stop her

Kathrine Switzer was one of the women who campaigned for the right for women to compete in the marathon. She became a figurehead for the cause after she took part in the Boston Marathon in 1967 - and organisers physically tried to remove her from the race when they realised she was a woman.

Kathrine, now 67, said of her desire to take part: 'I was just a kid who wanted to run, and was there as a reward from my coach who didn't believe that a woman could run the distance. 

'I had heard that other women had run marathon distances and that one woman in 1966 ran the Boston Marathon but without a bib number, so I wasn't trying to break any barriers. It wasn't until a race official attacked me during the run did I become determined to finish and speak out on behalf of all women.'

She did finish and went on to run many more marathons - as well as helping other women have the right to do the same.

She said joining the successful campaign to make the women's marathon an Olympic event by 1984 was her biggest 'life victory'.

She said: 'I knew when the world saw women in the most difficult of all running events, competing in the most important and prestigious sports event the Olympics it would change world attitudes about women's capability. Everyone everywhere understands that 26.2 miles (or 42.2 km,) is a long way to run, and when they see women doing it they know that women can do anything and should be allowed to participate.' 

Ten years ago, just 13 people set off together on a timed 5k run around their local park in London. 

This weekend thousands around the world will do the same thing thanks to the growth of the parkrun organisation.

Founded by Paul Sinton-Hewitt, who has been awarded a CBE for services to grassroots sport, parkruns are held across the UK and in other parts of the world every Saturday at 9am.

The ethos is it's a 'timed run' not a race - so everyone is welcome regardless of their fitness or competitiveness. Children can take part (and in some areas there are 3k junior parkruns), as can parents with pushchairs and dogs with their owners.

All the runs are free and require no pre-entry. All people have to do is sign up once on the parkrun website and print off a personal barcode to take along on any Saturday they want to take part (the barcode is how you get your time after the run). 

For many people, their local parkrun has become part of their fitness routine or started them on a journey to become a marathoner or ultra marathoner. For others, it's just a free, fun way to stay healthy -so it's no wonder ten years later, 13 has become 850,000 from Olympians to absolute beginners. Happy birthday parkrun!
