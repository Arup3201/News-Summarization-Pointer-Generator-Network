The Navy SEAL whose stunning account of Osama bin Laden’s death will be hitting bookstores next week says that his story is not intended to be political in any way.

The former soldier, who wrote the book anonymously under the pseudonym Mark Owen, revealed himself for the first time in an interview that will air on September 9.

'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed bin Laden,’ was originally slated to come out on September 11, but has since been moved up to seven days earlier.

Speaking out: Former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette appeared on US TV show 60 Minutes this week to discuss his book. CBS said they disguised his appearance for his safety

Speaking to 60 Minutes, the SEAL said that he was the second person in the room when bin Laden died, and was the one who took the pictures of his corpse.

CBS said that they disguised the soldier's appearance and voice for the interview - for his safety.

Account: No Easy Day was written anonymously under the pseudonym Mark Owen

He said that he wrote the book in honour of the men and women who helped with the intelligence gathering that led him and dozens of other Navy SEALs to the compound in Abottabad, Pakistan, where the terror boss was hiding out.

The book, he said, is not about politics.

'My worry from the beginning is that it’s a political season. This book is not political whatsoever. It doesn’t badmouth either party and we specifically chose September 11 to keep it out of the politics.'

He added: 'If these crazies on either side of the aisle want to make it political, shame on them. This is a book about September 11 and it needs to rest on September 11 - not to be brought into the political arena because it has nothing to do with politics.'

Shortly after the book was announced, the SEAL was identified by FoxNews.com as Matt Bissonnette, 36, who retired from duty last summer - shortly have the raid that led to the al-Qaeda leader's demise.

The firsthand account of the Navy SEAL raid contradicts previous accounts by administration officials, raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when SEALs first fired upon him.

Bin Laden apparently was hit in the head when he looked out of his bedroom door into the top-floor hallway of his compound as SEALs rushed up a narrow stairwell in his direction, according to Bissonnette.

Bissonnette says he was directly behind a 'point man' going up the stairs in the pitch black hallway. 'Less than five steps' from top of the stairs, he heard 'suppressed' gunfire: 'BOP. BOP.' The point man had seen a 'man peeking out of the door' on the right side of the hallway.

The author writes that bin Laden ducked back into his bedroom and the SEALs followed, only to find the terrorist crumpled on the floor in a pool of blood with a hole visible on the right side of his head and two women wailing over his body.

Bissonnette says the point man pulled the two women out of the way and shoved them into a corner and he and the other SEALs trained their guns’ laser sites on bin Laden’s still-twitching body, shooting him several times until he lay motionless.

The SEALs later found two weapons stored by the doorway, untouched, the author said.

In the account related by administration officials after the raid in Pakistan, the SEALs shot bin Laden only after he ducked back into the bedroom because they assumed he might be reaching for a weapon.

Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House

It took approximately 15 minutes to find -- and kill -- Osama bin Laden in his Abottabad compound.

Involved in the mission in the early morning hours of May 2, 2011 were 79 commandos that arrived in off in military helicopters from Jalalabad, Afghanistan.

The first helicopter foundered above Bin Laden’s compound and crash-landed in the outer courtyard.

The other helicopter landed outside the house.

The SEAL team forced their way into the compound by blowing the door with explosives.

The commandos shot three men and a woman -- whom U.S. officials said had lunged at them -- as they went up floor-by floor.

On the third level, three of the Navy SEALs saw bin Laden standing at the end of a hallway as they reached the top of the steps.

Two women in the room took positions in front of the terror leader to protect him.

One of the soldiers grabbed the women and shoved them away while one of the SEALs behind him fired at bin Laden.

The al-Qaeda boss was shot once in the chest and once in the head.

Code-word ‘Geronimo’ is sounded to White House Situation Room, a signal that their target is dead.

The SEALs then photograph the body for identification.

On their way out of the compound, the soldiers blow up the broken-down chopper.

The teams fly back to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.

Bin Laden’s body was then flown to a waiting naval ship, that buried at sea.

White House spokesman Tommy Vietor would not comment on the apparent contradiction late Tuesday. But he said in an email, 'As President Obama said on the night that justice was brought to Osama bin Laden, "We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country."'

'No Easy Day' was due out September 11, but Dutton announced the book would be available a week early, September 4, because of a surge of orders due to advance publicity that drove the book to the top of the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com best-seller lists.

The Associated Press purchased a copy of the book on Tuesday.

The account is sure to again raise questions as to whether the raid was intended to capture or simply to kill bin Laden. Bissonette writes that during a pre-raid briefing, a lawyer from 'either' the White House or Defense Department told them that they were not on an assassination mission. According to Bissonnette, the lawyer said that if bin Laden was 'naked with his hands up,' they should not 'engage' him. If bin Laden did not pose a threat, they should 'detain him.'

In another possibly uncomfortable revelation for U.S. officials who say bin Laden’s body was treated with dignity before being given a full Muslim burial at sea, the author reveals that in the cramped helicopter flight out of the compound, one of the SEALs called 'Walt' -- one of the pseudonyms the author used for his fellow SEALs -- was sitting on bin Laden’s chest as the body lay at the author’s feet in the middle of the cabin, for the short flight to a refueling stop inside Pakistan where a third helicopter was waiting.

This is common practice, as troops sometimes must sit on their own war dead in packed helicopters. Space was cramped because one of the helicopters had crashed in the initial assault, leaving little space for the roughly two dozen commandos in the two aircraft that remained. When the commandos reached the third aircraft, bin Laden’s body was moved to it.

Bissonnette writes disparagingly that none of the SEALs were fans of President Barack Obama and knew that his administration would take credit for ordering the May 2011 raid. One of the SEALs said after the mission that they had just gotten Obama re-elected by carrying out the raid.

But he says they respected him as commander in chief and for giving the operation the go-ahead.

Bissonnette writes less flatteringly of meeting Vice President Joe Biden along with Obama at the headquarters of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment after the raid. He says Biden told 'lame jokes' no one understood, reminding him of 'someone’s drunken uncle at Christmas dinner.'

Beyond such embarrassing observations, U.S. officials fear the book may include classified information, as it did not undergo the formal review required by the Pentagon for works published by former or current Defense Department employees.

Officials from the Pentagon and the CIA, which commanded the mission, are examining the manuscript for possible disclosure of classified information and could take legal action against the author.

In a statement provided to The Associated Press, the author says he did 'not disclose confidential or sensitive information that would compromise national security in any way.'

Bissonnette’s real name was first revealed by Fox News and confirmed to The Associated Press.

Jihadists on al-Qaida websites have posted purported photos of the author, calling for his murder.
