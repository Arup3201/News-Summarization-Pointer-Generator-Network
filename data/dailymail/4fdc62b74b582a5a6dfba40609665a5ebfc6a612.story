Police spied on protesters at Britain’s biggest anti-fracking demonstration, using bugging devices and infiltrating them with undercover ‘covert human intelligence sources’, an official report has revealed.

The incendiary revelation emerged only because blundering police failed to properly redact the highly sensitive report.

When a computer user changes the colour of the type, the missing text appears.

Stand-off: Police escorting a lorry confront activists from the protest camp in Balcombe, West Sussex that emerged to demonstrate against plans to frack for methane gas on a site just outside the village

The existence of ‘spies’ in  the frackers’ camp in Balcombe, Sussex, is meant to be a closely guarded secret. Sussex chief constable Martin Richards reportedly ‘went ballistic’ when told of the mistake.

A local private sector security source said: ‘Next time there’s a fracking protest, activists will know what to expect – to say nothing of the consequences if the intelligence source is discovered.’

The report into Sussex Police’s handling of last summer’s protests at the site where fracking company Cuadrilla was trying to conduct test drilling was compiled by Hertfordshire Constabulary.

Sussex Police disclosed it last week under the Freedom of Information Act, with the redactions. The error was quickly identified.

The report states that police 
initially ‘did not properly anticipate the escalation which did occur’, 
allowing the protesters to almost close down Cuadrilla’s operations in 
July. Police then used secret intelligence methods.

The supposedly redacted part of  the 
report says: ‘Once the operation moved into August, it was appropriate 
that an appropriate range of intelligence sources were being harnessed, 
including where appropriate European Convention on Human Rights 
compliant covert means.’

Clumsy: Sussex Police's attempt at redaction came unstuck as soon as activists changed the colour of the font in word-processing software

As a result, it became clear exactly when activists planned to step up their campaign.

This intelligence was shared with Cuadrilla – prompting the firm to suspend drilling on days when the protests were expected to peak.

This was ‘fully appropriate’, the report claims. ‘Not having informed Cuadrilla of the anticipated risks would have been negligent on the behalf of Sussex Police.’

Yesterday a Sussex Police spokesman confirmed that the ‘covert means’ were those set out under the Regulation of Investigatory Power Act – the use of Covert Human Intelligence Sources (CHISs) and ‘electronic interception’.

He insisted the inadvertent disclosure ‘does not compromise the operational effectiveness of our plans. We have a responsibility to gather intelligence to assess risk and build plans to keep people safe’.

But Craig Bennett, campaigns and policy director for Friends of the Earth, said he was appalled that ‘covert resources are being wasted on people exercising their democratic right to protest’.

Ugo Hayter, from solicitors Leigh Day, who are trying to stop Balcombe fracking through the High Court, said: ‘If police were using covert means, such as electronic bugging, this is deeply concerning.

'Such seemingly excessive and intrusive police surveillance only serves to undermine our democracy and is a further erosion of people’s lawful right to protest.’

Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said he had ‘no knowledge’ of the covert methods, adding: ‘This is not a matter for us, but the police.’
