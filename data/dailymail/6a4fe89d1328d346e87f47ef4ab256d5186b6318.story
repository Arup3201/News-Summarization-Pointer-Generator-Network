Kyle Naughton says he plans to follow Gylfi Sigurdsson's example in proving a Swansea hit after making the same move from Tottenham.

Sigurdsson has impressed in his second Swansea spell since leaving Spurs last summer, scoring five goals and lying joint second on the Premier League assists table with eight.

And Naughton, who swapped north London for south Wales in a £5million deal earlier this month, believes he too can reignite his career.

And the full-back is hopeful of reigniting his career with the south Wales club  

'I've watched Gylfi a few times since he's been here and he can't put a foot wrong,' Naughton said.

'Having played with him I know exactly what he can do and it's no surprise that he's come here and kicked on like he has.'

'He's playing really well and I want to thrive at Swansea like him.

'This is one of the best places to come and do that and also this style of football will suit me.'

Naughton managed only 74 appearances in five-and-a-half years at Spurs and went out on loan to Middlesbrough, Leicester and Norwich in search of regular first-team football.

His path at White Hart Lane was blocked by his former Sheffield United team-mate and England right-back Kyle Walker, but the 26-year-old is determined to prove that he can establish himself at the top level.

Naughton said Kyle Walker's return from injury meant his opportunities at Tottenham were limited

'There were rumours about another loan, but I wanted to be settled because I think you play better football then,' Naughton said.

'Spurs are a massive club, they're forever bringing players in and out and sometimes it can be a little unsettling.

'Last year I played around 30 games while Kyle was injured, but he came back into the set-up and now he's playing every game again.

'He was flying and sometimes you've got to hold your hands up but I want to prove I'm a quality player who can play at the top level.'
