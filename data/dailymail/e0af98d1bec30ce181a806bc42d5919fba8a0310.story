Juventus striker Carlos Tevez has admitted he is surprised Roma have emerged as title contenders ahead of the teams top of the table clash on Sunday. 

The Serie A rivals have both won all five league games this season and Rudi Garcia's men go into the game off the back of a hugely impressive performance at Manchester City in the Champions League. 

Something has to give when they face each other in Turin and Argentina striker Tevez revealed he did not expect Roma to be their main rivals this season.

The Argentina striker is surprised by Roma's fast start to the season ahead of Sunday's clash 

Tevez told Corriere dello Sport: 'Honestly, no, I did not see Roma as our main rivals. I did not think they were so strong. 

'This year they are closer, the gap has shrunk. Garcia has shown they can be calm in all competitions, to me they are much stronger now.'

The former Manchester City star reserved special praise for Roma legend Francesco Totti. 

The playmaker turned 38 last week and he celebrated his birthday with a brilliant goal in the 1-1 draw at the Etihad.

And Carlos Tevez warned to watch out for another Manchester City player in Maicon 

Tevez added: 'I have had confirmation of what a great player he is. 

'His quality is known to all, but what impresses me most is that at 38 years old he still has a great desire and determination. 

'It's not easy to wear the same shirt for such a long time. He really is the image of Roma. 

'But it's not enough just to stop him, he is surrounded by others. The angles found by Miralem Pjanic, the runs of Maicon and the depth provided by Gervinho.'
