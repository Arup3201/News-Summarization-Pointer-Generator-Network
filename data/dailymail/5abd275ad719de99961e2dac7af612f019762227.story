Huang Yuan, 28, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself and her son into a river in the province of Guangdong in southeast China

A fisherman raised the alarm and police were called to the scene. The woman and her son were safely rescued from the water

'But as she walked towards the riverbank it got more difficult and eventually she was up to her waist and unable to go any further.

'When her son started crying because of the cold water she seems to have changed her mind - and started shouting for help.

'A fisherman in a boat nearby raised the alarm and then when officers arrived they manage to pull the woman free.'

Mother and son were taken to the police station and the woman's husband was informed.

Mrs Yuan's husband later arrived and took his wife and child home.

According to police, the couple resolved the row during a tearful reunion at the station.

Mrs Yuan's husband insisted that he did not want to press charges against his wife.

A report has been prepared for prosecutors who will decide if they will be taking any legal action over the failed suicide.

The woman said that she had decided to take her own life after an argument with her husband. The couple have now reconciled and the husband will not be pressing charges
