With its dainty wooden ticket booths, tiled walls and rickety old trains, Budapest's M1 line must be among the world's most beautiful undergrounds. But that doesn't make it one of the friendliest.

We have committed the cardinal subway sin: not 'validating' our tickets (by inserting them into a stamping machine on the platform). The punishment? An 8,000 Forints (£20) fine.

Budapest can only get better. Thankfully it does.

A Danube delight: Budapest sits prettily on the banks of western Europe's longest river

The Hungarian capital - which divides into the hilly Buda on the Danube's western bank and the flatter, more commercial Pest on the eastern bank - has plenty of architectural splendours and cultural treasures, plus indulgent food and a lively nightlife.

The city's cheap prices - around £2 for a pint - attract stag do parties, but fortunately the local bars don't seem to specifically target these groups. We decide to see the main sights by bike and join a cycling tour run by Budapest Bike Breeze called Wheels And Meals.

Moments after meeting - and with barely a glance each way - our energetic guide, Adam, leads us full pelt into Budapest's busiest square - Erzsebet Ter.

We race around central Pest, stopping every five minutes for Adam to divulge titbits.

For example, the Opera House is reminiscent of the Vienna State Opera (though smaller, so as not to outshine the seat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and the magnificent Neo-Gothic Parliament was inspired by Westminster.

Now confident whizzing two-wheeled through the city, we speed along the riverfront.

Scenes of Hungarian life: Local men focus on the serious pursuit of chess (and try desperately not to drop any pieces) at Budapest's Szechenyi Baths (left); St Stephen's Basilica, on the Pest side of the river (right)

The sun is glistening on the Danube, cruise boats are pootling past... when I suddenly fly off my bike and crash to the ground. My boyfriend had somehow managed to wedge his handlebars under mine, thus careering me into the kerb.

More embarrassed than injured, we cross the river to the medieval town of Buda, a Unesco World heritage site.

Behind the fairytale-like Matthias Church - used as a cattle shed by the invading Turks - is Fisherman's Bastion, whose turrets provide the best views of Pest (and one of the settings for Lord Of The Rings).

After a big bowl of goulash soup at the charmingly low-key Drum Cafe, we are back in our saddles.

The final hours of our tour take in the wide boulevards of Varosliget district, Heroes' Square and the bizarre Vajdahunyad castle - with its mix of Baroque, Renaissance, Gothic and Romanesque styles.

A scene from a different era: The city's famous Hotel Astoria Cafe looks like a refugee from another century

Afterwards, we collapse into leather armchairs for coffee and cakes at the city's legendary Gerbeaud Cukraszda café.

Hungarians have a reputation for being stand-offish, but with a little persistence, seemingly frosty locals quickly warm up and keenly offer recommendations about their city.

Understandably, however, they don't readily discuss life under communist rule. And you will need plenty of energy to tackle the House Of Terror - a museum which commemorates victims of that communist dictatorship, and those of the preceding Nazi years.

With all of the explanatory text on the walls in Hungarian, an English audio guide is crucial.

Twenty-five minutes' drive away lies another reminder of Hungary's soviet history: Memento Park, the unusual home for a collection of redundant communist statues, which were torn down after the regime collapsed in 1989.

Looking from the past to the future: The historic Buda district of the city gazes across at more modern Pest

Here, avoid a guide and do your own background reading instead. The only guide on offer was softly spoken with a thick Hungarian accent and had an infuriating habit of talking as she walked away from the group towards the next statue.

Combined with the noisy gravel crunching under 20 tourists' feet and endless overhead planes, the tour was virtually inaudible.

More subtle reminders of the nation's difficult history are the abandoned Stock Exchange and National Ballet buildings, plus other crumbling structures now reincarnated as sprawling bars known as 'ruin pubs'.

At the end of a frantic weekend, we forgo these watering holes, instead treating ourselves to a soak in the 21 different pools at the Szechenyi Turkish baths. Bliss.
