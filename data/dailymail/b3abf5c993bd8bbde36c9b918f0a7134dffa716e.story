Anger: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, pictured in an expensive Savile Row suit yesterday, has sparked outrage by claiming foreign aid will help prevent flooding in the UK

A cabinet minister sparked fury last night after claiming that giving billions of pounds to the Third World would help prevent flooding in Britain.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles rejected demands from Tory MPs that the overseas aid budget be raided to help stricken areas of the West Country, claiming that the money would help curb global warming.

His claims prompted anger among residents whose homes are under water and from Conservatives, who branded the claims ‘nonsense’.

Sharon Saunders, 45, a barmaid from Bridgwater, Somerset, which is at risk of being overwhelmed by flood water, said: ‘Eric Pickles has lost the plot. Charity begins at home and we need to sort this place out before we doing anything else.

‘He needs to come down here for himself and see what it’s like before diverting money anywhere else.’

Helen Marsell, 47, a retail worker from Bridgwater, said: ‘The Government is very quick to jump on the bandwagon for aid donations when something bad happens in another country, but when a disaster strikes here their attitude is, “Oh, it’s only our country, we don’t need to worry about it”.’

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘I’m not convinced these floods are caused by global warming. But even if they were, the biggest contributors to global warming are China and America and we don’t give them aid money. It’s just utter nonsense.’

The Mail revealed on Saturday that Tory MPs are demanding cash from Britain’s £11billion-a-year aid budget is diverted to help people stricken by the floods.

But Mr Pickles rejected that plan as a ‘populist hit’ and added: ‘If it is truly global warming, then aid we’re offering in other parts of the world could well have an effect in terms of the things that happen in this country.’

Britain has already pledged nearly £2.9billion of taxpayers’ money – or around £100 per household – to a climate aid fund for developing countries over four years.

Mr Pickles yesterday offered an ‘unreserved apology’ for the failure to dredge the Somerset Levels and signalled that Environment Agency chairman Lord Smith should resign over the ‘mistake’.

Comments: Asked what he made of remarks to deploy foreign aid to help with the floods, Mr Pickles told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'Well, I think it's an easy hit, it's a kind of a populist hit'

He pointedly refused to endorse the Labour peer’s leadership of the agency, saying: ‘That’s a matter for him.’

He added: ‘I don’t see myself becoming an advocate of the “Save Chris Smith” campaign or printing “Save the Environment Agency One” T-shirts.’

Lord Smith accused ministers of ‘playing politics’ with the flood crisis.

Writing in the Guardian, he said: ‘Politicians need to realise that it’s in fact government rules – laid down by successive governments, Labour and Tory – that are at the heart of the problem.’

Ministers rushed to find emergency funds for flood-hit Somerset, but when it comes to tackling extreme weather abroad the pot is apparently deep.

Britain has pledged nearly £2.9billion of taxpayers’ money – around £100 per household – in climate aid to help developing countries over four years.

It includes £15million to help cattle farmers in Colombia practise ‘green agriculture’, such as adapting cows’ diets to reduce the methane they produce, and £14million to build wind farms and other renewable energy sources in Uganda.

When the money was pledged at UN climate talks just over a year ago, energy minister Greg Barker said it was a ‘sensible investment for British people’.

‘If we turn our back on the developing world we will see more failed states … countries struggling and failing to deal with the impact of dangerous climate change and ultimately we pay the price in British lives,’ he said.

Britain pays £140million to climate change projects abroad and further funds have been sent to countries hit by flooding, including £42.5million to Pakistan in 2011, £75million to Bangladesh in 2008 and £12million to Mozambique in 2000.
