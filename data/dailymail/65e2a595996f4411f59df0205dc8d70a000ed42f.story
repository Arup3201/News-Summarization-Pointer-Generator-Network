Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti plans to appeal the yellow card shown to Cristiano Ronaldo for diving in the area during their 2-0 win over Rayo Vallecano. 

Ronaldo appeared to be unfairly cautioned by referee Mario Melero Lopez after he was chopped down by defender Antonio Amaya inside the box.

The decision means Ronaldo is suspended for the game against Eibar in La Liga on Saturday — along with Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez, who were also booked — but Ancelotti wants the yellow card shown to his star forward rescinded.

'I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty,' Ancelotti said after the game. 

'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.' 

It did not stop Ronaldo scoring his 300th goal for the club, however, as he reached the landmark previously achieved by Bernabeu greats Alfredo Di Stefano and Raul. 

Ronaldo remained angry with the officials, however, continuing his protests at full-time.
