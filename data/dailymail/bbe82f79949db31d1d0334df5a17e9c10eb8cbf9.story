Murdered: Lee Erdmann was shot dead in front of 30 people at his local pub but none of the witnesses would identify the killer

A coroner has condemned a wall of silence protecting a vicious killer after a father was shot dead in a busy pub in front of up to 30 customers.

Gym instructor Lee Erdmann, 37, was sat at the bar mourning the loss of his baby daughter to cot death when another regular he had been talking to calmly pulled out a gun and shot him in the back at point blank range.

As Mr Erdmann collapsed to the floor the gunman then shot him again in the body with a .38 calibre revolver before repeatedly kicking and stamping on his head as he lay dying from his wounds.

Up to 30 drinkers at a 3am lock-in witnessed the shooting of the father-of-four at the Wellington pub in Salford, Greater Manchester.

Some rushed him to hospital in a car but he was pronounced dead later from 'catastrophic' injuries.

Police interviewed all who saw the shooting but despite a £50,000 olive branch and offers of being placed in witness protection programmes, all were too frightened to identify the killer and the crime remains unsolved.

Six men were arrested and released without charge.

At an inquest Bolton coroner Jennifer Leeming criticised the lack of cooperation from witnesses as she recorded a verdict of unlawful killing/

'Lots of people know what happened and who was responsible but those people are not giving evidence because they are frightened,' said Mrs Leeming.

Addressing the victim’s mother Pat, she added: 'I understand fear - I am sure you can too. But we would both also salute courage.

'Is it not frightening that someone can be brutally killed in a room full of people and no one has come forward to give evidence to bring the perpetrator of the crime to justice?

'Is that not frightening? I can 
understand fear for one’s safety and one’s family and one’s children but
it is frightening to live in a society where someone can be brutally 
killed and no one is brought to justice.

'Do we want our children to grow up in 
an area where that can happen? I would ask those who are in fear to 
think about that other fear of living in a neighbourhood where this can 
happen and then nothing occurs in terms of the perpetrator being brought
to justice.

'Think about the fear of that happening in an area where we are bringing up our children. Think about the offer that the police have made for protection to a witness who comes forward. We would salute this.

'Think about that and about the police’s successful record in protecting such witnesses. Then think again please about the other fear that this brutal terrible murder can happen in a room full of people. Think about that. I urge someone to come forward so this can stop.'

The killing in September 2011 occurred on what would have been the birthday of Mr Erdmann’s  daughter Jessica. She died of cot death when she was just four months old a few years earlier.

It is thought on the night he was shot dead he had gone out for a drink with friends as he couldn’t sleep.

Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick who is leading the investigation into the murder told the hearing: 'At 1.45am Lee got a taxi to the Wellington. He had initially gone home attempting to stay there but due to his feelings didn’t feel he could stay in the house.

'He knew there was an old school disco night on at the Wellington so it would be open. He arrived at the back door at 2am. A police officer saw him. He arrived at the back door and was let in by the landlord. It was still very busy.

'There were a few people Lee knew 
there. He spent time with one individual in particular. At 2.50am Lee 
was stood near the bar area when he sustained a gun shot injury in the 
back and while on the floor he sustained a second gunshot injury to the 
body.

'He also suffered
serious injuries to his face from blunt force trauma from being kicked 
repeatedly on the ground. Quite unbelievably there were 20 or 30 people 
there. The people responsible threatened everyone.

'It
was made very clear what would happen to them if they co operated with 
the police. No ambulance was called. A private vehicle was called and he
was taken by customers to hospital. CCTV shows he was taken to hospital
at 3.10am.'

The 
officer added: 'Greater Manchester Police has very successful witness 
protection programme and that would be in place for anyone willing to 
come forward.

No justice: A coroner has criticised the lack of cooperation from witnesses over the death of Lee Erdmann

'I would 
like to express my gratitude to Pat and her family. Murder is hard to go
through and even harder when most of Salford know who has done it. 
Whoever did this to Lee will be brough to justice.'

After the inquest Mrs Erdmann, 61, a senior care home worker was too upset to comment.

In a statement following her son’s death she said: 'Lee was very 
popular and I can only put his murder down to the fact he was a really 
good-looking bloke. All this could have been down to jealousy.

'I
just think the killer must have no feelings and no heart. I just think 
they are very dangerous to do that in front of 20 to 30 people. What 
kind of person does that? It’s not normal.

'I know people must be frightened. They must be thinking "if he can do that to Lee, he can do it to anybody".

'But
if it happened to one of their family they would be devastated. I’m not
angry with them. I know they must be frightened. If somebody did see 
it, it must prey on their conscience.'
