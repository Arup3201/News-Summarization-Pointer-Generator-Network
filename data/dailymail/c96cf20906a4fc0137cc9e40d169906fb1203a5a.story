Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is turning conventional wisdom on its head by focusing on attack to keep the club in the Premier League.

Whereas most new managers faced with a relegation fight go back to basics and prioritise defence, Pardew has spent hours on the training pitch with his young maverick strike force of Dwight Gayle, Wilfried Zaha, Yaya Sanogo and Jason Puncheon.

The early results have been impressive, with nine goals in Pardew’s three wins as Palace boss. Gayle has four of those, including a match-winning double in their comeback win against Burnley.

‘You need to do more in this league than to just defend and be disciplined,’ said Pardew. ‘We have a group of centre backs who are good talkers and organisers but the problem had been getting up the pitch and breaking down the opposition.

Burnley (4-3-3): Heaton 6; Trippier 7, Shackell 5.5, Keane 6, Mee 7; Marney 6, Jones 5.5 (Wallace 90min), Arfield 6.5; Boyd 6.5 (Sordell 90), Barnes 6 (Vokes 73, 6), Ings 7.

‘If you don’t get teams on the back foot, they will grow in confidence and grind you down. The (group of forwards) are better than they think they are. I keep trying to tell them.’

Gayle has responded, having scored only once in nine games before Pardew’s arrival, and now has double figures for the season. 

‘The new gaffer has come in and instilled a little bit of confidence in the boys so we know we can come back from 2-0 down. We are all good players and we believe in each other, as it showed.

‘It’s about making sure we’re getting crosses into the box and shots off so we can score.

‘He’s boosted our confidence as a collective. He goes out there, gives everyone little pats on the back, talks to people individually, he’s got everyone going. For me to get 10 goals this season is a great achievement.’

Burnley raced into a 2-0 lead inside 12 minutes through Ben Mee and Danny Ings before caving in just as they had done in the FA Cup at Spurs last week.

Gayle and Puncheon scored either side of half-time and Gayle popped up with a great left-foot finish after 87 minutes.

Burnley will be glad of a fortnight’s break before their next league match, another relegation game against Sunderland.

‘We need to learn our lessons,’ admitted Burnley defender Michael Keane.

‘We are normally solid at the back but we weren’t ourselves and got punished. We’ve got a couple of weeks to get over it and make sure we are ready to go for Sunderland. Our squad is not short of character.’
