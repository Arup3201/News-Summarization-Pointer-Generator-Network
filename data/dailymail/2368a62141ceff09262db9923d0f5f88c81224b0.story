Police investigating the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal yesterday questioned a fifth man.

The suspect, in his 80s and from Berkshire, was interviewed under caution on suspicion of sexual offences.

It follows the arrests of paedophile 
pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis, and 
Savile’s former producer Wilfred De’Ath. All deny any wrongdoing.

Police are investigating hundreds of allegations against the late DJ Jimmy Savile

Scotland Yard said the man questioned 
yesterday was being treated as part of the investigation that does not 
directly relate to Savile’s offences.

He was interviewed for five hours by 
officers working on Operation Yewtree.

On Saturday, police searched a 
property in Berkshire.

A Metropolitan Police: 'A man was interviewed today by officers working on Operation Yewtree has now left police premises.

'A man in his 80s, from Berkshire, was interviewed under caution on suspicion of sexual offences after attending south London police premises by appointment at midday today.

'He was interviewed by officers working on Operation Yewtree under the strand of the investigation we have termed 'Others'.

'Officers executed a search warrant at an address in Berkshire on Saturday 24 November.

'We are not prepared to discuss further.'

a national inquiry

Before today, four arrests had been 
made as part of a national investigation, called Operation Yewtree, into
alleged sexual offences by Savile and others.

Gary Glitter and comedian Freddie Starr were arrested and bailed under Operation Yewtree in the strand classed 'Savile and others'.

DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 70s were arrested and bailed in November as
part of the operation strand classed as 'others'.

Scotland
Yard is leading the inquiry and has said officers are currently dealing
with around 450 potential victims, the vast majority of whom claim they
fell prey to Savile.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
