A long-simmering volcano exploded with a series of powerful eruptions in Guatemala yesterday, prompting evacuation orders for thousands of families.

Thick clouds of ash nearly two miles high spewed from the Volcan del Fuego, six miles south-west of the colonial city of Antigua, as rivers of searing-hot lava flowed down its flanks.

Guatemala's head of emergency evacuations Sergio Cabanas said 33,000 people were ordered to leave some 17 villages around the volcano.

Explosive: The eruption looks even more dramatic at night as the volcano spews fire and lava

The ash was blowing south-south-east 
and authorities said the tourist centre of the country was not currently
in danger, although they expected the eruption to last for at least 12 
more hours.

Hundreds of 
cars, trucks and buses, blanketed with charcoal grey cash packed with 
fearful residents, sped away from the volcano along a two-lane paved 
highway toward Guatemala City.

Thick
clouds of ash reduced visibility to less than 10ft in the area of 
sugarcane fields surrounding the volcano. The elderly, women and 
children filled old school buses and ambulances carrying them from the 
area.

Non-stop: The lava spills out of the volcano and trickles down its side as the eruptions continued throughout Thursday night

Authorities set up a 
shelter at an elementary school in Santa Lucia, the town closest to the 
volcano, and by last night people had started trickling in.

Most were women and children carrying blankets and going into bare classrooms.

Miriam Carumaco, 28, arrived to the shelter along with 16 members of her family.

'We
heard loud thunder and then it got dark and ash began falling,' she 
said. 'It sounded like a pressure cooker that wouldn't stop.'

Ms
Carumaco said parents sent their children to school despite the 
darkening skies, but that classes were later cancelled and teachers 
walked them home.

The 
emergency agency said lava rolled nearly 2,000ft down slopes billowing 
with ash around the Volcan del Fuego, a 12,346ft-high volcano whose name
translates as 'Volcano of Fire.'

after it began erupting yesterday, prompting the evacuation of thousands of families

'A
paroxysm of an eruption is taking place, a great volcanic eruption, 
with strong explosions and columns of ash,' said Gustavo Chicna, a 
volcanologist with the National Institute of Seismology, Vulcanology, 
Meteorology and Hydrology.

He said cinders spewing from the volcano were settling a half-inch thick in some places.

Extremely hot gases were also rolling 
down the sides of the volcano, which was almost entirely wreathed in ash
and smoke, he added. The emergency agency warned flights through the 
area could be affected.

There
was a red alert, the highest level, south and south-east of the 
mountain, where, Mr Chicna said, 'it's almost in total darkness'.

He said ash was landing as far as 50 miles south of the volcano.

By yesterday evening, the ash plume 
had decreased to a little more than a mile high, partly due to rain, 
which diminished the potential risk to aviation, said Jorge Giron, a 
government volcanologist.

He
said ash continued to fall heavily, however, and advised residents near
the volcano but outside of evacuation zones to clean water systems 
before using them, and to not leave their homes because of the risk.

He said a red alert would be in effect until 4am local time.

Teresa
Marroquin, disaster coordinator for the Guatemalan Red Cross, said the 
organisation had set up 10 emergency shelters and was sending hygiene 
kits and water.

'There are lots of respiratory problems and eye problems,' she said.

Many
of those near the volcano are indigenous Kakchikeles people who live in
relatively poor and isolated communities; authorities said they 
expected difficulties in evacuating all affected people from the area.

Officials
in the Mexican state of Chiapas, on the border with Guatemala, said 
they were monitoring the situation in case winds drove ash toward 
Mexico.

Poisonous: Residents living close to the volcano but outside the evacuation zone have been warned to wash water systems before trying to use them because of the ash-fall in surrounding areas
