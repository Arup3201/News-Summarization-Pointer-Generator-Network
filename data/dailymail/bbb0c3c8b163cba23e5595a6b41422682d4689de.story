Puddle of Mudd frontman Wes Scantlin may have missed a Denver show if it wasn't for one die hard fan who bailed the post-grunge singer out of jail.

Scantlin was arrested after being spotted running behind the baggage carousel and 'out of the secured area through an alarmed door' at the Denver International Airport. 

The band was in town for a show at a venue called Casselman's.

Scantlin was arrested after being spotted running behind the baggage carousel and 'out of the secured area through an alarmed door' at the Denver International Airport.

9 News reports that the airport area is marked with signs that read 'do not ride carousel' and 'keep out.' 

He was taken into custody shortly after. 

Though bailed out and traveling straight from jail to the venue, Scantlin was still hours late to the stage.

'Those of you that stayed, I hope you love Puddle of Mudd [be]cause we will NEVER book them again,' wrote angry promoter Rock Panther on Facebook after the show.

Scantlin wrote a post of his own on the band's Facebook early Saturday morning seemingly in response to the incident. 

Scantlin has not yet been formally charged

'I'm here Denver! Thanks for your patience! – Wes xo'

He has yet to be formally charged. 

This is not his first run in with authorities. 

In 2013, he was arrested for reportedly vandalizing a neighbor's patio with a chainsaw.
