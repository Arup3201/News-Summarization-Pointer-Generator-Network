Actor Ralf Little has been criticised after accusing Clarke Carlisle of not telling the full story

Clarke  Carlisle became embroiled in a bizarre row with actor Ralf Little after confirming he had tried to take his own life when he threw himself in front of a lorry in December.

The 35-year-old former Premier League footballer and PFA chairman probably expected nothing but sympathy when he spoke of the battle against depression that led to the suicide attempt which left him in hospital for six weeks.

But Carlisle came under fire from his one-time friend and flatmate Little, 34, who in turn faced accusations of being insensitive to mental illness.

Carlisle was left critically injured when he was struck by a lorry close to his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64 near York.

Speaking to The Sun, Carlisle said his life had spiralled out of control after being told by ITV that he was losing his £100,000-a-year role as a Champions League pundit. He says he went straight to a casino on December 20 and blew in one night all the money he and his wife had saved. He was charged with drink-driving a few hours later.

Carlisle was due to appear at Highbury Magistrates’ Court in north London last month to face the drink-driving charge but the hearing was adjourned until next month.

‘I had to die,’ he said. ‘This wasn’t escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box.’

But on Twitter a row developed when The Royle Family star Little accused Carlisle of not telling the full story in his interview.

Little said Carlisle was going to ‘get away with it again’, referring to him as ‘Teflon’. In response to a barrage of criticism, the actor then tried to qualify his comment. ‘Seems people want context about previous tweet,’ he wrote. ‘So let me say, I know the full story and it’s not what’s portrayed in the media. That’s all.’

Little felt 'sad, and maybe a little angry' for Carlisle's wife Gemma (pictured), his children, and the lorry driver

Little and Carlisle became friends in the early 2000s, but are thought to have fallen out when the footballer took the actor’s bank card to fill Little’s car with petrol. Instead, according to Carlisle’s autobiography, he used the card to fund a drinking spree.

Little explained that he and Carlisle ‘have history’ and that while he wishes his former friend a strong recovery he does not feel sad for him any more. He said he had sympathy only for Carlisle’s wife, Gemma, the footballer’s children, and the lorry driver. Carlisle then responded using Gemma’s Twitter account, apologising once again for what had happened in the past.

But Little wrote: ‘There comes a point where it’s just frustrating to witness someone hammering the pattern of destruction for those around — and I was once one of those around — only to see the destructive force make a moving and sincere apology... then do it again.’ 

The actor had posted a series of Tweets including one which read 'Oh dear. Looks like Clarke Carlisle's going to get away with it - AGAIN'

On Christmas Day, Carlisle was admitted to a psychiatric unit in Harrogate and placed on suicide watch. He is now having counselling, with The Sun claiming the police are taking no further action over the A64 incident.

Little made the point that it was not the first time Carlisle had been charged with drink-driving — he has been banned in the past.

As a player it is understood he sometimes caused his managers problems by disappearing on drinking binges.
