Shocked: Nancy Dell'Olio said on today's This Morning that she was surprised by Sven-Goran Eriksson's revelations

Nancy Dell’Olio has revealed she's started legal action against the publishers of Sven-Goran Eriksson's autobiography.

Despite admitting she hasn't yet read the book herself, the 52-year-old Italian socialite said the contents breach a confidentiality agreement she signed with her ex-partner.

'I just started legal action against the 
publishers. He is in breach of confidential order that we cannot talk 
about certain details, so I am surprised at the publishers. It's breach of 
confidentiality,' she said during an appearance on today's This Morning.

Presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were thrown by the revelation which comes after the former England manager, 65, published a tell-all book with Headline.

In it, he claimed his nine-year relationship with Nancy had been a mistake after they started an affair while she was still married.

He said he later regretted the fact Nancy left her husband for him as, after a romantic first few months together, she became increasingly demanding and annoying.

He wrote: 'Nancy was very demanding. And it didn't take long before I started to feel a little cramped by her. She always had to be the centre of attention - and I wasn't used to this in a woman.'

He added that if they went out, she would always make a fuss complaining about anything from the lighting to the drinks.

Defending herself on This Morning, Nancy said: 'That does sound like me but he met me 
when I was with my husband, it was not a surprise. Of course I am 
demanding, if the champagne is not cold enough I will complain. Is 
anyone surprised by this?'

She added that she was 'saddened and surprised' by many of Sven's comments, including him stating that she wouldn't have been interested in him if he 'was a plumber'.

'It's funny, he was just a football manager,' she said.

Fighting talk: Nancy told Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that she has launched legal action against Sven's book publishers

She added that she expected him to have 'more style and elegance' than to write such a book but speculated it might have been due to 'financial troubles'.

She said: 'You would expect a football manager to
write about football. But people are not interested in that, that is 
the point. He had a fantastic career but why has he been forced to write
a horrible book like this and how proud he is of all the affairs he had.

'I don't recognise him completely. He doesn't sound like the person I met.'

Sven had a number of affairs while he was living with Nancy and they eventually separated in 2006.

She revealed on This Morning that the end didn't come because of his infidelity but because they fell out over her own plans to write a book.

'Is anyone surprised by this?' Nancy agreed she could be demanding as a girlfriend

She explained: 'He didn't want me to write a book but I 
told him he had no right to tell me that. I assured him I wouldn't write anything 
that was offensive. But we separated because he didn't want me to write the 
book. Of course he had to be in it because he was part of my life for 10
years.'

Nancy did keep her word and described her relationship with Sven in her book as 'blissful throughout.'

She admitted on This Morning this may have sugar-coated their time together somewhat as they had 'beautiful moments and terrible moments.'

Bitter split: The couple separated in 2006 and Nancy said they no longer speak except through their lawyers

She added that it's a shame they are no longer friends and only see one another now with their lawyers.

After they split, they fought a bitter legal battle over their former London home after she refused to move out of the £3.75million flat in Belgravia.

She finally agreed to leave the apartment in April this year after he promised her £2 million.

But it seems their legal battles are now set to continue. Sven's publisher Headline did not wish to comment.
