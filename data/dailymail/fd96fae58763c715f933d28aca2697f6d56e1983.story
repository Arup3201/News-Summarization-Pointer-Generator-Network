The 2020 general election could be the first when voting can be done online without having to visit a polling station.

A panel chaired by Commons Speaker John Bercow said online voting should be an option for all voters within just five years.

But he warned that concerns about electoral fraud and secrecy of the ballot need to be tackled before voters can be confident that the result will not be hijacked by hackers and fraudsters.

Supporters of internet voting in general elections claim it could help to engage young people, after a sharp fall in turnout.

Barely half of 18-24-year-olds voted in the 2010 election, compared to almost three-quarters of the over-65s.

Moves to make it possible to casting a ballot online in elections by 2020 would be complemented by changes in political education in schools in an effort to encourage young people to register to vote.

In an interview for the BBC Radio 4's Can Democracy Work? series, Mr Bercow said there was a 'growing appetite for online voting'.

He said: 'Now I don't mean by that that it will necessarily at any stage be compulsory to vote in that way, but I think that the notion that, if it can be established as secure and reliable people should have the option to vote online, will gain ground more and more and more.'

The planned election in 2020 'could be the first election in which people have the opportunity - they're not under any obligation - to vote online'.

Online voting has been in used in some countries around the world, but is not yet widespread

The Digital Democracy Commission, chaired by Mr Bercow, found that many people cannot understand why they could not vote online, particularly young people.

'People are used to doing their banking and other day-to-day activities online and many feel that they should also be able to vote in this way,' the report said.

'Some people said that the inconvenience of having to vote in person was off-putting and suggested that online voting would help to increase voter turnout.'

However some people highlighted concerns 'about the security of online voting and the potential for cyber attacks and hacking'. 

Labour's shadow leader of the Commons, Angela Eagle, said: 'This report suggests some interesting ways to improve our democracy and help us meet the challenges of our modern age. It is right they should be considered.

'We have to do much more to demystify Parliament and facilitate public engagement in our political process.

'Labour is committed to piloting online voting to see if it can be done securely and affordably. We will also create a new democracy portal to draw together in one place all of the things you need to know before you vote, we will make it easier to register to vote and we will reform the scrutiny of legislation to formalise a role for the public and give a greater role to backbench MPs.' 

Turnout has fallen must steeply among 18-24-year-olds, according to research of elections dating back to 1964

The report also recommended the creation of a website to allow the public to take part in Commons debates and crowd-source questions to pose to ministers.

It said MPs who are unwell or have childcare responsibilities should be able to vote in the Commons electronically, without having to go into the Chamber.

The Commission recommended ending restrictions on members of the public using mobile phones in the public galleries in the Commons and said the House should experiment with providing live social media coverage of debates.

Moves to make it possible to casting a ballot online in elections by 2020 would be complemented by changes in political education in schools in an effort to encourage young people to register to vote.

Mr Bercow said the idea of an online forum enabling members of the public to have their say in Commons debates was 'exciting'.

'For members of Parliament whilst conducting their debate, to be aware of and capable of responding to what people outside are saying, would at least start to fuse the two parts of the body politic,' he said.

'I don't know whether I would call it a chamber but the idea of there being potentially a simultaneous dialogue between chambers of Parliament and members of the public, seems to me not an idea to be afraid of at all. It's actually quite an exciting idea.'
