Cadillac unveiled its new, revamped Escalade on Monday night in New York and in addition to a slick new look, General Motors also managed to tack an inch or two onto the already hulking SUV.

GM hopes the new look and feel of the once proud king of luxury sport utility vehicles in America will help Cadillac get back its crown. They’ve also added new theft prevention technology to the $70,000 SUV.

The move comes just as the vehicle has finally shed its dubious reputation as America’s most stolen vehicle and as Cadillac sales in general begin to recover from a recession era slump.

Revamped: The 2015 Cadillac Escalade has been given a new look and some extra inches as GM looks to corner America's rebounding luxury SUV market

‘The 2015 Escalade is completely new and elevated in design and technology, inside and out. The clear objective is to once again assume the leadership position among luxury SUVs,’ said senior VP Bob Ferguson in a statement.

One way in which the Escalade is new is in size. Already one of the largest SUVs, Cadillac has added an inch and a half to both its ESV model and the standard Escalade.

According to the Detroit Free Press, sales at Cadillac have risen 29 percent this year from the first nine months of 2012. While the Escalade makes up only 12.3% of luxury SUV sales versus American market leader Mercedes-Benz’s 44.4 percent, market analysts say the 2015 model could start to tip the balance.

‘[It] leaves no doubt that the brand is staying on its course of providing a big, bold SUV to its luxury customers with no excuses. The vehicle is more powerful than ever, yet offers better fuel economy, and it is filled with electronic driver aids that should improve its already impressive safety record,’ Jack Nerad, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book, told USA Today.

Cadillac intends to aid drivers while they’re not even driving, with new theft-prevention technology designed to make sure the SUV doesn’t slide back into first place as America’s most commonly stolen car—SUV or otherwise.

Modern: The 2015 also comes standard with Cadillac's CUE system, a central touchscreen controlled command center

Refined: Cadillac also hopes to make an impact with its fine leather interiors standard on each Escalade

GM has made some superficial changes to its luxury SUV, as well. Specifically, they’ve focused on refining the vehicle’s signature deluxe interiors even further.

‘It’s a very rich-looking interior,’ Nerad said. ‘It seems ergonomically excellent, and at the same time it’s luxurious and looks rich.’

The 2015 also comes standard with the Cadillac User Experience touchscreen, heated and cooled front seats, and the market segment’s only front-center side airbag.

The Escalade goes into production next spring and is expected to MSRP close to today’s starting price of $67,970.
