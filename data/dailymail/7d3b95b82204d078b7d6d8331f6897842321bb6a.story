Frankel, the world’s greatest racehorse, bowed out in typically brilliant style yesterday, storming to victory at Ascot in his final outing.

Nicknamed ‘Usain Colt’, the thoroughbred was cheered on by a 32,000 sell-out crowd, which included the Queen, who looked positively ecstatic and held her arms aloft and cheered.

Frankel’s triumph means he has won every one of the 14 races in which he has competed. One bloodstock agent described the four-year-old horse as ‘the point to which the thoroughbred has evolved’.

Frankel, considered one of the best racehorses of all time, raced to victory in the prestigious Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot today

For many, the day belonged to his 
trainer, Sir Henry Cecil, who said the horse had sustained and inspired 
him in his struggle against cancer.

Amid emotional scenes, Sir Henry, 69, 
said: ‘He’s the best I’ve ever had. He’s the best I’ve ever seen. I’d be
surprised if there’s ever been any better.’

Frankel will now be retired to stud at
Newmarket for a second career as a stallion during which he is expected
to earn more than £100 million for his owner Prince Khalid Abdullah, a 
member of the Saudi Arabian ruling family.

In spite of the raucous crowd, which 
Sir Henry said Frankel didn’t much like, the wonder colt remained calm 
throughout the build-up to the race.

Indeed, he was perhaps too calm as he 
was slow out of the starting stalls when the race began and Ian Mongan, 
riding Frankel’s pacemaker, Bullet Train, spent the early stages looking
around to see where his stable companion had got to.

But Frankel’s 
rider Tom Queally worked hard to launch the 2-11 favourite into his 
stride and used his whip to ease him past his French rival Cirrus Des 
Aigles in the final furlong – burying prior concerns over Frankel’s 
ability to cope with soft ground.

Among the other cheering onlookers was
Princess Beatrice, a blooming Zara Phillips and her husband, rugby 
player Mike Tindall, and Zara’s brother Peter and his wife Autumn.

Frankel’s previous 13 victories 
included the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, 
the St James’s Palace Stakes and the Queen Anne Stakes. Teddy 
Grimthorpe, the Prince’s racing manager, said: ‘He’s wonderful. The 
crowd’s reaction is great – the greatest for the greatest.

'Frankel has brought a whole new generation of people to the sport.

'He’s brought a wider public recognition of the sport and he’s given them something to savour.

'He is the ultimate equine athlete. We’ve never seen anything like him.

'Prince Khalid said to me he has run 
his last race and I think that is the correct decision – he has given us
three sensational years.’
