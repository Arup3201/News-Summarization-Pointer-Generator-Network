A plan to open a new ‘Sangatte-style’ camp in Calais for UK-bound migrants was rejected by the French government last night, but ‘welcome centres’ offering advice on claiming asylum in Britain may soon go ahead.

Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve ignored the pleas of Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart for a hostel for those determined to get to the UK as a solution to the immigration crisis blighting the port.

Mme Bouchart blames Britain’s generous welfare and asylum systems for attracting a stream of migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East which have brought havoc to the streets of Calais.

M Cazeneuve dismissed the call for a base for the migrants – likened to the notorious Red Cross camp at Sangatte used by thousands as a launch pad to Britain before it was closed in 2002

Authorities are struggling to maintain order with up to 2,000 UK-bound migrants living in makeshift camps and squats around the town. Armed gangs fight for control of the best vantage point from which to break into trucks boarding ferries to Dover – on Saturday alone police found 300 stowaways hidden in lorries.

But M Cazeneuve dismissed the call for a base for the migrants – likened to the notorious Red Cross camp at Sangatte used by thousands as a launch pad to Britain before it was closed in 2002 – even before a meeting with Mme Bouchart in Paris began. He said: ‘I don’t want to create a shelter that would be a hub for migrants.

‘I don’t want to dismantle an illegal immigration network while at the same time putting the conditions in place for the trafficking to continue.’

The French minister has called on Britain and other EU members, to do more to tackle the growing problem of illegal immigration.

And last night the creation of ‘welcome centres’ offering advice to the thousands of migrants who pass through France as they head for the UK moved a step closer – with calls for them to be funded by the British Government.

Calais MP Yann Capet said: ‘There is no question of the British washing their hands of this problem.’
