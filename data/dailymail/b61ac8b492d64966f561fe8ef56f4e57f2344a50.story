It may look like a tropical paradise, but this stunning lagoon masks a dark secret... under the clear blue waters lies the biggest  graveyard of ships in the world.

In the Second World War Chuuk Lagoon was Japan's main base in the South Pacific, but in 1944, American forces launched an attack and over a two day bombardment more than 60 warships ended up on the floor of the lagoon.

Years later the Japanese still pay their respects at
 the watery graves each year, but now the site, formally known as Truk Lagoon due to a mispronunciation, offers scuba divers a chance to explore a piece of living history.

Chuuk Lagoon is a sheltered body of water in the central Pacific north-east of New Guinea - it is part of Chuuk State within the Federated States of Micronesia.

It provided Japan with a perfect natural harbour to protect its large ships and they moved their military across and fortified the islands.

They built an airstrip there and made it such a successful base it soon caught the eye of America as the 'Gibraltar of the Pacific.'

Assault: US airplanes attack the Truk Anchorage as part of the two-day attack against the Japanese

The codename for the assault on Chuuk 
Lagoon was 'Operation Hailstone' and the attack began on 17 February, 
lasting for two bitter and bloody days.

The
 American armada included five fleets carriers and four light carriers -
 they were also seven battleships, submarines, destroyers and over 500 
aircraft.

Over 250
 Japanese aircraft were destroyed - most of them had not had a chance to
 take off as they had only just arrived from Japan and were partly 
dissembled.

Remnants: The Betty Bomber sits at the bottom of the lagoon. more than 60 warships and 275 aircraft ended up on the floor of the lagoon

Depths: Several divers explore the wreckage of a sunken aircraft in the lagoon

The few Japanese aircraft that did take off were claimed destroyed -  the U.S. lost twenty-five aircraft during the attack, mainly due to the intense anti-aircraft fire from Truk's defenses.

Very few of the troops aboard the sunken ships survived - the attacks ended Chuuk Lagoon as a major threat to Allied operations in the central Pacific.

Most of the wrecks were left untouched for nearly 25 years since people feared setting off the thousands of sunken bombs.

Many of the shipwrecks in the scuba diving paradise have full cargo holds full of fighter aircraft, tanks and bulldozers.

They also have spooky reminders of human life such as perfectly preserved porcelain cups positioned next to skulls.
