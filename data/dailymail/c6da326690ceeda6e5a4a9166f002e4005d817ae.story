Ben Carson stated in an interview on Wednesday that he thinks being gay is 'absolutely' a choice. 

The potential Republican presidential candidate then used the example of prisoners to provide support for his statement.

'Because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight — and when they come out, they’re gay,' said Carson.

Ben Carson (above) said in an interview on Tuesday that he believes being gay is 'absolutely' a choice

The comments were made during an interview on the CNN program New Day when host Chris Cuomo asked the retired doctor if he did in fact believe that being gay was a choice.

Carson followed up his comment by implying that something happens to incarcerated individuals while behind bars that makes them choose to be gay.

'So did something happen while they were in there?' he said. 

'Ask yourself that question.'

He then went in on the issue of gay marriage.

'Why do gay people want to get married? Why do they say they want to get married? Because they want to have various rights -- property rights, visitation rights,' he said.

'Why can't any two human beings, I don't care what their sexual orientation is, why can't they have the legal right to do those things? That does not require changing the definition of marriage.'

For this reason he said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level, this on the same day the Alabama Supreme Court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples.

Carson is in favor of civil unions. 

Carson has long been outspoken when it comes to his opinions on gay marriage, which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech.

In an interview with Sean Hannity, Carson said; 'My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn't matter what they are.' 

He continued by saying; 'They don't get to change the definition. So he, it's not something that is against gays, it's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society. It has significant ramifications.'

The comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point Carson has come across as an affable and moderate Republican in a series of interviews.

The backlash was so strong, especially among young Americans, that Carson was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater Johns Hopkins. 

Earlier this week Carson launched an exploratory committee to run for president, becoming the first high-profile Republican candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race.
