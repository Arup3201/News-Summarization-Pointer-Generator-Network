Oscar Pistorius will be allowed to compete again despite being found guilty for the manslaughter of Reeva Steenkamp, according to International Paralympics Committee chiefs.

The Olympian and Paralympian had been found not guilty for the premeditated murder of his girlfriend Steenkamp on Thursday, but was found guilty of culpable homicide, the South African equivalent of manslaughter, by Judge Thokozile Masipa at the High Court in Pretoria on Friday. 

Craig Spence, the IPC 's director of media and communications, told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'Oscar's done a great deal for the Paralympic movement, he's been an inspiration to millions, but obviously his priority now is to see (what) the judge decides.

'Then if he wishes to resume his athletics career then we wouldn't step in his way, we would allow him to compete again in the future.'

Furthermore, IPC chief executive Xavier Gonzalez admitted that Pistorius had been a 'fundamental ambassador' for the Paralympics, but that the movement can continue without him. 

'We have been very clear in differentiating our work from what was happening in the life of one individual,' said Gonzalez. 

'That will not change with the verdict today [Friday]. The trial has not had any negative impact on the Paralympic movement.

'Since London with Sochi in 2014 we have seen an incredible growth in all aspects of our activities and we look forward very positively to Rio and Pyeongchang.

'Oscar was a fundamental ambassador of the Paralympic movement in the period between 2008 and 2012. 

'Since then the Paralympic movement has many other ambassadors and many other athletes that have been recognised globally and we believe that will continue growing as we lead up to 2016.'
