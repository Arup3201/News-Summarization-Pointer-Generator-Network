North Korea is preparing to launch a mid-range missile launch today from its east coast, officials in Seoul have claimed – hours after foreigners living in South Korea were warned to leave the country.

The chilling forecast came as thousands of North Koreans held a mass waltz yesterday to celebrate the father of madman dictator Kim Jong-un.

Women dressed in brightly coloured traditional costume danced with their partners in front of the Monument to the Foundation of the Workers' Party in Pyongyang. 

Meanwhile the Communist government issued a stark warning about the prospect of war, saying: 'We do not wish harm on foreigners in South Korea should there be a war.'

Event came as Pyongyang warned foreigners to leave the South, saying two Koreas are on verge of civil war

It added: 'The situation on the Korean 
Peninsula is inching close to a thermo-nuclear war. Once a war is 
ignited on the peninsula, it will be an all-out war, a merciless, 
sacred, retaliatory war waged by the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea).'

North Korea warned all foreigners
to evacuate South Korea yesterday because the two countries are on the verge 
of a nuclear war - as Japan set up a huge new anti-missile system in 
Tokyo.

Foreign 
companies and tourists in the South have been told to leave as Kim Jong 
Un continues to ramp up tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

South
Korean President Park Geun-hye said yesterday that she is exasperated by 
the 'endless vicious cycle' of hostile behaviour from the North. 

Japan has responded to continuing threats from Pyongyang by deploying missile interceptors in key locations around Tokyo.

North Korea has warned all foreigners to leave South Korea as Kim Jong-un's government continues to increase tensions on the Korean Peninsula

On Monday, chief cabinet spokesman Yoshihide Suga said: 'We are doing all we can to protect the safety of our nation.'

North
Korea has made repeated threats against Japan in the past weeks and there 
are fears the country, an ally of the U.S., would be in range of its 
missiles.

Japan's Defence Ministry has deployed Air Self-Defense Force's PAC-3s as a precaution against possible ballistic missile tests.

Analysts see the latest warning from the North's Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee as an attempt to raise anxiety in Seoul and believe a direct attack on the capital as unlikely.

Observers say a torrent of North Korean prophesies of doom is partly meant to win Pyongyang-friendly policy changes in Seoul and Washington and to boost the image of leader Kim Jong Un.

Last week, North Korea told foreign 
diplomats based in Pyongyang that it will not be able to guarantee their
safety as of Wednesday.

It
halted work at a factory complex jointly run with its neighbour on Monday and 75 managers from the South are preparing to return home.

Only about 400 South Korean managers remained at the Kaesong industrial complex, just north of the Demilitarized Zone today.

One manager said he and his colleagues are relying on instant noodles but plan to stay to watch over company equipment while food lasts.

President Park said the closure of the facility will scare foreign investors away from the North.

She said: 'North Korea should stop doing wrong behaviour and make a right choice for the future of the Korean nation.'

More than 120 South Korean companies operated at Kaesong and they issued a joint statement urging North Korea to reopen.

'If this situation continues, companies will face the risk of going bankrupt,' said Yoo Chang-geun, a vice president of the Corporate Association of Gaesong Industrial Complex.

After an emergency meeting on Tuesday in Seoul, representatives of the companies said in a joint statement that they hope to send a delegation of small and medium-sized companies to North Korea in hopes of reopening the complex.

The statement also appealed to South Korea to take a 'mature, embracing posture' and work out all available measures to help normalize Kaesong's operations.

Meanwhile, a shipping container was seen outside the North Korean Embassy in Ealing, London yesterday, sparking rumours that the ambassador may soon be pulled out of the UK.
