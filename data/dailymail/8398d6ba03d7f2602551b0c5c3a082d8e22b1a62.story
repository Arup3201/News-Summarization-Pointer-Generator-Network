Ever fancied owning Sir Paul McCartney's old Aston Martin DB5 or a small fleet of Ferraris?

Now you can as Britain's highest value car auction takes place next week.

But it might set you back a pretty penny with 91 of the world's most coveted classic cars expected to fetch an astonishing £25 million when they go under the hammer at Battersea auction house RM Auctions' Automobiles of London.

Britain's highest value car auction ever takes place in Battersea next Wednesday with 91 of the world's most coveted cars on sale. Pictured is the auction's most expensive lot, a 1956 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Alloy Gullwing, worth £3.2 million.

Among the lots on offer at RM Auctions Automobiles of London is this 1998 Ferrari F300 Formula One Racing car, worth £520,000

On sale for an estimated £375,000 is this 1967 Aston Martin DB6 Shooting Brake produced from 1965 to 1971

Among the dozens of motors on offer are top of the range Ferraris, Aston Martins and Mercedes expected to sell for mega money. Even a Ferrari Formula One car is up for auction and expected to fetch more than £500,000.

The top lot is a very rare 1956 Mercedes 300 SL ‘Gullwing’, one of just 29 built, and one of the most iconic cars ever.

Experts estimate the Mercedes, which has been fully restored, could fetch in excess of £3 million - PLUS a 12 per cent buyer’s premium.

British made cars will also play a huge role at the auction with 11 classic Aston Martins including Paul McCartney’s old DB5 on sale at an estimated price of £380,000.

It's not just classic cars on offer at the auction. This super rare 1926 Brough Superior SS100 Alpine Grand Sports is worth £300,000, one of 226 Brough Superior bikes produced that year

A 1967 Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman Limousine, worth £120,000 is up for grabs. Famous owners of the 600, though not necessarily this model, include Coco Chanel, Elizabeth Taylor and John Lennon

This stunning white 1952 Bentley Continental R-Type Fastback Sports Saloon by H.J. Mulliner & Co. could be yours for £675,000

On top of that, there are also 11 Ferraris going under the hammer including a pristine 250 GT LWB ‘Tour de France’ with a £2.4 million guide price.

This year has seen the classic car market continuing to show itself as an excellent prospect for investors with values of the finest motors up almost 19 per cent.

Dietrich Hatlapa, from The Historic Automotive Group Index (HAGI), which monitors values in the classic car market has seen values skyrocket 63 per cent over the past five years.

He said: 'Classic cars have been doing very well recently and this year there has been a double-digit increase in value.

'The increase doesn’t apply to all old models, but rare cars which are technically interesting and have a racing pedigree are doing well.

Beatles legend Sir Paul McCartney's old 1964 Aston Martin DB5 is on sale and is worth £380,000

Pictured is a 1959 Ferrari 250 GT LWB Berlinetta 'Tour de France', worth £2.4 million, named after the 10-day Tour De France automobile race and not the bicycle event of the same name

This 1991 Citroen 2CV6 Charleston, is a snip at a mere £10,000. Versions of the 2CV were created by the French manufacturer from 1948 onwards

A real classic, this 1930 Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 GS Testa Fissa, is expected to be sold for £900,000

'But it is important to say though that the market is still dominated by enthusiasts rather than investors.'

Some of the most interesting lots for sale at RM Auctions' Automobiles of London include:

Mr Hatlapa added: 'The Mercedes Gullwing, for example, is likely to sell considerably more than a normal Gullwing because it has an alloy body and there were just 29 made compared to more than 1,000 of the standard bodied cars.'

The Battersea sale takes place on Wednesday with enthusiasts from all over the world expected to queue up to pay the £100 entry fee.

This gets entry for two and a copy of the coffee table-style glossy book which lists every model from a £10,000 Citroen 2CV to £675,000 Bentley Fastback.

Max Girardo, managing director, RM Europe said: 'The broad selection of marques and values represented in this year’s London sale is what really sets it apart from other collector car auctions.

'RM always succeeds in bringing together some of the world’s finest automobiles, and this year we have a large number of lots that represent a broad cross section of the collector car market and which have been drawn from every corner of the globe.

'This international capability is what really sets us apart in the marketplace.'

Last year, the auction house sold 79 per cent of its 125-strong lot with sales totaling £13.3 million.

In 2010, they managed £19.1 million with the Aston Martin DB5 driven by James Bond in Goldfinger selling for £2.9 million.
