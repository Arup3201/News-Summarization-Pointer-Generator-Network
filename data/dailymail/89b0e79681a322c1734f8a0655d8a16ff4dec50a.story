A woman digging foundations for a conservatory has discovered two headless skeletons in the house's back garden. 

Claire Wheeler was helping her parents with work at their home when builders found bones beneath the grass at the property in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. 

The remains, thought to be 150-years-old and of two adults, have been passed on to archaeologists at Anglia Ruskin University for analysis.  

Builders discovered the bones, thought to be 150-years-old, when digging foundations for a conservatory at the house in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire 

Claire Wheeler, whose parents live in the house, said it was 'quite a shock' to find the bones buried on her doorstep 

'It was a bit of a shock. We were digging the foundations for a new conservatory and then we found these human remains,' said Mrs Wheeler. 

'They haven’t found the skulls yet, which is a little bit worrying.' 

The house was built by Mrs Wheeler's great-grandfather in the 1930s and are thought to have been in the grounds of a Georgian house. 

Her father, Robert Russell, said: 'Huntingdon is a very old town, at least 2,000 years, it’s always been a river crossing and Roman remains have been found previously.

'We don’t think these bones are Roman but we know a house once stood were these two houses are today, there is still the Georgian wall around the area.

'I’ve spoken to the county council archaeologist and he said there used to be up to 16 churches in Huntingdon but there are no records of the site being a graveyard.

The site is not thought to have ever been a graveyard though may once have been set in the grounds of a large Georgian house 

The 30-year-old and her family have been told to halt construction until analysis of the skeletons is carried out 

Cambridgeshire Police said the discovery is not being treated as suspicious. Officers were joined by a Cambridgeshire County Council forensic archaeologist at the home after the skeletons were found 

'Luckily the bones are old so there’s no suggestion grandfather was involved, he was worked as a chemist in the town.'

A spokesman for Cambridgeshire Police said: ''The bones, which are believed to be of two adults, have been taken to Anglia Ruskin University for further analysis by forensic archaeologists.

'A forensic archaeologist from Cambridgeshire County Council was due to attend the property.

'The discovery is not being treated as suspicious.'
