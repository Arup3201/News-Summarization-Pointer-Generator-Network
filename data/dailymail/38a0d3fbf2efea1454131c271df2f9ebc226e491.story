A news director at a Minnesota Fox affiliate resigned Monday after penning a Facebook post about a “drunk, homeless, Native American” who last week wandered into his yard, smiled, and then flashed him the peace sign. 

Jason Vincent, formerly of KQDS Fox 21 in Duluth, wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday night: 

'Add drunk, homeless, Native American man to the list of animals that have wandered into my yard … Then he proceed (sic) to wave at me and give me the peace sign when he spotted me in the window. Wow …'

He said what? Jason Vincent, former news director at a Minnesota Fox affiliate, got into hot water for labeling Native-Americans 'animals' in a Facebook post

A screen grab of the unfortunate update was re-posted on the Fond du Lac People’s Forum, a second Facebook page that invites area residents, and specifically Native-Americans, to voice opinions on one topic or another.

Vincent did not return phone calls to area reporters covering the story, but issued an awkward apology in which he confessed, 'I myself am Native,' too.

'I have deleted the post and I certainly understand why it’s being taken out of context and viewed as offensive,' he wrote in his apology.  'I would never insult the Native American community, especially since I myself am Native.

'I did not realize how poor the choice of words were I used until I looked back and saw what I had posted. I sincerely apologize for my words and to anyone offended by them.'

“Add drunk, homeless, Native American 
man to the list of animals that have wandered into my yard … Then he 
proceed (sic) to wave at me and give me the peace sign when he spotted 
me in the window. Wow …”

Vincent was a reporter and anchor in Fargo before he was hired as Fox 21’s news director in early 2010, according to The Duluth News Tribune.

A public furor followed the original post and Vincent's subsequently strained mea culpa.

Notably, Duluth’s American Indian Commission and the Human Rights Commission issued a joint statement demanding an on-air apology and that the station’s staff complete an educational workshop on racism.

'As a white man in a position of power, he contributes to our thinking and structures of stereotypes, images, metaphors and emotions,' the joint statement reportedly said.

'This is an opportunity for the community to be further educated on issues of race in Duluth, and we hope that there comes growth from this incident.'

Quick Action: Following Vincent's gaffe, Fox 21 in Duluth first required the beleaguered newsman to issue an apology on its own Facebook page, then forced him to resign his post

Brian Flick of St. Paul was one of the first of many to comment on Vincent's by-now-viral status update.

'It made me upset,” said Flick, according to The News Tribune. 'It’s a racist comment.'

Meanwhile, Rob Peacock, another commentator, said he was equally offended by Vincent's characterization of Native-Americans as 'animals.'

Damage Control: The Fox affiliate aired its statement about 10 minutes into Friday's 6 p.m. broadcast; the station manager apologized for Vincent's gaffe

'What he (said) didn’t hurt me,' Peacock reportedly noted. 'It did hurt other people. A lot of people, (but) they kind of expect that stuff. And even me personally. I’m a light-skinned native and I’ve heard a lot of comments about natives.'

Peacock told The News Tribune that many northern Minnesotans could use cultural sensitivity training and that Vincent’s controversial status update could serve as a flashpoint for a productive conversation about racism.

'It gives us a moment to talk about it,' he said. 

'I have deleted the post and I certainly
understand why it’s being taken out of context and viewed as 
offensive. I would never insult the Native 
American community, especially since I myself am Native.'

Vincent had reportedly been news director at Fox 21 since 2010, but began his career as an anchor at KEYC-TV in Mankato, another Minnesota town.

Before coming to Fox 21, he was an anchor and reporter for WDAY-TV in Fargo, according to The News Tribune.

In announcing Vincent's resignation - it wasn't clear whether he resigned of his own accord or was forced out - Fox 21's general manager, Jackie Bruenjes, wrote, 'Jason has elected to take a new job assignment.'

In closing, the terse, three-sentence statement added, 'We wish Jason the best.'
