With its clear azure sea and lush palm trees, the town of Rabaul on East New Britain Island in Papua New Guinea should be a gorgeous slice of tropical paradise. But as these incredible photos reveal, that couldn't be further from the truth. 

Once a thriving holiday destination, Rabaul was left virtually empty when, 20 years ago, Tavurvur, Vulcan and Rabalankaia, three volcanoes on the edge of town, erupted - smothering the town in layers of volcanic ash and scalding lava.

But despite the risk of further eruptions and the grim landscape, described by photographer Eric Lafforgue as 'Hell on Earth', some families, too poor to move, have been left to scratch a living in the rubble, while their children play in the scarred, otherworldly landscape left behind.

Bleak: A little boy sits on a hillock covered in grey ash and stunted grass just outside the ruined town of Rabaul in Papua New Guinea's East New Britain Island

Dangerous: Soft clouds of falling ash are a daily hazard for families living in the area, many of whom go on to develop respiratory diseases as well as lung cancer

Abandoned: For 10-year-old Ben, the abandoned town is the perfect playground while, right, many of the apartment blocks are now derelict and visited only by animals

Beautiful: With its azure waters and golden beaches, Rabaul ought to be a tropical paradise but as this photo reveals, its three volcanoes have covered it in ash

'Over 30,000 people left the town itself and a further 50,000 ran from the surrounding area,' explains Lafforgue. 'Only four people lost their lives in the eruption, although one other was killed by a lighting strike on the southern flank of Vulcan.'

Those who remain spend their days hunting for eggs laid two metres below the top layer of ash by the megapode bird or eking out a living by sweeping up ash or guarding the derelict remains of the town's hotels.

Many lost their homes during the 1994 eruption and have moved into other, less damaged, properties although like everyone else who lives near the volcanoes, they run the risk of developing respiratory diseases and lung cancer as a result of the ash cloud.

One man who knows only too well what the volcano can do is former deputy mayor, Mr Jewakauckesa. His wife was one of those killed during the explosion and his son has moved to another town, so now he lives alone in his tiny house in the shadows of Tavurvur.

Devastating: Former deputy mayor of Rabaul, Mr Jewakauckes, lives alone in front of Tavurvur, which he has done ever since his wife was killed in the 1994 eruption

Scratching a living: Although Ben loves living in the volcanic wasteland, his father has to eke out a living as a security guard protecting abandoned hotels from looters

Dangerous job: Megapode birds lay their eggs two metres below the surface of the volcanic sands and the locals make money by digging them up and selling them

Dirty job: Getting to the megapode eggs requires hours of digging but once collected, the eggs can sell for up to 60p ($1) each at market

Risky: Like others working close to the three volcanoes, egg collectors risk a close encounter with scalding ash and also respiratory diseases and lung cancer

Tradition: Locals who remain in the area have clung on to their traditions, among them the Tubuan Dance which is performed wearing huge Duk Duk masks

Dowry: To marry, locals pay a dowry in the form of shell money - 400 of these huge hoops are usually required, which involves collecting thousands of shells

Strange world: Most of the people living in the area have homes in villages outside Rabaul and away from the volcanoes and the ash cloud, like this father and son

Fire dance: The Baining fire dance is performed by tribespeople living around the volcanoes and includes dancing over live coals to mimic the look of an eruption

'He has stopped buying cars because they stop working after two years thanks to the ash,' adds Lafforgue. Others still living in the ruins include 10-year-old Ben, whose father works as a security guard for one of the ruined hotels.

'He enjoys the place,' says Lafforgue. 'It's like a giant playground for a child because there's no cars to worry about and plenty of sand and dust to roll about in.'

Other children play on the wrecks of World War Two era Japanese, British and US tanks, which lie encased in ash among the rubble and date from the Japanese occupation that began in January 1942.

Not long before that, the town had been rocked by yet another eruption that killed more than 500 people, although later planners chose to ignore the ominous rumblings from the volcanoes, even building an airport at the base of Vulcan.

'The airport was directly in the path of ash and lava from the nearby vents,' explains Lafforgue of the airfield, which now lies buried under tonnes of molten lava. 'Nobody knows why they built it at the foot of the volcano - it was a very strange thing to do, given the previous eruptions.'

Hidden:
 Although the Karavia Tunnels were relatively untouched by the eruption,
 the catacombs, and the Japanese landing craft within, have been 
abandoned

Barren:
 Following the explosion in 1994, ash and lava rained down on the town 
and surrounding area leaving a pock marked blasted wasteland behind

Bad
 idea: This pool of molten lava and volcanic ash is all that remains of 
Rabaul's airport which was built at the foot of Tavurvur and was 
completely destroyed in 1994

Explosive:
 Since the 1994 eruption, the volcanoes have continued to emit huge 
clouds of ash which can be seen all over East New Britain Island

Barren:
 This area was once known as Mango Avenue but thanks to the 1994 
eruption, all the fruit trees have been burned and nothing now grows

Also destroyed in the 1994 eruption were the townsfolk's fruit trees, with one plantation - formerly known as Mango Avenue - now a wasteland of charred branches and solidified ash.

Nevertheless, some of the traditions do remain, among them the Baining dancers from the local Tolai tribe, who wear giant masks that are never seen during the day and jump into the fire, kicking the ashes as they go.

The Tolai also retain their custom of charging a bride price payable in 'shell money', which is made from hundreds of delicately polished pieces of mother of pearl, and are the only remaining Papua New Guineans to perform the 'Tubuan dance' which they do wearing enormous Duk Duk masks.

But while the locals do their best to cling on to their traditions, few are still around to enjoy them and with another eruption expected in 2050, that small number could soon be reduced to none.

Filthy
 job: The best paying job in Rabaul is that of street cleaner with 
regular sweeping required to keep the ash spewing from the volcanoes 
from smothering the town

Smothered: So thick is the ashy layer on homes, 
fields and businesses, it has caused 80 per cent of the buildings in the
 area to collapse under its weight

Buried:
 Thanks to the 1942 Japanese occupation, Rabaul is home to scores of old
 tanks, in this case an American one, which now lie buried beneath heaps
 of ash

Blighted: The only remaining hotel in Rabaul 
specialises in volcano views (left) while even the opposite side of the 
bay from Rabaul is blighted by the ash cloud (right)

Deadly:
 Tavurvur, Vulcan and Rabalankaia last erupted in 1994 but have 
continued to emit ash clouds ever since and are scheduled to erupt again
 in 2050

The town of Rabaul in Papua New Guinea sits beneath three active volcanoes: Tavurvur, Vulcan and Rabalankaia

@highlight

Volcanoes last erupted in 1994, smothering the town with lava and ash, and continue to emit ash clouds today

Although the majority of inhabitants fled in 1994, a handful still remain and scratch a living from egg collecting

Because of the ash cloud, they are at risk of developing respiratory diseases and even lung cancer

Previous eruption was in 1937 and killed 500 people and the next is expected to come in 2050
