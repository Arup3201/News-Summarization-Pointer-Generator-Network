Attorney-General George Brandis has had a bad day at the office after delivering a 'train wreck' of an interview on Sky News about metadata and the role it will play in the Federal Government's data retention policy.

During an interview with journalist David Speers on Wednesday, Mr Brandis struggled to outline the government proposal which would require telecommunication companies to keep track of what customers did on phones and the internet.

This data would be logged for two years and would be used by Australian law enforcement, anti-corruption and national security agencies to investigate crimes without a warrant.

George Brandis struggled to explain to Sky News' David Speers what data the government would be collecting in a new proposal

Mr Brandis’ appearance on Sky News followed an earlier interview Prime Minister Tony Abbott did with Channel Nine breakfast show Today, where he used a postal analogy to explain metadata.

‘It’s not the content of the letter, it’s what’s on the envelope,’ Mr Abbott said.

‘It’s not what you’re doing on the internet, it’s the sites you’re visiting.

‘It’s not the content, it’s just where you’ve been so to speak.’

Tony Abbott appeared on Channel Nine earlier to also explain what information the government would be collecting as part of its data retention policy

But later the prime minister’s office told The Sydney Morning Herald internet browsing history was not metadata.

To add further confusion - after he was repeatedly asked to clarify what information would actually be captured - Mr Brandis told Sky News: 'What you're viewing on the internet is not what we're interested in...what the security agencies want to know, to be retained, is the electronic address of the website that the web user is visiting.'

But then he went onto to admit the data collected under the proposal would include the website.

After clarification, Mr Brandis explained that the sites visited by a browser would be retained, but not the content that was viewed on the site.

According to the Attorney-General's office, metadata is 'information that allows a communication to occur' - including IP addresses

Within minutes of the Attorney-General's stumble, Twitter users were relentless in their criticism of Mr Brandis, with @dfg77 labelling the interview a 'train wreck'.

'Brandis has no idea what he’s talking about on data retention. A train wreck of an interview,' he posted.

iiNet chief regulatory officer Steve Dalby could not hide his feelings either about Mr Brandis' explanation of his office's new proposal.

'Completely clear. As mud,' he tweeted.

According to the Attorney-General department's data retention proposal, metadata is 'information that allows a communication to occur' - including IP addresses, the number used to call or text, and time and date of when the communication occurred.

But metadata does not include 'information relating to a person’s web browsing or thecontents or substance of their communications'.
