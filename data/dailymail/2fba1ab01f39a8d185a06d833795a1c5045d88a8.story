Under-pressure Brighton boss Sami Hyypia is desperate for his side to turn their season around against fellow strugglers Millwall on Friday night.

The Seagulls, who reached the play-offs in the previous two campaigns, have dropped into the relegation zone following a wretched run of just one win from their last 16 matches.

But facing them will be a Millwall side in similarly rotten form, having won once in 15 outings to lie just two places and two points above their opponents.

Brighton boss Sami Hyypia is hoping his struggling side can turn things around against Millwall on Friday

The former Liverpool defender Hyypia said: 'Everyone knows it is an important game and everyone knows we need to turn the corner quickly. We can start to do that on Friday night.

'The atmosphere has been very positive. It's an important game but I don't expect anything less from the players than in any other game. Everyone has to go onto the field to do everything to help win the game.' 

Hyypia is expecting a battle against a side very much in the mould of his opposite number, Ian Holloway.

'They are a team about which the manager tells you everything. The team has the same character as the manager," he added.

'He is giving everything he can and they will come here to fight and try to get something from the game. We need to win the fight and then hope our quality will win the game.'

While Brighton slipped to a 3-0 defeat at Derby last weekend, Millwall were having an even more miserable afternoon as they crashed 5-1 at home to Middlesbrough.

Goalkeeper David Forde is hoping that humiliation will be a watershed in a disappointing season so far.

'We were all bitterly disappointed after that game and maybe one or two harsh words were said because that wasn't a Millwall performance in the first half,' said Forde. 

'But I've experienced that sort of thing before, when we suffered heavy home defeats to Watford and Birmingham under Kenny (Jackett). On those occasions we knuckled down and bounced back, and with the character in this squad I fully expect us to do the same again.

'We have the opportunity to put the memories of Middlesbrough firmly behind us by going to Brighton in front of the Sky cameras and showing what we're really capable of.

'I still haven't been on the winning side at their new stadium, so this would be the perfect time to rectify that.'
