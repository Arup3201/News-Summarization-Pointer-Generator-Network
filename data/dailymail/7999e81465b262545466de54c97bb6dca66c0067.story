Refugees from countries such as Syria and Afghanistan and people migrating for economic reasons often pass through Turkey while trying to reach Europe by sea or land

Colonel Sakir Cicek, of the Turkish military's general staff command in the capital, Ankara, said the people on board were believed to be from Afghanistan and Syria. He said it was unclear where the vessel had set sail from.

Emrecan Kolcu, one of the fishermen involved in the search and rescue operation, said he headed to the area when another fisherman radioed that he had seen a body in the sea.

"We saw dead bodies," Kolcu said. "It was not possible not to see them, anyway. Everywhere was full of dead bodies. They had life vests on them."

The Istanbul governorship office said the boat had issued a distress call early this morning about three miles north of the Bosphorus Strait in the Black Sea.

Seven coast guard vessels, a team of divers, one helicopter, two police vessels and numerous fishing boats were assisting in the search-and-rescue operation.
