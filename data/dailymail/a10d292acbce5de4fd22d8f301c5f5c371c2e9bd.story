'Significant discount': Mr Cohen said he could earn twice as much money at a commercial channel

One of the BBC's highest-paid executives last night defended his huge pay packet and said that his £320,000 licence fee-funded salary was at 'a significant discount'.

Danny Cohen, the Corporation's Director of Television, even said that he could earn twice as much money elsewhere.

His comments came as news leaked that youth channel BBC Three, which he was once in charge of, would be pulled off air to make savings of £65million.

Mr Cohen, who was the Controller of BBC Three and BBC One before being given control of the entire television output, is responsible for shows including The Voice, Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who.

While in charge of BBC3 he was criticised for commissioning ‘trashy’ shows including Snog, Marry Avoid and Hotter Than My Daughter.

Speaking at a fundraising event for charity World Jewish Relief, he said: 'The executives continue to be well-paid, 
but if we went to commercial organisations we'd be paid roughly double.

'So we take a significant discount on what we would make if we were 
working in commercial organisations.'

Mr Cohen also attacked recent Press investigations into the cost of BBC senior management, saying a report by the Sunday Times suggesting that 82 senior staff earn in excess of £150,000, was inaccurate.

'We've reduced our senior management bill very considerably', he insisted.

Plans for cutting the channel were fleshed out today, as director-general Tony Hall said it is 'the right thing to do'.

The channel will be replaced with a BBC1 +1 service and many of its shows will be also be shown on BBC1 and BBC2.

£450,000 : Tony Hall, Director General

£395,000 : Anne Bulford, Managing director of finance and operations  

£340,000 : James Harding, Director of news and current affairs

£320,000 : Danny Cohen, Director of television

£320,000 : Lucy Adams, HR director

£295,000 : James Purnell, Digital and strategy director

In an email to staff, Mr Hall said: 'I believe it’s the right thing to do: young audiences - the BBC 3 audience - are the most mobile and ready to move to an online world.

'Twenty-five per cent of viewing by 16 to 24 year-olds is to catch-up or other screens and over the next few years we expect that to reach 40%.'

Mr Hall said he could not 'rule out' further changes to 'programmes or services'.

In the same announcement, Mr Cohen said the move was 'the biggest strategic decision the BBC has made in over a decade'.

He added: 'In an ideal world we would not be making this move for a few more years. Given an entirely free hand, I would make this change in about four or five years’ time, using the years between now and then to slowly shift the balance between linear and on-demand BBC3 content.

'That would be a safer, less risky strategy. But we don’t have the choice to wait and do that due to the investments we need to make.'

Little Britain was one of the programmes which started on the channel and went on to become a huge success

The channel has been known to air a number of programmes with provocative titles, including Snog Marry Avoid?

Meanwhile, BBC stars have also threatened to start a campaign against the closure.

Yesterday, Radio 5 Live presenter Richard Bacon threatened to stage a similar campaign against the proposed BBC3 cut to the one that saved the future of BBC digital radio channel 6Music.

He said: ‘BBC3 makes lots of great, clever, distinct programmes. If the rumours of it being cut are true, we might need to retool that 6Music campaign.’

Comedian Russell Kane, who regularly presents the BBC3 show Live at the Electric, claimed the channel was the ‘crucible of upcoming comedic artists’.

Presenter Greg James, who also regularly appears on the channel, said: ‘Such a load of balls if the rumours about BBC3 being axed are true. Brilliant new comedy and live music needs that platform.’

Despite the protests of BBC staff, others have supported the proposal and expressed relief that Lord Hall will at least save BBC4, which has also been under threat.

Plans: Director General Tony Hall today confirmed plans to pull BBC3 off air

The high-brow station, which has an older audience, had been seen as the other main contender for the axe.

On the BBC’s online message board, Points of View, the overwhelming majority of viewers said they would prefer BBC3 to be scrapped rather than see BBC4 disappear.

One said that BBC4, which mainly broadcasts documentaries and arts programmes, is ‘too good to go’, while another added: ‘BBC3 should go. Its programmes are pretty puerile.’

BBC3 was set up in 2003 and has launched comedies such as Little Britain and Gavin and Stacey.

But other programmes, such as Snog, Marry, Avoid?, have been less popular with critics, and it has been accused of showing endless repeats of EastEnders and films.

Its viewing figures are also much lower than other BBC channels, rarely topping 800,000, while its target audience of 16- to 34-year-olds watch more online television than older viewers.

Responding to Mr Cohen's comments, a BBC spokesperson said: 'We have reduced senior managers’ pay bill by more than 30 per cent since 2009.

'The BBC has a policy of discounting executive salaries by between 50 to 80 per cent against the commercial sector.'

BBC Three started broadcasting in 
2003 and has been the launch pad for some of the corporation's biggest 
shows, along with some of its most controversial.

THE HITS

Gavin and Stacey
 - The sitcom story of an Essex boy and a Welsh girl's relationship 
started on the channel in 2007 before moving over to BBC1 where it 
became a massive mainstream hit and made stars of writing and acting duo
 Ruth Jones and James Corden.

Little Britain
 - The sketch show and its stars, David Walliams and Matt Lucas, made 
two series before moving over to BBC1 and even inspired an American 
version Little Britain USA.

Our War - The documentary, which used footage filmed by British soldiers on the front line in Afghanistan, won a TV Bafta last year.

THE MISSES

Anthea Turner: Perfect Housewife - The show which starred the former daytime TV favourite helping make hopeless housewives house-proud ran for three series.

Coming of Age
 - The BBC described the comedy as a 'frank look' at teenage life, but 
some people could not bear to look, with one critic calling it the 
'worst sitcom ever'.

Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents
 - The show followed teenagers on their first holidays without their 
parents, who were in fact following their every move with secret 
cameras. One newspaper accused it of blazing a 'vomit-flecked' trail for
 subsequent shows.
