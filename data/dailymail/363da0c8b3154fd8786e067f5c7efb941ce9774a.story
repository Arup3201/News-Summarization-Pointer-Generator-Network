After saving their first kiss until after their wedding, it seems as though newlyweds Jessa Duggar and Ben Seewald are eager to make up for lost time.

Jessa, 22, shared a candid photo of her husband Ben, 19, gently kissing her cheek on her Instagram account on Friday afternoon, just a few days after posting a picture of the duo sharing a much more passionate embrace.

The devout Christian couple, whose strictly-governed courtship has been documented on the hit TLC series 19 Kids and Counting, married in front of more than 1,000 guests and the First Baptist Church in Bentonville, Arkansas on Saturday.

Up until the ceremony, the pair had only been allowed to see each other while in the presence of a chaperone – while any physical contact between them was limited to sideways hugging and hand holding.

Ben and Jessa waited until they were alone to kiss for the first time - unlike Jessa's older sister Jill and her husband, Derick Dillard, who puckered up in front of family and friends during their wedding ceremony in June.

The sweet photo has already garnered more than 50,000 likes from the 19 Kids and Counting stars' fans.

On Wednesday, Jessa shared another snapshot that showed her and Ben locking lips, with the caption 'It's great living life with your best friend!'

While the young couple clearly believe that patience is a virtue, rumors have emerged that they consummated their marriage mere hours after tying the knot.

According to an alleged wedding guest by the name of 'Mary B', Jessa and Ben were busted by sister Jinger, 20, in a closed room, in the act of 'lust' at the reception in the Arkansas church where they had just been married.

'Multiple people were discussing that when Jinger opened the door to get Jess for the reception, she immediately closed the door with a look of shock on her face,' Mary B wrote on the Christian fundamentalist blog, My Life As A Stay At Home Wife And Mom.

Whether or not 'Mary B' actually attended the wedding, or whether the blog post is a hoax is unclear, but she did mention that her daughter 'knows the girls from Journey to the Heart' - a local religious event.

Pastor Mike Schadt, who performed the wedding ceremony, told People that it was important to both Jessa and Ben for their first kiss ever to be in private.

'It was their desire they would share this unique and precious time intimately alone, so just respect that,' Pastor Schadt reportedly told the crowd, when Ben and Jessa left the altar.

Short engagement: Ben proposed to Jessa on August 14, after 11 months of dating, and the pair married on November 1

'It is very untraditional not to kiss onstage, but I can tell you they are smooching now. The fact they want to do it alone is very precious,' he added.

Ben reportedly wiped away a tear upon seeing Jessa in her blush-colored wedding gown, from Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

Ben proposed to Jessa on August 14, after 11 months of dating. Shortly after, she changed her Instagram handle to Jessa Seewald, taking Ben's last name.

Their courtship was arranged by Jessa's father, Jim Bob Duggar. Fans will be able to watch the pair's wedding on the next season of TLC's 19 Kids And Counting.
