With a fresh wave of tension over the threat of Russian Bear bombers, it's easy to forget how closely the RAF has watched our skies for decades.

A reminder is these rarely-seen images from the height of the Cold War, taken by specialist Air Ministry photographers and showing bombers, defensive missiles and the strangely beautiful forms they strike in our skies.

The full-colour photographs were painstakingly collated from the Imperial War Museum archives by aviation historian Ian Proctor, who wanted to document a time when the world hung on the brink of nuclear war.

Ever-ready: These full-colour photographs collated by historian Ian Proctor show the activities of the RAF at the height of the Cold War - when the threat from Russia was ever-present. Pictured, two Lightning F3s in flight over St Andrews in 1964

Attentive: Three men receive instructions from a master signaller after arriving at the Officer Cadet Training Unit at RAF Feltwell in 1964

History: A navigator-plotter is seen through the window of Victor B1 XH928 bomber of 10 Squadron at RAF Cottesmore in June 1959 (left), while guided missile fitters check the launcher of a Bloodhound Mark 1 of 62 (SAM) Squadron at RAF Woolfox Lodge in July 1961 (right)

Poised: The traffic control tower at RAF Lyneham on 26 June 1962. As most readers can probably tell, the image is staged for the cameras

The 160 photographs revealed publicly for the first time in his book, The Royal Air Force in the Cold War, 1950-1970, are part of a collection of 10,000 colour photographs taken by a small number of government photographers. 

Mr Proctor has shared the images to show the threat of Russian incursion is nothing new.

David Cameron said Moscow appeared to be trying to make 'some sort of a point' which should not be dignified with  a large-scale response after two long-range Tu-95s, known as Bears, had to be accompanied off the coast of Cornwall yesterday. 

'I think what this episode demonstrates is that we do have the fast jets, the pilots, the systems in place to protect the United Kingdom,' he said.  

Mr Proctor said: 'For the past 65 years, the RAF has maintained aircraft on a heightened alert state 24/7, 365 days a year, ready to intercept any unidentified military or civilian aircraft around the UK.

'Though there are now certainly fewer frontline squadrons and aircraft, experience gained during the Cold War along with increasingly advanced aircraft, mean the RAF's current air defences are as capable of responding to a potential threat as they had been in the 1950s and 1960s.

Formation: Javelins of 46 Squadron lined up neatly on the hard surface of RAF Odiham in July 1956. 'Even at the height of the Cold War, the armed forces were not immune to cuts,' Mr Proctor said. 'A number of defence reviews were undertaken during the period'

'Though the Cold War is over, the RAF still maintains QRA at two air stations. QRA (North) is held at RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, while QRA (South) is undertaken at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire.'

Mr Proctor said although some might fear cuts are hitting Britain's capability to respond to threats, cuts have always been a reality for peacetime armed forces.

'Even at the height of the Cold War, the armed forces were not immune to cuts,' he said. 'A number of defence reviews were undertaken during the period, each ultimately reducing the number of operational aircraft or front-line squadrons, as priorities changed or technology advanced.

'In 1956 Fighter Command had no more than 600 aircraft within 35 squadrons each with 18 operational aircraft.

By 1962, this had reduced to 150 aircraft in 11 squadrons. Today there are approximately 100 Typhoons in the air defence role, within five front line squadrons and one reserve, each operating an estimated 12 aircraft.'

Russian sorties towards the UK have been a reality ever since Churchill announced an Iron Curtain had descended over Europe.

Ian said: 'For the past few years, QRA aircraft have been scrambled on just over one day a month on average. Of these approximately only a third are in response to Russian military aircraft.

'As far as I am aware there has been no significant increase in the number of these flight over the years following the end of the Cold War.

'For Soviet aircraft to fly within British airspace during the Cold War, would have been a dangerous and provocative act, risking a response which could trigger a nuclear war. Instead they were usually flown on a course close to but outside British airspace.'

'Sorties undertaken by the TU-95 Bears along with those of the TU-16 Badgers and M-4 Bison, which together made up the Soviet Union's Cold War Strategic Bomber and Reconnaissance Force, had a number of purposes.

'Some flights were for reconnaissance, to take high and medium altitude photographs of British ports, bases, cities and coastline.

'However, the majority of flights then, as they are now, were to both test RAF air defences and train their own crews.

'By flying these sorties, irregularly and with different numbers of aircraft the Soviet Union could monitor RAF's capability to respond, the number of interceptors launched, when and where from.

'Essentially it was intelligence gathering rather than an aggressive act. Quite often the pilots of the aircraft would wave or communicate with each other during these intercepts, often to the chagrin of KGB officers on board the Soviet aircraft.

'Though publicly available information is limited, it would be naïve to believe that RAF operations did not include similar intelligence gathering flights by its bomber force.

'Certainly until the introduction of the American U2 in the early 1960s, much of NATO's reconnaissance of the Soviet Union was undertaken by RAF Canberra PR.7 aircraft.

'Similarly, modified bombers from the iconic V Force were flown to collect air samples from around the Soviet Union in order to monitor and analyse any nuclear tests undertaken.'

The collection of pictures can be seen in an online archive and at the Imperial War Museum.

The historian added: 'They record the aircraft daily activities of the men and women of the RAF during that dynamic period.

'A small number were used by the Air Ministry and RAF in recruitment brochures, and contemporary periodicals and newspaper supplements, but largely these are unknown and have never been seen before.

'Together the photographs portray the air force as it adapted to the combined threats of the Cold War and the frequent defence cuts of the 1950s and 1960s.

'As recruitment aids, they encouraged boys to become aircrew or skilled RAF tradesmen, both of which had seen a decline during the late 1950s.

'As a public relations tool, they promoted to the public and politicians the similarities between the RAF's vital Cold War role in defending Britain and its successes of the Second World War, then still in strong popular memory.'

Mr Proctor said many of the images are still being investigated to understand their subject and context.

More than 1,000 can be seen on IWM's online collection search database and more are released all the time. 

Figures from the MOD show the number of QRA launches in response to Russian aircraft so far have not been higher this year than previous years.

However, there have been reports that Nato has been busier in its response over the Baltic and Scandinavian regions escorting Russian aircraft.
