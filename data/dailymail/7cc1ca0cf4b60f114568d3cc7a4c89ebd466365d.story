A young Indian mother has died and her baby daughter suffered extensive burns after her husband and father-in-law set them on fire as they slept.

Pravartika Gupta, 25, and 13-month-old Idika were attacked at their home in Delhi's Sarojini Nagar neighbourhood in a dispute over a dowry payment.

Mrs Gupta died in the city's Safdarjung hospital on Sunday morning, eight days after the attack which left her daughter with 55 per cent burns.

The technology graduate managed to make a statement to a magistrate shortly before she succumbed to her injuries.

She said they were asleep in bed on October 6,when a fire broke out in front of their bedroom door and nobody came to help.

Both her husband Ashutosh Gupta and father-in-law Ram Mohan Gupta are now on the run after police announced they would be charged with murder, attempted murder and making illegal dowry demands.

Her father-in-law suffered minor burns in the blaze, but discharged himself from hospital before police could arrest him.

Mrs Gupta's father Kshamveer, a doctor, told detectives that her in-laws were were torturing her both mentally and physically over a dowry demand of £11,700.

In India, female children are often regarded as a burden because tradition requires large dowry fees to be paid to the other family when they are married.

The country has among the highest female infant mortality rates in the world.

The ratio in the 2011 census was 914 girls for every 1,000 boys, in comparison to 950 girls for every 1,000 boys worldwide.

Female infanticide has been widespread in India for generations.

In 1870, the British colonial government passed a law to ban it, but with little effect.

Girls must be married off. And to achieve that a daughter's parents usually have to pay the groom's family a dowry of cash and gifts - often a massive burden on the parents' savings and income.

Boys are also likely to provide more of an income than girls. Dowries were outlawed in 1961, but the practice is still common and the law all-but ignored.

The arrival of ultrasound technology in the 1980s, which made it possible to determine the sex of a foetus, made sex selection much easier.

Doctors were banned from revealing the sex of a foetus in 1994, but only one doctor has ever been prosecuted for doing so.

A senior police officer told 
HindustanTimes.com: 'Her father alleged that the accused family members 
had demanded £11,700 as dowry from him. The harassment continued even as
he paid £7,050 in cash to Pravartika's in-laws.

'We have arrested the victim's mother-in-law, but her husband and father-in-law are still at large.'Mrs Gupta's uncles have claimed that her husband was also angry with her because he had wanted their first child to be a boy.

One uncle, Rajesh Gupta, told the Daily Telegraph that Pravartika had wed Ashutosh Gupta two years ago after both families agreed a dowry payment. This was to include a £15,000 payment and Honda City car to the groom's parents.

But he claimed they then demanded a new apartment, despite her parents having spent £15,000 on the wedding and handed over £11,700 in cash.

Rajesh Gupta said: 'They said they had given a flat to their daughter's in-laws in dowry and we should do the same. They are economically well-off, but greedy.

'We bought gold and clothes for them on the baby's first birthday but they were not satisfied. A flat would cost between £35,000 and £117,000.

'They said you are not as good as we are. You must be proud to be our relatives and you must pay.'

He added: 'Why did he do this? He had everything - a beautiful wife, a beautiful girl, a prosperous house. What was in his mind we don't understand.'
