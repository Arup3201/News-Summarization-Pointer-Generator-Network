The mother of a four-year-old girl who was found unconscious and turning blue after wandering away from home at 3am has told police she had left the house to joyride and smoke marijuana.

Rebecca Reyes, 23, has been arrested after her daughter was found cowering by a neighbor's door in New London, Connecticut on Friday morning and rushed to hospital with hypothermia.

She called 911 at 3.38am to report that the girl was missing, and said she had woke up and found her daughter's bed empty.

When police asked Reyes if she had left the house at any point, she then said she had quickly left her three children, aged five, four and two, to go to the store, and returned to find the girl gone.

Arrested: Rebecca Reyes, 23, was arrested after her daughter wandered away from their home on Friday morning while Reyes went to smoke marijuana and go joyriding with a friend, police have said

But when pressed, she admitted she had left around 2am to go joyriding and smoking with a friend, before returning at 3am, NBC Connecticut reported.

Responding officers also reported that the home was covered with dirty laundry  mixed with toys and food. They also said they smelled marijuana and rotting garbage, NBC reported.

The children were sleeping on mattresses on the floor with no sheets or blankets, police said.

Police said Reyes was unemotional and did not inquire how her daughter was when the girl was eventually found after two and a half hours.

'Detectives said they're really wasn't a lot of remorse of her at that point. She had other things going on her agenda than taking care of her children at the time,' Peter Reichard, the New London Police acting police chief, told Fox CT.

'No remorse': Police said Reyes, pictured in court on Friday, did not ask how her four-year-old daughter was when she was found blue and unconscious after being outside for more than two hours

'What parent in their right mind goes out at 2:00 a.m. leaves their three infants behind to score drugs?' 

The New London Police and Fire Departments, police from Waterford, and Connecticut State Police searched for the girl.

She was discovered between a storm door and a door of a nearby apartment for warmth. She was wearing only a t-shirt, jeans and boots, police said.

She was turning blue and unconscious, and her temperature had dropped to 90 degrees as outdoor temperatures plunged to just three degrees (-16C).

Her fingers were red and swollen and she had 'frost nips' on her arms, back and legs, police said.

The girl, who was taken to hospital for treatment, later told police officers she had woken and looked for her mother but could not find her.

The child, who is now out of the hospital, and her two siblings are now being cared for by their mother's father. The girl's own father is in prison, WTNH reported.

Last year, she wrote on her Facebook page beneath an image of her children: 'Everything i do is for them. Im not living for likes,for people to like who i am,i dnt care what people think abt me, all im living for since the birth of my first,is my children. Point blank. Im just being Mommy to them.' 

Reyes has been charged with three counts risk of injury to a minor, first-degree reckless endangerment and false statement.

She appeared in court on Friday and will remain in jail on $250,000 bond. She is due back in court on March 13.
