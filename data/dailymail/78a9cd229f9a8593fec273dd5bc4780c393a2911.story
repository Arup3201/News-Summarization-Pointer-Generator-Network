At least 40 people have been killed in a suicide bomb attack in the capital of Yemen. 

The blast struck as hundreds of people were arriving in Tahrir Square, in Sanaa, for a rally organised by the Shia rebel group, the Houthis. 

The attack comes as the country slides into chaos, triggered by the rebels' takeover of the capital last month.

The bombing in Sanaa appeared to have been timed to cause a significant loss of life and was the deadliest in the capital since May 2012.

The blast struck as hundreds of people from the Houthis rebel group gathered in the capital to protest against the government's nomination for prime minister, despite his earlier resignation

The Houthis took control of the capital on September 21 and it has been agreed that a new administration include the rebel group - they protested against the prime minister put forward to lead the new government

The Houthis - Members of rebel group, also known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), who adhere to a branch of Shia Islam known as Zaidism. They demand more political inclusion. Their strongholds include Saada, al-Jawf and the Jeraf district inside Sanaa.

Al-Islah (Reform) - Sunni Islamist party that draws support and membership from heavily armed Sunni tribesmen, and is instrumental in rallying support behind the army and the government. Present in almost all of Yemen. The Houthis have identified the party as its arch-enemy.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - A merger of the Yemeni and Saudi branches of al-Qaeda. Seized large areas of territory in the south and the southeast after the uprising in 2011. Launched many attacks on armed forces and central authority establishments. Its power bases are Shabwah, Abyan and Hadramawt.

The Southern Separatist Movement - Umbrella group that wants the south to break away from the north and reinstate the former Socialist state that existed until 1990. Led by Ali al-Beidh.

The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), adhere to a branch of Shia Islam known as Zaidism. 

Since the group seized control of Sanaa on September 21, efforts have been made to set up a new Yemeni government, which includes the Houthis. 

Once the new administration is nominated, the Houthis are meant to withdraw their forces from the capital and allow the police and army to resume their duties.

However, the Houthis yesterday rejected President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's nomination of Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak for the post of prime minister.

The move had been announced on Tuesday after the president met the US ambassador to Yemen. 

Rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said  his group did not agree with the nomination and warned against 'blatant foreign interference'. 

Despite bin Mubarak resigning after only 33 hours in office, a demonstration in the capital was staged any way.

The group gathered in Sanaa and chanted against the government and corruption.

No group has said it was behind the bombings, but both bear similarities to previous attacks by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has vowed to fight the Houthis in defence of Sunnis.

On Wednesday, officials accused the jihadist group of responsibility for simultaneous attacks on security and government offices in the southern town of Bayda that left at least nine people dead.

A policeman who had been guarding a bank near Tahrir Square said he saw a man wearing an explosive belt approach a Houthi checkpoint.

'He then exploded amidst the [Houthi] security and ordinary people nearby,' he told the Reuters news agency.

A photographer working for AFP described seeing the bodies of four children amid the carnage. Medics said dozens of people were also wounded by the blast.

Although no group has said it is behind the attack, it bears similarities to previous attacks by terrorist group al-Qaeda, which has vowed to fight the Houthis in defence of Sunnis

Later, a suicide bomb attack on an army checkpoint in the eastern province of Hadramawt left 20 soldiers dead.

In the Hadramawt attack, a tank and two army vehicles were destroyed when a suicide bomber blew up his explosives-filled car at a checkpoint outside the city of Mukalla.

Western and Gulf Arab countries are worried that instability in Yemen could strengthen al Qaeda and have supported a U.N.-backed political transition since 2012. 

The modern Republic of Yemen was created in 1990 when traditional North Yemen and Communist South Yemen merged after years of clashes. 

Since unification Yemen has been slowly modernising and opening up to the world, but still retains much of its tribal character.

A short civil war in 1994 ended in defeat for separatist southerners, but regional tensions re-emerged in the summer of 2009 when government troops and Houthi rebels clashed in the north, killing hundreds and displacing more than a quarter of a million people.

Yemen was hit by more serious political upheaval early in 2011 when protesters - inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt - rallied against the three-decades-old rule of President Saleh. He stepped down as part of a deal brokered by neighbouring countries at the end of the year, ushering in a transitional period of political reforms.

In the meantime, Yemen had become a major base for Islamic militants after the crackdown on al-Qaeda closed their training bases in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 

Since then government forces and al-Qaeda have battled for control of several towns in the south, while the US has used unmanned drones against the Islamists.

The precariousness of the government's hold was dramatically demonstrated in September 2014, when Houthi rebels swept into Sanaa and seized control of the capital.

Since the group seized control of Sanaa, efforts have been made to set up a new Yemeni government, which includes the Houthis.
