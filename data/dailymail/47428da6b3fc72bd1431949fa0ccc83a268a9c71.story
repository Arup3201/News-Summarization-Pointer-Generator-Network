Gus Poyet is running out of answers to reverse the form of sorry Sunderland after individual errors again proved costly.

The Black Cats boss pleaded for more time to stamp his identity on the team in the wake of their 8-0 humiliation at Southampton last weekend.

But Poyet says his attempt at progress is being undermined by the mistakes of his players, Wes Brown and goalkeeper Vito Mannone the pair guilty of gifting Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez a match-winning double on Saturday.

‘We cannot make any more - no more mistakes,’ he blasted. ‘Individual ones like that, no more, otherwise it is impossible to win games.

‘One was bad enough, but to have two mistakes, two goals conceded like that after last weekend, is tough. It’s not something you expect or you can train (to prevent).’

Poyet, who has been in the job for one year now, continues to talk in riddles when asked whether or not he is happy with the strength and depth of his playing personnel.

The subtext of his coded comments is that he is not responsible for the club’s transfer strategy and there is thought to be tension between himself and sporting director Lee Congerton.

Poyet, it seems, is now unhappy with the mass turnover during the summer.

‘From last year, the team that started against Arsenal here, seven players (it is six plus one substitute) from the Sunderland line up are not at the club anymore,’ he said.

‘Eight of the starting 11 of Arsenal are in their squad. We start all the way from zero, so how can you have a consistency of understanding the game and a mentality if you are starting afresh every year? You are always catching up. You need your team to get momentum.’

Poyet’s Sunderland certainly have momentum right now, only their trajectory is very much downwards.
