The family of Reddit founder Aaron Swartz who committed suicide on Friday have blamed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and federal prosecutors for his death.

Swartz was facing criminal hacking charges, which carried a potential sentence of more than 30 years when he hanged himself at his New York City apartment.

In a statement, his loved ones claimed the attorney's office pursed an 'exceptionally harsh array of charges' for a supposed crime that had no victims, and MIT refused to stand up for Swartz or it's own 'cherished principles'.

'Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy,' the family, and the 26-year-old's partner Taren Stinebricker-Kaufmann, wrote.

'It is the product of a criminal 
justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. 
Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney’s office 
and at MIT contributed to his death.'

Swartz's friend Larry Lessig, a 
Harvard University professor and internet law expert, similarly blamed 
the federal prosecutor, who he called a 
'bully,' on his blog and said that Swartz had been 'driven to the edge' by the 
government's aggressive and disproportionate handling of the case.

'Our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed,' Lessig wrote.

In the statement, Swartz' loved ones described him as 'extraordinary and irreplaceable.'

They said his 'insatiable curiosity, 
creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for 
selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable'
made the world and their lives 'far brighter.'

The online activist and co-founder of
the popular social media site Reddit took is life just weeks before 
going on trial for the federal hacking charges.

Tragic end: Aaron Swartz, a programmer and Internet activist who co-founded a company that would eventually grow into Reddit, committed suicide Friday in New York City

Troubled soul: Swartz had been vocal about his years-long struggle with depression, extensively writing about it and discussing it in public forums 

The news of Swartz's untimely death was confirmed to MIT's The Tech by both his uncle and his lawyer on Saturday morning. 

Swartz's uncle, Michael Wolf, told the New York Times
that the programmer's body was discovered by his girlfriend inside his 
home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn at around 9.30am.

Police told the New York Daily News that
the 26-year-old ended his life by hanging himself from a belt in his 
seventh-floor unit on Sullivan Place. He left no suicide note.

Swartz was a gifted programmer who 
helped develop the RSS at age 14. He then went on to start a company that would eventually merge with Reddit, as well as 
Demand Progress, a political action group that campaigns against internet censorship.

He was arrested 
in 2011 for allegedly downloading more than four million academic journals 
with intent to distribute them free of charge through file-sharing 
sites. He faced up to 35 years in prison if convicted.

In the past, Swartz hinted at a battle with depression, according to Gawker.

In a 2007 speech, the internet advocate described himself as being 'miserable' after moving to San Francisco when his company was purchased by the publishing giant Conde Nast. 

'I couldn't stand San Francisco. I couldn't stand office life,' he said at the time. 'I took a long Christmas vacation. I got sick. I thought of suicide. I ran from the police. And when I got back on Monday morning, I was asked to resign.'

In a blog post from later that year, Swartz went into further detail regarding his bout with depression.

'Your
face falls. Perhaps you cry. You feel worthless. You wonder whether 
it's worth going on,' he wrote. 'Everything you think about seems bleak - the things
you've done, the things you hope to do, the people around you.

'You
want to lie in bed and keep the lights off. Depressed mood is like 
that, only it doesn't come for any reason and it doesn't go for any 
either. Go outside and get some fresh air or cuddle with a loved one and
you don't feel any better, only more upset at being unable to feel the 
joy that everyone else seems to feel. Everything gets colored by the 
sadness.'

Big business: Reddit was later sold to the publishing giant Conde Nast, but in 2011 it became operationally independent again

In September 
2012, Swartz was charged with 13 counts of felony hacking stemming from 
his July 2011 arrest and subsequent indictment by the Department of 
Justice for allegedly swiping MIT papers from the JSTOR online journal 
archive.

Two years earlier, Swartz allegedly connected a laptop to MIT's systems through a basement network wiring cupboard.

He
registered as a guest under the fictitious name, Gary Host - a hacking 
in-joke in which the first initial and last name spell 'ghost.'

He
then used a software program to 'rapidly download an extraordinary 
volume of articles from JSTOR,' according to the indictment.

In
the following months, MIT and JSTOR tried to block the recurring and 
massive downloads, on occasion denying all MIT users access to JSTOR.

But Swartz allegedly got around it, in part, by disguising the computer source of the demands for data.

In
November and December, Swartz is said to have made 2 million downloads 
from JSTOR, 100 times the number made during the same period by all 
legitimate JSTOR users at MIT.

It
is alleged that on Jan. 6, Swartz went to the wiring closet to remove 
the laptop, attempting to shield his identity by holding a bike helmet 
in front of his face and seeing his way through its ventilation holes.

He fled when MIT police tried to question him that day, it is claimed.

The 26-year-old Internet wunderkind pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, but spent the next several months struggling to come up with the money to cover legal fees and continue his fight against the Justice Department, the site ZDnet reported.

Ironically, Swartz's suicide came just two days after JSTOR announced that ii will be releasing more than 4.5 million articles to the public.

'Our goal is for everyone around the world to be able to use the content we have put online and are preserving,' JSTOR Managing Director Laura Brown said in a statement.

On Saturday, Swartz's mother has posted a statement on the site YCombinator:

'Thank you all for your kind words and thoughts. Aaron has been depressed about his case/upcoming trial, but we had no idea what he was going through was this painful.

Legal troubles: In 2011, the Reddit co-founder was arrested and charged with hacking into MIT's JSTOR online journal archive and stealing more than four million academic papers

'Aaron was a terrific young man. He 
contributed a lot to the world in his short life and I regret the loss 
of all the things he had yet to accomplish. As you can imagine, we all 
miss him dearly. The grief is unfathomable.

Swartz's
friend Cory Doctorow, of Boing Boing, published a touching tribute in 
his honor early  a tribute early Saturday morning after learning of his 
death.

'I'm so sorry for Aaron, and sorry about Aaron. My sincere condolences to his parents, whom I never met, but who loved their brilliant, magnificently weird son and made sure he always had chaperonage when he went abroad on his adventures,' he wrote in part.

'We have all lost someone today who had more work to do, and who made the world a better place when he did it.'

In his piece, Doctorow speculated that it is possible that what drove his friend to suicide is the prospect of incarceration, and all that comes with it.

'Imprisonment is one of my most visceral terrors, and it's at least credible that fear of losing his liberty, of being subjected to violence (and perhaps sexual violence) in prison, was what drove Aaron to take this step,' he wrote. 

Our beloved brother, son, friend, and partner Aaron Swartz hanged himself on Friday in his Brooklyn apartment. We are in shock, and have not yet come to terms with his passing.

Aaron's insatiable curiosity, creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable - these gifts made the world, and our lives, far brighter. We're grateful for our time with him, to those who loved him and stood with him, and to all of those who continue his work for a better world.

Aaron's commitment to social justice was profound, and defined his life. He was instrumental to the defeat of an Internet censorship bill; he fought for a more democratic, open, and accountable political system; and he helped to create, build, and preserve a dizzying range of scholarly projects that extended the scope and accessibility of human knowledge. He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place. His deeply humane writing touched minds and hearts across generations and continents. He earned the friendship of thousands and the respect and support of millions more.

Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death. The US Attorney's office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims. Meanwhile, unlike JSTOR, MIT refused to stand up for Aaron and its own community's most cherished principles.

Today, we grieve for the extraordinary and irreplaceable man that we have lost.
