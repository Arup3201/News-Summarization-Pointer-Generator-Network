This is the dramatic moment a young boy was caught by skiers and snowboarders as he plunged from a broken ski lift.

The incident at Mount Rose ski resort, near Reno, Nevada, was recorded by a camera attached to the helmet of one of the rescuers.

People rushed to the boy's aid as he struggled to hold onto the ski lift and was in danger of falling and seriously injuring himself.

The video, which has nearly 100,000 views on YouTube, shows the youngster's struggle on the ski lift as onlookers immediately begin formulating a plan to ensure the boy is in safe hands when he falls.

Initially, about 15 men link arms and form a chain under the stricken child while encouraging him to 'hold on'.

They soon find a rubber mat, which they roll out and use as a makeshift platform for the boy to land on to soften his fall.  

Moments later there is a loud thud as the boy loses his grip, falls and lands on the rubber mat. 

One of the men reaches out to the boy and comforts him, saying: 'It's alright man.'
