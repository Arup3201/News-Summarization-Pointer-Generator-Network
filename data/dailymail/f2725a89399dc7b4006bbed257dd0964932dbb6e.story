An Irishman is in a critical condition after he was allegedly the victim of a one-punch attack from his brother on a Sydney street.

His 33-year-old brother has been charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm.

He was refused bail and will appear in Parramatta Bail Court later today.

It's alleged that a 33-year-old man punched his 32-year-old brother in the head at around 3am on Saturday morning, causing him to fall onto the footpath outside a Kings Cross nightclub in Sydney's inner city.

Emergency services found him in a pool of blood and vomit on Bayswater Road outside Hugos Lounge, according to News Corp.

Two Irish brothers were involved in a confrontation outside a nightclub in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner city which has left the younger brother fighting for his life

Emergency services found a man in a pool of his own blood in Kings Cross after he was punched in the head, allegedly by his own brother

The victim underwent surgery at St Vincent's Hospital, also in Sydney's inner city, with serious brain injuries.  

He is in a critical but stable condition. Police said that it will be another 24 to 48 hours before doctors can determine the extent of the injuries, after the swelling on the brain goes down.

Police are expecting to charge the 33-year-old man and he will appear at Parramatta Local Court this afternoon. 

The man who has been charged and his father arrived in Australia with their father three days ago for a holiday, according to NSW Police. 

The victim has been travelling around Australia since June. 

'This is a family tragedy that has happened on our streets,' Kings Cross detective superintendent Michael Fitzgerald.

He confirmed that alcohol was not a factor in the fight.

Supt. Fitzgerald said that the 'pain in the Father's eyes' as indescribable, all due to 'one punch from one brother to another'. 

'To have one son facing serious criminal charges and another son fighting for his life.' 

The fight occurred after a 'minor' argument and the alleged culprit only gave a low range blood alcohol reading. 

The brothers had been at dinner with their father earlier in the evening before the father left and the two young men continued on to a bar for a drink, according to Police. 

It's claimed that the young man was in cardiac arrest when the ambulance was first called, according to news.com.au. 

A bouncer says the older brother was distraught and shocked when he realised what had happened, according to Nine News.

'He screamed when he realised how bad it was,' a bouncer told news.com.au.

Police say CCTV footage showed the brothers having an argument before the 32-year-old victim pushed his older brother and a punch was then thrown.

'I was trying to calm him down, the whole situation was pretty full on,' said security guard Dion Miller, who administered First Aid to the victim as soon as he saw the incident, according to ABC News.

The 33-year-old man is in police custody and helping police with their investigation.

He did not sustain any injuries.  

A crime scene has been established and is being examined by detectives and specialist forensic officers.

Police are urging any witnesses to inform Crime stoppers of anything they know about the incident to assist investigations.

The younger brother is undergoing emergency surgery at St Vincent's Hospital whilst his brother assists police with their investigations. He did not sustain any injuries
