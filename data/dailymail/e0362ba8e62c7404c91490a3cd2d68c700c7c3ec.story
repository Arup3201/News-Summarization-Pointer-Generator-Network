Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal and reserve goalkeeper Victor Valdes were caught up in a moment of drama before Friday's FA Cup tie at Cambridge United.

The pair were visibly concerned as a bloodied fan received medical attention in the visitors' dugout at the Abbey Stadium.

The injured supporter appeared to have suffered a facial injury and it looked like he was receiving treatment from members of the vistors' backroom team.

As the match kicked off it was not known what happened to the man but it was suggested he had fallen near the dugout.

In an unrelated incident later, a man, believed to be a Manchester United fan, was ejected from a section of the stadium reserved for home supporters.

Police and stewards escorted the man around the edge of the pitch.

Van Gaal and his staff then endured a torrid 90 minutes as they were held to a goalless by the League Two side.

The two sides will replay at Old Trafford for a place in the fifth round.
