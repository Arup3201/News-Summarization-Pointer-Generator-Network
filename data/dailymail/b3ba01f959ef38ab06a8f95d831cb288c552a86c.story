As the daughter of a multi-millionaire rock star, she grew up in luxury properties in some of the world’s most desirable locations.

But as a newlywed, Jade Jagger, daughter of Rolling Stone Mick, has named a housing association flat that would normally be occupied by a tenant from a council waiting list as her home.

Priority for such properties is also more likely to be given to the homeless, disabled and those in  low-paid jobs.

However for Sir Mick’s second daughter it has become her new home after tying the knot with DJ Adrian Fillary last year.

Jewellery designer Miss Jagger, 41, has listed the one-bedroom central London apartment, which is rented by her husband for just £120 a week, as her place of residence on documents filed with Companies House.

The newlyweds registered the address when they set up their firm 71Ltd in October last year.

The property, underneath the Oxo Tower restaurant on the south bank of the Thames, is one of 78 flats leased by Redwood Housing to struggling residents who are deemed to be ‘in housing need’.

Half the tenants come from council waiting lists.

By contrast, Sir Mick, who is reported to be worth £200million, owns a string of exclusive properties around the world, including a 17th century mansion in Chelsea bought for £10million in 2006, a Georgian mansion on Richmond Hill, South West London, bought for £2.5million in 1993, a 16th century chateau in the Loire valley, a £1.5million Paris apartment, and a villa on the private Caribbean island of Mustique bought for £2million in 2006.

While Miss Jagger would not be eligible for a housing association property, it is understood that her husband satisfied Redwood’s strict criteria when he moved in 13 years ago.

Despite his marriage to Miss Jagger, he has continued to rent the property.

Miss Jagger has two daughters, Assisi, 20, and Amba, 17, from her relationship with artist Piers Jackson.

She married Fillary, 41, who began working as a DJ in the early Nineties before going on to work as a nightclub promoter, in a lavish wedding in June last year.

Miss Jagger has insisted in the past that she has never wanted to live off her father’s money, saying:

‘I’m not a trust-fund child. I think my father’s got a healthy work ethic and, therefore, I think it just came with the part. You’ve got to look after yourself.

‘It probably came more so from having kids and wanting to support them and look after them and give them the best I could.’

A spokesman for the Coin Street Housing Co-operative, which owns the flats, said marrying a wealthy partner would not affect a tenant’s eligibility to continue renting the property if it remained their main residence.

Accounts at Companies House show the designer’s jewellery business made £133,924 last year. In February 2010, she sold her North London townhouse for £1.36million.

She still owns a £3million farmhouse in Ibiza, where she is understood to spend most of her time, and a £300,000 beachfront home in Goa.

A spokesman for Miss Jagger said: ‘While Adrian had lived at the Oxo Tower as a single man for over ten years, now he is recently married, he is currently actively looking to buy a house in the area and move out.

‘Although he is not contravening any rules or regulations, he has informed both the Co-op’s independent managing agent and the Co-op’s own management committee of his intentions to move out in the near future, as a matter of courtesy and in the spirit of co-operative living.’

Miss Jagger is Sir Mick’s second daughter, from his marriage to model Bianca De Macias. He has six other children with three further women – 42-year-old Karis from his relationship with Marsha Hunt, Lizzie, 28, James, 27, Georgia May, 21 and Gabriel, 15, all from his marriage to model Jerry Hall, and a 13-year-old son, Lucas, with Brazilian model Luciana Morad.
