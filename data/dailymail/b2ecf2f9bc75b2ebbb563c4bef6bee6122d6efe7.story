Time-pressed parents on the school run who have dodged traffic wardens, puddles and the disparaging looks of other mums face a new obstacle at the schoolgate: rosette-wearing Labour candidates.

Ed Miliband’s party has urged wannabe MPs to target mothers outside schools in a bid to woo swing voters ahead of the general election.

Senior figures believe face-to-face chats whiling dropping off or picking up children are more effective than relying on more modern techniques like Facebook and Twitter.

Labour enjoyed a strong lead over the Tories among women for the early years of the coalition, but in recent months the gap has narrowed.

David Cameron’s so-called ‘women problem’ was exposed by a study last year which showed female voters had turned against the Tories for being out of touch and too posh.

The cash-strapped Labour party now admits it cannot compete with the multi-million spending of the Tory party, and instead will seek to focus on grassroots campaigning.

In particular, this will include sending candidates and activists to woo mothers outside schools.

Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow women’s minister, said the tactic could prove more effective than the rush to campaign online.

It comes as Labour's latest web attack ad on VAT rises backfired, because most food is excluded.

Shadow women's minister Yvette Cooper said most political parties are not good at using social media

Speaking at an event on women in politics, she said: ‘I think social media is really important, and political parties aren’t great at it and are learning.

‘It means not just Facebook, it’s also about standing at the schoolgate and talking to mums as well.

‘I just wouldn’t underestimate face-to-face contact. We are just trying to go and stand at the schoolgate and you see a lot of people going by, a lot of people in a hurry but there are also people who just want to talk about  something that they are worried about.

‘Politicians should always go to where people  are, rather than expecting people to come to where politics is.’

Labour's lead has been cut to just one point in the latest YouGov poll for The Sun, putting Mr Miliband's party on 35 per cent and the Tories on 34 per cent.

Among women, Labour is ahead on 37 per cent with the Tories on 33 per cent. But among men, the Tories are ahead on 35 per cent to 34 for Labour.

Miss Cooper was speaking at the launch of the latest Asda Mumdex survey of 11,000 mothers who shop at the supermarket.

It found just one in 10 mums think politicians have their best interests at heart.

But in boost for Mr Miliband, it showed 65 per cent of mums want action to impose limits on energy prices.

Labour's new attack on the Coalition accused Nick Clegg and David Cameron of acting together to hike the cost of the weekly shop. But most of a family's everyday food bill is VAT free

Labour has promised to freeze bills for two years if it wins the election in May 2015.

A Labour party spokesman said: ‘We do have a strong ground operation in each of our target seats. It is people out and about talking to the public, trying to explain face-to-face.

‘While the Conservatives might outspend us, we can out-campaign them. That level of door-to-door, street-to-street talking takes place day-in-day-out.

‘We will talk to mums and dads face-to-face wherever we find them, be it in the workplace, in shopping centres, be it at the schoolgate.’
