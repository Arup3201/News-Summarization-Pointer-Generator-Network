Suffolk Strangler Steve Wright has sparked anger by launching a third bid for freedom as his victims' families mark the anniversary of his twisted killing spree.

Wright, 54, murdered five prostitutes in the Ipswich area over five days in December 2006 and was jailed for life in 2008.

Brother David, 53, who regularly visits Wright in Long Larton prison, Worcestershire, has confirmed he is lining up a fresh attempt to overturn the conviction.

Appeal: David Wright, right, confirmed his killer brother Steve, left, is to launch a fresh bid for freedom

The case could cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds, with Wright being entitled to legal aid.

Brian Clennell, 63, whose 24-year-old daughter Paula was Wright's fifth victim, told The Sun: 'Are we never going to be allowed to grieve? This brings it all up again.

'The Government pleads poverty yet money can always be found if you are a criminal for appeals like this.'

But David said: 'Steve's innocent and I've got the evidence. He hasn't shown any regret because he hasn't done anything wrong.'

He also described his brother's luxury lifestyle behind bars, which includes daily gym visits and a television and PlayStation in his cell.

Forklift driver Wright picked up his victims - Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clenell, 24, and Annette Nicholls, 29 - while his girlfriend was working nightshifts.

He strangled or asphyxiated them when they were incapacitated with massive doses of heroin, and their bodies were stripped and dumped in remote countryside.

At his Ipswich Crown Court trial in 2008, Wright admitted having sex with four of the five victims but denied killing any them. He was told he would spend the rest of his life in jail.

The former QE2 steward dropped his first appeal in 2009 and later that year had his second bid thrown out by the courts.

During the six-week trial, forensic evidence revealed that Wright's DNA was on three of the murdered women and fibres linked him to all five victims.

There was also CCTV footage of him cruising the red-light district by car.

Wright told jurors he visited prostitutes after his sex life with partner Pamela Wright became 'almost non-existent'.
