 'I just thought they were a Halloween prank, and really didn't give it much thought after that.'

But on Tuesday morning they decided to investigate after people expressed concerns on social media.

'I admit it looked kind of creepy,' Sedinger said.

'You could see them from the road. We figured it was best to get them up.'
