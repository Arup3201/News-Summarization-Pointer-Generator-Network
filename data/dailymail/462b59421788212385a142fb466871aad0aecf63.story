A £2million country pile complete with extensive stables, scenic views over the south Cotswolds and a set of rather unlikely neighbours.

The luxury home next door to Prince Charles' Highgrove estate has gone on the market creating a storm of interest.

The properties share a boundary fence and just three fields separate the grounds of Ashworth House from its royal neighbours.

Described as 'a superb Cotswold stone property of generous proportions' Ashworth House has been 'sympathetically modernised' to blend rustic charm with comfort and convenience

Located in the rural village of Westonbirt near the historic market town of Tetbury in Gloucestershire, Ashworth House is approached by a beautiful sweeping driveway.

With four bedrooms and three bathrooms it is not the biggest of homes but the chance to stop in for a royal cup of tea next door more than makes up for it.

Described as 'a superb Cotswold stone property of generous proportions' estate agents Chesterton Humberts emphasise who Ashworth House 'has been sympathetically modernised in recent years to create a wonderful family home.'

The entrance hallway is 'spacious', the kitchen/breakfast room is 'magnificent' and the living space is topped off by a 'sunny orangery' leading to the gardens beyond.

Three more reception rooms look out over the stunning gardens and there is even a large utility room to leave your muddy coats and boots after a tromp around the 12 acre grounds.

Four reception rooms on the ground floor include a living room with beautiful fireplace and a sunny orangery

And all that is in addition to the chance of finding is Royal Highness peering over your garden fence. 

But bargain hunters should look away now as the 'spacious' home will offer little change from a cool £2million.

Upstairs there are four large bedrooms, with both the master and guest bedroom enjoying their own en-suites - occupants of the other two rooms must endure the hardship of sharing a 'family' bathroom between them.

And if that isn't enough Ashworth also has a 'delightful' two-bedroom cottage nestled in nearly 12 acres of grounds where guests can be generously accommodated without disturbing the main household.

Spacious: The open plan kitchen and breakfast room with large central island is described as 'magnificent' by agents

Relaxed: With four reception rooms and a separate guest cottage Ashworth house offers plenty of space to unwind and entertain

Modern and traditional: While the exterior of the home remains in-keeping with the typical stone architecture of the area, the interiors have been gently renovated to feel light and modern

Here visiting relatives or monarchs can enjoy the open plan kitchen and living area with a characteristic spiral staircase leading to the bedrooms above. 

Estate agent Nick Crowall described the opportunity the property offers to share a fence with the Prince of Wales.

He said: 'The property shares the boundary fence with Highgrove, it's a matter of three fields away.

'Although Ashworth is less than half a mile from the main house on the royal estate unfortunately you can only see the trees, it is as you would imagine exceptionally well protected.

Upstairs: Four large airy bedrooms are complete with period features and beautiful views over the grounds

Well equipped: Both the master bedroom and the guest bedroom have their own ensuite facilities while the other two bedrooms share a generously proportioned family bathroom

'It has been on the market for a couple of months now and has had quite a lot of interest, it has wonderful equestrian facilities and is right in the heart of the Beaufort Hunt.

'You're looking at the boundary with the royal residence, you could literally hop the fence and be there and of course there is the phenomenal pull of the Highrove shop as well.'

Ashworth also comes with top class riding facilities, including an American barn stable complex built by Monarch equestrian which can accommodate a dozen horses.

There is also a tack room, separate WC, wash box with rubberised floor, tack room and drying room and feed room.

In the heart of the hunt: With stunning views of rural Gloucestershire, the trees protecting the main home at Highgrove can also be seen across the fields

Cosy: Nestled into 12 acres of grounds the property also has a separate two bedroom cottage with spiral staricase

Outdoors there is also a 40m x 20m riding school next to the stable block and remaining land is divided into four post and rail fenced paddocks.

The 'well established gardens' which surround the house are laid out as lawns punctuates with with mature trees and shrub borders.

Highgrove, the country home of the Prince of Wales, was bought by the Duchy of Cornwall in 1980 as was used by the Prince Charles and Princess Diana as a weekend home from autumn of 1981.

The house was previously the home of 
Maurice Macmillan, Conservative MP for Farnham and son of the former 
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, for 14 years.

It has four reception rooms, nine main bedrooms, a nursery wing and staff quarters and at the time was also where the young Prince William and Harry's ponies were kept.

It was built 1796 to 1798 and is believed to have been designed by architect Anthony Keck.

The Highgrove estate consists of the woodland around the main house, a number of farm buildings and around 900 acres of farm land known as the Home Farm.

A keen gardener, the Prince of has devoted much time to planning and designing the gardens Highgrove.

Over the last 30 year he has created a wild garden, a formal garden and a walled kitchen garden and planted a large number of trees in the grounds.

The estate also backs onto the grounds of Westonbirt Arboretum.

The village of Westonbirt itself is a popular and sought after area in the south Cotswolds.

The American style barn can accommodate a dozen horses and also has a tack room, drying room, feed room and separate WC

State of the art: Ashworth boasts top class equestrian facilities including paddocks and purpose built riding school

The area is also superbly situated for those with sporting interests with polo at Beaufort Polo Club and Badminton and Gatcombe horse trials just a short distance away.

The property is conveniently located with acccess to the M4 at Junctions 17 and 18 providing easy access to London and the M5.

There are also regular train services to London Paddington from Kemble and Chippenham, both around 10 miles away.

The area is particularly well served by both state and independent schools for girls and boys including numerous local private schools such as Beaudesert Park, Westonbirt, Rosehill Westonbirt, St Mary’s Calne as well as the colleges in Cheltenham and Bath.
