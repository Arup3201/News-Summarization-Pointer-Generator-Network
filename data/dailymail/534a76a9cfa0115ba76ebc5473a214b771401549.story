An Australian couple were slapped with a speeding ticket while travelling to hospital for the birth of their first child.

Patrick and Mallory Stafford are pleading for leniency after they were fined $298 for driving 15km over the speed limit through the Melba tunnel in Victoria.

Mrs Stafford was rushed to Box Hill Hospital after her water broke at 5.30am on June 9 and she later gave birth to their son Jonah.

'It’s not as if I was going at an incredibly excessive speed,' Patrick Stafford told 9NEWS.

'You hear all these stories of people giving birth on side of road, I don’t want that to be me.'

Mrs Stafford said she wanted to be at the hospital for her first child’s birth as she 'didn’t know what to expect.'

The Boronia couple requested an internal review for their infringement notice, only to have their application rejected.

'There was no one on the road, I was clearly focused on the road, I’m a good driver, you know, I wasn’t putting anyone in danger,' Mr Stafford said.

9NEWS reports Victoria police receives more than 250,000 requests each year for an internal review and with each case judged on its own merits around 20 percent are downgraded to an official warning.

But with their rejection letter, the Staffords have no choice but to take it to court.

'It is very difficult to get off these cases. Unless the emergency was immediate and exceptional, then quite often they’ll have to pay the fine,' lawyer Michael Kuzilny said.

Despite the speeding fine, Mr Stafford said he has no regrets.

'I probably would speed again, because I didn't know what was happening and I would qualify it as an emergency,' he said.
