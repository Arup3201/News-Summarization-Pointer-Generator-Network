Belligerent North Korea was reported yesterday to have launched a refurbished Soviet-era submarine, capable of firing ballistic missiles that could easily reach its enemy neighbour, South Korea - and far beyond.

Military and government sources in Seoul were quoted by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency as saying that the development raises further concerns about the North’s evolving missile and nuclear threats.

The disturbing news comes as photos were released of unpredictable leader Kim Jong-un visiting a North Korean air force base where, the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported, he checked out equipment on a fighter jet and ‘gave instructions’ to pilots.

Despite walking with a stick, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un managed to climb into the cockpit of a plane

He climbed into the cockpit of one of the pursuit aircraft and congratulated the pilots for their skills. He even promoted four squadron leaders on the spot.

News of Kim’s visit prompted a South Korean source to remark that the North’s pilots have little experience in air battles and are ‘seized with fear’ at the thought of taking on Seoul’s airmen who have access to far superior technology.

Whether Kim’s visit - his ninth to air force units this year - and the launching of the nuclear-capable submarine was just ‘sabre-rattling’ or a severe warning of troubles ahead was not immediate apparent.

The ‘new’ submarine, which was decommissioned by the former Soviet Union in 1990, is said to be 67 meters long with a beam of 6.6 meters.

The 3,500-ton Golf II class submarine carries the R-21 liquid-propellant missile with a 1,180 kilogram warhead and a maximum range of 1,420 kilometres.

News of the North’s submarine first emerged last month in a report by the US Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in the US.

Another source was quoted by the Yonhap news agency today as saying that in a move to mount a missile tube on the refurbished submarine, North Korea has carried out dozens of tests on the ground and at sea.

‘According to the analysis of satellite imagery…a ground test facility for the SLBM (submarine-launched ballistic missile) launch has been up and running at the Sinpo shipyard,’ said the source.

The source added that a dozen more tests would be required to perfect the technology.

The source’s comments are said to be in line with what arms expert Joseph S.Bermudez Jr. said in a recent report that North Korea had built a ‘new test stand’ at its secret Sinpo shipyard to research and develop SLBMs.

That test stand has a 35-by-30 meter concrete pad and stands about 12 meters high.

‘It would take one or two years before the North completes the test for the vertical launch of missiles from the sea,’ a military source in Seoul said today.

The communist regime has more submarines than South Korea, but they are equipped with outdated weapons.
