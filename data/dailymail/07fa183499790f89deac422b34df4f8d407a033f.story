Three caesarean sections had taken their toll on the body of Suzie Adams, 39, leaving her overweight and self-conscious about her sagging stomach.

But when the Somerset mother flew to the Czech Republic for a cut-price tummy tuck, the consequences were worse than she could ever have imagined.

Far from getting the flat tummy she had always longed for, Ms Adams was subjected to a botch job that left her badly scarred and attached to a shunt for six months.

Botched: Suzie Adams, 39, from Somerset, was left in agony following a badly bungled tummy tuck

Unhappy: Suzie had been embarrassed about her flabby tummy - the result of three pregnancies

Now Ms Adams, who has since had much of the damage repaired in the UK, has warned of the dangers of travelling abroad for surgery and says she was left feeing like a 'walking, living freak'.

'I've got three children, I had three caesarean sections with them and I had this roll of fat that I didn't like - like an apron of skin,' she explains.

'I looked around the UK and there was nothing I could afford. They were asking from £8,000 upwards really.'

Desperate to get rid of the flabby tummy that was making her self-conscious, she decided to look abroad. 

'I found this company in Prague and they were a lot cheaper,' she explains. 'Prices were anything from £1,500 to £3,000 really.'

Beguiled by the prospect of a cheap tummy tuck, Ms Adams packed her bags and flew to the Czech capital.

But soon, she realised things weren't quite as they seemed. 'The accommodation I was supposed to have gone into wasn't ready so they dumped me in a hotel,' she remembers.

'It was at that point I realised it was going to go wrong.'

Despite her qualms, she decided to go ahead with the surgery. 'They took me into see the surgeon,' she says.

'Communication between us was difficult but the agreement was, he was going to cut me from right to left, one scarring, tighten up the stomach muscles, end of story.'

But when she woke up, she was appalled by the results. Not only had the surgeon cut right to left, he had also cut top to bottom from her belly button down.

'I was horrified because it was not what we agreed,' she reveals. 'They didn't explain why. They just said they had to.'

After 10 days recuperating in Prague, Ms Adams flew home. But things were about to get even worse.

Already suffering from excruciating stomach pain, she had to be rushed to hospital after her scar burst open and a mysterious, painful lump appeared on her side.

Doctors said her skin was no longer attached to her stomach muscles and discovered that the wound had become badly infected. 

Roll: Ms Adams hated the roll of fat left around her middle following three pregnancies

Damage: She had to be rushed to hospital after her scar burst open and became badly infected

Scarred: The scars left by the infection and the botched surgery left her feeling like 'a walking, talking freak'

'They said they had never seen anything like this before,' recounts a horrified Ms Adams. 'Injuries like this normally come through gunshot wounds - not surgery.

'They then turned round and told me I'd have to have a vacuum pump so they could heal me from the inside out.'

She was attached to the pump for 24 hours a day for the next six months. When it was finally removed, her scars were worse than ever and the lump hadn't gone away. 

'I hated looking in the mirror,' she admits. 'I didn't even like my partner seeing it. But I forced myself to look in the mirror to remind me of the stupid mistake I made by going over there. 'I was a walking, living freak.'

Eventually, two years after the bungled operation that almost destroyed her life, Ms Adams decided to take action and travelled to Norwich to see surgeon Elaine Sassoon.

Big improvement: Ms Adams has now had a second operation to fix the damage and restore her confidence

Having gained weight due to the upset caused by the failed tummy tuck, Ms Adams was told she needed to lose a stone and a half before she could even be considered for an operation.

Astonishingly, she managed to lose the weight in just 10 weeks and finally went under the knife to have the damage repaired.

During the lengthy operation, Dr Sassoon was forced to remove 626g of tissue, including internal scar tissue and the lump itself.

She also fixed the scars that left Ms Adams hating her body and completed the tummy tuck the Czech surgeon had botched. 

'It's been a long emotional road,' says Ms Adams, who is delighted with her new-look stomach. 'It's the end of a book and a new chapter is opening for me. 

'I have so much more confidence than I ever had before. It is what I should have had in the first place.'
