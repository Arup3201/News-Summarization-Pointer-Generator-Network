The Moscow billionaire who recruited Lord Mandelson as a director of his major Russian company has been held under house arrest and accused of money laundering.

Vladimir Yevtushenkov, 65, chairman of AFK Sistema, is being probed in Russia for obtaining shares in an oil company by 'criminal means'.

The move against one of the country's most successful and respected tycoons stunned business circles in Moscow, already reeling from the impact of Western sanctions and a plunging rouble which sank this week to its lowest-ever level against the dollar.

There are fears that the action is 'political' and it has been likened to the arrest in 2003 of oil baron Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who held in jail for more than a decade.

Yevtushenkov - who has a fortune of £5.5 billion - recruited the Labour peer - a former senior government minister and EU commissioner - last year to the board of Sistema, a conglomerate with significant interests in the energy, technology, banking, retail, telecoms and tourism sectors.

The tycoon strongly denies any wrongdoing, saying the accusations are 'completely groundless'.  'We are going to use all our energy to contest it,' said a spokeswoman.

He has been placed under house arrest for two months and barred from any external contacts except with his lawyers and investigators.

If found guilty he could face up to seven years in jail.

Analysts say that Yevtushenkov was embroiled in a battle with close Vladimir Putin associate Igor Sechin - head of the Rosneft energy giant - for control over oil company Bashneft.

'Investigators
 have reasonable grounds to believe that Sistema Board Chairman Vladimir
 Yevtushenkov is involved in the legalisation of property acquired by 
criminal means. He was accused of money-laundering,' said the powerful 
Russian Investigative Committee.

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was 'wrong and absurd' to claim political motives behind the arrest.

He acknowledged the Kremlin leader was following developments.

'The president expressed hope that investigators would conduct an unbiased probe and find answers to all questions,' he said.

However, the head of a big business lobby group directly compared it to the Khodorkovsky case 'because the charges apply to the head of a company that paid $2.5 billion for assets and is now accused of stealing shares and money-laundering'.

Khodorkovsky's oil company Yukos was dismantled with Rosneft the main beneficiary of its assets.

'Without doubt this looks very like 'Yukos Mark Two,' said  Alexander Shokhin, head of the Russian Federation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.

Khodorkovsky said that Yevtushenkov was 'stubborn' in rejecting an offer for his shares.

'So it was decided to use the familiar old method,' he said.

The case is bound to further dent business confidence in Russia which has taken a pounding since the start of the Ukraine crisis.
