You may be forgiven for thinking you're seeing double but this bathroom at the Sochi Olympics venue in Russia does in fact features two toilets situated side-by-side.

The photograph of the unusual cubicle inside the cross-country skiing and biathlon center has sparked an international Twitter storm after it was posted online.

BBC Moscow reporter Steve Rosenberg took the picture when he went to use the bathroom during a visit at the site ahead of next month's Winter Olympics in Sochi.

He uploaded the image to Twitter alongside the words: 'Seeing double in the Gentlemen's Loo at the Olympic Biathlon Centre' and the picture instantly went viral.

Although 'dual-toilets' are not common in Russia, social media users managed to post images of other side-by-side toilets from across the country, including ones in a courthouse and a cafe.

But the editor of the state R-Sport news agency said such communal toilets are standard at Russian soccer stadiums.

'Why are the BBC folks scaring us?' Vasily Konov wrote in this personal Twitter account. 'This is what the gents look like at football stadiums in Russia.'

He posted a photo showing two urinals and three toilets in a large room.

Meanwhile, others linked it to the country's controversial ban on 'gay propaganda', which led to calls from international campaigners to boycott February's games.

Others claimed the second toilet was for a security guard in a nod to the tight security measures imposed in Sochi for the Winter Olympics.

The Sochi organizing committee refused to comment on the picture. The games start on February 7.Â
