Nearly a million patients are heading to A&E every year because they cannot get an appointment with their GP, figures reveal.

Data from the Government’s own survey provide fresh evidence that Britain’s casualty ward crisis has been driven by the struggle to access a family doctor.

David Cameron yesterday said the pressures would be eased by giving the over-65s better access to GPs and more care at home – but conceded it would ‘take time’.

Nearly a million patients are heading to A&E every year because they cannot get an appointment with their GP, figures reveal

Labour tried to blame the Tories for a lack of appointments, but failed to admit that its botched GP contract in 2004 had awarded doctors huge pay rises but allowed them to stop out-of-hours and weekend working.

However some doctors last night revealed that a drug-resistant strain of flu could be contributing to this year’s A&E crisis.

At least one hospital said it is seeing rising numbers of patients with the influenza A H3 virus, a severe strain that had mutated since a commonly-used vaccine was prepared.

The political row over access to GPs broke out over a Government survey of 880,000 patients. It revealed that about one in ten were unable to get an appointment with a doctor or practice nurse when they last tried – a figure of 5.8 million patients if extended across England. A further 7 per cent were offered appointments up to three weeks ahead – and said they gave up trying.

Of these two groups of patients, one in ten said they went to an A&E or walk-in centre in the hope of seeing a doctor sooner. Across England, this is equivalent to about 940,000 patients – and a rise of almost 80,000 compared with calculations for last year.

The Prime Minister told a meeting of business leaders in Manchester that the problem was caused by a rising ageing population finding it ever harder to see a family doctor.

Parked side by side outside a Welsh A&E unit, 11 ambulances are forced to wait because casualty staff are too overwhelmed to accept patients.

The picture, taken outside Wrexham Maelor hospital, exposes the scale of the crisis in Wales’s Labour-run NHS – where waiting times are even longer than those in England.

Such scenes are by no means isolated, either, and on Monday there were 12 ambulances queuing outside the Heath hospital in Cardiff.

Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, blamed the crisis on a result of a ‘vicious cycle’ of under-funding by Labour.

‘Despite the best efforts of dedicated Welsh NHS staff, ambulance response targets have not been met in Wales for several years and A&E waits continue to worsen on Labour’s watch,’ he said.

The Mail last year revealed the scale of the NHS crisis in Wales, where patients have died on waiting lists and thousands are travelling to England for treatment.

But problems persist in England itself, and it emerged yesterday that a hospital in Sheffield has asked for help from the Red Cross – better known for helping Third World disaster victims. The charity is providing two ambulances and a team of staff at the city’s Northern General, while bosses have also asked nurses in managerial roles to return to frontline duties. Backroom staff have been shifted on to wards to do admin jobs for nurses.

An unprecedented 13 English hospitals have declared major incidents as they struggle to cope, as A&E waiting times plunged to their worst in a decade and just 92.6 per cent of patients were treated within four hours. But the figure is even worse in Wales – at just 83.8 per cent.

Firemen have already warned that they were increasingly being asked to ferry patients to hospital instead of ambulances. 

It emerged yesterday that fire crews cut the ring off a stroke patient’s swollen finger because an ambulance was not expected for five hours.

He said: ‘One blinding statistic is that there are a million more over-65s going to A&E this year than there were four years ago. So we have an ageing population, greater numbers of frail elderly.’

Labour, which analysed the survey figures, blamed the Government for under-investment in services to meet the needs of an ageing population.

It said surgeries were too cash-strapped to open at evenings or weekends, employ extra doctors and nurses or open bigger premises.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham repeated his claim that the NHS will not ‘survive another five years of David Cameron’, adding: ‘He’s made it harder to get a GP appointment and it’s getting even worse, contributing to the current crisis in A&E.’ He claimed a Labour government would guarantee a GP appointment within 48 hours and allow patients to book further ahead with a GP of their choice.

But the Tories pointed the finger at the 2004 GP contract – negotiated under Labour – which enabled doctors to opt out of evening and weekend care. Patients now have to navigate a confusing system of out-of-hours firms and walk-in centres – and many just go to A&E instead.

A Government spokesman said Labour was making another attempt to distract from the botched 2004 GP contract. ‘That’s a real source of pressure on A&E, and one we’re sorting out by introducing evening and weekend GP access for ten million people,’ said the spokesman.

Figures from the survey also show a steady fall in patient satisfaction. A fifth say they are not happy with GP opening hours.

One in ten said receptionists were unhelpful and a quarter said it was difficult getting through on the phone.

Meanwhile separate figures show ambulance response times at their worst since records began in 2010. Just 71.8 per cent of the most serious ‘Red 1’ calls – cardiac arrests and road accidents – were reached in eight minutes. The target is 75 per cent.

Yesterday doctors also warned that a strain of flu not covered by seasonal vaccines is contributing to a significant rise in A&E admissions.

Specialists at Southampton General Hospital said the number of patients admitted with respiratory illnesses had doubled – half of which were found to have the influenza A H3 virus.

Dr Ben Marshall said the virus – a severe strain that had mutated since the vaccine was prepared – was adding ‘significant strain’ to stretched hospitals. Colleague Dr Tristan Clark said national cases were rising steadily and could continue for eight weeks.

He said the ‘flu season’ began four weeks ago – earlier than last year, and admissions are up ‘significantly’.
