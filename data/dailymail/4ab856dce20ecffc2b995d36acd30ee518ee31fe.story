She was dubbed Queen of the high-street for her thrifty outfit choices throughout Wimbledon, but it seems that Kim Sears is keen to leave her bargain-loving reputation behind.

The 26-year-old, who once favoured the likes of Topshop and Zara, pulled out all the stops in the style stakes for her visit to Buckingham Palace this morning.

Andy Murray’s girlfriend donned a striking £934 graphic print dress by British designer Matthew Williamson and a £625 Jane Taylor beret as she watched her tennis ace boyfriend become an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

New look: Andy Murray and his long time girlfriend Kim Sears, who looked sophisticated and regal, arrived at Buckingham Palace in central London, where he became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)

The Wimbledon champion received the honour from the Duke of Cambridge, who was hosting his first investiture ceremony on behalf of the Queen.

Loyal Kim was all smiles as she joined Andy's parents Judy and Will to celebrate her boyfriend's success.

Kim swapped her usual High Street favourites for the monochrome dress by Matthew Williamson, who is a favourite of Sienna Miller and the Geldof sisters.

Whilst she kept her look smart, she still proved she is in keeping with the seasonal trends.

In a nod to autumn's grunge look, Kim showcased her style credentials with a leather studded clutch bag. 

Style credentials: Whilst Kim usually favours high-street styles, she showcased a more elegant and high-end look at the palace today and sported a £625 Jane Taylor beret

She kept her jewellery simple, wearing only a delicate silver necklace and her hair was styled into a messy chignon – a far cry from the tousled waves she usually sports.

Kim completed her look with a £620 ‘Elvie’ velour felt beret with ruffle detail by Jane Taylor.

Proving she had taken every aspect of her look into account, Surrey-born Kim matched her nail varnish to her burgundy beret.

Murray arrived at the palace on time with girlfriend Kim Sears and his parents Willie and Judy in a chauffeur-driven people carrier.

The group looked relaxed as they posed for photographs and then walked inside the Queen's official London home for the start of the ceremony.

William was presenting awards to recipients from across the UK, including an OBE to Vicar Of Dibley producer Jon Plowman and an MBE to presenter Aled Jones.

Touching: Judy Murray, famed for being Andy's number one fan, tweeted a snap of her son with his award with the caption: 'Yes, I cried #OBE'

the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, Princess Marie of the Netherlands, and

headpieces? and more recently The Countess of Wessex regular client and

Paul's cathedral for the thanksgiving ceremony and the other when 
touring the Solomon Islands with The Duke of Cambridge.

headpiece by Jane Taylor for the Diamond Jubilee while Sophie, Countess
