Rob Ayley sent an email a day before he departed Amsterdam to his family telling them he was looking forward to seeing his children

A New Zealand father-of-two who died on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 sent an email to his wife a day prior to his departure telling her that he was 'looking forward' to seeing his children when he returned home.

British-born Kiwi Rob Ayley, 29, was preparing to fly home aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 when he sent the email to his wife, Sharlene, telling her to expect his arrival on Saturday if 'we don't talk before hand.'

It would be the final contact Mr Ayley would have with his family, including his two sons Seth, 4, and Taylor, 2.

He had been away for a month visiting Rottweiler breeders in Europe - a breed of dog he loved.

'I'm just looking forward to seeing the boys and Sharlene. It's been a long, long journey,' he said in an email, the Dominion Post reported.

'We've seen the world's greatest Rottweilers, we have established contacts, and made life-long friends,' the email stated.

'But now I'm just ready to come home. I hope all is well, if we don't talk before hand, I will see you on Saturday.'

The family, who had prayed that Mr Ayley had not board the flight, released a statement shortly after learning of his death that described him as 'passionate about life.'

His parents Jonn and Wendie also live in Wellington, New Zealand.

'He found in his boys two little people he could love, understand and trust. When they cried they were sad, when they laughed they were happy and when they hugged it was because they loved him,' the family said.

It described the pair as soul mates - a couple who bonded over a mutual love of one another.

'She held his heart and he held hers. Rob will live forever in his family.'

Wendie said the family spent yesterday hoping he had somehow missed his flight, before the awful news was confirmed.

'He lived for his family and he lived for his rotweillers,' she said. 

Rachel Brown, the sister of Sharlene, who according to Facebook is living in Western Australian said in a Facebook post she would try to return to New Zealand soon to be by her sister's side.

'My heartfelt sympathies go out to my beautiful sister Sharlene Ayley and her two beautiful boys on the devastating loss of her husband and the Boys daddy Rob on flight MH17.'

'I will try to come home as soon as possible sis.'
