Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies today admitted Ebola keeps her awake at night, adding she is worried the virus will reach UK shores

Britain's chief medical officer today admitted Ebola keeps her awake at night, adding she is worried the deadly virus will reach UK shores.

But Dame Sally Davies added reassurance, while she is concerned about the disease reaching Britain, she is confident it will not spread.

She told BBC Radio 4's Life Scientific programme the country is well prepared in the event of a case being diagnosed in a British hospital.

'This is a tragedy for the people of West Africa, it is at the moment, out of control and people are dying, the dead are left in the street,' she said.

'Clearly I worry about it coming in to Britain, but that is not a worry it will spread. 

'We have superb services that have done a lot of preparation.

'We have excellent contact tracing and our infectious disease services are second to none.

'But we have to be vigilant and make sure every part of the NHS picks people up, protects them and looks after them.

'Meanwhile I am very proud of this Government and what they are doing in Sierra Leone where we are leading the fight, while the US leads in Liberia and France focuses on Guinea.

'It is a really good start.'

Two weeks ago Dame Davies told MPs that all health service chiefs had been asked to confirm that steps had been taken to ensure isolation rooms were available and staff knew how to react should an Ebola victim walk into a hospital.

She sought to play down the threat to the UK, insisting the present evidence suggests no more than a handful of cases.

And she dismissed reports the virus could be transmissible through the air. 

Addressing the Commons health select committee, Dame Davies said emergency exercises carried out across the NHS have shown preparations were going 'rather better than I dared hope'.  

She told MPs she shared their concerns about the level of preparedness across the health service but said she was reassured by Public Health England that efforts were on track.

A vaccine to protect millions from the Ebola virus decades after it was first detected does not exist because the disease previously only affected poor African nations.

The head of the World Health Organisation's scathing conclusion came as nearly 5,000 people have lost their lives to the hemorrhagic fever - the majority in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. 

WHO director general Dr Margaret Chan addressed the regional committee for Africa in Benin

Dr Margaret Chan, director general of the WHO, criticised drugs companies for turning their backs on 'markets that cannot pay'.

She said the current outbreak - the most deadly in history - has exposed two WHO arguments 'that have fallen on deaf ears for decades'.  

Addressing the regional committee for Africa in Benin yesterday, Dr Chan said: 'Ebola emerged nearly four decades ago. Why are clinicians still empty handed, with no vaccines and no cure?

'Because Ebola has historically been confined to poor African nations.

'The R&D (research and development) incentive is virtually non-existent.

'A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay.

'WHO has been trying to make this issue visible for ages. Now people can see it for themselves.' 

'A lot of work is going on. It is improving day by day. There is more work to be done,' she said.

'Every casualty is now working to develop an isolation room and make sure their personal protection equipment is handy and there is work ongoing to ensure that people are trained in its use.'

She went on: 'Remember how low the risk is: if they have started now and it happens in the next week or so that should be satisfactory.

'NHS England have today sent a letter to every chief executive in the NHS with a checklist for assurance purposes asking them to sign that off.'

'I share your concern. What I have heard last night and this morning makes me think we are well on the way to the best place we could be.'

Committee chair Sarah Wollaston - a GP - said one accident and emergency doctor had contacted her to say that he was not even aware of where protective clothing was kept.

Dame Sally said all staff, and not just clinicians, needed to be made aware.

'I think they should know where it is and how to put it on and - more importantly - how to take it off, but actually to have agreed who would be the first to do it because not everyone would need to.

'The first response is "hello, ah, if you may have Ebola, I would like you to sit in this room, here is a glass of water and I am shutting the door while I call in some experts and we make sure we know what we do".'

'They need to raise their awareness and it would be very good for infection control generally.

Dame Sally claimed she was ' not sleeping because we are working so hard' to deal with the threat of Ebola.

There were at present 12 specialist beds available, she said, but more could easily be added if required.

'I'm sure that if we had to we could open Ebola wards.'

She repeatedly sought to reassure the public over reports that the virus could mutate to a strain that could be spread in the air not, as at present, only via bodily fluids.

Analysis by experts at the Government's Porton Down laboratories had found 'no suggestion' it was on such a course, she said.
