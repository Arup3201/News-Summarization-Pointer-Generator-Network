Tragic: City workers Elsa Carneau, 25, seemed 'euphoric' moments before she died, a witness said

A City high-flier who died after she was found unconscious in the pool at her health club was acting ‘extremely exuberantly’ and had empty alcohol bottles in her handbag, an inquest heard.

Elsa Carneau, 25, a former lingerie model, was discovered face down in the water after she made a series of ‘bizarre’ and ‘strange’ remarks to swimmers including that she swam underwater as she found it peaceful.

The French national was pulled from the water and staff at the Virgin Active club in Kensington, West London, attempted first aid, but she was pronounced dead at hospital.

The court heard how efforts by emergency services to revive her were hindered by a staff member at the gym who filmed Miss Carneau as she lay unconscious.

The jury at Westminster Coroner’s Court was shown CCTV footage of Miss Carneau, who worked as an analyst, getting in the pool in a red swimming costume at around 6pm on Saturday December 3, 2011.

She swam 23 lengths of the small pool, before getting out of the pool for 30 seconds, and then returning to swim two more lengths.

Rupert Hill, 46, who works in finance in the City and was a member of the gym, told the court that while he was swimming in the pool, he noticed that Miss Carneau was lying underwater and appeared to me holding her breath.

After she did not surface for around a minute, he pulled her out of the water and onto the side, and first aiders were called.

Mr Hill said that before Miss Carneau had been found underwater he had several conversations with her as they rested between lengths during which she appeared ‘euphoric’.

He said: ‘She seemed extremely exuberant in the way she was speaking. She made a couple of comments that were slightly strange.

Miss Carneau, a French national who worked with GLG Partners, had made 'bizarre comments' to others

‘She asked “Are you a professional swimmer?” I was swimming with a float, so I said “no, but I try”.’

Mr Hill said that when he told her that his children were half-French, she told him that if they went to the Lycee School in London ‘you get good grades but it will f**k you up’.

He added: ‘She said, “I only started learning to swim two months ago, but I can only do breaststroke underwater. I find it very peaceful under there”. I found it strange.

‘She said I’ve got a nose bleed, but she seemed perfectly well. There was no sign of blood. She didn’t seem stressed at all and I thought I must have misheard.

‘She offered me her goggles. I thought that was a strange thing. “She said at one point I hate the French”.

‘I wonder if swimming up and down lengths had some effect.’

The court heard that in the handbag found in Miss Carneau’s locker there were 10 Marlboro cigarettes and two small empty alcohol bottles.

Firefighters from a station that neighbours the gym who went to help before paramedics arrived criticised the gym staff for not carrying out first aid properly and for being a distraction.

Ben Young, a London Fire Brigade officer, said that one member of staff was filming them as they attempted to revive Miss Carneau.

He said: ‘I was quite shocked at what he was doing. When I told him to give me the phone he said, “you cannot take my phone I’m filming it in case she makes it, so she has something to remember”.’

Brian O’Keefe, the watch manager, added: ‘I was doing compressions when there was a flash of bright light. There was a member of staff filming on his mobile phone. I asked him to stop, it was a distraction.

‘He didn’t, so I asked a member of my team to stop him. He just seemed to be looking in fascination.’

Mr O’Keefe said that the lead first aider at the gym was ‘behaving more emotionally than practically’. He said he believed that CPR was not being done correctly and a defibrillator was not fitted properly.

He added: ‘I could see they were trying, but it was not working.

‘There was a doctor present but the doctor seemed overwhelmed also.’

The inquest continues.
