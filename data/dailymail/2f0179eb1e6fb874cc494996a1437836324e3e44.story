A mother has swapped a successful career in the City to become another kind of high-flier - as one of the world’s top balloon artists.

Lucy Hennessy was working as a supervisor at a leading finance company before leaving the boardroom and is now winning competitions with her balloon wizardry.

Last month she wowed judges in an American competition by creating a pair of Russian dolls, a full-sized Formula One car and a complicated cupcake table decoration.

What a career change! Lucy Hennessy swapped a high-flying City career to become a balloon artist and now has her own successful company and enters competitions all over the world

The mother-of-three won four categories at the World Balloon Convention 2014 in Denver, Colorado, beating more than 100 entrants from all over the globe.

Lucy, 38, said: 'I used to work in the City but I left it behind about 13 years ago and started doing evening classes when I became pregnant with my son.

'It was a two-year course in balloon artistry at a college and I loved it so I started my business.

'I got into the competitions while teaching but only did them in the UK. I’d always wanted to go to America so when the competition came up, I thought I might as well just go for it.

Skills: Earlier this year, Lucy wowed judges in an American competition by creating a pair of Russian dolls, a full-sized Formula One car and a complicated cupcake design

Champion: The mother-of-three, who has her own company, won four categories at the World Balloon Convention 2014 in Denver, Colorado, beating more than 100 entrants from all over the globe

Passion: Lucy says her two oldest children, are both 'over' her interesting career, but youngest daughter Elsie, five, loves her job

'It’s a truly amazing experience to see about 900 people there watching, as well as the 30 I was up against.

'I was really pleased with the award I received.'

Lucy, of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, usually makes celebration sculptures for birthdays and weddings through her Balloon Power company - but admits she has received some weird requests in the past.

She said: 'With my company Balloon Power, I do a lot of hen parties, which are always fun. I’ve created all sorts of strange body parts out of balloons.

'I think my favourite sculpture I’ve ever done was years and years ago when I was asked to make a 6ft Viking for a party.

'I really enjoyed making that but I love doing any creation - you can make anything with a balloon, it’s great.

Award winning: Lucy once spent 27 straight hours and used 27,000 balloons as part of a 12-person team in a competition celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Red Arrows

'The strangest thing that’s happened to me was when we were at a competition and we made a huge Alice in Wonderland, which was fine, and then characters from the Wizard of Oz.

'It all looked great but someone nicked our balloon Toto from the stand. Luckily he had already been judged but he never surfaced again.'

Lucy says her two oldest children, George, 12, and Alice, nine, are both ‘over’ her interesting career, but youngest daughter Elsie, five, loves her job.

She said: 'It was Elsie’s birthday last weekend and she had a Disney party so I made lots of characters out of balloons for her.

'She loves what I do and thinks it’s really cool but the other two have got over it a bit. It’s much more exciting than telling their friends their mum works in finance though.

'I just think everyone will be relieved to have the house back, it’s been taken over by balloons most weekends because of the competition.'

Not a lot of hot air: Lucy swapped a high-flying City career surrounded by bankers to become one of the world's top balloon wizards - and it paid off
