The mother who gave birth to twin boys on the toilet, smothered them and dumped their bodies in a laundry basket sobbed in court yesterday as the jury heard disturbing details about how officers found the cold, dead newborns wrapped in bloody towels.

Two police officers choked up while testifying about how they discovered the twin boys after the father of Lindsey Lowe, 26, from Hendersonville, Tennessee, called 911 after making the grizzly discovery.

She gave birth in her parents' affluent home secretly in September 2011 and covered the newborn twin boy's mouths with her hand to stifle the screams so no one would hear.

Breakdown: Lindsey Lowe sobbed in court yesterday as grizzly details of the murder of her newborn twins were revealed to the jury

Scene: The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, at the two-story home in the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville

Dumped: The court was shown grizzly pictures of the laundry basket in which the dead newborns had been discarded by Lowe after she gave birth to them and smothered them

Blood: The bathroom were Lowe gave birth to her twins while she was on the toilet and then smothered them to stifle their screams

Grizzly discovery: Police find the tiny bodies of the newborn twin boys

Officer Jeremy Fentress took the stand
on Tuesday and described entering the bedroom of defendant Lindsey Lowe
and pulling back a bloody towel.

He stopped speaking for a few seconds, then told the court: 'After I pulled the bloody towel back, I saw a deceased infant.'

Fentress said he touched the baby with two fingers and found the infant was cold and not breathing.

The
newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, in the 
two-story home of the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville,
about 20 miles northeast of Nashville.

The
second baby was found by Sgt James Garrett, who described getting ready
to lay the first baby down on a bed 'softly and gently' before he 
discovered the umbilical cord, still attached to something deeper in the
basket.

Fentress held the
body of the first baby while Garrett pulled aside a sheet to uncover 
the second one – who was also dead. Garrett said he placed the first 
baby back in the basket beside his brother.

Lowe is facing two counts of first-degree murder at her trial, which opened Monday.

Jailed: Lindsey Lowe, now 26, faces to murder charges for her newborn twin sons but prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty

She had told police she gave birth to 
the twin boys in the bathroom of the home on the night of September 12, 
2011, and smothered them so that her parents would not hear their cries.

Both sides in the case agree that Lowe did not act like a pregnant woman in the days and weeks leading up to the birth.

Defense attorney John Pellegrin told 
jurors Lowe was a bridesmaid in a wedding the weekend before the birth 
where she was dancing, laughing and posing for pictures.

The night before the births, one of 
her sorority sisters stayed at her house, even sleeping in Lowe's bed, 
he said. And yet no one knew she was pregnant.

Prosecutors suggested that a lack of preparations showed Lowe never intended for the babies to live.

'Officers, during their search of the 
house, found no evidence of an expectation of life,' Assistant District 
Attorney Blanton said during opening statements.

'There were no diapers, no pacis (pacifiers), no blankets, no car seat.'

They pointed out that Lowe had been 
engaged to her college sweetheart in 2011, but had gotten pregnant when 
she had an affair with another man - who DNA tests later showed was the father of the twins.

'Miss Lowe made no preparation for the
births of these children because no one was going to interfere with her
life,' Blanton said in opening statements.

But defense attorneys argued that the case was not so simple. 

Evidence: The video of Lowe's police interview and eventual confession was played to the court today

Defense: Her attorney John Pellegrin, seen at her side in an earlier hearing, is arguing that she did not know that she was pregnant and was not of sound mind when she smothered the newborns to death

Court: Jury selection in the murder trial of Lindsey Lowe started Monday. She has pleaded not guilty

Diminished capacity: Defense lawyers' requests to have psychologists testify as to Lowe's mental state when she gave the statement were denied

'Lindsey Lowe was pregnant, but she refused to accept it, her mind refused to accept it,' Pellegrin said.

He argued that Lowe didn't realize what was happening when she started to give birth in the bathroom.

'She thinks her internal organs are coming out,' he told the jury.

Family, friends and church members have come to Lowe's defense.

In earlier hearings, Lowe's father 
Mark Lowe described her as a 'model daughter,' saying she moved back in 
with her family after graduating from Western Kentucky University in 
2008 and took care of her mother, who had a brain tumor.

The final witness Tuesday was Detective Steve Malach, who interviewed Lowe after the babies were discovered.

Upset: Lindsey Lowe cries as she listens to testimony while she sits with her attorney, John Pellegrin

He testified how Lowe told him she gave birth and then put the babies in a laundry basket.

When he asked if she ever checked on them, 'she said she couldn't face it,' he told jurors.

If convicted of first-degree murder, 
Lowe could face life in prison without parole. Prosecutors had said 
previously they would not seek the death penalty.

Testimony continues Wednesday.
