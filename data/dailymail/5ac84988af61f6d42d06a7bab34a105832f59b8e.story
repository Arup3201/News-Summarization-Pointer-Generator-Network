Nature lovers, gardeners and landowners have been warned against a toxic weed, nicknamed 'Taliban', which can burn and blister the skin of anyone who touches it.

Giant hogweed, which can reach
23ft high, originates from Afghanistan and Iraq and was shipped into the
 UK by Victorian plant hunters in the 19th century.

However,
 the Triffid-like plant spread out of gardens and 
private collections and across the countryside, while its sap can burn and blister the skin of anyone
 who touches it.

Hastily-introduced rules mean it is now illegal to plant hogweed in the wild - but nature experts say the ruling has come too late.

And because its stems are hollow, children playing in the countryside this summer are at risk if they pick them up to use as pretend telescopes or peashooters.

Giant hogweed has taken hold in many areas of the UK and the latest to be hit is the Avon Valley in Hampshire, where landowners are joining forces with the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust to stop it spreading further.

'We have fought against the giant hogweed since 2010 but more money is urgently required if we are to continue the battle effectively this year,' said Catherine Chatters, the trust's New Forest non-native plants officer.

The giant hogweed thrives on moist ground and once a river bank has become dominated by it, the plant blots out the sunlight and kills off rivals.

Eventually it becomes so dominant that it is virtually impossible to manage.

For the past few years the New Forest Non-Native Plants Project has funded treatment by professional contractors using approved herbicide along the banks of the Avon.

However, because of cutbacks to public funding, other sources of money now need to be foundto head off the risk of the hogweed invading waterside gardens.

'Each giant hogweed plant is capable of producing 50,000 seeds so it is vitally important the control work continues,' said Ms Chatters.

'If we stop now and allow the hogweed plants to produce seed, we could be back at square one in no time at all.'

The Royal Horticultural Society advises gardeners wanting to destroy invasive clumps of giant hogweed to first consider whether this can be done using non-chemical means such as digging out or suppressing with mulch, before using weedkillers.

Pull up young hogweeds by hand when 
the soil is moist - do this in May when the giant hogweed has reached a 
reasonable height, but before it has produced its flowering spike. For 
larger plants it might be necessary to loosen the roots with a fork 
first.

Never let hogweed 
set seed, but allow the flower spike to form and then remove it before 
the flowers fade. At this stage, the plant is less likely to survive 
trimming than earlier in the year.

Protect
 yourself from any skin contact with the sap, especially your face, when
 cutting stems, and carry out control measures in overcast weather 
avoiding sunny periods. Wash off any sap as soon as possible.

Chemicals
 in the sap can cause photodermatitis or photosensitivity, where the 
skin becomes very sensitive to sunlight and may suffer blistering, 
pigmentation and long-lasting scars.

Where these methods are not feasible, chemical controls may need to be used

Choose a weedkiller that is appropriate for purpose by reading the label carefully before buying or using. Particular care must be taken when using residual weedkillers.

When
 controlling giant hogweed always wear gloves, cover your arms and legs,
 and ideally wear a face mask when working on or near it.

Cut plant debris, contaminated clothing and tools are potentially hazardous too.

Wash any skin that comes in contact with the plant immediately.

Where there are many plants, try applying a tough weedkiller containing glyphosate.

Ideally, spray the foliage early in the summer and the plants should be re-treated in August or September, if necessary.

Alternatively, cut back flowering plants and then spray any young foliage that re-grows in August and September.

Mature plants are likely to need more than one treatment to kill them.
