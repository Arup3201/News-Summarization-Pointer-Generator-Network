Basketball great LeBron James has a history of flopping—or faking fouls to gain an advantage—but a recent display of on-court dramatics was so over-the-top it started a viral video craze of fans mimicking their idol.

It’s called LeBroning and is sure to show up at a shopping mall near you very soon.

The process is simple: while a friend takes video, the Lebroner ever-so-slightly bumps into an innocent passerby and then flops to the ground with as much flair as possible.

Super flop: This instance of James' alleged flopping from the Miami Heat's 2013 Eastern Conference Final game against the Pacers was a particularly dramatic flop that helped spawn LeBroning

The result is a hilarious jab at a the Miami Heat forward’s controversial habit.

The NBA first instituted rules last season in hopes of stopping the act of deceiving referees into making calls when there was little or no contact.

James’s most recent display of flopping prowess came just a day after he revealed to CBS his lax attitude toward the practice.

‘Guys have been accustomed to doing it for years, and it's not even a bad thing,’ he said. ‘You're just trying to get the advantage. Any way you can get the advantage over an opponent to your team win, then so be it.’

That advantage comes at a price.

Houston Rockets guard James Harden was fined $5,000 by the NBA on Monday for flopping and became the first player to get such a penalty.

Though a thorn in the side of referees and costly to guilty players, the practice has gifted the world a wealth of hilarious videos.
