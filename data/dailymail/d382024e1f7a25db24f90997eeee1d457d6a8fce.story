The family of a 13-year-old Oakland girl who was declared 'brain-dead' more than three months ago following complications after a routine tonsil surgery say the girl is showing signs of life now that she's been moved from the hospital that released her body to the coroner's office in early January.

Additionally, the family has slammed a state report that determined that the Children's Hospital Oakland - with which the family of Jahi McMath fought in court over whether to take the girl off of life support - complied with medical regulatory standards in its handling of Jahi's case.

Family members now say that while Jahi remains unconscious, she looks healthy and has been moving her head and legs on a regular basis.

In an interview with San Francisco 
Chronicle, Jahi's uncle Omari Sealy claims the teen tosses and turns in 
her hospital bed and has signaled that she is aware of what is going on 
around her.

Sealy 
claims his niece will turn in the direction of those who come to visit 
her in her hospital bed, which indicates that she's aware of what's 
going on around her.

'She 
moves so much, she can turn on her side,' he told the paper. 'They have 
to keep her bed rails up. They're afraid she could fall out of bed.'

However,
 medical experts say movements like that is not uncommon of people who 
are brain-dead - they say it is a product of muscle and spinal reflexes 
responding to the mechanical supports attached to their bodies.

The
 medical community believes that brain-dead people are not alive, and 
that a brain-dead person can survive on machines for several months but 
their condition ultimately will deteriorate.

'She definitely knows where she is and 
that we're present,' Sealy said. 'One of the misconceptions out there is 
that she's deteriorating or is going to deteriorate over time. But her 
skin looks better than mine.'

Doctors had told the family that as Jahi's condition continues to deteriorate, her skin would lose much of its complexion.

On
 Thursday, a report compiled by the California Department of Public 
Health concluded that the Children's Hospital Oakland met regulatory 
standards in its handling of Jahi's case - a conclusion the girl's 
family and the attorney that represent them do not accept.

In a series of tweets, Sealy dismissed the report as 'BS' and said the CDPH never interviewed the family.

'The State never interviewed the family 
who was THERE to witness Jahi bleeding to "CA brain death" & there 
is no answer why she bled?' Sealey wrote. 'What's 
done in the dark, will come to light.'

The
 state would not comment specifically on the girl's case, but issued a 
generic statement to the San Jose Mercury News saying that Jahi's case 
was reviewed in response to a complaint issued about her care.

Winkfield and her family are now in a renewed race against time to get their little girl transferred to a facility willing to care for a legally dead patient

'I am just thanking God and everyone who has supported us. I am going to fight with everything I have got,' Winkfield said Monday

'The California Department of Public 
Health conducted a comprehensive survey of care and services received by
 each patient sampled in the survey,' the agency said.

Additionally, the hospital defended the investigation and the results.Â 

Christopher
 Dolan, an attorney representing the girl's family, issued a statement 
of his own in response to the report, relegating the investigation to a 
case of doctors protecting doctors.

Dolan
 also says that even though the hospital was found to follow the general
 institutional criteria, it doesn't mean that there wasn't medical 
negligence in treating the girl.

Additionally,
 she says that her daughter is alive and not suffering - now that she's 
been moved from the Children's Hospital Oakland to a long-term care 
facility.

'I have been surrounded by the love, 
support and prayers of so many kind people,' Winkfield says in the letter. 'Despite what people say 
about my daughter being dead and how I must be ignorant not to get that,
 I can tell you that she is much better physically since she has left 
Children's Hospital and I see changes that give me hope.'

McMath was declared brain dead following a tonsil surgery intended to help the girl's sleep apnea on December 9.

Struggle: Jahi's family is pitted against a hospital they've called uncaring in their struggle to keep the brain dead teen hooked to life support.

Precautions: Officials saw to it that the door to the Children's Hospital of Oakland was barricaded Monday in preparation for Jahi's family's press conference

Tragedy: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared legally 
brain-dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal that dosctors 
suggested as a means of eliminating her sleep apnea

Unexpected: After coming out of surgery, Jahi 
started bleeding from the mouth and was eventually ruled brain-dead. The 
hospital that performed the procedure no longer wants to keep the girl 
on life support

Following
 the surgery, the girl suffered tremendous blood loss and went into 
cardiac arrest. The poor circulation as a result of the severe blood 
loss caused injuries to her brain that doctors considered to be fatal.

On December 12, doctors declared the 
girl brain dead and sought a medical declaration of death for the 
13-year-old. Her family, however, refused to accept the doctors' 
decision to declare the girl dead - while technically brain dead, the 
girl's organs were being kept alive by machines.

The disagreement led to court proceedings to determine whether the family had the right to keep McMath on life support.

The
 family petitioned the Alameda County Superior Court to step in when 
doctors wanted to take McMath off of life support. The court then 
appointed Paul Graham Fisher, the
 chief of Child Neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine, to 
give a second opinion on the girl's condition.

Fisher
 agreed with the doctors at Children's Hospital, noting that McMath had 
no activity on an electroencephalogram, no blood flow to the brain and 
she was unable to breathe on her own.

Winkfield
 appealed the decision to take her daughter off of life support, and the
 court gave her an extension that required the hospital to keep her on a
 ventilator until January 7.

The court, however, denied a request to give McMath a feeding tube or a tracheostomy.

On January 5, the hospital released McMath's body to the county coroner, which released the body to Winkfield.

McMath currently is being kept alive on life support at an undisclosed location.
