The National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) has produced some of the Australia's most successful and wealthiest actors, directors, screenwriters and costume designers.

But the Sydney drama school - touted as being one of the best in the world - is not sharing in the profits of some of its most famous alumni.

Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington and Mel Gibson are just a few among the big names to have graduated from NIDA, but according to The Sydney Morning Herald the institute recorded a loss of $792,764 last financial year.

The chairwoman of NIDA Jennifer Bott told the publication the loss was greater than expected, and put the institution in a worse position than the previous year.

Ms Bott also revealed that the four years prior saw a combined surplus of $1.5 million, in anticipation of a new business model which would be rolled out between 2012 and 2015.

Contributing to the school's loss was a ten percent increase in the bill for staff wages to a total of more than $11 million, while an overhaul of the institute's courses and technology was also a factor in the deficit.

'There were additional financial costs associated with this increased activity, especially in terms of depreciation and increased casual salaries, which resulted in a larger deficit than anticipated', Ms Bott said.

Among NIDA's celebrated alumni are renowned director Baz Lurhmann, his wife Catherine Martin who is Australia's most awarded Oscar winner, and actresses Jessica Marais and Judy Davis.

Famous Australian faces who missed out on a spot at the acting school include Rachel Griffiths, who came to fame following romantic comedy Muriel's Wedding, a film that also starred Toni Collette who dropped out of NIDA during her second year.

Anthony LaPaglia of Without A Trace fame was also rejected from the prestigious institute.

A former board member at NIDA Chris Puplick penned an essay back in 2012 criticising the institute's running and blaming mass staff departures on the mechanics of the school.

Despite the unfortunate finances of the institution, Ms Bott said applications for NIDA were still on the rise, and it still held a strong place within the arts and entertainment industry.

In 2013, the Hollywood Reporter ranked NIDA the eighth best drama school worldwide. They put the Juilliard School in New York City - attended by the likes of Kevin Spacey and Robin Williams - in the top spot.
