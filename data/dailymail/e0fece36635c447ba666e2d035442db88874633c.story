This Jack Russell was found wandering the streets of Poole dressed in a festive red and white coat

This lonely dog  was found wandering the streets dressed as Father Christmas  - and now faces spending the festive period alone after being separated from his owners.

The adorable Jack Russell was found wandering the streets of Poole, Dorset, dressed in a tiny red Father Christmas coat with a white felt collar and belt.

Dog wardens had hoped to reunite the dog with his owners before Christmas Day - but no one has come forward.

Becky Corbin, an animal welfare officer at Poole council, said: 'He was wearing the Christmas outfit with a camouflage coat underneath when we found him.

'There was no one around at the time I picked him up, apart from a boy on a paper round who found the dog wandering on the street.

'He appears to be looked after but that is only our initial understanding.

'He has enjoyed playing with a tennis ball.

'The dog will be kept in the possession of the council for seven days, then we will look to re-home him.'

Animal charity Dogs Trust is reminding families that a dog is for life and not just for Christmas.

Previously Giles Webber, responsible for rehoming at Dogs Trust's 20 rehoming centres said: 'With more and more puppies flooding the Christmas market, all available at the click of a button, it is more essential than ever that our message "A Dog is For Life, Not Just For Christmas" is ingrained in people's minds.

The UK dog population as of 2013 is estimated at 8.5 million and an estimated seven in 10 of all stray dogs are Staffordshire Bull Terriers.

According to Save the Strays more than 126,000 dogs are picked up by local authorities across the UK each year.

 Of those more than 30,000 homeless dogs are sent to rescue centres every year to be re-homed, and more than 7,000 end up being euthanised every year when a home cannot be found. 

In 2013 30 per cent of dogs were abandoned in the first three months of 2013 alone, with financial difficulties and relationship breakdowns the most common reasons dogs are abandoned.

More than half, 54 per cent, of pets whose owners break up are abandoned after couples can't decide who should keep the pet.

In 2013 Battersea Dogs and Cats home cared for 5,421 dogs in 2013 and has around 400 dogs across its sites or on foster at all time.
