It is said to give energy and boost a flagging sex drive but this local Peruvian blend is not for the faint-hearted.

Tourists in the country have been sampling a popular drink that is available to buy from vendors on street corners across the capital: fresh frog juice.

A video that appeared on YouTube shows a man drinking a green smoothie that contains a whole frog after it has been put through a blender with various herbs and spices.

What's cooking?: A frog is heated up as a Peruvian vendor prepares a frog drink for a customer

Preparation: The vendor cleans the four-legged morsel before it's cooked and blended up

Frog in a blender: Not like it, it is an actual frog being blitzed up for human consumption

Take the strain: The liquid, once blended, needs to be strained before it's served up

Mmmm: A traveller doesn't need to be asked twice to down the green beverage

Tasty: A tourist shows his empty cup after downing a frog milkshake

The video below, which contains images that some people may find disturbing, shows a tourist selecting a frog to add to his drink from a tank below a shop counter.

The vendor plucks the unlucky amphibian from the tank, kills it with a knife and then skins it before cooking it in a pan on a small counter-top stove.

The 
mixture is then poured into a blender and whizzed into a juice, while 
the man filming it can be heard to say: ‘Bones and all, people, bones 
and all!’

Energy drink: Frog juice is popular in Lima where locals believe it can boost stamina and sex drive

The green liquid is then poured through a sieve into a bowl as the tourists joke about getting all the ‘hair, teeth and eyeballs out’.

The vendor pours the finished drink into a cup and passes it to one of the 
tourists who downs the entire serving, proudly high-fiving the cameraman as he shows off the empty cup.

A second man then drinks the remainder of the mixture from the bowl with an added extra - a shot of vodka.

Fresh frog juice - or Jugo de Rana - is popular in Peru and many people believe it gives them strength.

Along
 with the main ingredient, many vendors add honey, aloe vera, malt and 
maca - a root vegetable that is believed to boost stamina and sex drive.

The so-called ‘Peruvian Viagra’ costs just a couple of dollars and locals believe it can also cure asthma and bronchitis.
