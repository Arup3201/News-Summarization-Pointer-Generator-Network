A Wisconsin couple have their hands full caring for two new additions to their family, after they adopted twin bear cubs that had been rejected by their mother.

David and Lana Fechter, who run a wildlife reserve on their West Bend property, took in the male cubs from a Chicago zoo.

And while they are small and adorably cute, the couple say the nine-week-old Siberian bear cubs are keeping them on their toes.

Curious: The inquisitive cubs have been named Lewis and Clark after the American explorers

At the moment the cubs are in an inside enclosure, and are being bottle fed, but when they are a bit bigger they will live on the Shalom Wildlife reserve.

The inquisitive bears have been named Lewis and Clark after the first explorers to venture into the unchartered West.

'They're like a 2-year-old where they get into everything,' Mr Fechter told WISN, adding that they needed a lot of attention.

'They're already starting to get their own personalities, and we need to respect them,' he added.

The cubs, who could grow to be 
1,000lb, will be given a large natural enclosure to live in, as soon as 
they become more independent.

'We are going to build a huge environment 
for them. It will be a two-acre pen with a pond and ridges,' Mr Fechter said. He added that the bears are friendly but 'they are still grizzly and will always have to be treated with caution and respect.'

Nap time: Tired from all their exploring, Lewis and Clark take a snooze on a chair

Mr Fechter told Mail Online that Lewis and Clark, who were six weeks old when they adopted them, are the park's first bears.

Although the cubs are relying on the couple for their basic needs at the moment, Mr Fechter said generally they try to raise all their animals in as natural an environment as possible.

'When possible we want the mother animal to raise their young, we only help out when need be,' he said.

The couple have been running the Shalom reserve after buying a parcel of land about an hour from Milwaukee to preserve it.

The 100-acre reserve has three miles of trails that visitors can hike through, or drive golf buggies on, to view elk, wolves, bison and other species in a more natural environment.

With more than 200 native animals on 
show, the park has kept to its founding philosopshy from when it started
 in 1979: 'To preserve the prairies, wetlands, forest, lake habitat and 
the wildness, while providing enjoyment and education.'

The
 park opens in May, just in time for its baby boom. For those who can't 
wait, Lewis and Clark are regularly featured on the reserve's Facebook page.

A fundraising account has been set up for the cubs, and anyone wanting to donate can do so via the Lewis and Clark Bear Fund, National Exchange Bank and Trust 1320 West Paradise drive West Bend Wisconsin 53095.Â
