With his forked tongue, razor-sharp fangs and horns that poke from his forehead, Diablo Delenfer, 43, from Kent, looks like most people's idea of a terrifying demon.

Now the former security guard and self-described 'body modification artist' is to have screws implanted into his skull in a bid to create a devilish metal mohawk.

But because 'body modification' is unlicensed and unregulated in the UK, the entire operation will be done without anaesthetic.

Terrifying: Delenfer, 43, has spent £10,000 on his bid to look exactly like Lucifer - complete with devilish horns

Transformation: Delenfer in 2009 at the beginning of his quest to become Beelzebub's doppelganger

'Everything I've done, I've done fully 
conscious, fully awake,' he explains. 'You see the needle coming towards you and that's
 really stressful. You can't be scared of pain if you're the Devil Man.'

Among the operations that Diablo Delenfer - real name Gavin Paslow - has so far endured are having his tongue sliced in two to fork it, sub-dermal implants to create a set of horns and an eyeball tattoo that has turned the whites of his eyes bright red.

But despite the pain, the 43-year-old insists he has no plans to stop. 'I describe myself as a body modification
 artist,' he explains.

'I am a human curiosity but body modification is my life's 
journey. It's a little bit weird, a little bit eccentric but that's what
 I am.'

He adds: 'I chose to become the Devil Man because everything
 else has been done, whether here or in America. I'm not Satanic at all - it's 
just a piece of fun.'

It's certainly an expensive piece of fun, with Delenfer confessing to spending more than £10,000 on his transformation so far.

'Over the years, it's probably cost me £10,000 to look like this,' he explains. 'Being a Devil Man doesn't come cheap!'

It hasn't been cheap for the taxpayer either: In 2009, Delenfer was caught swindling £3,552 by making a series of fraudulent benefit claims and was sentenced to 200 hours of community service.

Speaking outside court after the trial, the divorced father-of-two said: 'I was really constrained by money and I just wanted to have these modifications done so I used my benefit money to pay for some of them.

'It was a stupid mistake and I'm really sorry. I'm paying it all back. I really regret it.'

He added: 'But I'm pleased with my look so far, but what I really want is a tail. And not just a synthetic one - a proper, organic tail.' 

Inspiration: Lucifer as portrayed by French engraver Gustave Doré in a plate from Dante's Divine Comedy

While Delenfer is yet to realise his ambition of getting an organic tail, he has since had his ears made pointy and endured a series of painful tattoos that now cover his face and arms.

Although Delenfer says he's happy with his unusual looks, he does admit that looking like Lucifer has made his quest to find a girlfriend fraught with pitfalls.

'Relationships
 is a bit of a difficult issue to be honest,' he confesses. 'I'm looking for someone who
 can see beyond the mask.

'It has changed the way people look at me, accept and deal with me. It has made certain aspects like relationships 
difficult but it is my life journey and I ain't stopping!'

I
 do get a lot of attention from people walking down the street and I do 
have fun with it. Some people are scared and some don't understand but 
it is just a bit of fun. I'm not satanic at all, it's purely an image 
thing!
