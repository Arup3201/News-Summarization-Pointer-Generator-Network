Is obesity a disability or a self-inflicted condition triggered by a lack of willpower and overeating?

And should people who are overweight be protected by the same discrimination laws that were put in place to shield those who are wheel-chair bound, people with learning difficulties, hearing and visual impairments or those with autism spectrum disorders?

A landmark test case being brought before judges at the European Court of Justice today has sparked a vigorous debate on the issue.

The result of it may mean British companies will have to treat obese workers as 'disabled', making allowances for their size by providing larger seats and parking spaces closer to the office.

A landmark test case is being brought before judges at the European Court of Justice today by Karsten Kaltoft, pictured, which could result in obesity being classed as a disability for employers in the UK

Mr Kaltoft was sacked by his local authority in Denmark for being unable to perform his duties as a childminder because of his 25 stone size

Karsten Kaltoft is taking action after he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark for being unable to perform his duties as a childminder, due to his size.

The council, Billund Kommune, claimed the 25 stone childminder was so fat that he required help from a colleague to tie up children's shoelaces.

If successful in redefining obesity as a disability, Mr Kaltoft's lawyers could force widespread changes in the way bosses deal with staff.

Currently in the UK the law is clear, the Equality Act 2010 refrained from classing obesity as a disability.

Instead the Government definition is that a person is 'disabled under the Equality Act 2010, if they have a physical or mental impairment that has a 'substantial' and 'long-term' negative effect on a person's ability to do normal daily activities.'

However for many people living with a disability, they self-define themselves as such, basing their disability more on the barriers society puts in the way of them leading the life they wish.

For someone bound to a wheelchair steps to a cinema or restaurant, can provide a barrier and as a result a person is likely to class themselves as disabled.

Debating the issue on today's Good Morning Britain, writer and broadcaster Carole Malone and journalist Ursula Hirschkorn, explored both sides of the issue.

Ms Hirschkorn said: 'I am not sure it (obesity) should be treated as a disabilty.

'But what he is trying to say is if you are going to have anti-discrimination laws, they need to be universal.

'Should it distinguish between what employees you are going to protect and those you are not going to protect?

'It is not about saying if I am fat I am disabled, rather it is about if I can't do my job because I am fat, I deserve the same protection as someone who can't do their job because they are disabled, or pregnant.'

But journalist and writer Ms Malone argued obesity is not a disability, rather a self-inflicted condition brought on by people who cannot resist the urge to eat.

When asked whether people should be protected by anti-discrimination laws because they are obese, she said: 'Not in the case of people who self-inflict their disability.

'In the case of this Danish guy, he was 25st. All he needed to do was eat less doughnuts and less Danish pastries and he would have been able to bend down and tie the children's shoe laces.

Ms Malone argued in '95 per cent of cases' obesity is self-inflicted 'by people lacking discipline and self-control'

'But because he didn't, he couldn't. And clearly is literally not fit enough to look after those kids.

'If you can't bend down to tie your shoe lace you can't help them if they fall down, you can't react quickly enough if something happens.

'That man was clearly not suited to that job.'

Challenging Ms Malone's suggestion that 'obesity is self-inflicted in 95 per cent of cases', Ms Hirschkorn branded the statement 'unfair'.

She said: 'At the end of the day if you are completely drunk and take a dive into a shallow swimming pool and end up disabled, that is self-inflicted.

'I am not saying that person should not be protected but equally you don't know why people become fat, the vast majority of people become fat because they have psychological issues or health problems.'

Ms Malone responded: 'That is simply not true. We are both, I would say, a bit overweight (to which Ms Hirschkorn agreed). There is no disability, no psychological problem, I am overweight.

'The majority of people who are overweight have psychological problems, no they don't. The majority of people who are overweight have no discipline and no self-control.'

She added: 'The Equality Act 2010 ruled that obesity is not a disability.

'What is going to happen if this court ruling happens, it is going to punish people who are overweight because employers will not employ fat people, or people they think might get fat.

'Why should you get special treatment if you have abused your body knowingly - that is what a lot of obese people do.

'People generally get fat, in 95 per cent of cases, because they eat too much.'

Disability charity Scope asked users and supporters for their views on the debate, via Twitter and Facebook, yesterday.

The overwhelming response from members of the public was that obesity should not be classed as a disability.
