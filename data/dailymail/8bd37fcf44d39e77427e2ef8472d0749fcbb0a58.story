Neil Lennon will move to make Kris Commons his first signing as Bolton manager in January.

Lennon signed the midfielder for Celtic from Derby County for £300,000 in January 2011 and will now offer him the chance to return to the Championship with the Trotters.

Despite being the reigning SFWA and PFA Scotland Player of the Year, Commons hasn’t always been an automatic pick for Ronny Deila at Celtic Park this season.

Following his omission from the starting side which exited the Champions League at the hands of Maribor, Sportsmail revealed that the player was considering his future.

Deila has subsequently admitted he may have made an error by initially benching the 31-year-old that night.

So far, however, little progress has been made in talks between the player and the club with regard to extending his contract beyond the current season.

Lennon has admitted he could consider returning to Celtic for players as he bids to drag Bolton away from the foot of the Championship.

Commons tops that list but others – including Welsh defender Adam Matthews – are known to be in his thinking.

Former Scotland midfielder Commons was a revelation when he joined the Parkhead club midway through Lennon’s first full season in Glasgow, scoring 15 goals in five months.

He scored just once the following campaign but bounced back with 19 goals in season 2012-13 before hitting the net 31 times last term as he swept the individual prizes for players.

Commons has already indicated that he would prefer to stay in Glasgow but Lennon’s appointment at Bolton this week may prove a game-changer.

Meanwhile, Commons’ Celtic’s team-mate Stefan Johansen has been forced to deny that he deliberately slide tackled Bulgaria manager Ljuboslav Penev during Norway’s 2-1 victory in Oslo on Monday night.

The Parkhead player was voted man of the match after the Group H European qualifer but sparked controversy during the game when he followed through on a challenge near the touchline and took out the Bulgarian boss as well.

Johansen was booked for the incident after being surrounded by angry opponents and was later accused by Penev of deliberately barging into him.

‘I’m all right, but I’m convinced Johansen did it on purpose,’ said the manager after the match.

However, Johansen insisted it was an accident, saying: ‘I slide tackled him, but it was not intentional. We shook hands immediately afterwards. Then it was okay.’
