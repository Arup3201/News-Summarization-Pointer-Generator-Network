The bad luck continues for Eric Trump's bride-to-be Lara Yunaska, who took to Instagram on Saturday to shame her beloved dog Charlie after he 'rolled in poop' twice in one day, forcing the 31-year-old to suffer through two baths with him - and all with two broken wrists.

Lara, who suffered serious injuries to both of her wrists during a riding accident last month, posted a picture of the 'rotten dog' on the photo sharing app, along with a lengthy list of his misdemeanors.

'Odds that I break both of my wrists three weeks away from our wedding? Pretty darn slim,' she wrote.

In the doghouse: Naughty pup Charlie was caught 'rolling in poop' twice in one day, much to the frustration of his owner Lara Yunaska

Running free: Just minutes before Lara shared the shameful image of dog Charlie, she uploaded this photo of the pooch enjoying his walk at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester

'Odds that this rotten dog rolled in poop and I had to give him a bath (with two broken wrists, mind you) not once but TWICE today? Apparently pretty high #BuyingALotteryTicket #RottenDog #CharlieDog'

Just minutes before posting the image of the disgraced Beagle, Lara had shared another snap of her beloved pooch enjoying a walk at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, which is where Eric popped the question back in July - during a dog walk.

Keen followers of Lara's Instagram account will no doubt recognize Charlie the Beagle who is frequently featured in her photographs - and has even been credited with helping her through her injuries. Until now, that is.

Luckily it wasn't all doom and gloom for the poor bride-to-be who later posted a cute candid snap of herself and 30-year-old Eric in celebration of the one-week countdown to their wedding.

Alongside the picture, Lara wrote a simple caption, saying only: 'One week to go!!!!! #wedding #countdown #love' 

Wedding bells: Eric (L) and Lara are set to wed on November 8 

Part of the family: Beloved dog Charlie was part of Eric's proposal plans. The couple were out walking the miniature Beagle when the 30-year-old popped the question

'Thanks to my helper': When he's not busy misbehaving, Charlie has been a source of comfort to Lara while she recovers from her injuries 

The couple, who have been dating for six years, are set to marry in front of their friends and family at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, on Saturday.

They will begin the wedding festivities with a wine tasting at the Trump Winery on Friday November 7, followed by the black-tie ceremony on Saturday and a brunch on Sunday.

Last week, Lara's future father-in-law Donald Trump told MailOnline that the wedding would go ahead as planned, despite the bride-to-be's injuries. 

'Her fingers are exposed. So the ring is good,' he said. 'It's too bad. But she's really strong, and they dig each other, so that's important.'
