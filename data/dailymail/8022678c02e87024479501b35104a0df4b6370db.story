Steven Gerrard appears to be enjoying the perks of retiring from international football after being spotted on a night out with wife Alex Curran. 

The Liverpool, and former England, captain accompanied his wife on a trip to their friends' bar PRUSSIA, in Southport, Merseyside on Saturday night.

Alex, 32, stunned in a black one-armed mini dress with a sheer panel split that spanned all the way up one side.

Gerrard's former England team-mates are gearing up for a friendly north of the border, when they travel to Celtic Park to play Scotland on Tuesday night. 

With Gerrard retired from international football, and Liverpool without a match until they travel to Crystal Palace on Sunday, the 34-year-old midfielder is enjoying some down-time with his family.

Despite his non-involvement in the England set-up, Gerrard will surely have been pleased to see England continue their unbeaten run before heading out on the town.

Goals from Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck secured the win for the Three Lions, keeping them top of their Euro 2016 qualification group with maximum points.
