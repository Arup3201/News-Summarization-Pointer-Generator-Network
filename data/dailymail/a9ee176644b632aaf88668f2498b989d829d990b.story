Juventus have no plans to sell Paul Pogba in the near future.

The 21-year-old midfielder played a major role in helping Juve clinch their third successive scudetto last season, scoring seven goals and setting up seven more in 36 Serie A appearances for the Bianconeri.

Reports claim Manchester United are preparing a £77million bid to bring the France international back to Old Trafford this summer.

When asked about Pogba, Juve general director Giuseppe Marotta told Sky Italia: 'What was a promising player has become a reality.

'Every European club is watching him and have been in contact with us.

'We, however, want to have a strong team made up of champions.

'We have an important player in Pogba and we don't have a need to sell him.'

Pogba, who joined Juve from United on a free transfer in 2012, is also a reported target of Chelsea and Manchester City.

The Frenchman recently signed a contract extension with the Turin giants until June 2019.

'Is Pogba's price tag around €80million (£66million)? He is one of the most expensive players on the market,' Pogba's agent Mino Raiola told Italian radio station RAI.

'Considering his age, he has room for improvement and he is among the best.

'Of course, the asking price always depends on eventual buyers.'

Pogba scored a sensational volley to help Juve beat Napoli 3-1 in Naples on Sunday and increase his tally to four goals in 15 Serie A appearances.

Juve lead the league standings and are also alive in the Champions League and the Coppa Italia.
