A mosquito-borne disease that preys on the young and malnourished is sweeping across poverty-riven northern India.

Officials are worried it could be the deadliest outbreak of encephalitis in nearly a decade.

The disease has already killed at least 118 children this year, and authorities fear the death toll could reach about 1,000, said Dr. R.N. Singh of the Encephalitis Eradication Movement, an Indian nonprofit.

While India's efforts against polio and 
tuberculosis get plenty of attention, the poor farmers and day laborers 
of eastern Uttar Pradesh state face an almost-silent emergency, battling
a disease that has killed thousands of children over the past eight 
years.

The children who survive often cannot communicate because of brain damage and stare listlessly, unable to recognize friends they played with just months before.

Some are so severely disabled that their impoverished parents are told to abandon them

Many families have taken out crushing loans for treatment.

Sangita Devi's four-year-old son Anup Kumar has been in a hospital for four months.

'We have mortgaged our house for our son's treatment. But there is no improvement in his condition.

'He cannot even stand now,' she said.

Every year the monsoon fills the region's parched paddy fields, heralding the arrival of the mosquitoes that spread Japanese encephalitis from pigs to humans, devastating malnourished children with low immunity.

Another strain of the disease - Acute Encephalitis Syndrome - spreads through contaminated water. Residents use the fields for defecation, contaminating the ground water.

A vaccine has long been available, but the state government - which spent tens of millions of dollars building monuments to its last top politician - has failed to muster the sustained political will to focus on the communities hardest hit by the illness.

The disease killed more than 1,500 children in 2005, the worst recent year.

Errors: Health experts say the government has made repeated mistakes in the fight against encephalitis

Encephalitis is a mosquito-borne disease.

It’s common in rural areas throughout Southeast Asia, the Pacific islands and the Far East.

The very young and the very old are most at risk because their immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) tends to be weaker.

Most people infected by the Japanese encephalitis virus do not develop any symptoms, or they get only mild, flu-like symptoms. But in people who are seriously infected the virus can also cause swelling inside the brain (encephalitis), leading to increased pressure in the brain.

This can cause permanent brain damage. Japanese encephalitis.

The devastating disease can be fatal in around one in three people who develop these serious symptoms.

Shocked by the deaths, Uttar 
Pradesh's highest court in 2006 asked the state and federal governments 
to declare encephalitis a national health emergency. 'A concrete action 
plan must be drawn,' it said.

That
year the government started vaccinating children against Japanese 
encephalitis.

The government vowed to immunize every child in the 
worst-affected areas and to launch a massive drive to improve 
sanitation. For a couple of years, the numbers dropped. In 2006, the 
disease killed 431 children.

But the crowded hospital wards of the tiny town of Gorakhpur reflect how the immunization drive has fizzled out. Last year, more than 700 children died.

Health experts say the government has made repeated mistakes in the fight against encephalitis.

Most of the 7.5 million children vaccinated between 2006 and 2010 were given only a single dose of a two-dose vaccine, said Singh, of the Encephalitis Eradication Movement.

'Who is responsible for the children who died between 2006 and 2010?' Singh asked. In 2010 the vaccination drive suddenly stopped because funds dried up. The sanitation drive never fully started.

To make matters worse, in the 23 worst-affected districts in the state, only one hospital - the Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur - is equipped to deal with the hundreds of sick children. They fill its 108-bed encephalitis ward.

'By the time they reach here, it's too late,' said Dr. K.P. Kushwaha, who heads the hospital.

According to hospital data, 5,136 children with encephalitis died in its wards between 2005 and 2012.

This year, 118 children had died by the end of May. The figures don't include children treated at private clinics or those who never made it to medical care.

Survivors who develop brain damage, common among young children, have no rehabilitation centers despite a 2011 court order telling the state government to set them up.
