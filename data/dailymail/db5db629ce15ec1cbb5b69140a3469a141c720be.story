Still sporting his polar beard, a dressed-down Prince Harry takes his even more casual girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, out for a burger.

Admittedly it wasn’t any old burger bar.

The venue for their dinner date was Byron, the upmarket chain so beloved of Chancellor George Osborne, who was criticised for being out of touch when he Tweeted a picture of himself tucking into one of their take-aways while preparing his spending review last June.

Casual clothing: The Prince was still sporting the beard he grew during a charity trek to the South Pole, while Cressida was wearing a trendy orange beanie hat, skinny black jeans and fashionable Nike Air Max trainers

Local dining: The venue for their dinner date was upmarket chain Byron in Kensington High Street, London

A Byron burger with bacon cheese and dressing costs a tasty £9.25 - and that’s without fries, which adds an extra £2.95 to the price.

The 29-year-old prince popped out to his local branch in Kensington High Street, just a few minutes’ drive from his bachelor pad at Kensington Palace, with former dance student Cressida, 24, on Monday night.

Their show of togetherness scotched recent ill-founded reports that they had split up.

And the presence of Harry’s much-admired beard, which he grew during a charity trek to the South Pole in aid of Walking With The Wounded before Christmas, also put paid to claims that the Queen, who is said to dislike facial hair, had ordered him to shave it off.

Security: The pair - who were accompanied by two bodyguards - spent more than an hour in the restaurant before walking to the Prince's waiting car, driven by a third officer, and whisked away to Kensington Palace

Outfit: Harry was wearing a navy shirt and trousers with desert boots and a blue baseball cap pulled down low

Cressida was sporting trendy orange beanie hat, skinny black jeans, black bomber jacket and ultra- fashionable Nike Air Max trainers.

Her blonde hair had been plaited into two long braids, showing off her hooped gold earrings, and she was carrying a casual black rucksack.

An outfit unlikely ever to be seen on her potential sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge.

Harry was wearing a navy shirt and trousers with desert boots and a blue baseball cap pulled down low to disguise his face.

Relationship: Prince Harry and Cressida, pictured with a bodyguard, have been dating for more than 18 months

Back together: However, they have been forced apart of late - Harry spent Christmas with his own family as did Cressida, who then immediately jetted off to the Caribbean with her half-sister, Isabella Branson

The pair - who were accompanied by two 
bodyguards - spent more than an hour in the restaurant before walking to
 the prince’s waiting car, driven by a third officer, and whisked away 
to Kensington Palace.

The couple have been dating for more than 18 months and although they have been forced apart of late - Harry spent Christmas with his own family as did Cressida, who then immediately jetted off to the Caribbean with her half-sister, Isabella Branson - are said to be as ‘rock solid’ as ever.

The couple were introduced by Harry’s cousin and Cressida’s best friend, Princess Eugenie. In fact the trio were out on Saturday night together at Jak’s bar in the capital.

Cressida is the daughter of four times 
married and divorced former society girl Lady Mary Gaye Curzon - she has
 five children by three of her exes - who once scandalised her family 
when she posed semi naked covered in oil for the coffee table 
photographic book Birds of Britain.

Criticism: Chancellor George Osborne was criticised for being out of touch when he Tweeted this picture of himself tucking into one of Byron's take-aways while preparing his spending review last June

Cressida’s father is the businessman Jeffrey Bonas, Mary Gaye’s third husband. She is currently working for her half-brother, Charles Bonas, who runs a respected private tuition and educational consultancy firm.

Last year there was much talk of an engagement, although friends of Cressida have stressed to the Mail that she is still young ‘and has a lot she wants to do with her life yet.’

‘They enjoy each other’s company very, very much, but are just seeing how things go at the moment,’ said one.

‘There’s no pressure whatsoever on them yet.’

With Harry due to celebrate his 30th birthday later this year, however, might he be tempted to put a ring on his girlfriend’s finger yet?
