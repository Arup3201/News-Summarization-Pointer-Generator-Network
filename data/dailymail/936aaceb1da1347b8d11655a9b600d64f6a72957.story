Luke Donald may have been looking for a few birdies in the Nedbank Golf Challenge on Friday but he would never have expected to come across a baboon.

The former world No 1 was stood over his approach to the green in South Africa when he was alerted to the presence of the primate by caddie John McLaren.

Understandably surprised by the animal's appearance, the 36-year-old scarpered away from his ball as the muscular baboon skipped past Donald and onto the green.

After the round, Donald explained: 'We were walking up 13, saw one hiding in the tree, and got to my ball and suddenly Shane (Lowry, playing partner) said, 'Watch out!'".

'And I turned around and the thing is galloping towards me. I jumped out of the way.

'My facial expression I'm sure was caught on camera and probably on the internet already by now. It gave me a little bit of a fright as he strolled right by me.'

Donald tweeted after the incident (both above) and saw the funny side to his reaction after a fine round

Donald found the funny side when he tweeted: 'Couple of things happened to me that haven't happened in a while....one I shot 63, and two I let a baboon play thru on the course'

'The fact that my caddy Johnnie didn't even flinch, makes my reaction look even more pathetic!! #HeWasaBigBoyTho' 

The incident didn't sway Donald's form, though, as he finished the round ten over par, extending his lead over Ross Fisher into the weekend.

The Englishman had an average opening day on Thursday, shooting a one-under par round of 71, but showed the class which saw him top the world rankings in 2011, carding a nine-under par 63.

Donald, 34, made six birdies on the front nine and added three on the back without dropping a shot throughout.

That was enough to see him move clear of compatriot Ross Fisher, who had held the overnight lead heading into Friday's play at at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City.

'It's been a while since I've gone really low,' said Donald on the European Tour website.

'I've been seeing some signs of a lot of improvement in the last few weeks and some lower rounds in the mid to high 60s, but obviously nine birdies around this place is a great round and something I was very pleased with.

'I felt very in control. It's been a while since I felt like that. Everything starts for me when I can feel like I can drive it in the fairway and then give myself some opportunities, and obviously when the putter is warm it's always one of my best weapons in the bag.'

Despite losing the lead, Fisher stayed in contention with a round of 70 and now sits two behind Donald - with the same gap back to Frenchman Alexander Levy.

Donald keeps a look out for the baboon before finishing the round ten under par and leading the Challenge 

'I don't feel I played as solidly as yesterday,' Fisher said of his second-round effort.

'I didn't hit it as well off the tee. It would have been nice to have picked up a couple coming in, but six under yesterday and two under today, it's moving in the right direction and I'm only two shots behind with two rounds to go.

'Yesterday we read the greens really well but today we over-read them. I had seven or eight putts that I hit exactly where I wanted to, but I over-read the borrow. Hopefully tomorrow they will go in again.' 

Ross Fisher, teeing off in South Africa, hopes to catch Donald over the weekend from two shots behind
