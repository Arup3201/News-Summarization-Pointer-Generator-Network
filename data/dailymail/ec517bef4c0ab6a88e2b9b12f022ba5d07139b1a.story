The family of a 23-year-old Santa Rosa man who died after he contracted the H1N1 flu virus says his illness wasn't accurately diagnosed until it was too late to possibly save his life.

The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reports Matthew Walker was admitted to a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Santa Rosa on December 27 after he reported breathing difficulties.

The previous day he was sent home from the hospital after being diagnosed with pneumonia.

Walker's family says Kaiser doctors didn't discover Walker had the 'swine flu' until after he was put into a medically induced coma before his death Wednesday.

Walker is one of four people who have died in the most recent outbreak of the H1N1 strain on California's north coast.Â 

The virus first emerged in 2009. In the 2009-2010 flu season, 12,000 people died from the virus - or complications caused by the disease - across the U.S.

The previously healthy 23-year-old's Facebook page provides a devastating timeline of his decline.

On December 22, he posted that he had a sore throat, cough, runny nose, nausea and a headache, plus no food at the Santa Rosa apartment he shared with two roommates.

'The things that make me miss home... Like moms home made chicken noodle soup!' he wrote.

By December 26, Walker wrote that he'd spent a 'miserable' six hours in the emergency room of Kaiser Permanente hospital where he was diagnosed with 'bad' pneumonia on his left lung.

The very last post Walker made was a picture of himself looking wan and tired with the caption, 'Lying on a gurney with 103 temp today. No fun...'

According to the Press Democrat, Walker's sister Ruth Bell said her brother's cough became so violent on December 27 that doctors had to sedate him. He went into cardiac arrest and was put in an induced coma. His brain began to swell.

Walker's sister, Ruth Bell, said Saturday her brother's death is a 'devastating loss' and 'there is some anger.'

Kaiser officials said Saturday they couldn't comment on the case, citing patient confidentiality.
