Former England left-back Ashley Cole is weighing up moves to Barcelona or AC Milan.

Cole, who was released by Chelsea at the end of last season, has offers from both clubs.

Barcelona are struggling to fill the left-back position and relied on Brazilian Adriano towards the end of last season.

On the move: Ashley Cole was released by Chelsea and is considering offers from Barcelona and AC Milan

But it remains a problem position following the sale of Eric Abidal to Monaco last summer and Cole has been targeted by new manager Luis Enrique.

Milan are also on the lookout for new players after Filippo Inzaghi was brought in to replace Clarence Seedorf as the club's new coach.

Many at Chelsea believe Cole, regarded as one of the best left backs of all time, got a raw deal from Jose Mourinho last season.

Offers: At the age off 33, the former England defender believes he has plenty to offer

He got back into the team for the Champions League clash with Atletico Madrid in the Vicente Calderon, but failed to convince Mourinho to keep him.

At the age of 33 Cole still believes he has plenty to offer and had hoped to remain in the Barclays Premier League.

He retired from international football when England head coach opted to take Leighton Baines and Southampton left-back Luke Shaw to the World Cup.
