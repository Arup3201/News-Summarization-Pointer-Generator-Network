A Miami Beach police officer has been reinstated after testing positive for drugs by successfully arguing he unknowingly absorbed the drug through a sex cream he was given by 'an old Cuban guy.'

After detective Reinaldo Casas tested positive for cocaine he was fired from the department, but launched a union grievance days later insisting that the drug had been unwittingly absorbed into his blood through an erection-enhancing cream he applied to his genitals.

His defense worked.

Drug test: Reinaldo Casas claims his positive drug test was due to a sex aid cream that he used because his sexual prowess was failing

An arbitrator this week ordered Casas, 
who was fired last year because of this positive drug test, be 
reinstated with complete back pay.

'There is no evidence in the record to show that (Casas) was aware the cream contained a controlled substance,' according to the arbitrator’s report released Thursday.

By law, Miami Beach police must comply with the ruling. The decision caps an embarrassing saga for Casas, who was a homicide investigator when he was fired in February 2013. Casas had failed a random drug test administered by the police department.

'Having never knowingly used cocaine, I was baffled, perplexed and confused,' Casas wrote in his grievance.

At a grievance hearing, Casas testified that a buddy, Idilio Godinez, gave him the cream 'with the advice that it would help him in his sexual liaisons.'

Godinez testified that he got the sex-enhancement cream from 'an old Cuban guy' as a gift for giving him some political campaign signs. Godinez claimed he did not know what was in the cream, but had tried it himself and it worked.

The substance, which resembled Vaseline, was contained in a series of unmarked purple containers and appeared to be homemade.

The city insisted that Casas’ story was 'incredible'
 and he should have known what he was ingesting his body. The arbitrator
 disagreed and ordered Casas returned to duty with back pay — he earns 
$74,745.84 a year.

Casas
 has had a rocky career with the police force and was reprimanded in the
 past for making ‘conflicting statements’, missing court appearances, 
‘excessive sick-time usage’, and ‘gross negligence’, according to Miami New Times.

He said that he had come to his conclusion that the cream was to blame after ‘heavy deliberation and the insight of others’.

‘The sexual aid cream was provided to me by a friend to assist my sexual performance,’ he stated in the report.

Casas claims he was involved in a rollover crash in 2002 which had ruined 30 per cent of his memory, according to the Times.

When cops looked into his claim that he'd lost 30 per cent of his memory in July 2005, they came up with nothing.

They also found he had lied about whether any allegation against him had ever been sustained while he was employed at the Hialeah Police Department.

His conduct had been ‘highly inappropriate’, a police investigator found, and Casas was suspended for two days.

In 2006, he was cited for ‘gross negligence’ and ‘gross inefficiency’ in a case involving a rental van, which he allowed a tow truck to take away, even though it had more than $1,000 worth of goods inside.

Casas, who was making over $122,000 a year, according to Miami Beach Exposed, claimed ‘there was no property in the van’ when it was towed.

One year later, Casas missed a court appearance saying it was because of a dental appointment, but Miami Beach Police had no record of that purported telephone call, according to internal police records.

It was his second unexcused absence in a year, according to the Times.
