Officials say the number of passengers believed to be sick with the highly contagious norovirus has nearly doubled aboard a cruise ship sailing to ports in California.

Princess Cruises spokeswoman Karen Candy said on Wednesday that 66 passengers and 17 crew members were sick and had to be isolated to their cabins aboard the Crown Princess.

The update, issued Wednesday, shows that the number has doubled from Monday's original count of 37 passengers.

Officials believe norovirus is to blame for the illnesses but they have not confirmed it with tests yet.

The disease is spread person-to-person and can include nausea and diarrhea.

Candy says the ship's staff has disinfected door handles and other surfaces.

The Crown Princess is on a seven-day cruise that includes stops in San Diego and Santa Barbara.

It is scheduled to end in Los Angeles on Saturday but has been stopped in San Francisco as they address the outbreak.

Norovirus is known for spreading rapidly in contained, highly-traffic areas and cruise ships have been highly-susceptible in the past.

More than 120 people caught the disease on board a Holland America cruise ship.

In the month of January alone, the CDC reported that there were in excess of 600 cases of norovirus on cruise ships in the Caribbean.
