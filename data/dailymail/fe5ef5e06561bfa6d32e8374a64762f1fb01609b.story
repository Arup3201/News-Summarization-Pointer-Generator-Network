Floyd Mayweather Jnr has not ruled out facing Manny Pacquiao in boxing's first $100million superfight - but only after the battered Filipino has at least one warm-up bout.

Pacquiao was knocked out cold by the brutal right hand of Juan Manuel Marquez in Las Vegas last Saturday, a result which looked to end hopes of the 33-year-old facing Mayweather.

But the five-weight world champion insists he remains interested in fighting his pound-for-pound rival, if terms can be agreed.

'Pacquiao's focus should on be on 
trying to take a vacation, get his mind right, and get a few tune-up 
fights so he can bounce back,' Mayweather told Fight Hype.

'I feel bad for him. There's a 
difference in the ways you can get knocked out. See, when a guy gets 
knocked out and he can get up, they sit him on his stool, rub his back 
and he goes home to ice himself.

'But when you gotta wake a guy up 
with smelling salts and got a concussion and he gotta go to hospital 
overnight, that's crucial. I mean, that's close to death.

'When I offered Manny Pacquiao $40m, I told him I would wire him $20m up front, just agree to the guaranteed $40m.

'He told me [he wanted] 50/50 and then hopped off the phone.'

Mayweather will return to action on 
May 4 at the MGM Grand, his first bout since serving two months of an 
87-day prison sentence for assaulting his ex-girlfriend.

He also revealed he is considering hiring his father, Floyd Snr, as his trainer after his uncle Roger took ill.

The pair have a fractured relationship and Floyd Jnr ejected his dad from his gym last year before his fight with Victor Ortiz.

'We don't really know what the future
holds for Floyd Mayweather as far as who's gonna be the trainer, but 
I'm leaning towards my father at this particular time,' he added.

'My dad has to realise that I'm an 
adult. I just want my dad to accept and respect me as an adult. I think 
my dad still looks at me as his 10-year-old son.'

Back in action: Mayweather also has a date schemed in his diary to fight in September

Mayweather will also fight on 
September 14 and while no opponents have been announced for either date,
names in the frame include Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Robert Guerrero.

The 35-year-old, who remains 
undefeated after 43 fights, and holds the WBC welterweight and WBA 
(Super) light-middleweight world titles, concluded: 'I don't know who my
team has scouted but whoever it is, it's going to be an exciting show.

'I can't wait. I'm looking to go out there and perform and look well for my fans.'
