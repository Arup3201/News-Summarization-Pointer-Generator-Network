Decline: Britain will have Europe's fifth lowest percentage of people over 65 by 2035, estimates have suggested

A surge in babies born to immigrant parents has moved Britain from having one of Europe's most rapidly ageing populations to one of the youngest, official figures show.

In contrast to the previously high numbers of people over 65 in the UK, an increased birth rate in the past decade has reversed the trend thanks in part to the numbers of immigrant babies.

The figures mean Britain is now predicted to go from having the second highest proportion of retired people to the fifth lowest in Europe, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Estimates show that the number of people aged 65 or over in the UK increased by 1.7m between 1985 and 2010.

In 1985 the UK was second only to Sweden for the number of people aged 65 in its population.

Britain ranks 15th out of the 27 EU countries, according to official estimates.

But
by 2035, forecasts show that the percentage will have climbed at such a
slow rate that Britain will have the fifth lowest number in Europe, 
higher than only Slovakia, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Ireland.

The
Office for National Statistics has forecast that Britain will have 
nearly 17 million people over 65 in its population by 2035, which 
equates to 23 per cent of the predicted population.

By
then it is predicted that Germany will have the highest percentage of 
retired people, with nearly one in three people being over 65.

Experts believe the arrival of immigrant workers, many of whom are at the age where they could start families, is set to significantly change the population statistics in Britain.

Between 2004 and 2010 more than 1.4 million Eastern Europeans came to work in Britain.

It emerged in 2010 that one in four babies born the previous year were born to foreign-born mothers.

In a commentary on the statistics, an ONS spokesperson said: 'Over the period 1990 to 2010, the UK aged less rapidly than the EU-27 average.

1985: Nearly three decades ago Britain was second in the EU only to Sweden for the percentage of retired people in its population

2010: Two years ago around 17 per cent of the UK's population was made up of elderly people

2035: In the next two decades the ageing of Britain's population is set to be reversed, thanks to increased numbers of immigrant babies

'One of the contributing factors for this was the relatively high fertility rate in the UK over the last decade compared with countries in central, southern and Eastern Europe.

'There is a greater proportion of women of child-bearing age within the immigrant section of the population, there is a bulge in terms of the child-bearing age and the optimum working age community.'

Nick Sanderson, chairman of the Association of Retirement Villages, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The latest ONS Focus on Older People report shows that Britain is ageing.

'This rise in life expectancy highlights that many of us could spend 40 years or more in retirement.

'In light of this longevity, the current care model and its focus on institutional care is clearly inappropriate and unwanted.'
