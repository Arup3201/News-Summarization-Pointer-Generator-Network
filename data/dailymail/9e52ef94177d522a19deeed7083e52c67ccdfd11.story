A Polish gang who launched a brutal attack on a top academic walked in through Britain’s open borders despite horrific criminal records.

Professor Paul Kohler, 55, suffered appalling injuries when he was beaten in front of his family at his £2million home.

Images of the battered face of the law expert, a father of four and university friend of Prince Edward, shocked the nation as police mounted an international manhunt.

Now it can be revealed that the four men are all career criminals who saw Britain’s wealthy suburbs as a soft target. Their burly ringleader was on the run from a Polish prison and had already served three sentences for a gun attack, theft, burglary and drugs offences.

Celebration: Paul Kohler with his family. They were playing a board game when the raiders burst into their £2m home. Inset: His face after the attack

Academic Paul Kohler (pictured left after the attack and right today), 55, needed facial reconstruction surgery for a fractured eye socket after he was set upon by a gang of balaclava-clad men

He and all three accomplices have a string of convictions in their homeland, including similar violent robberies.

The revelations will increase the pressure on ministers to regain control of the borders and carry out proper checks on violent EU nationals coming to Britain. They follow the row over the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross by Latvian Arnis Zalkalns, whom police discovered was a convicted killer.

Yesterday, Prof Kohler sat silently with his wife Samantha MacArthur at Kingston Crown Court as the four men pleaded guilty.

The head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London still bears the scars of the attack. He was badly beaten when the masked gang burst into his three-storey Edwardian home in Wimbledon, South West London, on August 11 while his family were playing a board game.

They pinned him to the floor and threatened to smash a heavy wooden cabinet over his head while screaming: ‘Where’s the money?’

Gang members: Pawel Honc, 23, and Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, were arrested by police at the scene of the attack and today admitted aggravated burglary and causing grievous bodily harm with intent

Co-accused: Oskar Pawlowicz, 29, of Mitcham, and Dawid Tychon, 29, of no fixed abode, also admitted aggravated burglary, but charges of GBH were dropped against the pair after they pleaded not guilty

His wife was also threatened by two of the intruders, who tried to tie her to a chair with duct tape. The terrified couple were saved by one of their four daughters, Eloise, 24, who barricaded herself in her room and dialled 999.

Officers arrived within seconds and arrested Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, and Pawel Honc, 23, who were both covered in blood.

Ringleader Dawid Tychon, 29, was arrested six days later driving a suspected stolen car – while wearing an England football shirt – and later linked to the robbery by his mobile phone.

He was caught with a bewildering array of drugs, including cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines and other stimulants. Police also found a potentially deadly gas-powered flame thrower in the boot of his car.

The fourth man, Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, was captured a month later when police traced him to a property in Leominster, Herefordshire.

Police quickly discovered that the men were all career criminals who used their size and strength to overpower victims. None of the four, who all practised bodybuilding and martial arts, knew each other in Poland but they became friends through a heavy-drinking clique.

Victims: Mr Kohler’s wife, Samantha MacArthur (left), was also threatened by two of the intruders who tried to tie her to a chair with duct tape during the break-in on August 11

Panic: As Mr Kohler was attacked, he called out to Ms MacArthur asking her to ring the police, a move he said he instantly regretted because it alerted the burglars to her whereabouts

Tychon fled his homeland in 2012 while on the run from prison where he was serving a long sentence for theft and burglary.

His right hand man was football hooligan Tomaszewski, who came to Britain in 2013 after being released from an eight-year jail sentence. Labelled a ‘very dangerous person’ on police files, he is a dedicated follower of the Cracovia football club in Krakow, his hometown.

Police suspect he was a member of a criminal gang associated with the club and is responsible for badly beating other men during street brawls. Shaven-headed Pawlowichz was caught on CCTV fleeing Prof Kohler’s home and went on the run.

The thug, from Tarnow in south-east Poland, has served two jail sentences in his homeland for violent assaults.

Their guilty pleas come just weeks after a devastating report revealed the £1billion-a-year failure by successive governments to police Britain’s borders. Foreign offenders are able to walk into the country unchecked, commit new offences – then avoid deportation on human rights grounds once their jail terms are complete, spending watchdog the National Audit Office found.

It said 1,400 foreign criminals are living here who should have been turned away at the border. Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said yesterday: ‘This is yet another one of the very many reasons why we need to control our borders, stop the free movement and only let in people we want.’

Notorious: Career criminal Dawid Tychon

Each gang member was let into the UK despite a long criminal record. Here, we reveal the shocking scale of their offending.

The Bodybuilder

Dawid Tychon is a violent career criminal who masterminded the raid but tried to persuade police he was only the getaway driver.

Wanted by the Polish prison authorities and at least two forces, the 29-year-old is a violent gangster linked to robberies, drugs and car crime.

He has already served three jail sentences in his native country for an attack involving a gun, theft, burglary and drugs offences.

Tychon, an unemployed labourer, revelled in his notoriety, flexing his muscles and wearing hooded tops for photographs he posted online.

The soccer thug

Die-hard football hooligan Mariusz Tomaszewski fled Poland where police files described him as a ‘very dangerous man’.

He served eight years in prison for violent offences and arrived in Britain in 2013 to continue his life of crime while living with his pregnant girlfriend.

Tomaszewski lost a job at Heathrow Airport after oversleeping on the first day and instead spent his days drinking and smoking cannabis.

His ex-wife, who divorced him in 2003 and has started a new life in Austria with their teenage son, said she was horrified at what he has done.

‘I knew that he was only recently let out of jail in Poland so for him to be back inside again so soon is crazy,’ she said.

The Henchmen

The final gang members Oskar Pawlowichz, 29, and Pawel Honc, 23, both have lengthy criminal records, police said. Pawlowichz, 29, who was caught on CCTV fleeing the robbery, has served two jail sentences in his native country for violent assaults.

A brunette, who appears to be his estranged wife Eliza, posted a series of messages online after his arrest, including a social media ‘status update’ that read ‘DEAD!!’

Apparently referring to his crime, she added: ‘When a person dies there remains after him on this earth nothing but the good which he did to others.’

Speaking after the guilty pleas, Prof Kohler – whose view of the defendants was blocked by frosted glass – said the motive behind the attack remains a ‘complete mystery’.

One theory police investigated was that the gang were looking for takings from the family’s tiny cabaret bar, the Cellar Door, on The Strand in Central London.

But Prof Kohler remains convinced it is a simple case of mistaken identity and said police could find nothing linking the gang to him. He said he is recovering well, despite problems with his left eye, but said his wife and children remain ‘quite traumatised by it all’.

‘They pleaded guilty because the evidence against them was overwhelming. But I still want to look in their eyes and see their faces,’ he added.

Asked whether his part ownership of the bar could be behind the robbery, Prof Kohler said: ‘There was no money, I have never got anything for God’s sake. They just didn’t believe it. Academics do not attract enemies – well, we do but they are not those who would employ violent thugs.’

Family: Mr Kohler with his daughters Saskia and Tamara. His other daughter Eloise was in the house at the time of the attack and called police to the scene

Honc, of no fixed abode, and Tomaszewski, from Mitcham, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent and aggravated burglary. Pawlowichz, of Mitcham, and Tychon, of no fixed abode, both admitted a single charge of aggravated burglary.

Barristers for all four men said they wanted to express their ‘sincere regret and apologies’. Judge Susan Tapping remanded them in custody and warned them that they can expect to receive substantial prison terms. They will be sentenced on January 29.

Detective Inspector Dan O’Sullivan, who led the inquiry, said: ‘This was an cowardly and vicious attack on an innocent family.’

Aftermath: Mr Kohler said he was ‘unrecognisable’ with swelling on the side of his head the size of a football, and blood flowing from his mouth and eyes
