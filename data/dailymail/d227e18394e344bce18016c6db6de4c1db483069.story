The Australian government has rallied behind a plan to protect the Great Barrier Reef from future degradation, releasing a long-term plan to prevent the World Heritage Site from being declared 'in danger'. 

The World Heritage Committee is to decide whether the Reef is on the 'in danger' list in June, and in a bid to ensure the long-term health of the national treasure, the Federal and Queensland governments released The Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan.

The Reef, which covers an area of 348,000 square metres, is the world’s most extensive coral reef ecosystem, and is listed by UNESCO 'a site of remarkable variety and beauty'.

The Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan was announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Saturday

Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed the plan on Hamilton Island in far north Queensland on Saturday, and said that Australia is 'utterly committed as an entire nation to the protection of the Great Barrier Reef which is one of the natural wonders of the world', reported The ABC.

'The Great Barrier Reef is an incredibly diverse and rich environment – a maze of 3000 coral reefs and 1050 islands stretching for over 2300 kilometres,' said a press release from Mr Abbott. 

'It is already regarded as being among the best managed marine parks in the world. We’re determined to keep it that way.'

The Reef includes 2,500 individual reefs and over 900 islands, as well as over 1,500 species of fish, about 400 species of coral, 4,000 species of mollusk, and 240 species of birds.

'Collectively these landscapes and seascapes provide some of the most spectacular maritime scenery in the world,' says the Reef's listing by UNESCO.

'This diversity, especially the endemic species, means the GBR is of enormous scientific and intrinsic importance, and it also contains a significant number of threatened species.'

The Reef can be seen from outer space, and includes popular tourist destinations such as the Whitsundays and Princess Charlotte Bay.

The plan includes a ban on dumping dredge spoil anywhere in the world heritage area, a limit on port expansion to four sites and targets for reducing sediment, nutrient and pesticide contamination. 

The plan identifies climate change as one of the major threats, and aims to improve water quality. 

Queensland Environment Minister Steven Miles said run-off of sediment, nutrients and pesticides was the biggest medium term threat to the reef, which the plan addressed. 

'With it, we will be able to convince the World Heritage Committee that not only should they not list the reef as in-danger but that we will actually keep the reef from being in danger,' he said. 

Greenpeace labelled the plan weak, as it still allows for massive coal port expansion and did not address climate change to a deserved extent, despite the report declaring this the main threat facing the Reef. 

The Commonwealth Government has committed a further $100 million for the Reef Trust, in addition to the $40 million provided by the Coalition last year.

'Australians are rightfully proud of the Great Barrier Reef and recognise its immense biological, economic and cultural value,' said the statement.

'Together, we are committed to protecting it for future generations.'

The Federal Minister for the Environment Greg Hunt released a statement with Mr Abbott highlighted that the continued increase in water quality was a focus of the plan.

'The work that’s being undertaken to improve water quality builds on the Commonwealth Government’s total and permanent ban on the dumping of capital dredge spoil in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,' the statement said.

'The heart of this plan is about better quality, with hard targets including a 50 per cent reduction in nitrogen by 2018 and an 80 per cent reduction by 2025,' Mr Hunt said at the release of the plan.
