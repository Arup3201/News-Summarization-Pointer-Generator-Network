The Duchess of Cornwall visited the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show today.

Wearing a floral print blue and white dress, she looked regal and summery all at once as she toured the 
showground.

Camilla, 65, viewed RHS award-winning gardens and presented the winner of 
the RHS Young School Gardener of the Year competition with their award.

She stopped off at the QEF (Queen Elizabeth Foundation) Garden for Joy, which won Silver this year, at midday. 

The rest of her schedule included the Rose and Floristry Vintage Festival marquee, the 
Growing Tastes marquee, the RHS Butterfly Dome and Bees, the Floral 
Marquee and Scarecrow competition displays.

The
 therapeutic garden is the first 
of its kind having been created especially for wheelchair users by a 
team of  young disabled people and designers. 

All sixteen runners up will be at the Macmillan Cancer Support Legacy Garden to meet The Duchess of Cornwall.

QEF is a national charity working with 
children and adults with physical and learning disabilities, or acquired
 brain injuries - supporting them in gaining new skills and increased 
independence.

The
 RHS Young School Gardener of the Year is an annual competition, aimed 
at children up to the age of 16, which is open to all schools in the RHS
 Campaign for School Gardening scheme, of which there are nearly 17,000.

The QEF Garden For Joy was designed specifically with the needs of wheelchair users in mind as they will have an unhindered view from their own pathway across the front of the garden. It has raised beds to plant in as well as unhindered views from the pathway across the front of the garden - a first for the show.

The Garden was created by award winning designers Heather Appleton and Bella D’Arcy Reed. 

After the show it will be rebuilt back at Dorincourt, QEF Independent Living Services’ 37 bed centre for disabled young people, nearly all of whom are wheelchair users.

Jonathan Powell, Chief Executive of QEF, said: 'The QEF Garden for Joy has been designed to celebrate the life-changing work and support our charity gives to over 4,000 disabled children and adults every year.  We are delighted to welcome the Duchess of Cornwall to our garden and show her the amazing achievements of people living with disabilities.'
