Are you a Geordie girl with a penchant for clutch bags or a Londoner toting a gargantuan piece of designer arm candy?

If so, you're inadvertently telling people where you come from, according to a new study which revealed that your choice of bag corresponds with your postcode.

According to the research, more than 60 per cent of northern fashion followers 'glam it up' throughout the day and into the evening, while for southerners, bigger is always better.

Southerners such as Victoria Beckham prefer big bags while Cheryl Cole inspired northerners prefer clutches

Three out of four London ladies choose oversized tote bags, perhaps inspired by the likes of style guru Victoria Beckham, who is regularly pictured with Hermes Birkins and Louis Vuitton over-sized Speedys.

Debenhams, which conducted the research, put the trend down to women who live in London working longer hours, many without access to a car therefore needing an extra-large handbag.

Natelle Baddeley, head of accessories at Debenhams, said: 'We are noticing a new trend among Londoners known as the "24 hour" handbag.

'Size is everything so it's the bigger the better. Northerners are all about the sexy clutch bag, channelling their inner Cheryl Cole and packing all their essentials into a small bag that can take them from desk to dance floor.'

Meanwhile women in the Midlands are more practical with 72 per cent of them investing in a long lasting, mid-sized handbag that works for every occasion - much like local girl Cat Deeley.

Practical: Scottish women love a stylish satchel while their Cambrian cousins prefer a sporty rucksack

Safety-savvy Scots opt for a crossbody bag - a female version of the wallet chain - which allows them to carry no more than a credit card and a lip gloss.

Women in Ireland have been buying 'fuss free shoulder bags' which are perfect for busy first-time mums such as The Saturdays singer Una Healy.

Debenhams say the shoulder bag is a more compact version of the '24 hour Londoners' choice, acting as a bottomless pit stashed full of almost every essential.

Welsh women cut the fittest figures with two-thirds (68 per cent) leaning towards sport bags and backpacks like marathon loving local Katherine Jenkins.

Professor Karen Pine, of the University of Hertfordshire, said: 'In recent times the handbag seems to have become the ultimate statement piece for women.

'Ladies are signalling their status, and many do that via the handbag they choose. This research also demonstrates how the bag we carry, like the clothes we wear, reflects our personality.

'The handbag has become an integral part of a woman's wardrobe and a significant part of her identity.

'The contents of her bag are highly personal and the style of bag is a shorthand way of saying, "This is who I am", whether that's career woman, sporty or practical type.'
