From the steaming natural vents of Yellowstone National Park to the concrete streets of Portland, Biddy has attracted nearly 400,000 followers to his Instagram account with pictures of his travels.

That might be because Biddy is not a person, but actually an adorable hedgehog whose owners Toni DeWeese and Tom Unterseher, from Oregon, take him with them wherever they go.

Since he began posting on April 29 last year, Biddy has watched waves roll in off the Pacific Ocean from Cape Kiwanda, explored the Columbia River Gorge which separates Oregon from its neighbouring state of Washington, and visited Devils Tower in Wyoming.

He has also celebrated the Mexican festival of Cinco del Mayo with a sombrero and a poncho, and marked father's day with a visit to a donut shop.

While Biddy does most of his adventuring solo, he is sometimes joined by his sister, Charlie, who is a Welsh corgi, Chihuahua, Papillion and Beagle cross. Here the pair adventure in Mount Hood National Park

Lazy days: Biddy relaxes while on the way home from one of his adventures (left) then enjoys a day on the couch watching the Seattle Seahawks play the San Fransisco 49ers

While Biddy's fur and spines make him a hardy creature, sometimes when the weather is particularly cold he is forced to stay at home, like this winter's day by Crater Lake, Oregon

However, once the weather had warmed back up, Biddy was more than happy to accompany his owners for a stroll around the National Park
