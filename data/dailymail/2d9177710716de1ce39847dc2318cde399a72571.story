A love-sick Turkish stowaway froze to death after sneaking on board a passenger jet to fly to the UK to see his girlfriend. 

Hikmet Komur was exposed to temperatures as low as -60C after climbing into the landing gear bay of a British Airways jet before it left Istanbul in July, 2013. 

The 32-year-old could not afford to pay for the fare to see his girlfriend, Luisa de Silva, who lives in the west London, an inquest into his death has heard. 

Turkish Hikmet Komur died after stowing himself in the undercarriage of a British Airways flight to Heathrow so that he could be with his girlfriend, Luisa de Silva (pictured together above)

Mr Komur's lifeless body was found by British Airways staff at Heathrow Airport after the four hour flight. 

West London Coroner's Court heard how the divorced father suffered fatal brain damage after being exposed to subzero temperatures in the air.

Just two months before his death, Ms de Silva, whom he had known 'for many years', visited the man in Turkey. 

He begged her to move to Istanbul to be with him, but she refused. 

'Once he said he had no money, so I was sending money, £50 or £60,' a distressed Ms de Silva told the inquest. 

'He said he was going to get a visa and come here. Then he sent me a picture of his passport. I knew it was not real.'

Shortly before making the journey, Mr Komur is understood to have emailed the woman to tell him he loved her.  

Weeping, Ms de Silva, who lives in west London, added: 'I tried to stop him but I couldn't do anything.'

The divorced father told Ms de Silva he would travel to the UK after obtaining a passport in the weeks before his death

A British Airways statement revealed Mr Komur was discovered when a manager saw 'what he believed to be a human foot and some cloth hanging out of the landing gear cover'. 

Inside the compartment they found Mr Komur, who had been wearing a woolen hat and with white socks over his hands. 

Ms de Silva told the inquest she tried to stop him from visiting the UK

Later, aviation security advisor Nick Gould said: 'It’s believed that he intended to visit his girlfriend into the UK.'

Kazim Komur, Mr Komur's brother who lives in London, said he had not seen him for more than 15 years when he was given news of his death. 

'He had some family problems with his mother, with his siblings. 

'My brother was an adventurer.' 

Recording an accidental death, Coroner Jeremy Chipperfield said: 'It's clear that Hikmet Komur in the past demonstrated an intention to work, to come to the UK, to be with his friend Luisa de Silva, who was a close friend and with whom he wanted to continue some kind of relationship.

'It’s very likely that he intended to come to the UK by stowing himself in an undercarriage of BA675 from Istanbul.

'It’s unclear how he got into that wheel bay but the evidences strongly suggests that it was voluntary. My conclusion is that this was an accidental death.'

He added that the medical cause of death was cerebral hypoxia, where the brain becomes severely damaged due lack of oxygen.

Addressing the victim’s brother, Mr Chipperfield added: 'Mr Komur, I’m very very sorry for your loss. 

'It must be distressing and difficult to come to court and listen to these things.'
