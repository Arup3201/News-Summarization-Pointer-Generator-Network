Poundland founder Steve Smith has slashed £750,000 off the asking price of his sprawling country home in a bid to sell the 15,000 sq ft luxury property.

Mr Smith's house, located in Bridgnorth, Shrophshire, is a seven-bedroom mansion featuring five grand reception rooms, a dance floor, bar and swimming pool.

The home has been for sale on and off since 2011 with an initial asking price of £6.5million, but in its online sale listing he has now cut it down to £5.75m.

He bought the property a decade ago for £2.2million, but recently said with only one child left at home, he and his wife Tracey hope to downsize.

Only 16-year-old Joe still lives at home, while Katie, 26, lives with her husband and two children in a converted barn on the 28-acre estate. 

He said: 'The house is very special to us and it will be a real wrench for us to leave. We began refurbishing the home in 2000 and finally finished it in 2007.

'It was a real labour of love and no expense was spared. I especially love our home pub with a fully stocked bar. It’s really unique and we’ve had some great parties there.'

When he bought Hammer Hill House in 2004, Mr Smith set about doubling the property in size, turning the quaint country house into a sprawling estate.

The property listing boasts of the space afforded by the 28-acre estate  Country Life magazine once mooted as a possible base for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Mr Smith added: 'We've had the place for 11 - 12 years and I suppose I like projects, I get itchy feet and want to build something else.

'I'm looking for a site where I can create my own house and build the kids' houses. So I'm looking for a plot of land where I can build four houses and keep the family together.

'We've reduced the price because at that level the stamp duty is pretty high, so at that price I've more or less knocked the stamp duty off it.'

Advertised on his own website estatesdirect.com, the listing reads: 'The house is approached through magnificent wrought iron electric gates opening to a sweeping tree lined driveway to the turning circle to the front of the house and into the walled coach yard to one side.

'The gardens and grounds are beautifully landscaped and maintained with sweeping lawns, glasshouses, stocked borders and hidden pathways through wooded vistas.

'The house has extensive grazing land with four paddocks partially surrounded by mature woodland.'

Mr Smith founded the cut-price discount store Poundland in 1990 before selling it a decade later for £50million.

Earlier this week the budget chain made headlines when the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that it must drop its claim that everything costs £1 because it sells CDs and DVDs for £2.

It was a major blow for the company which has built an empire on the boast that just £1 can buy anything in its stores.

The decision even calls into question whether the budget chain can legitimately continue to call itself ‘Poundland’.

Before the advertising watchdog’s ruling, Poundland's website boasted: ‘Everything for £1 was the idea of our founders in 1990 and we’re still true to that vision today.’

Under a heading ‘Our Values’, it added: ‘We’ve grown to be the largest single price value retailer in the UK...We are very proud to offer you a single £1 price, that hasn’t changed since we opened our first store.’

However, people complained to the ASA that these claims were no longer accurate because it was stocking DVDs of blockbuster films in a concession partnership with another firm for £2 each.

Poundland defended the breaking of its normal £1 price barrier saying the £2 items were part of a special promotion run at the tills and sold to customers providing they met a minimum spending threshold.
