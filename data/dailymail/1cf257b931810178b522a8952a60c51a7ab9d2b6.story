These heartwarming pictures show two playful cubs putting their best paws forward for a spot of lion dancing.

Swiping their claws before pouncing forward, the duo move around their 'dancefloor' with a sort of hap-hazard grace at the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania.

At one point the pair stand up on their back legs and touch paws - almost as though they're about to start a ballroom dance.

Strictly cub dancing: Two playful lions dance together, swiping their paws and pouncing forward in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania

Moves: One of the cubs stands on his back legs while the other watches on slightly cautiously

Roar routine? One cub stands while the other reaches up to place its paws on its partners - perhaps getting ready to ballroom dance

Then one of the dancers takes a run up - much to the apparent alarm of its partner who watches on with a look of dread in his eyes.

Perhaps the pair were attempting to try out a lift, as performed by professional dancers. Unfortunately there is no photographic evidence as to how it turned out...

Later on, however, it would seem that one of the dancing duo has overdone it and so takes a little rest, lying on its back with its legs stretched up in the air.

Meanwhile its partner waits on patiently - eager for its next spin on the dancefloor.

Paw performance: One of the cubs looks terrified as its partner takes a run-up. Perhaps the duo were about to try out a gymnastic lift

Taking a break? Clearly exhausted by the arduous routine, one of the cubs takes a little rest while its partner, still eager to continue, waits patiently

Perfect partners: The images were taken by wildlife photographer Win van den Heever, 41, who spent two weeks waiting for the shots of the cubs

The beautiful photographs were captured 
by professional wildlife photographer Win van den Heever, 41, from South
Africa, who spent two weeks in Ndutu, Tanzania, waiting for the perfect
shots of the cubs.

Mr van den Heever said: 'I was there to photograph the annual wildebeest calving season.

'The rains were late this year and the wildebeest were still in Serengeti waiting for the rains to arrive.

'The animals in the area were all quite desperate for the first rains to fall and the daily dust storms would choke the air.

Shall we dance? Meanwhile, two older female lions practise their routine in Greater Kruger National Park, South Africa

And hold! One of the dancing queens has a look of concentration on its face during this particularly tricky move

'I took these pictures just as the 
rain started to fall and almost instantaneously these older lion cubs 
started to play with each.'

Elsewhere, it would seem that two older lions have also been struck with a bit of boogie fever.

But rather than a hap-hazard dance routine - these two pros have got their moves down to an art.

The pair sway and hold a variety of poses in a far more elegant ensemble than the younger performers.

The females, pictured at Greater Kruger National Park, South Africa, first stand up on their hind legs - a move the cubs could only briefly master.

Then they stand paw-to-paw, looking into each others eyes, and embrace.

Professionals: Rather than the cub's rather less elegant routine, these female lions seem to have dancing down to an art - embracing and swaying together

The judges wouldn't like that! At one point the pair seem to mess up their dance, with one of the partners slipping from the embrace

Finally, they sway from side to side in a routine that would give any Strictly Come Dancing contestant a run for their money.

However, at one point disaster strikes and one of the females slips.

The mistake obviously causes a rift between the pair - as one paces away from the dancefloor, with the other following closely behind.

But the fight doesn't last long as the females are soon back together practising another routine.

Diva disaster: Perhaps upset by her partner's sloppy performance, one of the lion paces away from the dancefloor - hotly pursued by its partner

Kiss and make up: The rift doesn't last for long, however, with the partners soon embracing once again
