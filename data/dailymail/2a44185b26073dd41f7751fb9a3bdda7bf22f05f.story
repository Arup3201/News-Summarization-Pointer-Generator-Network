Older versions of Apple products - including the iPhone 4 and the iPad and iPad 2 3G models - have been banned in the U.S. after an official ruling claimed the devices breach Samsung patents.

The devices are assembled in China and because the ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington bans imports of affected Apple products into America, these devices could be removed from the shelves as early as August.

Apple has been given 60 days to stop selling the products but is appealing the decision, which ruled that Apple copied Samsung's 3G technology in its devices.

Banned: The iPhone 4, seen here on the right, along with the older model, the 3GS on the left, cannot be imported to the U.S. anymore, a trade panel ruled Tuesday

Apple initially sued Samsung in April 2011 for infringing seven utility patents, three design patents, three registered trade dresses and six trademarked icons with its Galaxy line of products, including the Galaxy S smartphone and the Galaxy Tab tablet.

Samsung responded later that month by suing Apple for infringing five patents in South Korea, two in Japan and three in Germany.

The companies have then continued to sue and countersue each other since.

This latest ruling from the US Trade Commission on Tuesday actually overturned a previous ruling in the same case which claimed Apple hadn't breached patents. 

The new ruling followed an appeal by Samsung and is considered a 'final' ruling, although Apple can appeal and President Obama could overturn it.

In a separate patent dispute in US federal court last year, Samsung was ordered to pay £652m ($1bn) for patent infringement, an award that was later slashed to £390m ($598.9m).

Samsung then won a patent dispute on the Galaxy Tab against Apple in the UK in October.

Judge Colin Birss stated that Samsung's tablets were 'not as cool' as the Apple's, and 'do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design.'

All import bans also have to be validated by President Obama and he has 60 days to invalidate the order.

The U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington issued the final ruling on Tuesday in one Samsung's suits against Apple.

The panel issued a limited import ban and
a cease-and-desist order for AT&T models of the iPhone 4, iPhone 
3GS, iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G.

The versions targeted are more than a year 
old but are still solid sellers, Reuters reported.

Samsung and Apple are engaged in a global legal battle over their smartphones, with Apple arguing that Samsung and its Android phones copy vital features of the iPhone.

Samsung is fighting back with its own complaints.

The iPhone 4 was launched in 2010 and is the oldest iPhone still being made.

It's the second bad court ruling for Apple in as many weeks.

A preliminary class settlement which agrees to pay $53 million in refunds to iPhone and iPod Touch customers for voiding their warranties was filed on Tuesday by Apple Inc in the District Court of Northern California in San Francisco.

The settlement would refund up to $200 to each customer who was denied repairs or replacement under warranty of their iPhone or iPod because a small red strip located on the outside of the device indicated that they had been in contact with water.

Not for sale: The ruling also states the iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G cannot be imported as well because they violate a patent held by Samsung

Jeffrey Fazio, an attorney representing two of the four representatives of the class action, told ABC News that Apple refused to honor standard warranties and AppleCare Protection Plans if a white indicator strip near the headphone or charging jacks had turned pink or red.

But 3M,the company that makes the strip (called 'Liquid Submersion Indicators') said humidity alone could have caused the color of strips to turn pink or even red.

This meant that a customer who took an iPhone or iPad for repair would have their warranty voided if the liquid indicator strip was red - even if it had never been in contact with water.
