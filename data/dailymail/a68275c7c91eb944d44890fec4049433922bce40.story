Paul Scholes believes Manchester City can get past Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League if their key players perform.

But the Manchester United legend isn't backing City as one of his teams who could win the competition, claiming that Chelsea are the most likely of the English clubs to taste glory.

And Scholes has picked Juventus as his surprise package to win the competition as a whole.

Manchester City can beat Barcelona next week according to Scholes, if the likes of Sergio Aguero perform

The Spanish side were in excellent form this weekend, with Lionel Messi scoring a hat-trick

Chelsea are the English team with the best chance of success says Scholes ahead of the last 16 games

'I think City can beat them (Barcelona),' Scholes told ITV's Champions League coverage. 'But big players like Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero need to perform and they need to defend well.'

'I think all three English teams will progress but City have the most difficult task.'

'Real Madrid are still the team to beat, even though their form has dipped recently, with Juventus and Chelsea the main threats to them,' added Scholes.

'It will be difficult to look past the likes of Kroos and Ronaldo for Real, and I think Fabregas has become a key man for Chelsea, Pirlo for Juventus and Robben for Bayern.' 

Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba will be crucial if Juventus are to progress in Europe

Scholes is backing Juventus as the team to cause an upset in this year's competition

Scholes picked Juventus' duel with Borussia Dortmund as one of the most exciting ties of the last 16, and pinpointed the Old Lady as dark horses.

'I think Juventus can beat Dortmund,' he said. 'Even though Dortmund are struggling in the league they have performed very well in Champions League, but I think Juve will be too strong with the quality of Pirlo, Paul Pogba and Carlos Tevez.

'I can see them posing a real threat to the teams who most would expect to win this year. They have experience in Pirlo and enough quality to be dangerous on their day.'
