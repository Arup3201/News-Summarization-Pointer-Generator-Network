As far as armed robbers go, James Allan will not be remembered as a criminal mastermind.

In what can only be described as a farcical raid on a corner shop, he failed to ensure he had a foolproof disguise and a meticulously planned gateway.

For starters, he brandished a toy gun.

Then, the dopey 28-year-old unveiled his disguise by whipping off his balaclava in full view of the shop's CCTV camera.

And that was before things went from bad to worse, as he struggled to exit via the one- way door.

Scroll down to watch the CCTV!

He may as well have not worn the balaclava: Not long after this scene is filmed Allan takes it off in full view of CCTV

Not only did staff know him as a regular customer, he had also robbed the place just 10 days earlier.

Allan's embarrassing catalogue of errors started shortly after he burst into Martin's newsagent in Abingdon, Oxon, waving the plastic gun.

Amazingly, in the pantomime-style raid, he did manage to grab £134.98 from the till.

As he attempted to leave the shop, Allan, who was pushing instead of pulling the door, then attempted to kick out the glass panel but toppled backwards into a drinks display, sending bottles skidding across the floor.

Baffled store manager Angela Croke, keen to see the back of him, even went to his aid and helped him leave the store on March 2 this year.

Allan was picked up by police just three hours after his botched robbery, still on the same street and with his balaclava stuffed in his pocket.

When bundled into the police car he burst into tears and said to officers, 'I'm sorry, it's not fair on them - are they all right?'

Allan was jailed for three years for this offence last month but new details can only now be released after he was sentenced at Oxford Crown Court for the earlier raid on the same shop.

The first robbery took place just before 6pm on February 23, when supervisor Leanne Coe Coxon was preparing to close the store.

This time wearing a balaclava for the entirety of the robbery, Allan repeatedly shouted 'Give me the money' while holding an object in a green case as if it were a gun, the judge heard.

Allan forced her to hand over £360 pounds.

David Rhodes, defending, said his client was a hard-working dental nurse until three years ago when his fiancee left him and he turned to Class A drugs.

Judge Gordon Risius did not extend Allan's existing three-year sentence.

Last night Detective Chief Inspector Mark Johns said: 'Clearly Allan's actions show that he isn't cut out for a career in crime, due to the way in which he was apprehended.

'He now has time to think about these actions while serving his sentence in prison.'
