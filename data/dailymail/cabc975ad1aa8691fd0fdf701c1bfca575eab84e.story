The parents of Reeva Steenkamp will not pursue a civil claim against Oscar Pistorius for killing their daughter and will pay back around £6,300 that the athlete gave them in monthly instalments to help with living expenses.

Lawyer Dup de Bruyn said in a statement on Wednesday he had also advised Barry and June Steenkamp to remain 'neutral' with regard to Pistorius' sentence for negligently killing Reeva Steenkamp.

Relatives of victims sometimes testify to their suffering in sentencing hearings, but de Bruyn suggested Steenkamp's parents would not. However, de Bruyn said the parents were 'quite surprised' that Pistorius' lawyers had raised the issue of payments when the athlete had asked the Steenkamps that they be kept confidential.

Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide Pistorius' punishment after finding him guilty last month of culpable homicide. She has wide latitude with the sentence and could send the double-amputee Olympic runner to prison for as many as 15 years, or order a fine and a suspended sentence. House arrest is also an option, and has been suggested by two social workers during this week's hearing. 

Pistorius shot Steenkamp multiple times in his home on February 14, 2013 and was convicted of acting negligently in her death   but acquitted of murder.

De Bruyn released the statement on behalf of the Steenkamps ahead of the third day of the sentencing hearing on Wednesday, saying they had accepted monthly payments of £345 ($550) from Pistorius from March 2013 until last month.

'After Miss Steenkamp (the deceased) was killed... the parents were in financial difficulties,' the statement said.

'We were contacted soon afterwards by Mr Pistorius' lawyers with an offer that Mr Pistorius would contribute an amount... towards the parents' rental and living expenses.'

Revelations over payments to the Steenkamps by Pistorius were made in court on Tuesday, when the chief prosecutor said the Steenkamps had refused a separate offer of £21,000 from Pistorius - considering it 'blood money.'

'When the parents were made aware of this offer, they considered it carefully but decided, for various reasons, that they did not want any payment from Mr Pistorius,' the statement continued. 'This is also why we were instructed to advise that no civil claim would be instituted.'

De Bruyn said he had approached Pistorius' legal team over a possible civil settlement. Pistorius apparently then made the £21,000 offer after selling what he said was his last asset, a car. The parents considered it and turned it down.

The world-famous athlete has had to sell many of his assets, including the house where he killed Steenkamp, to pay his high-powered defence team during a lengthy murder trial.

Meanwhile, Steenkamp's cousin broke down in court on Wednesday as she recalled the moment she heard the model had been shot dead by Pistorius.

In heart-wrenching testimony, Kim Martin said she heard on the radio that the athlete had shot his girlfriend, but desperately hoped it wasn't her.

She told the court: 'I jumped up in my seat and froze. I remember saying, "I hope to God he's cheating".'

She said the shooting had 'ruined our whole family'.

'We were all like, "why, why, why Reeva?",' she told the court. 'It was the worst worst experience I have ever been through'.

As she broke down in tears, prompting the judge to briefly adjourn her evidence, her husband, Dion, rushed to her side.

In the dock, Pistorius buried his head in his hands and sobbed quietly.

The green bucket, into which he frequently wretched during his trial, has remained at his side, but not been needed since he gave evidence in the witness box.

Mr Steenkamp took deep breaths and blinked back tears as his wife June, 67, retained her composure, occasionally shaking her head and glancing at her daughter’s killer to see how he was reacting to the moving testimony. 

In front of the Steenkamps, Samantha Taylor, Pistorius's ex-girlfriend, cautiously wiped tears from beneath her eyes with the corner of a tissue, her mother Trish - rumoured to be one of the next witnesses to be called - had tears streaming down her face.

Behind Pistorius, his sister Aimee also succumbed to tears and his uncle, Arnold, appeared visibly shaken by the dramatic testimony the court was hearing.

Earlier, the prosecutor warned that Pistorius could be at risk of vigilante attacks if he is not sent to prison.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel denounced as 'shockingly inappropriate' the recommendation by two social workers that the athlete be made to carry out community service for killing his girlfriend.

He told the court incredulously: 'If the court sentence is too light and society loses trust in the court, they will take the law into their own hands. That's what the court has to guard against.'

He also hammered defence witness and probation officer Annette Vergeer on her apparent slap-dash report on the state of South Africa's prisons.

Vergeer had warned that the 27-year-old double amputee Paralympian could be gang-raped if sent to jail over the shooting on Valentine's Day last year.

But Mr Nel criticised her use of nine-year-old data and being unfamiliar with the correction services act that outlines care for disabled people.

It came as the families of Pistorius and Steenkamp staged a dramatic reconciliation in court just as details of the secret payments by the killer athlete threatened to inject fresh bitterness between the two camps.

A war of words erupted after the shock revelation that Pistorius had offered £21,000 in 'blood money' and monthly payments totalling £6,300 to the model's parents.

But grieving father Mr Steenkamp was pulled into a hug by the runner's uncle, Arnold, during a private meeting in court.

They were joined by the lawyer for the Steenkamps, prompting speculation that both sides were keen to draw a line under the payment controversy once and for all.

Mr Steenkamp, 69, who suffered a stroke as a result of his grief at the sudden loss of his daughter, was the first to leave court, followed by Mr Pistorius, who is the head of the killer athlete's large family, when the court adjourned for a tea break.

The two men first shook hands before Mr Pistorius reached out his hand to draw Mr Steenkamp into a hug, a wide smile on his face.

Miss Steenkamp's father did not resist the gesture and returned the smile, flanked by his lawyer, Dup de Bruyn.

Aimee Pistorius, the sister of the double amputee, observed the meeting, but did not take part in discussions.

Mr Nel continued to cross-examine the athlete's probation officer Annette Vergeer, who on Tuesay said 'nothing' could be achieved by locking him up.

She said his disability would leave him vulnerable to the 'violence, sodomy, gun crime and drugs' in South African jails.

As Ms Vergeer was grilled by Mr Nel about her portrayal of South Africa's overcrowded prisons, the athlete's uncle, Arnold, was seen surfing various web pages about standards in jail on his smartphone.

Pistorius spent much of his probation officer's cross examination writing in a notebook.

He looked up briefly as Mr Nel reminded Ms Vergeer that even though she had portrayed the athlete as posing no danger to society and claimed the fatal shooting was his first offence, Pistorius had in fact fired a gun in a crowded restaurant only a month before he killed his girlfriend.

He noted that he was convicted of negligently handling a firearm as a result.

Taylor has described Pistorius as a 'possessive' lover who was rarely seen without a gun. 

The hearing continues.
