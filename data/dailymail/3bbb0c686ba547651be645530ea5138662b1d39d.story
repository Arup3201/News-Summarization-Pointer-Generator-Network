AC/DC's Malcolm Young had to rehearse songs he had played for 30 years everyday before doing a show, just so he could remember them.

Lead guitarist Angus Young noticed there was something wrong with his brother during their Black Ice World Tour six years ago when he really struggled with his worsening dementia.

He told the ABC's 7:30 report his brother's illness was noticeable when they were writing songs together.

Despite retiring in September due to his dementia, Malcolm Young wanted the band to continue 'making music'

'Malcolm was always very organised and it was very strange for the first time I had seen him disorganised, being confused about a lot of things so that's when it hit me that something was not right,' said Angus. 

While Angus spoke to Malcolm, telling him he didn't need to continue if he didn't feel up to it, Malcolm was determined to carry on.

It was in September Malcolm finally retired from the band when he couldn't remember the songs anymore.

'Mal kept up right up until he couldn't do it no more,' Angus told the 7:30 report. 

'It was a strange feeling because your work mate, you worked with for the last, for me 35 years wasn't there anymore,' said lead singer Brian Johnson.

'We always collaborated and bounced off each other,' said Angus of his brother Malcolm

The decision had to be made as to whether the band should keep going and Johnson claims it was really a decision for Angus, who was one part of a sibling team who created 'these riffs that nobody else made'.

'We always collaborated and bounced off each other,' said Angus.

The pair masterminded the massive hit 'Highway to Hell' which Angus says sprung on him one day, the name of the song coming after a cigarette and a trip to the toilet. 

It was essentially Malcolm who decided the band's fate and insisted the band 'keep making music' but they were able to keep it in the family when they hired Stevie Young, the pair's nephew, to replace him.

Lead singer Brian Johnson (pictured left) and lead guitarist Angus Young (pictured right) said AC/DC carried on because Malcolm said he wanted to band to 'keep making music'

He had played with the band before, on a tour in 1988.

It was then AC/DC stayed together and put out their next album - their first without Malcolm - entitled Rock Or Bust. 

Malcolm Young is now in a special care home in Sydney.
