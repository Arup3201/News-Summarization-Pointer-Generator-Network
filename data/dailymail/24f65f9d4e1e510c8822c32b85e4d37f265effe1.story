Labour has asked the Treasury to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power.

Despite a revolt from some Labour MPs over the new annual levy, shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he aimed to hit better-off homeowners in the next financial year.

It is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, but Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough into the NHS as quickly as possible.

The shadow Chancellor said Treasury officials were already working on the proposals, in line with the civil service’s practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election.

Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after George Osborne’s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the autumn statement, which have made buying a home worth £1 million or more far more expensive.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy – but suggested it might have to be amended following the Chancellor’s changes.

Labour opponents of its version of a mansion tax has also stepped up their campaign to persuade Mr Balls to shift his position.

But the shadow Chancellor, in an interview with the Independent, insisted: 'Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.'

The Shadow Chancellor denied this would amount to retrospective legislation.

'A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. We will be clear what we are going to do in our manifesto. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,' he insisted.

'I am sure that the Treasury will be gearing up to make sure we can deliver this.'

The coalition has sought to undermine Mr Balls's pledge to raise £2.5bn for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £3bn boost at the autumn statement. Critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next Parliament.

If unable to impose the tax that early, Mr Balls said Labour would will legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year, 2016-17, 'as a backstop'.

Labour’s mansion tax will be about £3,000 a year for homes in the £2m to £3m bracket, with far higher annual charges running into tens of thousands of pounds for more expensive properties.

To raise the £1.2bn a year Labour predicts, experts say an average charge of £11,000 a year will need to be levied.

The proposal has been criticised by most of the Labour MPs in the running to be the next Mayor of London, given the capital will bear the brunt of the tax.

The Conservatives have branded it a 'homes tax' and predict it will quickly be extended to cover cheaper properties to raise the forecast revenues.
