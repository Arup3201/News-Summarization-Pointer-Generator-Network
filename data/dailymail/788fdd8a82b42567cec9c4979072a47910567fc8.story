A gala dinner for Caribbean  football  officials  hosted by England’s doomed 2018 World Cup bid is being looked at by FIFA investigator Michael Garcia.

It has emerged that Garcia quizzed England 2018 officials  during interviews in London last year about them  picking up the whopping  £35,000 bill  for a Trinidad dinner for 160 people from the  Caribbean  Football Union  in Port of Spain in February 2010.

The event was part of a flawed effort  to woo  the influential  former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who has since quit football in disgrace  following his  cash for votes involvement in Mohamed bin Hammam’s  aborted bid for the FIFA presidency.

There was no secret about England 2018 picked up what looks like an inflated dinner  tab with Warner saying on the eve of the bash : 'It is costing the FA about £35,000, but I think it is money well spent as it allows them to speak to all 32 countries from the CFU.

'It also means I will be able to get the collective view of my membership about who they think should host the World Cup when the time comes for me to decide. And in light of the harsh economic conditions we are battling in the region, the FA has agreed to formally partner with us.'

Making a meal of it! Gala dinner was an effort to woo former FIFA vice president Jack Warner

At the time England 2018 said the £35,000 payment would allow the CFU to spend the money they save on football projects.  The sum is just a fraction of the £1m Qatar spent sponsoring the Confederation of African Football’s   Congress .

New York attorney Garcia’s report into the bidding process of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups  is due to be delivered to FIFA next month. There has been speculation that he will not single out  one bidding country  but say all of them breached regulations in various ways.

England 2018 were eliminated from the World Cup bid in the first round, winning just two votes, one of which came from Geoff Thompson, the English representative on the voting FIFA ExCo.
