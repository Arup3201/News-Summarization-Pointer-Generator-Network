The crisis in Crimea won't keep President Barack Obama from forging ahead with a weekend getaway with his wife and daughters in the Florida Keys.

But it's more than the Oval Office that will be dark as Russia's incursion into Ukraine reaches its one week mark. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife are vacationing in the Virgin Islands. And national security adviser Susan Rice is traveling in the Middle East for meetings with her counterparts.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said 'there's always a chance' Obama could cut a trip short and return to Washington, but this weekend's vacation appeared solid.

'The fact of the matter is what the 
president is doing this weekend in Florida is essentially what the 
president would be doing if he stayed back at the White House,' Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama. The president, he said, was looking forward to 'getting a little bit of downtime in the warm weather with his wife and daughters.'

Obama's
 vacation at a private club on one of the islands off Florida's southern
 tip was tacked onto an afternoon visit by the president and his wife, 
Michelle, to a Miami high school to announce new Education Department 
initiatives to help more students complete the paperwork needed to 
qualify for federal financial aid or student loans.

Every president gets criticized for the amount of time he spends away from the White House, and Obama is no different.

Paul
 C. Light, who teaches public service at New York University, said Obama
 would have been wise to remain in Washington. Being in Florida with a 
still-fluid situation in Ukraine 'makes the president look less interested in the issue than he clearly is,' Light said. 'It's just very bad optics.'

Obama
 departed the White House one day after moving to levy financial 
sanctions and travel bans against those the U.S. accuses of threatening 
Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial borders. Officials in Crimea, a 
pro-Russian area of Ukraine, plan to hold a referendum March 16 to 
decide whether to become part of Russia.

Obama
 and Biden's decision to continue with their weekend vacation plans 
appeared to be an indication that the White House did not expect any 
quick resolution to the dispute.

Nevertheless,
 the White House made clear that Obama is staying on top of developments
 in Ukraine, noting that the president called German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel after arriving in Key Largo. Merkel has been cautious about 
imposing sanctions on Russia.

The
 Obama family vacation comes just a few weeks after the president's long
 weekend at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, California.

Obama
 had gone to Sunnylands to meet with King Abdullah II of Jordan. He 
stayed behind with a gaggle of childhood friends to play golf on the 
desert property's nine-hole course and on a private, 19-hole course 
elsewhere in the city that is owned by supporter Larry Ellison, 
co-founder of the Oracle software company and one of the richest men in 
America.

Obama will have plenty of opportunities to play golf this weekend, too.

He
 checked his family into the Ocean Reef Club, a private, 
by-invitation-only membership club that is more of a gated, 
self-contained community sprawled across 2,500 acres on the northern 
edge of Key Largo. The property has two championship golf courses. 
There's also a swimming lagoon, tennis courts, a spa and fitness center,
 shopping and more than a dozen restaurants among the club's varied 
offerings.

Accommodation costs up to $2,500 per night.

Obama
 flew by helicopter from Miami over the sun-kissed, blue waters of 
Florida Bay to arrive at the club's private airport. Scores of people 
apparently had driven their golf carts over to witness the arrival.

The
 Republican National Committee used Obama's vacation to draw a contrast 
with Americans still grappling with a sluggish economy.

'While
 President Obama vacations in the Florida Keys and Vice President Biden 
is spending his weekend in the Virgin Islands, millions of middle-class 
Americans are hurting from their failed economic policies,' RNC chairman Reince Priebus said.

The vacation is Obama's third of the year.

Before

 Sunnylands, Obama and his family followed tradition and spent Christmas
 and New Year's in Hawaii, where he was born. The president and his 
daughters returned to the White House on January 5, but Mrs Obama spent a
 third week on the island to begin celebrating her 50th birthday later 
that month.

The family will scatter in less than two weeks.

Mrs.
 Obama departs March 19 for a weeklong trip to China without the 
president, but accompanied by daughters Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12, and 
her mother, Marian Robinson. A few days after they leave, Obama will 
embark on a weeklong trip through the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and 
Saudi Arabia.
