According to a leading psychiatrist, parents should avoid being ‘tigers’, at no point become ‘jellyfish’ and do their best to raise their offspring as though they were a ‘dolphin’.

This might sound bafflingly irrelevant to the daily grind of the school run, but mother-of-three Dr Shimi Kang believes children of micromanaging tiger parents risk suffering from anxiety and depression.

Mother-of-three Dr Shimi Kang claims 
‘tiger’ parents - who ‘overparent’ and micromanage their children’s 
lives in a bid to achieve excellence – end up removing their child’s 
sense of internal control and self-motivation.

According to psychiatrist Dr Shimi Kang, parents should neither become 'jellyfish' - who bring children up to lack self-control - nor 'tigers', who 'overparent' and micromanage their children's lives

At the other end of the spectrum, permissive 'jellyfish' parents raise children who lack self-control and have poor social skills.

However dolphin parents have rules and expectations, but value creativity and independence.

The doctor, whose book, The Dolphin Way, is published this month, said this type of parenting has two distinct parts.

‘The first is a balanced, authoritative parent-child relationship,’ she said.

Parents should do their best to raise their offspring as though they 
were a 'dolphin' because those parents apparently have rules and
 expectations - but also value creativity and independence

‘The second is a balanced lifestyle, including what many of today’s kids are missing – play and exploration, a sense of community and contribution, and the basics of regular sleep, exercise and rest.

‘Parents must stop over-scheduling, overprotecting and being over-competitive to allow their children the time and space to activate their own intrinsic motivators.’

Dr Kang, who trained at Harvard, said children of tiger parents are at higher risk of anxiety, depression, entitlement, poor decision-making, and difficulty establishing healthy independence.

Children of jellyfish parents may turn to peers for guidance and fail to develop self-control.

‘They (children of jellyfish parents) are at higher risk of poor social skills, risk-taking behaviours, and substance use,' she said. 

‘Many modern parents flip-flop between tiger and jellyfish leaving their child with no consistent message.’
