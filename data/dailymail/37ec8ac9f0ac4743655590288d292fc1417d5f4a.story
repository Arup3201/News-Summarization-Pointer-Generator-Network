Roy Keane has revealed he profited from the controversial takeover of Manchester United by the Glazer family in 2005.

The former United skipper admits in his book The Second Half, that he had shares in the club as part of his contract and that the takeover earned him money.

In the latest startling revelation from his book, Keane said: 'From the players’ point of view, it didn’t bother us too much. I had a few shares in the club as part of my contract. So the Glazers coming in was worth a few bob to me.'

Keane wrote about the Glazer's 2005 takeover in his new autobiography The Second Half 

Malcolm Glazer, who died last May aged 85, took United in to private ownership nine years ago via a highly-leveraged buy-out, plunging the club more than £500million in debt.

Many United fans will always blame Glazer for the money his family’s company have drained from Old Trafford over the years to service their enormous debts.

Glazer’s aggressive pursuit and purchase of United changed the club forever, leading one group of fans to breakaway to set up non-league outfit FC United while another launched the ‘Green and Gold’ campaign that tried so hard to drive the Americans out four years ago.

During the Glazer years, however, United still managed to win five Barclays Premier League titles and one Champions League.
