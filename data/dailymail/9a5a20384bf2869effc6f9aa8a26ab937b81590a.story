Ed Miliband's policy to pump more money into the NHS would not produce the £2.5billion until 2017/18

Labour's key pledge to spend an extra £2.5billion a year on the NHS was in tatters last night, after it emerged that the money would not start trickling into NHS coffers until the middle of the next Parliament.

Ed Miliband used his main conference speech two weeks ago to announce a mansion tax, the proceeds of which would go towards the Health Service.

The £2.5billion Time to Care Fund would be paid for by a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and a tax avoidance crackdown – all of which would need legislation before the money could be spent.

The Labour leader said his plan would help transform the NHS. Mr Miliband did not, however, mention that the policy would take time to phase in and would not produce the £2.5billion until 2017/18, depriving the Health Service of the money in the meantime.

Sources close to shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the Guardian that none of the money would be available in the first year and only an unspecified amount would be available in the second year, because the party would need to steer a budget through Parliament before the taxes could be spent on the NHS.

Last night, Conservative and Lib Dem MPs accused Labour of deceit and ‘hypocritical posturing’ over an issue Ed Miliband hopes will help win the General Election in May.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The centrepiece of Labour’s conference now lies in tatters. We have consistently said that the measures Ed Miliband set out wouldn’t raise anything like what he promised.

‘And now it’s clear that even the Shadow Chancellor agrees. NHS patients and staff deserve better than dishonesty and hypocritical posturing.’

Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said: ‘They have been found out. This turns out to be an attempt to deceive people. The policy is less than a fortnight old and it has completely unravelled. How did they think that they could get away with it?

‘Labour claims to be the party of the NHS, but you can’t protect the NHS if you can’t manage the economy.

‘Labour haven’t come clean about their NHS funding figures and now the true story is appearing.’

The Conservatives have pledged to continue giving the NHS real-term increases throughout the five years of the next Parliament. The Liberal Democrats plan to do the same, and to give it a further £1billion a year from 2016.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘Our aim is to build up the £2.5billion-a-year fund as quickly as we can in the next Parliament.’

But Professor Chris Ham, chief executive of the King’s Fund health think-tank, called on Labour to clarify its plans.

‘NHS leaders need certainty to manage budgets and plan services for patients,’ he said, adding: ‘Having raised expectations, Labour needs to make clear exactly how much, and when, additional funding will be provided to relieve the unprecedented pressures on NHS budgets.’
