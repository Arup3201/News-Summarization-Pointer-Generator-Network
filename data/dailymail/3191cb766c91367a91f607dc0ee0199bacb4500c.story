Desperate: Shaker Aamer, who can only speak to his family via Skype from Guantanamo Bay

For a few agonising moments, the iPad screen was blank. Then, at last, it flickered to life, to be filled by a familiar round face with a white-flecked beard and deeply-etched lines.

Though the man forced one of his big, trademark smiles, fear and misery were seared in his eyes; though he tried to sound optimistic. Gathered around the screen, his family bolstered his spirits with uplifting stories about their lives – how his children were faring well at school and growing up to make him proud; yet they, too, struggled to mask their sorrow.

Relayed 4,600 miles from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Battersea, South London via Skype, this was Detainee 239 Shaker Aamer’s first call to his wife, Zin, and four children (aged between 17 and 13), for two and a half years.

Since 2012, the US authorities had forbidden the last British resident being held in the detention camp from communicating with his family, and his only contact with the world beyond his grim cell had come via occasional meetings with lawyers.

Perplexingly, however, Mr Aamer – who has been held without trial for 13 years since being captured in Afghanistan and handed to American forces fighting the Taliban – has been permitted to make two Skype calls to them in the past month.

The most recent lasted an hour and came last Thursday: the day the Daily Mail began campaigning for his release on the grounds that to imprison anyone – even if they turn out to be a very bad man – indefinitely without testing their guilt or innocence before a court of law violates the most fundamental principle of western justice.

The emotion-charged call, facilitated by the International Red Cross (who provided the iPad), was described yesterday by Mr Aamer’s father-in-law, Saeed Siddique, 72, who remained in the room for the first 15 minutes, before withdrawing so that his daughter and grandchildren could speak to him privately.

Mr Siddique, a softly-spoken retired imam, told me: ‘One of the first things that Shaker wanted to know was whether anyone outside our family cared about him or whether he had just been quietly forgotten.

‘We didn’t know then that the Daily Mail had decided to fight his cause, so we had to be truthful and tell him that no one was writing about his case. He looked very disappointed but when we are able to tell him about your campaign the next time we speak, it will give him new heart.

‘We have no idea why they are allowing Shaker to call us now, after such a long and very painful silence. It might be a sign that something is about to happen, but we have been disappointed so many times that we daren’t raise our hopes.’

Mr Siddique recalls that his son-in-law has been held in Guantanamo since 2002. His family expected him to be released in February 2009 – coming home on the same London-bound plane as Binyamin Mohammed, another British resident who had been detained in the US camp.

The family decked the house with balloons and ‘Welcome Home’ bunting. But it had to be taken down when Aamer was not released.

Mr Siddique suspects that the reason, despite having been cleared for release by the Americans, was because it was feared he would reveal bombshell secrets about his years in detention that would be highly damaging to the Labour government. Stressing that he thinks it is a party political issue, he says: ‘The Tories and David Cameron seem genuinely interested in bringing him home, but Labour did absolutely nothing – just promises and going to pointless meetings.

‘I think they wanted to leave him there because MI6 had warned them what would happen if he came back.’

Mr Aamer’s London lawyer, Irene Nembhard, concurs. In fact, she goes further, suggesting that the reason the Americans haven’t released him – despite freeing 18 other detainees in recent weeks – might be because they are relying on flawed ‘intelligence’, provided many years ago by the British security services, warning them that it wouldn’t be safe to send him back to Britain. Whatever the truth, his family say he would welcome the opportunity to stand trial in a British court, or indeed any court, to prove his innocence. For their part, the American authorities contend that he left London for Kabul shortly before the 9/11 attacks to join Al Qaeda and that he served as Osama bin Laden’s personal interpreter.

However, Mr Aamer denies this. He maintains – suspicious as it undeniably sounds – that he went to live in Afghanistan to experience life in an Islamic country and to do charity work, having been presented with obstacles when he applied to move his family to his native Saudi Arabia, to be near his parents.

When the War on Terror broke out, he says, he attempted to return to Britain but was captured by the keepers of a guesthouse where he was lodging and sold to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, who, in turn, sold him to the Americans for a $5,000 bounty.

‘Why would he have applied to live in Saudi, if he had wanted to fight with the Taliban or Al Qaeda?’ asks his father-in-law Siddique incredulously, as the country’s government broke links with the terror organisations many years ago. ‘He approached the Saudi embassy in London and had two or three meetings with them.

‘He would welcome the chance to tell all this to a British court. If there’s anything against him, let them put him before a judge and jury.’ Mr Siddique added that – as the family patriarch – he would personally vouch for his son-in-law’s good behaviour, were he to be returned to Britain.

What’s more, he is convinced that his son-in-law would not – if released or cleared – follow the example of several of the other British former detainees who obtained huge compensation after suing the Government.

The day before last Thursday’s Skype call, Mr Aamer met his human rights lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, at Guantanamo. Until Washington declassifies records of their encounter, he is not permitted to reveal what passed between them.

However, the lawyer says that Detainee 239 ‘boomed with laughter’ when he told him about the Senate Committee’s torture report, and the CIA’s self-justifying response to it.

The reason for his ironic mirth was clear. Though his name doesn’t appear in the shameful report, when Mr Stafford Smith asked him, some time ago, to catalogue his torture, he replied that it would be quite impossible – because he had endured it, albeit in a sometimes subtle form, on every one of the 4,600-odd days he has been in custody.

‘If he were to write it all down, it would be ten times as long as the abridged report released by the Senate,’ Mr Stafford Smith says.

It is a sobering thought. Sobering, too, to learn that while incarcerated, Shaker Aamer’s father, a brother and a sister have died. His mother is ‘critically ill’, according to Mr Siddique, who says she might not live long.

She is blind and will never see her son again – but it would come as some comfort to know that her son might, one day soon, be freed and not have to depend on Skype to be in contact with his wife and children.
