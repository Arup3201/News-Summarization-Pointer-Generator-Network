Best-selling author Hilary Mantel has revealed how her fantasies about killing Margaret Thatcher inspired her new short story about her assassination.

The 62-year-old has recalled how she once spotted the former Prime Minister standing unguarded near her Windsor flat in 1983 and imagined shooting her.

The fantasy was the inspiration for her short story, The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher, which will be published at the end of the month.

But her comments have already sparked anger with one Conservative MP describing them as 'shocking'.

Miss Mantel whose best-selling novels about the Tudors have been adapted into a BBC series called Wolf Hall, has told how she feels ‘boiling detestation’ for the politician.

In an interview with The Guardian, she said Baroness Thatcher was an anti-feminist and ‘psychological transvestite’, who did ‘long-standing damage’ to the country.

It is not the first controversy the author has been caught up in. In 2013, she said the Duchess of Cambridge had gone from being a ‘jointed doll on which certain rags are hung’ to a woman whose ‘only point and purpose’ was to give birth.

The new short story tells of a well-off woman waiting in her Windsor flat for a plumber.

The man she lets in turns out to be an assassin who wants to use her bedroom to shoot Baroness Thatcher as she leaves the private hospital opposite after an eye operation. 

Mantel described how she used her finger and thumb to form a gun when Baroness Thatcher wandered into view at noon on Saturday, August 6, 1983.

She said: ‘Immediately your eye measures the distance, I thought, “if I wasn’t me, if I was someone else, she’d be dead”.’

Waving: The story, published in the Guardian, was inspired by a 1983 sighting of Mrs Thatcher in a window

Nadine Dorries, Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire, told MailOnline this morning: 'I cannot quite believe it. I am gutted because Hilary Mantel is one of my favourite authors. 

'It is shocking as it is so close (to Margaret Thatcher's death) and she still has living family and children. It is about a character whose demise is so recent.' 

Later in the interview Miss Mantel reveals she did not considered herself to be either of the two characters featured in the short story and instead was 'standing by the window with the notebook'.

Miss Mantel, a two-time Man Booker prizewinner, said the book had taken 30 years to write, but dismissed the idea she had been waiting for Baroness Thatcher’s death to write it.

‘I am concerned with respect, I’m not concerned with taste,’ she said, adding: ‘I would have happily concluded the story in her lifetime but couldn't – it was my technical difficulty, not any delicacy. I believe in walking that line. You mustn't be too timid to risk getting it wrong.’

The story has been hotly anticipated ever since news of its title was unveiled in January this year. 

In the interview, she describes Mrs Thatcher as having caused ‘long-standing damage' in many areas of national life.

She says the former Prime Minister was a 'fantastic' character to write about about and that 'as a citizen, I suffered from her but as a writer, I benefited.'
