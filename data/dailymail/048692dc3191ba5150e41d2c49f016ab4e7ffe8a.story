Jodi Arias admitted to killing ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander on Wednesday but said she could not remember stabbing him 27 times or whether she had slit his throat with a kitchen knife.

On the most explosive day of her murder trial, Arias testified that there was a 'huge gap' in her memory from June 4, 2008 - the day that Alexander died at his Mesa, Arizona home.

Arias told jurors that she and Alexander had been taking naked pictures in his shower when she dropped his camera, causing him to erupt in a rage, body-slamming her against the tiles and threatening to kill her.

In tears: Jodi Arias cried on the stand throughout her testimony on Wednesday as she told how she ran away from Travis Alexander and threatened him with his own gun in an effort to make him stop

The big moment: Arias said that she does not remember stabbing him 27 times with the knife or dragging his body into the shower before fleeing the scene and trying to 'cover her tracks'

She said that she managed to roll out of the bathroom and ran through 
Alexander’s home to escape as he chased her.

She went to hide in his closet when she remembered that was where Alexander hid his gun.

'He was angry at me and he wasn't going to stop,' she said. 'It was like mortal terror.'

The 32-year-old told the court on Wednesday that she pointed the weapon at him but never meant to pull 
the trigger.

‘I pointed it at him with both of my hands I thought that would stop him, if someone pointed a gun at me it would stop me,’ she tearfully told the Phoenix court.

‘The gun went off i didn’t mean to shoot him or anything I didn’t even think i was on the trigger.

‘He lunged at me and we fell really hard against the tile toward the other wall… so at this point i didn’t even know if he had been shot.

‘After the gun went off I thought ''crap because now he's really going to be pissed'' because I didn’t know I had shot him.’

Arias said that she blacked out at several points that day and has no memory of stabbing Alexander 27 times with his own kitchen knife - before putting the instrument in the dishwasher.

The murder suspect said that it was the same knife that her on-off lover had brought upstairs earlier in the day to cut rope that he had used to bind her wrists during a graphic sex session.

Distress: Arias struggled through her testimony on Wednesday as the court heard explosive details of how she killed Travis Alexander in his Mesa home in 2008

She said: ‘I have a few memories but nothing is super clear. I have a vague memory of putting the knife in the dishwasher, but I put the knife in the dishwasher before but I'm pretty sure it was that night.

‘I remember I was in the bathroom. I 
remember dropping the knife and it clang to the tile, it made a big 
noise, and i just remember screaming. I don't remember anything after 
that.’

She said when she left the home, she 'didn't think Travis was alive but hoped he was'.

She was asked by her defense attorney why she did not call 911. Arias answered: 'I was scared. I couldn't imagine calling 911 and telling them what I had just done. I was scared of what would happen to me.'

Arias told the court she also remembered disposing of Alexander's gun in the desert on her way from Arizona to California.

She also told the courtroom that to 'throw the scent off for a little while' she began to form an alibi - leaving a voice mail on Alexander's phone and traveling to see a friend in Utah.

For seven days, Arias has answered in detail to questions from the defense including about the sordid 
sexual relationship that she had with Alexander.

Wednesday was the 
first time that she spoke about the moment when Alexander died.

Arias is facing the death 
penalty if convicted of the first-degree murder of 30-year-old 
Alexander. She had claimed that she killed him in self-defense. The prosecution said that she killed her lover in a jealous rage.

Throughout 
the trial, Arias has painted a picture of how she was allegedly mentally 
and emotionally abused by Alexander who she described as hot-headed and 
aggressive. She also said that he tried to kill her once before.

Hiding spot: Arias ran from the bathroom into Alexander's closet which had two exits in order to get away from him, but then she remembered where he hid his gun on the top shelf of his closet

The scene: The defense attorney showed a picture of Alexander's closet and Arias pointed out where he hid his gun on a top shelf which she knew because she cleaned it previously when she was working as his maid

Her story: Arias' defense is based entirely around the fact that she killed Alexander in self-defense and that she lied multiple times to investigators because she was trying to avoid jail

The focus of Wednesday’s testimony was the events of June 4, 2008. Arias' mother wiped her eyes while in court while Travis Alexander's two sisters looked down as their brother's last moments were described.

After a long road trip from her home in California, Arias had decided to stop by Alexander’s house in Mesa, Arizona and spend two nights.

After the first court recess, Arias went on
to describe what happened following Alexander's death on June 4.

She began developing alternate versions of events which she told police investigator Esteban Flores when he questioned her repeatedly about the murder.

Firstly, she said that she was not in
Arizona at the time of his death and later that a man and a woman broke
into his home and attacked Alexander.

Arias said on Wednesday: 'I began to 
tell him things that I thought would comport with what the forensics 
would show as well as create-not an excuse but- create a way that would 
have me not have been responsible for it.'

Emotional: Arias said that her actions following the murder- which included driving to Las Vegas, spending time with another romantic interest, and leaving voicemails on Alexander's phone- were to 'throw them off the scent'

Final moments: She got choked up when she was shown one of the pictures she took of Alexander during their shower photo shoot, and she was unsure whether or not that was the final picture she took of him

Hardest day: Alexander's sisters looked down as Arias told of the moment he was killed

Support: Arias' mother was seen wiping her eyes with tissues at different points during the testimony

As for her rationale as to why she would develop the story that a man and a woman broke into the house, she said that it was both practical (‘Flores told me repeatedly that it had to have been more than one person’) and symbolic.

She said: ‘It sounds a little esoteric but it could have been symbolic: it’s like Travis and I were the ones fighting that day.'

She said that she attended Alexander's memorial service to keep up appearances and wanted to go to his funeral but was unable to make it.

‘I thought that if I didn’t show up it would look suspicious because Travis and I were close and a lot of people knew that,’ she said.

Another reason she wanted to attend was because during their relationship, the pair had a conversation about what Alexander would do if she were ever to die.

Arias told the court: ‘He was going to give a eulogy if I ever died… he said he would have come to mine even if it was in Antarctica.'

Contemplation: Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi works out his next move as his client Jodi Arias explains to the court how she killed lover Travis Alexander

She also explained today why, in all the times she spoke about her relationship with Alexander prior to the trial, she never mentioned his alleged violence, their sexual relationship or his supposed sexual fantasies about children.

She said: ‘I was very concerned about both of our reputations and I didn't want to start throwing him under the bus so to speak because there were already people hurting and I didn’t see what benefit it would be to talk about those things.'

During the time between the June 4 murder and her arrest on July 15, Arias purchased a gun.

Her defense lawyer Kirk Nurmi repeatedly asked her about whether or not she tried to kill herself following the murder, though she said that the purchase of her gun had nothing to do with her suicide plans.

‘I wanted to someday see myself being a responsible gun owner so that was something I had always seen myself doing,’ she said. 

Following a short afternoon recess, Arias discussed interviews that she had done while in prison with CBS and Inside Edition where she said she was 'under the microscope at that point'.

Arias said that she felt pressured by a sheriff's officer to do the interview with Inside Edition against her attorney's advice.

During this interview she said: 'No jury will ever convict me'. Her attorney asked her on Wednesday why she had said those words to which Arias explained that she had seen them used on a TV crime drama and that they appeared to be 'powerful' and 'eloquent'.

She also told the court that she planned to commit suicide in prison.

‘I took [a razor] apart one night with intentions of slitting my wrists… I asked for extra laundry because there was someone sleeping below me so that I could stuff it around my body because I didn’t want anything to get on her. I couldn’t bring myself to do it,' she said.

The defense ended questioning today. The trial resumes at 10am on Thursday.
