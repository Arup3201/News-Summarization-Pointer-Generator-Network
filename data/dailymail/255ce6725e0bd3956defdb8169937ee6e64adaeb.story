You and I might think  potholes are a bad thing – but the roads minister has claimed they are actually the sign of a booming economy.

Robert Goodwill said craters are being caused by the recovery, as more people get jobs and use their cars to get to work.

He also claimed that streets are suffering more wear and tear as consumer spending rises – causing an increase in the number of delivery drivers on the roads.

His comments came days after Home Office minister James Brokenshire gave a similar explanation for a huge backlog of passport applications.

He told the House of Commons that delays were due  to a ‘significant surge’ in applications which was ‘an indication that as the economy is improving more people are understandably planning to travel’.

Tory Mr Goodwill told LBC Radio yesterday: ‘We have seen more traffic on the roads – we have seen a 4 per cent increase in traffic in the first quarter of this year in comparison to a year ago.

‘That is because more goods are travelling around as the economy improves, more people are travelling to work as they get jobs, so this means the roads are getting more wear and tear.’

His claims came after the Government revealed how it would spend £168million to end the ‘menace’ of potholes by filling in more than  three million before the next general election.

To secure cash from the Pothole Repair Fund, local authorities will have to publish monthly progress updates on how many they have fixed.

Some 148 councils applied for funding, and ministers said every single one will receive a share. All repair works will have to be completed by the end of March next year – two months before the next election.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘Potholes are the bane of all our lives and the funding announced today is an important step in ridding our roads of this menace.’

The AA welcomed the cash injection, but warned that potholes were not the only road maintenance ‘menace’ that needed to be tackled.

The group’s president Edmund King said: ‘Potholes in the  UK have been a long-running scourge that has cost tens  of thousands of car owners millions of pounds in repair bills,  and councils millions in compensation claims. The new government money is very welcome, but it will only be truly effective if roads are re-surfaced on time and not just patched up after each winter.’

The AA also called for a fund to allow councils to switch street lights to cheaper, greener  and more fuel-efficient technologies rather than switch them  off altogether.
