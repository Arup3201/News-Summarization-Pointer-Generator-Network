The dramatic moment an office worker came within inches of being killed when a truck crashed into the office wall behind her has been caught on camera.

Incredible CCTV footage taken at a business in Toledo, Brazil, shows a young female receptionist sitting at her desk – then a large pick-up truck smashing through the wall behind her.

Seconds before the crash the woman smiles and stands up and is then pushed out of shot by the truck as it pushes debris into the office. 

Calm before the storm: All is well at this office in Toledo, Brazil - but things are about to take a turn for the dramatic

Rammed: The receptionist watches in horror as a truck crashes into the wall behind her

Chaos: The worker is shunted along by the truck as the wall completely disintegrates

The truck completely destroys the wall and the office entrance.

Another angle shows how three other office workers made a lucky escape, narrowly avoiding being hit head-on by the out-of-control vehicle.

The clip shows the driver pointing towards the road behind him as he sits at the wheel.

Local media reported that a collision with another vehicle had sent him careering into the office so he may have been trying to explain this.

Seconds after the crash the workers gather round to check everyone is okay.

Only minor injuries were sustained by those in the building, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Damage: The truck completely destroys the wall and the entrance

Lucky escapes: Several other office workers came close to being seriously hurt or killed by the truck

Aftermath: This shows the extent of the damage the truck caused
