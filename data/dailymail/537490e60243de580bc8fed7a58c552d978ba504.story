Borussia Dortmund's mini renaissance which had seen them win four Bundesliga games in succession came to a halt, as they were held to a frustrating goalless draw at Hamburg.  

The tight contest saw the visitors dominate possession, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus typically at the heart of Dortmund's attacks, but try as they might, they could not circumvent a well-drilled Hamburg defence.  

Despite an early injury to captain Johan Djourou, the hosts were able to weather the storm from Jurgen Klopp's men.

The result will benefit neither team much at all. For Dortmund, it is a blow to their aspirations of qualifying for continental football next season, while relegation-threatened Hamburg remain without a win in their last four league outings. 

Dortmund had started the game strongly with Reus, passed fit after an injury scare earlier in the week, finding Aubameyang with a free-kick only for Hamburg's Djourou to make a timely intervention. 

Hamburg striker Nicolai Muller fired wide a few minutes later, but chances otherwise came at a premium during the first-half. 

Djourou, following a head collision with a Dortmund player, was substituted in the 18th minute.

Dortmund introduced Kevin Kampl to the game after the restart and the Sloveninan nearly made an instant impact on 55 minutes, but blasted his shot just wide from the edge of the box, before Reus squandered a similar chance a few moments later. 

It was a routine that seemed to repeat, with every Dortmund effort finding itself wide, blocked through the final pass.
