Planned Parenthood has been accused of 'consistently recommending' the Fifty Shades of Grey series to 'minor girls.'

As part of an ongoing investigation, Live Action - a pro-life nonprofit - has been sending female investigators to Planned Parenthood clinics around the country with hidden cameras, to pose as 15 and 16-year-old girls and asking for advice related to the book.

Live Action president Lila Rose summarized her findings from the footage for the New York Post; claiming that a counselor in Indianapolis said: 'You need to read [Fifty Shades of Grey],' and another in Colorado said: 'It's pretty good.'

Ms Rose reports that another counselor, who labeled the Fifty Shades of Grey series 'extreme', had said: 'If it’s consensual, again, completely normal.' Echoing this sentiment, another counseler claimed to 'personally dislike' the books, but said it would be 'a big eye-opener' for the girl she believed to be 15 years old.  

The best-selling book trilogy, written by British author E. L. James, has been a storming success among a widespread audience; selling over 100 million copies worldwide to date.

It tells the story of Anastasia Steele, a 21-year-old virgin who falls under the spell of Christian Grey; a highly controlling 27-year-old business mogul who takes her as his sex slave.

The books involve countless explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving BDSM; bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, and sadism/masochism. The long-awaited movie, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, is due to hit theaters on Valentine's Day 2015.

During Christian and Anastasia's kinky and often violent sexcapades, Anastasia can signal her genuine distress to Christian by saying the 'safe word' 'yellow' for caution, and 'red' for stop.

Ms Rose is dismissive of the concept of using safe words and points out  that in one scene of Fifty Shades of Grey, Christian ignores Anastasia's use of theirs. She also describes many of the sex scenes as 'reading like rape.'

She writes of Live Action's investigation into Planned Parenthood: 'The staffers’ script was much the same everywhere. 

'All of the employees went on to insist on “trust” and elevating the “safe word” - a word that sex partners who are intent on extreme behavior agree to use as code for “no, stop, and I mean it” - to set-in-stone status.

'In short, Planned Parenthood counselors told our investigators that “no” doesn't mean “no” anymore.'

Upon reviewing the undercover footage however, these soundbites take on quite a different nature when seen in context. In all instances, it is the investigator - posing as the minor - who brings up the issue of BDSM or first mentions Fifty Shades of Grey.

 Rather than 'recommend' the books, most counselors actually appear to be answering questions about BDSM, using the book as a reference to underline the importance of consent.

One counselor at a Minnesota clinic, when quizzed on the book, says: 'Anything within the sexual world is normal as long as it's consensual... My focus really would be on your safety, and just that it's consensual. Those are the two pieces that I would say are the most important part.'

Another, at a Colorado clinic, says: 'You just want it to be safe.'

This counselor, however, does also go into great depth on the subject of the book, and suggests the young girl further explores BDSM by getting someone she 'trusts' to buy related toys from a sex shop, since she is under 18.

'When Planned Parenthood counselors train our girls not to expect that “no” means no, they disable a crucial form of protection for all women in a violent world,' Ms Rose concludes.

'A world of compliant Ana Steeles and repulsive Christian Greys is nothing short of nightmarish. We all should turn away from any road that leads there.'

Lila Rose issued the following statement to MailOnline:

'If a minor girl comes to Planned Parenthood for advice because her boyfriend says he wants to try out "kink," counselors should be strongly cautioning her on the many dangers of those practices. 

'They should NOT be suggesting and promoting a variety of bondage and sadomasochistic activities and recommending pornographic material for more ideas. 

'It's clear that Planned Parenthood's priority here is propagation of its radical sexual ideology, not protecting young girls' safety.'
