A high school had an unusual request for their local fire department today when they asked for assistance with the removal of goats from the roof.

Four animals were rescued from an overhang above the entrance to Simsbury High School in Connecticut this morning.

Teachers believe that the goats may have been placed on the school during the night as a prank by graduating seniors.

Principal Neil Sullivan said the goats were discovered by a janitor at around 5.30am. No injuries were sustained by the janitor teachers, pupils or goats.

The pygmy goats were from Flamig Farm, located about four miles away in West Simsbury, according to local station WFSB.

Mr Sullivan said they were working with police to find out who had put the goats on the school roof, but that they did not want to overreact to the incident.

On the school's website, it is stated: 'The mission of Simsbury High School is to help each student realize his/her potential by learning the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that promote both personal fulfillment and civic responsibility.'
