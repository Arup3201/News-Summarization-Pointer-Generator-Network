Family and friends have attended the funeral of British photographer Kate Barry who was found dead on the pavement beneath her fourth-floor flat in Paris.

Former First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy hid her face behind a scarf and dark glasses as she hugged fellow funeral guests outside The Church of Saint-Roch, in Paris.

Among mourners was her mother - the actress and singer Jane Birkin - as well as her son Roman de Kermadec, 26, and her half-sisters Charlotte Gainsbourg, daughter of the late French singer Serge Gainsbourg and Lou Doillon, daughter of director Jacques Doillon.

Actress Catherine Deneuve, singer Cecile Cassel and actor Yvan Attal also attended the service.

Ms Barry's body was found on December 11 in the 16th arrondissement of the French capital.

Sources say she fell 80ft from a window of her apartment, where anti-depressants were found inside.

It is just a few miles from the flat where Ms Birkin herself now lives on Paris's Left Bank.

Ms Birkin has frequently spoken about her closeness to her daughters.

Earlier this year, she said: 'I've never had a week without having all three of my daughters on the telephone.

'My
 eldest daughter, Kate, looks most like me. She's a photographer. She 
had a Polaroid camera in her hand from a young age and photographed her 
sisters all the time.'

Ms Barry's parents separated in 1967, 
the year she was born in London, and she was brought up until the age of
 13 by Ms Birkin and Gainsbourg, who died in 1991.

She was the daughter of the late James Bond composer John Barry.

At 17, Kate Barry underwent treatment for drug and alcohol addiction in central London.

She had a close relationship with groups including Alcoholics Anonymous and set up a centre for addicts in France in 1993.

Ms Barry began her career as a 
professional photographer in 1996 and her first major exhibition was at 
the Bunkamura Gallery in Tokyo in 2000.

She went on to produce pictures for a variety of publications including British Vogue and the Sunday Times magazine.

Jane Birkin was performing on stage in France when news broke that her daughter was dead.

The
 60s icon, best known for her relationship with Serge Gainsbourg, was 15
 minutes into a concert in Besan√ßon when news of the death of Kate Barry
 began to filter through the auditorium.

According
 to French media, Birkin was singing an emotional song called Javanese a
 capella when her manager was told of the tragedy.

But rather than interrupt the concert, he waited for it to finish before he told Birkin that Ms Barry had been found dead on the pavement beneath her fourth-floor flat in Paris.

'She heard the news just after the 
concert,' a source told the Parisien newspaper. 'The tension was 
palpable backstage, nobody really knew what to do.'

Ms
 Barry was thought to be alone inside the flat before the tragedy 
happened.

'The
 matter is under investigation, but we can confirm the death,' said a 
local police spokesman. He said the front door of the floor was found 
locked.

France's culture 
minister paid a moving tribute to Ms Barry offering 'heartfelt 
and loving thoughts' to 'a family we all love, the French love'.

Aurelie
 Filippetti said Ms Barry had become 'an outstanding photographer who 
understood the very meaning of pictures, staging, light and 
composition'.
