Jams: Friday afternoon is set to be the busiest time on the roads for the entire Christmas period

Journey times on some major roads could more than treble as motorists start the great Friday Christmas getaway, experts have revealed.

Traffic specialists INRIX said tomorrow afternoon from 4pm will be the busiest time over Christmas, with up to 20million cars on the road.

They are blaming a toxic combination of the usual Friday peak with the start of the school holidays and early Christmas break-ups for some workers. 

INRIX said other busy days will include next Tuesday and December 27. 

Major motorways including the M1, the M25 and the M6 are expected to be the worst affected.

The M25’s anti-clockwise stretch between junction 23 and junction 10 is predicted to take around two hours and 20 minutes - compared to a normal 40-minute journey time.

The road with a 70mph limit will see speeds drop to just 18mph, said the INRIX report. Despite extra lanes now in play, it adds to the M25’s reputation as ‘the biggest car park in Europe’ 

Drivers on a 60-mile section of the M1 northbound between junction 21 and junction 32 will see an hour-long journey soar to 2 hours and 25 minutes, more than double the usual time. 

Fifteen-minute journeys are set to almost quadruple to 55 minutes on the M56 eastbound at junction 9 and the M5 northbound at junction 3, with average speeds falling to just 14mph. 

One of the busiest ‘pinch-point’ exit routes out of London will also suffer jams.

The already busy 14.5 mile stretch of the A4 westbound from Hyde Park corner to Heathrow Airport will take more than twice as long as normal to drive, increasing from 35 minutes to 1 hour and 15 minutes, said the report. 

In northern England the 17-mile A1 northbound stretch through Newcastle-upon-Tyne will see journey times more than double from 20 minutes to 45 minutes, with speeds reduced to 22mph. 

There is a normal quieter period over Christmas Day and Boxing Day, with traffic picking up again on Saturday, December 27 as drivers head home after spending Christmas away, return to work or go shopping.

Meanwhile rail passengers also face Christmas chaos over the busy festive holiday period - and are even being advised not to use a key London to Scotland main line.

Engineering works will cause closures, delays, disruption and bus replacements.

Much of the £200million upgrades by 11,000 engineers are being performed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, but delays will hit commuters throughout the festive period.

Repair work on the West Coast main line means it will be shut between Euston station in London and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire after the last trains on Christmas Eve until Monday, December 29.

It will also be closed between Stafford and Crewe after the last trains on Christmas Eve until Sunday 28 December.

Rail bosses say the now almost traditional Christmas repair closures are vital as work continues on ‘improvements’ in the Watford area and between Stafford and Crewe.

To minimise disruption Network Rail and the Virgin Trains and London Midland train companies are advising passengers to avoid the West Coast main line and use alternative routes.

But passenger groups say this is little comfort for those who have to endure the disruption en route to visiting friends and family.

The M4 will be the worst affected, with 34 scheduled works, followed by motorways - M1,  M25, M6 and M5

Heathrow will get off no more lightly, handling almost 700,000 passengers leaving from the west London airport between tomorrow and Christmas Day. Of those, 116,700 will travel tomorrow.

Gatwick will handle 800,000 departures between tomorrow and January 3, with Stansted Airport in Essex handling 430,000.

In addition around 380,000 will leave from Manchester and 160,000 from Birmingham.

Hundreds of thousands of people will also travel across the English Channel by ferry or through the Channel Tunnel, with 250,000 heading off on the high-speed trains of Eurostar.

Greg Hallsworth, lead scientist and traffic analyst at INRIX, said: ‘Drivers would be well advised to steer clear of driving in the afternoon of Friday December 19 as this will be the busiest period on the roads this Christmas.

'There will be significant delays between 12pm and 6pm caused by a combination of the usual Friday evening post-work peak, the start of English school holidays and people driving home for Christmas.

‘Where possible, drivers should look for alternative routes to avoid the busiest roads, and travel outside of peak times.

'It’s worth bearing in mind that the shortest route isn’t necessarily the quickest and that drivers’ normal routes may be worse hit by Christmas traffic than other roads.

'Adverse weather can also have a significant impact on congestion, so check the forecast when planning a trip and try to avoid wet or especially cold periods.’
