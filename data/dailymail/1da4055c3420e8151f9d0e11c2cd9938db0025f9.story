A spooked carriage horse caused a commotion in downtown Savannah, Georgia, Monday afternoon, sending the coach operator to the hospital and damaging five parked cars.

Savannah Chatham Metropolitan police say the buggy, operated by Historic Savannah Carriage Tours, was carrying two women, ages 42 and 67, and three children, ages 12, 10 and 7, from Sleepy Hollow, New York, when the horse pulling the coach began running.

The driver, 37-year-old Ashley Bignault, was ejected from the vehicle and was later hospitalized with a broken heel.

Running wild: A surveillance camera in downtown Savannah, Georgia, captured a carriage drawn by an out-of-control horse careening into parked cars in the city's historic center

Startled: A horse named Oscar carrying five people in the buggy got spooked after losing its bit

The 67-year-old female passenger was treated at a nearby urgent care center and released.

The incident spanned six city blocks and nearby restaurant employees eventually calmed the horse down with carrots, department spokesman Julian Miller said. 

Police say the horse that caused the commotion wasn't injured. The animal was identified as a young Percheron gelding named Oscar.

The incident took place just before 12.30pm Monday as a horse pulling a buggy with five tourists from New York in downtown Savannah broke into a gallop after losing its bit at Bryan and Barnard streets.

According to police, the bridle then became dislodged, making it difficult to control the frightened animal.

A surveillance video of the incident shows the horse running to the south side of Ellis Square and turning to Congress Street, with the coach slamming into the sides of five cars before the driver, Ashley Bignault, is ejected.

Witnesses described the horse and buggy bouncing off parked cars ‘like a pin ball,’ The Augusta Chronicle reported.

‘I heard the horse coming down and said it sounds like it’s going awfully fast for in the city, or for a tour,’ eyewitness Aaron Senne told the station WSAV. ‘I turned around, could see the horse galloping. Hit with its full chest on the side of the Nissan.’

The out-of-control horse eventually made its way to Congress Lane, where employees from a nearby restaurant were able to stop it just short of Bull Street.

According to the website of Historic Savannah Carriage Tours, the company owns nine horses and six carriages.

On the website, Oscar is described as 'the baby of the barn' known for his speed and voracious appetite, which at times drives him to 'sneak towards the edge of the street while on tour to grab a snack off a nearby tree of bush.'

Local officials told the station WJCL that the tour operator has a clean safety record. Bignault has been with the company for six years.

Owner John Tarr described what happened Monday as ‘just an unfortunate accident.’

Nicole and Charles Miller, who were in Savannah on their honeymoon, said the harrowing ordeal has made them think twice about getting into a horse-drawn carriage for a romantic outing.  

‘We were thinking of going on one of those rides. Not now,’ said Mr Miller.
