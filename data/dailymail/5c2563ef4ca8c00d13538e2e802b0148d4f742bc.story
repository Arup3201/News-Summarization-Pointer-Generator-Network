Most American's say they haven't changed their opinion about New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the wake of the bridge-closure scandal according to a new NBC News/Marist poll.

In addition, 44 percent of respondents believe he’s telling the truth about his knowledge of the events surrounding the controversy.

New Jersey voters do not blame Governor Chris Christie for an epic September traffic jam on one of the world's busiest bridges, but do think the scandal will hurt his chances as a 2016 presidential contender, a poll released on Wednesday found.

Abject: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie leaves the Borough Hall in Fort Lee where he apologized to Mayor Mark Sokolich on January 9, 2014 in Fort Lee, New Jersey

The survey also shows that the 
potential 2016 Republican candidate has lost ground to former Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton in an early hypothetical presidential match up 
and now trails her by 13 points.

Lee
 Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion,
 explains that, overall, this is good news for Christie.

'The
 numbers suggest it’s far from politically fatal for him,' he says of 
the scandal, he told NBC News 'This is a developing story, so the extent
 of the damage down the road is an open proposition.'

But
 the down side for Christie, according to Miringoff: Americans ' are 
getting to know to him, and that’s maybe not the best way to introduce 
himself to a national audience.'

The
 prominent U.S. Republican's repeated apologies for the four-day tie-up 
has softened his image with voters who recently reelected him to a 
second term, earning him one of the lowest 'bully' scores recorded in a 
poll by Quinnipiac University.

Christie is leading the pack – barely – in an early trial heat of potential Republican candidates.

When
 Republicans voters were asked whom they support if the GOP primary or 
caucus were held today, 16 percent picked Christie, 12 percent sided 
with 2012 running mate Paul Ryan, 9 percent said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., 
and 8 percent said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

Those percentages are virtually unchanged from last month.

50
 percent of respondents polled believed Christie's statement he did not 
know that a top aide, who he has since fired, called for the closure of 
three lanes on the George Washington Bridge possibly as political 
payback to the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee.

Just 41 percent of the 1,207 voters did not believe Christie's assertions that he did not know his staff had been involved.

Some
 54 percent of voters regarded the former federal prosecutor as more of a
 leader than a bully, with 40 percent labeling him a bully.

The
 poll found 49 percent of those polled said the scandal could damage the
 rising star in the Republican Party in his expected 2016 run for the 
White House, with 38 percent saying the scandal will have no impact.

Many are at odds over whether Governor Christie, who was tipped to run for President in 2016, was involved

Governor Christie is under pressure following revelations that his administration may have closed highway lanes to exact political retribution against a Democratic mayor

'Christie
 for President? This scandal hurts his chances, both Democrats and 
Republicans think,' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac 
University Polling Institute..

The
 findings differ from those found in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on 
Tuesday. That showed the bridge closure scandal had taken a toll on 
Christie's image, with 26 percent of those asked saying they were now 
less favorable toward him, compared with 3 percent, who said they were 
more favorable.

More 
respondents to the Reuters/Ipsos poll believed he had a hand in the 
closures, with 31 percent saying they thought he was aware his staff 
intentionally caused the traffic jam, compared with 28 percent who said 
they believed his statements that he was in the dark.

The survey of 1,200 adults, conducted January 12th to January 14th has a sampling error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

Christie
 said he knew nothing about the purpose of the lane closures until 
Wednesday when it was revealed that his deputy chief of staff, Bridget 
Anne Kelly, had emailed an authority operative, David Wildstein, in 
August, saying, 'Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' a borough 
in New Jersey. Wildstein replied, 'Got it.'

A port authority employee warned  the bridge lane closures created safety risks, but they continued for four days

Tabloid
 newspapers and late night talk show hosts have feasted on the scandal, 
with Jimmy Fallon enlisting New Jersey-raised rock star Bruce 
Springsteen, who Christie has said he adores, to riff on the lane 
closures in a song called 'We're stuck in Governor Chris Christie's Fort
 Lee, New Jersey traffic jam'.

Sung
 to the tune of Springsteen's 'Born to Run', it begins, 'In the day we 
sweated out on the streets, stuck in traffic on the GWB'.

Fallon
 sang: 'They shut down the toll booths of glory, cause we didn't endorse
 Christie ... Whoa, baby this Bridgegate was just payback.'

Springsteen
 joined in: 'You got Wall Street masters stuck cheek-to-cheek with blue 
collared truckers and man, I really gotta take a leak.

But I can't. I'm stuck in Governor Chris Christie's Fort Lee, New Jersey, traffic jam!'
