'Wouldn't mind retiring': Baroness Boothroyd said she would support a retirement age for peers to let new members into the increasingly full House

Former Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd yesterday called for a retirement age to be introduced for elderly peers.

Amid claims that the House of Lords has run out of space, Baroness Boothroyd said that the conditions have become ‘appalling’ and suggested that a time limit could be imposed on peers’ length of service.

A series of up to 20 new appointments are expected within days.

This will boost the total number of peers to 850 – the highest level since most hereditary peers were removed following the House of Lords Act in 1999.

Yesterday peers told how officials have been ‘prowling the corridors’ looking for space to squeeze in more desks for the new recruits.

‘Unseemly fights’ in the chamber have been reported because there are not enough seats for the rising number of peers.

Lady Boothroyd said: ‘It is so overcrowded that there is only space for two thirds of us in the chamber itself. It is appalling.

‘All prime ministers are very keen to put new members in here so they get their legislation through and they pile them in irrespective.

‘It is what I call lobby fodder, they go through the lobbies and vote for the prime minister who put them there.’ She called for ‘proper reform’ so there would be ‘a retirement age or a number of years they should perform here’.

Speaking to Radio 4’s World At One, the 84-year-old added: ‘I’m getting on and I wouldn’t mind putting my hand up for a certain retirement age if it comes to it.’

Lords Speaker Baroness D’Souza said a life peerage should not be a ‘life sentence’.

She told the programme: ‘One of the things I want to do is to try to create a culture where it is seen as a public duty to retire in order to allow fresh blood to come in.

‘In practice it [the increasing number of peers] means the chamber is very crowded. At Question Time there are sometimes some rather unseemly fights… there is quite a lot of competition and a lot of resentment that builds out of that.’

The House of Lords has been forced to squeeze in a further 121 desks in the past five years to the offices it has in buildings around Parliament as it tries to accommodate all the peers.

Labour’s Lord Foulkes, who has called for the number of peers to be reduced to 450 and a retirement age of 80 to be introduced, said the situation had become a joke.

He said: ‘The Tory chief whip has been prowling the corridors to see where they can pack in more peers. People have come round with tape measures to see how big the offices are so they can work out if they can fit in another desk.

‘The chamber is near to overflowing. During Question Time it is more and more difficult to get in. The library is getting increasingly overstretched, it is getting harder to find a seat.’

David Cameron has been increasing the number of Tory peers so that the Lords replicates the political balance in the Commons.

Lord Foulkes said: ‘If Labour win [the next election] and want to do the same thing the numbers will shoot up again. It is a joke.’
