Up to 5,000 staff at electricals chain Comet could be out of a job just a week before Christmas after administrators today announced a further 125 stores will close.

Administrators Deloitte said it would only keep the remaining 70 stores open until all remaining stock is sold.

Deloitte confirmed it was still in talks
with a 'small number' of interested buyers, but said it was necessary 
to begin shutting shops in the absence of a firm offer for the whole 
business.

Deloitte is also proposing to close the company's distribution centre in Harlow, Essex, this Friday and will cut back office functions at Rickmansworth, Hull and Clevedon.

The distribution centre at Skelmersdale will continue to support the store network.

The announcement comes after hopes had been raised of a rescue deal after it emerged Southampton-based entrepreneur Clive Coombes was considering making a bid.

Joint-administrator Chris Farrington said: 'We remain in discussions with a small number of interested parties and hope that a positive outcome can still be achieved.

'Should any acceptable offers be received for stores we will delay the closure process.

'Unfortunately, in the absence of a firm offer for the whole of the business, it has become necessary to begin making plans in case a sale is not concluded.

'If a sale is not possible we would envisage stores to begin closing in December.'

Around 5,000 employees work across the 195 Comet stores, with more than 3,000 jobs expected to be affected by today's decision.

But it is understood that unless a buyer is found all stores will close before Christmas with all 5,000 employees losing their jobs.

Since Deloitte was appointed to work for the electricals chain, some 1,500 jobs have already been axed.

Farrington added: 'We remain extremely grateful to the Company’s employees for their commitment and support during a period of concern and anxiety for them. 

'All employees will be paid for the work they do while the Company is in administration and I can confirm that any accrued holiday pay, overtime and bonus earned during the Administration trading period, together with the pre-Administration bonus that was owed to employees at the time of our appointment, will be paid to employees as previously stated.

'A dedicated helpline is in place for all employees and the Company is running an Employee Assistance Programme to help those staff made redundant find other jobs.'

He added that Deloitte has contacted more than 35 prospective employers who are 'keen' to offer roles to ex-Comet employees.

The collapse of Comet marks one of the biggest high street casualties since the demise of Woolworths in 2008 and came a month after the failure of JJB Sports.

The group was hit by weak high street trading conditions, competition from online rivals and being unable to secure the trade credit insurance needed to safeguard suppliers.

In particular, it was knocked by the lack of first-time home-buyers, who had been key customers for Comet.
