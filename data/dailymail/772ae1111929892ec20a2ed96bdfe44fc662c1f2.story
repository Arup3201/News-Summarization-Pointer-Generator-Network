Ed Miliband is facing a growing revolt over this leadership, after his poll lead over the Tories evaporated and four in 10 voters branded him ‘weird’.

The Labour leader is under pressure from all sides in the party after a lacklustre response to the Budget and slumping to only one point above the Conservatives in three different opinion polls.

One MP called for Mr Miliband to stop ‘just talking about the state’, while a group of left-wing think tanks urged him to explain what he would actually do if he became Prime Minister.

Some 41 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband is 'weird', compared to only 27 per cent who thought the same of David Cameron

The Labour lead over the Conservatives has narrowed dramatically in recent days, and is down to just one point in three different polls, including this one from YouGov for the Sunday Times

A string of MPs and influential party thinkers say he needs ‘bolder’ ideas and cannot try to coast to victory complaining about the cost of living.

Members of the Shadow Cabinet told the Mail that his top team is split over whether to ‘go big or go small’ to woo voters over the next year.

Allies of policy chief Jon Cruddas broke cover yesterday to demand he ‘goes big’ with a more radical set of policies.

They believe general election coordinator Douglas Alexander is encouraging Mr Miliband to be more cautious, in the belief that winning 35 per cent of the vote next year will be enough for victory.

In further dispiriting news for the Labour chief, a survey revealed that voters think he is the ‘weirdest’ party leader in Britain.

The YouGov poll for BuzzFeed showed that 41 per cent think Mr Miliband is either ‘very weird’ or ‘somewhat weird’.

Just 34 per cent thinks the same of Nick Clegg and only 27 per cent believe that David Cameron is weird.

The survey, which looked at the public’s perception of the leaders’ personalities, also found 36 per cent of the population believe Mr Miliband would have been bullied at school.

A third also think he would have been an unpopular student and 57 per cent said he would have been the hardest-working pupil.

But the more pressing concern for Labour MPs is that another YouGov opinion poll put the Tories on 36 points, just one point behind Labour, while a Survation poll had the Conservatives on 34 points – also only one point behind.

Yesterday a Populus poll put Labour on 35 per cent, again only one point ahead of the Tories on 34 per cent.

Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls are still trailing far behind the Conservatives when voters were asked which party they trust to run the economy.

A senior Labour frontbencher said: ‘Our economic offering was already seen as weak by some voters. Ed’s lame response has not helped with that.

‘Some people seem to think that we can just coast to victory. This poll should be a wake-up call.’

And a member of the Shadow Cabinet described the ‘pretty intense debate’ with those wanting to think big calling for a ‘distinctive, more radical platform for voters’.

He added: ‘And if we win we will have a firmer platform to tackle the problems Ed has identified with predator capitalism. You can either have a mandate to do something interesting or you can try to creep over the line not offending anyone.’

Responding to last week’s Budget, Mr Miliband recycled several tired attacks on the Tories, accusing them of being ‘out of touch’ members of the ‘Bullingdon Club’ with little idea of how normal people are affected by cuts.

But a Labour MP said: ‘People just don’t take any notice of all the posh Tory boy attacks. They want to know what we are actually going to do.’

An alliance of think-tanks and Left-wing intellectuals provided a fresh blow to the Labour leader, writing a joint letter to Mr Miliband questioning his sense of direction.

The 19 leading figures from groups such as Fabian Society, Compass, Policy Network and Progress expressed unease that Labour’s leader may not secure a mandate for the kind of reforms they believe Britain needs.

They argued that Britain needs ‘transformative’ change, adding: ‘If Labour plays the next election safe and hopes to win on the basis of Tory unpopularity, it will not have earned a mandate for such change.’

Neal Lawson, of the think-tank Compass, said Labour needed to ‘shape up, be bolder and more radical’.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk warned Mr Miliband had to be ‘much stronger’ when communicating his message to voters.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour: ‘We have to talk less to ourselves and more to the wider public.

‘We're sometimes seen as just talking about the public sector, just talking about the state.

‘I think we need to cut the soundbites and really talk more about small business, about entrepreneurialism, about people's aspirations there, because...  the general election will be very much about the economy and as a party we need to get onto the front-foot talking about how we can support some small businesses, not least because they are the backbone of the return to the successful economy.’

Another radical accused Mr Miliband of being on the back foot after George Osborne’s plans to overhaul pensions.

Even an ally admitted that cost of living issues will not be enough to win a majority in 2015 as wages will begin to overtake prices later this year.

Labour sought to downplay the polls, saying the Tories were ‘always going to get a bounce out of the Budget’.

A survey by ComRes last night put Labour five points ahead of the Tories on 36 per cent, although the party’s lead has  shrunk by eight points.

Mr Miliband faces a fresh headache this week when around 15 of his MPs are expected to defy his instructions to vote for the Government’s welfare cap.
