Wigan coach Shaun Wane has revealed he will recall Ben Flower to his struggling Super League team as soon as his six-month ban is up.

The Wales international prop forward is a fortnight away from completing the second longest suspension in the history of Super League, imposed last October for twice punching St Helens half-back Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of the Grand Final at Old Trafford.

After missing two pre-season trials, Wigan's World Club Series clash with Brisbane Broncos and the first 10 games of the league campaign, Flower will be free to make his return in the Super League derby with Warrington at the DW Stadium on Thursday April 11.

Wigan coach Shaun Wane says Flower will return for his struggling team once his ban comes to an end

Wane has a policy of re-introducing players through partner club Workington following lengthy lay-offs, but says his hand has been forced by his team's disappointing start to the season and the shortage of front-row options.

Dom Crosby and Ryan Sutton are currently injured, leaving Lee Mossop as the Warriors' only specialist prop, and Wane has been forced to use utility forwards Tony Clubb, Larne Patrick and Taulima Tautai as front-row options.

'It would have been hard to drop one of our middles if we had won every game but, as it stands now, it's not that hard,' Wane said.

'I've looked at him in training and he's ready to go. I wouldn't have thrown him in straight away had things panned out differently. It's definitely dictated the way we've approached things with him over the last couple of months.'

Flower, who missed out on the club's pre-season trip to the United States, underwent knee surgery during his enforced absence and has stepped up his training under head conditioner Mark Bitcon.

'He's fit,' Wane said. 'Mark Bitcon has done a great job with him. His knee is good so everything he had done is spot on.

'I'm confident I can put him back in. I just need to put three middles on the bench and that will cover him.'
