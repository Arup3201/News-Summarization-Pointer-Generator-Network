Two suspects have been arrested in the shooting death of a one-year-old boy who was allegedly killed by accident when they were aiming for his father.

Dequan Breland and Dequan Wright were arrested on Friday, five days after they reportedly shot and killed Antiq Hennis.

Antiq was being pushed across a Brooklyn street on Sunday by his father Anthony, who is believed to be a member of the notorious Crips gang.

Police believe that the shooting was related to a disagreement between the suspects and Anthony Hennis, 21, though the exact argument in question still has not been revealed.

Suspects: Dequan Breland (left) and Dequan Wright (right) were taken into police custody in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on Friday in connection to a shooting in Brooklyn, New York on Sunday

Victim: Antiq Hennis was being pushed across a road in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Brooklyn by his parents at about 7.20pm yesterday when he was shot

According to The New York Post, Breland, 23, and Wright, 19, were discovered in an apartment that belongs to Breland's cousin in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

'They knocked on the door and the occupants refused to open it,' NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly said in a press conference on Friday.

'The officers breached the door to gain entry. In the rear bedroom they found Dequan Breland on the floor and Dequan Wright lying on the bed.'

One witness has identified Breland as the shooter, and said that Wright was the one to hand him the gun just moments before Breland fired four shots.

Connected: A witness saw Wright, 19, hand the gun to Breland on Sunday night

Pulling the trigger: Breland then reportedly fired four shots, one of which hit the 1-year-old boy

Mr Kelly spoke out about the shooting on Sunday, saying that Anthony Hennis- who has an extensive criminal history- was now cooperating with investigators.

'He has not been cooperative with us. He has not answered questions. We're still trying to obviously determine his contacts — and he has an extensive arrest record so we are looking into his relationships,' he said.

Cops have issued a $12,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the boy’s killer.

Shocking: One-year-old Antiq Hennis was shot in this stroller in an impoverished area of Brooklyn last night

Pay respects: Mourners visit a memorial for Antiq Hennis in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn, New York, where the one-year-old boy was shot and killed in his stroller during a walk with his parents on Sunday

Innocent: Antiq Hennis was in a stroller being walked by his father when he was struck in the head by gunfire - the bullet was said to be meant for his dad

The family lives in Brooklyn's notorious Brownsville neighborhood, which has one of the highest concentrations of public housing anywhere in the U.S.

Eye witness Gina Gamboa, 22, told the New York Daily News: '[The father] was screaming "My baby got shot". He was going crazy.'

'The baby was breathing, but his eyes were closed. It’s crazy. They just will start shooting.

'The baby’s chest was moving, but his head was tilted to the side. There was blood all over the stroller.’
