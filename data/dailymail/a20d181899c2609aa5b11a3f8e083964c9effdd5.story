A mother who suffered a stroke - leaving her paralysed and unable to talk - was cured within two hours after undergoing pioneering treatment.

Jacqueline Keeley was rushed to Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital for an operation, in which the blood clot which caused the stroke was scooped out by a tube containing a tiny mesh basket.

The tube was fed through her groin and into her brain with X-ray guidance.

The 65-year-old said the 'amazing' 
procedure - which immediately restored her speech and movement - had 
made her life worth living again.

'I
thought I would be unable to speak or move for the rest of my life but I
was back to normal again just a few hours after the attack,' Jacqueline
said.

'It was amazing.'

Jacqueline suffered a stroke at her home in Kings Norton, Birmingham, in February. She was initially given Alteplase, a drug which contains a protein that breaks down blood clots.

But, when that didn’t work, the medics mentioned the thrombectomy option.

'I was awake on the operating table when they performed the procedure,' she said.

'I couldn’t feel a thing and couldn’t speak. When the basket got near the brain I heard an explosion, it almost felt like fireworks in my head.

'I couldn’t tell them what I thought because I had no voice. Then seconds later it happened again. I must have winced and when the doctors asked if I was OK, I actually spoke and said ‘yes’. I couldn’t believe it.

'Then I said: ‘Oh I can talk’. It was because, at that split second, they caught the blood clot which was causing the blockage.'

Jacqueline’s grateful daughter, Michelle Hart, who works for West Midlands Police, later raised £2,000 for the Stroke Association by doing a skydive.

The QE is among only a handful of centres in the UK to perform the procedure. It was first performed there in April last year and so far been used on five patients.

Stroke consultant Dr Don Sims said the new procedure could make a huge difference to some stroke patients.

'It is very new so research will continue to see how many people will be able to benefit from this in the future,' he said.
