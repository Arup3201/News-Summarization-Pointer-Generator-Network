Sir Bob Geldof swore twice at critics of his new Band Aid 30 single - dismissing their comments as 'complete b******s' on live TV.

The Band Aid organiser, whose latest version of Do They Know It's Christmas? has already topped the iTunes singles chart, made the remark during an interview today.

The 63-year-old was pulled off air after he ignored two warnings over his use of 'colourful' language when speaking out against his detractors.

Sir Bob spoke out after a Sky News reporter asked him for his views on claims that the song's star-studded lineup could raise money by paying their taxes 'in the right way'.

Jayne Secker said: 'A lot of detractors are saying, look at a lot of those people in that room, a lot of wealthy people, if they all paid their taxes in the right way, we wouldn't need these kinds of fundraising singles.'

When asked for his comments, Geldof said: 'I think they are all talking b******s'.

Ms Secker then asked what his response was to comments made by journalist Ian Burrell, who called the song 'trite' and 'patronising' and said that it would raise 'comparative pittance' for charity.

Geldof responded: 'Complete load of b******s'. 

The interview was then cut off as Ms Secker had twice warned him about his 'colourful' language after his first outburst.

It comes after he announced this morning that Do They Know It's Christmas? had raised more than £1million within minutes of its TV premiere last night. 

This morning, Geldof said that sales had 'gone manic' after the new version of Do They Know It's Christmas? was played for the first time on the X Factor. 

Stars including Bono, Chris Martin and One Direction were among the artists who gathered to record a reworked version of the hit charity single in response to the Ebola crisis. 

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Geldof said: 'It's gone manic. That's the digital age.

'We promoted the single on X Factor, Simon Cowell gave us five minutes of the show last night. Within four or five minutes of leaving the show we had a million quid. That's extraordinary.

'From what we're seeing now from iTunes it's gone bonkers. The pre-orders of the thing were ridiculous.' 

As soon as the song premiered on X Factor, it became the most trending topic on Twitter worldwide - with users using #BandAid30 to share their thoughts.  

Standing ovation: X Factor judges Louis Walsh, Mel B, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Simon Cowell stood up to applaud the song's premiere. Within five minutes of leaving the show, the song had raised £1million

Premiere: A clip from the video showed U2 frontman Bono in the recording studio. The new track marks the 30th anniversary of the song, which was originally put together to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia

The £1million was raised through a combination of pre-sales on iTunes and text donations. On the show, viewers were told they could text AID to 70060 to give £5. 

Chancellor George Osborne has agreed to waive VAT on the single's sales, to focus proceeds on the charity effort, and iTunes said it is waiving its fees. 

The new recording of Do They Know It's Christmas marks the 30th anniversary of the song, which was originally put together to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. 

The new Band Aid line-up includes 11 musicians who have never had a UK number one single – a stark contrast to the original group that included members of Bananarama, Duran Duran and Status Quo.

The new cohort does have 28 number ones between them, but half of these come from veteran stars Bono, 54, Midge Ure, 61, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, 65, and Sir Bob, 63.

Members of the bands Bastille, Elbow and Underworld, as well as artists including Emeli Sande, 27, Paloma Faith, 33, and Jessie Ware, 30, are all taking part despite having never had a single top the UK charts.

The new Band Aid 30 single is already at the top of the iTunes chart, after being released this morning

However, their luck might be about to change – as the power of the internet has allowed Do They Know It's Christmas? to climb the charts three weeks before it is even released. 

So many fans have pre-ordered a copy on Amazon that it has shot to second on the shopping website's list of most purchased singles. 

And while detailed sales figures are not expected to be available until later in the week, the track is likely to top the charts at the weekend. It has become the bookies' favourite to clinch the Christmas number one. 

If it does take the number one spot this weekend, it will knock the official BBC Children In Need single, sung by Gareth Malone's All Star Choir, from the top of the UK charts. 

It's not only the line-up that has changed since Band Aid first released Do They Know It's Christmas? in 1984. The lyrics have also been altered to reflect the ebola crisis. 

The original line 'Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears' has been replaced with 'Where a kiss of love can kill you and there's death in every tear'. 

Speaking today, Geldof said that further international versions are also to be recorded. 

He continued: 'The Germans go into bat today, I have asked the Germans to do the German version and I have asked Carla Bruni to do it in France, to translate it into French, so they're going next.' 

Geldof has called the track 'a little bit of pop history' and said it delivered a powerful message about the urgent need to fight the virus, estimated to have killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa. 

He was also critical today about the response from some national governments. 

Future hit: Detailed sales figures are not expected to be available until later this week but the track is likely to top the charts at the weekend and is the bookies' favourite for Christmas No. 1. Above, Rita Ora in the video

International push: Versions of the song are also to be recorded in Germany and France, Sir Bob Geldof said today. Above, singer Ed Sheeran performs in the music video that was played on X Factor last night

He continued: ''The Germans aren't doing enough, frankly. Obviously the French have sent their troops to help in Guinea and of course the British, the squaddies are down in Sierra Leone.'

'The Germans are the most powerful economy in Europe. They are laggards and they shouldn't be.

'It's as dangerous for them as it is for us. This thing is a flight away from us.' 

The latest version of Do They Know It's Christmas, released today, has already raised more than £1million and is set to top the charts. 

If it does, it will become the fourth time the charity record has taken the number one spot. 

The original recording, which featured Bono, George Michael, Paul Weller, Boy George and Simon le Bon, was the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK when it was first released.

It led to the successful Live Aid concerts in 1985, which raised around £150million for the fight against famine in Ethiopia.

Since then, there have been two further charity recordings of the same track, Band Aid II in 1989 and Band Aid 20 in 2004, both of which also topped the charts.

Band Aid II included contributions from Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue, Bananarama and Sir Cliff Richard among others, while Band Aid 20 featured Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Sir Paul McCartney and Dizzee Rascal

The 2004 version raised money for famine relief in the war ravaged Sudanese region of Darfur.

Although it also reached Number 1, it sold just over one million copies, compared with the 3.5million sold by the original hit.

Band Aid 20 was also criticised by the World Development Movement, which said many of the song lyrics were ‘patronising, false and out of date’. 

Sir Bob Geldof said he was spurred to mobilise today’s pop stars after seeing a brave nurse wipe away a tear from the cheek of a child dying of ebola. 

‘The nurse forgot where she was, and what was happening, and wiped a tear from the child,’ said Sir Bob. ‘The child died and the nurse died. You can’t get more tragic than that.’

After this, Sir Bob – once disinclined to revisit Do They Know It’s Christmas after 30 years – was now utterly convinced of the need for a new version of the song.

Fixed in his mind, as he rewrote some of the lyrics to the song with producer Midge Ure, was the image of the nurse wiping away the child’s tear. 

Now the line ‘Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears’ is replaced with ‘Where a kiss of love can kill you and there’s death in every tear’.
