Ronny Deila has been accused of being an idealistic manager of Celtic. Pressed on what it might take to keep John Guidetti on a permanent basis, however, he became a hard-headed pragmatist.

‘Money is always a key factor,’ said the Norwegian bluntly.

‘We will see what happens, but everyone has to know we really want John to stay. I’ve talked with him and he loves being here. He loves the club and we need to do everything we can now to make his move a permanent one.’

Swedish striker John Guidetti is on a season-loan at Celtic from Premier League champions Manchester City

Saying it is the easy part. Putting together a deal which might make Guidetti commit himself to a Scottish footballing landscape in financial decline is a trickier business.

With eight goals in eight games - including Wednesday night’s hat-trick against Partick Thistle in the League Cup - the striker has told anyone who will listen that he is honoured to be at Celtic and enjoying his football for the first time since a successful loan year at Feyenoord.

Whether that translates to a permanent transfer is another story. Guidetti is believed to earn around £40,000 a week at Manchester City - significantly more than the highest-paid player at Celtic.

There are parallels with the capture of Joe Ledley from Cardiff City.

Like the Welshman before him back in 2010, the fact that Guidetti turns 23 this season means he could join Celtic on a cross-border Bosman when his City contract lapses next summer without the need for compensation. English clubs, in contrast, would be obliged to pay Manchester City a development fee for his services.

The main question, then, revolves around wages. And Deila is hopeful that the sway of rebuilding an injury-plagued career with Celtic can outweigh financial considerations when it comes time to reach a decision.

Asked what a player faced with a choice of £25,000 a week at Parkhead or £40,000 a week at a middling English Premier League club should do, the Norwegian was blunt.

‘The decision is very easy. You stay at Celtic,’ said Deila.

‘It’s also important to know that Celtic, if you take away the money, is still one of the biggest clubs in the world.

‘If you come here you have everything. You have stadium, supporters, fantastic pitches, good staff, history, and you have European football.

‘Here you have what you need to get to your potential.’

During his time in charge at Stromsgodset in his native land, Deila signed players previously considered unobtainable by convincing them that a step backwards could bring two forward at a later date. He will try the same pitch with Guidetti.

‘John loves football. Money is important but that comes because of good performances,’ said the Celtic boss.

‘The best players always think: “Football, development, then the money comes as a consequence.”

‘I’ve seen it the other way around many times before. And it finishes very quick.

‘You can see the people that really want to learn and develop. You can see it in their attitude. Those are the kind of players that we want at Celtic. They will get the money also.’

Deila has already spoken to Guidetti about the possibility to staying on. For his part, the player says he has no desire to lose his focus and form by thinking of the future too soon.

Guidetti's City contract expires in the summer, so Celtic could sign him on a Bosman

‘I want to give 100 per cent every game for Celtic,’ said the Swede after Wednesday night’s game. ‘When my agent comes to me and says: “Okay , John, this is what’s going to happen,” then I listen.’

Agreeing with those sentiments, Deila said: ‘He was happy. But it’s important that he keeps focused on playing football. It’s easy to lose focus and to think of other things. It had to happen with the agent and the club and we need to concentrate on performing every week.

‘We have good contact with them [his agent] as well.

‘He had been injured for a long time and there was a question mark over that.

‘But now things are going well and we hope we can keep him here. It is perfect for the club and the way we want to play.

Deila said Celtic is the perfect place for Guidetti to get his career back on track after a string of injuries

‘Manchester City cannot sell him to another club in January because we have him on loan for the season. So I don’t think that is possible. We have a good relationship with City and we talk to them a lot.’

Asked if Celtic can afford Guidetti’s wages, Deila conceded the need for goodwill and compromise if the player is to remain on the books at Parkhead.

‘I think he has to go into our economy. I think that’s possible.

‘It’s important that he is performing well here and that he feels loved and wanted. To play at Celtic when that happens, you can’t be in a better place.

‘I’ve said to John that he needs stability to play.

‘He is a very good football player and he has started very well for us. He has a lot of potential and he still has a long way to go.

‘He is enjoying every minute here and he is wanted here. He is also loved here. It’s also important that he is not just giving something to us, but we are giving something to him.

‘I think he sees that he is performing well now because the team are performing, too. Those things are important when young players are picking the next stage of their career and the next club.’
