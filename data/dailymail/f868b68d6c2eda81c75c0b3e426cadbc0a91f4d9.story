Dr Peter Rubin arrives at the hearing in Manchester today. It is alleged he slept with a patient in his consultation room before prescribing her the morning-after pill

A GP had sex with a patient in his consultation room before prescribing her the morning after pill, a tribunal heard today.

Dr Peter Rubin invited the woman to the Woodlands Medical Centre, in Didcot, Oxfordshire, for 'non-clinical reasons', it is said.

The pair had intercourse in the surgery on Christmas Eve 2007 before Dr Rubin told her: 'You had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic.'

The GP continued to send the woman - referred to as Patient A -
personal text messages for the next five years.

She made a complaint when Dr Rubin forcibly tried 
to remove her trousers and stared at her underwear during a consultation
 in July 2012, it is alleged.

The
 shamed medic then begged Patient A to withdraw the complaint for the 'sake of
 his child', the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard.

Dr
 Rubin is accused of misconduct at the fitness to practise hearing in 
Manchester where he has admitted the relationship, but disputes some of 
the patient's claims.

He has
 also confessed to asking a 21-year-old university student, referred to 
as Patient B, to kiss him on the cheek after prescribing her the 
contraceptive pill.

The General Medical Council (GMC) allege his actions were sexually motivated, but Dr Rubin claims it was just his 'sense of humour'.

The
 GP, who was suspended in November 2012 and left the practice the 
following month, could face being struck off the medical register. The hearing continues.

The hearing was told how Dr Rubin bought Patient A a pricey Prada mobile
 phone, treated her children to a Wii console and took her out for lunch
 in Reading, Berkshire.

Craig Sephton QC, opening the case for the GMC, said: 'On August 30, 2007, it was the day before Patient A's birthday, a parcel arrived unexpectedly at her home address and when she opened it, it was found to contain a Prada mobile phone, sim card and an unsigned birthday card.

'Unfortunately Patient A suffered a road traffic accident that very day and went to the GP surgery the next day where she saw Dr Rubin.

'Dr Rubin gave her a hug and in the course of the consultation he said 'Why is it that none of my patients wear nice underwear?'

'Patient A asked about the Prada phone and Dr Rubin said it was one of the most expensive on the market, but would not admit that he sent it at that stage.'

The pair exchanged phone numbers and the medic began to send 'texts and photographs of an intimate nature,' the hearing was told.

Several months later the woman brought her son to the surgery for blood tests and Dr Rubin asked what he wanted as a reward 'for being so brave', the panel heard.

The boy said he wanted a Wii console and the medic brought the present around to her house just before Christmas.

'He arranged with Patient A that they would meet for lunch in Reading and he would pay for lunch,' said Mr Sephton.

Dr Rubin is said to have prescribed the woman the contraception before saying: 'You had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic'

'Dr Rubin told Patient A he was getting her a Christmas present and she decided she should get him a present and she went to the surgery on Christmas Eve,' he added.

'After the staff had gone home on Christmas Eve Dr Rubin and Patient A stayed behind in the surgery and there sexual intercourse took place.

'Dr Rubin gave Patient A a prescription for an antibiotic for a sore throat as she was supposed to be going to a carol concert and had to explain why she was late.

'This was a pretext. Of course she had no sore throat. He also gave her a prescription for the morning after pill and said 'you had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic'.'

The GMC say he later tried to conceal his motive behind giving her the medication when he added a false entry to her records saying it had been 'added by mistake'.

'The relationship between Patient A and Dr Rubin developed. He continued to send texts and photos of a personal nature,' Mr Sephton said.

'He visited her house during working hours and had intimate contact with her, meaning he fondled her,' he added.

'Patient A felt uncomfortable about the relationship from the start and put a stop to it. However, Dr Rubin continued to send texts on an occasional basis, again something he has admitted.'

But the GP denies that he acted inappropriately during a consultation in July 2012 after Patient A fell off a horse.

Mr Sephton said: 'She will tell you Dr Rubin tried to pull her trousers down while she was fighting to keep them up. He was telling her he wanted to check her groin although she could not see why.

'She will tell you he was staring at her underwear, her knickers.'

He added: 'Eventually Patient A confided in one of the doctor's partners about what had happened and an investigation was started.

'Dr Rubin phoned Patient A and begged her to withdraw her complaint if not for his sake then for the sake of his child.

'This was a dishonest attempt to gag Patient A from making her complaint.'

The hearing, which is expected to last for seven days, continues.
