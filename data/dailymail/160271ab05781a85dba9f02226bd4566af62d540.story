Tragic: 16-year-old Ben Morutare died from a stab wound to the leg after being attacked outside a party in Smethwick, West Midlands

A 16-year-old boy who died after being stabbed in the leg outside a birthday party has been named as Ben Morutare.

It is believed the teenager from Walsall, West Midlands, who was known as 'Lil' Ben', died as he tried to protect a friend who was being attacked in nearby Smethwick on Friday night.

A brawl reportedly broke out between two groups and police were called to the disturbance at Smethwick Home Guard and Old Comrades Club just before 1.30am.

A witness said: 'A crowd of about 30 people attacked the boy who died. He had been defending his mate who was getting kicked on the ground by the gang. It's just so sad he died like that.'

The boy was found injured after receiving a stab wound to the leg and taken to Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where he later died.

A tribute site has now been set up on Facebook. Commenting on the page, Liam Jones said: 'Got big respect for this lad - he saved me from being jumped. R.I.P. my heart goes out to you and your family.'

A murder inquiry has now been opened into by West Midlands Police.

Detective
Inspector Gary Plant, from the force's CID said: 'We do not underestimate the devastating impact the death of this young man will have on his family and the local community.

'We will do everything within our power to establish how Ben died and officers continue to conduct house-to-house enquiries and part of the area around the club is still currently cordoned off.

The 16-year-old is believed to have attended a female friend's party in nearby Smethwick on Friday night

'I would like to thank the local 
community for their patience and support as we continue with our 
investigations and would urge anyone who can help us with any 
information to speak to us at their earliest opportunity.

'My officers and family liaison 
officers have been speaking to Ben’s family and continue to offer them 
support and our thoughts and condolences remain with them at this time.'

Bapinder Singh, 25, who was playing poker
in a side room of the club on Friday night, said: 'It was a girl's 17th
and a boy's 18th joint party.

'I went outside for a cigarette at about 12.30am and there was about 250-300 young people at the party at that time.

'I didn't see what happened but a fight broke out at 1am after the bouncer left and it all kicked off after that.

'We were held there in the side room until we were allowed to leave at about 3.30am.'
