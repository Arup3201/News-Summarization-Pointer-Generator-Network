A drug dealer who was jailed for 18 years when his cocaine smuggling enterprise was uncovered has suffered even more embarrassment after his Rolls-Royce was put on public display.

George Evans's luxury vehicle was displayed by police with the words 'This used to be a drug dealer’s car, now it’s ours' emblazoned on its window before being auctioned off.

The 6.3 litre Silver Sprint will be now be sold, with proceeds used to fund crime prevention projects, after the 76-year-old's was told to repay £500,000 from his criminal enterprise.

Jailed: George Evans and his wife Anne were ordered to pay back £500,000 in court last year after he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for cocaine smuggling and she was jailed for 18 months for money laundering

Up for sale: The drug dealer's Rolls Royce is now being displayed around Bedfordshire before being sold off to duns crime prevention programmes

The drug dealer was jailed last year for smuggling huge amounts of the Class A drug into Britain.

Evans's wife Anne, 55, was only imprisoned for 18 months after she was found guilty of money laundering.

Now police are selling off the couple's assets, including their £400,000 home, to recuperate proceeds from the criminal activity, which will be given to Bedfordshire Police.

After seizing the couple's house, car and money, police handed out personal safety devices in Biggleswade today.

The car will tour around the county before being sold off.

Chief Inspector Shane Roberts said: 'Both big and small time criminals alike need to understand that with prosecution will come the loss of their ill-gotten gains'

Chief Inspector Shane Roberts who led 
Operation Droxford, the investigation into George and Anne Evans, said: 'It is 
inconceivable in my mind that criminals should ever be able to leave the
justice system still in possession of the proceeds from their crimes.

'It sends out the wrong message. The only message criminals need to 
understand is that our teams will relentlessly pursue you until we have 
identified and confiscated everything you have.

'In Evans case it’s their
money, cars and house.

'Both big and small time criminals alike need to understand that with prosecution will come the loss of their ill-gotten gains.'
