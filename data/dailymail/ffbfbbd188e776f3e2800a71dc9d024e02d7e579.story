Darren Fletcher has hailed former Manchester United team-mate Park Ji-Sung as a 'big-game player' following his retirement from football.

The South Korean played his last professional match on Friday in the K League All-Star Game, scoring in the goal-fest 6-6 draw.

The 33-year-old was given a heroes reception in front of over 50,000 fans at the Seoul World Cup stadium, collecting the man-of-the-match award in the process as he ended his career on a high.

Mr dependable: Fletcher described Park as a 'big-game player' during his time at Manchester United

Park enjoyed a trophy-laden seven-year spell at Old Trafford winning four Premier League titles, three League Cups, one UEFA Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup in 205 appearances for the club.

The midfielder's energetic displays endeared him to the Red Devils faithful and his team-mates alike with Fletcher quick to praise Park for his performances in a Manchester United shirt.

'I remember him as a big-game player,' the Scotland international told manutd.com.

'When the big games came around, against the likes of Arsenal and the big Champions League sides, he always stepped up to the plate. He was a great team-mate and a real humble lad in the dressing room. He just went about his job diligently.

'For such a big star in Asia – and he really is a superstar there – he never acted that way at all. He was always professional and a great player. I’d say he was an underrated player, too. People talk about his work-rate but technically he was very good as well.

'He could use his left and his right foot, he received the ball very well, he was strong and was the ultimate team player.

'He would sacrifice himself for the greater good of the team. The more players you have on your side like Ji-sung Park the more chance you have of being successful.'
