Terry showed off his sportsman's physique in a fitted sky blue shirt as he lapped up the lively atmosphere.

His wife opted for a stunning red form-fitting layered mini-dress, which showed off her enviably long and lean legs.

She brought the frilly number at the waist with a black belt, further accentuating her svelte body.

Toni Terry grinned as she chatted with pals while they waited to be driven off at the end of the night

The Chelsea captain Terry also looked to be in jovial spirits as he sat alongside pals in the vehicle

With her dark tresses cascading well beyond her shoulders, the stunner added extra length to her legs with a pair of black strappy open-toe heels.

She clutched a leather Chanel handbag as she held her husband's hand while they exited the club in the early hours of Saturday morning.

And the night appeared to be one to remember, as the couple were all smiles while bundling into a waiting car after their night on the town.
