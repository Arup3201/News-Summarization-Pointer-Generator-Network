Real Madrid suffered a 2-1 defeat against Fiorentina in their final pre-season match before their Copa del Rey showdown with rivals Atletico Madrid.

Carlo Ancelotti named a relatively strong starting line-up for the match which took place in Warsaw - with the likes of James Rodriguez, Xabi Alonso and Sami Khedira lining up alongside Ronaldo.

The La Liga giants took the lead after just four minutes when Cristiano Ronaldo picked the ball up in his own half before laying it onto team-mate Angel di Maria.

Di Maria, who has been linked with a move away from the Santiago Bernabeu, then played the ball back to Ronaldo who slotted past the helpless Norberto Neto.

The European champions were pegged back in the 27th minute when Mario Gomez scored a diving header past Real Madrid new boy Keylor Navas.

Fiorentina's winning goal came from an unlikely source as left-back Marcos Alonso, who was on loan at Sunderland last season, grabbed the final goal of the game.
