Christina Rees, 60, has been selected to follow her ex-husband's footsteps to the House of Commons

The ex-wife of disgraced former Cabinet Minister Ron Davies will stand as a Labour MP - after divorcing him over his 'moment of madness' in a gay sex haunt.

Christina Rees, 60, was selected to follow her ex-husband's footsteps to the House of Commons after beating the daughter of comedienne Tracey Ullman for a safe Labour seat.

Christina was married to Mr Davies for 18 years - but parted after he resigned from the Blair government after his 'moment of madness' with a male stranger at Clapham Common.

Mr Davies was the first major scandal of the Blair Government - stepping down as Welsh Secretary in 1998 after the incident when he was robbed at knifepoint after talking to a man he had never met before on the common.

Mr Davies was divorced from his wife Christina in December 2000 and later quit as an MP.

Ms Rees was selected to run as the party's parliamentary candidate in Neath, South Wales,

She beat Mabel McKeown - the daughter of US-based comedian Tracey Ullman.

Ms Rees is a Labour councillor and works for Squash Wales as a development officer and a national coach.

She is taking over from former Northern Ireland minister Peter Hain who is retiring.

Ms Rees said: 'Now is the time for unity in Neath. We have got to get out on the campaign trial as soon as possible and make sure that Labour wins Neath again.

'Neath is a vibrant town with lots of ideas. I will represent the interests of the people of Neath to the best of my ability.'

Current Neath MP Peter Hain said: 'I'd like to offer my warmest congratulations to Christina Rees who beat a strong list of candidates to win the Labour nomination.

'Christina is a proven campaigner and I am sure will work hard to win the constituency for Labour.

'It is absolutely vital we make the case to the people of Neath of the need to stop the attacks of another Tory-led government and its destructive cuts, I am sure Chris is up to the challenge.'

Ms Rees split from the former Welsh Secretary Ron Davies (right) after he admitted he was bisexual after being robbed on Clapham Common in 1998

Mr Davies resigned after the incident - telling MPs he had been the victim of a frightening and shocking crime

Mr Davies - who admitted he had committed a 'grievous error of judgment' - was MP for Caerphilly but stood down after the scandal.

He later admitted he was bisexual and had psychiatric treatment to curb a 'compulsive' quest for risk. He has since remarried.
