An animal lover has saved the life of his pet fish with emergency first aid after its tank was smashed by a burglar.

Brian Craze, 52, discovered the rare tropical fish barely alive in less than an inch of water following the break-in at his home in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

He started to gently massage his beloved pet's body, before lowering it into another tank.

Alive: Mr Craze discovered the fish barely alive in less than an inch of water following the break-in at his home, and started to massage the animal's body before lowering it into another tank

Broken: Fifty other fish died when burglar Jason Hibberd, 34, smashed Mr Craze's £2,500 tank (pictured)

The Clown Loach, worth £40, initially floated on the surface of the water, but a minute later, it suddenly flipped its tail and started to swim.

Fifty other fish died when Mr Craze's £2,500 tank was smashed by burglar Jason Hibberd. 

Mr Craze, who has collected tropical fish for more than 30 years, said he was 'shocked' to find one of his precious pets still alive.

“I thought they were all dead but I could see one of the fish was just barely breathing,' he said.

'I gently picked it up and gave it some first aid by massaging its body.

'I then put it in another tank and it started to sink to the bottom so I thought he’d had it like the rest of them.

'But after a few minutes, it started to get enough oxygen from the water and it came back to life.'

During the break-in, Hibberd, 34, broke two televisions, smashed a window and slashed items of furniture.

Mess: Hibberd, who has an extensive criminal record, admitted burglary after being caught on Mr Craze's CCTV

Boarded up: Mr Craze believes the burglary was a personal attack on him out of spite

He then attacked the 6ft fish tank - killing 50 fish and sending water crashing over Mr Craze's belongings.

Gareth James, prosecuting, told Merthyr 
Crown Court: 'Mr Craze came home to find his £2,500 tank smashed and 50 
fish dead on the floor in an act of wanton vandalism.

'He feels it was a personal attack on him - Hibberd was not just there to burgle his home but to inflict as much damage as possible.'

Speaking outside court, Mr Craze added: 'All I was left with was the clothes I stood up in and just one fish. I know who did this and I believe it was a personal attack on me.'

Hibberd, who has an extensive criminal record, admitted burglary after being caught on Mr Craze's CCTV.

Sentencing him to seven years in jail, Judge Patrick Curran QC told him: 'You destroyed a tropical fish tank purely out of a sense of spite and vandalism.

'You smashed up televisions and other items and spoiled as much as you could.'
