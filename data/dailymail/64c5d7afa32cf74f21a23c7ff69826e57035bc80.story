Padraig Harrington held off a late challenge from Thailand's Thanyakon Khrongpha to win the Asian Tour's Indonesia Open by two shots on Sunday.

Ireland's triple major winner came through a stuttering start to the final round and then a thrilling 18th hole to card a winning total of 16-under-par 268.

The victory is Harrington's first at a full field tournament since he lifted the Johor Open title in 2010.

It was far from plain sailing for the world number 385, who had entered the final day with a four-shot lead before a poor start allowed Thanyakon to go two shots clear after nine holes.

A two-hour rain break seemed to stall the Thai's momentum, however, and Harrington fought back to restore parity with his rival heading to the 18th.

The Irishman skewed his tee shot to the edge of a hazard but Khrongpha failed to capitalise, finding the water with his second and registering a double-bogey six.

Harrington recovered his composure, sinking a 15-foot putt to make par and secure a dramatic victory.
