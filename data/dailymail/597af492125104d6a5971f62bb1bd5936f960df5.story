Barack Obama has cancelled a campaign event in Florida in order to return to Washington and oversee the response to Hurricane Sandy.

Mitt Romney has followed suit, pulling out of all campaigning on Monday evening and throughout Tuesday, along with his running mate Paul Ryan.

The President had been due to appear alongside Bill Clinton in Orlando this morning, but will instead take a lead in monitoring conditions on the East Coast as it is battered by the deadly storm.

He has also cancelled a planned appearance in Green Bay, Wisconsin on Tuesday, indicating officials believe the damage will continue throughout the week.

'Due to deteriorating weather 
conditions in the Washington area, the President will not attend today's
campaign event in Orlando,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a 
statement.

'The President will return to the White House to monitor the preparations for and early response to Hurricane Sandy.'

Obama arrived in Florida on Sunday night, coming early to try to beat the storm.

He was planning to appear with Clinton at the University of Central Florida, then move on to Ohio and northern Virginia.

Romney
intended to press on with campaign speeches in Ohio and Iowa today, but
announced he would cancel events planned for Monday evening and 
Tuesday.

Ryan has also cancelled plans to campaign in the same time frame, according to Republican officials.

Caution: Obama warned the public to remain alert during a press conference in the White House

The President held a brief press conference in the White House at lunchtime today, warning the public to pay attention to official warnings and praising the work of first responders who would be 'working 24/7 around the clock nonstop'.

'Don't pause, don't question the instructions you are given,' he said, adding that those who disobeyed the instructions of authorities would be 'putting first responders in danger'.

Despite the ravages of the 'big and powerful storm', Obama predicted that the nation would survive the disaster unscathed: 'We will clean up and we will get through this.'

He dismissed a reporter's question about how the hurricane will affect the election, saying: 'I'm not worried about the impact on the election... the election will take care of itself of itself next week.'

At a campaign event in Iowa, Michelle Obama said of her husband: 'He has made this storm his priority, and he is going to do whatever it 
takes to make sure the American people are safe and secure.'

Instead of campaigning with the President, Clinton headed to Connecticut to appear on behalf of congressman Chris Murphy, who is locked in a fierce battle for the state's vacant Senate seat.

He made reference to the hurricane, saying, 'We're coming down to the 11th hour. We're facing a violent storm.'

But Clinton then added: 'It's nothing compared to the storm we'll face if you don't make the right decision in this election.'

After the event in Waterbury, he flew with Vice President Joe Biden to Ohio, where the pair will make speeches to supporters in Youngstown.

Obama said yesterday that the heavily populated East Coast could face power failures and other disruptions for several days.

'Don't anticipate that just because the immediate storm has passed that we're not going to have some potential problems in a lot of these communities going forward through the week,' Obama said after a visit to the federal government's storm-response centre.

Romney re-routed his campaign from Virginia to join his vice-presidential running mate Paul Ryan in Ohio, one of the handful of battleground states that will decide the outcome of the November 6 election.

'You are the battleground of battlegrounds. You get to decide,' Ryan told a crowd of 1,000 people who were not able to join 2,000 others in a high school gymnasium in Celina, Ohio.

Both campaigns canceled events in New Hampshire, which could face high winds and heavy rain.

'The last thing the President and I 
want to do is get in the way of anything. The most important thing is 
people's safety and people's health,' Vice President Joe Biden told 
campaign volunteers in Manchester, New Hampshire, before leaving for 
Ohio.

Officials in the path
of the storm scrambled to ensure that extended power outages would not 
disrupt the early voting that appears to be critical for both candidates
this year.

Obama said he did not think the storm would impact voting, but some on his campaign staff were not so certain.

'Obviously we want unfettered access to the polls because we believe that the more people that come out, the better we'll do,' top Obama adviser David Axelrod said on CNN.

Republican Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell said his state plans to extend early voting hours and restore power quickly to election facilities in the event of outages.

Officials in neighboring Maryland said early voting stations would close on Monday. The looming storm threw another note of uncertainty into a race that remains a statistical dead heat.

The vast majority of voters have made up their minds at this point, and more than one in five have already cast their ballots.

But the storm could throw a wrench in the campaigns' efforts to drive voters to the polls in the final days before the election and will require them to ensure that their armies of door-knocking volunteers stay safe.

An extended power outage could sideline millions of dollars worth of television advertising that is set to saturate the airwaves in the final days of the race.

It also scrambles their efforts to schedule rallies in the handful of states that are likely to decide the outcome.

'The poll numbers aren't changing 
that much and I don't think the storm is going to change that dynamic. 
It's just going to present logistical challenges for the campaign,' 
Hunter College political science professor Jamie Chandler said.

A
severe disruption could hurt Obama more than Romney because his 
campaign has counted on early voting to lock up the support of those who
may be less likely to vote on Election Day, Chandler said.

Officials
from both campaigns said they were confident they would be able to get 
their message out and drive voters to the polls over the coming days. 
But they recognized that, after years of obsessive planning and nearly 
$2billion in campaign expenditures, the storm had introduced a 
last-minute element of chaos.

'There's
certain things we can't control and nature is one of them. We try to 
focus on the things that we can control,' Romney adviser Kevin Madden 
told reporters.

There is 
some evidence that natural disasters can hurt an incumbent's re-election
chances as voters often blame whoever is in office for adversity.

Research by Larry Bartels of 
Vanderbilt University and Christopher Achen of Princeton University 
found that Vice President Al Gore may have lost the election in 2000 
because of severe drought and excessive rainfall in seven states.

Bush's
approval ratings plummeted after Hurricane Katrina devastated New 
Orleans in 2005, and voters could similarly blame Obama if the 
government fumbles its response to this storm.

But there are also dangers for Romney, who will have to be careful to avoid being seen as politicising the disaster. His campaign's hasty response to the attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions in the Middle East in September was widely criticized.

The Obama campaign said it would suspend fundraising e-mails in the mid-Atlantic region on Monday and encouraged supporters to donate to the Red Cross.

Opinion polls show the race to be essentially tied at the national level.

A Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Sunday found Obama leading Romney among likely voters by 49 percent to 46 percent, within the online survey's credibility interval. Among all registered voters, Obama held a wider lead of 51 per cent to 39 per cent.

However, Obama retains a slim advantage in many of the battleground states that will decide the election.

A Washington Post poll released on Sunday found Obama leading Romney by 51 per cent to 47 per cent in Virginia, just outside the poll's margin of error.

In Ohio, a poll by a group of newspapers found the two tied at 49 per cent each. Other polls have shown Obama ahead there.

Romney received the endorsement of Iowa's largest newspaper, the Des Moines Register, which has not backed a Republican since 1972. He also won the endorsement of newspapers in Richmond and Cincinnati.

Obama won the endorsement of newspapers in Miami, Detroit and Toledo, Ohio, as well as The New York Times.
