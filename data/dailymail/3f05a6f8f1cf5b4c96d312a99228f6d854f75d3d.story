A council has sent out leaflets telling locals to ‘take a shopping list’ when they go out to buy food - and to put their purchases in the fridge or cupboard.

Watford Borough Council sent out the guide - called Your Guide to Reducing Food Waste - to more than 30,000 locals.

Some people in the town in Hertfordshire described it as ‘incredible’, while others said they thought it was a ‘prank’.

'It's as easy as 1, 2, 3': Watford Borough Council sent out the guide - called Your Guide to Reducing Food Waste - to more than 30,000 locals 

Advice includes how to ‘go shopping’, where to put your food and how to use up any leftovers.

The leaflet states: ‘Write a shopping list for your meal plan so you only buy what you really need.’

It says in the ‘store correctly’ column: ‘Keep essentials in the cupboard, fridge and freezer and keep an eye on use by and best before dates. 

'Did you know you can freeze bread, cheese and milk?’

And advice on leftovers states: ‘Use up leftovers and pull together a delicious meal by combining them with your favourite ingredients.’

Other advice in the leaflet includes how to measure out the correct amount of rice, spaghetti and pasta - so you do not make too much.

Locals say the advice is ‘insulting’, adding that it seems to be aimed at children rather than adults.

One resident, Craig Saunders, 34, said today: ‘When I got the leaflet through the door I thought I’d give it a glance before putting it in the recycling bin.

‘When I read that it said I should put food in the fridge or cupboard and that I should write a shopping list I assumed the leaflet was for children.

‘But no, it’s for us council taxpayers who are too dumb to work out how put away food. 

'It’s incredible really, although I didn’t realise you could freeze milk, so I suppose I learned something at least.’

Another local, Sarah Carson, 46, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I read the leaflet - I thought it was a prank really.

'Surely everybody knows to put some foods in the fridge and others in the cupboard.

'And most people are aware that a shopping list is reasonably important when going shopping. 

'I know the council might be trying to be helpful, but this leaflet is really just a massive waste of our council tax money.’

A spokesman for the council said the leaflet was aimed at reducing the amount of waste.

She added: ‘Recent analysis showed 30 percent of residents’ black bin content is food waste.

‘This costs council taxpayers money in landfill charges, and costs us all in terms of the environmental impact.’

The council's press office did not immediately answer a request from MailOnline to establish how much money was spent on the leaflets.
