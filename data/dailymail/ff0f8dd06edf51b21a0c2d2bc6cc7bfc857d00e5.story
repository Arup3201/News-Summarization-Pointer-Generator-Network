The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are well accustomed to lavish meals and the finest culinary offerings but during their trip to Cambridge they took a break from fine dining and instead enjoying a pub lunch.

In fact, the Royal couple chose pub food over a possible banquet at Cambridge University or a meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant.

Kate and William tucked into mini burgers, fish goujons, chips and sandwiches at the popular Fort St George pub during their visit to the university city yesterday.

The pair picked the quiet 16th Century pub by the River Cam, rather than the Midsummer House restaurant next door, recently named the best for food in the East of England.

The party of 12, which included the Lord Lieutenant and the couple’s protection squad, sat in the restaurant section after talking to staff.

Pub manager Gail Pritchard said the couple liked the food so much they went up for seconds.

'They seemed very hungry, I guess they’d had a very busy morning walking around Cambridge,' she said.

'It was absolutely amazing to meet them, it was a very relaxing and chilled out lunch.'

She said William and Kate sat at a table by the window so they could watch the boats go past on the River Cam.

'It’s a very pretty pub and they had a river view. I think Prince William just wanted a nice pub lunch with his wife away from all the cameras.

'They said they enjoyed the food and even went back for seconds.'

The Duke and Duchess ate smoked salmon, tuna and beef sandwiches, mini burgers, fish goujons, chips and fresh fruit.

The Fort St George is the oldest pub on the River Cam in Cambridge and features Ingle nook fireplaces and old oak beams- the couple were said to have enjoyed the view

Manager Gail said they were asked a month ago if the Royal couple could drop by as they wanted somewhere quiet to rest and they closed the pub so they could enjoy a private lunch.

'There were a few boaters who went by on the river who were very surprised to see them,' she added.

'It was a real honour to have the couple here.'

Prince William and Kate had earlier attended a reception for 400 people at Cambridge University and arrived at the pub mid-afternoon.
