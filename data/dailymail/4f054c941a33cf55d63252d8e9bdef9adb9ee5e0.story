As a child, she grew up  feeling she was nobody's child. At just four years old, Jessica Stoate lost her father. Then, ten years later,  her mother died of cancer.

It was at that moment, devastated at the loss of both parents when she was just 14 years old, that Jessica vowed to help others.

'I made a promise that no other little girl will ever have to lose what I lost, or live how I have lived,' she told MailOnline. 

And today, on Mother's Day, the 23-year-old from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey is fulfilling her promise.

Jessica Stoate was four years old when her father, Richard, pictured, died from a heart defect 

Ten years later in June 2006, her mother Samantha died after a five-year battle with cancer 

She is embarking on a campaign to raise money and awareness for the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan.

Recalling the moment she realised her mother had passed away, Jessica said: 'I just remember saying, "I hadn't finished watching the sun go down with you".'

And on losing her father she added: 'I could never describe what it's like to hear that it's the end, when those words are coming from the other half of your heartbeat.'

Growing up, Jessica kept her tragic past a secret from  friends, eager that no one treat her differently.

But to mark Mother's Day she has found her voice, singing for the first time in public since losing her parents to kickstart her campaign.

'I'm finally speaking out about my story as part of a promise I made to my parents - to do anything I could think of to make sure that as many mums and dads as possible could survive cancer, to be around to watch their children grow up,' she said.

'No one should grow up feeling, as I did, like they're nobody's child. Anthony Nolan is a charity that can stop that happening to other families.' 

Explaining why she kept her secret for years, Jessica added: 'I never wanted to be defined by what I'd lost.

‘Mothers’ Day was coming up and I was really miserable, I was missing my mum and struggling with my degree. I began to wonder what a difference I could make if I finally told my story.’ 

It was at that moment, devastated at the loss of both parents when she was just 14 years old, that Jessica vowed to help others. 'I made a promise that no other little girl will ever have to lose what I lost, or live how I have lived,' she told MailOnline

Today, the 23-year-old is fulfilling her promise and embarking on a fundraising campaign for the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan. Jessica, pictured with her boyfriend Tristan, is running the London Marathon 

She decided to make a video of her singing, to tell her story and promote the Jessica's Promise campaign. 

'It was a really big thing for me to sing as it was something so special between my mum and me,' she said.

'Whenever things got tough or stressful we went for a drive with the roof down and sang. It took years to get to that point of being able to sing again, it always reminded me of what I'd lost.' 

She added: 'I'm hoping to show people that we are not defined by our darkest moments.

'I can't change how my story ended, but by running 26.2 miles and helping Anthony Nolan save the lives of people with blood cancer, I hope I can be a part of somebody else's happy ending.' 

Five years after Jessica's father, Richard, died from a heart defect, her mother Samantha was diagnosed with breast cancer.

'When she had cancer, she just sat me down and said, "OK, I've got cancer, but we are going to fight this together", and that was all she said,' Jessica said.

'She was such a strong woman, she kept everything so normal.

'I was so young I couldn't understand the gravity of it. When she lost her hair, she took me to pick a wig for her.

'She made it all so normal and the cancer became just another part of our everyday life.'  

Growing up, Jessica refrained from sharing her past with friends, eager that no one treat her differently

Five years after Jessica's father, Richard, died from a heart defect, her mother Samantha was diagnosed with breast cancer. After treatment, her mother's disease went into remission, but it returned when Jessica was 13

Samantha went into remission, but around four years later, when her daughter was 13, the disease returned. And this time it spread.

'I had been away on a Duke of Edinburgh weekend and everyone's mum and dad came to pick them up,' Jessica recalled. 

'But my mum didn't. I thought she would be well enough to do it, but when I got home and she opened the door I saw she had deteriorated so much over the weekend.

'I realised then that it wasn't going to be OK.'

A few weeks later Samantha was rushed to hospital and later passed away at home.

It was June 2006 and Jessica was 14 years old. It was also the 10th anniversary of the death of her father, Richard.

Until the age of 16, Jessica lived with her aunt and completed school. 

Recently she graduated from Surrey University with a first class degree in psychology. 

After volunteering at last year's London Marathon to cheer in the crowds, Jessica was inspired to take on this year's run.

She joked: 'I'm not remotely a runner, I must be insane.

'The last time I ran anywhere was for the bus when I was 14. I missed it.'

The 23-year-old chose Anthony Nolan as her charity to support after looking back at her time sitting with her mother in hospital.

Jessica chose to support Anthony Nolan after sitting with her mother in hospital as she went through cancer treatment. She said: 'There was nothing I could do. I used to sit on the cancer ward holding her hand, and think about how I could change this ending for other people facing the same future'

Jessica added: 'This isn’t the life I would have chosen, and growing up without either of my parents has meant that a part of me will always be missing. But I am the luckiest person in the world for having had two people so exceptional to lose'

'There was nothing I could do,' she told MailOnline. 'I used to sit on the cancer ward holding her hand, and think about how I could change this ending for other people facing the same future.

'Supporting Anthony Nolan became the opportunity to do exactly that - they re-write people's stories everyday by matching selfless strangers with people in desperate need of a transplant, completely changing their destiny.  

‘This isn’t the life I would have chosen, and growing up without either of my parents has meant that a part of me will always be missing. 

'But I am the luckiest person in the world for having had two people so exceptional to lose.’
