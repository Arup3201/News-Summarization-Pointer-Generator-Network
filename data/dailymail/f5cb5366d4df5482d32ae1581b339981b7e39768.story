A brand new hotel has skipped the recruitment process - because all its staff are robots.

From reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters, the Pengheng Space Capsules Hotel in Shenzhen, China, has built, rather than hired, their new employees.

Start-up costs and robot maintenance aside, staff bills must be minimal. And it seems the hotel is keen to pass their savings right back to the customer as a night's stay costs just £6.80 per night.

The Pengheng Space Capsules Hotel in Shenzhen, China, combines minimalism with a futuristic vibe

Situated in Shenzhen's Bao'an 
District, the micro hotel has gained widespread media 
attention after being open for just three months.

Rocket News 24 has confirmed there is a skeleton staff overseeing operations.

While there is a very small number of 
operations staff, the vast majority of menial tasks within the hotel are
 carried out by machines.

You
 can even order food and drinks from the lounge area using supplied 
tablet computers, and your choices arriving via robot waiter just a few 
minutes later.

Best of all, however, is the price. A
 stay in the hotel costs a mere 70 yuan (£6.81) per person. For that price you might not expect much, but the 
hotel's facilities are impressive.

This capsule hotel - a hotel format coined in Japan featuring many extremely small rooms dubbed capsules - combines affordable and minimalist overnight accommodation with a futuristic vibe.

The capsules look like they've been lifted out of a sci-fi movie

A eerie blue-lit corridor leads to the space station-style bunks, which resemble something 
lifted out of a sci-fi film.

The hotel also features banks of computers, lockers, washrooms and a DIY laundry room.

With robots, neon and shiny surfaces as far as the eye can see, a stay in the hotel has become a must for both local and visiting tech fans.

Capsule hotels were originally developed in Japan. They feature a large number of very small rooms
