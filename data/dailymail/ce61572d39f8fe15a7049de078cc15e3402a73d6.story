It's been three years since Turia Pitt was caught in a ferocious bush fire after being trapped in a remote gorge while running a 100km marathon in Western Australia.

The 26-year-old suffered severe burns to 64 per cent of her body in 2011, fought back from a two-month coma and rehabilitated from more than 100 operations.

But her journey to recovery continues as she's determined to overcome yet another obstacle - getting back on her surfboard and ride 'some of the world's most perfect and uncrowded waves'.

Sydney award-winning filmmaker Mark Brightwell, known for co-creating hit surf film Raw The Movie, will be documenting Turia's return to surfing.

The pair are trying to raise $60,000 for the film through crowd-funding.

'Phoenix is about overcoming adversity and never giving up and finding that piece of inner strength that we all have inside of us,' Turia said on Pozible.

The burns survivor hopes to return to Tahiti, which is where she was born.

'I really think that's where my love for ocean began,' Turia said.

'I've always had such a strong connection with the water and that was something that I definitely lost during the 2011 Kimberley ultramarathon.

'Three years on, my fight back continues.'

Turia, who was a part-time model and 2007 contestant in Miss Earth Australia, received skin grafts on her back, legs and face.

She's had half of her left foot amputated while half of her right index finger is missing and her other fingers remain scarred and disfigured.

'I guess this movie is not just about surfing, it's about getting back into the water, reclaiming my fitness and shooting in some of the world's best surfing locations,' Turia said.

Brightwell, who will be directing the film, told Daily Mail Australia he was captivated by Turia's determination, passion and her never-give-up attitude.

'Phoenix is a bird that is burnt to ashes and rises again and that's obviously symbolic to Turia's story,' he said.

'I've always wanted to create a film that would make a difference in people's lives and Phoenix the documentary is that opportunity.

'While I want to capture Turia's return to surfing, which has been a big part of her upbringing, through this film we also want to give people who've suffered tragedy hope and show them there is light at the end of the tunnel.'

Among Turia's many talents she is a mining engineer, the author of 'Everything to live for' and aÂ  motivational speaker.

She also one of the winners of the NSW Premier's 2014 Women of the Year Awards.

Phoenix is set to be released in 2015.
