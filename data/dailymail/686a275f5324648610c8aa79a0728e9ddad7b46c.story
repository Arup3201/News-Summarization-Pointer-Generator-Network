Summer's sleeveless dresses, bandeau tops and spaghetti straps all call for one thing - the dreaded strapless bra.

It's hard to find a woman who loves these creations. Traditionally, they fall down (quite literally) in several areas.

Designed for practicality over prettiness, they're usually uncomfortable and unflattering, often squeezing your breasts into any shape other than the silhouette you actually desire.

As a 32C, I've found that strapless bras offer very little support for anyone above a B cup, and as for giving you any kind of cleavage, forget it.

Then, of course, there's the 'strapless shuffle', the annoying wriggle-scoop-tug move you have to perform at regular intervals to avoid a wardrobe malfunction when moving fast, hailing a taxi, or - heaven forbid  - walking down the aisle.

But finally it seems that the fashion industry has woken up to such criticisms and dreamt up a new generation of strapless styles.

These high-tech bras promise not only to look good and feel comfortable, but to stay put on bigger boobs, create cleavage and even do away with the wriggle-scoop-tug for ever.

With a strapless dress to get into for a family party, I tried some on for size . . .

No frills, no nonsense: John Lewis

JOHN LEWIS

Padded, underwired bra, £20, johnlewis.com

Jenny says: A fairly basic white design that does the job without frills. The padded, seam-free underwired cups were nice and smooth and gave good support, but the bra didn't fit as  snugly as some of the other styles.

It seemed to separate my boobs rather than push them together, and the bottom of the underwiring dug into my ribs slightly.

For £20, it's a decent bra, but not particularly special.

GOSSARD

Decent: Gossard

Superboost satin black bra, £30, gossard.com

Jenny says: This comes with little round pillows called 'launch pads' to slot into the cups for extra oomph. They create a decent cleavage but took up so much space there was hardly any room left for my breasts, so the top gaped slightly and I felt a bit exposed. It's not great for wearing with plunging styles unless you want to have someone's eye out. 

On a positive note, it created a lovely smooth profile at the sides with  no overspill, and looked sexy  yet stylish.

2/5

H&M - BEST LOOKING

Best looking: H&M

Black bra with white lace, £12.99, hm.com

Jenny says: By far the prettiest, this fitted snugly against my chest bone (the sign of a good bra, an expert fitter once told me), gave a slight uplift thanks to inbuilt padding, and didn't gape at the top.

It did dig in a bit at the side, which might make it uncomfortable over long periods, and there was a bit of underarm overspill, but for under £13, you can't complain.

A beautiful bargain.

3/5

Classy: Wonderbra

WONDERBRA

Ultimate bra, £36, wonderbra.eu

Jenny says: It uses 'patent-pending hand-shaped technology to give lift, support and the classic Wonderbra cleavage you're looking for'. The hand-shaped internal supports are made to feel like someone cupping your breasts. It gave me a classy, natural-looking cleavage with just the right amount of uplift.

It felt incredibly tight at first, and there was a bit of overhang at the sides, but it didn't budge, even when I jumped up  and down.

4/5

Best all rounder: M&S

M&S - BEST ALL ROUNDER

Memory foam bra, £22.50, marks andspencer.com

Jenny says: If there is a holy grail of strapless bras, this could be it. It has 'new non-slip wing technology - amazing memory foam moulds to your shape for the perfect fit'. Made of the same stuff you get in fancy pillows and mattresses, the moulds were incredibly comfy.

The sides were a rubbery-feel fabric, which gripped without digging in and stopped anything spilling over the top. I almost forgot I was wearing it. What's more, it's a decent price, too. My favourite by a mile.

5/5

Luxurious: Myla

MYLA

Bodysilk aubergine bra, £45, myla.com

Jenny says: The priciest bra I tested, this is 94 per cent silk, and it certainly felt soft and luxurious. It stays in place thanks to boned sides and silicone bands at the back and sides, but would probably suit small to medium cup sizes best as there's not much there to hold larger chests in place.

It gave a flattering natural shape, wasn't too tight and didn't gape. The only downside is the seams might show under tight tops.

4/5

WACOAL

Least favourite: Wacoal

Nude lace bandeau, £39, Wacoal.co.uk

Jenny says: Understated and nude, this is definitely one for those with smaller chests. A more traditional strapless style, it's underwired with a non-slip, slightly sticky silicone band, but that's about it.

The simple lace offered very little in the way of support and it left my boobs looking slightly squished. It's so sheer your nipples would be in danger of showing through your clothes - which is never a good look. My least favourite of the lot.

1/5

FENWICK - BEST FOR EVERYDAY

Best for everyday: Fenwick

Moulded cup bra, £39,  Fenwick (020 7629 9161)

Jenny says: With plain black moulded underwired cups and soft sides that don't dig in, this Princesse Tam Tam bra is great for everyday use.

There was slight overhang at the sides - perhaps the price you pay for comfort - but all-over padding gave me a nice shape and the cups sat smoothly against my chest, making it ideal for wearing with snug-fitting tops.

Silicone bands around the top and bottom helped it stay put when I raised my arms skywards. It comes with see-through detachable straps, but I reckon you're better off without them.

4/5

DEBENHAMS

Dreaded overspill: Debenhams

Secret support cream bra, £25, debenhams.com

Jenny says: Seam-free with moulded foam cups would work well under close-fitting clothes. Like many I tried, it has optional straps for extra support when wearing halterneck or  cross-back style tops.

The 'integrated secret support panels' claim to provide support and 'create the perfect lift', but while it gave me a better shape than the average strapless bra, it did mean a bit of boob overspill at the top.

It's so tight around the ribcage it would definitely stay put while dancing - though breathing might be a challenge.

H&M's £12.99 black bra with white lace is the best looking

At £39, Fenwick's bra is expensive but you'll wear it all the time

M&S's memory foam bra though is the best all rounder
