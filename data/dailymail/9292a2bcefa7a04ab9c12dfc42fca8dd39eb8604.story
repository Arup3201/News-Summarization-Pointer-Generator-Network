Ann Compton will retire on the 41st anniversary of her joining ABC News after covering seven presidencies as a White House reporter.

Compton became the first woman to work as a White House reporter for network news back in 1974 when she began covering the Ford administration for ABC.

'It’s just a good moment to go,' Compton told Politico. 'It’s going to be a different business.'

Fond farewell: Ann Compton is retiring from ABC News after becoming its first female White House reporter and spending 41 years with the network

Over a 40 year career, Compton developed a shining reputation among colleagues for her reporting and many wished her well after news of her retirement broke.

ABC News Washington Bureau Chief Robin Sproul called Compton 'a reporter of boundless energy who brings her A-game every day.'

New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker tweeted, 'There’s no better journalist, no more generous colleague, no classier act in White House briefing room than @AnnCompton.'

Compton has the distinction of traveling to all 50 states while covering the presidential campaigns of numerous presidential candidates.

She was also the only broadcast journalist allowed to remain on Air Force One with George W. Bush in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks.

Compton's career began in Virginia, where she got a job in Roanoke at a local CBS affiliate after an internship during college.

ABC News plucked her out of Virginia and hired her to work in the company's New York offices in 1973 before sending her to the White House in 1974.

Her list of awards and accolades was capped off by a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Washington Press Club given to her earlier this year.

Compton will take one last trip overseas when President Obama travels to the NATO summit in Wales before retiring on September 10.
