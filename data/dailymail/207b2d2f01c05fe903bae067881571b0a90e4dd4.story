Most of us are pleased to make a paper plane that can fly, but one accomplished artist has taken the pastime of origami to the next level.

Master of paper folding, Matthieu Georger, shows off his amazing animal sculptures on the internet.

From tiny bugs to mighty beasts, he boasts 131 pictures of his intricate designs and creations on his Flickr account.

Most sculptures are based on the designs of others, such as this impressive king cobra by Ronald Koh

Detail: The close up photographs of each artwork let you appreciate the craftsmanship in each piece

Inspiration: Georger's green folded tree frog was based on a design by Robert J. Lang

Some of Georger's creations are based on theÂ designs of advanced origami masters such as Satoshi Kamiya, Dao Cuong Quyet and Ronald Koh. He replicates their models with his own paper folding technique, often adding a personal touch.

He also has also produced original works which have formed part of an exhibition in Paris this year.

A combination of soft contours, rather 
than harsh, straight edges, intricate craftsmanship and various colours 
of tissue paper make Georger's sculptures hyper-detailed and life-like.

Bought back to life: Smilodon, an extinct saber-toothed cat, designed by Satoshi Kamiya, folded by Georger

Lifelike: Hercules Beetle, the most famous and largest of the rhinoceros beetles, design by Satoshi Kamiya

Vibrant: The bright colours of the Poison Dart Frog warn off predators and this paper replica would certainly fool them

The Japanese art of paper folding, origami, was an ancient skill passed down the generations until in 1797 the first origami book was published containing instructions on mastering the technique.

The word derives from the Japanese words: 'ori' (folding) and 'kami' (paper) meaning paper.

It quickly became popular outside of Japan and has since then evolved into a modern art form.

The
goal is to transform a flat sheet of paper into a finished sculpture 
through folding and sculpting techniques. Cutting the paper or gluing it
is not considered to be true origami.

Black beauty: This origami sculpture is of Sleipnir, an eight-legged horse from Norse mythology

Fin-tastic: Scales are recreated on the pufferfish using perfectly placed folds

Pond life: Lily pads and a dragonfly are created by Georger in this scene based on the designs of Robert Lang

Animal magic: Hooves, a mane and the horse's muscles are all defined by the paper folds

Creepy crawly: This leaf katydid looks real

School of origami: These fish were created by the artist using his paper folding techniques
