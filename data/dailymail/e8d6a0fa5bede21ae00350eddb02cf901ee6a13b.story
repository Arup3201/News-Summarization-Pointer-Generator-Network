Self-proclaimed celebrity gangster Dave Courtney turned the back garden of his London home into a brutal bare-knuckle boxing den for a fight night watched by 300 baying punters.

Courtney, who claims to have been a cohort of the Kray twins, hosted the event at his Plumstead house as part of a nationwide tour aimed at cleaning up the sport's barbaric image.

The violent combat was once confined to back-street drinking dens and gambled on by gangland villains. It was often a fight to the death, with no rules - and definitely no first aid.

But the practice is enjoying something of a renaissance - and it's completely legal.

Self-proclaimed gangster Dave Courtney recently hosted a bare-knuckle fight watched by 300 people in his back garden and says the sport has been rid of corruption

The sport, labelled barbaric in some quarters, has traditionally been held without rules in underground drinking dens frequented by gambling gangsters

Reporters infiltrated one such fight, held in Courtney's garden. And despite the host's reputation, there were no snarling pitbulls or gun-toting heavies overseeing the action, but a referee, 300 paying punters, not a villain in sight and no gambling.

Dave Courtney was born in Bermondsey, London, in 1959.

The 55-year-old has made a name for himself through his supposed affiliation with famous hardmen such as Reggie Kray.

He was only nine when the Krays were jailed, but claims to have arranged security for Ronnie Kray's funeral in 1995.

Courtney became infamous as a knuckle-duster wielding debt collector, and claims to have been shot, stabbed and had his nose almost bitten off.

He claims to have been found not guilty in 19 separate trials but in January 2009 he was given an 18-month conditional discharge at Bristol Crown Court, on a charge of possessing live ammunition without a firearms certificate.

In recent times he has become something of a celebrity figure, making a living from appearances in numerous television documentaries and a number of low-budget British gangster films.

The packed crowd were witnessing the first transatlantic championship ‘BKB' bout for more than 120 years, with pubs taking a pay-per-view video feed of the action.

According to Courtney, the sport is 
unrecognisable from the past.

He said in the Daily Mirror: 'In the old days, the crowd 
would have been 90% villains. Tensions ran high because there was a lot 
of money at stake and each firm wanted to keep their rep.

'But
 today it’s all about the glory. Look for yourself – there’s no 
security, there’s no trouble here. It’s a lot more civilised. It’s 
the most gladiatorial form of combat that is still available for the 
normal person to go and see and I’m glad it’s a bit less underground 
now.'

The re-birth of the sport, immortalised in the Brad Pitt film, Fight Club, is thanks to former fighter and pub landlord Andy Topcliffe, who was so disgusted by the treatment of one Polish fighter left to die in the street that he says he knew he had to act.

He told the paper: 'This guy was in real trouble and the promoters just jumped in their car and legged it. I knew I needed to do something. By removing the illegal money we removed corruption and the welfare of the fighters is paramount.'

Bare-knuckle boxing was never outlawed but with the emergence of the Queensbury Rules and gloved bouts in 1867 it shrank into the back streets to be taken over by villains .

The combatants are different from the old days, with builders, property developers and spray-painters getting involved.

Courtney, an ex-cohort of the Kray things, says it's a good thing the sport has moved mainstream but is glad it still carries a high risk of danger

Previous bills have also featured soldiers, a solicitor, and a PE teacher. They take home just £250 for having a go and many say they do it for the thrill and the feeling of being like a 'real man'.

Fans say bare-knuckle fighting is no different to any other martial art, although it comes under the same 'dangerous exhibition' statute as knife-throwing. It's completely legal.

But despite the introduction of a referee, the action remains brutal.

In the first bout seen at Courtney's house, one fighter hits his opponent so hard on the head his hand instantly fractures and the fight is over, while another combatant is left out cold from a massive left hook.

Violent: Despite the sport's best efforts to clean up its act, it can still attract the wrong crowd, as shown here when police had to break up a fight at a village fair

The craze is attracting celebrities, professionals and even women, who made up around a fifth of the crowd.

Film stars Keanu Reeves and Ray Winstone are fans of Andy’s B-Bad Promotions, the Leicestershire-based firm behind the venture.

Mr Topcliffe takes the tour to Wales next month and said ticket sales have been good. 'We'll go wherever people want us, he said. 'And they seem to be wanting us more than ever.'
