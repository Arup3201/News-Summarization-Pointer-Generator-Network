Johnny Callie, who was jailed for seven years for drug dealing, has fought deportation on the grounds he relies on NHS care and has a depressed partner

An 
American crack dealer has won the right to stay in Britain because he 
relies on free NHS medical care and has a depressed girlfriend.

Johnny
 Callie was jailed for seven years in 2007 for conspiracy to supply 
crack cocaine and heroin following a two-year covert operation by 
Ipswich police.

Callie
 was part of a 10-strong gang that flooded the area with drugs from 
their base in Colchester and was arrested following raids in August 
2005.

In January, 2011 Home Secretary Theresa May refused to revoke an order for Callie's deportation after he appealed the automatic order made following his sentencing in November 2007.

But the decorated Vietnam war veteran, who is suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure and 'degenerative changes to his right knee' has now argued he would not be able to afford medical care in the US. He also cited the ill health of his long-term girlfriend.

The 64-year-old has been fighting his deportation through the courts since his release from prison in August 2010.

He earlier halted the order on the grounds it breached his right to family life under Article 8 of the European Convention for Human Rights.

Mrs May appealed that decision, but Judge Bernard Dawson ruled that Callie could stay.

He heard that Callie had been living with his British citizen partner, referred to in documents as SN, since June 1995, and that she had 'no contact with other members of her family and has very few friends'.

A decision
 by Judge Dawson reads: 'Due to her depression and anxiety she is 
usually dependent upon the claimant and cannot easily leave her home on her own or travel outside Ipswich unless he is with her.

Judge Bernard Dawson said Callie's age and medical conditions would make it difficult for him to find work

'She
 would experience high level of anxiety were she to leave her home and 
travel to America with the claimant. She has a history of attempted 
suicide.'

Judge Dawson's decision goes on to say the woman would be unable to stay in the US unless she married Callie, who has two sons who are both British citizens.

He said 
Callie's partner would not be entitled to Medicaid and it 'is unlikely 
the couple could afford private health insurance'.

The judge added: 'The claimant has not 
lived in the United States since 1984, has no property there and in the 
light of his age and his medical conditions it would be difficult for him to obtain employment.'

A letter from Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust from February 2014 said Callie's compliance had been 'excellent' and that he didn't demonstrate any behaviour that would 'lead to further offending'.

The letter said Callie had remained drug free since his release and had not relied on welfare benefits.

His girlfriend is too depressed to leave their home, let alone move to the US
