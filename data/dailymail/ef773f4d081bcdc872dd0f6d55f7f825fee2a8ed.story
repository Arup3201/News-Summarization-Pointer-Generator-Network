Call to action: David Cameron is being urged to help thousands of badly wounded British veterans

David Cameron is being urged to help thousands of badly wounded British veterans who are being forced to use their war pensions to pay for social care.

Under the rules, veterans injured on or before April 5, 2005, must hand over most of their weekly injury compensation payments should they require social care.

By contrast, service personnel wounded after that date are entitled to keep all their payments because they are paid out of a different Government scheme.

Now the Royal British Legion, backed by many MPs, is calling on the Prime Minister to correct this anomaly, which penalises veterans of the Second World War, the Falklands War, Northern Ireland and both Gulf Wars.

Last night, Sir Bob Russell MP, a member of the Commons’ Defence Select Committee, said: ‘It’s an absurdity that some veterans should be discriminated against in this way. So I will be asking the Prime Minister for an explanation as to who drew up this dividing line and on what basis this date was chosen.’

Veterans injured in service on or before April 5, 2005, receive a War Disablement Pension and are known as War Pensioners. Those who have social care needs routinely find councils take all but £10 per week of their compensation to cover their care costs.

This is despite the fact that a veteran with a similar injury who was wounded after the cut-off date is able to keep all of their compensation. 

This is because councils are instructed to fully exempt payments made under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) from any means testing for social care. 

Former submariner Keith Clarke, 43, a paraplegic, is forced to give £100 per week to meet the costs of his social care, which includes daily visits by a care worker.

Normandy veteran Fred Cannon, 90, who suffered gunshot wounds in 1944, apparently has ‘very little money left over’ after his council has taken his pension to pay for nursing home fees.

Since 2005, some 16,000 injured troops have been paid almost £341 million in compensation from the AFCS scheme.

A Royal British Legion spokesman said: ‘Military compensation is awarded as a recompense for pain, suffering and loss of amenity experienced by injured service personnel and veterans.

‘It should not be treated as normal income. The system is unfair and has to change.’
