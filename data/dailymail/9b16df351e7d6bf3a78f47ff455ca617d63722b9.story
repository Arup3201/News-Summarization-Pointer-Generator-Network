Many students have already registered for the cut price offer on botox

Students at the University of Central Lancashire have been offered Botox and other facial enhancements at discount prices as part of the institution's new master's programme in medicine.

Feminist campaigners in the student body are outraged by the offer, claiming that the university has failed its duty of care and is promoting unhealthy ideas of beauty and aging among young people at a vulnerable age,

Registered students are now able to book appointments for Botox and fillers, lip enhancers, facial peels and laser treatments, all conducted by healthcare professionals who are studying for an MSc at the university, the Huffington Post reports.

The service is offered as part of the university's MSc/PGDip in Non-Surgical Facial Aesthetics for Registered Healthcare Professionals.

The graduate programme offers a part-time qualification in facial cosmetic enhancements for healtcare professionals wishing to branch out into the a booming industry.

A spokesman from the university said: 'Over recent years, the provision of non-surgical facial aesthetic treatments has emerged as a key growth area within healthcare delivery in the United Kingdom.

'UCLan's MSc/PgDip Facial Aesthetics programme is designed to ensure that practising clinicians, be they doctors or dentists, are recognised to be the leading evidence-based practitioners in their field.'

The saddest thing about the situation is the revelation from the Dental Clinic, where the procedures will take place, who claimed that a number of students have registered their interest.

Heather Lomax, a UCLan student and member of the UCLan Feminist society has spoken of her outrage at learning of the university's offer.

She told the Huffington Post's Faye Grima: 'UCLan is a university, and should be offering education and supporting the health and needs of students, not offering Botox, which certainly has its risks. The very idea of it, of students feeling the need to beat the (perfectly natural) aging process, to have perfect skin, makes me feel sick.'

The University of Central Lancashire introduced the course to meet demands in a growing industry

Ed Farthing, a third-year English studies student also expressed his disgust with the recent proposals.

He said: 'Botox and similar treatments epitomise the ever-growing modern day fanaticism with the "perfect self" image, and often enough force users into a never-ending life of constant addictive usage.'
