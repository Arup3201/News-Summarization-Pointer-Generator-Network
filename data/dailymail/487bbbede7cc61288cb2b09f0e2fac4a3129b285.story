Coronation Street star Wililam Roache has been charged with indecently assaulting girls during the 1960s

Coronation Street actor Bill Roache was last night charged with sexually assaulting another four girls, one as young as 11.

A month after the soap star, 81, was charged with twice raping a schoolgirl in 1967, he was re-arrested and accused of further child sex offences.

The new allegations against Roache, who has played Ken Barlow over six decades, are claimed to have happened in the Manchester area between 1965 and 1968 and involve four girls who were aged between 11 or 12 and 16 at the time.

Roache, who has strenuously denied the previous rape allegations, is due in Preston magistrates’ court over the new charges this morning.

He is one of the best-known stars to be held over child sex allegations in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

His friend Stuart Hall, the disgraced BBC TV presenter, is due to be sentenced later this month after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls during the 1960s, 70s and 80s.

One was aged just nine when she was molested by the It’s a Knockout host.

The Crown Prosecution Service said three of the new offences allegedly committed by Roache took place in 1965 and two in 1968.

Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West, said: ‘We have carefully considered all the evidence gathered by Lancashire Police in relation to recent allegations from four complainants that William Roache indecently assaulted them in the 1960s.

‘Having completed our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr Roache to be charged with five offences of indecent assault relating to four girls who were aged between 11 or 12 and 16 at the time that the alleged offences happened.

‘We have been reviewing evidence and providing early investigative advice to Lancashire Police regarding these allegations, which were made to police after Mr Roache was charged with two offences of rape on 1 May 2013.’

Roache – the world’s longest-serving soap actor – has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, but will not be appearing in the programme until legal proceedings are concluded.

The CPS said: 'It is in the public interest for Mr Roache to be charged with five offences of indecent assault'

Fans of the soap were stunned when 
the twice-married star was taken into custody following a raid at his 
home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, last month and charged with twice raping a 
15-year-old girl in 1967 when he was 35 and married to his first wife.

In a statement issued by his lawyers 
after he was charged with those offences, he said: ‘I am astounded and 
deeply horrified by the extraordinary events of the last 24 hours.

‘I strenuously deny the allegations 
and will now focus my full attention on fighting to preserve my 
innocence in the challenging times ahead.

‘I would like to offer my sincere 
thanks to all those people who have offered me their support and good 
wishes at this difficult time.’

In March, Roache issued a public 
apology after he claimed in a TV interview that sex abuse victims 
brought it upon themselves and were being punished for sins in a past 
life.

He also called for the same anonymity
for those accused of child sex offences as alleged victims are given 
until conviction because of the stigma they faced even if subsequently 
found innocent.

Following the new charges, Roache was seen arriving back at his secluded, £650,000 home just before 6.30pm yesterday.

He was driven there by his lawyer 
Brian Russell who will be representing him in court this morning. He 
emerged from the front passenger seat of the car and walked to the 
pavement to punch in the code to the substantial black electronic gates 
across his drive.

Off air: Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell was charged with 19 sexual offences against a child. His charges are not connected to William Roache's charges

Dressed in blue trousers, a 
lightweight blue jacket over a white, open-neck shirt and wearing 
lightly tinted glasses, Roach refused to answer questions about the 
latest charges laid against him, offering reporters a thin-lipped 
grimace.

Fellow Coronation Street star Michael
Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air 
after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including 
rape, indecent assault and sexual activity.

He denies the charges, which
are not linked to Roache.

Roache’s marriage to his first wife, Anna, ended in divorce in 1974. His second wife Sara died in 2009.

Earlier this year it was revealed he 
ended his two-year relationship with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, 44, so 
he could explore a ‘mystic message of love’ linked to his membership of 
the Pure Love Movement, a religious group.

Last month, the Mail revealed that 
comedian Jim Davidson is being investigated by Yewtree officers over 
claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 
1980s during a concert tour.

The attack is alleged to have 
happened while the former Generation Game host was entertaining British 
troops stationed there after the Falklands conflict.

Davidson, 59, was originally arrested
in January of this year over alleged sex offences in the UK. He denies 
all the allegations. Other arrested celebrities include entertainer Rolf
Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedian Freddie Starr.

Disgraced pop star Glitter has also been detained. They all deny any wrongdoing.

PR guru Max Clifford has been charged with 11 historic counts of indecent assault against teenage girls.

The 70-year-old has vowed to clear his name, labelling the allegations ‘a load of nonsense’.

Critics claim the Yewtree investigation has become a celebrity witch-hunt. But Yard chiefs insist it is fair and proportionate.

At least one more celebrity is expected to face criminal charges in the coming weeks.

Detained: Chris Denning helped launch Gary Glitter's career

A former Radio 1 DJ has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Chris Denning, 72, was detained at a hostel in East London by officers working on Operation Yewtree.

Scotland Yard said the suspect, whom they have not formally named, was questioned on suspicion of sexual offences.

Yesterday it emerged that the arrested man was Denning and that he was quizzed over ‘historic allegations’.

It is understood he is not accused of any offences with Savile, a former colleague.

Denning was one of the original Radio 1 DJs alongside Tony Blackburn, Jimmy Young, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan, Pete Murray, Ed Stewart and John Peel when the station launched in 1967.

Denning later helped launch the career of Gary Glitter.

He lived overseas but recently has been staying at a hostel for the homeless which the Mail is not identifying for legal reasons.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
