Gareth Bale has dismissed speculation over a transfer to Manchester United and insists his relationship with Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo is as strong as ever.

The Welsh forward said that he has several years left on his Madrid deal and tried to put to bed rumours that he wasn't happy in the Spanish capital.

Bale spoke on Cadena SER radio show 'El Larguero' on Tuesday night, where host Jose Ramon de la Morena described him as 'shy, introverted and simple'.

Gareth Bale says his relationship with star Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't changed

Bale was called a 'ball hog' earlier in the season after not passing to Ronaldo during a game with Espanyol

When asked about the recent allegations that he was selfish for not passing to Ronaldo when through on goal, Bale replied: 'All I can remember is going for the ball and feeling very focused on trying to score. I didn't see him, I think it would have been a difficult pass. I haven't spoken to Cristiano about not passing the ball.

'I don't know how much importance was given to it (by the media) but I'm sure people talk a lot about it. But it happens all the time on the football pitch in every team.

'We didn't speak about it at all. What happens on the pitch stays on the pitch and there's nothing personal after.'

Bale was whistled by the Bernabeu crowd after the incident, despite being the man who won them the Copa del Rey against Barcelona and scored a crucial goal in their Champions League triumph last May.

However, not passing to Ronaldo followed a similar incident where he failed to set up French striker Karim Benzema, and the fans did not let him off the hook. However, the 25-year-old insisted he loves playing at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Bale: 'I feel happy, I feel the love from the crowd. I want to show them what I can do on the football pitch.'

'I feel like I'm doing well on the pitch, I score goals, give assists, play each game in my way, it's how I like it,' he said.

'Yeah, I feel happy, I feel the love from the crowd. I want to show them what I can do on the football pitch and win as many trophies as I can.'

'The fans are amazing. I love playing at home, at the Bernabeu, and trying to score more goals, it's what I love to do. It's really exciting to play at home and to score goals.'

Bale has 36 goals in 72 games for Real Madrid, with 25 of those coming in 43 league games, but some have suggested he is looking for an exit route to Old Trafford.

But the Los Blancos star - and the most expensive player in the world - said, when asked if it was possible he could leave: 'For me, no. I've done an interview recently crushing the rumours that I'm not happy here. I've got four and a half more years to go on the contract.'

The host questioned Bale about the general perception that he prefers to stay in, rather than go out and enjoy himself in Madrid.

However, the Welshman said that he did enjoy going out but tries to do it secretly so he can live his life in peace.

'I go out for food quite a lot but try and hide it, and go under the radar,' he said. 'I like to go out with my family and friends and try to live life as normal.

'I've been there (Gran Via, a main street in Madrid) a few times with family and friends, trying to keep a low profile, wearing a hat. It's nice to come out and experience parts of Madrid.'

With Ronaldo set to be suspended for two games or more after being sent off against Cordoba, Bale may have the opportunity to play on the left, where he did for Tottenham.

Former Tottenham star Bale: 'I used to actually like Arsenal a lot. Therry Henry and Vieira were amazing.'

But he said that he is happy to play wherever manager Carlo Ancelotti requires him to.

'The manager picks the team,' he explained. 'I enjoy playing anywhere across the front line, on the right, on the left, in the centre.'

Much of the rest of the interview focused on more trivial affairs, with Bale admitting that he has a golf handicap of eight, and that he used to love watching Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo play for Real Madrid back when he was a boy.

However, one line may upset Tottenham fans hoping that Bale may return to White Hart Lane one day. As Theo Walcott had claimed a few years ago, Bale's blood bleeds red - red for Arsenal.

'I used to actually like Arsenal a lot,' he admitted. 'But when I went to Tottenham I went away from Arsenal. Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira were amazing footballers.'
