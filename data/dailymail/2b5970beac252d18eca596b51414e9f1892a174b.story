Character: Sir Henry Cecil, one of the greatest racehorse trainers of all time died yesterday at the age of 70

Side by side the two figures — one very tall and elegant, the other diminutive and stocky — walked stiffly across the paddock to the horse that one had trained and the other was about to ride in the big race.

All around them at Glorious Goodwood races there were tense and almost disbelieving faces as the trainer gave his jockey a routine ‘leg-up’ into the saddle.

This was a very different kind of race-day tension, one that even in the libidinous, hot‑breath world of horses and riders, Jilly Cooper and Dick Francis might have had difficulty describing.

For the gossip had spread like a hot race tip: everyone knew that just a few hours earlier, the trainer, the elegant aristocrat Henry Cecil, had terminated the contract of his stable jockey Kieren Fallon, son of an Irish plasterer, for sleeping with his wife Natalie after romping in a shower — a claim the jockey has always vehemently denied.

It was too late to change riders, though.

Yesterday Sir Henry died of cancer at the age of 70, bringing to a close a life marked almost as much by scandal as by his achievements as one of the greatest racehorse trainers the sport of kings has ever known.

‘Good with fillies,’ was the running joke in the racing world, for Henry Cecil, something of a dandy, was himself no innocent when it came to illicit relationships.

In recent times he trained the  extraordinary Frankel, owned by Prince Khalid Abdullah of Saudia Arabia, to win 14 races without defeat.

Dying of stomach cancer, and very weak, Cecil lived to see this unique stallion proclaimed the finest racehorse in the world.

Friends are convinced that the chain-smoking dandy in colourful waistcoats and Gucci loafers (who would sometimes give his handmade shirts away at the end of the season to more needy racing folk) was sustained through his illness by the thrill of working with the best horse anyone had seen in his lifetime.

With wife number one: Sir Cecil's first marriage was to Julie Murless, the daughter of another racehorse trainer Sir Noel Murless

Henry Cecil had been at the top — but  he’d also been almost to the bottom and close to bankruptcy. He never lost faith in himself, though: he said that utter self-confidence was the only thing he was good at.

Before horses, he’d never thrived at anything, even failing the entrance exam to Eton. His father, younger brother of the 3rd Lord Amherst of Hackney, was killed in action in World War II, and Henry was still a baby when his widowed 27-year-old mother married the famous trainer Sir Cecil Boyd-Rochfort, who was 57.

Until then Sir Cecil, who trained the Queen’s horses, had been viewed as a confirmed bachelor, but he set about teaching his stepson everything he could about training horses. It was a profession that was to lead Henry Cecil into a series of extraordinary social scandals.

At first, it seemed like the perfect racing partnership when Henry married Julie Murless, daughter of another knighted trainer of the post-war years, Sir Noel Murless.

Sir Noel’s wedding gift to them was Warren Place, his famous racing establishment on the edge of Newmarket.

With wife number two: Sir Cecil married second wife Natalie when she was aged 23 and he was 48

And it was not long before Henry Cecil was training the first of his 25 classic winners — including four Epsom Derbys — and attracting the richest and most ambitious owners. Among them was the most ambitious  of them all, Dubai’s fabulously wealthy Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

By the late Eighties, Henry and Julie had been married some 23 years and had a son and a daughter. That was when Natalie Payne, the daughter of a doctor, arrived in his life.

It was at the staff Christmas party in 1989 that the languorously good-looking Henry and the pretty Natalie, always so fetching in her breeches, got talking over a glass of wine.

She was running a breaking yard for young horses near Newmarket and Cecil took his yearlings to her. The following spring he took her to the horse sales. By the end of the year, his 24-year marriage to Julie had been dissolved.

Incredibly, and with astonishing loyalty to owners such as Sheik Mohammed — who would have been mortified for Warren Place to be broken up in a division of marital property — it was Julie who agreed to move out of the home where she had grown up.

She started a training establishment of her own in Newmarket. Cecil’s  head lad Paddy Rudkin, meanwhile, was so disgusted by the goings-on that he left.

Wife number three: Jane was Sir Henry's secretary before they married five years ago

Henry had already been champion trainer nine times by then. He would win that title only once more, in 1993. The previous year, aged 48, he had married 23-year-old Natalie. And with her arrival, things had changed at the yard considered to be the ‘pinnacle of British racing’.

No one objected when the new Mrs Cecil redecorated Warren Place to her own taste, but other things were being changed, such as the type of food the horses were getting.

Sheik Mohammed grew increasingly unhappy, so much so that in 1995 he removed all 40 of his horses that were in training with Cecil — a major blow. A story was put out that he was angry because he hadn’t been told that one of his horses was injured, but another version was that the trainer’s wife was interfering, and the Sheik — the biggest owner in Britain — refused to put up with it.

It was a hammer-blow to Henry Cecil, who had to build up his reputation all over again. He hadn’t lost his talent, and he had other wealthy owners, but his image was damaged.

A year later, the tough and personable Irish jockey Kieren Fallon arrived to work for Cecil, and was soon riding winners and was proclaimed champion jockey.

Not surprisingly, after the Sheik’s sudden departure, Natalie Cecil’s new-found influence with the horses was much diminished. As Henry concentrated on re-establishing himself as the best in the business, the marriage began to disintegrate.

Within the intimate horsey fraternity of the racing town, some people, especially old friends of Henry’s former wife Julie, had always been hostile to Natalie. Now, they could be openly aggressive.

Cecil’s response was not to remonstrate with his old friends and racing colleagues, but to tell his new wife that she ‘had to earn their respect’.

She began drinking and putting on weight, then fought the resulting depression with more alcohol, diet pills and Prozac.

It was on a visit to Ireland to look at some horses in 1999 that she had a one-night stand with someone she later described as ‘a leading jockey’.

Until then, she said: ‘I had been 100  per cent faithful. I met someone who made me laugh ... one thing led  to another.’

They had sex in a shower and more sex in the bedroom. To her dismay and Henry Cecil’s mortification, the story found its way — via a friend in whom she had confided — on to the front page of the News of the World.

The following day, Cecil sacked Kieren Fallon for unspecified ‘personal reasons’, though Fallon denied he was the jockey involved.

As for Natalie, she said: ‘I’ll always
regret it because I had let myself down. I told Henry what had happened
before the article appeared. He was understanding and said: “We do 
these things when we are low.” ’

Henry
Cecil must have been pretty low himself when, some time after this, he 
paid a prostitute called Claire Jacobs £800 to spend the night with him 
at the Grand Hotel in Brighton. And, yes, this also made the front page 
of the News of the World.

Natalie,
fighting her addictions in The Priory clinic in South-West London at 
the time, was shown the newspaper by a fellow patient. Then Henry 
arrived, carrying a teddy and hoping in vain for a reconciliation.

She
had a few words with him — ‘a few loud words’. He issued a statement 
admitting being with Miss Jacobs all night, but denying they ‘had sex’.

Couple: But Cecil divorced second wife Natalie after mutual allegations of infidelity

It
was all so very messy and, for his friends, so disappointing that the 
seamier side of this genial and generous man should overshadow his 
genius with horses.

There 
are various theories about why his career slumped to crisis level after 
the turn of the century, when he slipped out of fashion with some of the
newer owners.

Some say they simply went for younger trainers; others insist Cecil was seen by many as ‘soiled goods’.

His yard, once filled with 200 racehorses, was down to just 50 and he had difficulty making ends meet.

One
important owner stood by him through thick and thin. This was Prince 
Khalid, a highly dignified man.   Among the horses he gave him to train 
was one called Frankel, who turned out to be a wonder horse.

And, in 2011, in the Queen’s Birthday Honours, Henry Cecil was knighted.

Sir
Henry’s climb back to the top began before Frankel, however. Friends 
believe it had much to do with the support of his third wife, Jane, who 
was his secretary before they married five years ago.

So what happened to the others?

First
wife Julie has retired from training and still lives in Newmarket. 
Natalie, who has never confirmed the identity of her one-night-stand 
‘leading jockey’, now lives quietly  in Chelsea.

Kieren
Fallon took legal action against Cecil and in an out-of-court 
settlement is understood to have got £200,000 for loss of earnings. He 
is  still riding.

As for 
that horse Fallon rode that day at Glorious Goodwood when he and Henry 
Cecil stood side by side for the last time — it came nowhere.
