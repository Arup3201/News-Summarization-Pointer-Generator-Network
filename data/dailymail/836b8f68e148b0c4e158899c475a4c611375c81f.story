Nine- year-old Jack Bristow is thought to be one of the youngest men in the world to be diagnosed with testicular cancer 

A boy of nine has been diagnosed with testicular cancer – making him what is believed to be the youngest sufferer in the world.

Jack Bristow has had to have his right testicle removed and has undergone two rounds of chemotherapy, causing his hair to fall out.

The diagnosis came after the youngster’s right testicle began to swell in September last year when he took a blow to his groin while playing football at school.

Doctors said it was likely to be inflammation and he was prescribed ibuprofen to decrease the swelling. Just weeks later he took another knock to his groin when playing at school and was taken to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital.

It was probably this blow that saved his life. Doctors found his right testicle was significantly larger than his left.

His parents were told he could have a torsion of the testicle – in which a cord becomes twisted and cuts off its blood supply – or it may be dead and could need to be removed.

After doctors concluded it was neither of those, a biopsy was taken and it showed there were abnormal cells. Jack was then transferred to Southampton General Hospital where doctors found he had seminoma, a testicular cancer germ cell tumour.

Medics told the family that Jack was probably the youngest in the UK, and the world, to be diagnosed with the disease.

In the weeks since the diagnosis in December, Jack has had his right testicle removed and had two cycles of chemotherapy. He has also had testicular tubing removed and has had biopsies, ultrasounds and countless blood tests.

Jack, pictured with his parents Joanne and Dan, was diagnosed in December after visiting doctors complaining of a swollen right testicle. He has since had his testicle removed and has faced two rounds of chemotherapy, causing his hair to fall out. His father, in a show of solidarity, has shaved his head

Jack and his family are raising money for the hospital ward where he was treated. Doctors told his parents the cancer is 'treatable', giving them hope

His mother, Joanne, 29, of Basingstoke in Hampshire, said: ‘I can’t even begin to describe how we felt. I thought I had felt heartache before but that nearly killed me. Jack is taking it all a whole lot better than we thought he would – it’s probably affected us more than him.’

Father Dan, 32, added: ‘The doctors think he is the youngest to have it but said it is one of the most treatable types of cancer so it fills you with hope. 

'It is thanks to those kicks that we found out he had cancer. If that had not happened we would never have known – it helped save his life.’

Cancer of the testicles most commonly affects men aged 15 to 45, with around 2,200 cases diagnosed each year.

Around 47 per cent of men diagnosed with the disease will be under 35 years old.

Despite it being a relatively rare form of cancer, it is one of the more treatable.

If caught at an early stage, men can expect a high cure rate with 98 per cent of sufferers disease-free a year after treatment.

If caught at any stage, 96 per cent of men will still be alive 10 years after their treatment.

Unlike many cancers, there are few known risk factors for testicular cancer.

Men born with an undescended testicle, are at a slightly greater risk. Around 10 per cent of sufferers will have a history of this condition.

Having a brother or father affected by testicular cancer can also increase a man's risk.

Some research has suggested the disease is slightly more common in men with fertility problems and men with HIV are more likely to develop testicular cancer.

Signs and symptoms include:

His parents have been told that the treatment has a 95 per cent success rate. Jack said: ‘It doesn’t really feel like I have cancer. 

'Sometimes it’s really painful but sometimes it’s okay. I’m not a fan of needles though. My friends have all been really supportive.’

Dr Alan Worsley, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Only a handful of children are diagnosed each year in the UK with testicular cancer. The good news is that, thanks to research into better treatments, most patients diagnosed with testicular cancer survive.’

The family, which also includes his seven-year-old brother Alfie, are now fundraising for the Piam Brown Children’s ward at Southampton General Hospital, where Jack goes for treatment.
