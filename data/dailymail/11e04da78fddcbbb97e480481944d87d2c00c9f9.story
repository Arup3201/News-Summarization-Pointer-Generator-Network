Arsenal forward Joel Campbell has admitted he is in awe of his team-mate Santi Cazorla's technical ability and hopes to learn plenty from the Spain international.

The 22-year-old, who impressed for Costa Rica at the World Cup, says the quality Cazorla can produce on either foot is simply exceptional.

He told Arsenal Player: 'I must say that Santi Cazorla has some exceptional technical skills. He can take corners or free-kicks equally with his right or left foot.

Talented: Joel Campbell is hoping to forge a place in Arsenal's first team after impressing in pre-season

In awe: Campbell has admitted Santi Cazorla's technical ability is simply astonishing 

'That's some technique! That is a very unusual thing to see and it has left me astonished.'

Campbell hopes to forge himself into Arsene Wenger's plans in the near future, but knows he has a fight on his hands with the plethora of attacking options available at the club.

Up and coming: Campbell will be hoping to replicate his promising international form on the club stage

He added: 'I am my biggest competitor - I have to train hard and get better day after day. Being here is a great opportunity for me.

'I feel that I can contribute with speed, goals and dribbling skills. I am a player capable of playing either on the right or left flanks or in the middle.

'It's down to the manager to decide which of those three positions I am needed most in. I just have to do my best anywhere I play.'
