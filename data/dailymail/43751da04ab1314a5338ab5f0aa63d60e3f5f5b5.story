Convicted rapist Ched Evans was conspicuous by his absence again when he did not turn up at Sheffield United's training ground on Thursday.

The striker's former club revealed this week they would allow the ex-Wales international to train with them after serving half of a five-year prison sentence.

Evans was pictured on Thursday with fiancee Natasha Massey with sports gear on outside their Cheshire home.

The controversial decision has attracted fierce criticism in the media and from the general public, while club sponsors also appear unhappy with the move. 

Evans was not seen at the club's academy headquarters on Thursday, and nor were most of the Blades' senior players or staff following Wednesday night's Johnstone's Paint Trophy defeat at Walsall.

Evans spent two and a half years in prison after being convicted in April 2012 of raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl.
