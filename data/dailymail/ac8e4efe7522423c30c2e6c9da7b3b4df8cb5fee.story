The last-but-one trophy Tottenham won was the League Cup of 1999, with Allan Nielsen snatching an injury-time header for a 1-0 win over Leicester.

Aside from Emile Heskey, then a young Fox and now a 37-year-old on a revival tour at Bolton, the cast of players from both sides are mostly managers, coaches or pundits.

They include Kasey Keller, Neil Lennon, Robbie Savage and Tony Cottee from Leicester’s starting XI, and Sol Campbell, Justin Edinburgh, Les Ferdinand and David Ginola of Spurs.

And then there is Tottenham’s Swiss centre-half that day, Ramon Vega, who took the route less travelled for a former footballer, and went from the dressing room to hedge funds and asset management.

In a 13-year professional playing career that ended in 2003, Vega did well financially for the era, playing at Grasshoppers, Cagliari and Spurs among others. ‘My top salary as a player was around £15,000 per week, at Tottenham, at a time when the best-paid players were on perhaps £25,000 a week,’ he told the Mail on Sunday.

But it was his post-playing days when he really struck it rich. Having earned single-digit millions in total as a player, he has since banked around £15 million from asset management ... and counting.

‘The risks in business are bigger than in football, and the rewards can be likewise,’ he says. ‘My second career has definitely been more risky. As a footballer you’re an employee. You play. You get paid.

‘As a businessman you take risks. Your investment can go up. Or it can crash and you lose everything.’

He cites the 1999 League Cup win, played on painkillers because of a stress fracture in his ankle, as a career high. ‘The whole day was off the dial,’ he recalls. ‘Painful, so painful. But sport is about winning and it was a brilliant occasion. The Spurs fans were just fantastic.’

His other football career highlights were winning a Treble in Scotland with Celtic in a brief stay in the 2000-01 season, and playing for Switzerland in a draw against hosts England at Wembley Stadium in the opening game of Euro 96. He had been called up years earlier by a former Swiss national manager, Roy Hodgson.

Having earned a degree in business administration and finance from Zurich Business School while still a young player, he co-founded his first asset management firm, the Duet Group, in the final year of his playing career. He sold his stake for millions a few years later and now has interests in various companies including Vega Swiss Asset Management - which has around $1 billion of investor funds under management - and a new venture, From Pitch to Boardroom (FPTB).

‘With FPTB I’ll be combining my passion of football and my background in business to help other businesses succeed,’ he says. In essence, FPTB will offer consultancy services and management tools to corporations.

Vega believes Daniel Levy is an astute man but claims Tottenham still haven't reached their potential

Vega believes English football could be much better run, and that with the top club’s ever-growing riches, they should be doing better on the pitch at continental level, Spurs included.

‘Daniel Levy is an astute man and he’s getting there but the club still hasn’t reached its potential,’ Vega says. He adds that football is an industry like no other. ‘In manufacturing for example, if your product is crap you can change it relatively simply and take it back to market,’ he says. ‘In football it’s the same principle but it’s nowhere near as quick and easy.’

He thinks in the short-term, Spurs have a realistic shot of glory in this weekend’s final.

‘The players are finally starting to catch up with the philosophy of Mauricio Pochettino,’ he says. ‘Of course Chelsea are strong, terrific, and Jose Mourinho will prepare them brilliantly.

‘But this is a one-off. Spurs will go out there under less pressure. I think they’ll win, 2-1, maybe 3-1, with Harry Kane scoring.’

If his prediction comes off, he won’t be the only one partying like it’s 1999.
