Face to face for the very first time with the man who had killed her son, Donna Holcomb was not gripped by anger in the Indianapolis court, but by overwhelming sadness.

Because as she stared at Marvin Carter, 20, at his August 2012 bond hearing, it dawned on Methodist minister Holcomb that the young man who mowed down her son in a hit and run felt exactly the same way.

But what neither of them knew at that moment was that they were to embark on a powerful journey of forgiveness that would eventually lead to Carter coming to call Holcomb 'mom'

Salvation: Marvin Carter, 21, was imprisoned for
 the July 12th, 2012 fatal motorcycle accident in Downtown Indianapolis 
which killed Michael Holcomb and was offered forgiveness by his mother 
Donna Holcomb

Carter was sentenced to two years in prison in November for the July 12th incident in Indianapolis, which left motorcyclist Michael Holcomb, 36, fatally wounded on the road.

He still remembers the words of Halcomb's father, Michael Sr. as he told him, 'You were at the scene of the accident and you basically left my son there to rot and die.'

As the judge ordered him to spend the next two years behind bars, Donna Holcomb broke down in tears on the witness stand.

But as she held up a picture of her son and his dog Brody, she noticed that Carter too, had broken down.

During the trial she learned that Carter had been in and out of foster care and had little contact with the criminal justice system.

She heard how he cared for his dying mother when he came out of care at the age of 16 and how two weeks before his 18th birthday she died from a heart attack with Carter by her side.

His sister told the court that her brother was the victim of a terrible childhood in care and suffered physical and sexual abuse.

Holcomb told the Indystar.com that Carter's world, was one she has 'never been familiar with.'

'I’ve never been a young, black, underprivileged individual in the inner city,' she said.

'This situation opened my eyes and world to something I’ve never experienced. I began to really understand and realize the need and the opportunity to, maybe, just help one person. Maybe.'

However, what occurred at his sentencing stunned Carter as Donna Holcomb walked over and said that she would like to stay in contact with him while he served his sentence.

She said that it was her wish to help him get back on his feet.

'I was kind of shocked,' said Carter to the Indystar.com

'I didn’t really understand why somebody would want to stay in contact with me. I thought it was kind of weird.'

However, as Carter was being led out, Halcomb said, 'I'll talk to you like a mama, is that OK?'

'Yes ma'am,' replied Carter.

Just three days later, the victim's advocate at the Marion County Prosecutor's Office received an email from Halcomb asking how to write letters to Carter.

'The true remorse that Marvin displayed that day was heartbreaking for everyone there,' she wrote.

'You can’t fake what he went through. .. This young man has lived through hell growing up and it’s only going to get worse in the DOC.

'And for sure, we want to send Marvin letters of encouragement and support. Someone has to start making a difference in his life so that he can see life is worth living.'

It was on the evening of July 12th that Donna Holcomb's son Michael was riding his motorcycle through Meridan, Indiana when the 36-year-old IT project manager in Indianapolis careered into the car Carter was driving.

Carter had been drinking, upset that his boyfriend had cheated on him and was driving without a license for his friend who did not feel well.

The the immediate aftermath of the crash, Carter pulled over and exited the vehicle to witness Michael Holcomb try to reach for his cellphone as he lay on his back.

Carter told the Indystar.com that for a brief moment their eyes met.

'If I stayed,' Carter said. 'I knew they would lock me up.'

A cross dresser, Carter told the Indystar.com that he was fearful of the consequences for himself in prison.

'I was scared of me being gay,' he said. 'Of somebody raping me or probably just doing something to me.'

So he ran and spent the next six days on the run - playing a game of phone-tag with the police who had tracked him down after they found his friend and the car they drove away from the scene.

Grief stricken by their son's death, Donna Holcomb said that his arrest brought her only relief that he wouldn't do it again.

Indeed, the next day when her son's killer's mugshot appeared on a news website, the emotional impact was small. In fact, the picture caption only read, 'a young black man in a mugshot.'

Holcomb could not have predicted that four months later she would be about to exchange life-changing letters with the young man who killed her son and ran away.

Explaining why she began sending the letters, Holcomb said that she couldn't bear the thought of two lives going to waste.

'My son is dead and somebody else's son is going to be penalized. All of this for nothing,' she explained to Indystar.com

Writing her first letter in December, Holcomb told Carter about her family, about her son Michael.

Two weeks later she received the first apologetic reply from Carter.

'If I could give my life and bring your son back, I would,' wrote Carter to Holcomb.

Encouraging him to spend his time behind bars gaining a high school diploma, Holcomb even sent Carter a photograph of her family from Christmas.

'It might be really hard for you to understand that someone you don’t know can care, but we do and we want you to know that,' wrote Holcomb.

As Carter slowly opened up, he told Holcomb about his abusive childhood and of his dreams to be a model.

And then Carter asked her if she would mind terribly if he called her 'Mom'.

'It feels like you are more like my mom than anyone I’ve known since my mom died,' Holcomb recalled Carter saying in one of his letters to the Indystar.com

'I feel like I can call you Mom.'

In fact, Holcomb now signs off her letters as 'Mamma Donna', which is what her dead son used to call her.

In February, Carter was visited by Holcomb and even pays a little money into his prison account so that he can buy snacks and toiletries.

When he is released next May, Donna and Michael Holcomb Sr. hope to set up job training for Carter.

'I hope and pray that the bond we have formed helps him in some way to see himself as a valuable human being and that someone loves and cares for him versus the world taking advantage of him,' Donna Holcomb said.
