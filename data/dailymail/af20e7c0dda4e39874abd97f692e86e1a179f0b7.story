The Dallas Cowboys have called one of their former players back out of retirement and in return he is giving away his $53,000 gameday paycheck.

Jon Kitna played for the Texan team for two years starting in 2009 but retired in January of 2012.

From there he returned to his hometown of Tacoma, Washington and became a high school math teacher and the coach of the football team.

When his former teammate, quarterback Tony Romo suffered from a back injury that will leave him out of the much anticipated game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday that decides who heads to the playoffs, Kitna texted his old coach and said that he would be happy to help.

Back in the game: Jon Kitna played for the Dallas Cowboys for two years (seen here at a November 2010 game) but retired in January 2012 and now he is going back to play on Sunday to fill in for Tony Romo

'I told Jason (Garrett) if he wants me or somebody to come in and call a play and be able to pull a play off if a bad situation happened, I would be willing to do that,' Kitna told The Dallas Morning News about his communication with the coach.

Garrett was clearly in a tough spot because with Romo's injury, the fate of the game would likely fall to Kyle Orton, who has served as Romo's back up for the past two seasons but has not seen much play time.

He also tested out three other possible quarterback substitutes, but after just a 30 minute phone call with his old pal Kitna, Garrett agreed to put him back in the game.

Kitna, 41, is expected to serve as back up for Orton during the game on Sunday.

'So he’s a very active guy. He’s a 
mentally tough guy... And he’s certainly very young at heart. So it was 
good to have him back, good to have him back in the meetings, and (I’m) 
excited to see him practice today,' Garrett told the paper.

Even
 though he is getting back into the game, Kitna isn't forgetting the new
 band of teammates he leads in Washington, as he agreed to donate his 
earnings from Sunday's game to the school where he was teaching.

His new life: Kitna started working as a math teacher at Lincoln High School in his hometown of Tacoma, Washington

Keeping active: Kitna, 41, didn't leave the sport though as he coached the school's football team

Kitna will earn $53,000 for Sunday's game and all of it is going to Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington.

That amount is just shy of the salary of a teacher in the area, as $57,650 is the average annual take home pay for a teacher at a Tacoma public high school.

Kitna is a father of four and his eldest son Jordan was unable to play for his father's team last year because they technically lived outside of the school district.
