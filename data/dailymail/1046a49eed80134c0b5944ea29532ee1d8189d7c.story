A 'major' blast has rocked an area around a mosque in the restive northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri.

Four people were reportedly killed in the explosion which happened just after Friday prayers.

Islamist sect Boko Haram - which killed 42 with a series of Christmas Day bombs outside churches - has been blamed. The city is known to be its stronghold.

Blast: A 'major' blast has rocked an area around a mosque in the restive northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri

One resident said: 'There was a loud blast near the mosque just after the Friday prayers as people were trooping out of the mosque.

'Everybody scampered to safety, leading to a stampede.'

Army spokesman Brigadier General Isa initially blamed Boko Haram for the attack, but it is not yet known if and why it would attack a mosque.

Boko Haram is suspected of having links to Al Qaeda and is believed to want to impose Islamic Sharia law in Nigeria.

Nigeria's 160 million people are roughly divided between Muslims and Christians, who mostly live side by side in peace.

Boko Haram claimed three bomb attacks on churches on Christmas Sunday, including one that killed 27 worshippers in a Catholic church just outside the capital Abuja, and one in Jos without fatal victims.

The coordinated strikes by the northern-based Islamist group, whose name translates as Western Education Is Sinful in the Hausa language of the region, appeared aimed at prising open Nigeria's religious faultline in a direct challenge to the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian southerner.   

'Boko Haram is seeking to provoke retaliatory attacks on Muslims in predominantly Christian parts of the country,' said former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell.

The attacks have led local Muslims to be wary of a possible Christian backlash.

'We are just beginning to live in peace, so we hope our Christian brothers can help us keep that peace,' said Mohammed Kabir, who like many Nigerian Muslims said he resented being associated with violent extremism.
