England's population is up 565,000 in the past three years because of a fresh influx of migrants, experts said yesterday. 

The migrant population in England is estimated to have increased by more than half a million in three years, research from the University of Oxford has revealed.

Around two thirds of the 565,000 migrants thought to have come to the country between 2011 and 2014 were born in other EU countries, the study by the university's Migration Observatory said.

Today the former head of the European Commission taunted David Cameron over this issue and said it was 'impossible' for Britain to reverse the trend.

Picture of Britain: England's population is up 565,000 in three years just because migrants. Here is a regional picture of the total foreign population of England and the percentage it has risen in since 2011

Jose Manuel Barroso said: ‘When you have 28 countries it will be impossible to say, let’s say, the French can come to Britain to work in the City but the Poles cannot come to Britain – this is not possible. This will be a violation of the principles of no discrimination.

‘Having said that, the European Union is very much aware that there is the abuse of social benefits. If you have not the means to be in the country, you cannot go there just to benefit from the social security.

‘But you have the right, if you are a citizen of a European country to go to another country to establish there.’

Poland is trying to call its skilled workers home from Britain.

Ambassador Witold Sobkow said it cannot afford to lose its best young people and wants to persuade them to return.

The Polish authorities also hope EU freedom of movement rules will encourage other Europeans to look for jobs in the country, boosting its economy.

Mr Sobkow said efforts were under way to bring back some of the millions of young Poles who left for Britain and after Poland joined the EU in 2004.

He told BBC Radio Four: ‘We have a special programme called Returns and the government is trying to attract these people back home.

‘We are worried that we may lose some well-educated people, and also skilled workers, because we need them.’ But he added: ‘We have other nationalities in Poland ... so this is a kind of free movement of brains.’

Plea: Witold Sobkow

He said as long as the principle of freedom of movement is not called into question, a deal can be reached to restrict migrants’ benefits.

The majority moved to London and the south-east but the north-east and Yorkshire and Humber saw the biggest percentage increases, figures show. 

Every council area of England has seen an increased migrant population, it was said. 

Researchers, who stressed that the numbers are estimates, said the projections give a more up-to-date picture of the migrant populations across England than the 2011 census.

It came as the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that rising number of migrants has led to council services spending by being cut in half - and those with highest migration numbers were hit hardest. 

Official estimates on population are expected in June from the Office for National Statistics.

The greatest increase in the number of foreign-born residents has been in the capital.

Almost 200,000 more migrants were estimated to live in London last year, compared to 2011.

The South East saw the second-highest rise of 79,000, while the smallest increase was in the North East where an extra 26,000 migrants are thought to have arrived since 2011.

Madeleine Sumption, Director of the Migration Observatory, said the study was done to provide more insight ahead of the general election.

'These data show how different local experiences of migration have been across the UK,' she said.

'There are large variations in the size of migrant populations, as well as the share that come from EU countries.

Figures: The study shows how all regions have seen thousands more migrants from within the EU since 2011

Embarrassing: Despite pledges from David Cameron thousands of migrants from outside the EU also came to England

'We have undertaken this analysis to provide a resource for anyone looking to understand local demographics of migration in the run-up to the general election.'

The news piles more pressure on David Cameron, whose promise to curb immigration has been shattered, 

Last week it emerged annual net migration – the measure of how many people have come into Britain minus those who have left – has reached nearly 300,000 - a record.

When he took power in 2010 Mr Cameron pledged to bring this politically sensitive figure below 100,000. 

A total of 624,000 people migrated to Britain in the 12 months up to last September while 327,000 left. The inflow is up 94,000 on the year before.

Official figures: Last year 300,000 migrants arrived in Britain, with 190,000 of them travelled from outside the EU

Net migration from the EU hit 162,000 in the year ending September 2014, up from 130,000 in the previous year

A total of 37,000 Romanian and Bulgarian arrived in the UK, up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months
