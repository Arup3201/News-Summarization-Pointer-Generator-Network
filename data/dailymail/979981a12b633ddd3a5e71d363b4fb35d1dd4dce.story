Ched Evans was released from jail in the early hours of Friday armed with some new skills that might come in handy should football decide against giving him a second chance.

In the two and a half years the former Sheffield United striker has spent in Wymott Prison, a Category C facility for sex offenders in Lancashire, he has performed various jobs.

He was a painter and decorator for a while, and also worked in the prison gymnasium — a role that enabled him to stay fit and be as ready as he possibly can for a return to professional sport.

Family and friends arrived at Evans' mother's house in North Wales following his release on Friday

That, of course, is the intention of the 25-year-old Wales striker and it seems to be the intention of Sheffield United to facilitate that return.

Publicly, the League One club say they are still wrestling with the moral dilemma of having a convicted rapist in their team. Their co-chairman, Jim Phipps, has said they are ‘puzzling’ through the problem and will not necessarily reach a decision any time soon.

Nigel Clough, their manager, said this week that he would leave the decision to his employers. The club spokesman offers no comment, neither do members of the official supporters’ club on an issue that divides the fanbase. This newspaper called two members of the supporters’ club on Friday, one of whom was a woman. Both refused to comment and hung up.

These, of course, are innocent people. They did not rape a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room near Rhyl in May 2011. But they might be interested to know that there is a desire among the hierarchy at Bramall Lane to see Evans return to the club.

It might not be an opinion held by everyone but it is one shared by certain individuals in positions of power.

Indeed, officials have even been heard to echo the view being expressed by Evans’s family and his supporters that he was wrongly convicted by a jury in Caernarfon Crown Court on April 20, 2012.

Of course, nobody will admit to that at the moment. Earlier this week a club spokesman refused to comment on the fact they continued to pay Evans’s £20,000-a-week wages for more than three months after he was jailed.

They might have released him at the end of a contract that expired on June 30, but they chose not to sack him even though a criminal conviction surely amounted to gross misconduct.

The evidence suggests the club have far from deserted a 25-year-old who has scored 48 goals in 113 games for them, including 35 in 42 games during the 2011-12 campaign that was suddenly brought to a premature end.

This is a player, remember, who has been capped 13 times by Wales and cost £3million when the Blades bought him from Manchester City in July 2009.

There is the fact that Clough and co-owner Kevin McCabe visited Evans in jail in April, reportedly to invite him back to training on his release.

And there is a suggestion dialogue has continued throughout his imprisonment between Evans’s family and his representatives and the club. Despite numerous attempts to contact him, McCabe has been unavailable for comment this week.

This would explain why no effort appears to have been made to secure Evans employment elsewhere. His name has not been touted around to clubs in desperate need of a decent striker.

Presumably this is because his family are as confident of seeing him return to Bramall Lane as they appear to be of having his conviction overturned.

His case was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London in November 2012, but now Evans, who plans to issue a video statement next week, will take his case to the Criminal Cases Review Conviction with a legal team employed by his girlfriend’s millionaire father.

Beyond the 150,000 people who have put their names to a petition opposed to seeing Evans return to professional football, plenty have had their say. While leading voices within the game believe in the basic principle of giving anyone who has served their sentence a second chance — with PFA boss Gordon Taylor chief among those voices — senior politicians have expressed what is probably a wider-held view.

Former Minister for Sport and Sheffield United fan Richard Caborn does not want Evans back at the club

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, a Sheffield MP, has warned the football club against re-employing a convicted rapist and Richard Caborn added his voice to the debate.

Standing outside Bramall Lane, the former Minister for Sport and Sheffield MP said it would be a ‘sad day for football’ if the player was taken back.

‘It’s a very sad episode, but Ched Evans is a convicted rapist,’ said Caborn, a lifelong Blades fan. ‘I wouldn’t want to see him in a Sheffield United shirt, or that of any other club, until he acknowledges what he did was wrong and indeed shows remorse for his actions. I believe that will give him his pathway back to professional football.’

Right now Sheffield United seem to have adopted a tactic often employed by politicians: gauging the reaction before committing one way or the other.

Curtis Woodhouse, the Sheffield United player turned professional boxer, said: ‘If you pride yourself on being a family club like we do, you can’t have a convicted rapist as your star striker. I don’t want to see Ched Evans back at Sheffield United. Morals over goals.’

On the official Ched Evans website, his supporters insist he is a role model who will ‘make a personal and profound statement by video’ next week. They also continue with their campaign to discredit the victim in that hotel room that night.

In December 2012, Evans’s cousin, Gemma Thomas, was one of nine people ordered to pay the woman £624 for revealing her identity. Thomas called the victim a ‘money-grabbing slut’ and accused her of ‘ruining lives’.

The FA has vowed to crack down on any chants ridiculing Evans’s victim and ‘celebrating’ his crime — if and when his career resumes.

Sport, indeed society, does lack consistency in dealing with these cases. Lee Hughes remains a professional footballer after two serious convictions. He spent three years in jail after causing death by dangerous driving in 2003 and was found guilty of common assault, with a charge of sexual assault dropped, in May 2012. The former West Bromwich Albion striker now plays for Forest Green in the Vanarama Conference.

An incident in December 2008 saw Marlon King sentenced to 18 months in jail after being convicted of sexual assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

For an incident that involved a 20-year-old female student, he was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register for seven years. At the time, Wigan cancelled his contract and King’s appeal against the conviction was unsuccessful. But football clubs had King back, as did the Jamaica national team, with Sheffield United the last club he represented.

When video evidence emerged last month of American football star Ray Rice assaulting his wife in a lift, he was sacked by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL.

But Mike Tyson, like Evans a convicted rapist, has been rehabilitated to such an extent that he has even appeared in a major Hollywood movie. In 2011, almost two decades after his conviction, Tyson was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

Last year, however, the authorities would not grant him access to the UK to promote his autobiography because of his conviction.

When it comes to Evans, the next move rests with Sheffield United.
