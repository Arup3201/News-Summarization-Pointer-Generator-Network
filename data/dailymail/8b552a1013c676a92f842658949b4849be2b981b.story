Sir Alex Ferguson says European managers are divided on the whether the away goals rule should remain part of competitions such as the Champions League and Europa League.

Critics of the rule,  introduced for the 1965-66 Cup-Winners' Cup, meaning goals scored away from home are worth double say it has become counter-productive and unfair in the subsequent half century. 

'There was a bit of a debate about whether it has any significance today,' said Sir Alex Ferguson after a meeting at the elite coaches' forum at UEFA headquarters on Thursday.

Fergie time: Sir Alex Ferguson says European managers are split on the relevance of the away goal rule

Winner: Chelsea lost 3-1 at Parc de Princes but Eden Hazard's goal won them the 2013-14 Champions League quarter final tie against PSG

'Some think it is not as important as it used to be... and the attacking emphasis on the game today means more teams go away from home and win.

'If we go back, say, 30 years, counter-attacking consisted of one or maybe two, players. Today, counter-attacks have players flooding forward in fives or sixes and really positive, quick passing.'

The rule first came into play in a second-round Cup-Winners' Cup tie as Hungarian side Honved went through at the expense of Dukla Prague after they were 4-4 on aggregate after two legs.

At the time it was seen as preferable to having a time-consuming play-off or the arbitrary toss of the coin which was sometimes employed, famously sending Liverpool to the European Cup semi-final in 1965 after two goalless draws against Cologne.

In the early days of European competition, when air travel was far less developed and reliable, an away match was an adventure with visiting teams facing unfamiliar, sometimes hostile, conditions.

Away wins were rare and the new rule was an incentive for visiting teams to come out of their shell - but that is far less of a problem now, as playing conditions in most parts of Europe are pretty much identical and trips abroad no longer carry the air of intimidation they once did.

'What is helping is that the state of the pitches, pitches are fantastic nowadays, so coming out of defence with passes is much easier than it was 30 years ago, and you get a better attitude to counter-attack today than you did 30 years ago,' said Ferguson.

Rather than encouraging visiting teams to attack, the fear of conceding a potentially decisive away goal often makes home teams more cautious and the rule also means that some goals turn out to be worth more than others.

'From a personal point of view, when I was playing at home, I used to say to myself, don't lose a goal,' said Ferguson.

Last year's Champions League saw the away goal scored by Chelsea's Eden Hazard in their 3-1 quarter-final first leg loss to Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes prove the difference in the tie as they won 2-0 at home and went through to the semis.
