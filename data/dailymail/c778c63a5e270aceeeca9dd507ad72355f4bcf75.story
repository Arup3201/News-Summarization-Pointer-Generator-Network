Jose Pozo only made his Premier League debut for Manchester City when he came on as a late substitute in the 4-1 win against Sunderland on Wednesday.

But manager Manuel Pellegrini put his faith in the 18-year-old when he replaced the injured Sergio Aguero in the opening minutes of Saturday's clash with Everton.

Aguero had left the field in tears after appearing to injure his thigh in the second minute of the match at the Etihad and Pozo was unexpectedly thrust into the action.

Pellegrini turned to the Spain youth international ahead of proven Premier League goalscorer Edin Dzeko, to fill the void left by the club's leading scorer.

The talented Pozo was forced to play down comparisons with Barcelona star Lionel Messi earlier in the season after scoring on his first-team debut in a 7-0 win against Sheffield Wednesday in September. 

His performances for Manchester City's youth side have earned him rave reviews but against experienced defenders in Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin it was always going to be a tough ask for the former Real Mardrid youngster.

He struggled to make his mark on the game before being substituted in the 64th minute.

Pozo only made eight passes during his time on the pitch - but did manage to complete them all, and showed his work rate from the front as he recovered possession three times for his side.

While he was a willing runner and showed intelligent movement, particularly when he darted to the near post to meet a low cross, only to see his effort blocked by Distin's outstretched leg, Pozo struggled to impose himself on the first half, which City led 1-0 after Yaya Toure's penalty.

Shortly into the second half Pozo had a chance to double the home side's lead, but was thwarted by the legs of Tim Howard in the Everton goal.

The diminutive star cleverly made space for himself in the box and was picked out James Milner's pinpoint cut-back from the City left.

Pozo made a good contact with the first time shot from 12 yards, but Howard's reactions were equal to the strike.

The missed opportunity was to be the forward's last involvement in the game.

With Everton building second-half momentum, thanks largely to the introduction of Ross Barkley, Pellegrini opted to replace Pozo with the more experienced and bigger framed Dzeko. 

The Bosnian's introduction allowed City to hold possession up front and bring the likes of Samir Nasri and Yaya Toure in to play, as he did when he set up Milner superbly with a cushioned header, only for the midfielder to lash his strike high and wide.

While Pozo showed glimpses of his talents with his intelligent movement, a Premier League clash against a very good Everton team looked a step too far for the 18-year-old.
