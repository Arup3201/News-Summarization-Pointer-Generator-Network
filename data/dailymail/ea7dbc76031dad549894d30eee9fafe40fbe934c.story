A man who brought two women home from a Manhattan nightclub has been robbed after allegedly being drugged.

Michael Curreri took the two unidentified woman back to his apartment near Gramercy Park last weekend after a night at Tao, a restaurant and nightclub in midtown, on Saturday.

The New York Post reports that Curreri, 23, told the police that after arriving at his apartment at around 1am, the women stripped off their clothes and took a shower with him when they arrived at his apartment.

Expensive goods: A $10,000 Rolex and $800 sunglasses were taken from Curreri's apartment by the two unidentified women after he was reportedly drugged

Then one of the unidentified women made him a cocktail, and he does not remember anything after that.

His Mac laptop, his $10,000 Rolex watch, a $2,000 passport holder, an iPhone, and an $800 pair of sunglasses were all gone when he woke up.

'I’m sure that’s not how he expected the night would end. If it’s too good to be true, it probably (isn’t),' an unidentified source told The Post. 

Little is known about the 23-year-old other than the fact that he graduated from George Washington University in 2012 and reportedly worked as an intern for the United Nations.

On the case: Police say that this type of crime is unfortunately frequent, and unlike Currceri (pictured), many victims don't come forward

No leads: Curreri's brother (not pictured) was in the apartment at the time of the robbery but did not hear anything

His Instagram and Facebook accounts 
were public briefly before he shut them down, and he was seen posing in 
photos with Porsche cars.

 and his two new 'friends' were not the only ones in the apartment on 
19th Street and 3rd Avenue at the time of the incident.

His brother William was reportedly sleeping in the apartment at the same time and did not hear anything.

He wasn't left completely out of the incident, however, since the women reportedly made off with his iPhone as well.

Where they met: Tao is a popular restaurant with a well-attended bar in midtown where Curreri met the women

'These cases are very common in Manhattan. What usually happens is the victim— the man— is drinking at a bar and picks up a call girl. He gets drunk and brings her back to his apartment,' an unidentified law enforcement source told The Post.

'It’s very embarrassing for the victim so in some cases he won’t report it, particularly if he’s married.'

The case is still open but there is very little information to go on.

One of the women was white and the other was black, both had long hair and both weighed between 115 and 120 pounds.

The investigators said that there is no indication that they were prostitutes.
