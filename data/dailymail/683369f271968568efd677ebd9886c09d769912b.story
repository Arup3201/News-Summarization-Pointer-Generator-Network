Peering through a wire fence, this group of African American children stare out longingly at a fun fair just out of reach in one of a series of stunning photographs depicting the racial divides which split the United States of America.

The image, entitled 'Outside Looking In' was captured by photographer Gordon Parks and was taken as part of a photo essay illustrating the lives of a Southern family living under the tyranny of Jim Crow segregation.

Parks' pictures, which first appeared in Life Magazine in 1956 under the title 'The Restraints: Open and Hidden', have been reprinted byÂ Steidl for a book featuring the collective works of the artist, who died in 2006.

The vivid color images focused on the extended family of Mr and Mrs Albert Thornton who lived in Mobile, Alabama during segregation in the Southern states.

In another photograph, taken inside an airline terminal in Atlanta, Georgia, an African American maid can be seen clutching onto a young baby, as a white woman watches on - a single seat with a teddy bear on it dividing them.

Many white families hired black maids to care for their children, clean their homes, and cook their food.

Controversial rules, dubbed the Jim Crow laws meant that all public facilities in the Southern states of the former Confederacy had to be segregated.

The laws, which were enacted between 1876 and 1965 were intended to give African Americans a 'separate but equal' status, although in practice lead to conditions that were inferior to those enjoyed by white people.
