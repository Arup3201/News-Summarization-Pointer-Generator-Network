A rowdy drinker who was asked to leave a bar came back and threw beer bottles filled with gasoline at its owner.

Christopher Colosimo, 42, was asked to leave the Cagney's Saloon in Davie, Florida, on Monday morning.

The man returned with a makeshift petrol bomb in two bottles - sometimes referred to as a Molotov cocktail.

Colosimo, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, set light to his creations before hurling them at the bar's owner, who was outside at the time.

The owner and none of those drinking inside were injured.

Davie Police Captain Dale Engle told the Orlando Sentinel: 'They kick him out, he gets upset, he leaves. He comes back with two beer bottles filled with gasoline.'

When police arrived at the scene, they found a drunken Colosimo outside the bar.

As he was arrested, he threw a punch at an officer, hitting him in the chest, before kicking a dent into a police car.

He then tried to run from officers - who managed to finally restrain him by using pepper spray.

The man smashed his head against a protective pane in the police car and attempted to smash a window while he was being held in the police station.

In court: The man appeared before Judge Lisa Porter in court and was charged with a string of offences, including firs-degree arson

He was held without bail and warned not to visit the bar.
