American hero: John McCain has paid tribute to legendary Vietnam War veteran Colonel Bud Day, who died on Saturday at the age of 88

John McCain paid an emotional tribute 
to his Vietnam POW cellmate yesterday, telling the Senate how Colonel 
George 'Bud' Day had 'ordered me back to life'.

Colonel Day, who survived five and a 
half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, some of it alongside Senator
McCain, died on Saturday at the age of 88 in Shalimar, Florida.

'I will see him again. I know I will,'
said the Arizona Senator, filled with emotion as he described how he 
imagined Colonel Day's vision of heaven in an Iowa cornfield filled with
pheasants.

'I'll hunt the field with him and I look forward to it,' CNN reported Senator McCain as saying.

Both men shared a cell as prisoners of
war in North Vietnam's notorious 'Hanoi Hilton' after McCain, a Navy 
airman, was shot down while on a bombing raid over the city.

Senator McCain told how Colonel Day, a fierce resistor, showed him 'how to save my self-respect and my honour'.

Together with a third cellmate, Major Norris Overly, Colonel Day had helped nurse the seriously injured McCain back to health.

'They bathed me, fed me, nursed me, encouraged me and ordered me back to life,' he told colleagues in the Senate.

Throughout his 35 years in the military, Colonel Day fought in three conflicts and earned 70 medals making him one of the most decorated American servicemen.

The greatest test of his strength happened while fighting in the Air Force during the Vietnam War.

On August 26, 1967 he was sent on a 
mission to fly 20 miles into North Vietnamese territory to knock out a 
surface-to-air missile site.

He was about 10 miles from the border when his F-100 plane was hit with anti-aircraft fire.

Colonel Day was badly injured after ejecting from the plane, suffering eye and back injuries. On the ground, he was immediately captured.

Courage: Colonel Day spent over five and a half years imprisoned by the Viet Cong. He was imprisoned alongside future Senator John McCain at the infamous 'Hanoi Hilton'

Miraculously he was able to escape five days later and travel barefoot back into South Vietnam.

Two weeks later, just as he was nearing a Marine outpost, a Communist patrol spotted him and he was captured again.

For
the next five and a half years he would be taken from prison camp to 
prison camp as the North Vietnamese pried the fighter pilot for American
military 
secrets, but he only ever supplied false information.

Later,
Colonel Day would describe his years as a prisoner to the AP as 'a major issue in
my life, and one that I am extremely proud of. I was just living day to
day.'

Senator McCain
was also captured by the Viet Cong in 1967, and wasn't released until 1973. 
For two years Senator McCain was held in solitary confinement.

Reflecting
on their time together in his memoir 'Faith of My Fathers,' Senator McCain said
that Colonel Day 'was a tough man, a fierce resister, whose example was
an inspiration to every man who served with him.'

In a Twitter post Sunday, Senator McCain called Colonel Day 'my friend, my leader, my inspiration.'

During his imprisonment, Colonel Day participated in a show of resistance by joining other prisoners in singing 
'The Star-Spangled Banner' while guards pointed guns at them.

Colonel
Day was released on March 14, 1973 and three years later he was awarded
the Medal of Honor by President Gerald Ford for his courage in
enemy captivity.

'Colonel
Day was totally debilitated and unable to perform even the simplest 
task for himself,' his award citation read. 'Despite his many injuries 
he continued to offer maximum resistance. His personal bravery in the 
face of deadly enemy pressure was significant in saving the lives of 
fellow aviators who were still flying against the enemy.'

Colonel Day was born on February 24, 1925 in Sioux City, Iowa.

He
started his military career early when he quit high school to join the 
Marines in 1942, serving in the Pacific theatre during World War II.

Honorable: Throughout his decades-long military career Colonel Day would amass 70 award medals - 50 of them for combat exploits

After
the war he returned home to finish his education, graduating from Morningside College in Sioux City and going onto receive a law degree from the University of South Dakota.

After
receiving an officer's commission, Colonel Day was transferred to the 
Air Force Reserve and recalled to active duty in 1951 to fight in the 
Korean War.

Colonel 
Day decided to stay in the military after Korea. When he returned home 
from Vietnam, Colonel Day served as a vice commander at Eglin Air Force 
Base in Florida.

He retired from the military in 1977 and transitioned into the civilian sector to practice law in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.

Never
forgetting the time the two spent in Vietnam, Colonel Day would 
campaign for McCain during the senator's two bids for president.

Colonel Day is survived by his wife, four children and 14 grandchildren.
