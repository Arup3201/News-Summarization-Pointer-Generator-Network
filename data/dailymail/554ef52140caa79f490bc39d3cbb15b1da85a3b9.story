Burger King is accused of bullying a veteran who bit into a needle-laced burger and sued after he was hospitalized.

Clarke Bartholomew, 46, says he was stationed in Hawaii in 2010 when he bit into a Triple Stacker laced with needles that pierced his tongue and got stuck in his intestine.

Now an attorney for the Miami-based fast food company wants the case thrown out and lawyer fees paid because Bartholomew did not attend a September 10 meeting in Honolulu to discuss settlement terms.

Service: Clarke Bartholomew is at odds with Burger King over a lawsuit for a burger laced with needles

Bartholomew said in a court filing this week he could not attend the meeting because he recently began a new job in Virginia, where he lives after his medical retirement from the Army.

'Since I was a new employee, I had no time on the books to take time off to fly from Virginia to Hawaii, for the settlement conference,' said Bartholomew, now a U.S. Parks Police dispatcher.

His lawyers have shot back that Burger King is 'bullying a represented opponent for not appearing at a settlement conference.'

Attorneys for Bartholomew said in court filings that Burger King violated orders to discuss the settlement and provide written offers before the meeting.

Bartholomew has faced resistance from both Burger King and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the franchise operator.

Grant Kidani, representing Burger King in Honolulu, said the branch is 'totally operated by the government.'

Government lawyers claimed that Bartholomew could not sue because he incurred the injuries during military service.

'Eating a Burger King Triple Whopper (equally available to the military or general public) while at home on a sick day does not implicate military command or discipline,' wrote U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright on allowing the case to continue.
