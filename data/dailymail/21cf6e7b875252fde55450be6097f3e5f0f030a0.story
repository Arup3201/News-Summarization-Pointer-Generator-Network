High school students have paid tribute to a mother-of-three who was allegedly killed by her husband in the front yard of their south-west Sydney home.

Zoran Crnobrnja, 51, is accused of murdering his 49-year-old wife, Vesna, at their Casula home reportedly with a gardening tool on Monday.

More than 50 students streamed up Flame Street on Tuesday and left flowers on the front fence of the home where the tragedy unfolded, 9News reported.

It's estimated around 50 students from a nearby high school marched down Flame Street in tribute

Vesna Crnobrnja's husband Zoran has been charged with murder after she was found outside the couple's south-west Sydney home

The students were classmates of the Crnobrnja's 17-year-old son, according to Seven News.

One student led a touching prayer as others bowed their heads, asking God to 'guide [the couple's children] through this tough time'.

The day after the horrific incident the couple's well-manicured lawn looked eerily untouched and deserted, with a rolled-up newspaper lying on the driveway as the family car sat parked in front of a basketball hoop. 

Earlier on Tuesday, Crnobrnja appeared in Liverpool Court where he did not apply for bail and will next appear in Campbelltown Court on December 3.

Remnants of police tape and a plastic bag left by forensics were strewn near the fence after officers were called to the home about 2.20pm on Monday after reports of a disturbance to find a woman's body in the front yard.

Typically domestic objects were dotted around the front of the house - cans of spray paint, a bucket, and over-flowing wheelie bins.

It comes after chilling CCTV footage emerged showing Crnobrnja talking on his mobile phone and police swooping on the home moments after the alleged murder. 

Crnobrnja can be seen on the street, dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, talking on his phone in CCTV footage captured by a neighbour in the minutes after the alleged murder.

The grainy vision also shows the moment police vehicles arrived at the house before Crnobrnja, who had left the scene following the phone call, returned home.

Crnobrnja was arrested at the scene and later charged with his wife's murder at Liverpool Police Station after an initial delay due to a language barrier.

Police said the death was domestic related and it is believed the couple had an argument while gardening before Vesna's body was found.

'Police have been to the house in the past and the man is known to police,' Detective Inspector Dean Johnson said.

'This appears to be a domestic violence incident.'

The couple have three children, including two adults and a 17-year-old, who were not home at the time of the attack.  

A young neighbour, Emmanuel Nunes, witnessed Ms Crnobrnja's death and is now 'traumatised', The Daily Telegraph reported.

He said the couple had been happily gardening together just moments before the attack.

'I looked around and found him standing over her,' Mr Nunes told the News Corp newspaper.

'They had been happily gardening that morning. I spoke to him moments before and he was calm and happy.

'They had been talking about what ornaments to find for the garden.' 

Initial reports suggested Vesna had been shot dead.
