Manny Pacquiao looked fighting fit as he took part in an open training session in preparation for his bout with Chris Algieri - but he did allow his focus to briefly shift past his title defence in November.

During his trip to Hong Kong, where he is promoting the November 23 fight, Pacquiao responded to a question from one of the fans who mobbed him in the street and revealed he is 'crossing his fingers' he will get his match-up with Floyd Mayweather Jnr in 2015.

The Pacquiao-Mayweather superfight has been touted for years and there have been endless false dawns as to if - and when - it could occur, but it seems the Filipino is keen for the match-up to happen.

Pacquiao told AFP: 'Hopefully that fight (with Mayweather) will happen by next year.

'I'm crossing my fingers that that fight will happen but right now my mind is already set to focus on my next fight but Algieri. I think the time to talk about that issue is after the fight.'

Unbeaten American Mayweather has defeated almost every single potential opponent on the planet and Pacquiao hopes he gets the chance to be the first to take him down before the Filipino hangs up his gloves.

'I'm not thinking yet about retirement,' he said. 'I will continue my boxing career for a couple of years, the journey will continue in my boxing career and we'll see what happens.'

In the meantime, Pacquiao takes on American Algieri in a defence of WBO world welterweight title next month.

And the 35-year-old is determined not to take his opponent lightly.

He continued: 'No, absolutely I'm not taking this fight lightly because I know his hunger and he's young and he wants to win the fight, but I will not let that happen.

'I'm not thinking about the knock-out because it will make me confident and careless.

'If the knock-out comes it will come but my focus is to make sure that 100-per-cent condition and killer instinct is there, the aggressiveness is there, so that's my focus in training.'

The Filipino fighter insisted he was focused on Algieri and will switch attention to Mayweather after the bout
