Panic erupted among passengers on an American Airlines flight last night when it was hit by extreme turbulence that injured six crew members.

Staff working on the flight from Recife in Brazil to Miami were taken to hospital in Florida when their plane landed on Sunday at 6:30pm.

A food trolley smashed a huge hole in the ceiling and a passenger was thrown out of her seat before landing in the gangway, witnesses said.

‘It was a terrible experience,’ passenger Charistianne Menezes told CBS 4. ‘Of course I was sure that I was going to die.’

Gillas Correa was also among the 145 
people on board Flight 980 and said there were people ‘screaming’ and 
‘crying’ after a 'huge drop'.

'There was a woman who was sitting a 
couple rows behind us,’ he told the Miami Herald. ‘She got thrown up in 
the air and landed in the hallway.’

An American Airlines spokesman said six flight attendants were injured 'to some degree' during the flight, which landed safely.

Only staff seem to have been badly 
hurt because they were moving around the cabin when the turbulence hit, 
reported the Miami Herald.

The aircraft landed safely just after 6:30pm last night. The passenger jet was carrying 136 passengers and nine crew members.

The incident happened on the Boeing 757-200 around two hours into the flight and it landed safely around six hours later.

The doctor on board told the pilot that he had stabilised the injured - so it was safe to continue the flight to Florida, reported CBS.

Passengers applauded when it 
eventually touched down. The plane has been taken out of service so it 
can be repaired, reported WSVN.

Touchdown: The landing was at New York's JFK airport (file picture)

A regional passenger plane was forced to make an emergency landing at New York's JFK airport after the pilot saw smoke emerge from the cockpit.

The Pinnacle Airlines flight bound for Lewisburg, West Virginia, sounded its emergency signal on Saturday at 3pm and made a safe landing at JFK.

Pinnacle Airlines has been marred in recent weeks by financial troubles.

It is the parent company of Colgan Airlines, which operated the fatal 2009 flight that killed 50 people when it crashed in Buffalo, New York.
