A group of Russian teenagers has bypassed airport security by sneaking onto a runway and sharing their pictures on social media.

Despite increased security around the world in the aftermath of 9/11, members of the notorious 'roofer movement' scaled security fences, pulled on high-vis jackets, and posed next to and inside aircrafts at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo International Airport.

The group took pictures of themselves in and around various aeroplanes, and then one teen was also snapped in the cockpit of a helicopter.

In a shocking photo, one girl even managed to get into the cockpit of an aircraft

Wearing high-vis vests amde the teenagers look 'slightly' more genuine

They then made their escape the same way they entered.

The photos first appeared on social networking site VK  via user 'Kosta SV,' who also gave a description of his group's actions one evening.

Vocativ reported that Kosta had evidence of similar security breaches in other albums he shared on the website.

The group are thought to be a part of the 'roofer' movement, who take on challenges to breach security at buildings and landmarks in Russia

The pictures released on social media have led to many voicing their concerns at the security breach

'Anyone can walk on the runway,' he writes.

'It may sound funny, but in fact it's dangerous. The helicopters were open, right next to the booth with a guard, perhaps there is generally no security, or they went to drink tea.'

Since the pictures went viral, it has led to many members of the public voicing their concerns over security at Russian airports.

What's more, the group have recently posted a video online that shows them returning to the airport, complete with high-vis jackets, and again making it onto the runway.

The group had plenty of time to capture some special pictures from their trip to the runway

The pranksters left the airport the same way they entered, completely undetected

The group went on to upload a video which shows them returning to the same scene some days later

The group are often pictured scaling various buildings and landmarks in Russia, many of which are supposed to have high security.

There are estimated to be at least 50 serious 'roofers' in Russia, often taking on the challenges posed by buildings in and around Moscow.

They tend to scale buildings without safety equipment - and of course a video camera to snap the moment.
