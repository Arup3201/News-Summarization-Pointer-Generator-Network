Ten years after former world rally champ Colin McRae powered his Ferrari to a podium finish at the Le Mans 24-Hours, Scotland’s most famous Olympian, Sir Chris Hoy, has taken his first strides towards racing in the world’s most gruelling endurance race in 2016.

The 38-year-old, with six Olympic gold medals and 10 World cycling titles already tucked away, has swapped his lycra for a fire-retardent racesuit.

And having pledged to compete at Le Mans in two years, he’s already scorching the Tarmac by racing in this season’s British GT Championship in his Nissan GT-R Nismo GT3.

For Hoy, McRae was something of an inspiration. As a then 19-year-old and having already graduated from BMX racing to sprinting round a velodrome, Hoy - who two years ago made an excellent documentary on the iconic rally figure for BBC - watched the Lanark ace become world champ in 1995.

'Certainly watching Colin in action behind the wheel of a rally car helped create the motorsport bug in me,' Hoy explained during his first, flying visit to the 8.27-mile Le Mans circuit six days ago.'His style was all about action. Colin was so spectacular to watch, flying through the air, landing on one wheel, catching it… how could you not be excited and inspired by that?'

And it was while filming a section of the documentary at Oulton Park that the wheels began to turn seriously in relation to his fledgling motorsport career.

'It’s really all down to Roger Green and Radical sportscars,' Hoy continued.

'During filming at Oulton, we had a few other cars around to make it look like it was a public track day, and Roger was there with Radical.

'He’d been following me on-track - I’d been in my Lotus 211 - and he came in and said, "you’re doing all right round there, ever thought about racing". And I was like, "yeh, I’d love to, but I’ve no idea where to start".

Passion: Hoy is a motor-racing fan and he was a big supporter of Nigel Mansell when he was young

'As it happened, Roger had a novice Radical series he was starting the following year, a one-make series, and he thought it would be perfect for me.'

With a season’s experience under his belt, fate was about to deal Hoy another positive hand.

When Nissan - which is supporting the British Olympic Association and sponsoring Team GB in Rio in 2016 - was looking for an ambassador, they turned to Hoy.

'Aside from the motorsport aspect, I was dead keen to get involved with that anyway,' he explained, 'but then, once on-board, I thought that maybe I could potentially wangle some sort of motorsport opportunity at the same time. And it all just worked out.

'I’m very aware I’m in a position of privilege, because there are so many people who would do anything to be in the position I’m in.

'So I’ve never taken it lightly and just turned up, mucked around and had a laugh. I am having fun, don’t get me wrong, but I’m trying to become a better driver and take it seriously.

'And, of course, it’s not just about me. It’s about every single person in the team who has worked tirelessly to make sure the car’s ready. To make sure that everything’s right about the car’s set-up.

'When I turned up at for the first round at Oulton Park and saw the scale of the British GT operation - the massive trucks; the big motorhomes; the tyre-warmers; the fleet of engineers; the amount of data - that’s when I realised, ‘hey, this is pretty serious’.

'In a way I thought, "right, it’s not just me turning up and going into a novice race series, this is proper championship with a lot of money being spent on it". So I was — and am — determined to do myself justice in being in the car.

'And a. I don’t want to smash the car up and cause damage; and b. I don’t want to pootle around at the back of the grid just larking around. I want to learn from the people around me and show respect to what they do and what they know.

'I’m obviously never going to become a great driver, but I’d like to become a good driver.'

Partnered by NIssan Academy graduate Alex Buncombe in the opening three rounds of the British GT Championship, Hoy - who’s in action again this weekend at Snetterton - has already made an impression with his levels of pace and competitiveness.

'I know I’ve a long way to go, but we’re all working hard to achieve the goal of racing at Le Mans in two years,” he admitted. “It’s hard work, but hard work pays off and I’m determined to be on that grid.'

Glory: Having dominated cycling for so long, Hoy also managed to claim 10 world titles

Pride: Hoy is a proud Brit, as well as a proud Scot, and he is supporting the Glasgow Commonwealth Games

After Snetterton, Hoy’s attentions will turn to Glasgow 2014 and the Commonwealth Games.

I quizzed him on reports that he’d apparently been ‘snubbed’ by the Games’ bosses in charge of the opening and closing ceremonies. Has he been asked?

'Officially I can’t say anything,' he smiled again. 'So read into that what you will. If I was doing something, I couldn’t say anything about it. Let’s put it this way: if I was asked to do anything, it would be a massive honour.'

That, I would suggest, is a sizeable hint that Hoy will have a role to play. And after the Games he can get back to focusing on ensuring his dream to race at Le Mans becomes reality.
