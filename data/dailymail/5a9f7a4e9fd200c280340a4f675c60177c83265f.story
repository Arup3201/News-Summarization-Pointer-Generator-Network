Pilot Peter Siebold, 43, (pictured) was seriously injured and co-pilot Michael Alsbury, 39, killed in the Virgin Galactic crash in the Mojave Desert

The pilot who survived the horrific Virgin Galactic crash has told investigators how he was thrown clear of the spacecraft as it broke up before plummeting nearly ten miles back to Earth.

Peter Siebold, 43, also told the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that he was unaware the feathering system which controls descent had been unlocked early by co-pilot Michael Alsbury.

Mr Alsbury, 39, was killed in the crash in the Mojave Desert in California last month and father-of-two Mr Siebold was seriously injured. 

Giving an update of its investigation today, the NTSB said that the on-scene part of its probe had finished and that the wreckage of the spacecraft had been recovered. 

It is now being stored in a secure location for a follow-up examination.

The NTSB said: 'The NTSB operations and human performance investigators interviewed the surviving pilot on Friday.

'According to the pilot, he was unaware that the feather system had been unlocked early by the co-pilot.

'His description of the vehicle motion was consistent with other data sources in the investigation.

'He stated that he was extracted from the vehicle as a result of the break-up sequence and unbuckled from his seat at some point before the parachute deployed automatically.'

The NTSB said its investigation was continuing.

Mr Siebold, an experienced pilot, blacked out as the craft broke up around him at 50,000ft but was saved by his emergency parachute.

He only regained consciousness halfway into his fall and managed to give a thumbs-up to colleagues in a passing aircraft to show he was alive.

Earlier, he said: 'I must have lost consciousness at first. I can't remember anything about what happened but I must have come to during the fall. 

'I remember waving to the chase plane and giving them the thumbs-up to tell them I was OK. I know it's a miracle I survived.'

The body of Mr Alsbury was found still strapped into his seat on a desert road by construction workers. His parachute did not deploy. 

His wife Michelle said she had 'lost the love of my life'.

Preliminary investigations suggest that the rocket ship’s folding wings – designed to slow it down and achieve safe speeds during landing – deployed early, causing the ship to break up due to the tremendous turbulence around the craft.

Mr Alsbury was trapped in the cockpit but Mr Siebold was thrown clear of the wreckage or somehow unbuckled his seatbelt. He then plunged towards Earth at speeds topping 120mph. 

Hundreds of people have signed up for the Virgin Galactic experience which will take tourists into space.

Virgin Galactic is building a replacement spaceship and says test flights could resume as early as next summer.

Representatives for Virgin Galactic said they were unable to comment on the NTSB investigation or any details surrounding it when contacted by MailOnline.
