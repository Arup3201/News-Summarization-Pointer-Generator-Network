Tragedy: Christine Barrett died after accidentally downing a deadly mixture of alcohol and painkillers

A woman who was plagued for years by 'neighbours from hell' died after accidentally downing a cocktail of drink and drugs to help her cope.

Christine Barrett, 58, who had arthritis in her back, died after washing down her usual dose of painkillers with alcohol to try and block out the noise at the council flat where she lived alone in St Albans, Hertfordshire.

Her sister - who said Ms Barrett had been forced to suffer the anti-social behaviour for at least five years - has claimed the council should have rehoused the 'frightened' secretary, who was taking medication for anxiety and depression.

Ms Barrett's GP, Dr Xanthe Cross, told an inquest her patient had admitted drinking at night time because the noise created by her rowdy neighbours was preventing her from sleeping.

The inquest heard Ms Barrett - who lived on the second floor - was desperate to move to a new home and had told St Albans City and District Council she was struggling to get up the stairs because of her arthritis.

The woman's sister, who did not want to be named, said: 'She sent her medical records to the council but that didn't help. It was like she was forgotten about.

'She was very frightened living there and she got to the stage where she walked round the corner and didn't even want to go in the door.'

She claimed the anti-social behaviour was affecting the lives of other residents of the Bardwell Court flats, as well as her sister.

'Christine was such a houseproud woman but she had given up - it was tragic to see her like that,' she said, adding that the whole family felt the local authority was partly to blame for Ms Barrett's death.

Karen Dragovic, head of housing at the council, said they had offered Ms Barrett an alternative flat earlier this year.

'We were extremely sad to hear of the accidental death of Christine Barrett,' Ms Dragovic said.

'We are aware of anti-social behaviour at Bardwell Court and have been working with residents to take action to deal with this.

'We were also trying to rehouse Christine Barrett and she was offered a move earlier in the year.'

On the night of her death on July 19 
Ms Barrett consumed enough alcohol to render her more than twice the 
drink drive limit. Combined with the painkillers, it caused her to stop 
breathing, the inquest heard.

Hertfordshire coroner Edward Thomas recorded a verdict of accidental death.
