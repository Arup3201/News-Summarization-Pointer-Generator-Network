'I'm no angel, but I've never harmed a soul': Florida truck driver Dicky Joe Jackson (pictured) was jailed for life with no parole for selling meth to help pay for his son's bone marrow transplant

It is a case that could well have inspired the morally ambiguous plot to the hit TV series Breaking Bad.

A father has spoken from his prison cell 18 years into a life sentence with no parole about how he was convicted for selling crystal meth to help pay for his son's life-saving medical treatment.

Florida truck driver Dicky Joe Jackson, now 55, hit out at the harshness of his term, saying: 'I know that what I did was not right or legal, even in a 
life and death situation, as ours was.

'Iâ€™m no angel, but I have never harmed a soul.

'There are people in
 here doing less than me for contract killings and child molestation.'

Jackson was serving his second sentence for drugs offences in 1989 when he learned that his two-year-old son Cole had been diagnosed with an extremely rare autoimmune disease.

Known as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, the condition causes recurrent viral infections, lowers blood platelets and causes suffers to bleed and bruise easily.

Doctors said Cole probably had less than three years to live unless he had a bone marrow transplant.

Luckily his 12-year-old sister, April, was a match - but the operation would cost $250,000 and the family had recently lost their health insurance, he said in an interview with online magazine Salon.

The family managed to raise $50,000 with a huge fundraising campaign that encouraged celebrities including the band Alabama and Ronald Reagan to donate memorabilia for an auction.

They secured a further $50,000 from a children's charity, but then struggled to find the rest.

Dilemma: Jackson's predicament is similar to that facing the fictional Walter White (above), a chemistry teacher who cooks meth to support his family after he's diagnosed with terminal cancer in Breaking Bad

Admitting
 he was 'desperate' and that the ordeal had 'made a crazy person out of 
me', Jackson accepted the offer from a local meth dealer to drive 
payloads of the drug from California to Texas for $5,000 a time.

But a year into the arrangement, in 1995, Jackson was arrested for selling half a pound of meth to an undercover officer.

The judge later found him guilty of 
conspiring to possess, or possessing, with intent to distribute 81.5kg 
of the drug and handed him three life sentences without parole.

He had previously been convicted of possessing half-a-gram of meth, which he would use to keep him awake on long drives, in 1988.

Then a year later, he served a 12-month sentence for transporting a kilogram of cannabis.

Nevertheless,
 some feel he has become a victim of America's draconian drugs laws 
which currently has 3,278 inmates serving life terms with no hope of 
parole, often for relatively minor offences.

His predicament is similar to that facing the fictional Walter White, a chemistry teacher who cooks meth to support his family after he's diagnosed with terminal cancer in Breaking Bad.

Jackson has now exhausted all his appeals and also had a request for clemency from President Barack Obama turned down.

The report does not say what happened to his son.
