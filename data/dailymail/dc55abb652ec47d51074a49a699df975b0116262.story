Zara Phillips and her husband Mike Tindall were spotted enjoying some comfort food after he fell on the finish line on The Jump.

The Queen's granddaughter had joined Mike Tindall in Innsbruck, Austria, for the Channel 4 show, and the couple were seen visiting a kebab shop for a late-night snack after the final.

The former Rugby International came joint second place on the show with athlete Louise Hazel as they lost out to former TOWIE star Joey Essex.

Mike, 36, and Zara, 33, visited the Chili kebab shop in Innsbruck in the early hours after the final and tucked into their greasy meal before heading home holding takeaway boxes.

Zara wore a black fur-lined coat and black heeled ankleboots, while her husband looked more casual in jeans and a green puffer-style jacket.  

The couple, who married in 2011, live on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Estate with their young daughter Mia, born last year.

It was reported last week that they are set to revamp a Grade II listed farmhouse where Zara's father, Captain Mark Phillips, had been living since his divorce from Anne in 1992.

Once a high-tech renovation has been carried out on Aston Farm, set in 600 acres on the Princess Royal’s estate,the young family will move in.

‘The new rooms include a gun room, gym, cinema and games room,’ an insider told Mail on Sundat's Girl About Town.

Mr and Mrs Tindall sold a £1.2 million house in Cheltenham two years ago and moved to a small cottage next to the farm.

Aston Farm has been held in trust for her by family friends, including motor-racing legend Jackie Stewart and her godfather Andrew Parker Bowles, and a spokesman for Zara said last night that the move had been ‘long planned’. 

Trophy: Although Mike was beaten to the Jump crown by  Joey Essex, he seemed happy with his price
