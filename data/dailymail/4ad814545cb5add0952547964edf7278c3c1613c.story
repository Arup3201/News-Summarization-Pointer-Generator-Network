Nearly seven weeks after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down, the pilots of the doomed plane have been laid to rest in special military-style ceremonies.

Draped in a Malaysian flag, the body of Captain Wan Amran was today carried by soldiers into Shah Alam, 15 miles west of Kuala Lumpur, where his family and dozens of mourners gathered to bid him farewell.

Meanwhile, the ashes of Captain Eugene Choo were brought back to his residence in Seremban, around 46 miles from the capital, accompanied by his tearful wife and two sons.

Earlier today, the pilots' remains had 
been repatriated to the country from the Netherlands along with five 
other Malaysians and two Dutch victims of the tragedy, who were of 
Malaysia decent.
