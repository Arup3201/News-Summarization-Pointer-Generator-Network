He showed an appetite for next year’s general election battle with an impassioned speech to the Tory Party conference today.

So what better way to mark his well-received rallying of the troops than a visit to Five Guys American diner in Solihull, West Midlands, with his wife Samantha. 

He posed for pictures at the restaurant - shortly after promising two major tax cuts in his bid for re-election - and told staff the food had been recommended to him by President Barack Obama.

Mr Cameron ordered a hamburger and cheeseburger along with two Budweiser beers and a bottle of water and chatted with diners and staff while he waited for his meal.

The couple spent about half an hour eating their £26.45 meal when they visited at 2pm today, but despite mingling with staff members didn't leave a tip.

Manager Joshua Coelho, 23, said staff and customers were gobsmacked when Mr and Mrs Cameron strolled in.

He said: 'He came in with a couple of minders and was very nice to us all.

It's a high honour to receive the personal recommendation of the U.S. president. 

But then Five Guys has long been a Washington DC favourite and, more recently, is developing a cult following across America.

The company was founded in 1986 in Virginia by Janie and Jerry Murrell and their four sons (with Jerry and the sons being the original Five Guys).

They had a fifth son two years after opening their first restaurant.

Now the sons, Matt, Jim, Chad, Ben and Tyler, are the Five Guys.

They are all involved in the business. Matt and Jim travel the country visiting stores, Chad oversees training, Ben selects the franchisees, and Tyler runs the company's bakery.

After being voted America's favourite burger in 2011, Five Guys' first UK store opened last year in Covent Garden last year.

There are now 13 branches across England, and another four opening soon.

'He had a hamburger "all the way", which means with all the toppings - but he did have onions, jalapenos and mushrooms taken off.

'Sam wasn't as fussy and had a cheeseburger "all the way" with all the toppings and they both had a beer each.'

Mr Coelho added: 'They stayed for about half an hour and he was happy to chat to me. I took his food over to him.

'We don't usually do table service but I thought I'd make an exception for the Prime Minister.

'He told me he wanted to stop off for some real food and that Obama had recommended it to him when he was in the United States.'

The restaurant manager continued: 'He said he had just come straight from the Tory Conference. I asked how his speech went and he said he thought it had gone pretty well.

'He said he really enjoyed the food and posed for pictures with us before he left. He didn't leave a tip though but we didn't really care.

'He was also happy to talk to all of the customers and he was really well received by everybody.

'We tried to leave him to it to enjoy his food - buts it's hard to when the Prime Minister is dining in your restaurant.

'It's not something that really happens every day.'

Other diners took to Twitter after spotting Cameron in the branch, which is based in the Touchwood Shopping Centre and only opened on August 4.

Ryan Wilcox added: 'So David Cameron was in Five Guys in Solihull. Pretty standard.'

The Conservative Party Conference is being held in Birmingham this week, with the Prime Minister delivering his last speech before the election.

He used it to promise those on minimum wage that he would scrap income tax - giving a tax cut to 30 million people - and announced it would increase the 40p tax band to £50,000.

The Prime Minister also vowed to scrap the Human Rights Act, abolish youth unemployment, help more people buy they own home and put immigration at the centre of his battle to claw powers back from Brussels.

And he tore into Labour's 'lie' on the NHS, moving his wife to tears as he spoke about how the service cared for his severely disabled child Ivan.  

Mr Cameron said the Labour party was talking 'rubbish' and spreading 'lies' in a highly-charged attack.
