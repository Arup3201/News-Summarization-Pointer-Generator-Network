This optimistic polar bear's scheme for lunch didn't quite go to plan when he was sprung trying to sneak up on a herd of unsuspecting walruses.

A series of photographs taken by a wildlife photographer in Svalbard, Norway, show the bear stealthily approaching a group of napping walruses.

But when the group's walrus pups sound the alarm, one of the sleeping giants awakes and quickly fends him off. 

The polar bear begins cautiously approaching the herd from a distance while they doze on the beach and in the shallows

Once it gets closer, it begins lumbering towards the herd in the hope it can grab an easy lunch by catching them off guard

However its plan falls apart when the walrus pups panic and begin racing into the water. The remaining on shore pup (circled) was then protected by the adults

After rushing into the water, the walruses turned around to face the polar bear, which seemed confused to have created such panic

The polar bear, now realising it has no chance of successfully taking on the group, beats a hasty retreat in the face of the defensive adults

The remarkable photos show how the bear, spotting the dozing herd of walrus from a distance, begins slowly sneaking towards them along the water line. 

At first, the forty walruses carried on sleeping almost unaffected by his presence. But when the pups begin to panic and start charging into the sea, the adults fight back.

Even for a polar bear, an adult walrus would be a formidable opponent. They can weigh up to 2,000kilograms and have been known to reach lengths of 5metres, and it did not take long before the bear beat a hasty retreat.

A polar bear's diet is made up almost exclusively of seals and the improvised attack that was captured on camera was a major departure from its usual hunting method.

Polar bears are famous for the patient game of hide and seek they play with seals, in which they wait near holes in the ice for a seal to pop up for air.

When the seal sticks its head above the waterline, it's swiped up onto the ice and its skull crushed in one swift bite.

Aftermath: The hungry polar bear sits down after the ordeal to quietly await its next opportunity for a meal
