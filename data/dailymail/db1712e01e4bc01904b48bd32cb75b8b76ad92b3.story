A cancer patient's dying wish was granted recently when his discharge from the Marines was changed from 'undesirable' to 'honorable' after being kicked out in 1956 for being gay.

Since 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' was repealed in 2011, an estimated 114,000 former-soldiers who were discharged from the military for homosexuality are eligible to have their records corrected.

When 79-year-old Hal Faulkner was diagnosed with terminal cancer a year ago, he applied for an honorable discharge but still didn't know if he would live to see the day it was changed.

That's when activist group OutServe-SLDN stepped in. They got Mr Faulkner New York lawyer Anne Brooksher-Yen to represent his case pro bono and the military expedited his request in just two weeks, instead of the normal six weeks to six months.

At a recent ceremony held in his apartment building, two Marines in uniform came to congratulate Mr Faulker and hand him his new discharge papers.

'I don't have much longer to live,' he said as he fought back tears, 'but I shall always remember it.'

Mr Faulkner was kicked out of the military when he was 22, after three years of service.

A fellow soldier whom Mr Faulkner had spent off-duty time with had informed his commanding officer that Hal was gay and the officer believed it and processed the discharge.

But the discharge didn't stop Mr Faulkner from going on to have a successful career, at one point helping to construct Walt Disney World.

It did, however, keep him in the closet for many years and he still attributes his later success to hiding his sexuality.

'I wouldn't be here today. I'd probably be on the street,' he told the New York Times.

Mr Faulkner finally came out to his family in 2005 when he attended a wedding with Charles, his partner of more than 20 years who has since passed away. 

'He's been carrying this societal shame with him all these years,' his niece Michelle Clark said. 'We as a family had no idea the pain he had inside him.'

Fred Sainz of the Human Rights Campaign was on hand for the ceremony and hopes Mr Faulkner's case will lead others to get their records changed.

'What happened today is that a dying man, his dignity was restored,' Mr Sainz told NPR. 'He will die here knowing that he served his country honorably. You certainly can't right the wrong of six decades, [but] you can make it right going forward. And that's what happened today, and that's what we hope will come to thousands of Americans similarly situated.'

The hundreds of thousands undesirably discharged from the military will also be eligible for benefits like VA health care or home loans with an honorable discharge, but that was never the point of the change for Mr Faulkner his lawyer said.

'It was really overwhleming seeing Hall finally have his wrong righted,' she said. 'He is such a wonderful loving man, and he served with honor in the military and it was so important to him.'
