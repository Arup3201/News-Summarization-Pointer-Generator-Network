A 12-year-old Texas boy has invented an app that transforms the power button of any Android phone into an alarm to call for help.

Middle school student Dylan Puccetti, 12, says his app comes to life when the phone is locked and the owner hits the power button six times â€” presumably while in need of a discreet panic button during a dangerous situation.

Dubbed 'SaveMePro,' the app sends a pre-written text message alerting of an imminent threat to one or several numbers programmed into it.

'If I was getting abducted and I have my 
phone in my pocket, all I have to do is reach down and press the power 
button,' Puccetti, of Gaveston, told KHOU.

With a 99-cent upgrade, the app will also send out a map with GPS coordinates to its location.

'I hope it will save somebody's life,' Puccetti told KHOU.

The station reported that Puccetti's inspiration comes from hearing about the story of Galveston County teenager Jessica Cain, who disappeared in 1997.

'She needed an emergency alert button,' Puccetti told KHOU.

The app has been downloaded some 200 times since its launch on Aug. 1.

'I'm going to make sure all my children and 
grandchildren have it on their phones,' wrote user Judi Christensen in a review of SaveMePro.

The boy's father says this is Dylan's second patent. He also designed a device to help improve pitching skills in young baseball players while he was in fifth grade, according to the station.

'His mind is always going,' gushed the dad, Michael. 'He's always thinking of great stuff.'

For now, the app is only available on Android.
