The Spielberg classic Jaws has heavily influenced Western Australia's strategy on how to deal with sharks, according to latest research.

It allowed politicians to promote the idea of killing sharks rather than developing strategies to make beaches safe for swimmers.

According to researchers, the 'Jaws effect' has propelled the idea that killing 'the shark' is the only solution.

Other factors influenced authorities, such as the intention of sharks and the perception that all human-shark interactions are fatal.  

In the 1975 classic a group of men set out to kill a great white after a young woman is killed by a shark. The men battle it out with the shark, in a of man vs nature scenario.

This October, the West Australian government withdrew an application to the federal government to extend its policy of using aquatic traps although it did get permission to kill sharks deemed by the government to pose an 'imminent threat' to people on the beach.

A number of shark 'bites' will cause dramatic escalations of policy response, for example, the kill order instituted in 2011 after the idea that one 'rogue' shark may have been responsible for a number of attacks.

November 29, 2014 - 13-year-old Cameron Pearman was bit in the leg at Pyramids Beach about 80 km south of Perth

October 2, 2014 - Bunbury man Sean Pollard, lost part of both of his arms after the attack at Wylie Bay.

March 29, 2014 - The body of Michael McGregor was found near Mandurah with shark bites on it.

November 23, 2013 - Surfer Chris Boyd was killed by a shark in the waters off Gracetown in WA's South West

July 14, 2012 - Ben Linden, 24, was killed while surfing near Wedge Island, Western Australia, 180km north of Perth.

October 22, 2011 - American tourist George Thomas Wainwright, 32, sustained horrific injuries and died while scuba diving off Rottnest Island. 

A Department of Fisheries boat was dispatched to try to kill the shark, but it was not successful.

Doctor Christopher Neff, of the University of Sydney, said: 'In particular, the Western Australian Government's current 'Imminent Threat' policy to catch and kill 'rogue' sharks is predicated on Hollywood fiction.

'This policy is using myths as the basis for killing sharks that are protected by law and which provides no real beach safety.

'This fiction serves an important political purpose because films allow politicians to rely on familiar narratives following shark bites to blame individual sharks in order to make the events governable and to trump evidence-based science.

'The message from this research is that politicians do not have a right to their own set of scientific facts about sharks, no matter how popular the movie.

'Unpacking the politics of shark bites, or any public policy issue, involves addressing the way words and images are used to paint a picture for the public and inform policy choices.

'This research therefore offers broader implications for policy analysis.

'It identifies a worrying style of policy making where widely known fiction can be used to navigate the attribution of blame and to prescribe policy responses.'
