Armed forces veterans are to receive extra help to get jobs and transition into civilian life under a set of special measures announced by the Government.

The Prime Minister will launch the biggest overhaul of services for troops leaving the Forces with more than 60 changes being made.

The recommendations span every aspect of daily life - from education and training, to employment, housing, health, welfare and financial support.

It is aimed to support wounded soldiers and those at risk of turning to crime or suffering mental illness.

Ministers are keen to cut the number of veterans who end up in jail after returning from the front line.

About one in 30 prisoners have been in the Armed Forces.

Lord Ashcroft was commissioned by David Cameron to draw up the recommendations

Lord Ashcroft was commissioned by David Cameron to draw up the recommendations.

The Tory peer said more should be done to emphasise that former service personnel have a ‘great deal to offer’.

He said: ‘I am pleased to see that the Government has accepted the great majority of the proposals, and that work is already underway on many of them.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said on Saturday: ‘Our brave servicemen and women make huge sacrifices to keep this country safe. Whatever the reasons behind their decision to leave our armed services, we must absolutely do all we can to smooth the move into civilian life.

‘That is why Lord Ashcroft’s review is so important, because it pinpoints the areas where we need to do more. 

'I’m pleased that much of that work is now under way and I am determined to ensure that we deliver on the rest to ensure that our Armed Forces have the support they need to build a secure and better future.’

Whitehall officials say work is already under way to establish a single 24-hour contact centre number for veterans in urgent need of advice, supported by Combat Stress and the Samaritans.

Other measures being rolled out also include resettlement advice for all those who leave the Services and education schemes to help Services personnel manage their finances better.

The Government is also looking to introduce a longterm development and career support system and provide online courses.
