Drivers on most Australian roads would be accustomed to seeing My Family stickers plastered on the back of car windscreens.

But the Gold Coast entrepreneurs behind the wildly popular trend have come under fire with claims the stickers could make those who choose to display them vulnerable to theft.

U.S. police have issued a warning that the stickers could reveal useful details to criminals and therefore be making drivers targets, reported The Gold Coast Bulletin.

Backlash: The creators of My Family stickers, Monica Liebenow and husband Phil Barham, pictured, have defended their product after U.S. police issued a safety warning about revealing private information

Creator Monica Liebenow of Gold Coast suburb of Burleigh, has rubbished the warnings.

'They are harmless stickers and they are put on cars with a great intention by people who want to express their family pride,' she said.

'I really don't think that is how any would-be robber is going to figure out their next victim,' she said. 'I’m sure they would have more sophisticated ways of doing that.'

Ms Liebenow and her husband Phil Barham started the company in 2009 and the mother-of-four said the ongoing success of the stickers proved they posed no dangers.

Urging critics to lighten up in their stance, Ms Liebenow said the stickers were a fun gesture that allowed people to express their family pride and some of their hobbies.

The range has been a huge success and Ms Ms Liebenow said the continued popularity was proof the stickers did not pose any danger

For those concerned about any possible threat the stickers may pose, the entrepreneur's advice is simple.

'If you're worried about it, don't put it on your car (and) if we're going to make assumptions about things, why can’t we just assume the best,' she said.

Ms Liebenow also added that the stickers were never intended to be taken seriously.

Bond University criminologist and former police officer Terry Goldsworthy said the stickers were similar to sharing information on social media and that there was some risk to sharing private information publicly.

Mr Golsworthy said there was always the possibility that someone could use the for ulterior motives.

He gave the example of a young attractive girl being seen getting into a car with a sticker of her and a dog. In the absence of a male sticker, it could be assumed there is no man in her life, making her a target for someone to follow.

'Then they know your family structure, your car and where you live so while by themselves the stickers may not be of importance, together it can all add up,' he said.
