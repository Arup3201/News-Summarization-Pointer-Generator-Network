With summer just around the corner, Essex's most famous fashionista has unveiled a flattering and colourful range of dresses she promises will brighten up everyone's holiday wardrobe.

Gemma Collins, 33, has added a capsule collection of maxi dresses to her summer range and shows us how to pull off the look in her latest campaign.

Speaking about her latest line of dresses, Gemma said: 'Surprisingly, a maxi dress can be very flattering as it disguises the legs and can lengthen them. Sneak a pair of high heels underneath to give yourself the extra height.'

Revealing her top tips for flattering your arms on holiday, Gemma said: 'Three-quarter length sleeves will flatter your figure more than long or short ones.

'They have the effect of making the body, as well as the arms, appear slimmer. Why? Because they stop at the slimmest part of the arm.

'As for dresses, wear wrap dresses or those with ruched detail. It will focus the attention to the centre of your body and create a more defined waist line,' she said.

Gemma's style CV is growing: she scooped best designer at 
the prestigious British plus-size fashion awards earlier this year.

Speaking
 about her contribution to the fashion industry as she launches her 
fifth collection, she said: 'I've changed fashion. Women can get beautiful plus-size clothes thanks to me and I've opened a
 lot of doors for the industry. That's why I'll be here for my 120th 
collection.'

'It's
 crazy to think I was once a car dealer from Romford and now I've got 
this fashion empire. I have proven there's a massive market for 
plus-size women and my new range sort of says "Come on, girls! You're 
going to look amazing this summer",' she said.

And
 it seems that it's already working wonders - Gemma has had countless 
people stopping her in the street to thank her for designing clothes for
 fuller-figured women - and says she always stops to have a photo with them.

Proud: Speaking to MailOnline at the launch of her SS14 range, Gemma, 33, describes the response to her collections as 'overwhelming'

Unlike many high-end designers she doesn't care for celebrities wearing her range and would rather see 'everyday women' rocking her styles.

'As long as everyday women on the school run feel confident in it, I am happy. My designs prove you can be bigger and still look glamorous.'

Gemma, whose friends say all she ever talks about is her range, believes that she has the skills and knowledge required to create a fashion empire.

'You have to be big to design for plus-size women, you have to know what it feels like.

'In the next few years, I see myself having a flagship store on Oxford Street next to Topshop and there will be a Gemma Collins store in every town.

Welcome to the good life: Aside from her successful design career, Gemma has been enjoying a break from TOWIE and says she is in a good place

'I get so many people emailing me requesting me to open up in their town.'

Aside from her successful design career, Gemma has been enjoying a break from TOWIE and says she is in a good place.

'I was deeply unhappy last year but I'm the happiest I've been in a long time. I'm back to my old self and having loads of fun.'

After a tumultuous engagement, Gemma is single and ready to mingle. 'I've been on some lovely dates,' she said. 'I'd love to use Tinder but I believe in fate and just want to have fun.

'We're heading to Marbella in seven weeks, it's going to be amazing, watch this space.'

So will Gemma be following the famed 'no carbs before Marbs' diet that the cast of TOWIE have popularised ahead of her summer jaunt?

'I'll never give up the old carbs but I've been healthier lately and lost a bit of weight. I have time when we aren't filming to make better food choices and prepare healthier meals.

'Let's just say, I'm going wild in Marbella!'
