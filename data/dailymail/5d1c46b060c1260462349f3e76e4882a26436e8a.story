Viewers of Channel 4's coverage of the Paralympic opening ceremony last night were furious after the broadcaster repeatedly cut from the live action to ad breaks.

Many took to social networking sites to complain, with several saying the broadcasting rights should have been given to the BBC instead.

TV presenter Phillip Schofield tweeted: 'loving the spectacle of the Paralympics but it sits a bit awkwardly with the ads or is that just me.'

Not impressed: Viewers complained about Channel 4's coverage that was broken up by adverts

When Channel 4 cut to a second ad break twenty minutes into the ceremony, viewers voiced their outrage.

Channel 4 showed five advert breaks in the first hour and a half of its coverage, featuring advertisements for brands like Toyota and Asda, Paralympic sponsors like Sainsbury's and even for its own Paralympic coverage.

Viewers missed an inspirational video montage and the entrance of athletes from several countries during the breaks.

A Channel 4 insider said they were showing fewer ads than they usually would.

The insider tweeted: 'If you're asking about ads, we're showing less than usual but as a commercially funded bcaster they allow us to show events like the Paras.'

Should the BBC have bought the rights to the Paralympics - and shown an ad-free Opening Ceremony?

A spokesman added: 'We took the decision to run less advertising during the opening ceremony than would usually be broadcast in our peak time programming but Channel 4 is a commercially funded public service broadcaster and advertising allows us to invest in original programming and events such as the Paralympics.'

Radio DJ Chris Evans said: 'Nice, 
sell cars off the back of the national anthem. How patriotic. We'll be 
right back to the opening ceremony after these messages.'

The
 reaction contrasted with that received by the BBC for its Olympics 
coverage. The broadcaster was highly praised around the world for its 
seamless coverage of all events and both the opening and closing 
ceremony, while stations like NBC in the U.S. was criticised for not 
showing key events live.

Several Twitter users said that the broadcasting rights should have been given to the BBC instead.

One user, 'Abby', wrote: 'however well Channel 4 do the Paralympic coverage the advertbreaks are going to let it down.'

While 'Emily' said: 'not impressed with the amount of ad breaks already in theparalympic coverage #shouldbethebbc.'

A peak audience of 11.2 million watched last night's Channel 4 coverage of the London 2012 Paralympic Games opening ceremony – the biggest Channel 4 audience in over 10 years.

The average audience across the four and a quarter hour show was 7.6 million, 40 percent share of the television audience.  

This compares to a peak audience of 2.8 million for the Paralympics opening ceremony in Beijing in 2008.

Channel 4’s Chief Creative Officer, Jay Hunt said: 'Last night's opening ceremony was a spectacular start to the London 2012 Paralympic Games and I'm delighted that so many viewers enjoyed it with us.  It kicks off eleven days of great sporting coverage on Channel 4.'

'Katz'
 tweeted: 'Wish the BBC had the #paralympic coverage as well. Their 
coverage of the games was superb. The ad breaks on ch4 are going to get 
on my wick!'

And Ruth Hecht wrote: 'Watching #Paralympic #OpeningCeremony with endless ad breaks is going to get very very tedious.'

Many
 complained that Channel 4 hosted a six-hour music event called C4 House 
Party last week with no advert breaks but did not stop the adverts 
during the ceremony.

Matt 
Martin said: 'So, C4 can broadcast 6 hours of music without an ad-break 
but NOT our own Paralympic Opening Ceremony? Morons.'

And Ross Taylor tweeted: 'Wow C4. Ad 
breaks in the paralympic opening ceremony when you didnt have any during
 the 6hr clubbing night. Classy.'

Olympic
 torch bearer and actor Jay Lusted wrote: '@C4Paralympics are you for 
real?!?!? Seriously?!?! An advertbreak in the middle of the Paralympic 
opening ceremony! How stupid!! #whatajoke.'

While viewer Richard Andrews said: 
'YOU ARE KIDDING! An ad break in the middle of the #ParalympicOpening 
Ceremony?! I know it's C4, but surely this is an exception?'

Dave Mager tweeted: 'An Ad Break in the middle of the #Paralympic Opening Ceremony? Disgusting.'

And Twitter user Oliver Primus said: 'Nothing says 'inspirational paralympic story' like ad breaks about cars and shit films.'

Dame Kelly Holmes wrote: 'What's with the Ad breaks, I want to see it.'

Viewers voiced their frustrations with the ad breaks during the Opening Ceremony coverage on Twitter

Many countries missed their nations arriving at the Olympic Stadium because of the breaks

They
 also cut away from the parade of paralympic athletes from different 
nations-meaning some nations were missed out completely.

Some 
appeared to defend Channel 4. Olympic gold medallist Matthew Pinsent 
wrote: 'If you don't like the ad breaks please complain to LOCOG. C4 won
 the right to host the coverage over the BBC.'

And
 PR manager Dave Allan wrote: 'if Channel4 were willing to outbid other 
channels for paralympic coverage then why shouldn't they have ads?'

Away
 from the advert controversy, Twitter was once again full of excitement 
for London 2012 as the Paralympics opening ceremony got under way.

After
 Professor Steven Hawking opened the ceremony with a monologue about 
humanity and science and dancers with umbrellas played out a short 
opening section before the athletes' parade, many took to the social 
networking site to express their approval.

Among the questions asked of the broadcaster was why they were able to run a six-hour advert-free music broadcast a week ago yet the Paralympics had regular intermissions

In the first hour of broadcasting there were five advert breaks for a variety of well-known brands

Some people defended the coverage, however, saying people should complain to Locog which issued the rights to broadcast and not Channel 4

Writer Claire Fox quoted the eminent 
physicist's speech, tweeting: '£Paralympics opening ceremony quite 
highbrow and operatic so far. Like that and 'be curious/look to stars' 
theme.'

Olympic gold 
medallist Dame Kelly Holmes admitted she would find it hard to keep her 
emotions in check during the world's second-biggest sporting event.

She said: 'Here we go @C4Paralympics Good Luck for a fab show tonight with the Opening Ceremony. Tissues at the ready.'

Presenter
 Claire Balding, now with Channel 4 after covering the Olympics for the 
BBC, spoke of the 'magical' atmosphere in the Olympic Park.

She said: 'It's not raining. There's a full moon. The stadium and the Orbit are lit up. This is quite magical'.

Others
 were less descriptive but still full of praise. Illustrator and author 
Judy Astley said: 'So glad I'm watching this. It's completely brilliant.
 £Paralympics'.

Reality TV personality Imogen Thomas said simply: 'Amazing £paralympics'.
