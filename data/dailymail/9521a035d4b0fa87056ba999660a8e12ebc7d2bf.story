Generous strangers struck by her bravery have raised more than $295,000 for the heroic Texas teen who watched in horror as her ex-uncle allegedly executed her parents and four siblings at her family home last week.

Cassidy Stay, 15, survived the July 9 massacre by playing 
dead when a bullet grazed her head, before calling police - an action which saved the lives of her grandparents, who Ron Haskell was intent on killing next.

Inspired by the teenager's smiling stoicism, despite losing her entire family, thousands of supporters around the world have donated nearly $300,000 to an online GoFundMe campaign called 'Stay Strong' to assist her.

Silver lining: Cassidy, pictured far left with her entire family, said that one day she will get to see her mother, Katie, father, Stephen, and siblings Bryan, 14, Emily, 9, Rebecca, 7, and Zach, age 4

The 'Stay Family Tragedy - Cassidy Stay Fund' went live on Thursday, the day after the massacre, and within 24 hours approached $150,000.

'We had no idea that it would be the official site for that the family,' Jody Dellinger, one of the founders of the site, told Community Impact News. 'The outpouring just dumbfounds me when you have a tragedy like this.'

On
 Saturday, Cassidy and her grandfather Robert Lyon attended a 
celebration of life organized in Spring to remember their slain loved 
ones.

After
 taking a deep breath, a smiling Cassidy mounted the stage to address 
more than 400 people who came out to pay tribute to her parents and 
siblings, as seen in a video of the event recorded by Click2Houston.

She began by thanking those people who have been praying for 
her and the entire Stay family, and the first responders and medical 
personnel who took care of her.

With
 her voice slightly cracking, Cassidy said: 'I'm feeling a lot better 
and I'm on a very straightforward path to a full recovery.' 

Before 
continuing her prepared remarks, the brave young woman drew another deep
 breath and then proceeded to quote from one of her favorite books in 
the Harry Potter series.

'In
 the Prisoner of Azkaban, Dumbledore says, “Happiness can be found even 
in the darkest times if one only remembers to turn on the light,”’ she 
told the audience, wiping away tears.

In a voice filled with emotion, Cassidy Stay then told those in attendance she is certain that she and her family will be reunited someday.

'I know that my mom, dad, Bryan, Emily, Becca, and Zach are in a much better place, and that I'll be able to see them again one day,' she said.

Cassidy then flashed a smile and exclaimed, 'Stay Strong,' which has become a rallying cry for the girl's family and the Spring community.

Before the event at Lemm Elementary School, Cassidy helped release 600 colorful balloons into the air - 100 for each slain member of her family.

Katie 
Stay, 34, her husband, Stephen, 39, and four of their five children 
between the ages of 4 and 14 were shot dead in their suburban Houston 
home last Wednesday.

Ronald Haskell, 33, has been charged with capital murder in connection to the massacre.

During
 his first court appearance Friday, a disheveled-looking Haskell with 
handcuffs on his wrists collapsed in twice as a prosecutor read out 
details of the crime.

The heavyset man had to be lifted into a wheelchair and removed from the courtroom.

Authorities
 have said Haskell was searching for his ex-wife, Katie Stay's sister, 
Melanie, when he came to the Stays' home in Spring.

He tied up
 the family and put them face-down on the floor before shooting each in 
the back of the head, according to investigators. The family had refused
 to say where Haskell could find his ex-wife.

Investigators
said that Cassidy suffered a skull fracture from a bullet 
graze but survived by playing dead to call 911 and warn police that 
Haskell planned to shoot other relatives.

Haskell was eventually cornered in front of the home of Cassidy's grandparents and taken into custody.

Al
 Barker, the lawyer who represented Melanie Lyon in her divorce from 
Haskell, has revealed to MailOnline that Haskell's ex-wife believes 
their split after 11 torturous years of marriage was to blame for the tragedy.

The attorney relayed a conversation he had this week with Melanie's mother, who told him that after learning the news of her sister and nephews' deaths her daughter said: 'She had to pay the ultimate price for freedom.'

Those who knew the Haskells have said that the couple had a rocky marriage, and that Melanie was desperate to get away from her husband who allegedly beat her in front of their children. 

Haskell pleaded guilty to simple assault in a domestic violence-related incident in 2008, according to Utah state court records.

Court documents show that both Hasekll's mother and sister had requested restraining orders against him following domestic violence incidents that took place in November 2013 and as recently as last week.
