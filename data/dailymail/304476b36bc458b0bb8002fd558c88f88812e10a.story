An SUV slammed into a horse-drawn buggy with such force that it ejected four people, including a three-month-old baby onto the street, in Pennsylvania Dutch country.

Authorities said the crash occurred at 7 p.m. on Thursday on Kirkwood Pike at the intersection with Maple Shade Road in Colerain Township.

The buggy drove past a stop sign and was hit by the Subaru Outback injuring all seven people inside the buggy.

All of the injured were taken to Lancaster General Hospital by ambulance - apart from the infant. 

The impact of the crash shattered the wood and fiberglass carriage into pieces, scattering debris more than 50-yards away.

Witnesses said they found parts of the buggy yards from the intersection where the collision occurred.

Becky Hemric, who lives nearby told Lancaster Online: 'I saw people laying everywhere and the buggy all smashed up.'

‘There was a baby who was thrown from the buggy. We just did what we could until help arrived.’ 

Another local resident, Mark Harmon was inside his home, when he heard the crash.

‘I knew it wasn't metal on metal,’ he said.

‘I saw the SUV rolling back down the hill after the accident. I ran up to help, and there were bodies everywhere.

‘People in the street, people attending to the baby. I just got them some blankets, and tried to keep them from getting hit by other cars.

‘I've never seen anything like it.’

Lancaster County-Wide Communications declared the crash a ‘mass casualty’ incident, calling multiple ambulance and medic units to the scene. 

The horse reportedly survived the crash.

Colerain Township is about 20 miles southeast of Lancaster.
