The parents of six-year-old Brynn Williams allege her teacher interrupted the child's speech and told her to sit down because she's 'not allowed to talk about the Bible in school'

A six-year-old girl's parents are taking her school to court over claims she was 'humiliated' by a teacher for talking about the Bible in a Christmas show and tell.

Attorneys for the family of pupil Brynn Williams allege the teacher interrupted her speech 
and told her to sit down because she's 'not allowed to talk
 about the Bible in school'.

The incident occurred on December 19 inside a first grade classroom at Helen Hunt-Jackson Elementary School in Temecula, in southern California.

The previous day the teacher had told her class to find something at home that represented a family Christmas tradition so they could share it in a classroom presentation.

Brynn Williams decided to bring in the Star of Bethlehem on top of her family's Christmas tree, FoxNews.com reported, and worked on a 60-second presentation to explain that her family's tradition.

'Our
 Christmas tradition is to put a star on top of our tree,' the little 
girl said. 'The star is named the Star of Bethlehem. The three kings 
followed the star to find baby Jesus, the Saviour of the world.'

According
 to Robert Tyler, the general counsel for the family's law firm, 
Advocates for Faith & Freedom, the teacher intervened before the 
child could utter another word.

'Brynn's
 teacher said, "Stop right there! Go take your seat," Mr Tyler claimed. 
'Brynn was not allowed to finish her presentation by reciting the Bible 
verse, John 3:16.'

Tyler said the little girl was the only student in the class not allowed to finish her presentation.

'After
 Brynn took her seat, the teacher explained to Brynn in front of all the
 other students that she was not allowed to talk about the Bible or 
share its verses,' Tyler said.

Her mother Gina Williams learned about the incident after she picked her daughter up from school.'She thought she had done something wrong. She thought she was in trouble,' Mrs Williams said. 'I told her she was not in trouble and I was proud of her. I tried to comfort her on the way home.'

The following day Mrs Williams met with the principal.

'The principal confirmed that Brynn's teacher did the appropriate thing by stopping her mid-presentation and there are specific education codes that protect the school,' she said.

The principal then asked Brynn, who had tears in her eyes, to come into her office and deliver the same presentation that was censored in the classroom.

Afterwards, the principal stood by her decision.

The principal reportedly told her that Brynn could write about her beliefs in a journal but she was not allowed to share her beliefs aloud to any other student.

Mr Tyler sent a letter to the school district demanding they apologise to Brynn and change their policies limiting religious liberty.

'The disapproval and hostility that Christian students have come to experience in our nation's public schools has become epidemic,' he said, warning that should the school district ignore their concerns, they will file a lawsuit.

In a statement issued to FoxNews.com, the school district said: 'The Temecula Valley Unified School District respects all students' rights under the Constitution and takes very seriously any allegation of discrimination.

â€˜Due to the fact that District officials are currently investigating the allegations, it would be inappropriate to provide further comment at this time.'
