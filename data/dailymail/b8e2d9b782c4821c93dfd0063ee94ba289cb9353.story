A politician was invited and uninvited twice from a Tea Party rally after pressure from Sarah Palin's unhappy aides who did not want her there.

Organisers of the Tea Party for America event in Indianola, Iowa, decided to cancel former U.S. Senate candidate Christine O’Donnell's appearance.

Now former Alaska governor Mrs Palin’s appearance at the event - costing $100,000 to put on - has finally been confirmed, after it was also in doubt.

Ms O’Donnell received backing from Mrs Palin that helped her win the 2010 Delaware Senate primary and was first invited to the Iowa event.

But then flip-flopping organisers decided to withdraw the invite before she was invited again and then uninvited again, reported Gawker.

Ms O’Donnell is an outcast among many Tea Party
supporters, who have claimed she is erratic and unfit for political office, reported The
Atlantic.

Mrs Palin’s aides told the event organisers that the Alaska politician would not attend if Ms O’Donnell was allowed to speak there, reported Politico.

A source close to Mrs Palin said her team was also worried about fundraising and logistical changes that they had not approved.

Mrs Palin is known for making late changes to her schedule, although this was seen as an important appearance, reported the Wall Street Journal.

Many commentators think she could launch a Republican presidential campaign and 10,000 people are travelling from across the U.S. to attend.

She will be in Des Moines on Friday, and then at a Tea Party Express tour stop on Monday in New Hampshire, reported the Wall Street Journal.

It is even possible that Mrs Palin could hold an event on Saturday if she eventually decides not to attend the rally in Indianola on the same day.

Mrs Palin has previously snubbed Ms O’Donnell, who beat Representative Mike Castle in a GOP primary before losing to Democrat Chris Coons.

She chose to attend a New York Jets game instead of campaigning with Ms O’Donnell last year, reported the New York Times Magazine.
