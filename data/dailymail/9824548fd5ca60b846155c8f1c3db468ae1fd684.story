Health officials say people should eat less sugar. But that's easier said than done.

Anyone who has tried cutting down on sugar knows to avoid cookies, sodas and candy. But sugar can be hidden in lots of other common packaged foods.

The World Health Organization finalized guidelines Wednesday saying people should keep intake of added sugars to just five to ten per cent of overall calories, which translates to about 25 to 50 grams of sugar a day for most people.

Be warned: According to experts, many supermarket soup varieties can contain up to two teaspoons of sugar in just one can

The guidelines don't apply to naturally occurring sugars in fruits, vegetables and milk, since they come with essential nutrients.

In the U.S., adults get about 11 to 15 per cent of their calories from sugar; the figure for children tops that at about 16 per cent. 

By comparison, sugar intakes ranges in Europe from about seven per cent in Hungary to nearly 25 percent in Portugal. But research indicates that many people aren't aware of how much sugar they're eating every day. 

In fact, that's one reason the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is proposing the first overhaul of nutrition labels in two decades. 

In addition to highlighting the number of calories per serving in a bigger, bolder font, the new proposed labels would also for the first time list sugars that are added by manufacturers.

Healthy? While salad might seem like the healthy option, the dressings used to add flavor to them are often loaded with sugars

In the meantime, though, companies don't currently disclose how much of the sugar listed in the nutrition panels of their products are from added sugars rather than naturally occurring ones.

According to health experts, many everyday food products, which some might perceive to be completely healthy, are actually loaded with hidden sugars. 

Salad dressings, soups, yogurts and cereals have all been named as some of the worst offenders when it comes to sugar content; the popular Deluxe French salad dressing from Wish-Bone, for example, has four grams of sugar per serving - meaning it has around one teaspoon of sugar for every two tablespoons of dressing. 

Similarly, Progresso's Rich and Hearty Beef Pot Roast contains four grams of sugar per serving which means there are approximately two teaspoons of sugar in every can.

'In reality, we find (these sugars) in the majority of products,' Francesco Branca, who heads the World Health Oganization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, said. 

SALAD DRESSING: Picking a salad over a ham sandwich seems like a virtuous choice. But the amount of sugar it comes with can vary depending on the dressing you put on top of it. 

Wish-Bone's Deluxe French salad dressing, for instance, lists four grams (about one teaspoon) of sugar per serving (two tablespoons).

SOUP: A cup of soup of soup is comforting thought, but even savory varieties can have sugar. A can of Progresso's Rich and Hearty Beef Pot Roast has four grams (about one teaspoon) of sugar per serving, with a can containing two servings.

YOGURT: Another seemingly healthful choice that can come with lots of sugar. Some of the sugar is naturally occurring from the dairy, but companies add sweeteners too. A container of Chobani's 0% Fat Greek yogurt in black cherry flavor lists 17 grams (about four teaspoons) of sugar.

BREAD: That toast you're about to smother with jam might've already been a little sweetened. A store brand of enriched white bread at the convenience store chain Duane Reade listed two grams (about half a teaspoon) of sugar for per serving (two slices).

PEANUT BUTTER: It depends on the variety you pick, but peanut butter can come with added sugar too. Skippy's Super Chunk variety lists seven grams (almost two teaspoons) of sugar per serving (two tablespoons).

CEREAL: Most people know that cereal has sugar, especially the varieties for kids. In some cases, you might be surprised that there isn't much difference between options. 

Special K with Red Berries, for instance, has nine grams (more than two teaspoons) per serving (one cup), while Frosted Flakes has ten grams (more than two teaspoons) of sugar per serving (3/4 cup).

FROZEN MEALS: In case it wasn't clear by now, just because it's not dessert doesn't mean it doesn't have added sugar. California Kitchen's BBQ Chicken microwavable pizza has seven grams (almost two teaspoons) of sugar in a single-serving pie.
