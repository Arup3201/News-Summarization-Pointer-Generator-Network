The last sighting of State Department diplomat William Bradford Bishop was on March 2, 1976 - one day after police say he brutally bludgeoned his wife, three sons and his mother to death in their Potomac, Maryland home.

The bodies of wife, Annette, his mother Lobelia and his three boys, 4-year-old Brad, 10-year-old Brenton and 5-year-old Geoffrey were discovered burning in a shallow grave the same day in South Carolina.

Despite pictures of the multi-lingual Yale graduate being plastered across the nations television screens and newspapers the fugitive seemingly vanished into thin air.

Today the FBI added Bishop, who was dubbed the 'Family Annihilator', to its top 10 most wanted list - in the hope that nearly four decades later the extra publicity will finally bring about his capture.

Then and now: The FBI has released this model of what they believe William Bradford Bishop (left) in the 1970s would look like now as they added him to their Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on Thursday

Family Annihilator: Police believe Bishop used a sledgehammer to murder his wife, Annette, his mother and his three boys, 14-year-old Brad, 10-year-old Brenton and 5-year-old Geoffrey, back in 1976

'It's getting late in the day for him,' FBI Special Agent in Charge Steve Vogt told NBC Washington. 'He's 77, but we're going to put it out there and give it our best shot.'

Investigators believe that the well educated State Department officer who is fluent in five languages could have forged his own passport and over the years there have been a number of unconfirmed sightings in Europe.

Indeed, they believe that Bishop is still alive and could be living in plain sight, having altered his appearance since the death of his entire family.

'His wallet has never been found. His passport has never been found,' Vogt said. 'There's no indication that he's dead.'

Police strongly suspect that on March 1, Bishop used a hammer to beat his mother and wife to death inside their home and then battered his three sons while they were sleeping.

Montgomery County Sheriff Darren Popkin, who has been working the case for twenty years believes that Bishop killed his wife first as she was reading.

Then he callously killed his three young sons in their bedrooms before murdering his own mother as she returned home after walking the family dog, Leo.

Authorities say Bishop, a former Foreign Service officer, wrote of wanting a 'freer life' before the killings.

'He went from room to room,' said Popkin. 'And one at a time hit them around the head and killed each one of them.'

Scene: William Bradford "Brad" Bishop Jr., a State Department employee at the time, allegedly bludgeoned his family to death in their home in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and then drove to a wooded area in North Carolina, where authorities say he dumped their bodies in a shallow grave and burned them

'There was an awful lot of rage,' Popkin said. Bishop 'went from room to room with such anger and rage, it was just a terrible crime scene.'

Bishop then allegedly put the bodies inside the back of his maroon 1974 Chevrolet station wagon and drove six hours to North Carolina.

'A park ranger saw fire burning and immediately went to see what was going on. What he found was just absolutely grizzly. The discovery of five bodies in a shallow grave that was burning,' said Popkin to NBC Washington.

A grand jury indicted him on five counts of murder, but in the 38-years since, Bishop has not been apprehended - disappearing along with his dog.

'When Bishop took off in 1976, there was no social media, no 24-hour news cycle,' said Steve

'The only way to catch this guy is through the public.'

Brutal: In March 1976, Bishop allegedly used a hammer to bludgeon his family, including his three boys ages 5, 10 and 14

Horrific: Investigators believe he then set fire to the bodies in a shallow grave in North Carolina using the gas he bought (pictured)

Evidence: This is the shovel that Bishop allegedly used in 1976 to bury his family in a shallow grave

The FBI, along with the police and sheriff's departments of Montgomery County, Maryland, and the U.S. Department of State formed a task force last year to reinvestigate the Bishop case.

As part of that effort, a forensic artist created a three-dimensional, age-enhanced bust of what Bishop may look like now, at 77 years old.

'If Bishop is living with a new identity, he's got to be somebody's next-door neighbor,' Vogt said. 'Don't forget that five people were murdered. Bishop needs to be held accountable for that.'

A reward of up to $100,000 is being offered for information leading directly to Bishop's arrest, the FBI said.

Bishop's final few hours that authorities can account for began in the afternoon of March 1, 1976, when he left work early, telling his boss he was coming down with the flu.

He withdrew $400 from his bank and instead of driving home went to Sears at Montgomery Mall and bought a gas can and a hammer.

From there he went to Potomac Village to purchase a shovel and a pitchfork.

He was last seen at a Jacksonville, North Carolina, sporting goods store, where he bought a pair of sneakers, the FBI said.

He then allegedly killed his entire family before wrapping their bodies in sheets and driving them to Columbia, North Carolina.

It took authorities in North Carolina a seven days to identify the bodies after using dental records and clothing descriptions.

In discussing what Bishop would look like now, NBC Washington spoke to the FBI, who said that his most distinguising feature is his pointed chin.

Do you recognize this man?: The former U.S. Department of State employee, William Bradford Bishop Jr., has been on the run since 1976 and could be hiding in plain sight, the FBI said

The FBI also revealed that hs has a curl to his upper right lip and a scar on his back from surgery.

Vogt said, 'I would expect him to still be in fairly good shape, based on his activities and what he enjoyed doing.'

Investigators describe him as being adventurous and a lover of outdoor sports such as skiing and hiking.

He has a military background - which could enable him to live off the land as self-sufficient.

The FBI also pointed out that they have never found the body of Bishop's dog, Leo.

'People brought it up over and over that he loved his dog,' Vogt said. 'He took his dog with him. That's the only creature that survived in that house.'

Bishop also had a pilots license and was able to speak, Italian, French, German and Croatian.

Other skills he possessed, which adds fuel to theory he may have left the United States, were that of making passports.

'There's a certain potential that he could be overseas,' Matus said. 'He was certainly trained for that. He was certainly educated enough to pass off as a diplomat.'

There hasn't been a confirmed sighting of Bishop since 1976, in Jacksonville, N.C., although three people who knew him have reported spotting him in Europe over the years, most recently in 1994.

Horror: 'There was an awful lot of rage,Â¿ police said of the scene inside the house. Bishop 'went from room to room with such anger and rage, it was just a terrible crime scene'

'Brad, you've been living with this on your conscience now for 38 years,' Montgomery County, Maryland, Sheriff Darren Popkin said.

'I am the voice of your family who can no longer speak. The time is now to contact law enforcement.'

People on the FBI's most wanted list have included Osama Bin Laden, Boston organized crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger and James Earl Ray, who assassinated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

The list was founded in 1950, and more than 90 percent of the 501 people placed on the list have been found.

The FBI, the State Department and local police established a task force last year to review the Bishop case, and authorities hope that by placing him on the list, the public might be able to help find him.

'Bishop broke with his life and assumed a new identity. Because of that fact, most traditional fugitive investigative techniques are worthless,' said Steve Vogt, special agent in charge of the FBI Baltimore Division.

'We're hoping media and people who are active on social media pay attention to this; they'll be the ones to solve this case.'

Bishop replaces alleged MS-13 gang member Juan Elias Garcia on the most-wanted list. Garcia, who's charged in the execution-style murders of a 19-year-old woman and her 2-year-old son, surrendered in late March, just two days after he was placed on the list.
