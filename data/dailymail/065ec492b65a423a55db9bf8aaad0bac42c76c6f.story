An Ohio police dog that went missing two months ago and gained 24,000 Facebook followers on a page created by his owner has finally been found safe and sound.

K-9 Karson and his handler, officer Jerry Popp, shared an emotional reunion on Sunday after the dog saw Popp and immediately jumped into the front seat of his police truck. 

Popp said he fell to the snow and cried after they found his furry friend. 

He ran away on December 20. 

Officer Jerry Popp has been reunited with his K9 Karson, who gained nearly 24,000 followers on Facebook while he was missing 

After Karson saw his owner he immediately jumped into Popp's truck, where they shared an emotional hug

But the reunion wasn't quick, according to a post Popp wrote on Karson's Facebook page. 

Although Popp called commands to Karson he was not close enough to be seen, and the scared dog began to run from the truck. 

Popp ran for the Belgian Malinois on foot, while Sergeant Ron Fithen pursued him in their truck. 

After the dog finally gave up and stopped running, Fithen got out of the truck and laid down in the snow. 

Popp wrote that Fithen wanted to appear 'small and nonthreatening' as he began to talk to the K9. Popp then walked behind Karson, who immediately jumped into the truck when he saw him. 

As Popp fell the ground and cried, Fithen and a lost dog specialist consoled him and then enveloped him in a group hug.

'Getting the furry boy home is just a loss of words,'  Fithen told WLWT 5. 

'Just being there at the moment when I met eyes with Karson knowing he was coming home today that - that has made my year.'

Karson at first ran from Popp and his fellow officer because he didn't recognize them and was scared 

Popp fell to the ground and cried after Karson was finally safe and found in the truck. An officer and lost dog specialist comforted the handler before enveloping him in a group hug 

Popp immediately updated Karson's Facebook fans after the rescue.

'Karson has been found. I have him in the truck next to me,' he wrote. #

'He's alive and healthy. It's all over finally.'

The K9 went missing two days before Christmas after escaping from a boarding kennel where he was staying while Popp was on vacation. 

Karson lost 14 pounds while he was away, surviving record-breaking low temperatures. 

Popp said he was getting plenty of sleep and being very quiet as he recovered at home. 

The devoted handler posted frequent updates about Karson after he went missing, keeping the dog's followers informed as the police received numerous sightings and tips.

Karson's Facebook page had a devoted following and users were overjoyed to hear of the dog's safe return

Facebook users shared their joy with news of the dog's return. 

'I can't say how relieved I am for you and your family and the department,' one user wrote. 

'I along with my 9 year old daughter have been following you and K9 Karson since day one. We have checked this site everyday over a hundred times a day reading every post and hoping Karson would be found.' 

Another user advised Popp to get some much needed sleep. 

'Rest well with your boy... cause he has thousands of tennis balls to play with you,' they wrote. 

Police Chief Duane Weyand said Karson wasn't 'just a dog' but a member of the department and the community. 

'That's been our driving force that he belongs here. He's one of us.'
