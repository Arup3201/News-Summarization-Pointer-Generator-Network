Outspoken: Boris Johnson urged all editors to follow the example of The Spectator magazine, which has said it has no intention of abiding by the new system, which gives a statutory basis to a new media regulator

Publishers should stick the Government’s plans for a Royal Charter on Press regulation ‘in the privy’, Boris Johnson said yesterday.

The London Mayor urged all editors to follow the example of The Spectator magazine, which has said it has no intention of abiding by the new system, which gives a statutory basis to a new media regulator.

Mr Johnson said he was pleased the magazine ‘has told the Privy Council to stick its charter in the privy’, and he urged ‘all other editors to follow suit’.

Last month, politicians agreed the detail of a charter enshrining a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into media standards.

An alternative proposal put forward by the Press, which would have meant a new independent regulator having strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £1million for wrongdoing, up-front corrections, with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently, and independence from the industry and politicians, was rejected.

The Spectator has already announced that it will refuse to take part in the Government’s new system of regulation.

The Government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse to join a regulator approved under its charter will be hit with ‘exemplary’ damages in libel cases.

However, senior figures including Lord Lester, an eminent QC who is the architect of reforms to Britain’s notorious libel laws, have suggested that will violate Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of expression.

Winner: Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured with Mr Johnson, was named Politician of the Year

Critics warn the new regime means an end to 300 years of Press freedom.

Mr Johnson was presenting awards at The Spectator’s annual Parliamentarian of the Year ceremony in London.

The Parliamentarian of the Year award, normally given to a single MP, was given to the 15 MPs who voted against Government plans for exemplary damages.

Home Secretary Theresa May was named Politician of the Year.
