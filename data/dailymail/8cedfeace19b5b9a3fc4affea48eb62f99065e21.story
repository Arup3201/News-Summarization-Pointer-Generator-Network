Arsenal have been offered the chance to bring Mario Balotelli back to England.

AC Milan are prepared to sell the 23-year-old to fund an overhaul of their squad and want around £30million.

Balotelli has scored 30 goals in 54 games for Milan but the fallen Italian giants are strapped for cash and are struggling to finance even smaller deals such as Adel Taarabt’s £5m move from QPR.

Offer: Arsenal have been offered the chance to bring Mario Balotelli back to England for £30m

Consideration: Arsene Wenger is looking to bolster his strikeforce for next season

Milan have grown increasingly frustrated at Balotelli’s erratic behaviour, the kind that infuriated players and staff alike at Manchester City, with his mood swings evident during TV interviews and touchline strops.

They are keen to offer him to clubs around Europe with Monaco the favourites.

Manchester City have a buy-back option but are unlikely to take that up, yet other English clubs have been asked to consider bidding and Arsenal are among them.

Arsene Wenger seems likely to pursue interest in QPR striker Loic Remy and head off interest from Tottenham, but is looking at other options too and has considered Bayern Munich’s Mario Mandzukic, Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema and Alvaro Morata, plus Rodrigo of Benfica.
