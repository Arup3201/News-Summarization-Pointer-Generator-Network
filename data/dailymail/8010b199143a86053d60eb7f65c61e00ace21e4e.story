It hasn't been a bad week for Tottenham midfielder Erik Lamela. 

After scoring against world champions Germany and helping his Argentinian team to a 4-2 win in Dusseldorf, Lamela posted a picture on his Instagram account lounging on a speedboat near the Spanish party isle of Ibiza.

In the picture, shown below, Lamela is stretched out on the front of the boat, with his girlfriend Sofia Herrero alongside him.

The 22-year-old was en route from the Spanish island of Ibiza to the smaller, more picturesque isle of Formentera to the south when he took to Instagram to pose for his 61,000 followers.

Lamela scored the second of Argentina's four goals on Wednesday night, when the World Cup runners up faced winners Germany in a re-run of July's final in Rio de Janeiro. 

Argentina do not play again until they meet rivals Brazil in an international friendly on 11 October, so Lamela has some down-time before he returns to Tottenham for their trip to Sunderland on the 13 September.
