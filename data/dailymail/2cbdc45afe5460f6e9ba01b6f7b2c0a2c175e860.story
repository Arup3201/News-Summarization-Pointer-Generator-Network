Egypt's disgraced ex-president Hosni Mubarak could be freed as early as today following a court ruling that jolted a nation already in turmoil today.

Convening yesterday at the Cairo jail where Mubarak is held, the court ordered the release of the military man who ruled Egypt for 30 years until he was overthrown during the uprisings that swept the Arab world in early 2011.

News of the ruling came as the EU decided to suspend exports of weapons and goods to Egypt, but stopped short of halting aid programmes for fear of hurting ordinary Egyptians already suffering.

Decision time: A closed hearing to decide whether Egypt's jailed former president Hosni Mubarak (seen at a court appearance earlier this month) should be freed has begun outside Cairo

Turmoil: A curfew imposed by the military-backed authorities remained in force in Cairo yesterday as they continued their arrest campaign against middle and lower-ranking members of the Muslim Brotherhood

Asked when his client would go free, Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed al-Deeb, replied: 'Maybe tomorrow'.

Mubarak, 85, was sentenced to life in 
prison last year for failing to prevent the killing of demonstrators. 
But a court accepted his appeal earlier this year and ordered a retrial.

The ailing ex-president probably has 
no political future, but some predicted 'public outrage' in the wake of the court ruling, which state prosecutor Ahmed 
el-Bahrawi said cannot be appealed.

'The army has brought back Mubarak's 
regime, the same regime,' said Guma Abdel Alim, outside a bicycle shop 
in central Cairo. 'Those who were elected by the people are now in 
prison.'

He was referring to a widescale security sweep on Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood that has netted many of its leaders.

The 28 EU foreign ministers have called on the military authorities 
and the supporters of deposed President Mohammed Morsi's Muslim 
Brotherhood movement to resume negotiations to avoid further bloodshed.

Unrest: Sit-ins staged in support of the ousted Muslim Brotherhood are being forcibly dispersed by military-backed authorities in Egypt

Anger: Supporters of Egypt's ousted President Mohammed Morsi, seen with posters that read 'yes to legitimacy, no to the coup' in Arabic, are seen marching in Cairo on Monday

'It was decided ... to suspend all arms deliveries that can be used 
internally,' said French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius following the 
emergency meeting in Brussels. 'We have decided to maintain our aid for 
the Egyptian population because it already suffers enormously,' he 
added.

Clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsi's supporters have killed hundreds of people since last week.

'We do believe that the recent operations of the security forces have 
been disproportionate and we're worried about the resulting alarming 
number of people that have been killed,' said the EU's foreign policy 
chief Catherine Ashton.

Political turbulence has kept Egypt on
 edge for months. At least 900 people, including 100 soldiers and 
police, have been killed in a crackdown on Morsi supporters in the past 
week, making it the country's bloodiest internal episode in decades.

The United States and the European 
Union have both been reviewing aid to Cairo in light of the bloodshed, but 
Saudi Arabia, a foe of the Brotherhood, has promised to make up any 
shortfall.

There was no immediate reaction to the ruling on Mubarak from the Brotherhood, whose leaders are mostly behind bars.

Mubarak is still being retried on 
charges of complicity in the killing of protesters during the revolt 
against him, but he has already served the maximum pre-trial detention 
in that case.

The court ruling removed the last 
legal ground for his imprisonment in connection with a corruption case, 
following a similar decision in another corruption case on Monday. 
Mubarak will not be allowed to leave Egypt and his assets remain frozen.

Mubarak's two sons, Gamal and Alaa, 
along with former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly, are still in prison, 
and Adly's lawyer said the ruling on Mubarak had no bearing on their 
cases.

Some of the liberal and secular 
politicians who backed the army's ousting of Morsi, Egypt's first freely
 elected president, on July 3, said they regretted the hated Mubarak's 
release, but argued that the judiciary's decision should be respected.

Response: Obama interrupted his vacation to announce that a planned joint military exercise with Egypt would not go ahead in light of the escalating crisis

'His regime was lousy and he destroyed
 the country,' said Mohamed Abolghar, head of the Egyptian Social 
Democratic Party, to which the army-appointed interim prime minister 
belongs.

Noting Mubarak's age and the jail time
 he has served, he said: 'We should focus on building the country, 
establishing democracy and finishing the problem of the Muslim 
Brotherhood.

'The government knows that if Mubarak is freed there will be public outrage, but a court decision is a court decision.'

Khaled Dawoud, spokesman of the 
liberal Dostour Party, said the trials of the ex-president and his 
associates had all been flawed because the judiciary was ill-equipped to
 deal with cases related to Mubarak's rule, resulting in a series of 
acquittals. 'It was a faulty process from the beginning,' he said.

The relatively muted response from 
Mubarak's non-Islamist opponents may reflect a reluctance to rock the 
boat following the army's removal of Morsi, which they had endorsed.

The generals say they were responding 
to the will of the people after vast demonstrations organised by 
liberals and leftists demanding Morsi's ousting. They have installed an 
interim administration to oversee a roadmap back to democracy.

Hundreds of people - including 70 
policemen and soldiers - have been killed in Egypt since the 
military-backed government forcibly dispersed sit-ins supporting the 
ousted Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo a week ago.

The
 resulting massacre saw President Barack Obama interrupt his holiday in 
Martha's Vineyard to declare that his government would not hold a 
planned joint military exercise with Egyptian forces next month.

But
 Obama remained silent on the question of whether the billions of 
dollars in foreign aid sent to Egypt from the U.S. each year will 
continue in spite of the ongoing bloodshed.

The EU and its member states last year pledged a combined 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) in loans and aid for Egypt. Diplomats from several EU countries cautioned that a decision to halt all aid programs was unlikely since many are directed at helping the poor or propping up civil society groups - not directly supporting the government.

Moreover, EU threats to cut some aid may not frighten Egypt's leadership since Saudi Arabia - a long-time critic of the Muslim Brotherhood - has pledged to plug any shortfall. Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf nations, including Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have so far promised $12 billion in new aid.

A suspension of EU arms shipments seemed more likely. 'I would assume that no one would export arms in this situation,' Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said on his way into the meeting.

The Islamists arrested in Egypt yesterday include a preacher known for his fiery sermons at Muslim Brotherhood gatherings, who was reportedly caught as he tried to flee to neighbouring Libya in disguise, and a spokesman for the movement said to have been en route to catch a flight out of the country.

They are the latest allies of President Mohammed Morsi, who hails from the Brotherhood, to be arrested.

This week, authorities detained the Brotherhood's supreme leader and spiritual 
guide, Mohammed Badie, dealing a serious blow to an embattled movement 
now struggling to keep up its protest campaign against the military's 
overthrow of Morsi and subsequent deadly assaults on pro-Morsi sit-ins.

A
 court ruling earlier in the week raised the possibility that Mubarak 
could walk free, a move that would fuel the unrest roiling the country 
after the autocratic leader's successor was removed in a military coup.

Mubarak,
 in detention since April 2011, was found guilty and sentenced to life 
in prison last year for failing to stop the killing of some 900 
protesters in Egypt's 2011 uprising. His sentence was overturned on 
appeal and he is now being retried, along with his security chief and 
six top police commanders. He is facing a number of other corruption 
charges.
