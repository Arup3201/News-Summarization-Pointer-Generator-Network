Harry Redknapp aside, it will be difficult for most football people not to be excited by Sunday's Manchester United debut for Radamel Falcao against QPR. 

The procession of genuine world-class talent to Spain has seemed like one-way traffic in recent years while the Premier League sat around waiting for the scraps left over from Barcelona and Real Madrid. Latterly, even Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco have been the preferred destination over England.

So even players of international renown and some experience are infected by the vibrancy that the Colombian has brought to the Premier League and to Manchester United, Wayne Rooney included.

‘I’ve seen him play throughout the years and he’s a fantastic player,’ says the United captain. ‘It’s exciting — and also for the Premier League. He could have gone to a number of other clubs but it’s great we’ve got him.’

And given the desperate start the club have made — two points from three games and elimination from the Capital One Cup — the arrival of Falcao, along with Daley Blind, Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo, has provided a renewed sense of optimism at the club.

‘Obviously last season, we all know we were not good enough,’ says Rooney. ‘But the time is now right to get these top players to get us back to where we belong, back to winning titles again. It’s exciting times, it’s interesting times for United. We’ve not got off to the best of starts but we are confident. It’s a great signing. It’s a great statement of intent. And I am looking forward to working with him. Hopefully we can form a great partnership.’

As captain, Rooney will be responsible for ensuring the transition from Monaco to Manchester is smooth. ‘You have to make sure the new players are made to feel welcome,’ said Rooney.

But in terms of how the team are going to play, even Rooney has not quite figured that out yet. ‘Falcao is a world-class player and it’s down to the manager how he chooses to play. He [Louis van Gaal] has myself, Falcao, Robin van Persie, Di Maria, Juan Mata, so it’s a great selection of players for him to pick from.’

Yet amid the sense of euphoria that big-name signings always create, there are ripples of discontent. Eric Harrison, Mike Phelan and Gary Neville have all spoken of their surprise that United sold Danny Welbeck, a youth-team graduate, who understands the club, fans and the area, and recruited a Colombian on loan, a player who has never spent more than two years at a club since he left River Plate in 2009.

To make way for the new arrivals, another youth-team graduate, Tom Cleverley, has also been moved on loan to Aston Villa and over the summer £160million has been spent. It might have transformed some people’s view of United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, with Paul Scholes saying he had done his job ‘brilliantly’ after questioning whether United were capable of finalising the biggest deals.

But for Van Gaal, the man who made his name primarily by promoting young players and not through lavish spending, it looks an unlikely change of direction. Nurturing the youth was his stock in trade at Ajax in the Nineties, where he established his reputation by winning the Champions League in 1995.

And even at the richest clubs such as Barcelona and Bayern Munich he seemed to concern himself more with young players from the academies than with major signings. The manager bristles when the point is put to him, his explanation being that he still believes in youth but that he has sought to disrupt the atmosphere of the dressing room to create a new dynamic.

‘You have seen Tyler Blackett, Jesse Lingard and Reece James playing. When you see my line-ups there are several young players who have played already. So I don’t think I have changed my philosophy, only that we have to change the selection to give a new rhythm in the dressing room,’ he says.

‘When you are there for more than two or three years as a substitute, do you think this is a good thing for the players? No.

Reece James is another young player that Louis van Gaal has given a first-team chance to 

‘My philosophy is that you have to sell those players or send them on loan. Better for them and also better for the atmosphere in the dressing room. So we let go 14 players and we bought six players, so there are eight vacancies for young players. But it depends on the level of the young players at United. I cannot change that. But I have already played with a lot of youngsters so I don’t understand your question.’

He might not put it this way but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Van Gaal feels he has cleared out some dead wood to allow new flowers to blossom.

But there are more seasoned Van Gaal watchers, those who have worked closely with him in the past, who have been surprised by the signals the summer transfer window has sent out. Kenneth Perez was one of Van Gaal’s key players at AZ Alkmaar, the club where Van Gaal restored his reputation by winning the Dutch league in 2009 after failing with the Holland national team in 2002 and his indifferent second spell at Barcelona in 2003.

Perez became close to Van Gaal, is still in touch with him and now works as a pundit for Fox Sports in Holland. ‘I’m really surprised about the players he has bought, the money he has spent, the positions they are in,’ says Perez. ‘Maybe because of the good results in pre-season he thought United were better than they are. For me, from the outside, it looks like he’s not the only one deciding who is coming in.

‘I understand Angel di Maria because Van Gaal is looking at a type and he needs a player like Arjen Robben, who can do something on his own, carry the ball 50 metres passing people. He couldn’t get Robben, so I guess Di Maria was second best. But renting Falcao for that kind of money when you have Van Persie, Rooney and you had Javier Hernandez and Danny Welbeck, is a big surprise.’

Significantly, Van Gaal suggests the spending is not yet over. ‘We have more balance in the squad but not enough balance,’ says the United manager. When pressed on areas which remain out of equilibrium, he said: ‘Obviously the defending part.’

Perhaps at Old Trafford there will be a balance. Sources close to United speak of how he has spoken with enthusiasm about Chris Smalling and Phil Jones, players with whom domestic observers have long since become impatient. And his persistence with Blackett, another who is said to be soaking up Van Gaal’s instructions, the insistence that James Wilson can be his fourth striker, the use of Lingard on the opening day of the season are actions more in line with the Van Gaal of old.

‘That’s his trademark,’ said Perez. ‘He likes to prove you wrong. If you write Smalling is the worst player, he likes to show you: “Hey, I can make Smalling a good player”.

‘The best example was Danny Koevermans at AZ. He wasn’t that good passing or in his first touch. And after four months with the training of Van Gaal, he became brilliant. That was the biggest change I’ve seen, from a player who couldn’t pass to one who was very good.

‘My only worry that Van Gaal would not be a success is because English players are not tactical, clever players. At the moment the back-line don’t push up, so the space between midfield and the defence is too big so everyone can just play in between there. It’s just too easy. It was unbelievable in that first game against Swansea and I doubt they understand what he wants.’

Of course, if he can transform Blackett, Lingard, James and even older players such as Jones and Smalling into significant United defenders, the £160m spent will seem unimportant given the money he has saved the club. But if he can’t, he may just find himself knocking on Woodward’s door again in January asking for more.

Louis van Gaal has a stunning squad to choose from after a summer of spending at Old Trafford but the new United boss has his work cut out choosing a starting XI and keeping those he leaves on the bench happy. 

1. 3-4-1-2

If LVG wants to squeeze the majority of his signings, this is the way to go. But it has Blind in an unfamiliar central role and is ridiculously open in central midfield. Would surely need a Darren Fletcher type in there to shore things up. 

2. 4-3-3

Looks a little more balanced but asking Van Persie and Rooney to run wide for Falcao might not go down terribly well. Rooney will do the job but RVP hasn’t played there since his early days at Arsenal. Still no room for Januzaj.

3. 4-4-2 

A classic Fergie formation — wingers (though you might want Valencia on the right to really get outside players) and two central midfielders who can tackle and pass. But Mata, RVP and Herrera — £75m of talent — are sat on the bench.
