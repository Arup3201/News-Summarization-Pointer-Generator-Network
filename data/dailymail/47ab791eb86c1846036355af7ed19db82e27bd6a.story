It’s been nine months since Activision announced it was working on the next Call of Duty and at midnight last night the first customers finally got their hands on the new game.

This included the UK's keenest gamer Zohair Ali, who was the first person to buy the game at London's Westfield Stratford City, just months after he was the first gamer to buy Grand Theft Auto V from the same store.

Hundreds of stores across the UK opened at midnight for the release of the tenth version in the franchise called Call of Duty: Ghosts.

In some parts of the UK, gamers even queued in temperatures as low as two degrees Celsius to buy the game, worth £44.99.

Kite said: ‘I have been playing Call of Duty for the last 10 years. When I am off work, I play it all the time, about 20 - 30 hours a week. I booked the day off work tomorrow so I can go home and play the new game all night long.’

The store manager at Camden decided to open the shop doors at 11pm, to allow the queue of Call of Duty enthusiasts to wait inside the store, rather than out in the cold.

Some people in the queue at the Game store in Camden explained that such was their dedication to Call of Duty, queuing for the newly released games was a yearly ritual.

Justin Tillock, 31, a stage hand at Shafestbury Theatre, said: ‘This is my sixth year queuing up for the new Call of Duty. I absolutely would not waste my time queuing for any other games. I will go home and unashamedly play the game until sunlight.’

Jon Sheridan, 21, from Camden, added: ‘Queuing up for the new Call of Duty game is a yearly routine for me. I play it about three hours a day, but sometimes all day if I get too addicted.’
