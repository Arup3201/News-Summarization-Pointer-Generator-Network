Sexual predator: Neville Williams, 56, broke into his victim¿s home and raped her. Detectives tracked him down years later and he has been jailed

A man who broke into a teenage mother's home and raped her has been jailed for ten years.

Neville Williams, 56, broke into his victim’s home and boasted it was his birthday as he brutally raped her.

After her ordeal, which happened on October 1, 1999 - Williams’ 42nd birthday - he threatened to return and rape the young mum again if she called police.

The terrified victim, aged 19 at the time, fled her home in Birmingham and resettled in another part of the country to escape the memory of what happened.

But after 12 years of silence she finally went to police in November 2011 and officers launched a search for her attacker.

Specialist teams were able to track Williams after his victim remembered he called himself by his nickname ‘Crunch’.

After his arrest in June last year unemployed Williams denied the attack and went on trial earlier this year.

But a jury found him guilty after hearing evidence from a friend and the woman’s GP about a change in her personality following the attack.

At Birmingham Crown Court, Neville, from Smiths Wood, Solihull, West Midlands, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for life and subjected to a restraining order to protect his victim.

Speaking after the verdict, she said: 'I’m stuck for words. I’m so pleased. I had to double check this morning I wasn’t dreaming.

'Knowing he’s locked away and other girls are safe is the best thing ever.

'I can’t find the right words to express how I feel.'

Detective Chief Inspector Dean Young said West Midlands Police had received reports other woman had been raped by Neville and urged any victims to come forward.

He said: 'I commend the woman for her courage. She is a role model for countless other women who have been assaulted over the years and who have never felt able to tell police officers their story.

'As well as helping secure a lengthy jail term for Williams preventing him from harming others, she will undoubtedly be a source of strength and inspiration for people who are in a situation similar to hers.'

Mr Young also appealed for any other victims to come forward.

'When investigating the assault on this woman, witnesses suggested that other woman had been attacked by Williams but that they had not reported these to police.

'I would appeal directly to anyone who has been assaulted but felt unable to tell us at the time to contact us.

'Your secret will have been a heavy one to bear for all this time. Now is the time to seek help.'
