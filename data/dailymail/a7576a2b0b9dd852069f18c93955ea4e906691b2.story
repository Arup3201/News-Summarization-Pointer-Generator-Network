Exile: The Swiss defender is one of many players to depart Fulham this summer following their relegation

Senderos is set to sign for Villa on a free transfer before linking up with the Swiss squad on Friday.

Ottmar Hitzfeld's side will face Ecuador, France and Honduras in Brazil.

Senderos will add experience to Paul Lambert's side after they struggled to avoid relegation for a second consecutive season, eventually finishing 15th and five points clear of the drop zone.

The defender is likely to link up with Roy Keane who is expected to be named as Lambert's assistant manager at Villa Park after cancelling his plans to work as a pundit for ITV at the World Cup.
