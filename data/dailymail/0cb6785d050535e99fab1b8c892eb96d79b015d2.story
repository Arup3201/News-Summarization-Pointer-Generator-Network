EasyJet has unveiled a new passport-scanning facility on its smartphone app, meaning passengers no longer have to manually type in their details when checking in online.

The new facility allows travellers flying with the budget airline to complete the check-in process by simply taking a picture of their passports.

The upgrade to their award-winning mobile app service, which is available on both iOS and Android phones, means customers can now book, check-in and board flights all via their mobile phone.

Previously, passengers were required to provide Advanced Passenger Information (API) by manually entering their passport number into the easyJet website after booking their flights.

The new facility, operated by validation specialist Jumio, now let users automate the process up to two hours before taking off from one of easyJet's 110 airports.

EasyJet is the first European airline to have such a feature. They says it worked with Jumio on the new service to ensure all customer passports could be recorded 'easily, safely and securely'.

The airline's app, which was recently awarded the Best Mobile Booking Solution prize at the Mobile Travel and Tourism Awards 2014, has already been downloaded more than ten million times.

James Millett, easyJet's Head of Digital, said: 'Our new mobile passport scanning function will save time for the millions of customers who use the app to input their travel documentation details.

The new smartphone app has been designed to help easyJet streamline their check-in services 

'It's another example of innovating to make travel as easy as it is affordable with easyJet.

'We've developed the new function in partnership with credentials management service Jumio to ensure details can be scanned in easily, safely and securely.'

'EasyJet is committed to making travel easier, and this year alone launched a partnership with flightradar24 to track flights on the move and introduced a live update system to connect with travellers.'

Earlier this year, easyJet introduced a new mobile phone service to take passengers through each step of the airport process.

The budget airline began trialling new technology across Luton, Gatwick and Paris Charles de Gaulle airports, with special beacons placed at strategic points to send helpful messages to customers at what it calls 'critical points' of the journey.

Passengers were previously required to enter their Advanced Passenger Information on the easyJet website

As customers approach bag drop, they are advised to open their boarding pass at the right time so it is ready to be scanned and further beacons will send messages to travellers when it is time to present their passport.

The instructions are sent to registered passengers' mobile phones as they pass each strategic 'beacon' placed in the airports.

Any passenger who has downloaded the easyJet app can expect 'helpful' notifications each time they pass the Bluetooth transmitters dotted around the airport.

And the airline deems the trial successful, customers can expect to receive messages at more European airports telling them when to open their passports and show their boarding pass.

easyJet already uses Flight Tracker technology in its app to keep customers up to date with the latest information on their flights.
