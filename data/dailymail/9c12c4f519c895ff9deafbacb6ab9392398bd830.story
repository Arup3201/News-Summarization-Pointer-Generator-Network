Normally the picture of composure, Microsoft chairman revealed his softer side on Tuesday as he choked up during company CEO Steve Ballmer's final shareholders meeting as chief executive today.

The co-founder of the software giant said progress was being made to find Ballmer's replacement and he thanked him for serving as CEO for the last 13 years.

Only Gates and Ballmer have led Microsoft Corp. since its founding 38 years ago.

Gates grew emotional while saying that both he and Ballmer are committed to making sure 'that the next CEO is the right person for the right time for the company we both love.'

Ballmer, who said in August that he would step down within 12 months, was mostly light-hearted at what he called a 'unique and fun meeting.'

One shareholder suggested a U.S. government cabinet post as an information technology secretary be created for Ballmer.

The outgoing CEO replied that he didn't think the job would make sense, adding 'but thank you for trying to help me find work.'

The company, based in Redmond, Washington, said today that all of its proposals were approved.

Board nominees, including Ballmer and Gates, were re-elected with each nominee backed by more than 90 percent of the votes cast.

Gates thanked Ballmer for his 33 years at Microsoft, 13 of them as CEO and made the point that for such a large corporation, it was unusual that there had only been two CEO's - him and Ballmer.

'Steve and I really appreciated all the joys and challenges that came with being CEO,' he said.

'It’s a real privilege to lead the incredibly talented group of employees we have. It’s a privilege to work on the technology that’s changed the world.'

Gates choked up when talking about two other things that he and Ballmer share: 'We’ve got a commitment to make sure that the next CEO is the right person for the right time for the company we both love.

'And we share a commitment that Microsoft will succeed as a company that makes the world a better place.'

Gates said on Tuesday he was pleased with Microsoft Corp's progress in finding a new chief executive but outlined the difficulties in picking the next leader of the world's largest software company as it seeks to reinvent itself as a mobile computing power.

Gates is part of the four-man committee that gave itself a year to find a successor to Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer after he announced his plan to retire in August. Sources close to the process have said the search is down to a handful of candidates, but the company itself has been largely silent.

'We've been doing a lot of meetings with both internal and external candidates and we're pleased with the progress,' said Gates at Microsoft's annual shareholder meeting in Bellevue, Washington.

'We're looking at a number of candidates and I'm not going to give a timeline today.'

Ballmer said in August he planned to retire within 12 months, and the CEO search committee - headed by lead independent director and former IBM executive John Thompson - tasked itself with finding a replacement by the end of that period. Sources close to the company expect an appointment no later than January.

Gates, who in previous years did not address the shareholders' meeting with prepared remarks, went on to describe the challenges of finding the right person to lead Microsoft.

'It's a complex role to fill - a lot of different skills, experience and capabilities that we need,' he said.

'It's a complex global business the new CEO will have to lead. The person has to have a lot of comfort in leading a highly technical organization and have an ability to work with our top technical talent to seize the opportunities.'

Indeed, few CEOs wielded more power than Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer.

And yet the company's first and foremost salesman never gained the respect he deserved for his role in transforming Bill Gates' tiny startup in the woods outside Seattle into the world's largest software maker.

Ballmer had the misfortune to follow megastar Gates at the helm just as the company hit the end of its explosive growth period and faced a resurgent Apple Inc under an inspired Steve Jobs.

The Detroit native, who met Gates at Harvard, was doubly unfortunate that his ascent to the CEO office in January 2000 came just weeks before the bursting of the dot.com stock bubble, from which Microsoft's share price never recovered.

Although Ballmer did treble revenues at Microsoft during his time in charge, and managed to steer the company away from obscurity or crisis that befell other tech firms, he consistently attracted criticism for management miscues.

Under his watch, Apple and Google Inc roared past Microsoft in the emerging arena of Internet search, smartphones and tablets, which made the software company look stodgy and behind-the-times.

'He tried hard. Nobody can doubt his commitment to Microsoft,' said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. "The missing element was execution."

His attempt to catch up was a failed $47 billion bid for fading internet giant Yahoo Inc in 2008, a company which is now worth much less. Yahoo's inexplicable decision to reject the deal probably saved Ballmer's job.

Ballmer never lacked passion and energy for the company he helped to build, but he was always more of a salesman and cheerleader than a technology visionary.

'That is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn't appeal to business customers,' Ballmer laughed in a TV interview after the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007. Five years later, iPhone sales alone were greater than Microsoft's overall revenue.

A clip of a semi-hysterical Ballmer screeching and dancing around the stage to rally Microsoft employees has been viewed nearly five million times on YouTube, gaining him the nickname 'Monkey Boy'. And his hypnotic and slightly unhinged mantra of 'developers, developers, developers', captured at another company conference, made him the butt of jokes for years after.

A natural math whiz from Michigan, Ballmer met Gates at Harvard before Gates dropped out to co-found Microsoft in 1975.

Five years later, Gates persuaded Ballmer to drop out of Stanford Business School to become Microsoft's first commercial manager, and only the company's 30th employee, giving him an 8 percent stake.

As Microsoft's first salesman, rather than a techie, he was viewed with some distrust.

'The first time we met face-to-face, I thought this guy looks like an operative for the NKVD (Soviet police),' recalled Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in his memoir.

'He had piercing blue eyes and a genuine toughness. Though as I got to know him better, I found a gentler side as well.'

Allen said that the young Ballmer - a zealous basketball player and jogger - would wake him up at 7 a.m. doing push-ups in their shared hotel room on early business trips.

As Microsoft engineered the personal computer revolution through the 80s and 90s, the sales side of the organization grew in size and importance, led by the charismatic Ballmer - unmistakable on campus and at industry meetings with his shiny bald dome, strapping physique and booming voice.

In Microsoft-speak, employees were either a 'Bill guy', meaning a technology person, or a 'Steve guy', meaning a sales and marketing person.

When Ballmer, known internally as SteveB, took over from Gates as Microsoft CEO in 2000, some saw it as the triumph of sales over technology and innovation, which ultimately ruined the company.

'I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft,' former Apple CEO Jobs is quoted as saying in his biography.

'The quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen.'

Jobs was partially correct. Under Ballmer's watch, Microsoft missed the shift to smartphones and tablets, and its share price has been static for the last decade.

All the while, Ballmer tended to push out any executives who threatened his power.

'His (Ballmer's) continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft's stock,' prominent hedge fund investor David Einhorn said in 2011, as he campaigned publicly for Ballmer's ouster. Microsoft shares rose 7 percent on the news of Ballmer's retirement on Friday.

But Ballmer's record as a CEO was not as bad as many think. People close to him say his loud public persona belied a quietly shrewd business mind, and he managed Microsoft as well as anyone could as the company reached a mature stage.

He boosted Microsoft's revenues and more than doubled its already large profits. He outlasted erstwhile rivals such as Novell and Sun Microsystems, which have now all-but disappeared, and avoided the boardroom fiascos of Hewlett-Packard or dramatic decline of AOL.

'I don't see anybody else on the management team at Microsoft that I think would be much better than Ballmer,' said Eric Jackson at hedge fund Ironfire Capital.
