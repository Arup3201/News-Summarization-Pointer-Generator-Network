In court: Angela Owen, 46, pleaded guilty at Bradford Crown Court to concealing the birth and preventing the burial of the child, whose body was found in 2006

A 46-year-old woman has admitted secretly giving birth to a stillborn baby boy and burying his body in a bin liner in the grounds of a 300-year-old mansion once owned by an Emmerdale actor.

Angela Owen pleaded guilty to concealing the birth and preventing the burial of the child, whose body was found in 2006 by workmen at Howroyd Hall, near Halifax in West Yorkshire.

Owen, who had not been seen since 2004 and was arrested in Somerset earlier this year after an appeal on BBC Crimewatch, also pleaded guilty to a number of fraud charges.

Those related to using different names in order to obtain a car, a passport, a driving licence and financial services. Owen spoke to confirm her name and enter pleas at Bradford Crown Court.

Owen, who appeared in court with dyed red hair, a grey coat and pink striped scarf, admitted trying to conceal the birth of the child, between 2001 and 2006, by secretly disposing of the dead body.

She also pleaded guilty to preventing the lawful burial between the same dates by putting the baby boy’s body in a black plastic bin liner and concealing it in the grounds of Howroyd Hall, in Barkisland.

Owen used the name Angela Hobson to obtain a Lotus Elise car by deception, from November 2002 to December 2003 - and Co-op Bank credit services, from October 2002 to January 2003.

She used the name Emma Smith to run a pub in Oldham, Greater Manchester, between December 2003 and January 2004 - and to try to get a driving licence in January 2004.

Forensics tent: Workmen dug up the body in the garden of Howroyd Hall, near Halifax, in July 2006, which used to belong to Emmerdale actor Richard Thorp. The actor sold it more than a decade before the baby was found

She claimed to be Carla Geissler to try to get a passport in March 2004. In April 2003, she made off from a Huddersfield hotel, without paying for £325.40 of accommodation, food and telephone calls.

Owen, of Glastonbury, Somerset, pleaded not guilty to four charges, including obtaining property or services by deception and conspiracy to obtain property by deception.

'Miss Owen says that she was a victim of domestic violence at the hands of a former partner and the majority of her actions were the result of his behaviour'

Christopher Tehrani, prosecutor

But prosecutor Christopher Tehrani said no trial will sought on the counts with not guilty pleas.

He said Owen had entered a basis of plea that she committed the crimes as she was a domestic violence victim. He said the Crown did not accept this at the moment and would probe the claims.

‘Miss Owen says that she was a victim of domestic violence at the hands of a former partner and the majority of her actions were the result of his behaviour,’ Mr Tehrani said.

Workmen dug up the baby’s body of in the garden of Howroyd Hall in July 2006, which used to be owned by Emmerdale’s Richard Thorp, who played Alan Turner in the soap for more than 25 years.

Mr Thorp sold the house more than a decade before the discovery of the baby and Owen had been living there before the body was found. A post-mortem found it was a newborn, full-term baby boy.

West Yorkshire Police said the death was not suspicious but appealed for help to find Owen. Before her arrest this year, Owen was last seen in June 2004 when she visited the Weston-super-Mare area.

She was known to have many aliases, including Ann Hall and Helen Gee. An appeal to find Owen was issued on Crimewatch in May this year. She was arrested in Avon and Somerset a short time later.

Owen will appear before Bradford Crown Court again on December 14.
