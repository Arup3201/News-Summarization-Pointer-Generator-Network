Somewhere in this performance was a message from Brendan Rodgers and this Liverpool team. It was defiant and even dizzying at times.

In a week when just about every bad statistic going has been used to bash Rodgers around the head, Liverpool are Capital One Cup semi-finalists.

This performance, played at breakneck speed and designed to blow Eddie Howe’s tactical strategy into the English channel, was a reminder that Liverpool can still put teams away.

The next test comes by so quickly, when Arsenal travel to Anfield on Sunday, but for once we have to give this team 24 hours to reflect on a place in the last four. It is the least they deserve.

Soon enough they will be under the spotlight again, but this was a gutsy display and at least temporarily lifted the gloom that has enveloped this club.

They were 3-0 up, thanks to the two goals dutifully put away by Raheem Sterling and the sweetest cushioned volley by Lazar Markovic, before Bournemouth really knew what had happened to them.

They are Championship leaders for a reason, but Rodgers and his team had ripped them apart here before Dan Gosling got on the scoresheet with a fortunate goal.

Brad Jones’ clumsy mistake provoked inevitable scrutiny over the decision to promote the Australian over Simon Mignolet, but that was not the story of Dean Court.

Instead it is the powers of recovery of those in yellow, the ability to put the 3-0 savaging at Old Trafford behind them to run out convincing winners here.

Take Steven Gerrard, for example. Here he had presence, was full of purpose in his running and looked something like his old self again alongside Lucas Leiva and Jordan Henderson. Long may it continue. Liverpool were superior in every department, working over this aspirational south-coast side with a ruthless blend of finishing and determination.

There were a staggering 51 passes in the build up to Sterling’s opener, a head-turning move that left Bournemouth’s defence utterly bewildered.

Such was the speed it was hard to keep up, but eventually Lazar Markovic swung a cross in from the left for Jordan Henderson to head back across Artur Boruc’s goal.

This time Sterling, who was denied three times by Manchester United keeper David de Gea in Sunday’s defeat, applied the finishing touch with a deft header.

That was a team move, the ethos that Rodgers has been trying to promote at Anfield during a wretched run that has already brought them seven league defeats.

What a lesson for Howe, the young Bournemouth manager in charge of a team that put eight past Birmingham City at St Andrew’s earlier in the season and scored five in their victory over Cardiff last Saturday.

Callum Wilson knows he should have put Bournemouth ahead, tricking his way into the Liverpool area in the opening minutes before he rolled his effort well wide Jones’ post.

After that, this Bournemouth team simply invited Liverpool to put pressure on them in every area of this rain-soaked playing surface.

Adam Smith, Eunan O’Kane, Junior Stanislas and Matt Ritchie did some decent things in patches, but this game was played by Liverpool at full pelt. It seemed as though they had scores to settle.

There was a whiff of controversy about the second because some dopey fool in the Bournemouth crowd who blew a whistle, causing captain Tommy Elphick to check his defensive run when Coutinho was about to shoot.

From the rebound Markovic was perfectly placed just inside the penalty area to cushion a side volley into the net. Rodgers is persisting with this three-man defence. He is short of a controlling influence in there, but they have plenty of muscle with Kolo Toure, Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren protecting Jones.

They eased off occasionally, allowing Yann Kermogrant the chance to pull a goal back for Bournemouth immediately after Markovic’s strike. He missed and you felt then that this would not be one of those famous midweek Cup nights.

There was no let up from Liverpool. They operated at a different level and whenever Bournemouth’s defence drifted off, Sterling was there to take advantage.

He scored his second in the 51st minute, rinsing Elphick inside the penalty area before his cute touch lost Boruc at the far post.

There was a brief moment when this raucous crowd could finally get on their feet, roaring their approval when Gosling, a former Everton midfielder, pulled a goal back for Bournemouth.

It was an error of judgment by Jones, the man entrusted with the gloves after Rodgers revealed on Sunday that he would be first choice for the foreseeable future.

Even after Gosling hit the post with another chance, there was the sense that not even Liverpool could throw this away.

Reaching a semi-final of the Capital One Cup, particularly after last Tuesday’s ignominious exit from the Champions League, feels like progress.

Remarkably, a season of transition could still end with a trophy.
