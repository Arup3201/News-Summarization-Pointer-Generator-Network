British Airways has launched an investigation after an offensive and racist message was apparently retweeted from its Twitter account.

The official BA Twitter account, which has 210,000 followers, reposted the message which included extremely profane language and a racist term against Asian people, on Saturday afternoon.

After the offensive message was deleted, staff at the airline then tweeted an apology.

Racist message: The official BA Twitter account, which has 210,000 followers, reposted a message which included extremely profane language and a racist term against Asian people, on Saturday afternoon

Sorry: The message was immediately deleted and an apology published. The airline has now launched a full investigation

It said: 'Apologies for the last RT. We are sorry for any offence caused and are investigating how this may have happened.'

The incident started when a message was posted by a disgruntled Twitter user named Jae Jang Ladd who tweeted: '@British_Airways F*** you. F***** cancelling my flight! #bunchofc****'

Another user of the social networking site tweeting under the name Asian Ronaldo, replied '@jaeladd @British_Airways F*** you. F***** cancelling my flight! #bunchofc****', go back to your f****** country you g***

This message was then retweeted by the official BA Twitter account.

Within minutes, hundreds of Twitters users resent the retweet and later more than 160 followers had retweeted the apology.

A BA spokesman said the team were thoroughly investigating how the incident had occurred.

She said it had not been ruled out that the account may have been hacked.

She said: 'We don't know yet how this has evolved.

'We'd just like to apologise for any offence caused.'

She said that police had not been in touch over the post and as yet there had been no official complaints.

BA said the Twitter account was managed by its large marketing team.

The airline has been ridiculed online by other Twitter users.

PR agency founder Andrew Bloch said: 'Whoever runs the British Airways twitter feed is going to be in trouble...'
