Aussie company, Buderim Ginger, launched Australia's Hottest Ginger competition in November, and received over 2000 flame-haired entrants, all vying for the prize pool of over $10,000.

The company launched the competition to celebrate all things ginger, and break down the walls of 'gingerism' by inviting people to enter themselves, their red-headed pet, or their best ginger moustache or beard for the public vote.

After thousands of entrants, the results are in for the male and female contestants, with four fiery-locked finalists competing for the final title of 'Australia's Hottest Ginger'.

For the ladies section, Perth girl Bec Mountford, 18, and Sydney woman Indeya Passfield made the cut for the Hottest Gingers in Australia.

Bec describes herself as a 'proud ginger', and entered the competition after being convinced by a friend.

Indeya, based in Randwick in Sydney, described herself as a 'red-headed fireball who it intent on doing something good.'

'I was super surprised when I got the phone call to say I was a finalist. There were so many amazing entries and different types of ginger, it was so awesome to be selected,' Indeya said

'It's a great way to celebrate something that hasn't been in the spotlight. But putting four of us in the one room, our natural fiery competitive spirit is bound to come out,' Indeya said

'I don't think ginger has necessarily been celebrated before. It's very cool, it gives gingers a chance to get one up on everyone else,' Indeya told Daily Mail Australia.

'I definitely think we are a superior breed,' Indeya joked.

In the men's section, Sydney-based veterinarian Nicholas Glen and Brisbane lad Nick Cox made the top of the ginger list.

Nicholas, 30, described himself as a 'born and bred ginger', and is excited and nervous about the final announcement in a few weeks.  

Nick Cox, 20, who is from Lutwyche in Brisbane, said he entered the competition as he is the younger brother of a blond surfer and that he was here 'to show him up'.

The People's Choice Winner is Bailey Hart, who received the most votes in the online competition

Indeya told Daily Mail Australia that she was excited to see red-heads celebrated, and that there was 'a whole new wheel of colour dedicated to it, from freckles and blue eyes, to dark eyes and dark features'.

'It's a great way to celebrate something that hasn't been in the spotlight. But putting four of us in the one room, our natural fiery competitive spirit is bound to come out,' Indeya said.  

The People's Choice Winner is Bailey Hart, who received the most votes in the online competition. 

Bailey, 27, is a competitive pole dancer, and said that she 'loved being called a ranga,' and that she 'wouldn't trade this feature for anything in the world'.
