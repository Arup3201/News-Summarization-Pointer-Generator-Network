Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has admitted he was envious of watching other clubs compete in the Champions League in the last few years.

The Reds are back in Europe's premier club competition, following their runners-up finish in the Barclays Premier League last season, for the first time since the 2009/10 campaign.

Gerrard, who inspired Liverpool to glory in the competition in 2005, is understandably champing at the bit to once again compete against the best players the continent has to offer.

And he has revealed missing the last few editions, as Liverpool went though a difficult period, had been a wrench.

'I've missed it so much. There's almost a jealousy when you watch the Champions League and you're not involved in it,' the 34-year-old told Liverpool's official website.

'It's a horrible thing to do - you want to be part of it. It's the ultimate competition. I'm just as excited as any supporter and anyone connected to the club. I can't wait for it to start.'

The five-time winners have been drawn in a group with defending champions Real Madrid along with Swiss side Basle and Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets.

Gerrard acknowledges they face stern opposition, and not just from the Spanish giants, but is optimistic they can reach the knockout stages.

'It's a tough group and there are some tough games in there, but it's an exciting group and certainly a group that we can progress from. That's the key. The first challenge is to get out of the group,' he said.

Gerrard is, however, relishing the double-header with Carlo Ancelotti's Real.

He added: 'They were one of the sides that all of the players wanted, and certainly the supporters. The supporters can't wait to get over to Madrid and have a good time.

'For us, it's a chance to go and compete against the best. We're not in this competition to make the numbers up; we're not celebrating and going out to enjoy this competition - we want to compete and go as far as we can.'
