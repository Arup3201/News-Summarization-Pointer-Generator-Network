A surprise visit from a health inspector led to an unusual discovery at a Mexican restaurant when he came across an entire deer stuffed in the freezer.

Los Alamos Market in Kansas City, Missouri was temporarily shut down last Friday after the carcass - complete with head, antlers and hooves - was found in the kitchen storage unit.

The restaurant's owner explained that he was holding the frozen beast as a favor for a friend.

Oh deer: A health inspector came across this carcass at the Los Alamos Market restaurant in Kansas City last week - and shut the establishment down

Call of the wild: The surprise discovery led to the premises being shut after the inspector visited during the lunchtime rush

The inspector said the deer may have been roadkill but he could not be certain.

Jeff Hershberger from the city health board, told KCTV that live and dead cockroaches were also found inside the restaurant.

In total, there were 13 health code violations including employees not washing their hands correctly and dishes not cleaned to a proper standard. The deer, however, was the main reason behind the closure. 

Mr Hershberger said: 'It still had the head, the hooves, the horns, the skin.'

While it is not illegal to pick up roadkill - although it is risky - the health inspector said it was not allowed to be served in restaurants.

Los Alamos owner Agustin Juarez told the local TV station that staff had been caught at a bad time during the lunch time rush. He had been keeping the deer in storage for a customer but has now removed it from the premises and got rid of the freezer.

Of the deer in his freezer, he added: 'My luck was we got the health inspector the next day.'

Mr Juarez said that although he had lost money during the temporary closure, the experience had taught him a lesson.
