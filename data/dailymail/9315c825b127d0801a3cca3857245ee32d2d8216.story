'So excited': Saiba Khatoon (pictured) was stabbed to death at her home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after announcing that she was four months pregnant

A traumatised boy of seven was being comforted last night after his mother was stabbed to death just days after telling friends she was expecting a baby.

Saiba Khatoon, 26, was knifed at her family home after revealing she was almost four months pregnant.

The alarm was raised when her son was woken by a smoke alarm late at night and ran out of the house to get help from neighbours.

One went into the house to find carer Mrs Khatoon lying dead in a downstairs room.

Police were today questioning a 30-year old taxi driver believed to be a boyfriend of the dead woman on suspicion of murder.

The
tragedy in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, occurred just days after Mrs 
Khatoon, whose estranged husband worked as a doctor had excitedly 
announced her pregnancy news to friends and neighbours.

Friend Elisha Barnes, 26, said: 'Saiba came round to my house and was so excited about her news.

'You
could see it in her face and her eyes. She had been trying for a baby 
for quite a while, but she had had several miscarriages in the past.

'She seemed absolutely delighted she was 18 weeks gone and was really looking forward to becoming a mum again.

'When
we saw Saiba at the weekend she said she was very happy and said she 
would find out whether it was a boy or girl in two weeks' time.'

She said they became friends when Mrs Khatoon moved into her house about four years ago.

'She was a lovely lady. You couldn't ask for a better friend,' she added.

'She was a carer for the disabled and was very kind. It's not sunk in yet. Her car is still outside and it will only be when it's gone that it starts to sink in. It's not right and I can't believe it.'

She said Mrs Khatoon had a big family who were often at the house.

Police said officers were called just before midnight on Monday, May 7 by the North West Ambulance Service following reports a woman had been found with stab wounds.

Officers attended and discovered the body. A post mortem has not yet taken place.

Another neighbour said: 'Saiba's son inadvertently raised the alarm and ran to a neighbour's house and started banging on the door and letterbox.

'We believe Saiba had been seeing a man on and off since she was 16, but her family didn't approve of him.

'She was later married in an arranged marriage to a doctor, but the marriage failed and she began seeing this man again.

'At one time, there was a big row at the house and police were called, but we noticed he was back on the scene again.'

A third neighbour Mr Amar Hussain, 28, said: 'Saiba has no enemies and I find it hard to believe someone would want to harm her. She had a heart of gold.

'She was looking forward to her birthday which was in a few days. She would have been 27. She always had a beautiful smile and wouldn't give anything away even if there was something wrong.'

Another neighbour Mrs Paula Tuck said: 'It's horrible to think that something like this has happened. I knew something was going on as I heard some commotion just before midnight when my husband came to bed.'

A bouquet of flowers stood as a lone tribute to the young mother-of-one.

Two police officers manned the house while forensic teams carry out their investigations.

A forensic tent has been erected in the garden of the semi-detached house.

Chief Insp Mark Bell of GMP's Rochdale division, said: 'A young woman has tragically been killed and we have officers supporting her loved ones at this difficult time.

'I want to reassure the community that a team of detectives have been working tirelessly throughout the night and have acted quickly to make an arrest.'

He added: 'We are very much in the early stages of this investigation but if anyone has any information that could help us I would urge them to get in touch.

'The incident will undoubtably cause some concern in the local community and there will be extra officers in and around the area today.

'If any residents want to raise any concerns or pass on information I would encourage them to come and talk to us.'
