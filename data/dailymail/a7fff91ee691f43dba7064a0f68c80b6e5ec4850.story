Should Ross Barkley start for England at the World Cup?

Wayne Rooney dominates the headlines. After a rusty display against Peru, followed by Roy Hodgson’s decision to use him out wide against Ecuador, a debate has started: will he — or won’t he — start alongside Daniel Sturridge when Italy stand in front of England in Manaus?

Even if Rooney was on top form, I wouldn’t play him in the second striker’s position. It’s a supporting role to Sturridge but, more importantly, it includes the job of nullifying Andrea Pirlo.

Rooney was given that task in the Euro 2012 quarter-final, alongside Andy Carroll, and could not lay a glove on the veteran playmaker.

Side by side: But what roles will Wayne Rooney (left) and Daniel Sturridge fill for England?

People talk about Rooney’s best role being off the front, but I’ve never gone along with that theory. Of course, he can do it. He’s done it to great effect for club and country over the years, but when I think of the best I’ve seen Rooney, it was the 2009-10 season.

Then, he scored 34 goals and won the PFA Player of the Year award as an out-and-out striker.

Don’t forget, Sir Alex Ferguson used Danny Welbeck as a second striker, rather than Rooney, to stop Xabi Alonso against Real Madrid in the Champions League the season before last. Alonso is Madrid’s Pirlo.

It’s not a
 matter of a lack of workrate from Wayne. In fact, I think he actually 
works too hard at times. And I’m not jumping on the ‘drop Rooney’ 
bandwagon either, but for tactical reasons I’d rather see a midfielder 
being asked to pester Pirlo.

Having Adam Lallana, say, or Ross Barkley in there, with a midfielder’s mentality, would be more solid than having a striker dropping off from deeper.

They would normally have Pirlo in front of them so they can see him — Rooney would be checking over his  shoulder — and both have the  ability to run past the Italian.

Don’t forget, also, that the gifted young Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti will also be looking to cause problems for  England. Neither he nor Pirlo can be given space to create.

A striker will, at times, be 20 to 30 yards away from Pirlo with a lot of ground to make up — and has Wayne got enough fitness to do that job in these conditions?

It may seem harsh when Rooney is the fifth highest goalscorer in England’s history after he scored against Ecuador in Miami, along with six goals in eight games in the qualifying programme, but Sturridge is currently the best option to play at centre forward. That means Wayne has to play wide.

This, though, does not mean he is filling a limited, defensive role. Quite the opposite, in fact. He would be asked to attack from the left, like Luis Suarez does for  Uruguay. There is a big difference with that job compared to a left midfielder.

Talk has been about Sturridge and Rooney creating a partnership similar to the Liverpool pairing of Sturridge and Suarez. I’ve watched them a lot this season and they have been lethal with their goals in the Barclays Premier League, but I wouldn’t say there was great  chemistry between them.

In the mix: Ross Barkley (left) should be deployed to thwart the inspirational Pirlo

They are two top strikers, but it is too simplistic to say they played as a pair all season. When Liverpool used a back three and a diamond formation, both systems give you the numbers in the centre of the park and allow you to play a front two.

The diamond would be my choice against Italy, with Rooney and Sturridge supported by Barkley or Lallana to choke the space around Pirlo.

I doubt Raheem Sterling will be included, given that he has played so little in the warm-up games. But it looks like Roy will deploy two sitting midfielders with three supporting a single striker (Sturridge) in a 4-2-3-1 system.

Another question for the management would be: do they believe Rooney and Sturridge can complete those three group games in nine days and in these conditions? I don’t believe they can.

Having worked with Daniel, he is prone to a niggle between games and that could mean missing vital tactical sessions or missing the next game.

Rooney has been criticised for his performances in tournaments since Portugal 2004. I don’t think his ability is in question, more his adaptability to play in those  conditions at the end of a season.

There have been plenty of times when I’ve seen him looking shattered as we’ve struggled to keep the ball, and he’s chasing shadows.

With three games in quick succession, what would Sir Alex Ferguson, Jose Mourinho or Arsene Wenger do at club level towards the end of a season? They would rotate. We never do it, as there’s a fear that if it goes wrong, the manager will be hung out to dry. But the manager needs to make bold decisions.

Plenty to ponder: Roy Hodgson must decide where best to use Rooney

Rooney and Sturridge with Welbeck as a front three gives versatility and unpredictability. They can all play from the flanks or through the middle, so there can be lots of interchanging, which would mean Italy could never relax.

Rooney and Sturridge are two of the best players in the squad and I have no doubt they could be dangerous as a pair, but in the biggest games against top opposition I don’t think there’s room for both through the middle.

Roy has a reputation for playing it safe but I feel this tournament is about being brave with selection and changes from the bench.
