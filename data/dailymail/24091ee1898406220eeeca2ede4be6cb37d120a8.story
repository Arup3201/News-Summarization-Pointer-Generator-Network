Oliver Dowden, the Prime Minister's deputy chief of staff, said he spent most of his day on 'crisis management'

One of David Cameron’s top aides has admitted spending most of his time on 'crisis management' after finding out what is happening in politics by listening to the radio.

Oliver Dowden, nicknamed 'Olive' by colleagues in Downing Street, revealed he was 'surprised' on a daily basis by the behaviour of people in government.

He used an interview in America to reveal he listens to Radio 4 each morning to 'hear what’s going on' before deciding what soundbites to feed to Britain’s ‘aggressive' media.

The candid remarks will fuel the impression that Mr Cameron's young team in Number 10 struggles to get a grip on the news agenda.

Party grandee Lord Tebbit said at the weekend: ‘The abiding sin of the 
government is not that some ministers are rich, but that it seems unable
 to manage its affairs competently.’

Mr Dowden, who studied law at Cambridge, said: 'I’m surprised on a day-to-day basis. There is no accounting for the conduct of individuals.

‘Most of my time is spent on day-to-day crisis management, ’ he Dowden told an American public broadcaster last month.

‘We’re not permanently in crisis, but dealing with the issues that arise on a day-to-day basis.’

Last week positive headlines for the government on falling unemployment, crime, inflation and NHS waiting times were overshadowed by a string of self-inflicted PR wounds.

Mr Cameron’s pledge to force energy companies to put customers on the cheapest tariff unravelled, MPs’ expenses re-emerged in a fresh scandal on renting out homes and Defence Minister Andrew Robathan tried to get veterans from the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers thrown out of Parliament for clapping during a debate.

On Friday night Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell finally resigned, more than four weeks after swearing at Downing Street police who told him to get off his bike.

Hours earlier Chancellor George Osborne faced claims he was travelling in a First Class train carriage with a standard ticket and had to pay £189.50 for an upgrade.

Both Old Etonians, Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne have repeatedly face accusations of being out-of-touch.

Mr Mitchell was replaced as Chief Whip by Sir George Young, who also went to Eton.

Mr Dowden, who studied law at Cambridge University, was deputy campaigns director of the Conservative Party before joining lobbying firm Hill and Knowlton in 2007.

A year later he returned to work as deputy director, political operations, reporting Andy Coulson.

Number
 10 has repeatedly been criticised for apparently failing to predict the
 direction of major news stories and appearing slow to react.

Mr Cameron today revealed his exasperation at positive news stories being over-shadowed by government crises.

The
 PM said: 'We need to focus on the big picture. What actually happened 
last week is that unemployment fell, inflation fell, waiting lists in 
our hospitals fell, crime fell, the right decision was made about Gary 
McKinnon.

'Those are the 
important things that are happening in an economy where we've created a 
million private sector jobs in the last two years.

'There
 will always be people that will go on endlessly about process and 
processology and Kremlinology and all the rest of it, what actually 
matters is what is happening out there.'

Andrew Mitchell resigned as Chief Whip on Friday, a month after a foul-mouthed rant at Downing Street police

Asked why it took a month for Mr 
Mitchell to quit after his notorious confrontation with police in 
Downing Street, Mr Cameron replied: 'It's the easiest thing in the world
 as Prime Minister to just sack someone at the drop of a hat when 
something goes wrong.

'I thought the right thing to do was to make sure there was a proper apology.'

David Cameron has faced heavy criticism for a lack of direction in Downing Street

Mr Dowden is the Prime Minister's 
deputy chief of staff, working under Chief of Staff Ed Llewellyn.

Mr Dowden revealed he finds out what is 
happening by listening to Radio 4. He said: ‘Of course, the first thing I
 do in the morning, if I’m not woken up by my very young children, I 
turn on the Today programme and hear what’s going on.

‘Hopefully we will have some sense of what’s coming up anyway, but often you’ll get surprised by what’s going on and working out with our media team about how we respond to that.’

Today the Prime Minister's official spokesman joked that he had 'offered to send him the grid' from Downing Street of the announcements and main news events happening each day.

Asked if Mr Cameron is constantly surprised by the headlines, the spokesman added: 'All of us are surprised on occasion by what is happening in the news.'

Mr Dowden works on ‘lines to take’ – soundbites handed to minsters and senior MPs on what Conservative party’s position is on the big issues of the day.

In opposition he was part of the team which looked at all the expense claims of Tory MPs, which lead to several being demoted or forced to stand down.

He said there was a ‘difficult balance to strike’ between press regulation and press freedom.

‘Much as we suffer at the hands of our aggressive press, that is a vital part of our democratic process,’ he added.

He also admitted to being surprised at the ‘scale and speed’ of the London riots and said youth unemployment has been a problem ‘for a very long time’.
