Google has another new logo, but can you spot the change? Hint - it's nearly identical to its predecessor.

The search giant’s latest corporate logo has a tiny difference that’s nearly imperceptible to the naked eye.

Spacing in the second ‘g’ and the ‘l’ has been slightly tweaked to give make it look more evenly positioned for smaller screens, according to a Google spokesperson.

In with the new: Can you spot the difference?

The letter ‘g’ has been moved one pixel to the right.

And the ‘l’ has been moved one pixel down and another to the right.

Eagle-eyed Reddit users first flagged the updated look Sunday.

Google did not publicize the change as they sometimes have in the past.

The look is much cleaner than the search engine's original logo, but not a major departure from its predecessor.

The search giant did the alteration in-house and claimed in a statement to MailOnline that it has a much bigger purpose than its scale would imply.

A Google spokesperson said that the company 'tweaked the logo a little while ago to make sure it looks its sharpest regardless of your screen resolution.'

MailOnline staffers polled while viewing the Google homepage on a mobile device did not notice a difference between the old and new logo.
