Alexis Houston, who is often billed as Whitney's half-sister, has been branded a fake by the late singer's family

It is a headline-grabbing musical connection any singer would envy: to be closely related to soul diva Whitney Houston.

But although Alexis Houston  – who has performed at a gala  for Prince Charles’s charity the Prince’s Trust – is often billed as the late star’s half-sister, Whitney’s family have branded her a fake.

What’s more, it seems that Alexis may have been born 13 years earlier than she claims .  .  . and male.

Whitney’s long-time publicist Jill Fritzo said the family maintain that ‘Alexis is no relation whatsoever to Whitney and are sorry that this person continues to misuse the Houston name.

'Everyone knows that Whitney did not have a sister’.

Alexis, who has appeared on ITV’s This Morning and toured the UK, says on her website that she began to sing as a child at the same church in Newark, New Jersey, where Whitney found her voice.

But Bahamas-based musician Gary Haase says he knows her as Wellington Stuart, son of local singer Wendell Stuart.

According to court reports, Whitney sued a man by the name of Wellington Stuart in 1996 for claiming to be her cousin, although the outcome of the case is uncertain.

And in 2001, a Wellington Houston, described in the press as Whitney’s cousin, issued a demo CD titled All’s Well.

The label that released Alexis’s 2010 album Speak Love-Live Lessons is also called All’s Well Music.

Last night, Jacob Ascher, who runs Alexis’s company, insisted she was Whitney’s half-sister, and born female.

Reports suggest Alexis, who claims Whitney (pictured) found her voice in a New Jersey church, was actually born a man 13 years earlier than she claims

He said that although Alexis’s mother, Marjorie, was married to Wendell Stuart, her dad was entertainment executive John Houston, Whitney’s father.

‘She was always Alexis Houston,’ he said.

‘Wellington Stuart was the son of Wendell. It makes no sense that Alexis was born a man. She was born in 1984  or 1985 in the US and had the same dad as Whitney.

'There has been a lot of vitriol between family members but Alexis has her own talent and she does not need to ride on Whitney’s coat-tails.’
