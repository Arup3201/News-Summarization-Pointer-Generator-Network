Small town horror: Amateur detective Jessica Fletcher, played by Angela Lansbury, encounters a shockingly large number of killings in Murder, She Wrote

The idyllic seaside town of Cabot Cove looks at first glance like a pleasant and relaxing place to live.

In fact, it is the murder capital of the world and far more dangerous than the most violent parts of the globe, including Honduras in Central America.

Thankfully, it is just the fictional New England setting for popular TV series Murder, She Wrote.

Amateur detective Jessica Fletcher, played by Angela Lansbury, encountered a total of 274 killings in the small town in Maine, despite it having a population of just 3,500.

This gives it an annual murder rate of 1,490 per million — more than 50 per cent higher than Honduras, where it is 910 per million.

In the last two years 1,000 women have been murdered in the country - and 90 percent were not even investigated.

And Cabot Cove was even further ahead
 of El Salvador, a country which recently celebrated a unique milestone -
 its first day in three years when nobody was murdered.

Around five people were murdered in the fictional coastal spot every year, according to BBC Radio 4's More or Less.

ITV detective series Midsomer Murders also has an exceptionally high murder rate, on a par with Chile and Latvia.

Researchers
 working out the figures assumed the county of Midsomer, where the 
action was set, would probably have a similar population size to 
Oxfordshire, where it is filmed.

They then worked out that it would have an annual murder rate of 32 per million.

That is three times the rate that Thames Valley Constabulary reports for Oxfordshire.

Midsomer experiences around 2.6 killings per episode over around eight episodes a year, meaning 21 murders were committed there each year.

The reality: Soldiers flee clashes with civilians after a deadly prison battle in Honduras

Los Angeles in the 1970s was the setting for many popular crime series - yet these shows had a far lower murder rate than the city did in reality.

Columbo, Quincy, Perry Mason, Jim 
Rockford and Jonathan and Jennifer Hart all hunted killers on LA's mean 
streets during that decade.

The murder rate across all those series was 29 per million, while in real life, it was 230 per million.

Busy patch: The ratio of killings in British series Midsomer Murders, featuring new character DCI John Barnaby, is closer to that of countries such as Chile and Latvia than Oxfordshire, where it is filmed

As David Crawford writes in the Radio Times: 'If you want reassurance that the world is
 not such a frightening place, watch an American, urban detective drama 
from the 70s.

'But if you want the beejaysus scaring out of you, watch 
Angela Lansbury.'

The findings were calculated by Open University statisticians for Radio 4 mathematics programme 'More or Less'.
