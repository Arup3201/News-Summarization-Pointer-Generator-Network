It has been used by Britons to add a bit of zing to their food for almost 200 years.

But Worcester sauce is losing out as our passion for hotter dishes grows.

Figures show that for the first time sales of chilli sauce have overtaken those of Worcester sauce.

The value of sales of chilli sauces increased to £19.2million in the year up to June – a rise of nine per cent on the previous 12 months, according to data from market analysts Kantar Worldpanel.

Over the same period, sales of Worcester sauce – which is made from ingredients including anchovies, tamarind, garlic, soy sauce, sugar and vinegar – fell by 3.3 per cent to £17.6million.

A report in The Grocer magazine said that the value of sales of sauces and condiments has surged by 4.9 per cent over the past year while volumes are up by 3.4 per cent.

‘Chilli and hot pepper sauces have become familiar additions to the picnic table,’ it said. ‘Over the past 12 months alone, [the] value [of] sales of such sauces have soared 9 per cent. 

'Some of the more traditional sauce and condiment categories and brands are struggling… a sign of how dramatically British palates are changing.

‘Britons’ growing appetite for fiery sauces is not new but experts suggest the trend is accelerating as consumers become increasingly adventurous in the kitchen.’
