Stuart Adams, 30, and daughter Lana-Mai, were reported missing to the police by the baby's mother at 2.20am

Police have found a nine-week-old baby and arrested her father after the pair went missing early this morning.

Stuart Adams, 30, and daughter Lana-Mai, were reported missing at 2.20am, sparking an urgent manhunt.

He had been drinking when he arrived at the family home in Walsall, before leaving with the baby after an argument, Lana-Mai's mother said.

After hours of searching, officers found the pair at a nearby house, and arrested Adams - who tried to run.

Lana-Mai has been taken to hospital to be checked over.

Chief Supt Dave Sturman, Commander of Walsall, said: 'We would like to thank the people of Walsall and beyond for their help in this fast moving enquiry.

'I am relieved and pleased to be able to say that Lana-Mai is safe and well.

'Thank you to everyone who helped share our appeal.'

Lana-Mai's mother called police in a state of concern shortly after 2am.

She said Adams took some formula and bottles but few other essential items, police said in an appeal for information.

She told officers her daughter was wearing a pink babygrow with press-studs down the front with a ballerina design.

She was wrapped in a peach and cream colour blanket.

Stuart Adams, who has been arrested on suspicion of assault, is 5ft 7in tall with dark hair and last seen wearing blue jeans, blue jacket, white t-shirt and white trainers.

Police launched an appeal urging people to come forward with any information or may have seen anything this morning near the house in Pleck in Walsall.

A West Midlands police spokesman said:
 'Officers searching for a father and his nine-week-old have this 
afternoon found a baby safe and well.

'The child has been taken to hospital as a precaution to be checked over.

'Moments ago, a man in Walsall was arrested.'

Lana-Mai turned nine weeks old yesterday and was wearing a pink babygrow with press-studs down the front with a ballerina design

The pair were found nearby in Walsall 'safe and well'. Police said a man was arrested and baby taken to hospital

Earlier, Walsall Police chief inspector 
Sue Parker said: 'We are incredibly concerned for Lana-Mai's welfare as 
she is so young and we understand her departure from the family home was
 not planned.

'We know that Stuart had been drinking earlier in the night and that also gives us cause for concern.

'We urge anyone who knows of their whereabouts to contact us as soon as possible so we can reunite Lana-Mai with her concerned mother and make sure that she is safe and well.

Earlier, Chief Superintendent Dave Sturman, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Officers attended a domestic incident at 2.20am. There had been a bit of an argument.

'Stuart has taken his daughter in unplanned circumstances. We don't believe there is an immediate threat to the child.

'We urge dad to get in touch with us. Mum is really concerned.'
