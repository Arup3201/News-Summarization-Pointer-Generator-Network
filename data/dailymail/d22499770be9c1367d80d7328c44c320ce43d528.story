FIFA has rejected an appeal by Luis Suarez and the Uruguay Football Federation (AUF) against his four-month ban from all football activities for biting an opponent.

The appeal was lodged against the sanctions imposed on the Liverpool striker by FIFA's disciplinary committee for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini.

They included a nine-match international ban plus a 100,000 Swiss franc (Â£66,000) fine.

VIDEO Suarez appeal rejected

FIFA head of media Delia Fischer told a 
news conference in Rio de Janeiro: 'The FIFA appeal committee has 
decided to reject the appeals lodged by both the Uruguayan player Luis 
Suarez and the Uruguayan FA, and to confirm the decision rendered by the
 FIFA disciplinary committee on June 25 2014 in its entirety.

'The terms of the decision taken by the FIFA appeal committee were communicated to the player and the Uruguayan FA today (Thursday).'

Both the player and the AUF can make a further appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Fischer
 added: 'The relevant decision is not yet final and binding, i.e. an 
appeal to the Court of Arbitration of Sport is still possible by the 
player and/or the Uruguayan FA, subject to certain conditions.'

The 
disciplinary committee's initial decision took into account there had 
been no remorse from Suarez, and the fact it was the third time he had 
been involved in biting an opponent.

After lodging his appeal, Suarez did then issue a formal apology to Chiellini and vowed never to bite anyone again.

The
 player was sent home from the World Cup in disgrace and faces being out
 of club football until the end of October, during which time he will 
not be allowed to train with a club.

FIFA has confirmed that the ban 
will not stand in the way of any transfer to Barcelona, who are close to
 agreeing a deal with Liverpool, nor of Suarez having a medical at a 
prospective new club.
