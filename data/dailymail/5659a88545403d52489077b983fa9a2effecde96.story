Zlatan Ibrahimovic has extra motivation to hit the ground running as Laurent Blanc's Paris Saint-Germain prepare for their friendly against Inter Milan in Morocco on Tuesday.

The 33-year-old Ibrahimovic has scored 12 goals already this season and will want to show that a three-week winter break has not frozen his scoring form when he faces his former side.

The Ligue 1 champions are holding a training camp in Marrakech as they look to make sure the team retains match fitness.

Blanc won Ligue 1 with PSG last season, but his team are currently third in the table this year

And Ibrahimovic looked focused on making sure his form continues into the second half of the season. 

PSG are currently third in Ligue 1, a point behind Lyon in second and three behind leaders Marseille and will need the enigmatic Ibrahimovic fit and firing if they are to overturn the difference.

Inter coach Roberto Mancini, whose side is languishing in 11th in Serie A, believes the game will provide an enticing encounter as PSG have an array of players who used to ply their trade in Serie A.

Speaking to Inter's club channel, Mancini said: 'There are Italians at PSG, as well as  Ibrah­imovic and Maxwell.
