Diego Costa will almost certainly miss Chelsea's title showdown with Manchester City on Saturday after being charged with violent conduct for his stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can.

Costa's case is being fast-tracked by the FA and he is expected to be banned for three games following the incident in Tuesday's ill-tempered Capital One Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge.

The Chelsea forward, who has escaped punishment for a separate altercation with Martin Skrtel, has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to the charge.

The FA's disciplinary commission, which consists of a QC plus a former manager and a member of the FA council, will deliver its judgement on Friday.

Even though Costa is entitled to provide a written submission and deny the charge, he has no right of appeal if he is found guilty, which is likely considering the video footage of the incident.

It means Chelsea are braced for an immediate three-match ban that will include the clash with City at Stamford Bridge, along with the following Premier League games against Aston Villa and Everton.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho maintained that the fiery forward, who has scored 17 times since his move from Atletico Madrid, was innocent after their 1-0 victory over Liverpool.

The FA asked referee Michael Oliver if he had seen the 12th-minute incident between Costa and Can before reviewing video footage of the clash that took place in front of Chelsea's technical area.

Despite Chelsea's healthy five-point lead over Manuel Pellegrini's side, the loss of Costa will still be felt by the league leaders.

On Wednesday night his Chelsea team-mate Eden Hazard defended the forward's bruising approach to the game and claimed Costa has the right attitude.

Hazard said: 'When you play with this guy you have to give everything.

'You can see in every action, every ball, he gives his life. Even if he didn't score he gave his life.

'Every team and every player knows him now. He got a yellow card, but we need him because he can score in every minute, or every second.

'In training he a little bit different. He never stops and had a good mentality against Liverpool.'

Brendan Rodgers was openly critical of Costa's approach to the game after Chelsea advanced to their first final since Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge last summer.

Although the Liverpool manager stopped short of criticising the officials, he did claim that Costa should have been sent off.

The FA charge means Mourinho will have to turn to Didier Drogba or Loic Remy to play up front as Chelsea attempt to extend their lead over their nearest challengers.

Chelsea are also sweating on the fitness of midfielder Cesc Fabregas after he reported for treatment at the club's training centre on Wednesday.

Fabregas suffered a hamstring injury in the first half when he was challenged by Lucas Leiva and finally succumbed when he collided with captain John Terry shortly after the break.

Fabregas had intensive treatment on the injury on Wednesday and Mourinho will assess the Chelsea midfielder again on Thursday.

Chelsea's manager has escaped punishment from the FA after his tunnel confrontation with Oliver as the teams walked down the tunnel at half-time.

Mourinho rightly believed that his team should have been awarded a penalty when Skrtel clipped Costa in the Liverpool penalty area in the first half. Radio Five Live analyst Danny Mills repeatedly called Oliver a 'bottler' on air.

On Wednesday the FA, who have fined Mourinho £25,000 for claiming there is a 'campaign' against Chelsea, confirmed they will take no further action against the Portuguese coach.

There was another outburst from Mourinho after the extra-time victory over Liverpool as he accused Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp of having a vendetta.

Sky Sports analysts Thierry Henry and Redknapp both agreed that Costa should have been sent off for the incident with Can.

Mourinho said: 'I don't know what you understand by a stamp. Maybe you are already influenced by the campaign on television with certain pundits saying that Costa has committed a crime - the guy who says that must be nuts.

'Sky calls it a crime, but he goes to the ball, he chases it, the opponent goes to the floor and he puts his foot there when he is looking at the ball.

'It is a great campaign. We know how much that pundit loves Chelsea. So he is sitting there, you are very well paid and you are a manager putting their ass on the bench and these guys have a good seat, earning a lot of money, no pressure.

'They are never wrong, they have to be fair and they have to be honest.'

Costa was also involved in another altercation with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, but the case is closed because Oliver booked the pair.

The Chelsea striker appeared to grab Gerrard around the chest and the Liverpool captain responded by putting his head into the face of Costa.

Although there were a number of other volatile incidents, the FA are only looking at one more incident.

Skrtel is alleged to have made hand gestures towards Chelsea supporters at the final whistle, but the FA cannot rely on still images to charge him with misconduct.

Instead they are scouring video footage in an attempt to clear up the matter as part of the FA's fast-track scheme.

Oliver will escape censure from the PGMOL after his bizarre handshake with Chelsea goalscorer Branislav Ivanovic when the defender was booked for tugging Raheem Sterling's shirt.
