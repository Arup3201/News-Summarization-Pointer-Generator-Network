Britain's oldest prison which was once home to notorious criminals including the Kray twins has shut after more than 400 years.

Shepton Mallet Prison in Somerset - officially known as HMP Cornhill - has been home to thousands of convicts since opening its doors in 1610.

The 189 inmates, who included murderers and sex offenders, at the Category C lifer, Grade II-listed prison were transferred to other jails around the country ahead of yesterday's closure.

Saddened: Governor Andy Rogers said Shepton Mallet had been 'part of the community since 1610'

In the 1950s, the prison became home to 
London's feared East End gangsters Ron and Reggie Kray, who were serving sentences for assaulting a police officer while AWOL from the National service.

Slammed shut: The prison housed 189 inmates

During their stay the twins met 
future rivals Charlie Richardson and George Cornell, who Ron later shot 
dead in The Blind Beggar pub in London's Whitechapel.

It is one of seven in England and 
Wales to be closed by the Ministry of Justice, which is considering 
building a super prisons for around 2,000 convicted criminals to save Â£63million a year.

Authorities are still to decided what
to do with the building with plans ranging from a holding centre for 
illegal immigrants awaiting deportation to a commercial development such
as a supermarket.

The closure is viewed with sadness by the local community, many of whom worked at the prison at some point during their lives.

Of the 118 staff employed there when it shut, 30 have taken voluntary redundancy, 20 are moving to Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire and 70 will be moved to other facilities.

Governor Andy Rogers said: 'I am 
obviously saddened because a lot of staff have a history of working on 
the site and it has been part of the community since 1610.

'But I understand that things move on. There are better places for offenders to be relocated that are more economic.'

End of an era: The prison has housed thousands of convicted criminals since it first opened in 1610

Cost-cutting: HMP Cornhill is one of seven in England and Wales to be closed by the Ministry of Justice

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson 
added: 'We are determined to drive down the cost of running our prisons,
this is why we are replacing older accommodation that is expensive to 
run with newer, cheaper and more efficient accommodation that will 
provide better value for money.'

More than 200 prison staff - past and
present - joined the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Rt Rev Peter Price 
for a closing ceremony at the prison yesterday.

Staff who still had the full dress uniform were asked to wear it for the service, complete with hats and medals. The longest serving prison officer, Clive Vincent, presented the colours to governor Andy Rogers during the ceremony.

Also present was Francis Disney, 82, a prison historian who worked as an officer at Shepton Mallet for 15 years.

He told MailOnline: 'The walls are as solid as every and its is a real shame it's closing. It was very upsetting for the town.'

Bloody past: The prison's execution room, which was turned into a library in 1997

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, the prison was used by the British military.

The
War Cabinet sent some of the country's most important historical 
documents there in case of invasion, including the Magna Carta and 
Domesday Book.

Nelson's logbook from the HMS Victory and dispatches from the Battle of Waterloo were also stored there, along with the agreement singed at the 1938 Munich Conference by Neville Chamblerain and Hitler.

Later in the war, the U.S. military used Shepton Mallet, including for the execution of 18 servicemen - nine of whom were convicted or murder, six of rape and three of both.

This harked back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the jail hosted judicial executions.

A
parliamentary inspection report from 1773 highlighted the squalid 
conditions there, painting a picture of an overcrowded, disease-ridden 
prison.

It closed in 1930 because of under use, with only 51 convicted criminals serving sentences there.

Shepton
Mallet returned to civilian use in 1996 and a year later the execution 
block was turned into the prison library. It became a Category C prison 
in 1991.
