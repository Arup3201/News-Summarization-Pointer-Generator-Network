America has its first all-vegan elementary school thanks to James Cameron's wife Suzy Amis.

The Avatar director and his wife founded MUSE School in Calabasas, California, and Suzy announced last week their students will no longer eat, nor will the school utilize, any meat products, reports the Hollywood Reporter.

'Meals that are served at Muse will be 100 percent plant-based. The average person would say vegan, but we say whole food, plant-based. It's about raising kids who don't think it's strange or exotic or worthy of a pat on the back to be doing the right thing for the living biosphere.'

Earthy: America has its first all-vegan elementary school thanks to James Cameron's wife Suzy Amis.

The non-traditional private school is nestled in nature in the hills of Southern California and claims, per their website, to 'give each a voice in choosing curriculum based on what they like, how they learn, where they find fun, and what they need.'

Amis, Cameron's fifth wife, made the announcement at LA's Chateau Marmont for an event where she was introducing a line of dresses whose sales will benefit the environmentally focused school.

The celebrity standard-bearers for a vegan lifestyle aren't just wispy young actresses. They include talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres, along with wife Portia de Rossi. (Or Oprah Winfrey, who isn't vegan but led her staff on a public 21-day vegan cleanse.) 

Starting in the fall, Amis announced last week that 'meals that are served at Muse will be 100 percent plant-based. The average person would say vegan, but we say whole food, plant-based'

Or men like Ozzy Osbourne and Russell Brand, who in recent weeks both declared themselves vegans. Athletes like Carl Lewis and Mike Tyson. Even NFL player Tony Gonzalez, tight end for the Atlanta Falcons and 245-plus pounds — attributes his longevity to a largely vegan diet.

And then there are the moguls, like billionaire publisher, real estate developer and recent avowed vegan Mort Zuckerman, and Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino magnate, who's hired a vegan chef and put vegan options in all his resort restaurants. Biz Stone, the co-founder of Twitter, also has spoken of his veganism.

Of all the high-profile vegans, though, Bill Clinton is the biggest 'catch.' Advocates were thrilled and stunned when he talked about it on CNN, telling Wolf Blitzer that his impressive, 24-pound weight loss was due to a largely plant-based diet — a regime he believes will prolong his life.
