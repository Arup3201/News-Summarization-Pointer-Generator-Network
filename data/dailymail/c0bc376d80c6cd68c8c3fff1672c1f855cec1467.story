The 'uncle' of a 10-year-old girl found dead in a Maryland field on Monday has been arrested.

Richard Madden Jr., 29, who lives at the home where Kami Ring was staying before her death, was charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine on Tuesday night.

Police said a 'person of interest' is in custody in connection with the little girl's murder, however they have not identified that person and no charges have yet been filed relating to Kami's death.

Madden, who has a string of past arrests, was charged after officers found the substances during a search of the Port Deposit home he shared with his parents - two people Kami had for years considered her grandparents though they were not related to her.

All three people living in the home have
been questioned regarding Kami's death, the cause and manner of which 
are still under investigation.

Madden, whose most recent job was at Denny's restaurant in Perryville, is being held on a retake warrant related to conditions tied to his 2012 parole, according to ABC News. According to court records, Madden 
pleaded guilty to theft in 2009 and was sentenced to five years' jail 
but was released last fall.

He remains in the Cecil County Detention Center in lieu of $10,000 bond. Police have not released a mug shot of Madden.

According to the Cecil Daily, court records do not directly describe Madden as the 'person of interest' but a passage in the charging document reads: 'A resident of that location, Richard Eugene Madden, Jr., was of the last known persons to see the victim.'

Kami, who lived in Charlestown, Maryland, with her mother, stepfather and two younger siblings, was staying at her so-called grandparents' home for the weekend. No other family members were with her.

Last night, her devastated stepfather called the little girl's death 'an inside job.'

'With all the information that I've gotten it has to be an inside job,' Ricky Dean told WBAL-TV. 'We have taught her to scream at the top of her lungs if something ever happened.'

He added that Kami was a straight-A 
student at Charlestown Elementary School. 'She was a model 10-year old. 
The best kid you could ever have,' he said.

Brittany Dotson, who got to know Kami at Cecil County Girls and Boys club where she attended afterschool care each afternoon, broke down as she described the 10-year-old who loved to laugh, sing and dance.

She added that Kami was fiercely protective of her half-brother, Joe, a third-grader, and half-sister, Lizzy, a second-grader.

'She was one of a kind,' Dotson said. 'She was the sweetest. Her brother and sister were everything to her. She was amazing in every way. I just don't understand.'

The shocking discovery of the little girl's body on Monday rocked the Port Deposit community. 

Kami disappeared from her bedroom in the middle of the night and her grandparents reported her missing at around 11 a.m. on Monday. After a seven-hour search, her lifeless body was discovered in a field near a shed just 60 yards in front of their home.

The little girl was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mystery surrounds what happened to her on Sunday night. The family members say she was last seen around 10 p.m. when she went to bed.

According to WBAL a window of the bedroom where she was staying was about 7-inches open and the screen had been pushed out.

'They went to check on her and she was missing,' Maryland State Police Sgt. Bill McFarland told Cecil Daily.

Police set up a command center with the Cecil County Department of Emergency Services at the nearby Pleasant View Baptist Church and conducted an exhaustive search of the area near the home, Cecil Daily reported. State Troopers, Maryland Police search dogs and Chesapeake Search and Rescue were involved in the investigation.

Investigators found her body at 6:20 p.m. on Monday.

State police said they were also pursuing other leads.

McFarland said police have interviewed Ring's mother, but her father doesn't live in the area.

'He is out of the picture,' McFarland said.

ABC2 reported she had two siblings but they weren't staying at the property.

Her stepfather Rick Dean, told the broadcaster: 'Kami's a model 10-year-old. She was staying somewhere she felt safe.'

Tributes flooded in for the Charlestown Elementary School student on various social networking sites and members of the local community expressed their sadness and shock at the discovery of her body.

A candlelight vigil was held for her in the town on Tuesday night.

Her body was taken to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore for an autopsy.

Another girl reported missing from the Port Deposit are was found safe in a separate incident, according to the Cecil Daily.

A 12-year-old ran away from home Monday afternoon but was found 90 minutes after her family reported her missing.
