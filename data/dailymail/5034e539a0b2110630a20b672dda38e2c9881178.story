A Chinese police officer has escaped disciplinary action after losing control of a van and leaving it suspended three storeys above a street.

The driver of the van, Park He, 35, was heading back to the police station, in Weihai City in Shandong Province, in the east of China,  following a police operation at the time of the incident.

He made a left turn after spotting another vehicle was on the wrong side of the road, his supervisors have said.

A police spokesman said the driver 'risked his own life in order to save somebody else' and will not face disciplinary action.

The spokesman said: 'He could have gone left or right and he chose to go left which was a bad decision, as that was the roof of the residential building which was three stories above the street below.

'Had he gone to the right the ending would not have been quite so spectacular.

'However there will be no action taken against the police driver, who at the end of the day risked his own life in order to save somebody else.

The vehicle was initially lifted to safety using a crane operator after being secured in place with ropes to stop it falling further into the street below

'Everybody makes mistakes, although he may well need a refresher course in driving before we give him another van.'

The police spokesman added: 'It was wedged pretty tightly and there was also some debris that fell into the street below that needed to be cleared up, fortunately nobody was hurt seriously so everything was right in the end.'
