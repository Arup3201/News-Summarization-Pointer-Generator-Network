A woman who tried to smuggle almost £3million-worth of fake toothbrushes and razor blades has been sentenced to 15 months in prison.

Jocelyn Hunter was caught trying to illegally import the Oral B toothbrushes and Gillette Fusion razor blades in a complex scam which took place over the course of a year.

The 42-year-old from Swindon, Wiltshere, bought the bathroom products - which had not been tested for cancer-causing chemicals - from dodgy suppliers in China.

Hunter then flogged the items  which had an estimated 'street value' of £2.7million to customers in mainland Europe.

She believed it would be easier to get the illegal goods into the continent through Britain's 'lax' border security.

Her operation was discovered when customs officers seized the goods at the Coventry Postal Hub and informed the brand holder, Proctor and Gamble.

At the time of her arrest, a large box of counterfeit Oral B toothbrush heads was found in her living room.

The large-scale scame lasted between May 2 and June 30, 2011 - during which time she received 248 parcels from China.

John Jacobs, from Scambusters South West, said: 'The sentence reflects the seriousness of the offences Hunter has been convicted of and this case demonstrates the varied and widespread nature of counterfeiting activity.

'It is far from a victimless crime, not only are they of a significantly inferior quality they are often produced by workers barely able to survive on the wages received.'

Lord Toby Harris, Chair of National Trading Standards, said: 'It is great news that this criminal has been brought to justice and I commend all parties involved.

'People are often lured in by the promise of a bargain but many counterfeit products, while they may look like the real thing, can be very low quality and in some cases unsafe.

'I would urge people to help National Trading Standards to catch these criminals by remaining vigilant and reporting any products they think may be counterfeit to their local trading standards office or Citizens Advice.'
