An Irishman convicted of trying to buy weapons and explosives for the Real IRA has been cleared by a court in Lithuania.

Michael Campbell, 41, was arrested in 2008 after a MI5 sting 
operation as he allegedly tried to purchase deadly equipment from arms dealers on behalf of the dissident group , who were suspected of carrying out the Omagh bombings.

But the Vilnius Appeals Court said there was not enough evidence linking him to the terrorist group.

He smiled as police removed his 
handcuffs and said: 'I am very happy. I will go to Ireland as soon as possible.'

Two years ago, a Lithuanian court found him guilty in a case which drew attention to the splinter group's plans to target London.

Video footage and intercepted communications
showed Campbell had allegedly paid about more than Â£5,000 for high-grade
explosives, grenade launchers, detonators, AK-47s and a special 
assassin's rifle to Lithuanian agents posing as arms dealers.

In
an audio recording, Campbell was also heard discussing how easy it would be 
with the type of equipment on offer to plant a bomb in London and 
escape.

He was given prison sentences of five years for weapons possession, six years for attempting to smuggle weapons and explosives, and 12 years for supporting a terrorist group.

However,
the judge at that trial said the sentences on the weapons charges would
be canceled since no harm was caused and that Campbell did not have 
prior convictions for similar offenses.

At the appeals hearing, Judge Viktoras Kazys said: 'There
was no direct evidence proving Campbell's ties with Real IRA. He was 
never arrested by British or Irish authorities for terrorism-linked 
activities.

'The prosecution did not provide enough 
evidence to deny statements that Campbell's actions were provoked by 
undercover MI5 agents.'

Michael Campbell's lawyer, Ingrida Botyriene, escorted Campbell to the Irish Embassy after his release.

She said: 'A person cannot be sentenced for a crime committed by state officials.

'We will be discussing possibilities to demand compensation for my client.'

The freed prisoner, from Dundalk in 
Co Louth, is a younger brother of the alleged founder of the dissident 
republican RIRA, Liam Campbell.

Liam has never faced criminal charges for his part in the Omagh blast but was held responsible by a civil court.

It was not immediately clear if prosecutors can appeal Wednesday's decision by the appeals court.
