A graphic designer has combined a printer with a blowtorch to make an incredible tool which burns images onto surfaces down to the tiniest detail.

The 'FireWriter' was created by Lucien Langton to reproduce black and white images perfectly pixel for pixel on walls, wood, plastic and fabric.

The blowtorch is mounted on rollers, and the user simply loads the image they want into a computer, the 'rolls' the contraption along a large sheet of wood.

Lucien Langton built the FireWriter which burns images pixel for pixel onto surfaces without setting them on fire

The FireWriter combines an inkjet printer with a blowtorch to burn images onto surfaces

Butane and propane are burned at 1,200C to create black and white images pixel for pixel

The tool, invented at ECAL, the University of Art and Design Lausanne, burns a mixture of butane and propane at 1,200C to create the images but does not set surfaces on fire.

An Arduino Uno, a small self-contained 
computer, was programmed with wiring and processing to integrate an 
inkjet printer, a Dremel torch, and a calibration module with an optical
sensor.

A user holds the FireWriter up against 
the surface they want to print on, and then guides it horizontally along using calibrated wheels.

Mr Langton said: 'FireWriter is a machine using 
contemporary rapid prototyping electronics combined with humanityâ€™s 
first technology: fire,' he said.

The machine was constructed by Lucien Langton at ECAL, the University of Art and Design Lausanne

Wheels enable the user to lower the printer one line at a time on the vertical axis using a support

Lucien Langton said he wanted to combine the oldest technology known to man with more modern tehnology

'The purpose is to propose a dialogue between 
image reproduction and its destruction.'

The FireWriter works by feeding an image into the processing script, which writes a wiring code that can be compiled and sent onto the Arduino board.

It has wheels that enable the user to lower the printer one line at a time
on the vertical axis on a support.

The duration, strength and precision of the flame can be controlled in real-time manually with a pitch.
