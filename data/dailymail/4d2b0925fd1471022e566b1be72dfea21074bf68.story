Real Madrid defender Pepe got over the disappointment of being an unused substitute in Tuesday's 1-0 win over Liverpool with some retail therapy alongside his wife Ana Sofia Moreira.

The couple were spotted shopping in Madrid on Wednesday, with Pepe's garishly colourful jumper not doing much to help him blend in with the general public.

The jumper will probably not become as iconic as the white shirt of Madrid which he regularly wears on the pitch.

The Portugal international was left on the bench by manager Carlo Ancelotti as Madrid secured their route to the knockout stages of the Champions League with victory over a weakened Liverpool team selected in controversial circumstances by Brendan Rodgers.

The defender will hope to return to the starting line-up for Saturday's clash against Rayo Vallecano, where victory would be enough to see Madrid remain top of La Liga.

Pepe should then join up with the Portugal squad before travelling to Manchester for a mouth-watering friendly at Old Trafford on November 18 against Argentina, where Cristiano Ronaldo will return to Old Trafford to take on Lionel Messi's World Cup runners-up.
