Her life had descended into chaos, 
with heroin addiction leading to spells in jail, ravaging her looks and
leaving her loving family in despair.

But after more than a decade, Jeanette Fidler finally kicked the destructive habit and is clearly showing the benefits.

Gone is the mother of two’s haunted, 
gaunt and prematurely aged face. She looks glamorous and younger than 
her 40 years, with a beaming, confident smile and a cascade of brunette 
hair.

The transformation came after she 
stayed clean for ten months and underwent an eight-week treatment 
programme while in jail awaiting sentence on theft charges.

Fidler stole tens of thousands of 
pounds worth of valuables from lockers at gyms and hotel health clubs in
northern England to buy drugs after losing her job as a recruitment 
manager.

She conned staff into handing over keys or broke in to steal cash, credit cards, mobile phones and jewellery.

Yesterday she narrowly avoided jail when a judge showed mercy despite her admission of 12 thefts and 174 previous convictions.

Judge Bernard Lever heard that she has
stopped taking heroin, completed the drug rehabilitation programme and plans to train as a beauty therapist.

‘You have committed more of these 
offences than I’ve had hot dinners,’ he said. ‘You have been a 
one-person crimewave going round these leisure centres and rifling 
people’s property.

‘Why on earth should people have to 
put up with this? My natural inclination would be to jail you for a very
long time, but you have been on this new programme and are determined 
to address your drug use.

‘I am going to give you the chance to demonstrate that you are committed to turning your life around.’

The judge did, however, ban her from 
every gym and health club in Britain for four years as part of an Anti 
Social Behaviour Order.

He warned that if she breaks this ban ‘there will be a four-year jail sentence waiting for you’.

Fidler, of Oldham, was also sentenced 
to a two-year community order with supervision. She appeared in court 
after being caught red-handed raiding a locker at the Village Gym, in 
Hyde, Greater Manchester, in June.

Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said: ‘[A 
woman] saw a locker open with the defendant on her hands and knees. The 
defendant became annoyed and said, “Are you accusing me” and the witness
had the courage to say, “Yes”.’

Fidler, who has two teenage sons, was 
chased out of the gym and escaped in a hire car with four mobile phones 
worth £1,900, plus £285 in cash and a debit card.

Two days earlier, she had crept into 
the female changing rooms at The Waterside Hotel and Leisure Centre in 
Didsbury, Greater  Manchester, breaking into five lockers and stealing 
£210 in cash.

Fidler committed the offences after being released early on licence from a previous jail term for theft.

In 2011, she had been imprisoned for 
two years after pleading guilty to stealing £16,000 worth of goods from 
lockers, including one victim’s wedding and engagement rings.

In 2002, 
she was jailed for three-and-a-half years after admitting 32 offences of
theft or deception. Another 184 offences were taken into consideration.

Minshull Street Crown Court, 
Manchester, heard that her problems began in 2000 when she lost her job 
as a recruitment manager and became hooked on heroin.

To pay off drug debts, she began 
stealing from the customers of gyms and swimming baths, taking their 
wallets, keys and valuables when they were distracted or having a 
shower.

On other occasions, she tricked staff into opening lockers by pretending a friend had left with the key or that she had lost it.

Fidler sold the property or used cheques or credit cards to go on spending sprees.

Her care officer Francine  McKeown 
said: ‘Her drug use is related to issues with self-confidence and 
self-esteem. She is from a very good family and although they support 
her, they are extremely disappointed.

‘Her mother and father, through the years, have decided that they can be involved.

‘She began to discuss these issues in 
depth to analyse the harm she’s caused her family, including her sons. 
She has completed the programme. In the future, she looks to become a 
recovery mentor.’
