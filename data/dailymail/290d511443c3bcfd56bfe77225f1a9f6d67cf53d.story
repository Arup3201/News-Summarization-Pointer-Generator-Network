A murder investigation has been launched after a teenager who was shot in the eye over an apparent dispute about a girl died in hospital from his injuries.

The 18-year-old man, who has not yet been named by police, was taken to hospital after being shot in Rotherhithe, south east London, on Sunday afternoon.

Police said he died from his injuries just before 4.45pm yesterday and confirmed two men had been arrested in connection with his death. The incident is not believed to be gang-related.

Police said investigations remain ongoing at the scene and confirmed a murder probe had been launched

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A 36-year-old man was arrested at an address in south London in the early hours of Monday.

'A 21-year-old man was arrested after he handed himself in at a south London police station. Both men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and remain in custody.'

A 19-year-old man injured in the same incident has now been released from hospital following treatment. He was allegedly beaten with a medieval-style mace in the attack.

Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Gwyn, of the Met's homicide and major crime command based at Lewisham, said: 'We are retaining an open mind as to the motive behind this incident, but there is nothing to suggest at this stage that it was gang-related.

'A crime scene remains in place at the scene.'

Earlier, witnesses told how they saw the shot teenager writhing in agony after being hit in the eye in the 'dispute over a girl.'

He was initially knocked unconscious by the shot before coming around as residents went to his aid.

Officers could be seen combing the spot for evidence yesterday as it emerged the victim had died in hospital

Nigel Fletcher, 46, described seeing the victim lying in a pool of blood wearing trainers, jeans and black coat.

He said: 'I looked out and saw the guy lying on the floor in a pool of blood.

'The others obviously fled as quick as they could.

'He was just lying there still as a bat - he wasn't moving at all. I just assumed he was dead, dead instantly. There was blood everywhere.

'I heard the shooting, it sounded like two shots. There was a big bang, like a firework, but it was obviously a gun. It echoed around the estate.

'My missus came down and just said "someone's been shot". She told me she's heard arguing outside and then heard the shots and saw one or two of them running away.

'I've never seen anything like it. Things like this don't happen around here.'

A 19-year-old man was also allegedly attacked with a medieval-style mace in the broad daylight attack

The road and footpath remained shut to the public yesterday as police investigations continued at the scene

Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'I looked out of my window because I heard a noise.

'A blue car sped away and there was a lot of shouting. One group ran one way and others ran through the car park.

'I didn't realise someone had been shot. I only realised when my neighbour said. I called for an ambulance and went down with a towel.

'He was white and I did see he had an injury to his eye. He was huddled over. He was alive but he was groaning. He was conscious.

'It all happened so quickly. I have lived here for two-and-a-half years and never seen anything like this before.'
