Britain is facing a severe drought this summer after the driest winter on record, experts have warned.

Without heavy rainfall in the immediate 
future, extreme water shortages could hit many parts of the country - causing parched landscapes, rivers drying up and hosepipe bans in 
the summer.

Such conditions would have a huge knock-on effect for farmers, food production, tourism and local wildlife.

Warning: Low levels in Ogston Reservoir in Derbyshire last year. 
2011 was the driest year in England Wales for 90 years and the environment agency has warned that without rain in the near future, England will 
experience a severe droughtÂ 

Officials from the Environment Agency
say the worst affected areas would include the Midlands, East Anglia 
and the south-east of England - and underground supplies are already 
being used to keep the rivers flowing.

The impending crisis has been building
for the past 18 months - reservoirs were already low at the beginning 
of last year, and 2011 was the driest year in England and Wales for 90 
years.

Rivers have 
already dried up in several areas - and agency workers have been forced 
to rescue fish stranded in pools, moving them to areas where water is 
flowing.

Ian Baker, 
head of water, land and biodiversity at the Agency, said: 'Across the 
Midlands, East Anglia and the South East we have had exceptionally low 
rainfall over the last five months, following on from a dry Spring in 
2011.

'In
East Anglia, soils are still very dry so they are not soaking up the 
rainfall. Ground water levels are very low and most of the rivers rely 
on ground water to keep them flowing.

Dried up: The River Kennet in Wiltshire was reduced to a trickle in December after months of low rainfall

'The
last five months in East Anglia have been the driest period since 
records began in 1910 - that means some ground water levels are also at 
record low levels.

'It is likely we will still see very low ground water levels even if it rains and that will impact on farmers, the

environment, wildlife and public water supplies.

At the RSPB reserve in Titchwell Marsh, 
Norfolk, springs have dried up leaving birds such as this bearded tit 
struggling to find food

'Once you get past April, the plants start growing and start taking up the water as well. The next few months are critical in terms of refilling ground water.

'We are looking at different rainfall scenarios in terms of how much we will get and we are using that to advice farmers to think about the crops they are planting. We are also ensuring water companies are doing all they can to preserve resources.

'It is a case of them engaging with customers to explain the situation and encourage them to use water carefully. A lot of people do not make the connection between water coming out of their taps and the nearby river.

'We are making sure we have specialist equipment ready to carry out fish rescues - we have already seen some ponds and streams drying up and we have had to rescue the fish. '

At the RSPB reserve in Titchwell Marsh, Norfolk, springs have dried up and many of the birds, including populations of bearded tits, marsh harriers and reed warblers, are struggling to find food.

Mr Baker said: 'The birds will struggle to find food and that will impact on their ability to breed in the Spring and survive - the same happens with fish.'

He went on: 'Over the next two to three months, across East Anglia and the South East, it needs to rain more than average and it must be steady to put us in a healthier position. By April, we will have a feel for how difficult the summer will be.'

Otherwise, he said, more fish will be killed and 'farmers will struggle to have enough water to irrigate their crops; yields of potatoes, other vegetables and salad crops will be impacted.'He added: 'It is certainly something to worry about.'
