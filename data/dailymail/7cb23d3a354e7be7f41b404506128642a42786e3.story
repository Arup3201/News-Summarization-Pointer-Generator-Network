These stunning works of art are set to blow people away after a sculptor painstakingly cut shapes out of fallen leaves.

Lorenzo Duran Silva, 43, was inspired to create the delicate work after watching a caterpillar make holes in a leaf by eating it.

He collects foliage in his garden and parks which he then spends weeks transforming into beautiful works of art.

Mr Silva, from Guadalajara, near Madrid, washes, dries and presses the leaves before sketching out complicated patterns to apply to each one. Above, a piece commissioned for a friend

Each piece can take between a week and two months to complete as a slight slip of the hand could rip the surface and destroy hours of work

The talented artist then carefully follows his designs and uses a knife to intricately slice through the paper and leaf below.

He has created stunning wildlife scenes including a bird and insects, complex geometric shapes and even a skull.

A spooky half-skull design... just in time for Halloween

Lorenzo's art work ranges in price depending on the species of leaf and the complexity of the design but they have fetched up to £2,400

Mr Silva, a father-of-one from Guadalajara, near Madrid, said: 'I was inspired by a caterpillar and how it was eating a leaf and I thought, "What if I try to cut out drawings on a leaf?".

'Afterwards I studied different techniques for cutting paper which helped me to develop my current work.

'I start by picking the leaves, washing, drying, pressing and cutting - and while they are in the press, I sketch out the drawing, which I attach to the leaf before starting to cut it.

'At the end, I peel it off which is the hardest part and the most delicate of all because the leaf is fragile and days of work can be ruined in just moments.

'I have been using this technique for more than four years so I have made and sold many pieces, but I have managed to preserve my first one in a frame.'
