The echo in the oil tank at Inchindown lasts a world-record 75 seconds

An oil tank in the Scottish Highlands has earned a place in the record books after producing the world's longest echo.

Lasting an incredible 75 seconds, the reverberation smashed the previous record - also set in Scotland more than 40 years ago - by more than a minute.

It was recorded by an acoustics expert in a tank measuring twice the length of a football pitch, which was 30ft wide and more than 44ft high.

The discovery was made by Professor Trevor Cox when he climbed into the tank at Inchindown, near Invergordon, and started singing and shouting.

'I was like a toddler sitting at a piano for the first time, thrashing the ivories to see what sounds would come out,' he said.

'Reluctantly, after a few minutes I stopped playing with the acoustics and started preparing for my measurements.'

For the record, the RCAHMS' archaeological investigator Allan Kilpatrick, working with Professor Cox, shot a pistol with blanks about a third of the way down the 80-year-old tank.

Standing a third of the way from the other end, Professor Cox, of Salford University, recorded the sounds with microphones.

Professor Cox said he initially felt 'disbelief' over the length of the sound.

Describing the noise, he said: 'If the world ends with an apocalyptic thunder crack, this is what it will sound like, with the rumble lingering and forlornly dying away.

'I wanted to shout with astonishment, but I had to remain silent so as not to ruin the recording.'

The 75-second reverberation puts to shame the previous world record – held by Hamilton Mausoleum, South Lanarkshire, also in Scotland – which managed 15 seconds.

The 75-second reverberation was recorded in Inchindown by Professor Trevor Cox of Salford University

The reverberation of the mausoleum chapel was caused by slamming one of the main brass doors shut in 1970.

Professor Cox wrote about his record-breaking recording in his new book, Sonic Wonderland: A Scientific Odyssey Of Sound.
