Police are thought to be close to making an arrest in the high-profile murder case of Menachem Stark but, despite the Orthodox Jewish real estate developer owing as much as $40 million debts at the time of his death, his killers could have been following up an unpaid bill of just $20,000.

According to The New York Post, investigators are focused on a contractor and several of the 40-year-old's relatives, almost three months after the discovery of his charred body in a Long Island dumpster on January 3.

Stark was abducted outside his office at 331 Rutledge St in Brooklyn about 11.35pm the night before.

The biggest development in the case since has been location of the van used in his abduction, which was caught on CCTV cameras parking on the street at 5pm on the day of his kidnapping.

Breakthrough: On January 14 police located the Dodge minivan (center) used in the kidnapping of Menachem Stark, which was carrying Ohio numberplate and is believed to have lead them to man of interest

A contractor who allegedly murdered slumlord Menachem Stark was owed $20,000 by the Brooklyn developer, it has been claimed

A suspect in the kidnap and murder of Stark is seen on security camera footage on the night of January 2. The man arrived at the scene in the minivan at 5pm and allegedly abducted Stark at 11.35pm

The same man who parked the van had been seen lurking in the area since December 19.

When Stark left his office he was confronted by two men in the snow, whom he spoke to for two minutes before being pulled into the car.

The 2002 Dodge minivan, which was carrying number plates from Ohio, was located on  January 14 in Brownsville, 10 days after Stark's murder.

Stark's DNA was found inside the van, whose owner was questioned by 90th Precinct cops at the time it was located.

The contractor at the center of the investigation is said to have a connection to the van.

Investigators also have been able to track the cellphone of one of the suspects in the area where the body was dumped, a law-enforcement source told The Post.

Complicating the case has been what sources described as Stark's long list of possible enemies, ranging from jilted business associates to tenants.

Stark's autopsy revealed he died of compression asphyxiation - which likely happened when his kidnappers sat on him during the brutal attack.

Sources believe his kidnappers probably did not intend to kill him.

His body was likely then set on fire to conceal its identity.

Detectives are telling the family that an arrest is imminent - before Passover on April 14, or immediately after the eight-day holiday, a source said.

Detectives believe that the intent of the abduction was to scare Stark into paying off his debt.

According
 to public records seen by The Post, Stark and his business 
partner, Israel Perlmutter, owed more than $40 million to creditors.

Tenants in the rental properties he owned in Brooklyn allegedly had lists of complaints about conditions.

A member of the ultra-Orthodox Satmar Hasidic sect - which separates itself from secular society and believes that Jews should not have a homeland in Israel until the arrival of the Messiah - Stark and Perlmutter began buying up properties Brooklyn in 2000.

Between 2003 and 2005 they shelled out $18 million - money raised from investors, family and friends - on 12 properties.

Between 2006 and 2008 they spent even more - $39 million on 17 properties.

Grief: Hundreds of mourners carry the coffin of Menachem Stark through the streets of Brooklyn during his funeral. Stark was a member of the ultra-Orthodox Satmar Hasidic sect, which separates itself from secular society and believes that Jews should not have a homeland in Israel until the arrival of the Messiah

In total, by 2008, they spent a staggering $61 million on 37 Brooklyn buildings, a combination of large apartment buildings and industrial properties, according to a Real Deal analysis.

But he was far from an ideal landlord, with his properties garnering 233 complaints and 148 violations, according to the city Department of Buildings, and nearly 200 Environmental Control Board violations.

By 2009 he had fallen behind a slew of mortgage payments following the market crash, owing as much as $60 million in soured loans. 

Stark and Perlmutter sold off what they could and were soon hit by nine fore­closure lawsuits on 17 of their properties. 

They filed for bankruptcy protection in six cases.

Documents also show Stark withdrew $1 million in checks in the month before he died.
