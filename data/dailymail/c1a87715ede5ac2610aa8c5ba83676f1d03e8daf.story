The drink-driver who killed a British tourist in a hit-and-run in Dubai last November has been sentenced to just two months in prison.

Gavin Duffy, 29, from Billingham, Teeside, died on the first day of his holiday visiting a friend in Dubai.

UAE prosecutors have launched an appeal to increase the sentence, which also included paying £24,400 (Dh150,000) blood money and having his driving licence suspended for six months.

Tragedy: Gavin Duffy (centre) was killed after being hit by 31-year-old Brazilian drink-driver on the first day of his Dubai holiday in November last year

The 31-year-old Brazilian was arrested
 trying to flee the country just hours after he killed Mr Duffy in the 
hit-and-run on November 23 last year.

He admitted to driving under the influence but denied responsibility of Mr Duffy’s death.

He
 was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol, causing a 
person’s death and fleeing the scene of an accident by Dubai Traffic 
Court last month, the National reports.

He
 was sentenced to two months in jail, ordered to pay Dh150,000 blood 
money and had his driving licence suspended for six months.

Mr Duffy, a quantity surveyor, hadn't bought travel insurance before going to visit friend, Craig Boyle, who had lived in Dubai for ten months.

As a result, his family embarked on a campaign to raise money to retriev his body from the UAE, and managed to raise £17,000.

Mr Duffy and Mr Boyle were crossing Al Sufouh Road in Dubai Marina at around 1.30am on November 23 when he was hit.

Witnesses
 recall how the driver did not stop after the collision but was remanded
 two hours later as he tried to flee the country at Dubai International 
Airport.

Mr Duffy's family, who originally appealed for £5,000, have said they will donate the remainder of the money raised to a hospice.
