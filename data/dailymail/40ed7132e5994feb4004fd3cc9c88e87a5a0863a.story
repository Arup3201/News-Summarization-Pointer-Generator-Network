Every now and again policemen are prepared to drop their helmets and get into the swing of things, as this gyrating bobby in Sweden shows as he dances at a gay pride event.

The policeman, dressed in his uniform, can be seen moving energetically with a man in hot-pants while party goers clad in sailor suits egg him on.

During the dance off  the man in tiny shorts does a high kick while the policeman gamely ducks underneath him. 

The Swedish officer is but one of many policemen who have been caught getting into the spirit of the events they are policing.

Last year British bobbies were filmed enjoying Notting Hill Carnival in London, which will take place next weekend.

Three officers in high vis uniforms performed a synchronised 'rowing boat' dance in front of hundreds of revellers.

Getting down with the people: Policeman in Sweden dances with revellers at gay pride event

 A video of the routine called Notting Hill Carnival 2013 Police Dance Off was posted on YouTube and received thousands of hits.

An officer called PC Armstrong posted a link to the video on Twitter with the caption: 'good community relations in my opinion'.
