A foul-mouthed parrot has been kicked out of a garden centre after customers complained she was turning the air blue with a string of rude words.

Ruby the African Grey was put on display at the Norcutts Garden Centre in Ashton, Greater Manchester - but came under fire for her non-stop swearing, which staff say is getting much worse.

They have had to remove Ruby from the shop floor for fears her profane language could offend more customers or be picked up by children.

Who's a pretty ****ing boy then? An African Grey has been thrown out of the Norcutts Garden Centre in Ashton, Greater Manchester, for a string of foul-mouthed rants. Staff are hoping to re-educate her (file photo)

Notice: This sign was put on Ruby's cage after she offended customers with what staff called 'naughty words'

All is not lost, however - as they are hoping to re-educate Ruby with a more polite vocabulary and return her to public display so she can find a loving home.

A spokesman for Norcutts said: 'We decided to remove her from the centre after receiving a number of complaints about her repeating rude words, and her content was getting much worse.

'We've no idea where she's learned it from, but we felt it would be best to take her off the shop floor.

'It's a very funny incident, but hopefully Ruby can soon return.'

The first customers knew of Ruby's punishment was when a sign appeared on her cage announcing what had happened.

Re-education: The parrot will be retrained with a more polite vocabulary and return to the shop floor

It said: 'Ruby our African Grey parrot has picked up some naughty words and has decided to say them repeatedly.

'We can only offer our apologies if this causes offence.'

It added: 'Please do not put fingers or objects through the bars of Ruby's cage as she may bite.'

The message was picked up by the local MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, Labour's Jonathan Reynolds, who spotted it on a family day out on Sunday and posted it on Twitter.

'We'd been out for a Mother's Day meal and decided to take the kids over to the garden centre to look at the animals,' he said.

'Ruby was still there at this point but thankfully she was on her best behaviour and we didn't hear a single swear word from her.'

A spokesman for Norcutts, which runs the centre, said: 'We've no idea where she's learned it from'

African Greys have been dubbed the Einsteins of the parrot world for their intelligence.

A 2012 study found the birds were capable of thinking at the same intellectual level as a young human child.

Scientists at the University of Vienna in Austria put the parrots in front of two opaque boxes, one of which contained a piece of walnut which rattled when shaken.

More times than could simply be put down to chance, the parrots chose the rattling box - correctly deducing that there must be food inside.

Over time, when presented with the two boxes, they could even guess that the food was in the second box straight away when the first made no noise.
