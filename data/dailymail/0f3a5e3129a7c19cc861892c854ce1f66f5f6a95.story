Earlier this week, a charger that could power a device from 20ft away was revealed, and now visitors to the Consumer Electronics Show have been treated to one that charges devices in just 30 seconds.

In less than the time it takes to boil a kettle, StoreDot can take a phone’s battery from zero to fully charged thanks to a breakthrough in nanotechnology.

It was showcased at the Las Vegas event, which has also displayed smart dartboards, a three-wheeled car and Meccano's Short Circuit-style dancing robot.

StoreDot technology was first demonstrated last year, but the prototype at the time was too chunky to fit inside slim phones. But the latest model of the StoreDot phone and charging dock (pictured) being shown off at CES, has been streamlined. The company plans to make it even thinner by 2016

StoreDot technology was first demonstrated last year, but the prototype at the time was too chunky to fit inside slim phones.

But the latest model of the StoreDot phone, being shown off at CES, has been streamlined and the company plans to make it even thinner by 2016.

The technology was developed at Tel Aviv University.

Researchers discovered tiny naturally occurring crystals were able to store a charge or emit light.

The crystals - dubbed NanoDots - are two nanometers in diameter and contain short chains of amino acids called peptides.

They cover 'cavities' over an electrode in a standard battery.

This extends how much of the battery can be used to create a reaction, which leads to a charge. 

StoreDot claims NanoDots can boost battery capacity tenfold.

At one end of the electrode, the crystals act as a capacitor to store energy. 

At the other end, the crystals pass this energy into the battery’s lithium at much faster speeds and efficiency than current batteries. 

The technology was developed at Tel Aviv University.

The crystals - dubbed NanoDots - are two nanometers in diameter and contain short chains of amino acids called peptides.

The experts said they are easy and cheap to make, and are non-toxic.

The firm is working on using the crystals, which it calls NanoDots, for displays and semiconductors as well as batteries.

For example, the NanoDots can replace toxic materials like cadmium used in displays, and can be created in a wide variety of colours.

The technology can’t be fitted to existing phones because the current batteries wouldn’t be able to handle the surge and change in power. 

But the team behind the project told the BBC that a number of major manufacturers have approached the company to licence the technology. 

This could see it introduced on next-generation handsets as standard.

Samsung announced its Galaxy Edge phone last year, and has been demonstrating the curved screen model all this week. 

An LG-branded phone is on display that featured a similar curved screen, which bends around the sides, according to reports by Korean news site inews24.

StoreDot (original prototype pictured) was developed at Tel Aviv University. Researchers discovered tiny naturally occurring crystals were able to store a charge or emit light. The crystals - dubbed NanoDots - are two nanometers in diameter and contain short chains of amino acids called peptides

However, the phone was only showcased to a select group of people and was built by LG Display.

LG Display create screen technology for other companies and LG told MailOnline the handset was a prototype display, and not a prototype phone being developed for consumers.

At this year's show, LG has also launched a range of innovative household products including a dual-washing machine, and a fridge within a fridge.

Hong Kong firm Muudarts revealed prototypes of its smart darts and boards (pictured). When used together, sensors on the dart track its speed, trajectory and location, while the board scores the game automatically

Muudarts' wristband is also on display. It tracks the users throw and gives feedback via an app (pictured). Prices weren’t announced, and the firm said its smart products are ‘coming soon’

And during tests, it demonstrated that its power pack 80V battery is so powerful it can lift a 12lb (5kg) bowling ball when the pack is fitted in a vacuum cleaner, for example.

Wearables have been a common theme across the event, and there are even fitness trackers for darts.

Developed by Muudarts, the wristband tracks the users throw and gives feedback via an app.

The Hong Kong-based firm also showcased prototypes of its smart darts and dart boards.

When used together, sensors on the dart track its speed, trajectory and location on the board.

Elsewhere, Meccano demonstrated its 4ft-tall (1.2 metre) Meccanoid G15 KS robot (pictured) that can mirror a person’s movements, remember audio, walk and dance. It can also be rebuilt into different shapes, and movements are controlled using either an app or by voice

The bot (pictured left), which resembles Johnny Five from the 1986 film Short Circuit (pictured right), is expected to go on sale in the second half of 2015 and kits will start at $400 (£265)

Startup Petalite recently announced an external battery for a phone that can be charged to 100 per cent in 15 minutes. 

Called Petalite Flux, it is currently seeking funding on Indiegogo.  

The board then automatically calculates the score the players. Prices and release dates weren’t announced, and the firm’s website says its smart products are ‘coming soon.’

Another wearable on display is the Scout5000, from Motorola. 

Created in partnership with video streaming developer Hubble, the Scout5000 lets owners track the physical health of their pet, while a built-in camera allows them to see the world through their dog's eyes. 

Although a number of the products showcased at CES have been 3D printed, the printers themselves have not featured as highly as at previous shows.

However, Makerbot did use the event to unveil its next-level materials that expands the effects achievable.

Audi, Mercedes and Toyota stole the show in terms of futuristic cars this year, but a lesser-known brand also used the event to demonstrate its bizarre-looking vehicle. Elio Motors’ three-wheeled Elio (pictured) seats two passengers and goes 0 to 60 mph in 9.6 seconds. The firm hopes to make 250,000 cars a year by 2016

Typically, 3D printing uses plastics - although machines have been built that use chocolate and even pancake batter.

MakerBot has taken this a step further and developed a range of plastic materials designed to mimic wood, metal and stone. 

It said the wood can be sanded, and the metals can be developed to be magnetic, similar to some real metals - but exactly how this plastic will become magnetised has not been revealed. 

It could contain tiny particles of metal or filaments, for example.

The firm also said the weight of each material is similar to what the user would expect, and they will go on sale later this year. Prices were not announced.

Elsewhere, Meccano demonstrated its 4ft-tall (1.2 metre) Meccanoid G15 KS robot that can mirror a person’s movements, remember audio, walk and dance.

Elio is the same length as a Honda Fit, but half the weight at 1,250lbs (570kg), allowing it to do 84 miles to the gallon. Because it has three wheels - two in front and one in the rear - the Elio is classified as a motorcycle by the US government. The car costs $6,800 (£4,075) and more than 27,000 people have reserved a model

That's close to the number Mazda sells in the US.

But Elio Motors founder Paul Elio said the vehicle has all the safety features of a car, such as an anti-lock brakes, front and side air bags and a steel cage that surrounds the occupants.
