A 94-year-old man gave airport security staff the surprise of a lifetime when they realized he was carrying a loaded .38-caliber gun on his hip at a checkpoint.  

Staff at LaGuardia Airport said the man entered a body scanner on Wednesday with the dangerous weapon clipped to his belt. 

The Transportation Security Administration said the firearm had at least six rounds in it, and was hooked on the man's belt near the small of his back as he stepped into the scanner.

There are no further details on the identity of the man or why he was trying to board a plane with a handgun.
