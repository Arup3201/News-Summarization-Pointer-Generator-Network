Hacked: Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell has apologised to Facebook users after his page was hacked

Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell has described a series of wall posts left by a Facebook hacker on his personal page as 'stupid' and 'obscene'.

Republican General Powell had his Facebook page broken into allegedly by the same hacker said to have illegally accessed the email accounts of several members of former President George W Bush's family.

The hacker, who uses the handle 'Guccifer', began uploading messages disparaging former President George W Bush yesterday morning.

One post read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!'

In one bizarre post, the hacker ranted: 'Kill the illuminati! Tomorrowâ€™s world will be a world free of illuminati or will be no more!'

As well as the offensive posts, some of which insulted Powell himself, pictures were uploaded to Powell's Facebook page showing screen grabs of the hacker's previous access to email accounts of Mr Bush and his siblings Neil and Dorothy.

According to thesmokinggun.com, the posts included two paintings by Mr Bush that he had emailed to his sister in December last year and a photo sent by Neil Bush to his siblings also in December.

An album with 18 images entitled 'George "Dubya" Walker Bush Hacking' is reported to have been posted on the page with each photo branded with a handwritten 'Guccifer' inscription.

General Powell later took to Facebook and posted an apology to more than 82,000 people who 'like' his page, acknowledging that his page had been hacked.

He posted: Dear Friends, as most of you realize, my fb page has obviously been hacked. I'm sorry you have to see all the stupid, obscene posts that are popping up.

Offensive: One of the bizarre posts made by the hacker included this one which read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!'

Bizarre: The hacker posted a series of rants on General Powell's page as well as a series of photos which are believed to have been taken from former President George W Bush's hacked email account

'Please ignore as we are working with fb to take care of this problem. I appreciate your patience.'

Once full control of his page had been restored, he added: 'Dear Friends, I'm happy to report that the hacking problem has been fixed.

'We have been working with fb this morning and they took immediate action to remedy the situation.'

Dozens of those who follow his Facebook posts took to the site to welcome the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff back to the site.
