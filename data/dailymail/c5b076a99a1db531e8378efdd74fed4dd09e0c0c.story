While labour is often a intense experience, few mothers can boast of such a dramatic track record as one mother-of-seven.

Sheep farmer Amanda Owen has had three of her babies - including her latest - in motorway laybys while en route to the hospital, and a fourth in an army garrison she was passing when the baby put in its speedy appearance.

It is little wonder she struggles to make it to the maternity ward: Amanda, 38, lives on a remote sheep farm in the Yorkshire Dales which is two hours' drive from the nearest hospital.

The latest addition, a little 7lb girl 
called Annas, arrived at 1.25am last Wednesday after the ambulance 
pulled over in a layby

Amanda with (L-R) Sidney , 18 months, baby Annas and Edith, 4, all of whom were born on road laybys after Amanda's labour progressed suddenly

Add to this the fact that Amanda often has extremely fast labours - sometimes giving birth in as little as eight minutes.

Amanda has been told by her doctors she can’t give birth at home, because she lives too far away from medical help if anything goes wrong.

She has also been instructed not to call for an ambulance until she is certain the baby is on its way, meaning she has frequently made her own way to the hospital.

Amanada Owen, seen here with baby Edith, has been told that she can not have home birth because she is at a higher risk and her home is too far from medical help

'It is a catch-22 situation,' said Amanda, who runs the 2,000-acre, 900-sheep Ravenseat Farm, near Kirkby Stephen, with husband Clive.

'Because where we live is so remote, ambulances will not come unless they are sure I am in labour and I cannot have a home birth because I am deemed high risk,' she explains.

The latest addition to the family, a 7lb girl called Annas, arrived at 1.25am last Wednesday after Amanda had, in fact, been picked up in an ambulance after she woke in the night with labour pains.

The ambulance pulled over in a layby at Keld, just down the road from her home.

The ambulance had come from one of the nearer ambulance stations, at Bainbridge, North Yorkshire, 40 minutes away. It was on its way to the Friarage Hospital at Northallerton.

Despite her colourful history of giving birth, Amanda has not ruled out having another child in the future

North Yorkshire, more than 50 miles away along winding country roads.

'I have a history of quick labour,' she said. 'I’m not allowed to come into hospital by myself.

'On Tuesday I ran around after the sheep, had some pork scratchings and my contractions started without warning.

'I woke up at midnight, poked my husband and told him to get an ambulance. We only got as far as the layby at Keld three miles away.

'It only took ten minutes from stopping to having a new baby. I told the ambulance to just take me home but I had to go to hospital.'

Edith, four, was also born in an ambulance at a layby. She arrived about an hour into the journey at West Witton, North Yorkshire.

And Sidney, aged 18 months, arrived in a layby at Reeth, about half an hour from home.

Before she was banned from driving to hospital her husband was driving her to hospital in his Land Rover when she realised she wouldn’t make it.

Seven-year-old Miles was born at the vast Catterick Garrison, near Richmond, North Yorkshire, after bemused soldiers found a room for her.

Her first child, Raven ,12, was planned as a home birth because of the foot and mouth epidemic, but it was a difficult birth and in the end she had to be rushed into hospital for a C-section.

Then came Reuben, 10 weeks premature, born at home.

And Violet, three, who made her big entrance at hospital, after a super-quick eight-minute labour.

'We had a nurse come around to show me some exercises,' said Amanda.

'I said I will just carry on working because it is the same movements for sheep shearing.'

Despite their already large family, Amanda remains coy about adding to the brood.

'We don’t plan things like this, there may or may not be more.'
