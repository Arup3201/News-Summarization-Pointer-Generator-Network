A champion boxer faces 26 years in prison after prosecutors charged him with allegedly shooting his cousin at his Arkansas home in August. 

Jermain Taylor, 36, faces charges of first-degree battery and first-degree terroristic threatening after police say he opened fire on Tyrone DaWayne Hinton on August 26 - wounding his 41-year-old relative. 

Prosecutors took nearly three months to determine whether to file formal charges against Taylor - a champion middleweight boxer who won the bronze medal at the 2000 Olympic games in Sydney, Australia.

Taylor allegedly seriously wounded his cousin when he opened fire following an argument at his home

He was arrested at his home following the shooting in August, but was free on bail and continued to train and fight. 

Police say that Taylor's cousin, Hinton, and another man went to the boxer's house on August 26 and got into an argument with him. 

Taylor's wife called 911 and Hinton fled. He was found a short time later in the parking lot of a nearby Dollar General store and treated at the hospital for serious injuries. 

He won the International Boxing Federation middleweight title on October 8 after defeating Sam Soliman in Biloxi, Mississippi, 

Taylor's lawyer has refused to comment. 

However, he has filed a motion challenging the legality of Taylor's arrest and asked that evidence collected from that arrest be barred from use in court.

It took prosecutors nearly three months to decide whether to file charges against Taylor

If convicted of the two felonies, Taylor faces 26 years in prison. 

Taylor, a Little Rock native, is a favorite son of Arkansas, frequently mentioning his love for his home state and the Arkansas Razorbacks football team. 

He is in the midst of a comeback in his boxing career after leaving for over two years following four devastating losses between 2007 and 2009.

Since his return in 2011, he has won all five of his matches.
