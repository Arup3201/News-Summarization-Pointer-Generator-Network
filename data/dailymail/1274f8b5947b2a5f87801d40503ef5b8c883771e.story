Tragic Tetra Pak billionaire Hans Rausing has celebrated his marriage to Christie's art expert Julia Delves Broughton four months after saying 'I do' with a glittering party in Mayfair.

The couple married in front of just 60 guests at private ceremony in July, but marked their nuptials with a larger event at prestigious venue One Mayfair last night, with friends in attendance including musician and television presenter Jools Holland, who attended with his wife Christabel.

The bride was given away by Lord Teddy Derby, with Brian Ferry's son Otis, his model girlfriend Edie Campbell and his mother Lucy Birley also in attendance, as well as Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason.

The marriage marks a fresh start for Mr Rausing, whose first wife, Eva, died in 2012 as a result of cocaine abuse. Her decomposing body was found at their £70million Chelsea home several weeks later. 

Former heroin addict Mr Rausing, 50, first met Ms Delves Broughton, 53, in 2002, but is thought to have re-kindled the relationship after he entered a psychiatric hospital following his former wife's tragic death.

American-born Eva had died from an overdose, but Mr Rausing had hidden her body under a mound of bin bags and bedding for two 
months while maintaining a  pretence to servants that she was 
still alive.

He said she was suffering a fever and he was taking her temperature three times a day.

Rausing was convicted in July 2012 of preventing her lawful burial and handed a ten-month suspended jail term.

The judge at Isleworth Crown Court said Mr Rausing was a tragic warning of the 'utterly destructive' effects of drug abuse.

Judge Richard McGregor-Johnson told Rausing as he sentenced him: 'If ever there was an illustration of the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families, it is to be found in the facts of this case.

'You and your wife had every material advantage imaginable, and for a time a happy family life. Your relapse into the misuse of drugs, together with that of your wife, destroyed all that.'

Mr Rausing
 - whose Swedish grandfather founded the lucrative food packaging firm 
in 1951 - met Eva Kemeny while they were both enrolled on a drugs rehabilitation programme.

They married in 1992 and had four children, but both struggled with their addictions.

In July 2012 Mr Rausing was stopped by police after driving erratically through morning rush hour traffic in Wandsworth, south London and arrested for possession of class A drugs. 

When they later raided his house, 48-year-old Mrs Rausing was so badly decomposed that she had to be identified from a fingerprint and the serial number on her heart pacemaker.

Following Eva's death, Mr Rausing moved out of his Belgravia house to undergo a rehabilitation programme at a private clinic, living at the private hospital for two years.

Ms Delves Broughton, who works for auctioneers Christie's at their London showroom, was there to support Rausing when he came out of the clinic and they became engaged in March while on holiday in Barbados.

She is the younger sister of fashionista Isabella Blow, who took her own life in May 2007.

Mr Rausing's wealth comes from the world's largest food packaging firm, Tetra Pak, which was founded in Sweden by his grandfather. Like several other members of the family, Mr Rausing settled in London. 

Private benefactor Mr Rausing, who has given tens of millions of pounds to charities including The HALO Trust – which removes land mines left behind in wars – museums and veterans' foundations, first met Ms Delves Broughton at Christies in 2002.  

He and Eva had gone to lunch at the auction house, where Ms Delves Broughton began working as a secretary 18 years ago. She quickly rose through the ranks, working in Old Masters, then the Valuation Department, before becoming a senior director working for Lord Linley in the Chairman's Office.

They then met again in 2006 when Hans, a serious art collector, called Christie's in to make a valuation at his home in Belgravia.

Their romance and his recovery have been compared with Victoria Getty rescuing her husband Sir Paul Getty from addiction and helping him to become one of Britain's greatest philanthropists. 

They married in July at Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, with the Earl of Derby giving her away and Detmar Blow, ex-husband of her late sister, among the small number of guests.
