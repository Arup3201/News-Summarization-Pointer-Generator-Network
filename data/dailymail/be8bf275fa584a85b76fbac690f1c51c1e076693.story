A school bus driver and a teenage student were killed when a train collided with their vehicle in snowy North Dakota.

Twelve passengers are being treated for serious injuries following the incident near Larimore at 3.45pm on Monday.

The bus was dropping children home when it was hit on the passenger side near the front doors by an empty freight train.

It is not clear how the vehicles crossed paths, though local reports claim the bus 'failed to yield' to the oncoming train, owned by freight train company BNSF.

Paramedics said the driver, 62, and student killed in the crash were ejected from the vehicle and into the snow, according to WDAZ8.

Helicopters and ambulances were called to airlift the wounded to nearby hospitals and Larimore Elementary Principal Leslie Wiegandt arrived at the scene.

Highway Patrol officials claim the conditions were clear.

The train owned by BNSF Railway - America's second-largest railroad network after Union Pacific - was empty at the time of the crash, BNSF spokesman Amy McBeth told WDAZ.
