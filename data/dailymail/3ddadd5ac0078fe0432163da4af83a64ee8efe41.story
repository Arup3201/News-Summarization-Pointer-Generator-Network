Jack Straw's son has caused a stir today after posting a photograph on Twitter celebrating an Easter tradition with Morris dancers with blacked-up faces.

Will Straw, 32, who has been selected by Labour to fight one of the party's top target seats at next year's general election, uploaded the tweet after meeting The Britannia Coconutters.

The 32-year-old, who is hoping to win back the Rossendale and Darwen constituency in East Lancashire, responded to the outcry - some have branded the tradition 'racist' - defending the historic performances and urging people to find out more via the group's website.

He tweeted: 'Just checked 
back on twitter & (sic) seen torrent of ignorant tweets on Britannia
 Coconut dancers. Nothing racist about it', posting a link to the 
dancer's website.

Controversy: Will Straw, the son of former Home Secretary Jack Straw, sparked anger after posting a picture of himself with the Britannia Coconut Dancers, after watching their traditional Easter Saturday performances in the Pennine town of Bacup

Tradition: The 32-year-old, who was selected by the Labour party to run for one of their top target seats in East Lancashire at next year's general election, has been branded a 'racist' by people responding to his tweet (pictured). Others moved to defend the group, revealing its historic connections with the area

The Britannia Coconut Dancers take to the streets of the town of Bacup every Easter Saturday, performing their folk dances across the town

The group, who dress up in turbans and red and white skirts and clogs, congregate on Easter Saturday every year in the Penine town of Bacup.

The tradition, which dates back to the turn of the century, sees the dancers perform through the streets, from one edge of the town to the other over a 12-hour period.

The group's website reveals: 'The dances they perform are actually folk dances and the custom of blackened faces may reflect a pagan or medieval background which was done to disguise the dancers from being recognised by evil spirits afterwards, it may also reflect mining connections.'

But being pictured with the group has landed Mr Straw in hot water today, after the Twitter community reacted with shock at his being photographed with the dancers.

The message posted alongside the picture, reads: 'Good to talk to Neville Earnshaw of world famous Britannia Coconutters in the New Inn. Great Bacup tradition.'

The tweet has provoked dozens of responses, with some labeling the tradition 'racist'.

@VoluntaryAnarch wrote: 'Jack Straw's son @wdjstraw parachuted into Rossendale, praises a racist custom as a "great tradition" to ingratiate himself with the locals.'

@PndsC added: '@wdjstraw Are you f****** serious? Jesus christ, why did you think this was a good idea?'

@STYLISA tweeted: '@wdjstraw You do realise that this picture is pretty offensive don't you?'

And @TonyM70 said: '@WikiGuido @wdjstraw A tradition? Like lynching used to be? Doesn't make it right.'

Meanwhile others moved to show their support for the Morris dancers, recognising the tradition.

@yorkierosie urged people to 'do some research before taking to stirring', offering a link to the Britannia Coconut Dancers website.

Mr Straw told MailOnline the tradition must be treasured and preserved.

He said: 'As many small towns throughout Britain struggle to maintain their identity against a tide of high street chains, betting shops and fast food outlets, Bacup’s annual dance  provides a window into a previous era and a clear sense of local tradition.

'Whatever the origins, we should all hope it will continue for many centuries to come.'

Mr Straw's target seat was held by Labour before the 2010 general election when the Tories' Jake Berry won it with a majority of 4,493.

The son of the former Home Secretary, an ex-Fulbright scholar and Oxford graduate, beat five other local candidates to win the post.

As a 17-year-old Straw junior was caught trying to sell cannabis to undercover reporters, while his father was in the Cabinet.

He was forced to write to Mr Blair apologising for 'letting down and embarrassing the Labour Party'.

Mr Straw is the first in a long line of 'red princes and princesses' whose parents are MPs, to win selection for the 2015 election.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair's son Euan is said to be targetting the ultra-safe seat of Bootle, Merseyside ahead of the election campaign.

The Labour Party declined to comment.

The Britannia Coconut Dancers, known as the 'Nutters', are part of the history of the small Penine town of Bacup.

Every Easter Saturday the troupe of men - dressed in red and white kilts and clogs, with their faces blackened - take to the streets of the town to dance their way from one side to the other.

They perform folk dances, which are said to have originated with Moorish pirates.

The custom of blackened faces, reflects, according to their website, a 'pagan or medieval background' to 'disguise the dancers from being recognised by evil spirits'.

The tradition is said to originate from Moorish pirates who first settled in Cornwall and moved north as the mines opened in Lancashire

It is also thought to link to the town's mining heritage.

Moorish pirates who settled in Cornwall and found themselves employed in the mines are said to have brought the dances to British shores.

As mines and quaries opened in Lancashire in the 18th and 19th Centuries, a number of Cornish men travelled north. With them they brought the dances and the traditions now upheld by the Nutters.

The dances spread throughout the Rossendale area, and at the turn of the century four dance troupes existed. It is from the Tunstead Mill Troupe that the Britannia group descended.

The dances are accompanied by the English concertina, and for Easter Saturday the group are joined by a silver band.

The music, like the dance steps, has been handed down from generation to generation.

The 'Nutters' have performed across the world, including taking to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall for the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
