Oregon State University is firing first lady Michelle Obama's brother Craig Robinson as head coach of their men's basketball team.

A source told Sports Illustrated about the sacking on Monday, which brings to a close Robinson's six-year term with the Pac-12 team.

While the president's brother-in-law ends his tenure with a losing record of 93-104 and no NCAA tournament appearances, he was once a beacon of hope for the sub-par Beavers.

In his first year on the job, Robinson inherited a team that lost 21 straight Pac-10 games, turning the crew around for a 19-win season in 2008-2009. 

But this season the team finished with a lackluster 16-16 record and are now losing all of their starting players.

However, the Beavers' failing record is unsurprising for a team which hasn't made it to the NCAA tournament since 1990. Jay John, who coached the team before Robinson, ended his five plus seasons with the Beavers with an even worse 28-68 record.

Robinson still has three more years remaining in his contract which means the school is set to owe him more than $4million.

Robinson started at the Corvallis, Oregon college the same year Barack Obama was elected president. 

During his six years with the team, Robinson brought the West Coast team to DC for a few games. In November, the president, first lady and daughters Malia and Sasha watched court-side as the Beavers beat Maryland.

Robinson even helped secure his sister as commencement speaker for the school in  2012. 

It's unclear where Robinson will head next, but his brother-in-law, a noted basketball aficionado, has often spoke about his talent as a coach.

'Craig Robinson is an outstanding coach. ... Anybody in Oregon and anybody who knows sports knows he turned it around. He loves Corvallis and I'm sure that as a young, successful coach he's going to start getting offers,' Mr Obama said in 2009.
