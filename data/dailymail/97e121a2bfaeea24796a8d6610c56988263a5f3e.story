The wife of Formula One motor racing team chief Sir Frank Williams has died after a two-year battle with cancer.

Lady Virginia Williams, 66, passed away  peacefully at home last Thursday with her husband and family at her bedside.

A statement from the Williams Grand Prix team said: 'It is with great sadness that we 
report the death of Lady Virginia Williams, wife of Williams founder and team principal Sir Frank Williams.

'Lady Virginia, or ‘Ginny’ as she was 
better known, died peacefully at the family home. Ginny had been bravely 
battling cancer for the past two and a half years.

Author: Lady Williams told of her life with husband Frank in a book

'It goes without saying that Virginia 
Williams played an enormous role in getting Sir Frank through the 
aftermath of his road car accident  and she had been a rock in his life ever since.

'Ginny will always be an integral part of Williams’ history and success, and today we pay tribute to a much loved member of the Williams family who will be sorely missed.

'Please respect the family’s wishes for privacy at this time.'

In a moving tribute, McLaren racing chairman Ron Dennis described Lady Williams as a 'truly great lady.'

He said: 'I'm extremely saddened to hear the news. Ginny, as we always called her, was friendly and fun, yet also a tower of strength and intelligence.

'She supported my old friend Frank through many triumphs and disasters, treating those two imposters just the same, over a long and happy marriage.

'She'll be missed not only by the Williams family, to whom we offer our condolences at this very difficult time, but also by the entire motorsport community worldwide.'

The Williams have three children, Claire, Jonathan and Jaime.

In 1991, Lady Williams wrote an extraordinary book, ‘A Different Kind of Life,’ about her relationship with Frank and the impact the car accident 27 years ago last Friday which left him in a wheelchair,  had on their lives together.

In it she revealed they first met in 1967, when she was engaged to an aspiring F3 driver and working as a receptionist.

After her marriage hit trouble, she began a relationship with Frank, and following her divorce, they married in August 1974 in a ceremony hurriedly squeezed in between races.

She played a largely uncredited role in helping Frank through his difficult early years in F1, giving up her job and even loaning him money after selling her London apartment before their marriage.

The book also recounts the huge sacrifices she made as Frank used every spare penny to keep the team going.
