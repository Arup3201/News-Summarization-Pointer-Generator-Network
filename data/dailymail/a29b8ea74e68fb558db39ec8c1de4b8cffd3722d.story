He has refused all entreaties to don Vatican finery, preferring to stick with his simple white cassock and iron cross.

So worshippers were somewhat surprised to see Pope Francis sporting a new accessory yesterday.

The pontiff was briefly seen wearing a wood and gold rosary necklace...dangling from his ear.

Listen up: Pope Francis appears momentarily to be unaware a rosary is hanging from his right ear at the end of mass in St Peter's Square

What this hear: Pope Francis pulls the rosary from his ear which had been thrown by a pilgrim during mass

Chuckle: Pope Francis laughs when he realises a rosary has been thrown to him as toured the crowds in his Popemobile

That's mine: A smiling Pope Francis puts the prized rosary in his pocket and finishes off the mass

An enthusiastic pilgrim had thrown the rosary beads at Francis, as he circled the crowds in his Popemobile at the end of a mass in Rome’s St Peter’s square.

The Pope’s security riding alongside him were seemingly oblivious to the arrival of the unexpected present.

Francis looked momentarily startled as he felt something hanging next to his cheek. But when he saw the beads, he chuckled before putting them in his pocket.

Last June he had caught a rosary thrown by the faithful to the amusement of the crowd who applauded.

Today's Marian Day mass, was attended by a 100,000 crowd, said Vatican Radio.

Since his inauguration Francis has ditched much of the finery in which his predecessors bedecked themselves

He shunned the gold cross traditionally worn by Popes and has refused to wear the designer scarlet loafers made famous by his predecessor, Pope Benedict
