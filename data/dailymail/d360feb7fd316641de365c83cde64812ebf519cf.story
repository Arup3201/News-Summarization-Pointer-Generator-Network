She has featured on its glossy pages countless times but today, Cara Delevingne hit out at fashion bible Vogue after it claimed the supermodel fell asleep during an interview.

Writing about her meeting with Cara in London, American Vogue's Plum Sykes claimed that the party-loving model was late for their meeting at smart private member's club, Grace Belgravia, insisting she 'always wakes up 10 minutes before she has to go anywhere.'

She also said that the 21-year-old requested a massage prior to their interview and fell asleep, causing the meeting to be cut short.

Hitting back: American Vogue has claimed that Cara Delevingne fell asleep during an interview and the model has hit back on Twitter branding the fashion bible 'liars'

Sykes explains that Cara was in pain from too much kickboxing and wanted the pair to enjoy a massage before the interview so that they could both be 'relaxed.' Sykes was left waiting half an hour after the massage ended, only to be informed that Cara had fallen asleep.

In her article about the episode, Sykes writes: 'Cara finally appears, looking refreshed after her rest. “I’m so sorry!!!” she exclaims, collapsing into a chair. “I fall asleep everywhere! Someone recently asked if they could publish a book of pictures of me sleeping, because there are so many.”

Cara’s personal assistant then informed Sykes that Cara wasn't hanging around or going to Hackney City Farm with her as they had planned and was instead off to do some film recording, followed by hair and make-up, a fitting for her Met ball outfit with Stella McCartney, a Fendi-store launch party, all rounded off by dinner with Karl Lagerfeld.

Sykes goes on to explain that she then called photographer Tim Walker, who has worked with Cara many times, only to be told by him that on every shoot he's done with her, Cara's fallen asleep (even snoozing for seven whole hours on a Mulberry shoot.)

Speaking out: Cara took to Twitter to explain to her 1.7m followers that the fashion industry 'is not the most understanding or compassionate' of industries

Sykes discovers that Cara had been out partying with Lily Allen the night before their meeting and later calls Cara to ask about her love of a good night out and her resulting reputation.

'Well, the going out is more to do with the fact that I am literally jet-lagged all the time,' Cara told Sykes.

'I can’t sleep in the evenings. Most of the pictures people see of me are me going to work events: a Fendi dinner one night, a Prada dinner the next, and working all day.

'Actually, compared to anyone else my age that I know, I really go out so little,' she tells her.

The article was posted in the early hours of the morning and Cara was quick to respond.

Cover girl: While Cara has featured on the glossy cover of British Vogue, Cara doesn't appear to be too happy with the American version after the article they wrote about her

She took to Twitter and wrote: 'Why do people in the industry lie so much???? They would rather see you fail than succeed. What happened to supporting each other? It’s even worse when your [sic] trying to fight people that have all the power because then you are powerless.

'All I can say is I work extremely hard and ‘sleeping’ is proof that sometimes I work too hard. I apologise for being so ambitious. This just shows that the fashion industry is not the most understanding or compassionate of industries.

'That only applies to the people that sit around not really caring and never really bothering to get to know you or what it’s really like. What happened to supporting each other?'.

Party girl: The Vogue article alludes to how much Cara, pictured here with Kate Moss, enjoys a good night out

Cara is currently enjoying the best of both work and play as she shoots her latest fashion campaign in Bali.

Cara was evidently in high spirits as she posed for a fun topless shot with a friend today after posting her rant on Twitter.

The
 21-year-old model cupped her hands over her chest as she goofed around 
for the camera, kissing a green soft toy, which she balanced in the air 
with a female pal.

Cara has been working in the idyllic paradise location in a campaign for acclaimed fashion photographer, Sebastian Faena, and has been sharing a series of racy shots.

Motivational message: Cara shared an inspirational quote on her Instagram page after her Twitter rant about the offending article

In little more than 
two years, Cara has reached
supermodel status, 
but in a 
recent interview she seemed a tad downbeat about her chosen industry.

While she acknowledges her ‘luck’ at having achieved so much in such a short space of time, she told Alexis Petridis of The Guardian that young girls should be aspiring for careers that are more intellectually demanding.

When asked what she’d do if her daughter 
wanted to become a model, she replied: ‘I’d say no, if that’s all she 
aspired to. You know, I get a lot of girls who say, I just want to be a 
model so badly. And I think: You can do better than that.

‘I mean, look, I do love it, I’m not saying anything bad about it, I just think you can do a lot more.’

She
adds: ‘I was incredibly lucky to do as well as I’ve done, it’s not 
easy, there’s so many models go through so much s**t, and it’s just, if 
you have a brain, which everyone does, use it and try and do something 
else.’

Success: Cara Delevingne's fortunes have changed
drastically over the last two years. From comparatively humble 
beginnings as a fashion intern at Asos, she is now one of the world's 
most successful, and sought after young models 

Cara’s ascent began in the offices of 
fashion website Asos in 2012, where she was ‘discovered’ by Burberry’s 
Christopher Bailey while working as an intern. 

‘As
a model, I really stand for not being a model, if that makes sense,’ 
she said.  ‘When I started, the whole idea of the model was very 
different, it was a bit stuck-up. Not stuck-up, but no one was trying to
have fun, or not even have fun, but be willing to smile.’

That
smile, allied with a series of comedic expressions, has become 
something of a trademark - and a magnet for the cameras that follow her 
every move.

What's 
more, the star admits she would love to quit modelling herself one day 
and go away and make a music album for six months.

She said: 'That's what I'd f**king love to do. And when this shit doesn't work out, yeah, I will block that out and do it.'
