Most people reach for the sun hat and lotion during the summer months, but one young boy has such sensitive skin he has to be covered in Factor 50 cream every day.

Alexander Dewar, four, has albinism, which means he has very little pigment in his skin, hair and eyes making him extremely susceptible to skin cancers.

He must stay away from the sun as much as possible but when his parents Isla, 34, and Craig, 40, do take him out they have to cover him in factor 50 sun block.

Alexander wears glasses because he is partially sighted and suffers from involuntary eye movement and photophobia.

The family home in Kelty, Fife, Scotland, is also fitted out with dark blinds to keep out the light and their car has tinted windows.

Mrs Dewar said that when Alexander was born she was shocked, as unlike his older siblings Matthew, 9, and Bethany, 6, his hair was white, his skin was pale and his violet eyes were tightly shut.

She said: 'He didn't open his eyes for the first three or four days and we were worried that he was blind.

'My other two children were born with dark hair, we had no idea we had the albinism gene. It was quite a shock because nobody else in the family had it and it was a steep learning curve.'

Isla said that initially doctors failed to recognise the condition and only diagnosed albinism four months after he was born.

She said: 'I didn't know anything about albinism. I knew he was different but I didn't know what it was then. The only place I could find out was the internet.'

Alexander only managed to open his eyes outside when he was seven months old and even then only when wearing dark sunglasses.

Mrs Dewar said: 'We got him some wraparound sunglasses and it was a really exciting day to see him open his eyes.

'He wears a big hat when he's outside and can only see his feet, he'll never be able to drive a car but he has enough vision to get around.

'Because he's got no melanin, the way his eyes are connected to his brain is quite different, which has an impact on what he sees as well.'

Neither of Alexander's siblings Matthew and Bethany have albinism

Protection: Alexander must always wear factor 50 as he is susceptible to skin cancers

Mrs Dewar said one of the hardest things about the condition was dealing with others comments.

She said: 'What I've learnt is most people are just curious and my response is to be positive. He does get people looking at him but its more me and my husband who are bothered - he can't see them very well!

'He's not fussy about people asking him because he doesn't want to be different. We've taught him to be patient and kind about it, but it will get harder as he gets older.

'We're educating his brother and sister, because they hear people talking about him and don't really know what to say.

'My eldest son gets very upset and doesn't want people saying things about his wee brother.'

Alexander will start Kelty primary in August and the school have been adapting lighting and putting up UV shields for him.

The family are looking at white stick training and guide dogs for Alexander and are thinking of sending him to Edinburgh Royal Blind School when he's older.

Mrs Dewar said that her only hope for the future is that Alexander gets to live a meaningful life as possible, doing something he wants to do.

She added: 'I just want him to be able to go where he wants to and do what he wants to.

'It's just a bit of extra work to get him there, at the end of the day he could have something far worse.

'Yes his vision's poor, yes he's a little bit different, but he's got so much going for him.'
