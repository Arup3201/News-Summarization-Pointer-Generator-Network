David Cameron is to unveil plans for a cap on the number of European migrants joining Britain's workforce every year as part of negotiations with Brussels, it has emerged. 

The Prime Minister is expected to announce his 'red line' plans for immigration in a speech designed to win back voters from Ukip as pressure mounts on the Government to reconsider Britain's position in the EU. 

As part of the measures, a cap would be placed on the number of National Insurance numbers given out to foreigners coming to work in the UK.

David Cameron is expected to announce plans for a cap on immigration in speeches designed to set out the Conservatives' 'red line' rules on EU membership 

Any that are given out will be monitored and given a time limit, the Sunday Times reports. 

The plans will form part of the Government's negotiation strategy for Britain's future in the EU ahead of a 2017 referendum, sources said. 

The cap will ensure no more than 100,000 new migrant workers join the UK a year. However critics have claimed withdrawing National Insurance numbers will not push migrants out of the UK's workforce, but merely steer them towards the black market. 

A senior Whitehall source told the newspaper: 'The latest thinking in No 10 is that you would have an annual cap on the national insurance numbers issued to long-term low-skilled European migrants.

'There would be a quota system to have time-limited national insurance numbers. The prime minister is now in the place where he wants to reduce the numbers coming in, not just the pull factors.'

Pressure has mounted on the Government to promise an 'in-out' vote on whether voters wish to remain part of the union, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage urging the Cabinet to commit to hearing voters' views on the subject. 

Earlier this week the Prime Minister said he felt it was worth giving relations with Brussels 'one last go' ahead of the crucial Rochester and Strood by-election, where Tory contenders are fighting Ukip defector Mark Reckless for the seat.
