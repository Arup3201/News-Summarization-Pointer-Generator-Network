A family has been forced out of their charred home after their 5-year-old son started a fire after playing with a lighter.

Amoz Davis was in his bunk bed when he started playing with the lighter on Thursday night in northern Miami apartment.

The 5-year-old's dangerous game sparked a massive fire that spread throughout their apartment.

Burned: The apartment in northern Miami was covered in soot and ash Friday morning after the fire the night before

Fire-starter: Amoz Davis, 5, was playing with a lighter when the blaze started

'I had a fire and I light the bed up and then all the stuff get on fire,' he told NBC Miami on Friday morning.

The home was left in cinders, barely recognizable and covered in black soot with furniture and all of their belongings completely ruined.

Their neighbor reportedly realized what was going on and tried to help with a fire extinguisher but his efforts proved fruitless.

'When I get right to the door, it was too hot to get in. The fire was too hot,' Arthur Lewis said.

Surveying the damage: Amoz and an unidentified male look at the apartment hours after escaping

Another neighbor got so concerned by the smoke that she feared it would spread so he fled too.

'I was in the bathroom, and I listen to a knock on our door, so I opened the door, and I saw there was a lot of smoke,' Laika Bukhari told local station WVSN.

'My car was right there. I took my children, and I came here. That's it. I left everything.'

What remains: Friends and neighbors tried to help but the fire was too strong

Positive: Amoz's mother said that she was just happy that everyone was able to get out alive

First responders from the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue squad arrived at 8.30pm but they could not do much either.

The Davises had to be evacuated and spent the night elsewhere, but Amoz's mother Christy is keeping a positive attitude.

'Everybody's okay, I'm just glad that we're alive,' she told NBC Miami.

'Don't leave lighters around your kids 'cause it's very dangerous.'
