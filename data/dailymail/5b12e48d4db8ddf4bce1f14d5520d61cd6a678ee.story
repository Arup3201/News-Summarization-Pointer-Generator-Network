Warning: Marta Andreasen will appear in Eastleigh alongside Cabinet ministers as she becomes the most prominent figure to leave Ukip and join the Conservatives

Voting for UKIP risks handing Nick Clegg a crucial by-election win this week, the Tories will warn today.

Defecting Euro MP Marta Andreasen will appear in Eastleigh alongside Cabinet ministers including Michael Gove and Patrick McLoughlin as she becomes the most prominent figure to leave UKIP and join the Conservatives.

She told the Daily Mail that the ‘cold reality’ was a ‘vote for UKIP in Eastleigh is simply a vote to give Nick Clegg another pro-Euro MP’.

The Liberal Democrats last night slumped to their lowest-ever poll rating in the wake of the sexual harassment allegations against their former chief executive Lord Rennard.

A ComRes survey for The Independent put the party on just eight per cent, in fourth place behind UKIP for the first time.

However, a separate survey by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft suggested that in the Hampshire seat of Eastleigh, where voters go the polls on Thursday, the Lib Dems are clinging on to a five-point lead over their coalition partners.

The Eastleigh by-election, triggered by the resignation from Parliament of the disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, has become a high-stakes battle for David Cameron and Mr Clegg.

Defeat to the Tories in what has been a traditional stronghold would be a shattering blow for the Deputy Prime Minister and mark the first time a prime minister has taken a seat in a by-election since Margaret Thatcher in her Falklands pomp in 1982.

While a ComRes poll shows the Lib Dems down to just 8 per cent nationally, a separate survey by Lord Ashcroft puts the party five points ahead in the Eastleigh by-election

But Mr Cameron will face questions 
about his own chances of securing a majority in 2015 if the 
Conservatives fail to take the constituency against the backdrop of Mr 
Huhne’s resignation and the deepening scandal over the allegations 
against Lord Rennard.

Mrs Andreasen, who was UKIP MEP for 
the south-east region and the party’s only female representative in 
Brussels, said she had been persuaded to join the Tories by Mr Cameron’s
pledge of an EU referendum last month.

She said Ukip supporters were ‘good 
people’ but launched an attack on the party’s leader Nigel Farage for 
failing to stand in Eastleigh, instead selecting a little-known 
councillor from Surrey.

‘The fact that Nigel Farage ducked-out
of fighting the Eastleigh by-election made it crystal clear to me that UKIP just isn’t serious about offering real leadership,’ she said.

‘It was a golden opportunity to try 
and return an MP to Westminster and he shirked it. Selecting a relative 
nobody underlined what I had started to fear for some time: that UKIP is
a pressure group with no real political ambitions or aspirations.

‘In this context I have to ask what do you get if you vote UKIP? We have a perfect answer this week in the Eastleigh by-election.

‘Only two parties have a real chance 
of winning in Eastleigh - the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives. 
That’s the party that wants to take us into the Euro or the party that 
wants to give us an in/out referendum.

‘UKIP cannot win, but it could still 
affect the result - UKIP votes could help the pro-EU Liberal Democrats 
get in. A vote for UKIP in Eastleigh is simply a vote to give Nick Clegg
another pro-Euro MP. That is the cold reality of a UKIP  vote.’

Mrs Andreasen said the Tory candidate 
in Eastleigh, Maria Hutchings, was a ‘eurosceptic like me’ who ‘really 
cares about her community’.

‘She will stand square behind David 
Cameron in fighting for a better deal for Britain in Europe. She is the 
candidate for a party with serious plans to cap immigration. We need her
and more of her calibre in Westminster,’ she added.

Lord Ashcroft’s poll in Eastleigh 
suggests UKIP could indeed cost the Tories the seat - putting them on 21
per cent, with the Tories on 28 per cent and the Lib Dems on 33 per 
cent.

It found that Mr Cameron and 
Chancellor George Osborne retain a clear lead over Ed Miliband and Ed 
Balls when it comes to trust on the economy, but the Lib Dems are well 
ahead of the other parties on ‘understanding the Eastleigh constituency 
and representing local people in parliament’.

Two thirds of voters in the 
constituency - including two thirds of Lib Dems - are either satisfied 
with Mr Cameron’s performance as Prime Minister or would prefer him to 
Mr Miliband.

'UKIP cannot win, but it could still affect the result - UKIP votes could help the pro-EU Liberal Democrats get in. A vote for UKIP in Eastleigh is simply a vote to give Nick Clegg another pro-Euro MP. That is the cold reality of a UKIP vote'

Lord Ashcroft said undecided voters 
could ‘yet produce a surprise’ in Thursday’s by-election, but added: 
‘With two days to go, the Liberal Democrats have the edge.’

Mr Clegg, on a flying visit to the 
constituency yesterday, accused the Conservatives of ‘breathtaking’ 
opportunism over their campaign in Eastleigh.

The Tories have produced posters 
criticising Lib Dem candidate Mike Thornton for backing a housing 
development on greenfield land in the constituency.

‘I flatly reject the cynicism, the 
opportunism, it’s really breath-taking from the Conservatives, who have 
no plan to protect green spaces elsewhere, no plan to provide affordable
homes’, Mr Clegg told BBC Radio Solent.

The Deputy Prime Minister also 
reiterated his criticism of Tory opposition to a ‘mansion tax’ on 
expensive properties, insisting: ‘We believe in fairer taxes, the 
Conservatives don’t.’
