It is the kind of eagle-eyed observation of which even Sherlock Holmes would have been proud.

Indeed, while the super-sleuth was busy solving his latest mystery on screen, armchair fans appeared more interested in deciphering some elementary errors in the New Year's Day episode of the hit BBC drama.

Nearly ten million viewers – the show's biggest audience – tuned in to find out how Benedict Cumberbatch's character had survived his rooftop plunge at the end of the previous series.

Riddle: The latest episode of Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes, had many viewers puzzled by a series of impossible journeys on the London Underground

It was one of the most eagerly 
anticipated shows of the festive period and –according to social media 
analyst  SecondSync – generated more than 300,000 tweets.

In
 the opening sequence, viewers  desperate to know how the detective had 
faked his own death saw Holmes attached to a bungee rope and springing 
back up the side of the building, while his assistant Dr Watson was  
hypnotised by illusionist Derren Brown in the street below.

A
 latex mask of Sherlock was then placed over the body of villain 
Moriarty, giving Holmes time to make his exit. However, this was 
revealed to be only a conspiracy theory.

A second version of events was then offered that showed Holmes pushing a lookalike dummy off the building.

He is then shown giving Professor Moriarty a kiss.

Finally,
 Holmes seemingly confesses the real plot, suggesting he landed on a 
giant airbag, which was swiftly removed while he was covered in fake 
blood on the pavement by a team of helpers.

Dr
 Watson was deliberately knocked over by a bicycle, giving Holmes time 
to place a squash ball under his arm and briefly stop his pulse when the
 doctor felt his wrist for signs of life.

inexplicably passes through a succession of District and Circle Line 
stations

Curious: Watson later emerges from Euston Square station, back in the direction he had presumably just travelled from

But as well as concentrating on the storyline, thousands of viewers gleefully pointed out continuity errors.

At the start of the 90-minute show, viewers saw Martin Freeman as Dr Watson on the Tube, where he appeared to travel along three lines without switching trains.

In another segment in which Holmes and Watson are investigating a train journey made by a suspect, Sherlock concludes that the 'five-minute' journey between Westminster and St James's Park must have lasted ten minutes. In reality the one-stop journey takes less than two minutes.

The pair later investigate CCTV footage showing a man climbing aboard a Jubilee Line Train to travel one stop between Westminster to St James's Park which is on the District and Circle Lines

The man has vanished by the time the train arrives at 'St James's Park' - which commuters will recognise is NOT the District line platform at the real station... and what would a Jubilee Line train doing at a District Line station anyway?

As the pair enter Westminster station,
 which is served by the District, Circle and Jubilee lines, they are 
inexplicably shown walking past a sign for the Northern line.

Viewers
 also pointed out that the carriage, which was shown carrying just one 
passenger, would have been full of people travelling home because it was
 the last train of the evening.

One
 fan, Wayne Moraghan, wrote: 'Might have enjoyed Sherlock more if there 
weren't so many inaccurate facts about the Tube, wrong lines, wrong 
stations, wrong times!'

Lucy Burton added: 'More confused by Sherlock's 
appalling knowledge of the Tube than how he fell.'

Brainteaser: But moments later the pair are then seen making their way to a platform on the Northern Line

The crime fighters walk along a section of the Picadilly to a stationary train that has been rigged with explosives which is supposedly underneath the Houses of Parliament 

Episode two will be broadcast on Sunday, with the third and final episode next weekend.

The
 much-anticipated return of the programme, which was last shown two 
years ago, drew a peak audience of 9.7million for its first five 
minutes. It had the highest audience of the day and was way ahead of the
 7.5million viewers who saw the opening episode of the first series in 
2010.

So will writers Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss reveal all in a later episode?

A total of 9.2 million viewers tuned in to watch,  a 33.8 per cent share of the audience - Sherlock's highest ever launch. By comparison, the first ever episode had 7.1m viewers and a 28.6 per cent share.

Steven Moffat said: 'Thrilling news on 
overnight ratings for Sherlock. A tribute to the team who work so hard, 
and with such pride, on the show, and of course to the genius of Sir 
Arthur Conan Doyle.

Reaction: Dozens of viewers took to Twitter to point out the inaccuracies

'It's proof that audiences will show up if you give them what they want - though we can't throw Benedict off a roof every week.'

It beat the TV premiere of the final Harry Potter film in the New Year ratings war.

Just over five million watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2. While the updated detective pulled in just over a third of all viewers, the wizard drew one in five.

The apparently genuine explanation in Sherlock of how Holmes faked his own death did not convince a number of viewers.

The detective claimed that after falling safely on to an airbag that is quickly removed, he sets about fooling his assistant Dr Watson that he has suffered fatal injuries.

He has fake blood applied and then slips a squash ball under his arm to try to cut off the blood supply and stop the pulse in his wrist. If a ball is squeezed in the armpit, it compresses the brachial artery, stopping the blood flow to the radial artery.

He managed to fool Watson, who checked Holmes's pulse by feeling his wrist. However, one critic suggested that the plan was flawed as doctors more commonly check the carotid pulse in the neck, rather than the radial pulse in the wrist, which would have rendering Holmes' plan useless.

Medical professionals are also usually required to take several pulse readings from different areas when examining patients.

In addition, the technique of using a ball to restrict blood flow stops the pulse in only one arm. Had Watson chosen to take Holmes's pulse in his other wrist, his plan would have been exposed.
