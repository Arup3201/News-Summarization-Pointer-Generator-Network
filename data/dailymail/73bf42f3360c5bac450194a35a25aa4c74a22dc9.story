The author of a book on the McStays - the family of four who disappeared in 2010 - says drug cartels couldn't possibly be responsible for their deaths after their bodies were recently found in a shallow grave in Mexico.

'Why would they stage their car at the border, cartels don’t do that,' said Rick Baker, author of 'No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family'. 'Someone killed all four and wanted them to think the family crossed the border.'

Police confirmed yesterday that the skeletal remains found in shallow graves in the Mojave desert belong to Joseph McStay, 42, and his 45-year-old wife, Summer. The couple and their sons have not been seen since leaving their suburban California home in February 2010.

Captain Kevin Lacy, from the coroner's division, told a news conference on Friday they had also found children's remains but a positive ID had not been made. Joseph's father Patrick McStay said he believes the other bones belong to his grandsons Gianni, three, and four-year-old Joseph Jr.

The remains of four people were dug up after an off-road biker came across one grave in the remote San Bernardino County, California on Monday.

Mystery: Joseph McStay, his wife Summer and children Gianni and Joseph Jr vanished in 2010 from their suburban Californian home with little clue as to where they had gone

Two sets of bones were found in each 
of the two shallow graves, around 3ft deep, off a dirt track, close to 
Interstate 5. There are no homes in the area but it is close to the 
freeway, police said.

Police refused to say which bones were found in which grave.

The
 bones, which were relatively intact aside from some damage by wild 
animals, are believed to have been there for 'an extended period of 
time'. A forensic anthropologist working to establish the date of the

The sheriff's office revealed little today as the investigation remains in the initial stages.

Items of clothing and other evidence had been found with the bodies but details were not disclosed.

'It’s not really the outcome we were looking for,' brother Michael McStay told cameras through his tears. 'But it gives us courage to know that they’re together and they’re in a better place.'

'My family appreciates all the support and the love we’ve been shown,' he added. 'They are a loving family and I know that all of America loves the McStays.'

Call off the search: Mr and Mrs McStay's remains were confirmed today after being found in shallow graves off a Californian interstate. The remains of two children were found with them but have not yet been identified

There
 have been suggestions that the deaths could be cartel-related after the
 bodies were found close to the Mexican border and the family's car 
abandoned close to a border crossing in 2010. 

But on Friday San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said, 'It’s too early to

tell if it’s cartel-related or any other suspects.'

The scene is being processed to see if DNA other than the family's is present.

On Thursday before he had official confirmation, Patrick McStay told the LA Times: 'I got a cold chill and I knew it was them.'

The bones were found on Monday morning between Quarry and Stoddard Wells roads, just north of Victorville.

In April this year, the FBI took over the search for the family after they vanished without a trace from their suburban California home.

Detectives
 with the San Diego County Sheriff's office had said most signs point to the 
McStay family crossing the border into Mexico after they were last seen 
February 4, 2010.

A motorcyclist came across the bones in a shallow grave in the California desert on Monday. Bones belonging to three others were found in graves nearby

Investigators search the scrubland in the remote California desert for more clues about who the remains belong to

Joseph McStay and wife Summer went missing along with his wife and two children in 2010 from their San Diego County home. Bones found today were confirmed as belonging to the couple

The family of Joseph and Summer McStay insist that they did not leave the U.S. with their sons of their own free will.

The case - a quiet suburban family inexplicably 
vanishing from their Fallbrook home without a word of goodbye - has baffled everyone involved.

'Due to the fact that the family is 
believed to be out of the country, and because minor children are 
involved, the primary investigative responsibility for the case is being
 transferred to the FBI,' Lieutenant Glenn Giannantonio of the sheriff's
 department said in a statement in April.

Bones were found in the desert and police are expected to make an announcement later today with further details about who they belong to

Human remains found in the San Bernardino County desert may belong to four members of a San Diego family that has been missing since 2010

Authorities believed they spotted the 
McStay family crossing by foot into Mexico on surveillance camera video 
at the San Ysidro customs stop, just south of San Diego, on February 8, 
2010.

Their SUV was found abandoned in San Ysidro the same day. The family has no known ties to Mexico.

Someone also made online searches about Mexican border crossings days on the family computer days before the McStays vanished. 

Since they vanished, the family have 
not used their cell phones, credit cards or touched the $100,000 in 
their bank accounts.

When 
police searched their house they found a carton of eggs on the counter, 
two bowls of popcorn on the futon and two dogs in the backyard, 
suggesting the family may have left in a hurry. Their dogs had been left
 without food or water.

Inside their two-story house detectives found no sign of foul play, just evidence of everyday life.

Earlier this year, claims in an explosive, self-published book by an amateur sleuth revealed that Mrs McStay sent abusive emails to her husband in which she vowed: 'I will turn on you'.

In ‘No Goodbyes: The Mysterious Disappearance of the McStay Family’, former radio show host Rick Baker argues that Joseph and Summer’s marriage was ‘doomed from the start’ and that she may have murdered her husband.

Baker made the shocking allegations after conducting dozens of interviews over three years with friends and members of the McStay family.

Baker became ‘obsessed’ with the case and has turned up hundreds of text messages and emails he claims have led him to believe that the seemingly-loving wife was living a double life.

He told MailOnline in January that the emails depict Summer as a ‘sick monster’ who plotted against her husband’s son from a previous marriage because she ‘hated him’.

Reached by phone at the time the book was published, Joseph's brother Mike McStay told MailOnline: ‘The family have no comment’.

But he has in the past spoken to CNN and condemned Baker's book. Of Baker himself, he said: 'I don't know how he sleeps at night. I suspect he's looking for money. He's a good manipulator and knows how to twist things. He's just trying to sell books.'

Mike and Joseph's mother Blake added: 'It was very hard to read all this, very heartbreaking, the accusations. The bottom line for me is this book will bring focus to finding the family.'

Possible lead: Police initially thought this family (circled) seen crossing the border into Mexico were the McStays

Odd: The family left their dogs behind in their home as well without food or water, which puzzled investigators
