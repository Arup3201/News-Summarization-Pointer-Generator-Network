The  leader of the Muslim group who defended ISIS executioner Mohammed Emwazi  has sparked further outrage after he refused to condemn the stoning women.

Asim Qureshi, the director of Cage, was last night quizzed about extremist positions advocated by Muslim scholars - including female genital mutilation, domestic violence and stoning as a punishment for adultery.

But Mr Qureshi, appearing on the BBC's This Week programme, failed to speak out against the practices - while also defending the right of Muslims to wage jihad. 

It comes after he defended the London-raised fanatic Emwazi - unmasked as the infamous fanatic 'Jihadi John' - as a 'beautiful, kind man'.

Asim Qureshi, the hard-line leader of the Muslim rights group Cage, which defended ISIS executioner Jihadi John last week, has sparked further outrage after repeatedly refusing to condemn the stoning women

Pressed by Andrew Neil, the show's presenter, to condemn a series of extreme positions, including claims that Jews are descended from pigs and homosexuality is evil, Mr Qureshi responded 'I'm not a theologian'

2006: 'When we see Hezbollah defeating the armies of Israel, we know where the solution is and where the victory lies.

'We know that it is incumbent upon all of us, to support the Jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West.

February 26, 2015: Mohammed Emwazi was an “extremely gentle, kind, beautiful young man'. He was “extremely kind, extremely gentle and the most humble young person I ever knew”.

March 3, 2015: 'What we want is to understand whether or not the security agencies, their actions, led to him feeling like he does not belong to UK society. That is it. We never said there is a direct causality.”

March 5, 2015: "Jihad is part of the religion of Islam."

Pressed by Andrew Neil, the show's presenter, to condemn a series of extreme positions, including claims that Jews are descended from pigs and homosexuality is evil.

He responded 'I'm not a theologian' before adding: 'I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.'

Mr Neil accused Mr Qureshi of advocating Jihad and Sharia law. Mr Qureshi responded: 'As far as I am concerned, Sharia law isn't practised correctly anywhere in the world. Jihad is part of the religion of Islam.'

He repeated his criticism of MI5 and the security services, claiming they helped to radicalise young Muslim men by mistreating them.

Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson said his remarks showed 'what we are up against in terms of the 'moderate front'.

The exchange came after London Mayor Boris Johnson accused Mr Qureshi of being an apologist for terror.

Mr Qureshi last week described London-raised fanatic Emwazi – accused of being the infamous 'Johadi John' in the ISIS beheading videos - as an 'extremely kind' and 'extremely gentle' man who had been radicalised as a result of harassment by security agencies.

The Cage research director said he believed the approach taken by the agents was 'a factor in the reason why he felt like he didn't belong in the UK any more'.

Mr Johnson responded: 'I really, really think that the focus of your indignation and outrage should be on people who go out to join groups that throw gays off cliffs, that behead people who don't subscribe to their version of Islam, that glorify in the execution of innocent journalists and aid workers.

Mr Qureshi – who last week described the British fanatic Mohammed Emwazi unmasked as Jihadi John, as a 'beautiful young man' -

'These should be the object of your wrath, not the security services who are trying to keep us safe.'

Mr Qureshi, 33, has revealed the he became 'anti-white' at the £18,000-a-year Whitgift School in Croydon, south London, which he attended as a child.

The controversial campaign chief was born in Britain to Pakistani parents and – thanks to his mother's ice-cream business – was sent to 400-year-old Whitgift.

Jihadi John's sister is 'living in fear' after receiving death threats, a close friend said today.

Student Shayma Emwazi, 23, has been tracked and abused on Facebook, forcing her to close her account.

She and the rest of Emwazi's family are now living under police protection in a secret location after Mohammed Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John.

A friend of Shayma told the Evening Standard: 'They are struggling to live a normal life.

'Shayma came back from holiday not too long ago to all of this drama which occurred overnight. She does not deserve to be blamed for her brother's evil actions.

'The only thing she and Mohammed have in common is that they are blood, but she is not a terrorist.'
