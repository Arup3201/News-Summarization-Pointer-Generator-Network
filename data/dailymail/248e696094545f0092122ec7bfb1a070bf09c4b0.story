A 26-year-old woman has been accused of kidnapping her estranged husband at gunpoint from his new girlfriend's house. 

Michelle Barker Bradley, 26, of Stanton, Alabama, fired gunshots outside the home of her husband's new girlfriend in Selma at 5am on Saturday before demanding he come outside to see her.

Ms Bradley banged on the front door and threatened she would 'shoot up' the house, according to police.

Michelle Barker Bradley, 26, of Stanton, Alabama, was charged with kidnapping this weekend after she turned up at her estranged husband's new girlfriend's home and bundled her ex into the car at gunpoint

When her husband came out of the house, Bradley said she would kill him if he didn’t get into the  car.

The 26-year-old then called her mother-in-law to say that she was going to kill her son and dump his body along the roadside.

The new girlfriend called the police after her married lover was snatched. Police began tailing Bradley's car and were able to pull her over without incident. 

A .22-caliber semi-automatic weapon was recovered from the car.

Bradley has been charged with second-degree domestic violence kidnapping, domestic violence reckless endangerment, four counts of reckless endangerment and harassment.

She is being held without bond as she awaits a court hearing. 

While the couple is still legally married, they are 'voluntarily separated'.
