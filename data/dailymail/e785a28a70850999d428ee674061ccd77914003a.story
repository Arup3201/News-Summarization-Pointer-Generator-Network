An Army general who carried on a three-year affair with a captain and had two other inappropriate relationships with subordinates was reprimanded and docked $20,000 in pay on Thursday, avoiding jail time in one of the military's most closely watched courts-martial.

Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair, the former deputy commander of the storied 82nd Airborne Division, was believed to be the highest-ranking U.S. military officer ever court-martialed on sexual assault charges, but earlier this week those charges were dropped when he pleaded guilty to inappropriate relationships with the three women.

Sinclair smiled and hugged his two lawyers in the courtroom. Outside the building in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he made a brief statement.

'The system worked. I've always been proud of my Army,' he said. 'All I want to do now is go north and hug my kids and my wife.'

The case unfolded with the Pentagon under heavy pressure to confront what it has called an epidemic of rape and other sexual misconduct in the ranks.

As part of the plea deal, Sinclair's sentence could not exceed terms in a sealed agreement between defense lawyers and military attorneys.

The agreement, unsealed on Thursday, called for Sinclair to serve no more than 18 months in jail, but the judge's punishment was much lighter.

Prosecutors did not immediately comment. Capt. Cassie L. Fowler, the military lawyer assigned to represent the accuser's interests, had a grim expression after the sentence was imposed and declined to comment.

In closing arguments, prosecutors argued Sinclair should be thrown out of the Army and lose his military benefits, while the defense said that would harm his innocent wife and children the most. The two sides also offered contrasting arguments about the seriousness of the misdeeds that felled the general.

'It's not just one mistake. Not just one lapse in judgment. It was repeated,' said prosecutor Maj. Rebecca DiMuro.Â 

'They are not mistakes. We are not in the court of criminal mistakes. These are crimes.'

The
 defense had called a host of character witnesses this week to laud 
Sinclair as a selfless leader in hopes of getting a lenient punishment.

Defense attorney Richard Scheff said Sinclair will retire from the military.

'He has new mountains to climb,' he said.

Scheff said the case against Sinclair was one of pure adultery, which is a crime in the military.

'People ought to be encouraged to come forward and the right cases brought. This was not the right case,' Scheff said.

Prosecutors
 did not ask the judge to send Sinclair to jail, even though the maximum
 penalty he faced on the charges to which he pleaded guilty was more 
than 20 years.

The judge 
could have also dismissed Sinclair from the Army, which would have 
likely wiped out his Veterans Administration health care and military 
retirement benefits.

The 
general also pleaded guilty to adultery and using his government-issued 
credit card to pay for trips to see his mistress and other conduct 
unbecoming an officer.

Sinclair had been accused of twice forcing the female captain to perform oral sex during their affair.

The
 Army's case against Sinclair started to crumble as questions arose 
about his primary accuser's credibility and whether military officials 
improperly rejected a previous plea deal because of political concerns.

A
 military lawyer representing Sinclair argued that his wife, Rebecca, 
had made a significant investment in the Army herself by holding 
leadership positions in organizations that helped soldiers' families. 
Maj. Sean Foster said Rebecca Sinclair and the couple's two sons would 
be hurt the most if the general lost benefits.

'These three are the only truly innocent people in this case,' he said.

Sinclair's wife has not been present during the court proceedings and was not there on Thursday.

Sinclair broke down in tears multiple times during Wednesday's hearing.

When
 a letter from his wife was read aloud, Sinclair buried his head in his 
hands, appeared to cry and dabbed his eyes with two tissues.

In
 the letter, Rebecca Sinclair said she hasn't fully forgiven her husband
 but doesn't want the Army to punish him and his family further with a 
significant reduction to his pension and other benefits.

'Believe
 me when I tell you that the public humiliation and vilification he has 
endured are nothing compared to the private suffering and guilt that he 
lives with every day,' wrote Rebecca Sinclair, who hasn't attended her 
husband's hearings.

Jeffrey 
Sinclair also broke down at several points as he read a statement to the
 judge, pausing to collect himself. He apologized to his family and the 
women with whom he admitted inappropriate relationships.

'I've
 been frustrated and angry, but I don't have to look any further than 
the mirror for someone to blame,' he said, noting the hearing came 
exactly two years after the captain came forward with allegations on 
March 19, 2012.
