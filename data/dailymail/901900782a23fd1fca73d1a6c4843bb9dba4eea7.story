He stepped out of a chauffeur-driven Range Rover, trotted up a flight of steps, slapped a circle of newly-installed Ukip MEPs firmly on the back, and asked the night’s big question: ‘Right then, where’s the bar?’

Nigel Farage breezed into Southampton’s historic Guildhall to meet the supporters who have devoted recent months to engineering a stunning election victory that has re-drawn Britain’s political map.

First, though, he had to navigate his way through a sea of newspaper and TV crews who had descended from across Europe, blocking the entrance to the hall where votes had just been tallied.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage, at the South East count in Southampton, hailed his party's victory as the most extraordinary result in British politics for 100 years

‘How happy are you?’ asked a sharp-elbowed German TV presenter, thrusting a microphone into his mouth. ‘I’ll be very happy,’ Farage replied, ‘once this part of the night is all over, and I can get to our private party.’

But first: business. Three nights after he declared a ‘political earthquake’ and announced that ‘the Ukip fox is in Westminster’s hen house’, Farage was once more eager to sing the praises of what he likes to call his ‘people’s army’.

‘We formed our people’s army to take on the establishment, and it looks like we’ve won a great  victory,’ he said. ‘But we’re getting used to this. And you know what? I quite like it!’

There was indeed a practised air to the way Farage celebrated his success. He had begun the evening at what an aide described as a ‘modest but serviceable’ local hotel, dining on steak sandwich topped with a healthy dollop of mustard ‘English, not French’.

The Ukip leader’s German wife, Kirsten, was then dispatched to the count early, clutching a bag bursting with miniature bottles of pink champagne to hand to supporters.

By the time Farage arrived, in a grey pinstripe suit, the warmth of the mood could be gauged from regular whoops of delight coming from the bar, where a TV was tuned to the BBC’s results programme.

Before he could clamp his lips around the first pint of bitter, it was time to consider the effect of his victory – breaking more than a century of Liberal, Labour and Conservative electoral domination – on the political map.

Already, there are whispers in Conservative circles of a pact with Ukip at the 2015 election. And even George Osborne was on television yesterday morning discussing his newfound ‘respect’ for the party.

It’s certainly a world away from his compadre David Cameron’s now infamous 2006 aside, during a radio interview, where he declared: ‘Ukip is sort of a bunch of … fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists, mostly.’

‘After nine years of abuse, I was quite surprised,’ Farage said. ‘I nearly choked on my breakfast. But yes, he was trying to be nice I think and decided that throwing abuse at us doesn’t work. It only makes us more popular.’

As to whether a pact is on the cards, he insisted – and this is undoubtedly how results will today be spun – that Labour now has as much to fear from Ukip’s rise as the Tories. ‘Look at the results. The really big hits we’re getting are in the north of England from the Labour Party.

‘You know, actually the Conservative vote looks to me like it’s holding up quite steadily in many areas. Or more than perhaps it might have. So it’s not quite as bad a night for David Cameron as people have predicted.

‘So I wouldn’t have thought there’s any prospect of a deal with the Conservative Party. Firstly, I don’t think they’d want to offer it, and secondly, electorally, I don’t think it would make much sense for us either.

‘I think it would be extremely unlikely, is my take. The analysis is that we’ve hurt Labour. In 2009, when we came second at the last European  election, they said it was a high water mark, and that we’d never do it in a domestic election.

‘Then last year in English county elections we did. So then people tried to say it was all just a protest vote and that we would go away. Now there’s another protest vote and another high water mark.

‘Once we get this out of the way, the people’s army is off to Newark, where we have a by-election in a month.’

And who would now bet against yet another high water mark there?
