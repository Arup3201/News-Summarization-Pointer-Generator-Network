Charge: Michael Douglas McDowell has been charged with 10 years probation after falsifying a military record and being married to two women at once

A man who claimed touted his Purple Heart and wore military medals has plead guilty to impersonating a public servant.

Michael Douglas McDowell, 57, spent years living in Fort Worth, Texas pretending to be a general but he has now been sentenced to five years’ probation for the crime.

That wasn't the only deception that he is now in legal trouble for, as he has been charged with bigamy because he married one woman while still legally married to his estranged wife.

The bigamy charge led to a second five-years of probation.

'For the better part of 15 years, this defendant perfected the art of stolen valor,' Tarrant County assistant district attorney Joshua Ross said in a statement.

'The lengths to which he was willing to go were prolific; including wearing an officer’s uniform and medals, as well as obtaining purple heart license plates, none of which was earned. He even wore a uniform to his marriage to a woman who believed him to be a military officer, and who was not aware of his other marriage.

'Considering those in uniform rarely ask for anything more than an occasional ‘thank you,’ Michael McDowell’s actions are profoundly offensive.'

According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the first tip off to his fictitious personal history came when he offered the local police chief a tour of the White House or Pentagon.

Fooled: McDowell wrote a fake obituary for his father, that General David Petraeus commented on in 2011

Officer Halstead told the paper that he became suspicious because McDowell reeked of cigarette smoke and was wearing an ill-fitting suit- two things that he thought were not befitting of such a high-ranking military man- prompting him to have some of his deputies look into his background. 

During the investigation, they were led to a fake online obituary for his father, who he claimed was a Brigadier General at the time of his death but had in fact died more than two decades earlier never having served in the military.

The ruse got passed General David Petraeus- before resigning as CIA director amid extramarital affair allegations- who posted a message on the online obituary.

Michael McDowell had completely fabricated not only his own military service record, but also his father's who died in 1985 in California and not in 2011 in Seattle as he wrote online.

That didn't stop Petraeus from offering his condolences to Michael and his then-fiancée Christy.

'General McDowell was a great man and leader, and I am confident that you will accomplish even more than he did in his lifetime,' Petraeus wrote of the deceased.

'Thank you for your devout and faithful service to your country and for being a great man that leads by example.'
