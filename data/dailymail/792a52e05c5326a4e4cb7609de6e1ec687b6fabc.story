Three years after a Florida jury found Casey Anthony not guilty of murdering her two-year-old daughter, she has become a prisoner in her own home.

During the two-month trial into the death of her daughter, Caylee, whose skeletal remains were found in woodland five months after she disappeared, Anthony became America's most hated woman.

In an exclusive interview with lawyer Cheney Mason, who worked on her case, CNN has revealed how despite being cleared of wrongdoing, Anthony is too scared to go outside.

Bond: Florida lawyer Cheney Mason sits with Casey Anthony during her trial over the death of her two-year-old daughter Caylee

Outrage: Although she was aquitted Anthony rarely leaves her house because of the hatred towards her

Mason, a top Florida lawyer, became involved with Anthony's case in response to local media of her attorney, Jose Baez.

During the trial, Mason befriended Anthony and he and the legal team have since become the closest the young woman has to family.

Since the trial, Anthony has had no contact with her father, George, who was accused by the defense team of abusing her as a child, and she speaks infrequently with her mother, Cindy.

She 'does not have any blood family anymore,' said Mason, who has written a book, Justice in America.

His wife, Shirley, said: 'I'm a cross between a friend, a mother,
 but not a mother - only someone who is older who has had experience in
 the world she has not had.'

On the opening day of her trial, her defense attorney Baez opened his statement by accusing Anthony's father of molesting her.

Mr Anthony denied the accusation, which shocked everyone in the courtroom, including Mason.

June 15, 2008 Casey Anthony claims this was the last day she saw her two-year-old daughter, Caylee.

July 15, 2008 Anthony's mother, Cindy, calls 911 to say she has found out her grandchild has been been missing for one month.

In one of three 911 calls, Cindy Anthony said: 'I found my daughter's car today and it smelled like there's been a dead body in the damn car.'

July 16, 2008 Anthony claims she had left her child with a babysitter.

July 22, 2008 Forensic detectives find a strand of Caylee's hair in the boot of the car, and cadaver dogs indicate a body had been in it.

By this point Anthony had been declared a person of interest. 

October 14, 2008 Anthony is charged with  first-degree murder. Casey was also charged with aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter and providing false information to law enforcement.

December 11, 2008 Skeletal remains are found in woodland close to the family home. DNA tests later confirm that it is Caylee.

An autopsy could not determine the cause of death, but showed the toddler's head had been wrapped in duct tape from the chin to the nose.

May 25, 2011 The trial begins, with a statement from Anthony's defense team that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family pool, and she and her father had panicked and tried to cover it up.

July 5, 2011 Anthony is found not guilty of murdering her daughter.

Anthony was acquitted by a jury of murder, child abuse and manslaughter of a child.

She was convicted for four minor charges relating to giving false information to police.

But despite being cleared of killing her child, Anthony is unable to live like a free woman.'

'She has to live constantly on guard. She can't go out in public,' Mason told CNN.

'She hasn't 
been freed from her incarceration yet cause she can't go out. She can't
 go to a beauty parlor, she can't go shopping to a department store, she
 can't go to a restaurant, she can't even go to McDonald's. She can't do
 anything,' he said.

Anthony is living at an undisclosed location because of continued threats made her against her, and the level of public hatred for the woman.

Mason said the trial, which he worked at pro bono, had cost him more than a million dollars in unpaid hours.

He had agreed to help with the case after meeting Anthony in police cells, and seeing how scared and frail she was.

He praised the young woman's strength later on in the trial, which could have carried the death penalty, when she refused to take part in a plea deal.

'Casey got
 very angry about that. She got very angry to hear talk about it. She 
didn't want to hear it.

'Casey would fight it 'til her last
 breath. She didn't kill her daughter,' he said.

Mason said that since the trial Anthony was working hard to have a normal life, and is still upset at losing her daughter.

'I know
 she has very strong feelings for what has happened to her.

'I also know 
she's very saddened by her loss and she will never forget her daughter 
Caylee, ever,' he said.
