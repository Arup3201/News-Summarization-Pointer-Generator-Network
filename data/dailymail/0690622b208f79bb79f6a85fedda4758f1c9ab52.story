A nursing student dubbed 'the world's sexiest criminal' has apologized for her crime spree after agreeing to plead guilty to a string of charges that could see her locked away for years.

Stéphanie Beaudoin, 21, appeared in court today in Victoriaville, Quebec, to face accusations of 114 separate crimes, including theft and illegally possessing a stash of nine guns.

But the striking defendant - who became a viral sensation when pictures emerged after she was first accused - now says she's seen the error of her ways, and is prepared for her punishment.

Smouldering before court: Stéphanie Beaudoin, 21, agreed to plead guilty to around 30 counts of theft and firearms possession at a courthouse today in Victoriaville, Quebec

Sensation: Beaudoin became a viral sensation after her social media pictures convinced internet users to dub her the 'world's sexiest criminal'

Her lawyers today said she is prepared to enter guilty pleas to around 30 of the accusations in a plea deal which will see Canadian prosecutors drop the rest of the charges. 

In front of news crews at the courthouse today, French-speaking Beaudoin said: 'Yes, I regret my actions.

She told La Nouvelle Union: 'I acted on a whim, and at a bad time. I'm suffering the consequences now, which is the right thing, too.'

Although the act charges she will eventually face is unclear, prosecution lawyers have said time behind bars is likely when she next comes to court, on December 9.

Prison? Beaudoin, left with a friend, could be imprisoned following her guilty plea - with the most extreme sentence being life behind bars

Apology: Beaudoin said that she is sorry for her crimes, and is prepared for whatever punishment she gets

Legal issues: Beaudoin, pictured above with her lawyer Denis Lavigne, is due back in court next month

The maximum possible sentence is life in prison.

Canadian authorities believe Beaudoin worked with three underage accomplices - ages 13, 15 and 17 - to burgle residence in the Athabaska and Maple areas.

The young accomplices are being processed by Canadian youth courts.

The nursing student and her cohorts allegedly broke into the homes using the back door or basement windows.  

Viral sensation: Beaudoin, pictured left in a bikini and right with a gun, gained a significant fanbase after the accusation against her - and her pictures - came to light

History of depression: Beaudoin's lawyer said she was going through a difficult time when she committed her crimes

She faces charges of breaking and entering, receiving stolen property, as well as illegally owning and storing a cache of nine firearms.

Police found the guns in the back of Beaudoin's white Mitsubishi Lancer.

Her lawyer, Denis Lavigne, said: 'I think, with the available information, that she did what she did after a period of depression, which made itself felt.'

A pre-sentencing report has been ordered which will give more insight into her state of mind during the crimes.

Beaudoin is just the latest in a series of extremely attractive convicts to captivate the internet.

First there was Meagan McCullough, a Florida mother who was arrested in July 2010 after a DUI.

Her resulting tearful mugshot in an orange jumpsuit spurned several memes including one thatsaid 'I guess it's true...looks do kill'.

Earlier this summer another mugshot was released, showing the ex-convict Jeremy Meeks after his arrest for felony firearm possession in Stockton, California.

Meeks's smoldering looks and steel-blue eyes made him a national sensation.

In June, Meeks' lawyer told MailOnline that his client was in talks with top fashion designers to dress him for his trial. 

Reports that he was offered a $30,000 modeling contract were ultimately unfounded, his talent manager said.
