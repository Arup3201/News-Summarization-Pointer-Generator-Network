Diego offered to Arsenal as Gunners look to challenge for top spot next season

Manchester City are chasing Marcus Rashford, the 16-year-old rising star at neighbours Manchester United.

The attacking midfielder is one of the most highly sought after talents for his age group but United have yet to wrap up terms on a new contract.

City are particularly keen while Chelsea and Arsenal also have an interest. 

United are reluctant to pay out big-money
 contracts and constantly risk losing some players due to greater 
financial incentives being offered at other clubs.

Although many would argue United's principled stance is to be admired, the harsh reality is many of the youngsters or their representatives will be swayed by the better contracts.

Rashford is a Man United fan and is still committed to the club, but that won't stop rivals from making legitimate offers.

There is a growing feeling within United that they will have to bend their past policy if they are to continue to compete.

While James Wilson is one shining light on the horizon, they are not blessed with an abundance of prospects and it is a facet of the club David Moyes wanted to address and one Louis van Gaal will do also.

The flip side is that the likes of Chelsea and Arsenal have problems when some of their young players sense they will not make any progress and want to leave.

Chelsea have an issue arising with highly-rated defender Andreas Christensen. The Denmark U21 centre half wants to play more games and other clubs, such as City, will offer the promise of a quicker route to the first team.

Manchester United are expected to place an official bid for Marco Reus at Borussia Dortmund over the coming days but may leave a move for Toni Kroos until next summer when he becomes a free agent.

His Bayern Munich team-mate Thomas Muller is also an option for Liverpool and Arsenal who have asked to be kept informed should the German champions consider selling.

Arsenal have also enquired about Mario Mandzukic and Javi Martinez and maintain interest in Southampton duo Calum Chambers and Morgan Schneiderlin, as reported in Sportsmail.

Hotting up: Manchester United are expected to bid for Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus shortly

Newcastle, Leicester, Cardiff and Derby County are all considering moves for Leeds United striker Ross McCormack this summer.

The 27-year-old scored 29 goals in an eventful season which looks set to take another twist off the pitch with Leeds owner Massimo Cellino facing a winding-up petition from Sport Capital on June 9. Other creditors are also demanding unpaid monies.

Leeds rejected offers from Cardiff and West Ham in January and will demand around £10million this window. However, the offers that come in will be around £6m and the player could ask to go if the unrest at Elland Road escalates.

Derby will only bid should they gain promotion but Leicester, who also like Brighton's Leonardo Ulloa, are keen.

Meanwhile, Newcastle are looking to sell Northern Ireland midfielder Shane Ferguson. The 22-year-old, who had a loan spell with Birmingham earlier in the season, has two years left on contract so Newcastle will look for around £1m.

Wolves, Sheffield Wednesday and St Mirren are keen on on out of contract midfielder Conor Newton.

Juventus have revived their interest in Manchester City full back Aleksandar Kolarov.

The 28-year-old is a popular figure at the Etihad but is interested in a return to Serie A where he has other suitors such as Roma and Inter Milan.

His wages of £2.9m a year are a sticking point but Italian champions Juventus are prepared to offer a longer deal on around £2.5m a year. On Wednesday, Juve officials met Kolarov's representatives at the Westin Palace Hotel in Milan and they are due to hold further talks after the weekend before making a proposal to City.

The Serbia defender has one year left on contract at City, who he joined from Lazio in 2010.

Besiktas are hopeful of persuading Gary Medel to leave Cardiff for Turkey. The Chile midfielder, who cost £11million from Sevilla last summer, has an escape clause which was triggered once Cardiff were relegated.

However, he also has admirers in the Premier League, as do team-mates Steven Caulker and Fraizer Campbell. Both are expected to leave over the coming weeks.

Stoke are among the clubs to have considered Campbell. Manager Mark Hughes is intent on bringing in another striker and has scouted Markus Berg at Panathinaikos and other targets in the Bundesliga despite being rebuffed by Ivica Olic at Wolfsburg and, so far, Mame Biram Diouf at Hannover.

Former Blackburn Rovers midfielder Radosav Petrovic is weighing up a return to the Premier League.

The 25-year-old has been playing for Genclerbirligi in Turkey but has tentative offers from four Premier League clubs, while newly-promoted Leicester City have also shown an interest.

Petrovic, who played 19 times for Blackburn in 2011-12, has been capped 37 times by Serbia.

Crystal Palace are interested in Bordeaux's 29-year-old Nicolas 
Maurice-Belay and Marseille's Thomas Ephestion, 18.

However, manager 
Tony Pulis has made left back and striker his priority positions should 
he opt to stay on at Selhurst Park.
