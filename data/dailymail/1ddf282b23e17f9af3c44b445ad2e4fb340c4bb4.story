Dozens of football fans were injured in a crush at Hillsborough eight years before the tragedy that claimed 96 lives, an inquest heard yesterday.

Jurors were told that the sequence of events was similar to that which took place in the later, fatal incident.

The first crush came during an FA Cup semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1981.

A video played at the inquest into the death of 96 Liverpool fans at 
Hillsborough showed a near-fatal crush which took place during a FA Cup semi-final in 1981 -
 eight years before the fatal disaster

Minutes after kick-off, more than 200
 Tottenham fans had to be helped to safety after the crowd on the 
Leppings Lane terrace surged forward to celebrate the opening goal.

Jurors
 examining the cause of the fatal crush at the same stadium eight years 
later, in another semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, 
were shown a video clip from the earlier game.

After
 Spurs striker Steve Archibald scored four minutes into the match, Spurs
 supporters could be seen climbing over a fence, assisted by police 
officers who also opened two gates.

With
 nine minutes on the clock, a considerable number of fans had spilled 
over from the terraces and sat behind the goal; a St John Ambulance 
worker was even captured on video carrying a stretcher to assist a 
stricken spectator.

Up to 
250 Spurs fans were eventually moved to another part of Hillsborough. 
The inquest heard that 38 received injuries, including two victims with 
broken arms and one with a broken leg.

Christina Lambert QC, counsel for
 the inquest in Warrington, Cheshire, said  huge crowds had built up 
outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles shortly before the match kicked 
off, possibly because fans had been delayed by an accident on the 
motorway.

Jurors heard 38 fans were injured during the crush, which was 
started at the 
Leppings Lane end of the ground - the same stand where 96 Liverpool fans were 
killed in 1989

The crush began four minutes into the game, after a Spurs goal led to fans surging out of the stand, the inquest was told

One gate by the 
turnstiles was opened in an attempt to relieve the pressure outside, but
 it was later found that capacity may have been exceeded by some 335.

The
 sequence of events is similar to that which took place eight years 
later, the inquest heard, although the two crushes involved different 
parts of the Leppings Lane stand.

An
 investigation into the earlier incident led to concerns that the 
terrace’s capacity of 10,100 was too high, and so the stand was divided 
into three pens by fences. It was in these pens that 96 Liverpool fans 
would lose their lives in 1989.

Miss
 Lambert told the jury they would later hear from police officers who 
were on duty at both matches as well as fans, stewards and turnstile 
operators from the 1981 semi-final.

The
 inquest, which is expected to last up to a year, was ordered after 
verdicts of accidental death handed down in 1991 were quashed following 
publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel’s inquiry in 2012.
