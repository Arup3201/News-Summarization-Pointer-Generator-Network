Jurgen Klinsmann showed his stuttering USA side how it's done with a piece of silky skill during their 3-2 defeat against Chile on Wednesday night.

The former German star audaciously backheeled TWO footballs at the same time at Estadio El Teniente as his men twice blew a lead to lose in Rancagua.

US coach Klinsmann must be tempted to pull on his boots himself after watching his troops fail to win for the fifth game in a row.

Brek Shea smashed the Americans ahead with a fine left-footed strike, only for Roberto Gutierrez to haul the hosts level.

Former Sunderland frontman Jozy Altidore restored the visitors' lead with a neat finish, but Chile fought back again through Mark Gonzalez. 

The ex-Liverpool man landed the decisive blow when he rifled the ball past Nick Rimando after the USA goalkeeper parried the ball into his path.
