The five Olympic boxers from Cameroon who ‘vanished’ three weeks ago have reappeared at a South London gym for a sparring session.

The boxers disappeared from the Olympic village with a swimmer and a footballer after being beaten in their bouts during the Games.

It was confirmed on August 7 that the team had gone AWOL by David Ojong, Cameroon’s Olympics chief and had not returned home with the rest the athletes.

It was feared they were staying below the radar in the UK in a bid to secure permanent asylum once their Olympic accreditation had expired.

However, the temptation of punchbags, dumbbells and medicine balls, was too much and the gym-goers blew their cover by turning up at a boxing gym in New Cross, South London.

On Monday, the five boxers - Thomas Essomba, 24, Christian Donfack Adjoufack, 28, Yhyacinthe Mewoli Abdon, 26, Blaise Yepmou Mendouo, 27 and Serge Ambomo, 26 - showed up at the Double Jab Boxing Club in New Cross, South London.

The Cameroon boxers failed to resist the lure of laying into a punchbag

It is alleged the group showed up and asked for a training session with coach Patrick Harris, after hearing he was a ‘top coach’.

Jim Addis, an assistant coach at the boxing club, said this week: 'We were all completely gobsmacked when they turned up.

'We knew they had gone missing, but were dumbfounded when we realised who they were.

'They knew Patrick and asked especially for him and they all took part in sparring sessions.'

Mr Addis said that as news spread of the team's appearance the gym became increasingly busy with regulars.

He added: 'It was amazing - the gym was packed and the atmosphere was superb and was one of the best nights we have had here.

'It’s a great honour to have them in the gym and we are all over the moon - they have even asked to come back for more training.”

The five boxers claimed they were ‘currently living in Lewisham’, with Mr Addis adding: 'They told me they wanted to stay here and were very keen to come back to the club.

'We all want to help them as much as we can and understand they will be applying to stay here in the UK.'

Under Olympic accreditation rules the boxers can stay in the UK until November, but will then have to apply for permission to remain in the country.

Two other Cameroon athletes also vanished at the same time as the boxers - Drusille Ngako Tchimi, 25, a stand-by goalkeeper for Cameroon’s women’s team, and swimmer Paul Ekane Edingue, 21, who are both still missing

Jackie Brock-Doyle, organiser Locog’s director of communications, said after the seven athletes went missing: 'They have been reported as missing but they have visas to stay in this country until November, so right now they haven’t done anything wrong.

'We are in quite a difficult position at the moment because they are able to be in this country, they are able to do what they like in this country, obviously within reason, but until that changes it is quite difficult.'

The boxers fled from the Olympic Village after being beaten in their fights

The disappearances are not the first time Cameroonian athletes have gone missing during international sports competitions.At past Francophonie and Commonwealth games events, as well as at junior soccer competitions, several Cameroonians have quit their delegation without official consent.
