It may sound nuts, but a Cornish pasty company has today revealed that grey squirrel meat is its latest tasty filling on offer.

The sisters who own Cornish Food Box company in Truro, Cornwall, insist the woodland creatures are the ultimate in free-range, sustainable meat because of their diets.

The nuts and berries the animals eat - and a life of scampering up and down trees - makes them a tasty and healthy alternative to more traditional cuts of beef, chicken or pork, according to the company.

They have announced the £2.95 for a ready-to-cook squirrel that will feed a family of four, and remark they are good value when compared to chicken or beef.

Co-owner Lucy Jones said the response from customers at the shop had been positive.

She told MailOnline: 'We just sell local food - food from Cornwall - and a customer asked up whether we could get grey squirrel meat, so we spoke to our game supplier, and he said it would be no problem.

'The customer who asked for the meat wanted to make grey squirrel pasties. And so we sold the squirrel meat and she made the pasties.

'At a time when people are looking closely at food miles and ethics, grey squirrel is the ultimate in environmentally sustainable meat.

'It's very local and it's very free-range.

'There's the whole thing about Squirrel Nutkin, but that's about red squirrels, not greys.

'Some people say they're cute but if you're willing to eat lamb then why not squirrel?'

Ms Jones, a vegetarian who shares the business with her sister, continued: 'I think squirrel is more popular as a meat these days, and I think people are more willing to try new things, and other meats out there.

'We think it is good if people think beyond eating just pork and lamb.'

Grey squirrels have been introduced to the UK over the past two centuries and are now thought to outnumber the native population of red squirrels by about 70 to 1.

The company is donating any profits made from the squirrel sales to the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, which works to ensure the conservation and protection of the red squirrel in the United Kingdom.

Keen baker Nicki Foley suggested putting squirrel into a classic pasty to encourage people to try the delicacy.

She left the squirrel chunks to simmer on a low heat with juniper berries and then wrapped the meat in bacon for the pasty filling.

'You don't need a lot of it because it's very strong in flavour,' she said.

'One squirrel would be perfect for a family to have a stew or a curry.'
