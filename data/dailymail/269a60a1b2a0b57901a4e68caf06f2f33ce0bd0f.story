Manchester City remain locked in discussions with the Premier League as the clock ticks down on their attempts to secure Frank Lampard's availability for the New Years Day match at home to Sunderland.

Sportsmail understands that the situation remains 'live and complex' and despite Manchester City's optimism that an agreement can be struck, issues remain that must be resolved with the Premier League.

Lampard's short-term deal at Manchester City expires on December 31 and in order to ensure that he is not ineligible to play against Sunderland, the club must reach an agreement with New York City FC and ratify the movement with the Premier League.

It is understood that if a Premier League club wishes to amend an existing contract of a player - as City wish to do with Lampard - then they require the permission of the Barclays Premier League board. This is the process that is continuing late into the afternoon.

It is believed that City have written to the Premier League to attempt to find a solution. City are understood to have agreed a deal with their sister outfit in New York that will allow them to renew Lampard's loan but the length of that deal remains unknown. One suggestion is that he will sign a deal until the end of the season but it will include a break clause that would allow him to return to New York for the beginning of the MLS season in March, should all parties agree to it.

Although the transfer window does not open until January 3, Lampard's registration is not in doubt as the timespan for registering players goes from transfer window to transfer window, rather than being defined by the length of a player's contract.

However, in order to play against Sunderland on New Years Day, he must have his contract at Manchester City amended and that necessitates approval from the Premier League board. This is still to be granted by the governing body but talks are ongoing.

On Wednesday lunchtime, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini remained hopeful of a positive outcome.

'As things stands, he is in the squad list today but tomorrow [is not finalised].' Pellegrini said. 'We hope that he will be here until the end of the season. When all the things on Frank is clear, we can talk more.'Â
