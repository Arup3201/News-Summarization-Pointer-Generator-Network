Stuart Peace believes the strongest possible England U21 side should contest the Euro 2015 tournament next summer if the senior side are to have a successful future. 

The former U21 manager fails to see why the likes of Raheem Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers should not be among the senior players included in Gareth Southgate's squad next year, despite them being part of Roy Hodgson's senior set-up.

Pearce, now manager of Nottingham Forest, said: 'If you want a successful international side, you're going to have to make sure your best players go to tournaments, which I've said time and time again.'

Raheem Sterling is one of England's senior players that could feature for the U21 side at Euro 2015

Arsenal attacker Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is another exciting talent who is eligible to play in Czech Republic

Former England U21 boss Stuart Pearce thinks Gareth Southgate should take the strongest possible squad

He believes players gain valuable experience by participating in tournaments through each tier of the national set-up.   

'There will be a concern at football clubs, with football managers and the interest of club supporters definitely, but it's where you see the trade-off.

'For me, we've got Jamaal Lascelles in the U21 squad and if Gareth Southgate wants to take him next summer, he can go with my blessing because I think it's right and proper that they play.'

Arsenal full-back Calum Chambers could also get the call from Southgate having only recently been promoted

Asked if Sterling, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chambers should be picked as Southgate's senior players for Euro 2015, Pearce said he does not think their recent first-team duties should prevent them taking part in the Czech Republic.

'I'm not going to change my tune now. The bottom line is our best players should be going to a major tournament if they're age appropriate and available in my opinion and that doesn't change,' he explained.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger does not think dropping Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chambers to the U21 set-up would be beneficial to the players, particularly with both featuring heavily for the Gunners this season

But Arsene Wenger has questioned whether dropping players from the senior squad to the U21 set-up will have a positive influence on their progression.

'Once a guy has moved to the full national team and you put him down, he's never good,' said Wenger.

'On the selfish front for us, when a guy has played 50 games, it's better he has a good rest during the summer, but most of the time when they move down they are not completely at their quality.'
