A gang armed with sledgehammers and driving mopeds smashed their way into a Rolex store in central London and made off with designer watches worth tens of thousands of pounds.

The gang - also armed with an axe - launched their raid on the shop in Knightsbridge in front of horrified shoppers during broad daylight.

Around seven men broke into the Rolex store in the One Hyde Park building shortly after 10.35am, after arriving on the back of three mopeds and a motorbike, witnesses said, using their weapons to smash their way into the store.

Thieves armed with sledgehammers and an axe stole Rolex watches from a store in Knightsbridge, central London today

The gang - also armed with an axe - launched their raid on the shop in Knightsbridge in front of horrified shoppers during broad daylight

Around seven men broke into the Rolex store in the One Hyde Park building shortly after 10.35am, after arriving on the back of three mopeds and a motorbike, witnesses said, using their weapons to smash their way into the store

Eye-witnesses described hearing a smash similar to a car crash and also saw so much smoke that they thought the building was on fire.

It had been thought that the thieves had used smoke grenades but police confirmed that was not the case.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Smoke grenades were not used. What people could see was a security feature of the shop, where smoke is released so the thieves cannot see what they are doing.'

The store is located in an exclusive area of the capital next door to the five 
star Mandarin Oriental hotel and opposite department store Harvey 
Nichols.

One man, who works in a nearby casino but asked not to be named, said: 'My colleague told me that there were people around on motorbikes, or mopeds, and all of sudden there was a lot of smoke and some type of smashing noise.

'He said he wasn't sure what was happening, but then he saw people driving away - he didn't say how many - on motorbikes again.'

Another man who works in a Bureau De Change near to the Rolex shop, who also asked not to be named, added 'We just saw lots of smoke coming out, we hadn't heard anything.

'We were serving customers at the time, but we went and checked because we thought it was a fire at first.

'When we looked outside the police were already there.'

A number of eyewitnesses to the event turned to Twitter to share what they saw, with one describing the robbers using axes and throwing smoke grenades.

Alice Stuart said: 'Someone broke into the Rolex store in Knightsbridge. So much glass.'

It is believed that there were seven men in the gang and they stole about 10 watches from the shop's display cabinets.

One woman who works in a nearby clothes shop said she heard a noise which she thought was a car crash just before the robbery took place.

She said: 'I heard a smash, or a bang, from inside the shop, but it sounded maybe like a car had hit something or something like that.

'It wasn't until I heard police sirens in the distance I thought something may have happened, so I walked around the corner to look outside and saw smoke billowing out.

'I didn't have a clue what happened until somebody on the street told me there had been a robbery.'

The front door of the shop was smashed and at least three display cabinets at the front of the store appeared to have been ransacked.

Police confirmed that a number of watches had been stolen and that no arrests had yet been made.

Police also said that no firearms were used.

A police spokesman said: 'Flying Squad detectives are investigating a smash and grab in Knightsbridge.

'Police were called at 10.36am today to the Rolex Store in Knightsbridge to reports of a smash and grab.

'The gang approached the store on three mopeds and a motorbike. They used hammers and an axe to smash the front window before making of with a number of watches. No-one was injured during the robbery.'

'The Flying Squad are investigating. No arrests have been made. No firearms were used.'
