Tony Bellew delivered on his promise to exact revenge on Nathan Cleverly but did so with brains not brawn in Liverpool on Saturday night.

In front of a raucous home crowd, Bellew boxed his way to victory over the Welshman who faded in the second half of a fight that didn't quite live up to the hype.

There was surprise at the announcement of a split decision but despite one judge giving Cleverly the nod, Bellew deservedly took the spoils in the rematch.

The victor said: 'It's over. I'll fight anywhere, he's not a cruiserweight. It's been a long camp, 12 weeks, he was pacing himself and he looked at the belly and thought I would tire – I don’t tire at cruiserweight.'

After beating Bellew in 2011, Cleverly made three routine defences of his light-heavyweight world title, barely losing a round against uninspiring opponents.

With a fight against Bernard Hopkins seemingly further away than ever, Cleverly took an unnecessary risk by facing hard-hitting Sergey Kovalev last summer. But the gamble backfired spectacularly as the Welshman was dismantled over four brutal rounds in front of his home crowd in Cardiff.

Bellew, meanwhile, regrouped and plotted his path to a second world title shot. He was untroubled until struggling to a draw with the tricky Isaac Chilemba but won a unanimous decision in the rematch two months later. Then, 12 months ago, on his birthday on the last day of November, he fought world champion Adonis Stevenson in Quebec but was stopped in the sixth round, prompting a move to cruiserweight where he would soon be joined by Cleverly.

By now, both were promoted by Eddie Hearn and a rematch was inevitable. A three-fight plan was set and after each enjoyed two routine stoppage victories, the waiting was over.

Much has been made of Bellew's apparently superior power at cruiserweight but Cleverly was confident he had grown into the weight after adding almost two stone of muscle. 

The 27-year-old is now under the tutelage of former strength and conditioning coach Darren Wilson having split from father Vince who had guided him to his world title.

And it was he made the better start, winning the jab exchanges in the opening round as Bellew looked to land his dynamite left hook.

But the home favourite settled in the second session, forcing Cleverly back, preventing him from measuring the distance and finding his range.

And the former world champion looked uncomfortable under pressure while his own attack amounted to little more than a pawing jab.

In the fourth round, however, he slung his hands low in defiance, as if to show Bellew his power was having little effect. In the next, Cleverly appeared to settle on the back foot, outboxing and outfoxing Bellew to enjoy his best spell since the opening session. 

By the halfway stage, Cleverly appeared to be coping well with his bigger opponent as he levelled the score on my card.

And he continued to frustrate the home favourite who, despite throwing more punches, was struggling to make them count.

But his persistence paid off in round eight as he forced Cleverly to cling on in the centre of the ring. It would prove to be a turning point.

Tiredness set in and Cleverly struggled to hold off the bigger man's advances. At first he traded on the ropes, toe-to-toe, punch-for-punch. It was Bellew who edged these exchanges which grew more one-sided as the fight entered the home straight.

Three years ago, Bellew tired down the stretch but the roles were reversed as Cleverly opted to play rope-a-dope. He needed a big response going into the last two stanzas but opted to stand in the same spot against the ropes for the next two rounds. Cleverly later revealed he hurt his right hand in the second round.

At the bell it was Bellew who celebrated; Cleverly simply looked beaten.

He said: 'I said it would be a replica of the first. A split decision shows my character, he was using his natural strength - maybe we'll have a third fight one day, this is the second time I've come to Liverpool, maybe we have a third fight in Cardiff.'
