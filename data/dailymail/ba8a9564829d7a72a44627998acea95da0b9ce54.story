Chelsea football fans have allegedly been caught chanting the N-word and anti-Semitic slurs in a new race hate storm - prompting three Asian women and a black man to leave a train.

After the club’s victory over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, a man was heard to say on the London to Manchester service: ‘Paris, Paris, Paris, that’s the way we like it, a n***** on the door’.

This was a reference to the shocking incident that saw a group of Chelsea fans prevent a black man from getting onto a train on the Paris Metro last month before a Champions League game.  

The five culprits were overheard making references to another Chlesea racism scandal in Paris in February

A video of the latest incident - obtained by The Sun and broadcast by ITV London News on Thursday - was taken by a passenger on the 9.25pm train from London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly.

The clip - in which only the seats can be seen - also features someone saying ‘Tottenham are a load of Y**s’, referring to the club’s Jewish fan base, and ‘John Terry is a racist, a racist, a racist’.

Club captain Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association in October 2012 for racially abusing then QPR player Anton Ferdinand .

The passenger who shot the latest footage - with whom police have been in contact - described his journey as '90 minutes of hell', saying nobody dared to confront the supporters.

The video ends when as a man is heard warning his friend ‘somebody might be filming us’. British Transport Police said officers had received complaints from passengers on the train.  

The supporters also made references to club captain John Terry (centre)

Detective Sergeant Michael Maher said: ‘I want to hear from anyone who was on the train, particularly in coach E, around the time it reached Stoke, 10.40pm.

‘By the accounts we have received, the group were chanting insults at other passengers, and some of these insults may have been racist. We are in the process of checking CCTV.

‘But I would like to hear from any passengers who may have captured the behaviour of the group on mobile phones. Such footage could be crucial to our investigation.’

Four men were ejected by police who boarded the train, with their names and addresses taken, while another four left by choice.

And Rory Jennings, from the Chelsea Fans Channel, told ITV London: 'It's northern Chelsea fans. There's obviously some, but they should be quite easily pinpointed. 

'The club have done wonderful work with regard to stamping out racism - but it just shows you that there's further to go. These people need to be identified, banned and arrested. It's shocking.'

Chelsea are helping police with their probe - 'and their efforts to identify the individuals'

A Chelsea spokesman said: ‘We are assisting the British Transport Police with their enquiries, and their efforts to identify the individuals involved.’

Police are also investigating racist chanting at London St Pancras station after Chelsea’s match at Paris St-Germain on February 17.

They have identified all those believe to have been involved - the day after the Paris Metro incident – and they will be interviewed.

It is the second investigation into allegedly racist chanting involving Chelsea fans attending the same game last month. 

Chelsea won 2-0 in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium in north-west London on Sunday, with the goals scored by Terry and Diego Costa.

Anyone with information about last Sunday's incident on the train from Euston should contact BTP on 0800 405040, or by text, to 61016, quoting B5/PSUB of March 5, 2015.
