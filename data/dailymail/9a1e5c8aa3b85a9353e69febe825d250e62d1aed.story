Asian-Americans have very low obesity rates but are at a high risk of heart disease and diabetes because their bodies are more likely to store fat around organs

Asian-Americans may have a misguided sense of how healthy they are because medical surveys often create a misleading average BMI score by defining their ethnic group too broadly, experts have claimed.

Recent figures released by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey have been criticised for propagating a 'model minority myth' after it lumped at least ten countries in that category without regard for regional trends.

The survey classed somebody as Asian if they had descendants from Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand and Vietnam, among others.

For example, Filipino adults are 70 per cent more likely to be obese than the rest of the Asian-American population — but about one in 10 Vietnamese and Korean adults is underweight.

Scott Chan, program director for the Asian Pacific Islander Obesity Prevention Alliance, says he has encountered funding issues because of the misleading statistics and even has trouble convincing his own family to live healthier lives.

Mr Chan added: 'Combined together, it looks like we don’t have a problem, it kind of propagates that "model minority" myth — that Asians are healthier, we’re skinny, we’re fine.' 

'The attitude among 
many Asian-Americans is “I’m skinny, and I’m Asian, I should be fine — I
don’t have to worry about obesity and diabetes."'

The figures also showed that just 11 per cent of Asian-Americans are 
obese but doctors have said they are at a high risk of heart disease 
because of the way their bodies store fat.

Their bodies are more 
likely to be apple-shaped, storing fat around their waist which can lead
to it penetrating the liver, and are more likely to pack fat in between
organs.

Figures published in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that 10.8 per cent of Asians are obese, compared to 33 per cent of whites, 42 per cent of Hispanics or 48 per cent of black people.

Just 11 per cent of US Asians are obese compared with 33 per cent of whites, 42 per cent of Hispanics and 48 per cent of blacks, a survey has shown

For most people a body mass index 
(BMI) of over 25 is considered overweight, but Asian people have been 
known to develop fat-related illnesses with a BMI of just 19 - which is 
technically underweight.

Scientists also criticised the survey for using a very broad definition of Asian making the category effectively 'meaningless' (file picture)

Speaking
to NBC News, Dr. Karen Kim, a professor of medicine at the University 
of Chicago, said: 'It looks as if we don’t have a problem. But it’s a 
huge problem.

'There are huge differences where weight does not adequately reflect the realities of complications from being overweight.

'For Asians, you do not have to be overweight to get the complications for obesity.'

But
that is likely to be masking a problem in the Asian community, leading 
people to falsely believe that they are healthier than they actually 
are.

BMI is a figure calculated by comparing a person's weight and height.

A BM of less than 20 is considered underweight, 20-25 is in the normal range, 25-30 classes a person as overweight and a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.

It is still the standard method by which doctors calculate obesity, but has been discredited for being overly-simplistic, diagnosing some professional athletes as overweight.

Health experts have said that a more helpful benchmark for measuring obesity in any population may be to consider waist circumference and fat distribution, both of which are highly correlated with metabolic syndrome.
