When Australia last led an Ashes series 4-0  Sir Ian Botham was sitting alongside Sir Richard Branson in Sydney when the tycoon proposed that the original urn should stay Down Under with the victors.

Seven years later, Sky Sports pundit Botham still believes that should be the case, despite  having tipped England to win this series 5-0.

But Botham accepts that the original artefact is now too fragile to leave its home in the Lord’s museum, having last been in Australia on an exhibition tour in 2006-07 when England were whitewashed.

Master publicist Branson taking the attention before the Sydney Test had a lot to do with his Virgin airline having been the official carrier for the Ashes urn tour of Australia. Botham and Branson, who have had no cricket dealings since, had discussed the urn staying while on the same boat in Sydney harbour on New Year’s Eve.

The MCC, who were repeatedly called the MMC by Branson, regard the urn as always having been a museum piece rather than a cricket trophy.

England team director Andy Flower promised a fresh intensity in preparations for the Sydney Test after four defeats in a row. But the squad’s shambolic appearance on Wednesday gave no hint of a new dawn as England declined net practice at the SCG, preferring just a fielding stint instead.

How much yet another net session would benefit the squad at this stage of a dismal tour is debatable. But with new players coming into the team for the last Test, one would think every available opportunity to practise batting and bowling would be taken up — even if it meant arriving at the SCG at 8.30am on New Year’s Day rather than an hour later.

It was also noticeable that Paul Downton, the new managing director of England cricket, was not at the SCG on Wednesday despite being in Sydney.

Downton, who has the ultimate responsibility for England team issues, is due to sit down in the next week with England team director Andy Flower to discuss the way forward for a national side humiliated in Australia.

So it would surely have been beneficial for Downton to be present at the SCG to gauge the mood in the camp and training intensity, or lack of it, after four losses on the bounce.

At least the new England national selector James Whitaker was watching. Whitaker holds the dubious honour of having been BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew’s fag at Uppingham School, according to Aggers’ wife Emma in her daily tour blog.

Brian Moore, the BBC’s useless rugby co-commentator and writer of an unreadable newspaper sports column, has made great play of lambasting Sports Agenda’s admittedly amateurish video review of a day’s play during the fourth Test at Melbourne, done at the last minute to help out a colleague. 

This is the same Brian Moore whose Twitter dialogue yesterday included a post that read: ‘Oh, F*** off, you p**** .’  Also, Moore informed me at a William Hill Sports Book of the Year function — following some mild criticism of him — that the only reason he wasn’t going to punch my lights out was because of concern I might call the police.

Cook’s a good sport

Alastair Cook’s captaincy is under huge scrutiny with his England team in danger of an Ashes whitewash. But Cook couldn’t be faulted for his sportsmanship at Australian PM Tony Abbott’s reception for the two teams at his Sydney residence Kirribilli House.

Cook said in his speech that despite the results, ‘the hospitality we have received off the pitch has been exceptional’.

This contrasts with the view of ECB chairman Giles Clarke, who wants Hobart to replace  Brisbane as an Ashes Test venue because of the hostility that greeted England in Queensland.

There was a surprisingly friendly atmosphere between the rival teams, in part thanks to having their families there. It also helped that Colin Graves, deputy chairman of the ECB and  chairman of Yorkshire, has such a high opinion of Darren Lehmann after the Aussie coach’s 10 years playing at Headingley.
