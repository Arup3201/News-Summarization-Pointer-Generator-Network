A basketball game on a court at an LA Fitness gym descended into a mass brawl involving 10-15 people which included weight plates and barbells being thrown around.

Police were called to the incident at the gym in Roseville, Minnesota, last Sunday and arrested three adults and three juveniles.

Officers arrived and tried to gain control over two agitated groups of males who were shouting profanities at each other, according to criminal complaints.

Four males were fighting with one person on the basketball court and chased him into the fitness area, the complaints said.

‘People were actually throwing two and a half, five, 10 pound weights within the building,’ Police Lt. Lorne Rosand told WCCO.

Customers and gym staff tried to intervene and separate the groups, and the LA Fitness manager tried to defuse the situation by directing the man being chased to stay by the front desk and juice bar, the complaints said.

But the suspects began to throw weight plates, barbells and a trash can lid toward the juice bar and the male target, according to the complaints.

The LA Fitness gym in Rosewood, Minnesota, has been plagued with crime in recent years and police have already gone to 24 incidents this year

The incident started on a basketball court before it spilled out into the main exercise area

The three adults, Ali Yusuf Barre, 18, of Minneapolis; Abdirashid Yasin Duad, 18, of Minneapolis; and Mohamed Awil Suleiman, 20, of Burnsville, have been charged with disorderly conduct and participation in a riot.

One of them was taken to the local medical center for a concussion, but he was released. No one else was hurt.

The gym has been plagued with crime in recent years. Roseville police responded to 147 incidents there in 2013 and have already gone to 24 incidents this year.

Police are frustrated with that LA Fitness as their requests to put in security cameras or have guards on site have all been denied.

'They don’t want to take any proactive measures to prevent theft in the parking lot or inside,' Rosand said. 'I just hope they step up like any business in the community.'
