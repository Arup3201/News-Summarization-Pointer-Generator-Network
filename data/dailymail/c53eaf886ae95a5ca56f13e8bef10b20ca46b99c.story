Danica Patrick is not the only one paving the way for women on the NASCAR track - now the sport also has its first ever full-time female pit crew member.

Christmas Abbott, a glamorous weight lifter who runs her own CrossFit center and has worked as a defense contractor in Iraq, has earned a spot as a tire changer on a NASCAR pit crew.

The 31-year-old, 5ft 3, 115-pound athlete from Raleigh, North Carolina made her debut in February, working on driver Jennifer Jo Cobb's truck at the Daytona International Speedway.

Next she is under a full-time contract with Michael Waltrip Racing, working on Clint Bowyer's crew.

Success story: Christmas Abbott, 31, has become the first full-time pit crew member for NASCAR

Other women have featured in the Sprint Cup Series, Abbott explained, but none has ever been hired full-time for a season.

But even though she knows she stands out due to her gender, Abbott, who can dead lift 255 pounds and change two 60-pound tires in 12 seconds, told Sporting News she is doing it for the love of it.

'It's not a gender issue for me,' Abbott 
said. 'I decided to change tires 
because I liked what I did. I liked the excitement of it, the challenge 
and what it presented. That's why I pursued this sport.'

Abbott first considered working on a pit crew on the suggestion of a friend - and even though she wasn't initially taken by the idea, her first time watching a pit crew changed everything.

'I heard the noise for a gun [to remove the nut lugs] and 
that got my attention,' she said. 'And then I saw how fast they do it 
and the little orchestrated dance they do with the car and I was just 
fascinated.'

She said she had grown up watching racing but had never really considered the crews before.

'I had no idea it was that exciting and 
challenging,' she said. 'It's a highly tuned technical skill and it’s 
pretty incredible how spot-on you have to be every single time.'

But Abbott, who has a gun tattooed on her leg to remind her of the time she spent in Iraq, said she had already confidence in her abilities while working  in a military laundry center in a war zone.

She said that, there too, she was often one of the few women, but she simply got up and did her job.

She added that this time, she knows she has a much bigger audience - and her new-found fame is something she hopes will help other women work towards their dreams.

'There are more eyes on me,' she 
said. 'There are more eyes on Michael Waltrip and NASCAR now because of 
this. I think it is a positive highlight and [women] are going to be 
there sooner or later.

'I just hope I can perform to where I want to perform.'

She added to the Resigter Bee that she hopes everyone realizes the job is there for the taking if they put in enough hard work.

'There are other female drivers that I think are overlooked a lot,' she said. 'I just want there to be more attention across the board. This is a sport that anyone can get to, whether you’re male, female, Hispanic, it doesn’t matter. This is an open-door opportunity for anyone who wants to take it.'

Power: Abbott, who also runs a CrossFit center, said she hopes other women will join the sport

The Waltrip team said they were proud to welcome Abbott to their training sessions - but it was entirely due to her skills, rather than the attention it would bring to the crew.

'She is an incredible elite athlete,' co-owner Michael Waltrip said. 'She
is a competitor and when she decided to start working towards an 
over-the-wall position, we said we are the perfect place to make it 
happen.'

She now trains once or twice a day with the team.

'We expect her to excel or we wouldn't commit the position to her,' Waltrip said.
