Following the news that Duck Dynasty reality star Phil Robertson made homophobic statements, Cracker Barrel restaurants were the first to make a stance and pull his products from their country stores.

But less than 48 hours after that decision was made, the chain of restaurants was met with flurry of negative responses from customers and has since decided to restock Robertson products.

'When we made the decision to remove and evaluate certain Duck Dynasty items, we offended many of our loyal customers,' the company wrote on Facebook. 'Our intent was to avoid offending, but that's just what we've done. You flat out told us we were wrong. We listened.'

For the most part, sponsors have 
stuck behind Robertson. The shows biggest advertiser, Under Armor, stuck
 with the show after the scandal that started this week.

'People weren't shy. They wrote, called and took to social media,' Cracker Barrel spokesman Jeff Eller told ABC News.

'Cracker
 Barrel's mission is pleasing people. We operate within the ideals of 
fairness, mutual respect and equal treatment of all people. These ideals
 are the core of our corporate culture,' the company added on Facebook.

The 67-year-old had been quoted in a January 2014 edition of GQ as saying: 'It seems
 like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s
 anus.

'That’s just 
me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I 
mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not 
logical, my man. It’s just not logical.'

Managers at Cracker Barrel were concerned that customers may be offended by the comments, leading them to drop some of the products they stocked.

'We removed selected products which we were concerned might offend some of our guests while we evaluate the situation,' Cracker Barrel said in a Facebook statement.

A range of items linked to the program, such as Phil Robertson's Cajun Style Seasoning, have been marketed off the back of the show's success. It is not clear whether the items were the family's Duck Commander ranger or A&E products.

Despite initially losing a sponsor and being put on suspension by the network, Robertson has found backing from Bristol Palin, daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah.

'Everyone needs to leave Phil Robertson alone for expressing his beliefs,' she wrote on her blog.

'I hate how the LGBT community says it’s all about "love" and "equality". However, if you don’t agree with their lifestyle, they spread the most hate. It is so hypocritical it makes my stomach turn.'

According to RadarOnline, Miss Palin added: 'If I were Duck Dynasty, I would take my show to another channel.'

When Robertson's comments went public, A&E network said: 'We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson’s 
comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not 
reflected in the series Duck Dynasty.

'His personal views in no way reflect those of A&E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.

'The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely,' said the statement released to Entertainment Weekly.

However, a source at the network told EW yesterday that Phil will be featured in new episodes when the fourth season debuts in mid-January, and that they would ideally like to keep him on for a fifth season.

According to the source, the network is hoping the situation will blow over during the holiday season.

The reality show - which follows the Robertson clan running their duck-calling business in the swampland of West Monroe, Louisiana - has been a runaway success for A&E, with a Christmas special recently pulling in 9 million viewers.

The 67-year-old came under fire from gay rights group GLAAD after making the homophobic comments in the January 2014 issue of GQ magazine. He told the magazine: 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what’s wrong… Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behaviour and just morph out from there.

'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.'

Robertson, who claims to be devoutly 
Christian, also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists and prostitutes 
when he referenced a Bible quote in the magazine interview.

He
 said: 'Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the 
male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, 
the slanderers, the swindlers - they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. 
Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.'

Since
 its initial air date of March 21, 2012, Duck Dynasty has grown in the 
ratings for A&E, eventually becoming a ratings hit for the cable 
network.

On August 14, 
2013, the fourth season première nabbed 11.8 million viewers, making the
 show the most-watched nonfiction series telecast in the history of 
cable television.

The fourth season of the show begins on January 15.
