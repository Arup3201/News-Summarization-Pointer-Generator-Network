Crystal Palace have made a bid for Queens Park Rangers defender Armand Traore, as new manager Neil Warnock attempts to bolster the Eagles' defence. 

The new Palace manager is hopeful of making four additions to his squad before the transfer window closes on Monday, and the left-back is on his wishlist.

If the Traore deal goes through, it would be a reunion of sorts for the player and manager, after Warnock signed the Frenchman in 2011 when he was QPR manager.

Reunion: Neil Warnock managed Traore when he was manager of QPR, before being sacked in January 2012

Prior to joining the R's, the former Arsenal man had loan spells with Juventus and Portsmouth.

Traore, 24, has started both of Rangers league games this season, but has been part of a defence that has shipped five goals in two matches, and manager Harry Redknapp is willing to let him leave.

Redknapp said: 'Palace have made a good offer for Armand and it's up to him now if he wants to go, so we'll see what happens with that.' 

New boss:  Warnock was confirmed as the new Crystal Palace boss on Thursday after leaving the club in 2010
