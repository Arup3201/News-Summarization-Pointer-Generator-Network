A medal-winning Commonwealth Games weightlifter headbutted a Welsh competitor after a row over 'physical contact' with his victim's girlfriend.

Australian Francois Etoundi assaulted Gareth Evans, also a weightlifter, in the athletes' village on Wednesday morning, Glasgow Sheriff Court heard.

The incident unfolded after Mr Evans' girlfriend and a number of other people had congratulated Etoundi, 29, for winning a bronze medal by 'physically taking hold of him'.

Gareth Evans suffered an 'uncomplicated fracture to his nose' after being assaulted by Francois Etoundi, the court heard. He is pictured in action in the men's 62kg category at the Commonwealth Games

Procurator fiscal depute Stuart Fauré said Etoundi was staying in the athletes' village at the time of the incident.

He told the court there was a lead up to the assault around 4.45am in the morning of July 30 when Mr Evans and his friend Sonny Webster - a weightlifter for England - were in the 'mess hall' having breakfast.

Etoundi went into the hall and asked Mr Evans to go outside for a fight but Mr Evans ignored him and carried on having his breakfast.

Mr Fauré said: 'The accused left the dining room. At approximately 5.30am that same morning the complainer and Mr Webster left the dining room and whilst they were walking through the athlete's village they came across the accused, Mr Etoundi.

'Mr Etoundi was in the company of some others. It's said that Mr Etoundi approached Mr Evans and headbutted him to his face, in fact the blow struck Mr Evans on his nose.

Francois Etoundi won a bronze medal in the men's 77kg weightlifting competition in the Commonwealth Games. But trouble brewed after Gareth Evans' girlfriend congratulated him for the result, the court heard

Etoundi, pictured, had gone to an athletes' village restaurant where he was congratulated by a number of people including Mr Evans' girlfriend, who 'physically took hold of him', the court heard

'The incident was in relatively short compass. Mr Evans said it was totally unprovoked. The accused made off from the scene.'

Mr Evans was described as having an 'uncomplicated fracture to his nose' and given painkillers.

Police later detained Etoundi and as they did he said: 'Yeah, yeah, I understand, I'm cool man.'

He later made no reply when charged by the police after being interviewed.

Mr Hunter, defending, said that Etoundi was originally from Cameroon but lives in Australia with his girlfriend. He had won bronze on July 29 in the 77kg category of weightlifting.

He said his client had gone to the restaurant where he was congratulated by a number of people including Mr Evans' girlfriend, who 'physically took hold of him'.

The lawyer told the court Mr Evans 'didn't appear to be greatly impressed by the physical contact between the two and words were exchanged'.

He said they went their separate ways until later when they met again, when words were exchanged  and the assault took place.

Mr Hunter told the court his client has had his accreditation taken from him and is unable to take part in the closing ceremony.

Sheriff Andrew Cubie ordered Etoundi to pay £400 compensation to Mr Evans.

He told the athlete: 'I sense from Mr Hunter you yourself are disappointed in your conduct, you should be.'

Toilets for disabled visitors to the Commonwealth Games have been destroyed in a deliberate fire that caused £50,000 of damage.

Twelve portable loos at Prospecthill Road in the Toryglen area of Glasgow were set alight at about 5am.

Police Scotland detective constable David Hardie, from Glasgow city centre CID, has appealed for witnesses to the 'sickening' crime.

He said: 'The portable loos were placed there for disabled guests who were attending the Commonwealth Games at Hampden.

'Alternative arrangements will now have to be put in place. It is sickening that mindless individuals carry out this sort of crime with no regard for the consequences.'

Mr Hardie said the area was relatively busy at the time with people visiting the nearby 24-hour Asda store and drivers who may have seen the fire.

He said: 'I would appeal to anyone who was in the area and saw anyone at or near the Portaloos to come forward.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.

The sheriff added: 'You have chosen to bring the law of the playground into the athlete's village. You fell out with someone about a girl and headbutted him. It's totally unacceptable behaviour.'

 Speaking outside court Australian Commonwealth Games chief executive Perry Crosswhite said: 'Absolutely, I'm disappointed. We're disappointed in any athlete who doesn't abide by the rules and goes off the rails a bit.'

He also said: 'The behaviour of our people has to be exemplary.'
