France, Spain and Belgium might not be the obvious places to look for human rights infringements but according to Amnesty International, many popular holiday spots aren't quite the paradise they appear to be.

The countries all appear on a list of destinations described by the charity as concealing a "darker 
world of tragedy and human rights abuse."

Others on the list include the Netherlands, the UK and the USA, as well as more 
obvious candidates such as the Maldives, which earlier this year 
sentenced a teenage rape victim to 100 lashes for adultery, and Sri 
Lanka which has endured decades of civil war.

Problems: Spain is the top destination for British tourists but Amnesty says it has human rights issues

Protest: A demonstration against human rights abuses by Sri Lankan refugees took place in London last year

In Europe, Spain was criticised for 
abuses including "excessive use of force" during demonstrations and a 
lack of justice for victims of the Franco regime.

France's
burka ban also attracted censure, as did its fast track procedure for 
asylum applications, which Amnesty said fell short of international 
standards.

Ireland also fell foul of the charity, 
thanks to its abortion laws and overcrowded prisons, and Germany was 
criticised for its inadequate asylum system and heavy-handed policing of
demonstrations.

Even 
Belgium and the Netherlands didn't escape without some censure, with the
former said to be discriminating against Travellers and the latter 
being castigated for 'excessive use' of immigration detention centres.

Meanwhile, the Maldives, which has boasts an average of 958,000 international visitors a year, was reprimanded for attacks carried out by
the police using truncheons and pepper-spray to crack down on largely 
peaceful demonstrations and reports that detainees have been tortured.

Beautiful Norfolk: But according to Amnesty, this picturesque scene conceals human rights abuses

Tough talking: Home Secretary Theresa May's robust stance on human rights has raised eyebrows

The
charity also pinpointed an incident that took place in May in which two
juvenile offenders were sentenced to death - despite this being 
contrary to international law - as well as the case in which a 
15-year-old raped by her step-father was sentenced to 100 lashes.

For Sri Lanka, Amnesty cited mounting
evidence of mass war crimes during the conflict with the Tamil Tigers 
and said that unlawful detentions, torture and enforced disappearances 
are "rife".

The USA was singled out for extra 
criticism thanks to its continued use of capital punishment, overuse of 
tasers and Guantanamo Bay.

The UK, which is the world's eighth most popular holiday destination, was reprimanded by the charity for the "highly controversial" Justice 
and Security Act, which allows secret courts and for the recent reduction in the amount of legal aid available to prisoners.

The charity also says "toxic language" surrounding human rights is common to the UK and raises concerns about the possible scrapping of the Human Rights Act and withdrawal from the European Court of Human Rights.

"Holidays are a time to relax and forget about life’s headaches, and we’re not expecting people to anxiously research the human rights situation of their holiday destinations," said Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen.

"But behind the sparkling seas, the luxurious hotels and picturesque landscapes, there’s a darker reality of tragedy and human rights abuse.

"Holidaymakers may want to forget about hardship and injustice and that’s understandable - but when the tan has faded and the holiday photos are filed away, this is a good time to engage with the issues that affect the locals long after the tourists have gone home."
