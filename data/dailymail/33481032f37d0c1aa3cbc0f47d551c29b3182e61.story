On graduation day next month at Bryant University in Rhode Island, some students may throw their caps in the air at the end. But taking a selfie on stage as you receive your diploma? That's a no-no.

It seems that the university is not trying to be a spoil sport. Rather, having many students stop to take selfies — 800 seniors will graduate on May 17 — will slow down the ceremony that is already several hours long.

The decree comes from University President Ronald Machtley, who already allows students to take selfies with him around campus.

'I tweet a lot, I have 2,200 followers on campus and I think the fear
 was…because I take a lot of selfies throughout the school year that it 
would become an epidemic,' he told USA TODAY. 'Our staff was trying to protect me 
and the students from making this ceremony any longer.'

However, students are welcome to take photos with him after the ceremony concludes.

'We are going to find a time so that anyone who wants to take a selfie 
won’t feel deprived. I’ll be available for selfies,' Machtley sid. 
“Graduation is the culmination of four great years. This is just a small
 piece of graduation.'

In addition, the university has set a new hashtag on Twitter so that photos students post with that tag will all go onto a special university website.

Senior Ali Luthman says some students might be upset, but 'no one is crying about it.'
