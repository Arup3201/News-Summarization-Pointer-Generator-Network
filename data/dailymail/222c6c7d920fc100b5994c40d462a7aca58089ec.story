He was seriously wounded in the trenches and was later shot down by the Germans at 18,000ft – but throughout his experiences of the Great War, Arthur Greg kept his sense of humour.

Now, the horrors faced by Arthur, who came from a wealthy mill-owning family in Cheshire, have been unearthed in an archive of letters and photographs.

Like many other families, the Gregs, who built a number of thriving mills, including Quarry Bank in Styal, near Wilmslow, sent their men into battle for King and country in 1914.

Letters discovered at Quarry Bank Mill have revealed a fascinating insight into the Greg family's loss during the First World War. Pictured is Arthur Greg seated in a plane

Trainee archivist Laura Collins stumbled across the letters at the Mill among the family's extensive collection of 
personal and business documents.

They reveal how Arthur used a dry sense of humour to mask the horrors of what he endured.

He wrote: 'Eighteen days in a fire 
trench with heavy engagements only a few hundred yards to our right, and
 more critical fighting a mile or so on our left, was not calculated to 
act as nerve tonic.'

Arthur Greg and his brother Robert were the sons of Ernest William Greg and their other brother, Alexander Carlton Greg, donated Quarry Bank Mill to the National Trust

Arthur was severely wounded after a shell dropped nearby during a German attack on the trenches.

He
 wrote: 'I went down like a log and was next aware of a loose, horrid 
and disconnected feeling about the lower part of my face... At one time I
 thought I should not live as I was bleeding so furiously. I thought it a
 pity that one more so young should have to go.'

Arthur and his brother Robert were the sons of Ernest William Greg and their other brother, Alexander Carlton Greg, donated Quarry Bank Mill to the National Trust. Barely a year after Arthur’s death in April 1917, Robert was stationed near Kummel when a shell was dropped directly on to his dug-out in the support line. Robert was fatally wounded and died days later on 3rd May 1918.

Arthur began his military career at the age of 20, when in 1914 he was commissioned as Second Lieutenant of the 3rd (Special Reserve) Battalion Cheshire Regiment, serving as a bombing officer. In May 1915 he was attached to the First Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment, 15th Brigade, 5th Division, and was stationed in Ypres, Belgium.

He led several reconnaissance missions, searching for enemy spies, often under heavy shell fire.

In November of 1915, Arthur became a captain and in 1917 he was graded as a flying officer and posted to the British Expeditionary Force, 55 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps.

But Arthur performed his final sacrifice on April 23, 1917, flying the DH4 bomber A7408.

He was involved in an air battle with German pilots, including Herman Goering, and was shot at 18,000ft. Although he managed to land the plane, he later died of his wounds.

In further documents revealed by the Quarry Bank Mill archive, Arthur's fiancee, Marian Allen, captured the bravery and grief of war in a poem written in June 1918.

Rachel Whalley, visitor experience officer, said that for the past year staff and volunteers at the mill have been reorganising the substantial archive.

She said: 'It is amazing to uncover 
hidden stories about the family. With every document we look at we are 
learning more and more about this fascinating family; not just their 
work at the mill, but their entrepreneurial roles, family stories and 
personalities.'
