Officers pulled the plug on a huge Christmas lights display after hundreds of spectators descended on the quiet cul-de-sac.

Groups of excited families flocked to see the 12 homes in Hedge End, Hampshire, and the surrounding streets decked out like a winter wonderland.

However, many were left disappointed after a neighbour alerted police - who installed a roadblock an forced homeowners to switch off the lights.

Festive: Scores of people visited the cul-de-sac in Hedge End, Hampshire, which had been lit up for charity

'Traffic chaos': One neighbour called police due to the number of visitors. Police enforced a roadblock and ordered homeowners to turn the lights off until observers had dispersed

Cars were said to be blocking roads, which raised concerns of crashes and emergency services not being able to get through.

The lights were switched off until traffic dispersed and residents were only allowed to turn them back on once the roads were clear.

Hampshire Constabulary even issued an online warning urging people to stay away from the area.

Participants have raised £25,000 for a children’s hospice by lighting up their homes from December 1 to January 1 for the last 10 years.

Many reacted angrily to the intervention and branded the shutdown ‘disgusting’.

Hanna Robinson wrote on Facebook: 'I think this is a disgusting and disrespectful status from Hampshire constabulary.

'The residents in this road have come together as a community to raise money for charity, and all you can do is worry about a bit of congestion for a few nights.

'You should be spending more time fighting real crime than to be writing statuses like this... We took our three children there last night for the first time and the looks on their faces were worth a million pounds.

'I think it’s lovely the hard work the people in that road are going to to raise money and more of us should take a leaf out of their books rather than them being punished for a good deed.

'I for one will be supporting there efforts.'

Onlooker Carly Hughes wrote: 'Can’t believe people would complain about this! We have just been and it was magical and all for charity!

'As we were leaving the police officer stopping everyone turning into the road said it was chaos and the road was gridlocked.

'There wasn’t one car driving down the road, everyone was on foot and yes it was busy but for good reason! People need to find some Christmas spirit!'

'Punished for a good deed': One visitor hit out at the police action, saying officers were 'disrespectful' and 'disgusting' for shutting it down

Another, Gemma Burgess, said the families should be rewarded for putting the lights up and footing steep electricity bills for a good cause.

She wrote: 'They do this not only for charity that they do every year but also to see the smiles on the kids’ faces.

'A lot of people can’t afford to take their kids for Christmas days out so they take them there to see the lights.

'My kids love it and look forward to it. Yes tonight it was busy but more people means more donations and how can anyone moan about that!! Bah humbug!!'

And Andy Grant-West added: 'This is a charity and community thing. Our money goes regularly on police having to be at events like football that a lot of people have no interest in, but we are forced to live with it and put up with it.

'Christmas is once a year and the lights are for a charity. Can the police not extend their services and be charitable at this time of year?'

Intervention: Police even issued an online warning, saying visitors must stay away from the area

A resident, who asked not to be named, said the fundraisers were due to meet with police over the future of the lights.

The retired man said: 'There were hundreds and hundreds of people here and with cars parked on verges and blocking access there were fears about public safety and crashes.

'The police said it was a public order issue because of all the congestion.

'It’s a shame because at the end of the day we’re doing this for charity.

'Some people come back every night because their children love the lights so much - the reward is seeing the delighted look on their little faces.

Congestion: Hampshire police said that some were 'concerned about congestion around the Christmas lights

'When the congestion had eased, there was an outcry to be allowed to turn the lights back on. The officers on the ground got the go-ahead from their superiors and eventually we could.

'But we’ve got to have a meeting to see if we can continue using them.'

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: 'We were called to the Stephenson Way and Britannia Gardens area of Hedge End at 5pm on Sunday.

'Some local residents reported concerns about traffic congestion due to the numbers of motorists visiting Christmas lights.

'Police worked with residents and visitors to help clear the traffic congestion as swiftly and as safely as possible.'
