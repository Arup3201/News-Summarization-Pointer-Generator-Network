Edward Snowden has highly sensitive documents on how the National Security Agency is structured and operates that could harm the U.S. government, but has insisted that they not be made public, a journalist close to the NSA leaker said.

Glenn Greenwald, a columnist with The Guardian newspaper who first reported on the intelligence leaks, told The Associated Press that disclosure of the information in the documents 'would allow somebody who read them to know exactly how the NSA does what it does, which would in turn allow them to evade that surveillance or replicate it.'

He said the 'literally thousands of documents' taken by Snowden constitute 'basically the instruction manual for how the NSA is built.'

During Friday's meeting Edward Snowden told human rights activists he plans to stay in Russia temporarily, but officials say they haven't received any request

'In
order to take documents with him that proved that what he was saying 
was true he had to take ones that included very sensitive, detailed 
blueprints of how the NSA does what they do,' the journalist said Sunday
in a Rio de Janeiro hotel room. He said the interview was taking place 
about four hours after his last interaction with Snowden.

Greenwald
said he believes the disclosure of the information in the documents 
would not prove harmful to Americans or their national security, but 
that Snowden has insisted they not be made public.

'I
think it would be harmful to the U.S. government, as they perceive 
their own interests, if the details of those programs were revealed,' he
said.

He has previously said the documents have been encrypted to help ensure their safekeeping.

Snowden
emerged from weeks of hiding in a Moscow airport Friday, and said he 
was willing to meet President Vladimir Putin's condition that he stop 
leaking U.S. secrets if it means Russia would give him asylum until he 
can move on to Latin America.

Greenwald
told The AP that he deliberately avoids talking to Snowden about issues
related to where the former analyst might seek asylum in order to avoid
possible legal problems for himself

Guarded: The world's media were eager to get a glimpse of the fugitive whistleblower who remains at the police guarded transit area of the airport, where the meeting took place

Snowden
is believed to be stuck in the transit area of Moscow's main 
international airport, where he arrived from Hong Kong on June 23. He's 
had offers of asylum from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia, but because 
his U.S. passport has been revoked, the logistics of reaching whichever 
country he chooses are complicated.

Still, Greenwald said that Snowden remains 'calm and tranquil,' despite his predicament.

'I
haven't sensed an iota of remorse or regret or anxiety over the 
situation that he's in,' said Greenwald, who has lived in Brazil for the
past eight years. 'He's of course tense and focused on his security and
his short-term well-being to the best extent that he can, but he's very
resigned to the fact that things might go terribly wrong and he's at 
peace with that.'

Greenwald 
said he worried that interest in Snowden's personal saga had detracted 
from the impact of his revelations, adding that Snowden deliberately 
turned down nearly all requests for interviews to avoid the media 
spotlight.

Asked whether Snowden seemed worried about his personal safety, Greenwald responded, 'he's concerned.'

He
said the U.S. has shown it's 'willing to take even the most extreme 
steps if they think doing so is necessary to neutralize a national 
security threat,' Greenwald said. 'He's aware of all those things, he's 
concerned about them but he's not going to be in any way paralyzed or 
constrained in what he thinks he can do as a result of that.'

Asked
about a so-called dead man's pact, which Greenwald has said would allow
several people to access Snowden's trove of documents were anything to 
happen to him, Greenwald replied that 'media descriptions of it have 
been overly simplistic.

'It's
not just a matter of, if he dies, things get released, it's more 
nuanced than that,' he said. 'It's really just a way to protect himself 
against extremely rogue behavior on the part of the United States, by 
which I mean violent actions toward him, designed to end his life, and 
it's just a way to ensure that nobody feels incentivized to do that.'

He declined to provide any more details about the pact or how it would work.

Greenwald said he himself has beefed up his own security, particularly since a laptop went missing from his Rio home.

'I
don't really feel comfortable discussing the specific measures, but one
would be really irrational and foolish to have thousands of top-secret 
documents from the most secretive agency of the world's most powerful 
government and not be thoughtful about added security,' said the 
46-year-old former constitutional and civil rights lawyer who has 
written three books contending the government has violated personal 
rights in the name of protecting national security.

Greenwald
has also co-authored a series of articles in Rio de Janeiro's O Globo 
newspaper focusing on NSA actions in Latin America. He said he expected 
to continue publishing further stories based on other Snowden documents 
over the next four months.

Upcoming
stories would likely include details on 'other domestic spying programs
that have yet to be revealed,' but which are similar in scope to those 
he has been reporting on. He did not provide further details on the 
nature of those programs.

It
was not immediately clear whether Russia would take Snowden up on his 
latest request for asylum, which could further test U.S.-Russia 
relations.

Following 
Friday's meeting between Snowden and human rights activists, U.S. 
officials criticized Russia for allowing a 'propaganda platform' for the
NSA leader.

White House 
spokesman Jay Carney said Russia should instead send Snowden back to the
U.S. to face the felony charges that are pending against him.

Carney
said Snowden is not a human rights activist or a dissident. 'He is 
accused of leaking classified information, has been charged with three 
felony counts and should be returned to the United States,' the 
spokesman said.

The escape route is fraught with problems for Snowden, and would mean him having to gain access to Russia and then taking a huge detour
