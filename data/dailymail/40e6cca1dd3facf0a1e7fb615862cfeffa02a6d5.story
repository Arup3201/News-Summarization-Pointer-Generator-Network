Newborn twins who were born prematurely after ambulance crews spent half an hour trying to get into their pregnant mother's tower block have had their life support machines turned off.

Jocelyn Bennett, 27, was rushed to hospital from Pleck House, on Winterbourne Croft, Druids Heath in Birmingham and gave birth to Rose and Melody by emergency caesarean section.

But with Ms Bennett still in a coma after the ordeal, her devastated family have switched off the twins' life support machine in a poignant farewell - as nursery rhymes played in the background. 

Jocelyn Bennett, left, called 999 over stomach pains, but paramedics couldn't enter  Pleck House tower block in Birmingham for 30 minutes. She was rushed to hospital and gave birth to twin girls Rose and Melody. Ms Bennett's father Joe is shown right holding one of the babies in a picture released by the family

The twins were starved of oxygen after paramedics were locked out of the council-run tower block from which their 27-year-old mum dialled 999 for half-an-hour.

They suffered multi-organ failure and lack of oxygen to their brain.

Ms Bennett was found unconscious after her heart stopped.

At 1pm today her partner Kevin Clarke, 31, along with the couple's close relatives, wept as medics turned off the babies' life support machines at Birmingham Women's Hospital.

A hospital chaplain performed a touching service and the babies were placed in their father's arms for a last cuddle. 

Ms Bennett had dialled 999 after being woken by severe stomach pains in the early hours of last Wednesday morning.

But when a first response paramedic arrived in 12 minutes at Pleck House tower, Ms Bennet was unable to answer the buzzer.

Ms Bennett, who was 32 weeks pregnant, had suffered a placental abruption which had left her in too much pain to reach the entry button.

An emergency crew that arrived at the scene failed to reach other neighbours through the buzzer system for help at the tower block.

The police were called and helped the crew to enter the building and the paramedics reached Ms Bennett at 6.10am – some 30 minutes after she dialled 999 at 5.39am.

But by the time the ambulance crew arrived at Ms Bennett's home on the third floor of the tower block, her heart had stopped and she was lying on the floor.

Pleck House in Druids Heath, where residents say the intercom system is faulty or answers in a foreign voice

Birmingham City Council are investigating why paramedics were unable to gain access to Ms Bennett's home in Pleck House.

After Ms Bennett was rushed to Birmingham Women's Hospital, hours later she gave birth to Melody, weighing 4lbs 1oz, and Rose, who weighed 3lbs, by emergency caesarean section.

Her family had had the little girls christened and held a Christmas party for them as they worry Ms Bennett will suffer brain damage.

Ms Bennett's father, Joe, said his daughter and her partner Kevin Clarke had been so excited about the twins they had named them weeks ago.

Mr Bennett, from Kings Norton, said his daughter had a trouble-free pregnancy up to last Wednesday and had enjoyed a family party just days earlier.

The 54-year-old said this afternoon: 'It was so hard and I could barely breath.

'They looked so perfect and when the ventilators were taken off their tiny bodies, I expected them to start moving.

'The vicar performed a lovely service and then the girls were held by Kevin for the last time.

'We left him with the twins so he could spend time with them on his own.'

'Jocelyn is still in a coma but we wanted to be able to give her closure too.

'We have been through so many emotions. What helped us was the support that we had from people online.

'It was amazing.'

Earlier Kevin, who also has a three-year-old son, Slater, with Jocelyn, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Thank you everyone for all your support.

Ms Bennett and her partner Kevin were so excited about the baby girls (shown in pictures released by the family) that they had christened them weeks ago

'Joyce is still in a coma and today the babies will have the life support switched off.

'Thanks again for all your prayers.' 

Earlier, Mr Bennett, had said of his daughter's ordeal: 'It could have all been so different if the ambulance crews could have reached her earlier.'

He feared that an out-of order trades entrance and inefficient entry system at Pleck House had prevented paramedics from reaching his daughter in time.

'The fact that paramedics couldn't get in was down to the terrible entry system at the building,' he said.

'There needs to be a better way for emergency services to access these flats.

'Because of this, I will lose my two precious grandchildren and my daughter is fighting for her life.

'Something needs to be done by the council about this because if there is another emergency, this could happen again. I cannot fault the paramedics and the police as they tried their best to get to Jocelyn as quickly as they could.'

Mr Bennett does not blame Jocelyn's neighbours either and said that a police raid at the tower block had left residents reluctant to answer unexpected calls.

'If any residents see flashing blue lights they don't answer their calls because they fear it'll be another raid. No one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them.

Mr Bennett said emergency numbers are on the inside of the building at Pleck House which didn't help police

'The trades entrance had been deactivated so they weren't able to get in that way.

'All the emergency numbers are on the inside of the building which didn't help the police and the ambulance crew. It took the police around 20 minutes to get through the front door when they did arrive.

'There are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them. A better system needs to be in place.

'Jocelyn had been blooming throughout her pregnancy up until this. She had been to a family party a few days before and had a great time. Her and Kevin had named the babies and were so excited about them.

'Her illness came out of the blue. Her placenta had come away and by the time she got to the hospital and underwent surgery she had lost two litres of blood. She suffered multi-organ failure.'

A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time.

This is the tragic timeline that shows it took paramedics some 30 minutes to reach Jocelyn Bennett after she called 999 after suffering severe stomach pains. 

'We have systems to provide emergency access to our blocks for the emergency services and we are investigating what happened in this instance.'

West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed it received an emergency call from Pleck House at 5.39am last Wednesday.

A spokesman said: 'West Midlands Ambulance Service can confirm it received a call to Pleck House, Winterbourne Croft, Kings Heath, Birmingham at 5.39am on Wednesday 29th October 2014.

'The first resource to arrive outside the building was a paramedic in a rapid response vehicle, at 5.51am.

'Two ambulance crews then arrived outside the premises at 5.58am and 6.01am respectively.

'Crews had difficulty getting into the building. They tried to contact other flats within the block; all with no answer. The control room contacted the patient's parents and partner by telephone.

'The ambulance service requested the help of police at 6.03am. Police arrived at 6.10am and entry to the building was gained soon after.'

Police confirmed officers arrived at the scene and 6.10am and gained entry shortly afterwards.

A spokesman said: 'We were called by the ambulance service at 6.03am on 29 October and arrived at Pleck House at 6.10am.'

Tower block neighbours of Ms Bennett have complained about the security system at Pleck House.

Some residents said their buzzers did not work and the intercom system in the entrance gave instructions in foreign languages.

Jade Butler, 22,  said she heard a buzzer being rung in the early hours of Wednesday, October 29, when Jocelyn Bennett fell ill.

She said: 'The buzzer was being pressed between 4.30am and 5.30am last Wednesday. I wasn't expecting anybody. I thought who's ringing the buzzer at that time in the morning? 

'A few times people have rung the buzzer just to be let into the block so I don't answer.

'I thought the police and emergency services had a fob to get in? It's a shame, they should've been able to get to her.'

Another resident, who did not wish to give their name, said: 'If you don't have a fob, you can't get in and if the emergency services want to get in they have to press the trade button which doesn't work. 

'The system is all in German, so you can't get in.

'Most peoples buzzers don't work and some people have them turned off because you get everyone pressing them all the time saying 'let me in.''

Another resident said: 'It's a disgrace. When people try to buzz me, it doesn't make a noise and I can't let them in.'
