Tiger Woods was all smiles again as he prepared for his PGA Tour return as he spoke about the lost tooth he suffered while supporting skiing star girlfriend Lindsey Vonn.

Woods is smiling again as he's now over his back injury, but he had some explaining to do after being pictured without a front tooth on what was meant to be a covert visit to celebrate Vonn's World Cup ski record.

'I had my mask on so no one knew who I was, trying to blend in, because there is not a lot of brown dudes at ski races, okay?' Woods said after a practice round at TPC Scottsdale.

'A dude with a video camera on his shoulder stood up and turned and caught me square on the mouth. And so then I'm trying to keep this thing so the blood is not all over the place. The flight home was a joke. I couldn't eat, couldn't drink, even breathing hurt.' 

Woods was not happy the incident stole the limelight from Vonn's achievements. 'The story is about Lindsey breaking the record. That's the story. I mean, every sport you get teeth knocked out, and unfortunately I wasn't actually competing and got my teeth knocked out.'

This week Woods shares the limelight with the NFL Super Bowl also being held in Phoenix on Sunday – and he plans to attend despite the golf usually finishing at 4pm and the Super Bowl kicking off just half an hour later 30 miles away in Glendale.

'I'd like to. That's the plan. I just wish my Raiders were there, but they're not.'
