VAT change: George Osborne's decision to close the tax loophole will raise around £100m a year

A sales tax loophole used by millions to buy cheap CDs, DVDs, computer games and even contact lenses from the Channel Islands is to be closed.

Chancellor George Osborne has decided on a change to the VAT regime in a move that will cost shoppers at least £100million a year.

Currently, low value items costing less than £15 can be imported to the UK and from locations outside the EU - such as the Channel Islands - without carrying VAT.

This has allowed large firms like Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Boots, to set up warehouse operations in the Channel Islands to sell cheaper - VAT-free products to UK consumers.

Amazon and other fast-growing internet specialists, such as Play.com and TheHut.com, use the same ploy.

The decision to close the VAT loophole suggests these firms will now add the sales tax to all their products shipped in from the Channel Islands.

The change, which comes into effect in April next year, could add £2 to the price of a blockbuster DVD, such as the Lion King, taking it up to £12.

A chart CD, such as Adele’s 21, could go up by £1.60 to around £9.60.

The VAT loophole has been a disaster for small independent chains and others for many years amid claims it has snatched sales from the high street.

A spokesman for Tesco today vowed to keep prices low despite the duty rise.

'We always seek to be competitive on price and have no immediate plans to increase prices as a result of the change,' he said.

'We welcome this news and have been supportive of a level playing field for some time now.'

Critics such as the Forum for Private
Business (FPB) claim it led to the closure of hundreds of stores and 
associated job losses.

The last Labour government rejected repeated calls to change the VAT rules, insisting it was not a loophole.

However, the Chancellor criticised the system when in Opposition and is now in a position to do something about it.

Conservative
Treasury Minister, David Gauke, described the move, which will bring in
an extra £100million in VAT to government coffers, as a victory for 
small business and taxpayers.

‘These reforms will ensure that UK companies, especially small and medium sized enterprises, can compete on a level playing field with those larger companies with the resources to set up operations in the Channel Islands,’ he said.

‘We are also protecting a significant amount of tax revenue. By making these changes, we are striking the best possible balance between the costs of collecting small amounts of VAT and protecting the interests of UK taxpayers and businesses.’

Senior policy adviser at the FPB, Phil McCabe, said: ‘This is a victory for small, hard-pressed shops and internet traders on the mainland who have suffered for decades because of this anti-competitive tax loophole.

‘For too long large retailers have been able to undercut them by 20 per cent on the price of a wide range of goods imported VAT free via the Channel Islands and sold online. It has had a devastating impact.’
