British hopeful Shanaze Reade has dropped out of next week's UCI BMX World Championships after breaking her elbow in a painful crash at her Denmark training camp.

Reade, who was aiming for her fourth gold medal in Rotterdam, also suffered injuries to her face after vaulting the handlebars during practice - and posted evidence of her injuries online.

The Olympian rider is now targeting a comeback to secure a US national title - where she currently sits top of the series on points.

The 25-year-old already has World Championships titles from Victoria in 2007, Taiyuan in 2008 and at Adelaide in 2010 but she will miss the chance to add to that impressive string of medals in Rotterdam on Tuesday.

But despite the sad end to her hopes, Reade wished her fellow Brits well in Holland, posting: 'Good luck to all the Brits going to Worlds!!'
