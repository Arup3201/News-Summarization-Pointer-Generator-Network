A gang of Conservative MPs tried to sabotage the filming of a ground-breaking documentary in Parliament by plotting to trip up a cameraman.

The group of ‘right wing Tories’ had been incensed by the decision to allow the acclaimed film-maker Michael Cockerell to film their activities inside the House of Commons for a year.

It was revealed yesterday that Commons officials got wind of a scheme last year to disrupt filming while all MPs were packed into the chamber to watch Prime Minister’s Questions.

The MPs hoped to force the Speaker, John Bercow, to halt proceedings and to scupper the rest of the project but their plot was foiled at the last minute by Parliament’s security chief, the Serjeant-at-Arms.

Mr Cockerell, who has interviewed a record eight Prime Ministers, was allowed to film the corridors of power where cameras have always been forbidden, only after six years of painstaking negotiations with the Parliamentary authorities. 

The four-part series ‘Inside the Commons’ which begins next Tuesday on BBC2, involved nearly 600 hours of filming.

His team follow MPs, ministers, David Cameron and Ed Miliband, and the army of behind-the-scenes staff who keep the House running, from the waitress who sings as she serves the members’ tea to the Hawker who keeps the pigeons off the nineteenth century stonework.

One scene involved filming with drones to capture the spectacle of the four-man abseiling team who, every five years, are deployed to clean and fix up the clock face of Big Ben.

His footage inside the corridors of the eighteenth century building shows the rack where MPs from times past could store their swords. To his surprise, one solitary wooden sword is hanging up.

Mr Cockerell said the editing was intended to be ‘mischievous’.

In one scene Sir Nicholas Soames speaks of discovering a new bar on the Parliamentary estate, and the film then cuts away to an interview with former Liberal Democrat Charles Kennedy, who had a high-profile battle with alcoholism.

And Tory MP Andrew Percy reveals the emailed list of ‘free hit’ questions which are MPs are sent by Number 10 aides to ask at PMQs, involving jobs and economic growth.

Mr Percy explains that the purpose is for the MP to mention the Conservatives’ ‘long term economic plan’ if they are picked to ask a question, and his fellow MP Andrew Selous is shown doing just that.

But the veteran broadcaster revealed that not all MPs were supportive of the project, and a small number declined to take part altogether.

Last year Tory MP Bill Wiggin was seen on television protesting to the Speaker that the cameras were getting in the way of members watching the session – and was slapped down.

However Mr Cockerell said he became aware another group had plotted to disrupt the entire project.

‘There were occasional times when MPs on the naughty bench, right up at the back on the right, weren’t very pleased with our presence’, he said.

‘ There was a plan by some backbenchers which was thwarted by the man in charge of security. The doorkeepers are the eyes and ears of this place and they understood what was apparently planned.

‘It was right wing Tories, but I won’t be fingering anyone by name. We chose a place for the cameraman, on the two sides of the House where we wouldn’t get in the way, so we could get a shot at eye level which you couldn’t get from the high cameras. And apparently, after many months of negotiations, some people thought we still shouldn’t be there.

‘You could see where the cameraman and if you leant backwards, maybe the cameraman would go backwards, I don’t know I’m not privy to the details. But they averted it.’

The first episode follows two new MPs elected in 2010, Charlotte Leslie, the Tory MP for Bristol North West and Sarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham as they find their feet.

David Cameron and Ed Miliband talk about their experience of PMQs, with the Prime Minister saying: ‘About five minutes beforehand you think, ‘Have I got to do this again?’ The Labour leader says: ‘I find the anticipation is worse than the reality.’

The series will also have revelations about the rumoured clash between Mr Bercow and the Clerk of the House Sir Robert Rogers – who explains the growing challenges of running the crumbling building - shortly before Sir Robert suddenly announced his early retirement.
