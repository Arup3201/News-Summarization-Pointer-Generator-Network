His lavish lifestyle ended with his arrest last year, but a suspected Massachusetts drug lord is finding it hard to adjust to the hardships of prison life.

Alleged gang leader Alexis 'Papi-Thing' Hidalgo has written a letter complaining about the 'terrible food' and stingy soap supplies at Plymouth County Correctional Facility, where he is awaiting trial.

The 32-year-old, who allegedly used drug money to fund a life full of flashy sports cars and luxury hotel stays, has requested a transfer to a prison that would suit his needs better.

Rough ride: Alexis Hidalgo, the alleged leader of a Boston drugs gang, has complained about prison conditions

In a letter to district court magistrate Judge Robert B Collings, he complained that conditions were unsanitary and put his health at risk, Boston Herald reported.

'I understand this is prison, I buy 
Commisary [sic] that I'm forced to use cold sink water to cook with, 
which can bring health issues,' he wrote.

Hidalgo, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, oxycodone and marijuana, also complained that the water tasted funny and was causing rashes in fellow inmates.

It is a far cry from the life he is alleged to have led before a wire tap led to his arrest.

He and co-accused Jonathan 'The Don' DaSilvaÂ  allegedly spent thousands of dollars during the 18-months they were under police watch.

The pair reportedly rented high-end sports cars, stayed at luxury hotels and splashed out on a $10,000 table at a celebrity awards ceremony.

As he awaits trial however, Hidalgo complained in his November 4 letter that even the soap was rationed to a travel size bar handed out every fortnight.

Hidalgo drew a sad face next to his complaint that he was 'not allowed to buy soap' and claimed that the measly ration lasted only three days, forcing him to use 'unsanitary' washing up liquid.

He also complained that the jail had no microwaves, a claim that was proudly confirmed by prison spokesman John Birkwell.

'There are no microwaves and no Keurig 
machines or latte machines in the individual units, for obvious health 
and security reasons,' Mr Birtwell told Boston Herald.

Hidalgo also claimed he was unable to attend church, writing: 'ima a born-again Christian, threw [sic] god grace an blessing, im truely bothered with this one question? your Honor how am i being denied my god given as well as Constitutional right to practice religion.'

The suspect, whose alleged drug empire was said to stretch from California, Maine and Miami, also complained that the jail failed to offer educational programs and drug-abuse counseling.

The prison said these services were offered only to inmates serving a sentence as opposed to those waiting for their trial to begin.

He signed off the letter by congratulating the judge on his forthcoming retirement and called him a 'true class act'.

Judge Collings has sent the letter on to the U.S. Marshals Service and Hidalgo is still being detained at Plymouth.
