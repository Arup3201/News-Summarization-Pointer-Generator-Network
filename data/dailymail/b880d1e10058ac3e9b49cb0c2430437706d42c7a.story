Wildlife officials in Maine have come under attack for failing to intervene to save the life of a baby bald eagle they were filming on a webcam.

Viewers across the United States called and emailed the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife as they watched the eaglet struggle for survival.

They asked officials to step in when it seemed that the parents had abandoned the pair of baby bald eagles in a coastal Maine nest. One of the eaglets died over the weekend.

But state raptor specialist Erynn Call has defending their decision not to intervene before an eaglet featured on the webcam died.

She said it's common for eagles to die before reaching maturity. If one of the two eagles survives, then that would be considered a success.

It's also the state's policy not to intervene, she said.

On its website, the Biodiversity Research Institute, which operates the webcam, wrote that it did not intend to remove the remaining eagle chick from the nest.

'We have been in contact with many individuals and agencies to determine the best path forward after one chick perished over the weekend,' a statement posted Monday reads.

'The remaining eaglet is being fed by adults and it is ALWAYS best for young eagles to develop bonds and learn life skills from parent eagles. Though there is always uncertainty in the natural world, all signs point toward this chick being successful.'

The statement went on: 'We understand that our decision not to intervene may be difficult for some viewers, but we continue to maintain that the Maine Eagle webcams are an opportunity for citizens and students to observe the natural world in it's purest form and to understand the many pressures that wildlife face.Â 

On Wednesday, the webcam showed the survivor getting a meal of a bird that was shredded to pieces by an adult eagle.

The eaglet squawked loudly as it snapped up the meal.

Biodiversity Research Institute outreach director Patrick Keenan added: 'The general view is not to intervene. These are wildlife. They're not pets. They're generally better off in their natural surroundings.'
