Arnold Prieto was executed in Texas on Wednesday night for his role in a 1993 triple murder

A Texas man has been executed by lethal injection for a triple murder committed in 1993.

Arnold Prieto's execution started at 6.11pm on Wednesday and he was pronounced dead 20 minutes later after a lethal dose of pentobarbital began flowing into his veins.

Asked by the warden if he had a final statement, Prieto replied: 'There are no endings, only beginnings. Love y'all. See you soon.' 

As the lethal injection started, Prieto said 'I can smell it.......Whoa' before he took several sharp breaths and then all movement stopped.

Texas has stopped the tradition of offering a last meal and so Prieto had the prison meal of barbecue chopped beef, carrots & pinto beans with a choice of tea or water.

Prieto was barely out of his teens when he and two friends, brothers Jesse and Guadalupe Hernandez, murdered Rodolfo Rodriguez, 72, his wife, Virginia, 62, and Paula Moran, 90, whom Rodolfo and Virginia cared for at their home.

Up until his death Prieto had maintained his innocence in the deaths of Virginia and Moran, although he had admitted to killing Rodolfo by stabbing the man to death with a screwdriver.  

The Houston Chronicle reports that in a statement to police after the murders, Prieto admitted that the boys had been doing cocaine on the night before the murders, and that it was Guadalupe's idea to drive to the Rodriguez home and kill the three in order to steal $10,000 he believed they had for a check cashing business they ran from their home.

When they arrived at the home in the middle of the night, Virginia made the boys a breakfast of tortillas and eggs, and after they finished eating Prieto claims Guadalupe stabbed the woman to death with a screwdriver.

After that, Prieto stabbed Rodolfo to death and and Jesse killed Moran.

They left with some jewelry and $300 in cash, and were eventually apprehended when a ring belonging to Prieto was found at the scene of the crime.

Jesse was just 16-years-old at the time and is serving a life sentence, having been too young to be eligible for the death penalty. 

He had told police that Prieto was responsible for all of the killings. 

Guadalupe, who even police identified as the mastermind behind the murders, eventually had all charges against him dropped and served no time behind bars.

Prieto was offered a plea deal of life in prison if he testified against the other two men, but he refused to do so. 

'As you can see, the cards are stacked up against me,' wrote Prieto recently on the popular death penalty blog Minutes Before Six. 

'Nothing new really, since they have been stacked from the very beginning. … Where is the dangerous killer and monster (jurors) foresaw??? … Maybe the crystal ball was cloudy during those days or maybe they did not shake the ball hard enough.' 

No late appeals were filed in the courts to try to halt his punishment.

Prieto spurned a plea deal for a sentence of less than life in prison if he would testify against one of his companions.

'There was a way out,' one of Prieto's trial lawyers, Michael Bernard, recalled last week. 'We just couldn't get there.'

This will be the first death by lethal injection in Texas this year, with two more scheduled for next week.
