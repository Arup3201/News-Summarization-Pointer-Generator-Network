A freak lightning strike  that sounded 'like a bomb going off' sparked a massive blaze and gutted the top floor of a six-bedroom house.

The family-of-four were watching television at about 9pm on Monday evening when they heard a bang and the power suddenly went off at their home in Winterbourne Down, Bristol.

Initially they thought it was a fault with their washing machine, which had just started a cycle, until they heard neighbours screaming at them to get out.

The family were downstairs at the time the lightning struck as fire ravaged through the children's bedrooms

They managed to escape with their two dogs as fire ripped through the top floor of the property -thought to be worth more than £500,000 - before part of the ceiling collapsed into a bedroom.

Mother Dawn, who lives at the address with her husband and two children aged, 12 and ten and does not want to reveal her surname, said the family is lucky to be alive. 

'I usually put the children to bed at nine but I was running late and they were in the living room watching telly with my husband while I was in the kitchen putting a wash on.

'I was just walking away from the machine when I heard an almighty bang and everything went into darkness.

'I started screaming and the children came running out frightened.

'We thought it was the electrics so I got a torch and my husband went and looked in the fuse box but it had blew off the wall.

Dawn said her family is lucky to be alive and has been left 'heartbroken' by the freak incident

'We opened the door because we could hear shouting and the neighbours were behind our electric gates, which they couldn't open.

'They'd heard the bang and thought their car had exploded and then saw our roof was on fire.'

She said they were probably in the house for about five minutes before getting out and calling the fire service.

'If it hadn't been for the neighbours it would have spread even more.

'The fire brigade had to fight it from outside because it was too intense before they could go in and it took about four hours to put it out.

'I dread to think what could have happened if the children had been upstairs. I'm just so glad they're okay - it could have been a lot worse,' she said. 

It is thought it will cost thousands of pounds to fix the damage as the whole of the upstairs may need to be gutted.

The family had spent 11 years building and renovating the house to their own specifications after buying it as a four-bedroom home and converting it.

Dawn said they had just put the finishing touches to it when the freak fire destroyed the boys bedrooms. 

Avon Fire and Rescue Service said that extensive fire damage had been caused to the roof, while water damage was throughout the house from extinguishing the flames.

The exact cost of the damage is not yet known but is thought to be thousands of pounds worth of repairs

Dawn added: 'The firefighters said they couldn't believe the strength of the lightning - they said we were lucky to be alive.

'We are heartbroken. Much of our stuff is ruined. Because we were getting ready for bed all I had was my sisters clothes - most of my clothes are ruined. We have some of the boys clothes. 

'We'd like to thank the fire service and the police for all they did and are just glad that our family is okay.' 

The family are currently living in a hotel until they can arrange other accommodation but have been told it could be at least Christmas time before they will be able to move back in.

'The children have been left traumatised and say they don't want to go back. At the moment I'm keeping them off school because they are too upset.'

From crystal balls to Nutella jars to sparkly doorknobs: Fire chiefs warn of the everyday objects that could destroy your home

Fire chiefs have issued a warning about the dangers of leaving glass objects in sunlight - after they were blamed for 125 fires in just one city.

The statistics also come after the luxury £2million pad of underwear tycoon Michelle Mone was set alight when sunlight reflected off a mirror and onto a beanbag, and a family pet was killed by a blaze started by a Nutella jar.

Now firefighters have revealed the scale of fires caused by light refracting through items such as glass door knobs and crystal balls in the capital in the last five years.

Underwear tycoon, Michelle Mone, revealed last week that her £2million  home caught alight after sunlight bounced off a mirror and onto a beanbag

The London Fire Brigade is warning homeowners of the danger of leaving glass objects in direct contact with sunlight.

Charlie Pugsley from the brigade's fire investigation unit said: 'These sort of fires are not as rare as you would think - I've seen everything from sparkly door knobs to crystal balls starting fires.

'Crystal and glass ornaments and items such as mirror tables should be kept out of direct sunlight.

'We wouldn't advise that people put fires out themselves but it is good to see that Ms Mone is not injured.

'This shows these fires are not an urban myth. Also make sure that you have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home.'

The LFB also stressed that these blazes don't just occur in the summer, with two happening this year already.

The bending of light in refraction, when light passes through an object of a different density, can cause rays to be focused onto one spot and therefore intensified.

Investigators believe a house fire that killed a Jack Russell started when low winter sunlight was refracted through a glass Nutella jar, which was storing loom bands, and set fire to nearby blinds.

The fire killed family pet Chili and gutted a bedroom and part of their roof, in Twickenham, south west London, on February 15.

Bra supremo Michelle revealed on Wednesday last week that she was alerted by a burning smell in her home in Mayfair, west London, when a beanbag caught alight.

She managed to extinguish the fire herself after the rays refracted off a mirror table earlier this month.

Crews tackled a blaze in Clapham, south London, in July last year when rays passed through a crystal door know and set fire to a dressing gown.

And a home was torched when a crystal ball intensified the sun's rays in Romford, east London, in February, 2014.
