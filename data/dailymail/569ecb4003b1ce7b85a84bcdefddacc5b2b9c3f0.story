A drunk man was given a sobering experience - after falling off a balcony and finding himself hanging by his fingertips over a 100ft drop.

Yu Yang had been drunkenly singing and staggering around his home in the city of Haikou, the capital of southern China's Hainan province.

The 48-year-old was told to go and sit on the balcony by his wife and family, because he was annoying them.

But after sitting on the edge of the metal balcony instead of on the seat, he toppled over backward. Despite his inebriated state, he managed to grab hold of the railings

But after sitting on the edge of the metal balcony instead of on the seat, he toppled over backward. 

Despite his inebriated state, he managed to grab hold of the railings, leaving himself dangling from the eighth floor.

His family had rushed over and tried to help him back up but he was far too heavy, and they were forced to call emergency services. 

Emergency services rescuer Cai Ku, 29, said: 'It was not possible to simply pull him back up, so we had to send one of our men over the edge and they fitted a harness on him'

He was then winched back up over the balcony to safety by members of the rescue team 

Rescuers said that when they carried him to the top he had staggered into the bedroom and instantly fallen asleep on the bed, probably from exhaustion and the alcohol

They held onto his arms to help stop him from falling until they arrived.
