The merciless Simpson Desert in central Australia claimed the life of a 25-year-old man who died from thirst – while his mate was found ‘just in time’ suffering from extreme dehydration.

Mauritz ‘Mo’ Pieterse and his friend, Josh Hayes, 30, had set out from a cattle station to check on a water spring when their four wheel drive became stuck in the sand.

It should have been a routine job lasting just a few hours before the men returned to the remote Ethabuka Station in north west Queensland.

Death in the desert: Mauritz Pieterse, 25, was found dead in the merciless Simpson Desert, Central Australia after setting out on a routine check of a water spring with his friend Josh Hayes

Unforgiving: The Simpson Desert in Australia is nearly 70,000 square miles of arid, sandy plains and dunes

When they failed to return by late afternoon, a number of workers – including Aboriginal trackers – set out into the darkness to look for them.

Close to midnight on a rough track, the headlights of a search vehicle driven by Greg Woods from another cattle station picked out the body of Mr Pieterse who had collapsed and perished from dehydration and exhaustion.

A short time later Mr Woods came across a highly distressed Mr Hayes.

‘It was about 11.30pm when I came across Mo’s body,’ said Mr Woods.

'I found Mo’s hat and shirt and car keys where he’d dropped them and I came across him a bit further down the track, but he was finished,’ he told Australian Associated Press.

‘I was more wild with him for doing it than I was bloody sad for him – I thought he had more bloody sense than that. But anyway, that’s the way it turned out.’

The two men, he said, made many mistakes but the worst was walking away from their vehicle in the blazing heat – temperatures can reach 50c in the middle of the day in the Simpson.

‘They were only bogged, they had plenty of fuel, they could have just sat there with the air conditioning going until somebody found them.’

After finding Mr Pieterse’s body, Mr Woods retraced his tracks and found Mr Hayes, who had been lying under a bush when he first drove past. He was close to death.

‘Another hour and he would have been gone, too. He was just bloody lucky he got through – he didn’t even have a hat to start with, but he had a massive head of hair and that might have helped him a bit.

‘He was well and truly perished. His eyes were like owl eyes, wide open and sunk in his head…you could see his heart beating out of his chest and he reckoned he couldn’t hear anything other than his heartbeat.’

Police constable Tim Farran, whose ‘patrol’ covers the region, said the two men were experienced in their work in the desert.

‘But this time it was just a series of small mistakes that led to one big one,’ he said.

‘The desert is a beautiful place and we do look at it through our windows and it looks really nice.

‘But just because it’s the 21st century and we have modern technology, don’t think it won’t kill.’

Later today the grief-stricken Pieterse family, who live in Western Australia, said they were planning to fly to rural Queensland and talk to those who had found their son.

‘He was the best son ever,’ said the dead man’s mother, Gerald, through her tears.

‘He was a gentle giant, the sort of kid who helped me even to do the ironing. He would hug you and was never shy to show his affection.’

Mrs Pieterse said her son loved his conservation work and that she trusted his judgement. 

‘We don’t know exactly what happened yet but we’re sure he would have made the right decision and looked after the other person he was with.’

Mr Pieterse’s younger sister Jani, and father, Tjokki, described his as a passionate and enthusiastic nature lover, dedicated to conservation.

Although Mr Pieterse would sometimes shoot animals that were causing problems or were injured.

Ethabuka Station is owned by the conservation group Bush Heritage Australia, which is helping regenerate the area after degradation caused by cattle and feral camels.

Mr David Whitelaw, spokesman for the group, said all staff were trained to work out in the desert and were provided with he equipment they needed.

‘This is a very tragic event,’ he told ABC radio.
