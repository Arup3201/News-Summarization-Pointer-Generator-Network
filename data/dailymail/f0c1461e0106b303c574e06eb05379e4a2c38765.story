A downhill mountain biker who careered into a young boy at high speed said he could have killed the child had he not been wearing a helmet.

Professional rider Nick Van Lier, 20, was hurtling down the dirt track at the Black Hill bike park in Ballarat when he suddenly noticed a young boy, aged about four or five, running across his path.

The quick thinking rider made very effort to avoid making contact with the child, who yelps on impact before his head makes solid impact with the ground.

The rider went in the wrong direction to avoid the boy and ended up hurtling into him at high speed

The boy braces for impact and Mr Van Lier turns his wheel at the last moment to avoid hitting him front-on

The young boy was running across the path when the quick thinking rider slammed on his brakes

Other screams can also be heard coming from a nearby child as the rider comes to a halt and rushes to the boy's aid.

The footage, taken from a camera mounted to the rider's helmet, was uploaded to YouTube where Mr Van Lier commented on the incident.

An experienced downhill racer, he wrote that he was travelling to fast to avoid the boy and had 'no doubt' that the child's helmet saved him from a serious head injury and possibly even death.

'I have no doubt that the little fella's helmet saved him some extensive head injuries, and possibly his life,' he said.

'The force of that impact, though reduced as best I could, would have easily been enough of a 'king hit', if he had not been wearing a helmet I dare say he'd be in a hospital or worse.ï»¿'

Mr Van Lier's YouTube channel is filled with videos of him riding along similar circuits to the Black Hill bike park, in Victoria - the track he was riding on when he hit the child.

He says he is a rider for Knolly Bikes, a brand of mountain bike specifically designed for downhill racing.

The boy was hit by the bike before being completely run over

Miraculously he escaped unhurt despite hitting his head hard on impact

The whole incident was over in less than five seconds from the time Mr Van Lier first noticed the boy

After letting out a yelp, the boy managed to pick himself up from the incident

Worried by the impact of the collision Nick Van Lier went to his aid to see if he was OK

Describing the event, Mr Van Lier said he was on a 'practice run' the day the incident happened and everything 'was going awesome' until he came to the top of the jump.

'Practice run was going awesome until I got over the top of this blind drop to find a small child standing on the landing,' he said.

'Unfortunately we both chose the same way to avoid each other, luckily he had a helmet on and was OK. Gave me a heart attack though!'

The video was originally uploaded to the social media site Reddit by user Otiotori.

'It's my buddy Nick he was out training for a race at a well signed and official mountain bike park,' the poster wrote.

'This is a VERY blind drop so Nick had no chance. You can (only) see the trail once you're airborne.'

Thankfully, both rider and boy escaped the incident unharmed.
