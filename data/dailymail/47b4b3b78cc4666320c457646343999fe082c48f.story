A transgender woman has had more than 100 black-market injections to achieve her 60-inch bum - despite her friends dying due to similar operations.

Tatiana Williams, 42, has spent £60,000 sculpting her body over the past 20 years - including injections that have filled each bum cheek with a incredible 8lb of silicone.

She said that similar high-risk illegal operations have maimed and killed a number of her friends, but that she has no regrets over her extensive plastic surgery.

Worth the risk: Tatiana Williams, 42, has has spent £60,000 sculpting her body over the past 20 years - including injections that have filled each bum cheek with a incredible 8lb of silicone

Ms Williams, who lives in Miami, Florida, has had breast enhancements, chin implants, facial fillers and laser surgery - all without visiting a licensed surgeon.

She said: 'Going to the black market is a big risk. People can die from these injections.'

'I've seen people eaten up by the silicone. I've seen them turn black-and-blue and not being able to walk anymore. 

'I've seen people have their whole breast taken off. I've seen everything.

'It's cheaper on the black market and people are willing to take the risks to achieve the beauty.

'I'm one of the lucky ones and I knock on wood everyday thanking God that he brought me through.' 

Illegal silicone injections often use non-surgical silicone - sometimes bought from hardware stores - that can lead to severe infections that result in deformations, amputations and even death.

But Ms Williams said that many people take the risk to follow in the footsteps of curvy celebrities.

She said: 'I love Kim Kardashian's body - it's beautiful. She's exactly what a woman should be.

'When it comes to me and celebrities, a lot of people compare me to Nicki Minaj.

'It makes me laugh because I'm thinking, 'I had a** before I even knew of Nicki or before she was even around'.

'Maybe Nicki's actually got an a** like me.'

Ms Williams, who was born Cory Williams, said she has always lived an unorthodox lifestyle but that her family have been supportive from the beginning.

She knew she was attracted to men from a young age before deciding to start living as a woman in her late teens. 

She said: 'My childhood was loving and respectful and so I was able to grow up into a positive and productive individual.

'I didn't have the same hang-ups as some of the people in the transgender community who were ostracised by family members.

Significant change: Ms Williams said that the risk of black-market surgeries has been worth it in order to achieve a curvier figure like those of celebrities Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj

'My family let me be who I wanted to be, so it gave me the opportunity to produce a beautiful woman with no hang-ups, mentally.'

Ms Williams first began her transition with hormone therapy, which helped her develop hips, breasts and a more feminine appearance.

But determined to be a 'body goddess', she was soon tempted by the quick-fix promises of backstreet surgery.

She said: 'It's pretty much word of mouth. People will go up to someone and say, "I like your body, where did you get it done?"

'It's really not hard to find. If you get into the right area, you'll pretty much find someone who is doing it.

Supported: Ms Williams (pictured aged 14, left, and aged 16, right), who was born Cory Williams, said she has always lived an unorthodox lifestyle but that her family have been supportive from the beginning

'I don't have a single friend who hasn't had something done.

'I've had countless surgeries. I got my injections done by three people. I won't say their names, but I went to Guadalajara in Mexico for some procedures and the rest were done here in Miami, Florida.'

Ms Williams saved up for breast enhancements, chin implants, facial fillers and laser surgery. 

But most of her money was spent on injections into her buttocks, which she would pay for every few months.

She said: 'Before the surgery my butt was about 25 inches - now it is more like 60 inches.

'It's hard to say how many injections I had - after a while you start to lose count.

'But I would have to say it must be something in the region of over a hundred...at least.' 

Happiest she has ever been: Ms Williams said that she has accepted she may one day pay a price for her curves but, for now, is determined to enjoy the life it has given her

Ms Williams said that she was once hospitalised for two weeks when a backstreet surgeon punctured her lung with a needle during a breast enhancement.

She now claims to live a life of luxury with her body attracting enough admirers to allow her to become a 'kept woman'.

She said: 'With a body like this, you pretty much get whatever you want. Men tend to put me up on a pedestal and treat me like a queen. 

'I'm not in a relationship but If I find the right man I'll go with it. But it's not that important to me.'

Despite having her pick of the men, Tatiana is often hurt by the frosty reception she gets from 'natural women' who are eager to dismiss her beauty.

'A lot of them can't accept a beautiful transgender woman,' she said.

'If you are a transvestite, a drag-queen or someone's that's playing around, they will receive you better. But if you're able to stand next to them and look just like them - or better - then it's different.

'It takes a strong woman to stand next to a transsexual woman like myself and not feel intimidated.'

In demand: Ms Williams claimed that her surgeries mean that her body attracts enough admirers that she can live a life of luxury as a 'kept woman', but said that 'natural women' find her beauty intimidating

One of Ms Williams' friends, Valencia Santiago, 39, said that others are now getting surgery to emulate Ms Williams' figure. 

She said: 'There is so much botched-up work going on out there. They want to copy Tatiana's look but end up looking rippled, dragging and sagging - it's ridiculous.'

Ms Williams has recently been assessed by leading plastic surgeon Dr Constantino Mendieta, who admits he is 'stunned' that she has had no issues with her black-market booty.

He said: 'Tatiana's shape is relatively good if you like the very, very big buttock look. 

'She must have had three or four thousand cc's of product, that's about 8 pounds, into each buttock.

'To me that's unbelievable. I have no clue how she has not had a problem.

'She falls into the one or two per cent of people who have not had problems yet.

Lucky: Plastic surgeon Dr Constantino Mendieta, pictured with Ms Williams, said that she has been very fortunate not to have suffered any medical complications as a result of her surgeries

'But the question is, what happens further down the road?'

When issues do flare up Dr Mendieta said that it usually begins with discolouration of the skin near the injection point.

This can then become inflamed, with itching and hardening. When the fat cells start to die, ulcers begin forming in the tissue. This can result in complete disfigurement as the filler spreads through the body.

Dr Mendieta said many victims end up 'medical cripples' and often it is too late to help them as the non-surgical silicone spreads throughout the body - rather than stay contained like an implant.

 He added: 'Even though Tatiana has not had any issues up to this point, I would urge people never, ever use these injections in your body. You are playing Russian Roulette.'

Ms Williams said that she has accepted she may one day pay a price for her curves but, for now, is determined to enjoy the life it has given her.

She said: 'It's been 20 plus years now and I'll accept whatever comes of it in the future,' she said.

'I don't recommend people copy what I did - but I'm a risk taker and it has been a success.

'I'm in the body I have created and enjoying the lifestyle it has afforded me.

'I have no regrets about being the beautiful woman I am.'
