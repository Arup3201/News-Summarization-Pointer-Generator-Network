A policeman has been killed and three civilians were injured after a bomb strapped to a donkey exploded at a police post in Afghanistan.

Local government spokesman Sarhadi Zwak says the animal blew up in front of the checkpoint in the Alingar district of Laghman province.

Mr Zwak said Taliban militants were responsible for the bomb, which was remotely detonated. Insurgents
are finding new ways to thwart stepped up security measures in their 
bid to undermine confidence in the Afghan government.

Horror: A policeman died when a bomb strapped to a donkey exploded in Laghman province. This picture shows the aftermath of another Taliban bomb attack yesterday in Farah province

Casualties: At least three people were injured in today's explosion. Here victims of yesterday's attack in Farah - when nine suicide bombers blew themselves up - receive medical treatment

Violence in the country has escalated as US and other 
foreign combat forces prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014.

Donkey bombs are uncommon in Afghanistan, although the militants are having to find increasingly bizarre ways to get explosives close to their intended targets.

Female suicide bombers are regularly used by the Taliban, with children even reportedly being trained to carry out attacks.

Today's incident comes after insurgents wearing Afghan army 
uniforms launched a suicide attack and stormed a courthouse in a failed 
bid to free Taliban inmates, killing at least 46 people.

Attack: Donkey bombs have been used before in Afghanistan. Pictured is the aftermath of an attack in Kandahar, south of Kabul, Afghanistan in 2008

The attack began when nine men wearing 
suicide vests drove into the capital of Farah province in western 
Afghanistan, evading checkpoints by using army vehicles, according to 
the provincial police chief.

The stand-off ended some eight hours later when the last gunman was killed.

In August 2012 a bomb strapped to a donkey exploded in Ghor 
Province, killing a senior policeman and injury three people.
