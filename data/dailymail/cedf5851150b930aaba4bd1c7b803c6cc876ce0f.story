City officials in San Francisco are to ban local government agencies from buying new Apple computers after the tech giant pulled out of a green certification scheme.

Apple last week announced it is withdrawing from a rating system used by governments and universities to assess how environmentally-friendly computers are.

The EPEAT - Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool - scheme identifies which electronic devices have the most impact on the environment.

The city of San Francisco has now responded by announcing it will no longer be buying Apple Mac devices for its 28,000 employees as it only purchase computers listed on the EPEAT registry.

The move is designed to encourage Apple to reconsider its decision to leave the scheme.

Jon Walton, San Francisco's chief information officer, said: 'San Francisco has reached out to Apple and is hopeful that a solution to this challenge can be found in the future.'

It is an embarrassing situation for the computer giant -  its headquarters are based just 40miles south of San Francisco in Cupertino and all its product launches take place in the northern California city, which is also home to many Apple staff.

An Apple spokesman revealed the company has no plans to backtrack on its decision, but did not reveal why it had pulled out in the first place.

Kristin Huguet said: 'Apple takes a comprehensive approach to measuring our environmental impact and all of our products meet the strictest energy efficiency standards backed by the U.S. government.

'We also lead the industry by reporting each product's greenhouse gas emissions on our website, and Apple products are superior in other important environmental areas not measured by EPEAT, such as removal of toxic materials.'

San Francisco officials spent a relatively meagre $45,579 (£29,293) on Apple products in 2010 - a tiny amount when compared to the tech firm's $65billion (£42billion) earnings that year.

The new ban does not apply to Apple's iPad or iPhone as the products do not fall under the EPEAT scheme's remit.

Ninety-five per cent of electronic devices bought by government agencies in the U.S.  must be certified under the EPEAT registry.

A spokesman for EPEAT said last week: 'We regret that Apple will no longer be registering its products in EPEAT. We hope that they will decide to do so again at some point in future.'

Apple's decision could result in an updated environmental measurement system, as EPEAT is several years old.
