Shamed U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong was at the head of an 'organized mafia and he literally tried to destroy people' and he 'belongs in jail.'

That's according to cycling great Greg LeMond, who gave a scathing critique of his sport's most recognizable athlete during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night.

According to LeMond, Armstrong would have been a 'top 30 at best' cyclist if not for his now-infamous doping regiment and he is 'not capable of winning the Tour de France' if not for the help of banned substances.

In 2012, Armstrong was banned from competitive cycling and he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles over his admitted use of performance enhancing drugs. Stripping Armstrong of his titles leaves LeMond as the only American to ever win the prestigious race.

After years of denials, Armstrong admitted in January that he had in fact used performance enhancing drugs during a much-hyped interview with Oprah Winfrey.

LeMond is one of the first people to suggest that Armstrong was using banned substances. In 2001, he questioned his relationship with Michele Ferrari, a doctor linked to several doping scandals.

In April, LeMond spoke at a symposium in Austin, Texas, where he told the crowd that he had 'no vendetta' against Armstrong and that 'I don't rejoice' in the fact that he was stripped of his Tour de France titles.

However, he was much more critical of Armstrong during his interview with Cooper.

When asked whether Armstrong perpetrated the biggest fraud in sports history, LeMond responded with 'Absolutely. Absolutely. The greatest fraud was that, I mean, I know his 
physical capabilities. He's a top 30 at best. I mean, at best. No matter
what. If he was clean and everybody else was clean, he's a top 30 at 
best. He's not capable of winning the Tour. He's not capable of the top 5.'

He went on to say that Armstrong's offenses are 'criminal' and that 'this is not a sporting infraction.'

'This was an organized mafia and he literally tried to destroy people,' LeMond said.

He went on to say that Armstrong belongs in jail.

Armstrong was at the center of a federal criminal fraud investigation until the Justice Department abandoned the investigation last year without an explanation.

However, there is still an open civil case against Armstrong claiming that he defrauded the U.S. Postal Service - his primary sponsor - out of $40 million. The USPS says it never would have sponsored Armstrong - or paid him the millions of dollars in sponsorship money - had it known he was using performance enhancing drugs.Â 

LeMond has won the Tour de France three times.
