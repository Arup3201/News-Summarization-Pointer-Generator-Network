It may be a la mode to create lighter versions of our favourite snacks but one company has taken the trend rather literally.

The world's first glow in the dark ice cream was handed out to a cinema audience who were surprised to find their snacks glowed a fluorescent yellow when the lights went out.

The film fanatics were treated to the inventive ice cream at the Vue Cinema in Leicester Square ahead of a screening of Simon Pegg's film The World's End.

Customers at the Vue Cinema in Leicester Square were surprised when their Cornettos lit up once the lights went out

The futuristic frozen treat has been developed for Wall's Ice Cream by food designers Bompas and Parr.

The sci-fi style snack appears to be nothing more than a normal mint Cornetto however once under UV lighting the sweet treat lights up in luminous colours.

According to Wall's this is a world first and means that cinema goers can avoid a sticky spillages as they are able to see what they're eating even in the dark.

Out of this world: The ice cream was developed by Bompas and Parr for Wall's Ice Cream

Wall's wanted to develop a frozen treat that customers would be able to see even in the dark

In order to create the gleaming gelato the ice cream is mixed with riboflavin which gives out a glow when under certain UV lights.

Despite the fact that mobile phones are banned in cinema theatres as the light they give out provides a distraction, Bompas and Parr insist that the ice creams won't create the same problem.

'The team at Cornetto wanted to make a cinema-based snack that you can eat and still see in the cinema without disrupting the film so we worked on it, and have come up with this ice cream, which is something we have been experimenting with for a long time.'

Bompas and Parr say that despite their bright glow the ice creams shouldn't distract from the film

The team at Bompas have since been developing further glow in the dark desserts using luciferin enzymes from genetically modified bacteria.

'This is something quite special,' Bompas told Dezeen magazine 'Using the same enzyme that fireflies and jellyfish use to fluoresce - that we use to make a fancy sauce for the dessert.'

Although a fluorescent pudd may seem anything other than natural the team insist that it is a completely wholesome process...sort of, saying: 'It's totally organic and natural, if you're okay with genetically modified organisms.'
