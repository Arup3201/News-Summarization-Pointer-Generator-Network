When four-year-old Chad Carr fell over on his nose, his mother took him to the hospital as a precaution to check whether he had a concussion.

However, following an MRI, Tammi Curtis Carr was hit with the worst news she could have imagined - her son had an inoperable brain tumor. 

The mother-of-three from Ann Arbor, Michigan, was given the horrifying news on Tuesday that her son, Chad, had the mass on his brain stem.  

Chad Carr (pictured in his hospital bed yesterday for his fourth birthday) has been diagnosed with a rare brain tumor, with a survival rate of between nine and 12 months 

His family are now hoping for a miracle as Chad (bottom middle) prepares to start his treatment for the tumor

His mother initially took him to the hospital as a precaution when he fell onto his nose at their home in Ann Arbor, Michigan 

According to Fox News, the youngster was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare brain tumor that primarily affects children. Once diagnosed, the average rate of survival is nine to twelve months.

He will star aggressive radiotherapy at the Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor on Monday, but his family are now hoping for a miracle. 

Mrs Carr has now taken to social media hoping the power of prayer can heal her boy.

She posted a message on her Facebook on Thursday saying: 'We now need prayers and it's my hope that this goes viral and millions fall in love with (Chad) and send him prayers,' she wrote. 'It's going to take a miracle and I believe it can happen and I hope you will help and spread his story!'

On his birthday, the family tweeted a picture of their son in his hospital bed with the caption, 'Happy 4th Birthday to our beautiful little boy. Here's to many more. #chadtough.' 

Since his diagnosis, he has also been to visit members of the University of Michigan football team while players from the Detroit Tigers showed their support on Twitter pictures. 

Today he travelled to be honorary captain for the Michigan Wolverines at their home, The Big House.
