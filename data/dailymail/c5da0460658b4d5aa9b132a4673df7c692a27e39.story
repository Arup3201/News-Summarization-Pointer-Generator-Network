Baby Gammy and his mother have moved into a new house paid for using part of the $250,000 raised for his family through public donations.

About half of the money raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, leaving $120,000 to cover 10-month-old Gammy's future medical and living expenses, said charity Hands Across The Water.

Charity founder Peter Baines said the family needed a new home because their previous one-bedroom unit was too run-down for Gammy, who still suffers from a lung condition.

Baby Gammy and his mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua moved into a new house, 100km south of Bangkok

Almost half of the $250,00 raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, where the pair will live with Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children

'He was recently back in hospital for six days prior to them moving into house,' Mr Baines told Daily Mail Australia.

'We took advice from Down Syndrome Australia who said the environmental conditions of where the kids live are important.

'They're more susceptible to illness, colds, and virus than children who do not have Down syndrome so they need to live in a cleaner, healthier environment that's why we were keen to see them moved.'

Earlier this year Goy and Gammy found themselves at the centre of an international row over the ethics and legality of surrogacy when it emerged Gammy's Australian parents David and Wendy Farnell abandoned him in Thailand but took home his healthy twin sister Pipah. 

 Before moving into the new home Gammy was in hospital for six days due to a lung infection

Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of  Pipah, the West Australian reported.

Pipah recently returned to Australia after a trip to China with Mrs Farnell for her mother's funeral.

WA Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said officers have yet to make a decision about whether she can stay in the care of her father David Farnell, a convicted child sex offender.

'The department was fully aware of her travel and was supportive of her taking time to grieve and spend time with her family,' Ms Morton told the West Australian.

'While this specific case is still subject to an ongoing thorough assessment, I can assure you that much has happened behind the scenes.'

The house for Gammy's family was purchased and is being held under a trust in the name of Hands Across The Water, which is managing the family's money on behalf of his Thai surrogate mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua.

'This way we guarantee the safety of the house so the family can't sell it or use it for any means that are inappropriate,' Mr Baines said.

Gammy, Goy, and Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children moved into the home earlier this month.

Mr Baines said Gammy was now much healthier and has gained a lot of weight.

He added that the family plans to do some alterations at the front of the house to set up a noodle shop, similar to the one at the front of Goy's grandparents' house where Gammy sometimes stayed.

Mr Baines described Gammy as: 'a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life'

'That's not out of necessity, because we're paying them more than enough in a monthly allowance,' he said.

'It's just a way for Goy to be productive and earn an income.'

The house is in the same neighbourhood as the family's previous residence, in an industrial area about 100km south of Bangkok, where they also ran a small shop selling salads and noodles.

Mr Baines said $250,000 was raised for Gammy through the Go Fund Me website, but the company took $10,000 in fees.

'We made approaches and asked if they could discount that and they said no,' he said.

Three people, who wish to remain anonymous, originally set up the Go Fund Me page to raise $25,000 for Gammy.

Media outlets picked up the details of that fund when the story started gaining worldwide media attention, and when the amount of money donated became too much for them to handle they asked Hands Across The Water took step in and manage it.  

Mr Baines said: 'we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood'

Earlier in the year, Hands Across The Water administered $20,000 towards Gammy's medical costs, including moving him from a public to a private hospital, when he was suffering from a lung infection
