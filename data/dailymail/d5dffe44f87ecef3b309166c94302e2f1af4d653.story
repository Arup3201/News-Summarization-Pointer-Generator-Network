A Romanian visited his holiday home only to find a completely empty plot of land with a field of corn planted in its place after his house had been stolen by thieves.

Police in the Romanian port city of Braila got a call from Andy Pascali, 40, complaining that his holiday house on the Danube Delta had been stolen.

At first they thought it was a joke, but when they turned up at the nearby village of Baldovinesti they found not only that there was no property where there should have been a three-bedroom building, but that a field of ready-to-harvest corn had been planted in its place.

After: The cornfield planted by a neighbour where Mr Pascali's house should have been before it was stolen

Police thought someone was playing a prank when they first received a call about the house being stolen

A shocked Mr Pascali, who posted the image of the cornfield on his Facebook page, said: 'I think this could only happen in Romania.

'My entire house has been stolen and my neighbours have taken advantage of the opportunity to plant a field of corn instead. Absolutely incredible.'

He said the theft should be a warning to anybody who might be thinking about buying a holiday home in the country that they should make regular checks to make sure it was still there.

He added: 'My message is to anyone with a holiday home in Romania is this, it could happen to you to!'

He said that he believed the crooks had probably managed to recycle just about everything after slowly taking the house apart while he was not there.

He said the property that he had inherited from his parents who had built it in 1986 had also been fully furnished with a brand-new fitted kitchen and bathroom.

He added: 'I had been worried about thieves maybe breaking in and stealing the television or something, and so I put a barbed wire fence up around the house for added security. But they stole that as well.'

The man from the capital Bucharest had been looking forward to enjoying a break after the house was finally complete and landscape gardeners had finished putting down the lawn.

They had even installed a pond with a fountain, which had also vanished when Andy turned up for his holiday.

A local man admitted he decided to take advantage of the fact that the ground was no longer being used to plant a field of corn but denied knowing anything about the theft of the house in the first place.
