Hotel guests tempted to slyly tuck away couple of fluffy white towels into their suitcases are not alone.

Nearly half (43 per cent) of British holidaymakers admit to thieving from their rooms, with 60 per cent of those people not considering it to be stealing, according to a survey.

Twelve per cent said they took items because they felt that the hotel wasn't offering them value for money, while 15 per cent admitted to pinching things because they didn't think they'd get caught.

Hotel guests that confessed to stealing items from hotel rooms most frequently said they did so because they believed it was expected of them, the survey of 1,000 people revealed. 

Of the guests who said they didn't steal, 35 per cent said there was because there was nothing they wanted, and 7 per cent were afraid of getting caught.

Despite 16 per cent of holidaymakers saying would not take items because it set a bad example to children, those  with kids were just as likely as those without  to take things from hotels.

Men were slightly more likely than women to steal things from hotels with 45 per cent admitting foul-play as opposed to 43 per cent of females.

Fifteen per cent of those who stole items such as hotel towels thought that they wouldn't get caught

But the largest group prepared to admit their pilfering ways were young people, with 47 per cent of 18-34-year-olds saying they stole from hotels, compared to 45 per cent of 35-54-year-olds and 37 per cent of those aged over 55.

Mark Byart, Director of Internet for Just the Flight, which commissioned the study, said: 'The survey shows Britons aren't always sure about what they can and can't take.

'Some hotels are happy for you to take mementos home, but others run on very tight margins and would rather not see extra toiletries going missing.

'Some hotels already have price lists for in-room items such as dressing gowns and towels - being upfront with guests can only improve their hotel experience.'
