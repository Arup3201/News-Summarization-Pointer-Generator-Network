A top Tory official who allegedly spent taxpayers' money on a hotel room used for a sex party has been removed from a list of candidates to become an MP, it emerged today.

Iain Corby, who is being investigated by Parliament's expenses watchdog, has been struck off the list of candidates approved by Conservative Central Office.

It follows the publication of a series of embarrassing messages the official exchanged with another man on Grindr, a gay dating app.

Partying: Details of salacious messages sent by a top Tory official on a gay dating service were revealed last week. The exchanges involved Tory official Iain Corby (pictured, left, with an unidentified man)

They refer to ‘cute boys’, ‘orgy’, 
‘gay party’, ‘hottie MPs’ and ‘all in one bed’ said to be ‘on offer’ in a
 luxury hotel suite hired for Tory researchers at the party’s annual 
conference in Manchester.

The messages name two top Tory MPs: one of the most senior Government Ministers and an MP tipped as a future Party leader.

It is claimed the exchanges were one of 
the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based 
Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for  by MPs via 
taxpayer-funded expenses.

Each Tory MP pays the PRU £4,000 a year for research services. The MPs claim it back from IPSA as an expense.

Insiders say there was near panic at 10 Downing Street when the Grindr messages were reported to David Cameron last month.

He ordered an urgent investigation, which led to Mr Corby’s departure in an attempt to limit the damage.

The ‘sex party’ on MPs’ expenses 
at Manchester’s Light ApartHotel, where rooms cost up to £2,500 a night,
 was first revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week.

The body 
responsible for MPs’ expenses and pay, the Independent Parliamentary 
Standards Authority (IPSA), is now investigating the hotel 'sex party'.

IPSA rules state 'staffing expenditure 
may not be claimed for any party political activity.' Nor can MPs claim 
expenses for 'attendance at political party conferences'.

The Independent reported that Downing 
Street and Tory whips were made aware of complaints against Mr Corby 
before his resignation and the publication of the Grindr conversations.

Aspiring
 Tory MPs have to pass a series of tests before they are eligible to put
 themselves forward. The final decision on which candidate to select is 
down to local party activists.

Mr Corby could not be reached for 
comment, and a spokesman for the Tory party declined to comment.

Iain Corby testified at the trial of Nigel Evans, the former Deputy Speaker, after being one of several senior Tory Conservative Party figures who were approached in 2009 by a young Tory researcher.

The researcher claimed the former Deputy Speaker acted improperly however, Mr Evans was cleared of all charges last week.

Despite this, the trial exposed a culture of excessive drinking between some MPs and young maleresearchers in Parliamentary bars.

Former Deputy Speaker: Nigel Evans said innocent people who are 'dragged through the courts' should not face 'financial ruin' after he was cleared of a string of sex assaults

Mr
 Corby told the court in his evidence last month that he spoke to the 
researcher in a meeting following an incident involving Mr Evans when 
they had been staying together.

'What I did think is that Nigel would be a lot happier coming out of the closet'

He said: ‘I think the question was “do you really want Nigel’s career to end because of this” and I think very quickly (the alleged victim) backtracked from that.’

Mr Corby said he got the impression that the complainant was ‘happy’ once he was assured Evans would be asked to apologise and warned about his drinking.

Mr Corby also said he been encouraging Mr Evans to come out as gay before he did, adding: ‘What I did think is that Nigel would be a lot happier coming out of the closet.’

Mr Corby, head of the Policy Research Unit which works for Tory MPs, stood down from his roleearlier this month.
