Barcelona still look set to part company with coach Luis Enrique, despite winning 5-0 in midweek, and former Brighton manager Oscar Garcia is the surprise name on a list of possible replacements.

Catalan television reported last night that Barca president Josep Bartomeu had met Leo Messi, made it clear he sided with him in his fall-out with Luis Enrique, and was already looking to replace the 44-year-old coach.

Finding a new manager could be problematic because any new appointment would only be offered a short-term contract due to elections that have been called for the end of the season and that makes Garcia one of the candidates.

Garcia narrowly missed out on taking Brighton to the Premier League in 2013 and is a former Barcelona player, who has worked at the club as a youth team coach, taking the Under 19 side to an unprecedented treble in 2011.

He turned down the chance to replace Andoni Zubizarreta as sporting director earlier this week because he wants his next job to be in management and he would fit the profile of a coach who knows the club and is available.

Despite the Copa del Rey victory over Elche, watched by only 27,000, Barcelona go into their important home game against Atletico Madrid tomorrow with Enrique on the brink. 

He feels he neither has the backing of the dressing room nor the president, who this week referred to Messi as ‘leader’ of the club.
