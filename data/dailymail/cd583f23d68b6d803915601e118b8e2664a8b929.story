Diego Forlan has become the latest Uruguay player to stick the knife into England following their 2-1 victory at the World Cup - by claiming that the Three Lions were 'afraid' of team-mate Luis Suarez.

Liverpool striker Suarez punished two English defensive mistakes to bag a brace and knock Roy Hodgson's men out of the World Cup in Brazil after only two matches.

And Forlan believes that England's players approached the game nervous as they knew what the 27-year-old was capable of having seen him score 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season.

Speaking to ESPN, Forlan said: 'He got three good chances.

'The first, he scored. The second one, he hit wide. A fit Luis would have scored that.

'And the third one, he scored to win the game. He never stopped fighting.

'That's Luis, he's never changed, not since I first saw him as a 17-year-old.

'I think England were afraid of him because they knew what he's done while playing in England.'

What makes Suarez's feat more impressive was his admission that he was only '50 per cent fit'.

The striker now has 41 goals in 78 appearances for Uruguay and will be hoping to fire La Celeste into the last-16.

They face Italy in their final Group D match on Tuesday knowing that they must win to progress due to their inferior goal difference.

England have been eliminated but must play Costa Rica in a dead rubber match.
