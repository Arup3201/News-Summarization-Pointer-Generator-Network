Andy Murray, pictured outside 10 Downing Street after winning Wimbledon this year, could lose £500,000 due to a planning setback

He can't seem to stop winning on the court, but Andy Murray has suffered a blow off it after it emerged he is set to lose £500,000 because of botched investment plans in a new Surrey golf course.

The tennis star, who won Wimbledon this summer and is currently competing in the US Open championships he triumphed at last year, invested the money for the planned course and spa at Cherkley Court in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Beaverbrook Golf Club would have been the 141st course in the county, where Murray lives with his girlfriend, Kim Sears, but 10 days ago a High Court judge quashed the planning permission granted to developers Longshot Ltd, according to The Independent.

The firm must now restore the course site to its original condition, unless it lodges a successful appeal.

The cost, thought to be hundreds of thousands, will be added to legal costs and loss of income if the course is not built.

Despite the potential loss, Murray, who reached the third round of the US Open last night, is not short of cash. Winning Wimbledon added a cool £1.6million to his near-£30million career prize money, while the allure of working with Britain's first SW19 champion since 1936 has proved too much for sponsors, which now include Rado, Adidas and the Royal Bank of Scotland.

And last year it was revealed the Scot had invested in a rambling hotel in his native Dunblane.

Another who could potentially lose out on the failed golf course project is advertising mogul Sir Frank Lowe, who invested £250,000, which planned to turn the home of the late press baron Lord Beaverbrook, Cherkley Court near Leatherhead, into a hotel and spa, with the golf course.

But another major loser will be the unique chalklands of the Leatherhead Downs, which some feel may never recover from the damage already done.

Mole Valley District Council allowed the project last year against the advice of its planning officers and warnings from environmental experts. Local campaigners challenged the decision in the High Court and won.

Mr Justice Haddon-Cave found the council’s decision to grant planning permission on such an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty was perverse, and that the council had 'erred in law'.

The requirement to restore the site arises because Longshot decided to carry on as if its planning permission were unassailable, and cleared meadows. Environmental law specialist Richard Buxton, for the campaigners, obtained legal undertakings from Longshot to undo any damage if it lost.

'It is particularly gratifying having the court so explicitly recognising that what may be profitable for developers is not necessarily in the public interest,' he said.

Murray, in winning action at the US Open last night, has had little to scowl about on the court in the last year, winning Wimbledon, last year's US Open and the Olympics

Longshot said it  was 'amazed' and 'appalled' at the ruling. The judge denied leave to appeal, but the firm is expected to try anyway.

Professor David Hawksworth CBE, a former Council of English Nature member and a local resident, said there should have been no 'physical disturbance or spraying' without 'scientific assessment' of the site by skilled specialists.

John Northcott, portfolio holder of planning at Mole Valley District Council, said: 'We will now need to take time to consider what our next steps will be.'
