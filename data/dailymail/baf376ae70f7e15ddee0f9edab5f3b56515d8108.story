The Argentine ambassador in London has accused the UK of violating international law in its 'arrogant' approach to the case of Julian Assange.

Alicia Castro, who only took up her post earlier this year, said the diplomatic handling of attempts to extradite the Wikileaks founder showed similarities to the UK's attitude to the Falkland Islands.

A former air stewardess and union official, Ms Castro is known for her nationalistic stance and is a close confidante of President Cristina Kirchner.

Speaking of the Assange case in an interview with an Argentine radio station, she said: 'For us Argentines, this fact [sic], that shows us the arrogance of British diplomacy, does not surprise us.

'It is very similar to the approach taken toward the Malvinas Islands [the Argentine name for the Falklands]. London is being urged by the United Nations to negotiate and participate in dialogue with Argentina.'

Ms Castro added that by allegedly threatening to seize Assange from Ecuador's London embassy, the UK was 'violating international law' and said the Organisation of American States had joined together to 'defend international law against the British challenge.'

A diplomatic row developed between the UK and Ecuador after the South American nation granted asylum to Mr Assange, who faces extradition to Sweden to face trial over alleged sexual offences.

He denies any wrongdoing and took refuge in Ecuador's embassy, saying he fears being extradited to the US in connection with the publication of leaked diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.

William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, has said the UK is 'determined to carry out our legal obligation' to have Assange extradited to Sweden.

Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador, accused the UK of indicating it would enter Ecuador's embassy to arrest Assange but later said the UK had 'given up on its threat'.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said Assange would be arrested if he left the embassy but insisted that no threats have been made against the embassy.

Ms Castro also revealed that she met Assange at the embassy with other Latin American leaders last Friday while listening to a live transmission from Washington of a meeting of foreign ministers from the OAS to discuss the inviolability of embassy and consular premises.

'We were sitting looking at the debate when Assange turned up and shook hands with all the ambassadors and diplomatic representatives and stayed on for quite some time,' she said.

'He talked with several of us while following the OAS debate.'

Argentina had left the post of ambassador to the UK vacant since 2008 before Ms Castro's arrival in London in March in protest at the UK's refusal to be drawn into discussions over the sovereignty of the Falklands.
