A woman has been charged over an alleged theft from a charity fund set up in the memory of crash victim Laura Rees.

Natalie Thomas, 25, was charged with theft last week and is due to appear at Llanelli Magistratesâ€™ Court in Wales.

Friend Laura was killed in a head-on car crash in October 2012 as she went to visit her best friend shortly before the friend was due to get married.

Laura, who 
was supposed to be a bridesmaid at the wedding, died just hours after 
she had picked up her dress and got her nails done ahead of her friend's
 big day.

The
 nursery worker, who was buried in her bridesmaid dress, was due to 
spend the night at the bride's house to discuss plans for the wedding.

A
 statement from Miss Rees's mother Angela was read out last Friday at 
the inquest into her death at Llanelli Town Hall in Carmarthenshire.

She told police her daughter had enjoyed a 'leisurely 'me' day' before her death in October last year.

She worked at the Glangwili Day Nursery in Carmarthen and was a former barmaid at the Black Lion Hotel in St Clears.

After Laura's death, Thomas set up a fund to raise money towards building a new children's medical centre at Glangwili along with Laura's family.

A Dyfed-Powys Police spokeswoman said: 'A 25 year old female has been charged with theft'.

She will appear at magistrates' court later this month.

Laura died after a head-on collision on this road in South Wales. She was on her way to see her bride-to-be friend after picking up her bridesmaid dress
