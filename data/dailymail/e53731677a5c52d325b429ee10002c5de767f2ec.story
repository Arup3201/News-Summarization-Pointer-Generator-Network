A groomsman at an Ohio wedding has been arrested for stealing thousands of dollars worth of cash and gift-cards from the newlyweds as they partied with family and friends at their wedding reception.

Noah Howard, 29, allegedly stole 55 unopened wedding cards containing a total of $6,800 in cash and gift-cards from a safe at the reception venue - and then went back to celebrate some more with the bride and groom.

The theft was discovered after an employee at the Webster Street Market, the reception venue, noticed the cards missing from the safe.

Friend indeed: Groomsman Noah Howard allegedly stole $6,800 worth of cash and giftcards from the bride and groom whose wedding he had just taken part in before returning to the reception to party with the newlyweds

According to ABC News, Howard had asked staff if he could change clothes in the office.

After the employee discovered the empty safe, the police were called.

Before they could arrive, though, the cards were recovered in a Men's Warehouse garment bag that Howard had stashed behind some bushes near the entrance to the venue.

Howard told police the money must have been placed in the bag by an employee who tried to steal the cards and then became scared and dumped them in Howard's bag.

Joyful occasion: The bride and groom were celebrating their wedding at the Webster Street Market with their nearest and dearest when Howard went to an office to change and emerged with a garment back of cards

AJC reports that surveillance footage shows Howard enter the venue's office to change and then emerge holding the garment bag and swaying as he walked.

“It’s just a very extreme thing to do, to take gifts at a wedding,” Mire said, adding he does not know if Howard has financial problems.

Howard was booked into the Dayton county jail on suspicion of theft.

According to the New York Daily News, Howard has known the groom for 12 years.

Police are waiting for the newlyweds to return from their honeymoon before they can complete the investigation.
