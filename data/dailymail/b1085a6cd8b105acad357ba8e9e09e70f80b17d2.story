Iran cut off oil sales to British companies yesterday after Foreign Secretary William Hague accused the Islamist regime of promoting terrorism.

The oil ministry in Tehran announced that it had ceased all sales to the UK and France, escalating diplomatic tensions triggered by Iran’s nuclear programme.

The move will have little effect on British firms, which get well under  1 per cent of their oil from Iran since the European Union has already slapped sanctions on the country and has vowed to stop buying all Iranian oil by July. Iran was supplying more than 700,000 barrels a day to the EU last year but this had already been cut back by 300,000 before yesterday’s move.

Diplomacy: William Hague has warned Israel today that military action against Iran would not be 'a wise thing'

Nevertheless it represented another ratcheting up of tensions.

The action came less than 48 hours after Mr Hague accused Iran of threatening a new nuclear Cold War in the Middle East. Yesterday the Foreign Secretary accused the government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of plotting terrorist outrages around the world. He said there was ‘no specific information’ about a threat to the London Olympics from any Tehran-backed terrorists.

In a further escalation of rhetoric, Iran’s state-run news agency suggested the country was capable of sinking British warships in the Gulf.

In a report published yesterday, it said it was ‘Britain that would suffer unwelcome consequences if it joins its mentors in the U.S. and the Israeli regime to attack Iran’.

Alireza Nikzad, a spokesman for the oil ministry said: 'Exporting crude to British and French companies has been stopped ... we will sell our oil to new customers.'

The decision comes after European Union member states had agreed to stop importing Iranian crude from July.

The agreement was intended to pressure Iran to stop enriching uranium over increasing concerns of its nuclear programme.

In an interview with BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show, the Foreign Secretary repeated his warning that a nuclear-armed Iran would result in another cold war in the Middle East.

'They would either be attacked and there would be a war, or there would be a cold war in which Iran for the long term would be subject to these very intense economic sanctions and they would find that other nations in their region developed nuclear weapons,' he said.

But he urged against military action, although he said it was not ruled out as an option.

'I don’t think a wise thing at this moment is for Israel to launch a military attack on Iran,' he said.

'I
think Israel like everyone else in the world should be giving a real 
chance to the approach we have adopted on very serious economic 
sanctions and economic pressure and the readiness to negotiate with 
Iran.

'That’s what we need to make a success of.'

Mr Hague said Israel did not share its plans with Britain.

'We do not take any options off the table, we don’t know how the situation will develop, it would be unwise to do that,' he said.

'But our approach is 100 per cent diplomatically and economically focused to bring Iran to the negotiating table.'

The United States also pushed Israel not 
to strike Iran, with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Martin Dempsey leading 
the American call for restraint.

Mr Hague said there was 'no specific information' about a threat to the London Olympics from any Tehran-backed terrorists.

But he acknowledged: 'Clearly Iran has been involved increasingly in illegal and potentially terrorist activity in other parts of the world.

'I think Iran has increased its willingness to contemplate utterly illegal activities in other parts of the world. This is part of the danger that Iran is presenting to the peace of the world.'

Developments: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad watches from a control room as nuclear fuel rods are loaded into the Tehran Research Reactor on Wednesday

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas 
Alexander called for 'calm heads and clear thinking', but said Iran 
needed to feel the international community’s 'full force'.

He
told Sky News’ Murnaghan programme: 'The right approach at this stage 
is to push forward the twin-track approach: on the one hand offering 
genuine engagement, on the other hand tightening the peaceful pressure, 
strengthening the sanctions that are being felt at the moment.

'When the international community says, "All options need to be left on the table", I agree.

Mr Alexander said the Government should focus not on 'raising the rhetoric, but on redoubling their efforts to secure a diplomatic and peaceful outcome'.

Diplomats also warned today that Iran is poised to greatly expand uranium enrichment at a fortified underground bunker to a point that would boost how quickly it could make nuclear warheads.

They said Tehran had put finishing touches for the installation of thousands of new-generation centrifuges at the cavernous bunker - machines that can produce enriched uranium much more quickly and efficiently than its present machines.

While saying that the electrical circuitry, piping and supporting equipment for the new centrifuges was now in place, the diplomats emphasised that Tehran had not started installing the new machines at its Fordo facility and could not say whether it was planning to.

Still, the senior diplomats - who asked for anonymity because their information was privileged - suggested that Tehran would have little reason to prepare the ground for the better centrifuges unless it planned to operate them.

They spoke in recent interviews - the last one yesterday.

The reported work at Fordo appeared to reflect Iran’s determination to forge ahead with nuclear activity that could be used to make atomic arms despite rapidly escalating international sanctions and the latent threat of an Israeli military strike on its nuclear facilities.

Fordo could be used to make fissile warhead material even without such an upgrade, the diplomats said.

They said that although older than Iran’s new generation machines, the centrifuges now operating there can be reconfigured within days to make such material because they already are enriching to 20 per cent - a level that can be boosted quickly to weapons-grade quality.

Their comments appeared to represent the first time anyone had quantified the time it would take to reconfigure the Fordo centrifuges into machines making weapons-grade material.

In contrast, Iran’s older enrichment site at Natanz is producing uranium at 3.4 per cent, a level normally used to power reactors. While that too could be turned into weapons-grade uranium, reassembling from low to weapons-grade production is complex, and retooling the thousands of centrifuges at Natanz would probably take weeks.

The diplomats’ comments come as International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors are due to visit Tehran today.

Their trip - the second this month - is another attempt to break more than three years of Iranian stonewalling about claims that it has - or is - secretly working on nuclear weapons that would be armed with uranium enriched to 90 per cent or more.

Iran says it is enriching only to make nuclear fuel. But because enrichment can also create fissile warhead material, the United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions on Tehran in a failed attempt to force it to stop.

More recently, the US, the European Union and other Western allies have either tightened up their own sanctions or rapidly put new penalties in place striking at the heart of Iran’s oil exports lifeline and its financial system.

The most recent squeeze on Iran was announced on Friday, when Brussels-based Swift, a financial clearing house used by virtually every country and major corporation in the world, agreed to shut out the Islamic Republic from its network.
