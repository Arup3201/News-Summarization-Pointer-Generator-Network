Twin brothers decided that the new year was a time for a new start when they used their YouTube channel to come out to their father.

L.A.-based models Aaron and Austin Rhodes - known on YouTube as The Rhodes Bros - posted a video to their channel in which they discussed the decision to come out.

The 19-year-olds then called their father, who lives in Ohio.

The powerful video, punctuated by tearful pauses from both twins as they break the news to their father, has now been viewed 2.4 million times.

In the video, Aaron explained that there is something they want to tell him that is going to be on YouTube soon, and with his voice cracking he said: 'I'm gay and... Austin is too.'

The man behind the phone call - Aaron Rhodes pictured with his father who told his sons: 'You know I love you both, and that will never change'.

A tearful Austin said: 'I just didn't want you to find out through YouTube and I just wanted to be able to have that conversation, because I feel like we're close enough, and I finally feel like I'm at that point now where I'm able to tell you, and I just want to be able to have you behind us 100 per cent.'

'I just don't want you to not love us anymore,' he added.

Their supportive father responded: 'You know I love you both and that will never change.'

The highly emotional YouTube video of the Rhodes twins coming out to their father has been viewed more the 2.4 million times since its release on Wednesday

 Despite their fears, their father proved to be very supportive and described how he had become a more accepting person through his experiences at work

'You have to live your lives and you gotta do what you gotta do.'

He spoke about being from a very different generation, but that the job he had been doing for many years has made him a much more accepting person.

He also reminded the twins that he had been abandoned by his own father, but said: 'I can't undo being your dad.'

The handsome twin brothers live in Los Angeles, California, and are both pursuing modelling careers

Both brothers have built up a sizable social media following on Instagram, YouTube and Twitter in the six months leading up to the release of the video

'I'm not going to sit here and say: "you're not"; or "why?"; or try to say "change!"' he added. 'It is what it is, you know, you're living your lives, and that's all you can do in life – live it.'

After the call, having taken time to compose themselves, the twins returned with an upbeat message for the new year.

'Our message moving forward from all of this, and with this video, is just to be yourself.'

Austin Rhodes posted this photo to his Instagram account on January 1, less than two weeks before he and his brother made their emotional YouTube video

The brothers had already generated a sizable social media following through their YouTube, Twitter and Instagram accounts in the six months leading up to release of the video.

They hope their video will be an inspiration to others. 

Said Austin at the end of the video: 'Here's to 2015!'
