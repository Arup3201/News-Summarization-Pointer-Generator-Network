The doors of New York's iconic Studio 54 gave way to a dark world of sex, drugs and alcohol-fuelled celebrities, a former owner's memoirs have revealed. 

The behind-the-scenes documents, which tell the 'true story' of the popular Manhattan club, were written by Mark Fleischman, who bought the venue from its founders in 1981.

They reveal how the disco was the 'epicenter of New York's drug culture', with stars often gathering in Mr Fleischman's office, where an employee was specifically hired to cut lines of white powder.

They also claim that the club had an 'ongoing' sex and high-end partying culture that was so popular that Michael Jackson would often retreat into the DJ booth to dance away from other guests.

It comes as co-founder Ian Schrager, who first launched Studio 54 in 1977 with Steve Rubell, is planning to release a Rizzoli coffee-table book on the club in the fall of 2015.

Speaking of his memoirs, collectively named 'The Studio 54 Effect', Mr Fleischman said: 'Steve died in 1989 and Ian appears to be sanitizing what occurred. My book is the true story about Studio 54.'

The former owner said he relaunched the club with an aim of 'entertaining the biggest stars of the world with Champagne and cocaine', including John Belushi, Keith Richards and Andy Warhol. 

In his memoirs, he reveals how celebrities used to watch an employee - 'a very pretty girl' - chop up to 40 'perfect' lines of cocaine alongside Champagne in his office, the New York Post reported.

'There were so many people at a long desk, you needed 30 or 40 lines of coke,' he writes. 'That takes a long time. You don't want to make them uneven.'

Mr Fleischman, who counted Rick James as his 'best friend' at the time, adds that while Jackson would dance in the DJ booth, U.S. fashion designer Halston would use it to do drugs out of sight.

The memoirs also reveal that at 5am, a group dubbed 'the Dawn Patrol' - including Robin Williams, Dodi Fayed and Christoper Reeve - would climb into a limousine provided by the owner.

Then, they would head to an after-hours venue in the Meatpacking District, where they would continue partying 'until noon', they said.

Guests at Studio 54 were greeted by famed New York City doorman Haoui Montaug, while performers at the club included Madonna, Wham!, Duran Duran, Cyndi Lauper and Lime.

Other celebrities spotted at the venue included Woody Allen, Rod Stewart, Dolly Parton, Olivia Newton-John, Bianca Jagger and producer Allan Carr.

Mr Fleischman, who bought the disco when Mr Schrager and Mr Rubell were serving time for tax evasion, said he 'crashed' after selling it in April 1986.

In subsequent years, he attended rehab, before venturing to a spiritual mountain in Baja, California, where he said he 'gained redemption'.

He then started reinventing himself in the night club industry, opening more American clubs and restaurants. Today, he owns Bar Method exercise studios in Los Angeles. 

But despite his new venture, he still says: 'I miss Rick and the old times at Studio 54.'
