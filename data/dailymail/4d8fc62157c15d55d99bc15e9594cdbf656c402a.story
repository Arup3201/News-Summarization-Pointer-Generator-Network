A football fan enamoured with Manchester United has had the club's red and yellow badge tattooed permanently onto his forehead.

Formerly called Zdravkov Levidzhov, the 50-year-old builder has also changed his name to Manchester United after having spent 10 years trying to convince courts to accept the amendment.

While tattoos of football club badges are not unheard of, the prominent position of the Bulgarian's ink means he has been attracting plenty of attention.

It took 15 court hearings before Zdravko Levidjov was allowed to change his name to Manchester United

Mr United has even named his pet cat after David Beckham - his favourite player

Mr United told The Sun the tattoo acted like his own unique ID.

He said: 'People don't look at me in a funny way, they look at me in admiration.

'It makes me stand out and proves my loyalty to United. I did think of having it on my arm, but that wouldn't have the same impact.'

Despite his lifelong pledge of allegiance to the club, he has only been to Manchester United's home ground Old Trafford once after saving up for three years.

He currently lives with his mother and pet cat - named after his favourite player David Beckham - in a flat in Svishtov, Bulgaria.

While Mr United's tattoo is bold in its placement, it follows a long tradition of football club tattoos.

Last year a Manchester United supporter was photographed displaying a full back tattoo that paid tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson, the Busby Babes and a clock to mark the tragic events of the Munich air crash.

Below it featured Manchester United playing favourites George Best, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Eric Cantona.
