The morning queue for cronuts may be a lot shorter after a mouse was recorded scampering around Dominique Ansel Bakery on Thursday.

The downtown Manhattan bakery became famous last year when owner and pastry chef Dominique Ansel invented the cronut - a croissant/doughnut hybrid that has inspired epic hour-long waits in the morning.

But on Thursday a YouTube user took video of a mouse scampering around what appears to be the bakery's floor, which could cause the health department to close the facility.

Everyone loves Cronuts - even mice! Video taken by a customer shows a mouse scampering around the floor at Dominique Ansel Bakery - home to the ever-popular Cronut 

Shocking truth: The YouTube user made sure to tilt his camera up to prove he was inside the legendary bakery - as evidenced the signage above

Bold mouse: The YouTube use who took the video says he saw the mouse scamper around for a good 20 seconds before taking out his camera phone

Claim to fame: Dominique Ansel Bakery is world famous for inventing the Cronut - a croissant/donut hybrid that still inspires hour-long waits even a year after it hit the shelves

YouTube user Cody Pickrodt shot the video at Dominique Ansel, and spoke with Gothamist about the troubling sighting.

'I
 pointed it out to a couple waiting in line behind me. They didn't 
believe it until I showed them the video. Then they had to leave,' 
Pickrodt said.

'I didn't mention it to employees. It appeared they were all aware of it.

'This
 was the tail end of the little guy's adventure. He ran all over the 
place in plain view for a good 20 seconds before I got my phone out. 
Maybe Dominique needs a cat? Like bakeries did in the old days,' he suggested.

An
 employee who answered the phone at Dominique Ansel Thursday evening 
referred all comments to their PR representative, who later emailed a statement saying the famed bakery has done a deep clean.

'Following up on hearing the news, our staff spent 7 hours in a deep clean session,' the rep told MailOnline.

'We did not find anything at all and suspect it may been one solitary mouse that came in from the outside as we have a garden in the back and open the doors during the warmer days.

'Cleanliness is of utmost importance to us and in the 3 years that we've been opened, we've received nothing short of an A for our health inspections.'

The video comes just two days after 
another YouTube user posted two videos of rats infesting a Garment 
District Dunkin' Donuts location. 

After
 hearing about the reports, the New York City Health Department 
investigated and shut down the store at West 37th Street and 8th Avenue,
 citing a 'severe' pest infestation.

While the location manager initially denied the store had a vermin problem when contacted by Gothamist on Wednesday, today a man who answered the phone said: 'We have some issues'.

The location captured in the video 
previously had an 'A' rating from the health department, despite getting
 a citation for vermin-related issues in November 2013.
