A South African preacher who made his congregation eat grass to make them 'closer to God' before using them as a human carpet has now got them drinking petrol.

Pastor Lesego Daniel of the Rabboni Centre Ministry poured some of the liquid into a bucket before dropping a match into it and setting it alight to prove that it really was petrol.

Unveiling his latest 'miracle' to the congregation, he then told them that the petrol had been turned into pineapple juice and persuaded people to line up to take a sip from a bottle of the liquid.

Bizarre: Several members of the congregation step forward to drink the petrol, which Pastor Lesego Daniel claimed had been turned into pineapple juice

A video showing his congregation in the town of Garankuwa, near Pretoria in northern South Africa's Gauteng Province, drinking the yellow liquid warns: 'If you cannot turn water into wine, don't try this'.

Pastor Daniel tells his congregation: 'I want to prove to you, with the flames that will burn here, that it shows what can be achieved if you have faith.'

He adds: 'What you see, you have to believe it.' He then drinks some of the liquid himself.

GP Dr Arun Ghosh underlined the dangers of drinking petrol.

He told MailOnline: 'It's highly toxic and can give you serious gastric erosion. It will lead to severe stomach problems.'

The controversial preacher made international headlines in January when he was photographed persuading followers to eat the grass at his ministry.

He said that humans with faith eat anything to feed their bodies and can survive on whatever they choose to eat, and persuading them to eat grass and drink petrol was simply a way of proving the point.

One woman claimed eating grass stopped her having a sore throat, while another said it healed her after a stroke. 

Interviewed by local media one of the congregation, Rosemary Phetha, said: 'Yes, we eat grass and we're proud of it because it demonstrates that, with God's power, we can do anything.'

Another, Doreen Kgatle, 27, from Garankuwa, suffered a stroke two years ago. She said: 'I could not walk but soon after eating the grass, as the pastor had ordered, I started gaining strength and an hour later I could walk again.'

Photos showed that followers who had eaten grass then allowed Pastor Daniel to walk across them as they spread out on the floor.

The grass eating, however, failed to impress many with one outraged commentator saying: 'Is this a scene in a movie? This can't be real. God created animals to chew grass and made human beings to dominate over animals. Any person who reduces human beings to animals is definitely not of God.'

And another person wrote online: 'Why is he stepping on people? This is inhumane. Shocking.'
