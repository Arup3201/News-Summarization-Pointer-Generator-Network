Red-faced defence chiefs squandered millions of pounds on 6,000 pistols that were scrapped after just five years.

In a damning example of waste of the Ministry of Defence, top brass bought the Sig Sauer handguns before ditching them in favour of Austrian-made Glocks.

The embarrassing fiasco came at a time when the cash-strapped department was axing 30,000 troops, fighter jets, warships and tanks in a desperate bid to save money.

Waste: The Ministry of Defence spent millions on 6,000 pistols which it ditched after five years (file photo)

The MoD ordered the consignment of Sig semi-automatic pistols in 2008 as an Urgent Operational Requirement to enable British soldiers to protect themselves better in Afghanistan.

But in January last year the Army announced that after extensive tests it was replacing the ageing standard-issue Cold War-era Browning pistol - introduced nearly 50 years ago - with the Glock 17 Gen 4 handgun.

More than 25,000 are being purchased for Britain’s Armed Forces under a £9 million contract. The firearm - made famous in countless Hollywood movies such as Die Hard - is lighter, carries more bullets, fires more quickly and accurately, and is safer to handle than the Browning.

But it has fuelled fresh criticism of the MoD's procurement policies, raising questions over why taxpayers' cash was splurged on the Sigs.

The Treasury has spent £6 billion on Urgent Operations Requirements, or UORs, which has involved rushing new kit into service in Iraq and Afghanistan when existing equipment proves to be dangerously inadequate.

Obsolete: Used between 2008 and 2013, the pistols were Sig Sauer models similar to the one above

Major Richard Streatfield, who served in Helmand with the Rifles, hit out at the purchase of the Sigs as an example of waste, rather than long-term capital investment.

He said: 'What we've been having is the military equivalent of a fast-food diet. We need to get back to a more sustainable, balanced diet.'

Major Gen Richard Semple, the head of the Army's Logistics and Support, denied that public money had been wasted.

He said the Sigs had been used in Afghanistan and some of the money spent 'may well be recovered when they're disposed of'.

An MoD spokesman said: 'It is wrong to suggest the MoD wasted money on Sig Sauer pistols, which were bought in 2008 to meet an urgent operational requirement and used by British forces in Iraq and Afghanistan for five years.

'By 2013, extensive tests showed the Glock pistol offered a better long term solution to replace the Browning in terms of its capability and value for money.'

Meanwhile, it has emerged that a freak 30-minute hailstorm caused £10million damage to RAF planes in Afghanistan.

Damage: Cricket ball sized hailstones also punched holes in Hercules transporter planes like the one pictured

Cricket ball-sized hailstones punched holes in five C-130J Hercules transport planes.

Up to 15 other aircraft, including two VIP jets and Chinook, Sea King and Lynx helicopters were damaged, but the repair bill has not yet been calculated

The storm last April bombarded the huge NATO airbase in Kandahar causing 'serious damage'.

The hail damaged 851 aircraft panels including wings, flying controls, windscreens and fuselages.

Four Hercules, which operate as a 'taxi service' shifting troops, equipment and supplies around the warzone, were returned to the UK for repair work under Operation Weatherman at a cost of around £3million. The fifth was repaired in Afghanistan.

The storm caused damage to 80 coalition aircraft - more in the space of an hour than the Taliban has managed in 12 years of war.

It was so severe that three Afghan civilians were killed by falling balls of ice.

Defence Minister Philip Dunne finally confirmed the details in answer to a parliamentary question. Some of the planes are still out of action.

An MoD spokesman said: 'While we monitor the weather, this storm could not be predicted.'
