The three young children of Sydney siege victim Katrina Dawson have each picked a heartbreaking song to be played at their mother’s memorial service on Tuesday.

Ms Dawson's youngest daughter Sasha, who is four-years-old, has chosen Santa Claus Is Coming To Town for a moving farewell just two days before Christmas.

Six-year-old Oliver picked Somewhere Over The Rainbow and eight-year-old-Chloe has dedicated The Gambler, by Kenny Rogers, a song she reportedly enjoyed with her mother, the Daily Telegraph reports.The well-regarded barrister's life will be celebrated in The Great Hall at her alma mater, the University of Sydney, where she studied arts and law.

Ms Dawson died alongside Lindt café manager Tori Johnson in Martin Place, central Sydney, in the early hours of December 16 after being taken hostage by gunman Man Haron Monis for more than 16-hours.

Her husband Paul Smith will give a eulogy at the service and her parents and brothers will also pay tribute.

The family have asked attendees to wear a splash of aqua, Ms Dawson's favourite colour, to honour her life.

Organisers have also asked for donations to be made to the Katrina Dawson Foundation instead of flowers.

The charity was set up last week for women's education opportunities.

Ms Dawson's brother, Sandy Dawson, said that her tragic passing during the Martin Place siege would not prevent her legacy from living on.

'As the city's poignant and continuing tribute to her and Tori Johnson shows, even people who did not know her do not wish the end of her life to be the end of her good work,' Mr Dawson, a well-known Sydney barrister, said today.

The Foundation was established to 'preserve and honour the memory of Katrina Dawson and all she achieved'.

Former Governor-General Dame Quentin Bryce has been reported to be the founding member of the charity, with the move coming on the heels of a memorial fund for Mr Johnson.

'The foundation's focus is particularly appropriate because education, and particularly women's education, was something incredibly important to Katrina and in which she achieved true excellence,' said Mr Dawson. 

The 38-year-old was buried privately on Monday.

Meanwhile, grieving family and friends of Mr Johnson will pay their final respects to the brave 34-year-old at a private memorial service at St Stephen's Uniting Church on Tuesday morning.

The church in Sydney's CBD is only a few hundred metres from where he died.

In the wake of the pair's tragic deaths, thousands of Sydneysiders have visited Martin Place where the public outpouring of grief has manifested in a sea of floral tributes.
