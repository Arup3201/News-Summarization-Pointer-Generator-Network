Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini will have to pull off the seemingly impossible to avoid being sacked, believes Jamie Carragher.

Sportsmail columnist Carragher feels Pellegrini must try to emulate what Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc did against Chelsea in the Champions League if he is to save his job.

City travel to Barcelona 2-1 down from the first leg  and it could take something similar to PSG's heroics at Stamford Bridge for Pellegrini to avoid going the same way as Roberto Mancini in 2013.

Mancini was dismissed a year after winning the Barclays Premier League title and Pellegrini has told Sportsmail he recognises his challenge for this season is to repeat the trick or do better in Europe.

Carragher, speaking on Sky Sports, said: 'I think he's got a big problem in terms of his job because you only have to look at the owners and how they dealt with Mancini - a man who won the league, I think he won the FA Cup. Pellegrini won a domestic cup and the league in his first season.

'The exact same thing is happening. They're just drifting in that second season. I think he's going to need a result like Laurent Blanc got.

'I think Laurent Blanc saved his job at Paris Saint-Germain in that Chelsea game. I think he's going to need something like that on Wednesday night in the Nou Camp to stay there at the club.' 

City meet Barcelona on Wednesday night having lost 2-1 in their opening leg at the Etihad, where former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez scored twice and Gael Clichy was sent off.
