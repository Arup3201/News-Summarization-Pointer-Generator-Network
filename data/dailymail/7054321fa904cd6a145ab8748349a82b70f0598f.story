Selfridges is hardly your average department store with the famous black and yellow retailer playing host to some rather unusual facilities.

From hairdressers and sushi bars to ice rinks and even putting forward an application to open a Zoo on it's  store, the store is always finding new ways to stand out.

So it comes as no surprise that the iconic shop has decided to add a cinema to it's ever growing amenities and according to them it is the first of it's kind.

Selfridges department store opens the world's first in-store cinema tomorrow

Selfridges claim that the theatre that will open in it's flagship store on Oxford Street, will be the first to be operated within a department store, screening a series of classic and contemporary films.  

The cinema, in collaboration with the independent chain Everyman, will initially screen films selected by designers from the store's Masters campaign.

The campaign showcases the work of 12 influential designers such as Paul Smith, Marc Jacobs and Oscar de la Renta who were chosen for their 'idiosyncratic impact on fashion over the past 50 years'.

The cinema is a theatre with a difference with sofas and cushions rather than traditional fold up seats

The 12 Masters' film selection is made up from their favourite movies including Bruce Robinson's Withnail and I chosen by Paul Smith, Ken Russell's The Devils chosen by Rick Owens and Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides selected by Marc Jacobs.

As well as old favourites the cinema will showcase several new releases the first being  Magic in the Moonlight, the new Woody Allen film starring Colin Firth and Emma Stone and set in the 1920s on the French Riviera.

The film will offer Woody Allen fans an opportunity to see it first with the film being screened on September 18 ahead of its official release the next day.

Selfridges have collaborated with independent cinema chain Everyman in order to launch their very first movie theatre

The theatre opens its doors tomorrow, when it will screen the Audrey Hepburn classic Breakfast At Tiffany's, as well as Breathless, The Grand Budapest Hotel and The Wolf Of Wall Street.

For Linda Hewson, creative director of Selfridges a movie theatre was an obvious choice for such a visually led store.

'As a store, we continuously challenge ourselves to offer customers great retail theatre.

'Shopping is a fun form of escapism, so to offer our customers access to the escapist power of cinema within Selfridges, makes for a great combination.

The first 12 films were selected by designers from the store's Master's campaign 

'With this in mind, Selfridges is delighted to launch a fully-fledged cinema in collaboration with Everyman within our Oxford Street store.'

Everyman Cinemas chief executive Andrew Myers agrees that shopping and cinema go hand in hand.

'What a perfect way to relax after a hard day of shopping - put your feet up and let us spoil you with a nibble, a drink and a great film.

'We know that bringing the Everyman experience into the heart of the UK's greatest department store will be enjoyed by both our audiences.'

Ticket prices will range from £7.50 for kids' club screenings to £20 for an evening seat. The cinema is scheduled to run until spring next year.
