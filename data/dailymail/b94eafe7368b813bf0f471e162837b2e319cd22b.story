Beyoncé and Jay Z’s vacation in Cuba last week was fully licensed by the United States Treasury Department, according to a source familiar with the trip.

After the RnB power couple celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary in Havana, Republican members of Congress asked for information on what type of license they obtained.

Their arrival drew in huge crowds of local fans as they strolled hand in hand through the city and posed for pictures with admiring Cubans.

But the longstanding U.S. trade embargo against Cuba prevents most Americans from traveling to the island without a license granted by the U.S. government.

However, President Barack Obama's administration has eased restrictions on travel to Cuba for academic, religious or cultural programs.

In a letter dated on Friday, U.S. Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, asked Adam Szubin, director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, for "information regarding the type of license that Beyoncé and Jay-Z received, for what purpose, and who approved such travel."

Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart represent districts in south Florida where there is a high Cuban-American population.

"Despite the clear prohibition against tourism in Cuba, numerous press reports described the couple's trip as tourism, and the Castro regime touted it as such in its propaganda," the letter said.

"We represent a community of many who have been deeply and personally harmed by the Castro regime's atrocities, including former political prisoners and the families of murdered innocents."

Representatives for Beyoncé did not immediately respond for comment on Saturday.

In Washington last week, the State Department said it had no prior knowledge of the visit.

A spokeswoman at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana said she did not know if the celebrity couple obtained a license for their trip.

If they did not, they could be exposed to a fine.
