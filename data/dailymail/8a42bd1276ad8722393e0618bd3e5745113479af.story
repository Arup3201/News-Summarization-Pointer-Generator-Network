Andros Townsend scored the only goal of the game as Tottenham beat Sheffield United 1-0 in their Capital One Cup semi-final first leg.

The hosts had struggled to break down the Blades until mid way through the second half when Jay McEvely handled the ball in the box to give the Premier league side a penalty. Townsend stepped up to spare Mauricio Pochettino's blushes and give Spurs an advantage going into the second leg.

Andros Townsend scores the only goal of the game from the penalty spot during the second half

TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1) 

Michel Vorm – 6

Services not in demand with Sheffield United struggling to muster a shot on target.

Kyle Walker – 6

Boyhood Blades fan lucky to get away with it as he twice gave the ball away inside his own box but otherwise solid

Eric Dier – 6.5

A constant aerial threat and had a good effort saved in the first half.

Jan Vertonghen – 6

Had to apologise to Michel Vorm after a dodgy back pass in the first half.

Jay McEveley handles the ball in the box to give away the penalty while Roberto Soldado watches on 

Ben Davies –5

Looked out of sorts. Struggled to handle the pace of Campbell Ryce at times and gave away the ball on several occasions.

Andros Townsend – 8

Spurs' brightest player, put a shift in, made his pace count and enticed fouls even if he did run down a couple of blind alleys. Deserved to get the winner.

Ryan Mason – 5.5

Coming back from injury. Hauled off for Dembele on 64 minutes after running out of steam.

Benjamin Stambouli – 7

Looked a bit lethargic at times but made his size count in 50/50 challenges.

Emmanuel Adebayor was unimpressive during his match as captain of Tottenham 

Christian Eriksen – 6

Played a peach of a through ball to Adebayor which the striker should have done better with but not his best game.

Emmanuel Adebayor – 5

The captain’s first and final notable contribution to the game was a petulant hand in the face of teenager Louis Reed in the 16th minute for which he was lucky to just get a yellow card. Did not lead by example.

Harry Kane – 6

Was barely involved in the first half bar a couple of good defensive headers, more lively in the second. No hometown-boy heroics this time. 

Mauricio Pochettino – 6.5 

SUBS: Dembele 6, Soldado 6.

SHEFFIELD UNITED (4-2-3-1) 

Mark Howard – 6.5

Made two important saves and commanded his defence. Also has possibly the biggest boot seen at White Hart Lane. Some goal kicks nearly counted as shots on target.

Bob Harris – 7

A no nonsense name for a no nonsense player. Put a shift in.

Louis Reed – 7

The 17-year-old was not daunted by the occasion or a palm in the face by Adebayor.

Chris Basham – 6

Defender back into Clough’s starting 11 after three games out. Handled Adebayor well, not that the Togolese posed many problems.

Kyle Walker of Spurs holds off the challenge of Jamie Murphy of Sheffield United

Jay McEveley – 5

Made a timely challenge to deny Adebayor in the first half but a deserved yellow for rash sliding tackle on Townsend and gave away the crucial penalty with a handball, which may have been accidental.

Michael Doyle – 6

The captain did well to rouse his team but was somewhat outclassed, making a few dodgy back passes.

Ryan Flynn – 6

The winger and Liverpool academy product was a bit quiet after a good chance in the opening five minutes when he skipped past a couple of Spurs defenders.

Jamal Campbell-Ryce – 7

A bright spark for the Blades. Demonstrated some nifty footwork and created enough space to whip a few useful balls into the box. Spurs struggled to defend against him. 

Stefan Scougall – 6 

The Scotsman linked up well with McNulty and narrowly missed giving United and unlikely lead in the first half.

Jamie Murphy – 5.5

Was a threat throughout and won a few corners, made Kyle Walker look elementary on occasion.

Marc McNulty – 7

Sheffield’s top scorer with ten goals this season but had precious little opportunity to add to that tally. 

Nigel Clough – 6 

Jamal Campbell-Ryce tries to cross the ball while Ben Davies attempts a block
