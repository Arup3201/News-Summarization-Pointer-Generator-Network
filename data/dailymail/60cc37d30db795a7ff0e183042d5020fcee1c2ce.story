Assaidi enjoyed a successful loan spell at Stoke last season and scored a memorable winner against Chelsea before his season was temporarily ended by a knee injury. He has spent his summer seeing a specialist in Holland to try and get fit for the new season.

Stoke hope to hear next week about 23-year-old Krkic who was on loan at Ajax last season. Hughes has been a fan of the player for a long time and tried to sign him as a teenager when he was at Manchester City.

Hughes will listen to offers for Honduras World Cup captain Wilson Palacios, Ryan Shotton and striker Cameron Jerome as he tries to trim his squad.
