It's the chum of all fears.

One of the most notorious spots for shark attacks on the Australian coast just got a whole lot more dangerous.

Beaches along the tourist mecca strip of the Sunshine Coast have been targeted by people removing baited hooks from drum lines and the activity is 'putting lives at risk'.

Men in grey suits: Queensland's chief shark ranger warns lives are at risk after baited hooks were vandalised

Jeff Krause, boss of the Queensland government's shark control program, said 18 drum lines - designed to snare sharks and keep them away from swimmers - have been targeted off Yaroomba and Currumundi over recent weeks.

'It appears that someone, or a number of people, have purposely gone out to the drum lines with the intention of removing the hooks,' Mr Krause said.

'This is very dangerous and illegal, and compromises the effectiveness of the shark control program putting lives at risk.'

Asked if conservationists were the likely suspects, Mr Krause said: 'We are unsure of who is taking the hooks so will continue to monitor the equipment.'

A spokeswoman for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said it is the first time shark control devices had been tampered with in this way.

The offence carries with it an on the spot fine of $1100 and a maximum fine of $55,000.

'We have shark nets and drum lines positioned approximately 300â€“400 metres offshore at 85 popular beaches at 10 regional centres in Queensland.

Installed off popular swimming beaches, drum lines consist of a floating drum (or buoy) with two lines attached.

One line is anchored to the sea floor and another is fitted with a baited hook used to snare predatory sharks.

They are controversial devices and many conservationists have campaigned against their use.

'While the shark control program does not provide a permanent barrier between swimmers and sharks, it is effective in reducing the overall number of sharks in the area, making it a safer place to swim.'

The most recent fatal shark attack in Australia lead to the death of 63-year-old Tathra woman Christine Armstrong, who was killed by a shark off her home beach in April.

However, Queensland remains by far the most attack-prone state in the country with 67 fatalities and 126 injuries in the last 100 years. New South Wales is second with 47 deaths.

Australia trails only America in number of fatal unprovoked shark attacks and Great White Sharks are the species responsible for most deaths by far.

People who see vandals attempting to remove bait from drum lines are encouraged to call the 24 hour 'Fishwatch Hotline' on 1800 017 116.
