The teenager driving a runaway tipper truck which killed four people including a four-year-old-girl had only qualified to drive an articulated lorry a few days before the tragic crash.

Philip Potter, 19, posed for a photo holding up his hauliers licence and posted it on his Facebook page on February 4 - a day after his birthday.

His father, Frederick, wrote on the website: 'Very proud day of Philip Potter passing his HGV artic test first time day after his nineteenth birthday well done - feeling happy.'

Mr Potter had qualified to drive an articulated lorry just days earlier, when he posted this picture  on Facebook

Philip Potter was behind the wheel of the lorry which crashed in Bath this week, killing four. Witnesses said the vehicle's brakes appeared failed before the crash

Mr Potter is understood to have passed his HGV licence three months ago, before passing his articulated lorry licence five days before the accident.

The 32-ton Scania tipper truck Mr Potter was driving careered down a steep narrow hill next to a school in Bath, Somerset, on Monday.

Witnesses at the scene said it appeared that the lorry's brakes failed in the moments before the accident and Mr Potter frantically sounded his horn to alert drivers and pedestrians.

He is said to have used the front walls of nearby homes to slow the vehicle down before it came to halt in a hedge and tipped onto its side. 

The vehicle hit  Mitzi Rosanna Steady, four, who died instantly, and  her grandmother Margaret Rogers was left fighting for her life.

The lorry also collided with a Volvo at the bottom of the steep hill, killing Stephen Vaughan, 34, Phillip Allen, 52, and Robert Parker, 59, who were inside the car. 

The grieving widow of Mr Vaughan, Sian, has since paid tribute to her taxi driver husband 34, as a 'true gentleman' and said she was 'honoured' to have been chosen to be his wife. The couple  only married last summer in Turkey.

'We are devastated that he was taken away from us so soon,' she added in a statement released by police.

Witnesses said the  brakes of the vehicle - which would not be classified as an articulated lorry - failed moments before the accident and it ended up on its side

The family of Mitzi also released a photograph of the little girl and a short statement saying: 'Mitzi Rosanna Steady, aged four, loved and missed by us all.'  

There are also a growing numbers of floral tributes being left at a nearby 'memorial tree' and books of condolences will be opened at libraries in Weston and Bath as the tight-knit community attempt to come to term with their grief.

Mr Potter's parents declined to comment at the family farm today.

A relative of Mr Potter, who asked not to be named, said: 'He's a lovely person. He's loyal and a hard working, nice man. Nobody wants to be in this situation. It is all very, very difficult.

'The last thing he would want to be involved in is a situation where there has been an accident. Nobody wants to be involved in that.'

'Steve was infectious; when he smiled, the whole room would smile.

'Myself, Steve's parents and family are very proud of the man he was, a true gentleman and we were so privileged to have been a part of his life.

'We are devastated that he was taken away from us so soon.

'We had only been married six months and I was honoured that he chose me to be his wife. Steve was dedicated to his family and his business which made him a well-respected businessman.

'Even though we are going through our loss, our hearts go out to all the other families that have lost loved ones and we would like to thank the emergency services and the local community for everything that they have done for us at this sad time.'

The family member added: 'If you could change yesterday, wouldn't you just? It's like all accidents, we just wish we weren't there at that particular time. We would all change it.

'We all feel very sorry about it all.'

Mr Potter, a farmer's son from Brinkworth, Wiltshire, was driving for local firm Grittenham Haulage when the crash happened.

The company, whose boss has declined to comment on the incident, is licensed to use five vehicles.

Locals  said Mr Potter was working out of a yard used by the haulage firm, just half a mile from his house.

It is understood the truck Mr Potter was using had picked up its load of sand from Hills Quarry in Cirencester around an hour's drive from where the crash happened.

The truck involved in the accident would have been classified as an HGV rather than an articulated lorry for licencing purposes.

The name of the fourth victim, Robert Parker, was released by police yesterday. He, along with his colleague Phil Allen, had been picked up by chauffeur Mr Vaughan to be returned to their homes in south Wales on the day of the crash. All three died when Mr Vaughan's Volvo was hit.

Both Mr Parker and Mr Allen were executives at Western Power Distribution, an electricity network firm based in Bristol. 

A company spokeswoman said today: 'We can confirm the tragedy in Bath on Monday has claimed the lives of two colleagues who were also among our most senior of managers – Phil Allen, our Resources and External Affairs Director – and Bob Parker, our Planning and Special Regulation Projects Manager.

'Both were very well respected by friends and staff alike and we are all deeply shocked by this tragic event. Our thoughts are with their wives and families at this very sad time.'

It is thought the truck entered Lansdown Lane, where the crash happened, from the top of the hill, where a 6ft width limit is in force.

However, it is understood a sign warning of the limit had been knocked over by a car some weeks earlier during icy weather.

An investigation into the crash is ongoing. No arrests have been made.

Police are still investigating the incident. The lorry was removed from the scene the night after the crash
