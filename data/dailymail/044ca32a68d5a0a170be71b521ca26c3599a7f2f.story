Hillary 
Clinton urges caution on 'under-delivering' Assad

Syria's brazen dictator took time out from orchestrating the brutal crackdown of his own citizens to walk around the battered Baba Amr neighbourhood of Homs.

Bashar Assad arrogantly strutted around the ravaged district - the former rebel stronghold which until March 1 was under siege as his troops pounded its civilians almost into oblivion.

Heavily flanked by security, the ruthless regime leader yesterday told the few remaining residents not killed in the month-long bombardment that they would 'return better than before'.

He said 'normal life' would soon resume - at the same time as the death toll for the year-long conflict escalated to a staggering 9,000.

Reassuring: Assad toured the former rebel 
stronghold of Baba Amr, in Homs, and told residents that the battered 
neighbourhood would be rebuilt and that normal life would resume

People person: Assad showed extreme audacity by returning to the district which, until just four weeks ago, was a rebel stronghold full of activists who wanted him ousted from power

During his apparent show of control 
he appeared relaxed, wearing a blue shirt and sports coat, as he shook 
hands and hugged supporters and soldiers who shouted 'we are with you 
until death'.

* Syria commits to work with Annan 'in an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people'

* Syria commits to stop fighting and immediately stop troop movements and use of heavy weapons in populated areas. Syria should work with Annan to end all violence, under UN supervision. Annan will seek similar commitments from opposition to stop fighting

* Syria accepts and implements a daily two hour 'humanitarian pause' to deliver aid and evacuate the injured

* Syria commits to intensify 'the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons' and provide a list of all places where such people are being held

* Syria commits to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists 'and a non-discriminatory visa policy for them'

* Syria commits to 'respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully as legally guaranteed'Â 

These terms have reportedly been accepted by the Syrian government.

His audacious walkabout came as Kofi Annan 
claimed a major breakthrough in the Syrian conflict which he hopes will 
lead to a ceasefire from its brutal government troops.

The United Nations' envoy said he had 
received regime backing for a six-point plan which will see a daily 
two-hour halt in fighting to evacuate the injured.

Annan also claimed to have reached an agreement, crucially backed by China 
and Russia, for Syrian-led political talks to address the concerns of 
citizens.

Annan's spokesman said he believes Syria's acceptance of the peace plan is an important first step which now needs to be immediately implemented.

Annan, who is also an envoy for the Arab League, told reporters after meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in Beijing yesterday he had received a 'positive' response from Syria as well as support from China.

He said he received a similar commitment from Russia over the weekend.

'We've had very good discussions about the situation in Syria. And they have offered me their full support,' Annan said after the meeting with Wen.

Wen said work on a solution to the crisis is at a 'critical juncture', adding that China backed Annan's mediation efforts.

The support from China and Russia may 
have been important in nudging Syria on the plan, which has been 
endorsed by the UN Security Council in a non-binding presidential 
statement.

Destruction: Heavy shelling by Syrian government forces has reduced Qusair to rubble

China and Russia have twice vetoed proposed UN sanctions over Assad's crackdown on a year long uprising in which more than 9,000 people are believe to have died.

The two countries called those proposed UN resolutions unbalanced, saying they blamed only the Syrian government and demanded an end to government attacks, but not ones by the opposition.

Annan views Syria's acceptance of the plan 'as an important initial step that could bring an end to the violence and the bloodshed.

It could also, he believes, provide aid to the suffering, and create an environment conducive to a political dialogue that would fulfil the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.

Could it soon be over? Kofi Annan has hailed a major breakthrough in talks with Syrian officials - which could see a ceasefire and ending of awful scenes such as this one in the city of Homs

Annan 'stressed that implementation will be key, not only for the Syrian people, who are caught in the middle of this tragedy, but also for the region and the international community as a whole'.

UN Human rights chief Navi Pillay today claimed children were being held in detention, without medical care, in 'horrendous' tactics by Assad's regime.

She said: 'They've gone for the children - for whatever purposes - in large numbers. Hundreds detained and tortured... it's just horrendous.

'Children shot in the knees, held together with adults in really inhumane conditions, denied medical treatment for their injuries, either held as hostages or as sources of information.

'That is the legal situation. Factually there is enough evidence pointing to the fact many of these acts are committed by the security forces and must have received the approval or the complicity at the highest level.

'Because President Assad could simply issue an order to stop the killings and the killings would stop.'

Syrian opposition members reacted with scepticism, however. Rami Jarah, who was attending an opposition meeting today in Turkey, said President Bashar Assad is trying to stall for time.

He said: 'The Syrian government is going to depend on propaganda as it has over the past few months - propaganda of armed terrorists.' Bassma Kodmani, Paris-based member of the opposition Syrian National Council, said she welcomed the regime's acceptance of the plan.

But when asked if she believed the regime would honour the plan, she only said: 'We hope that we can move toward a peace process.'

Louay Safi, of the opposition Syrian National Council, said: 'We are not sure if it's political maneuvering or a sincere act. We have no trust in the current regime. ... We have to see that they have stopped killing civilians.'

And U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Assad must now act. She said: 'Given Assad's history of overpromising and under-delivering, that commitment must now be matched by immediate action. We will judge Assad's sincerity and seriousness by what he does, not by what he says.

'If he is ready to bring this dark chapter in Syria's history to a close, he could prove it by immediately ordering regime forces to stop firing and begin withdrawing from populated areas.'

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Assad's decision was only a first step, saying: 'We will continue to judge the Syrian regime by its practical actions, not by its often empty words.'

Rubble: The violence in Syria could soon come to an end, if the major breakthrough hailed by Kofi Annan is as crucial as he says

About 60 countries, including the United
 States, are to attend a 'Friends of the Syrian People' conference in 
Istanbul on Sunday.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said yesterday that China was invited but would not attend. Washington and many of its allies have said Assad has lost all legitimacy and must step down. China says the crisis needs to be resolved through talks.

The conference in Istanbul comes as Turkey edges closer to setting up a buffer zone in Syria to protect civilians. Turkish officials have long been hesitant about the idea.

But they now say a surge of refugees from Syria might compel Turkey, preferably with international backing, to establish a buffer zone on Syrian soil to guarantee the security of its own southern border as well as the welfare of civilians fleeing violence.

Chinese analysts said Beijing was unlikely to support the buffer zone proposal, especially if the possibility of Western military action against Syria is not ruled out.

'China will not accept that proposal. But it will not openly oppose it either,' said Wang Lian, a Middle East expert at the School of International Studies at Peking University.

Wu Bingbing, an expert on Arabian issues at Peking University, agreed China would not back a buffer zone, saying it infringed on Syria's sovereignty.

'A balance must be achieved between promoting the easing of the humanitarian crisis in Syria and ensuring Syria's sovereignty,' he said.

Yesterday's developments came as the country was hit by more bloodshed, with intense clashes between government troops and rebels spilled across the border into Lebanon.

Syrian troops did not physically cross the border, according to two Lebanese security officials.

But bullets whizzed across the frontier into a rural, sparsely populated area around the Lebanese village of Qaa.

A source said: 'There is no Syrian military presence on the Lebanese side of the border.'

And this morning three government soldiers were killed in clashes with rebels in Homs province.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the clashes broke out when government forces tried to enter the town of Rastan.

Fresh clashes in the Deir el-Zour province along the Iraqi border are also being reported.Â
