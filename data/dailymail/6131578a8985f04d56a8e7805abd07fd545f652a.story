The European Space Agency (ESA) claims one of its sleek research satellites, dubbed the 'Ferrari of space', has plummeted somewhere into the South Atlantic ocean. 

ESA said the 1,100-kilogram (2,425-pound) GOCE satellite, which ran out of fuel in October, re-entered the atmosphere at about 0000 GMT Monday.

It followed a descending orbit that extended across Siberia, the western Pacific Ocean, the eastern Indian Ocean and Antarctica.

Most of the satellite disintegrated in the high atmosphere, but tracking data from both the U.S. and Europe suggests the surviving debris fell just off the coast of South America, south of the Falkland 
Islands.

With a sleek, aerodynamic design responsible for its Ferrari nickname, GOCE was the first uncontrolled re-entry of a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite since 1987.

Prior to its descend, ESA estimated that the chance of an individual being struck by the debris would lower than being hit by a meteorite.

Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer

Launched: 17 March 2009

Launcher: Rockot (with Breeze-KM upper stage) by Eurockot Launch Services GmbH

Launch site: Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia

Nominal life: 20 months

Cost: $466million

Orbit: About 161.5 miles altitude, polar, Sun-synchronous

Mass: 2,000lbs

Dimensions: 17.4 feet long, about 3.3 foot body diameter

Propulsion tank: 88.2lbs of xenon gas

Mission: Measuring Earth's gravity field and modelling the geoid with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution

The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) had been orbiting Earth since March 2009 at the lowest altitude of any research satellite.

It's been gradually descending over the last three weeks after running out of fuel October 21.

ESA says its information is now being used to understand ocean circulation, sea level, ice dynamics and the Earth's interior.

During its mission, it has produced a unique model of the ‘geoid’, which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another.

GOCE’s ion engine, responsible for keeping the satellite at an incredibly low orbit of under 260 km, together with its accelerometer measurements have also provided new insight into air density and wind speeds in the upper atmosphere.

An international campaign involving the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee and ESA’s Space Debris Office monitored the reentry.

The above illustration shows key features of ESA's GOCE satellite which disintegrated in the atmosphere in the early hours of this morning. Around 25 per cent of the satellite is thought to have plummeted into the South Atlantic

'The one-tonne GOCE satellite is only a small fraction of the 100–150 tonnes of man-made space objects that reenter Earth’s atmosphere annually,” said Heiner Klinkrad, Head of ESA’s Space Debris Office.

'In the 56 years of spaceflight, some 15 000 tonnes of man-made space objects have reentered the atmosphere without causing a single human injury to date.'

Under UN’s Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects created in September of 1972, should a space fragment cause damage upon re-entry, the country that launched the satellite would be held accountable, Fox News reported.

The treaty, which has been ratified by 88 countries as of January 2013, guarantees that the state responsible will pay compensation. In the case of GOCE, the satellite was launched from Russia, so that country would be on the hook for any damage.

During its mission, GOCE has produced a unique model of the geoid, which is essentially a virtual surface where water does not flow from one point to another.
