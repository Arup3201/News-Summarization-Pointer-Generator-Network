Late Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi raped countless women during his years in power, according to an explosive new documentary.

German broadcaster RTL is set to screen the controversial programme - which includes interviews with his inner circle - next Monday.

Reporter Antonia Rados said; 'There were many women in Libya spellbound by Gaddafi who wanted to meet him. And when they did he raped them.'

The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has said there was evidence that Gaddafi had instructed his troops to rape women

She said that his female bodyguards, who were supposed to lay down their lives to protect him, were also victims.

A prominent Libyan psychologist Dr Seham Sergewa said he knew of at least five of his Amazonian bodyguards who were raped by him.

Rape as a means of subduing the population was also passed on to soldiers and loyal militias who were provided with condoms and Viagra to encourage their assaults.

In June last year Luis Moreno-Ocampo,
 the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, said there was 
evidence that Gaddafi had instructed his troops to rape women who had 
voiced opposition to his regime.

Ms Rados
 goes on to say in the report that many women were abused by him within 
moments of meeting.

And he made a point of forgiving rebellious elements
 in his tribal society if they made 'gifts' of young women to him.
