Brendan Rodgers has rubbished claims that he has fallen out with Roy Hodgson after the England manager revealed Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling had complained of tiredness while on international duty.

Rodgers was unhappy with widespread criticism directed towards the 19-year-old in the wake of Hodgson's comments following England's Euro 2016 qualifying win against Estonia.

The Three Lions boss opted to bring Sterling off the bench in Tallinn before admitting that he had spoken to him about his form and fitness.

Rodgers told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show on talkSPORT: 'We have exchanged messages and there is no problem at all.

'We spoke a lot prior to the World Cup. There were various staff members with England that work for Liverpool and obviously we provide a number of players for them. The relationship was good and still is good.'

The pair were also pitted against each other after Reds forward Daniel Sturridge was ruled out of action for six weeks after picking up a thigh injury during an England training session in September.

But Rodgers, who questioned Hodgson's handling of his striker at the time, insists he has been in contact with the 67-year-old and even spoke to him at Loftus Road on Sunday following his side's 3-2 win against QPR.

Rodgers and Hodgson also disagreed about an injury picked up by Daniel Sturridge on England duty last month

He added: 'After the World Cup, we have spoken and exchanged texts and messages and, even after the game yesterday (Sunday), I said I would keep him up to speed with how Daniel Sturridge is getting on. So, there is no issue.'

Alan Shearer and Michael Owen were among those to criticise Sterling's stance ahead of the game against Estonia but Rodgers felt the reaction of some people was over the top.

Speaking about his young midfielder, Rodgers said: 'He is a wonderful boy. It was such a shame.

'If you look at it from Roy's perspective he obviously wanted to give Adam Lallana a chance and felt he could use the squad. So Raheem comes out, which won't do him any harm at all, and then for the next week to ten days it was all blown up.'
