Lionel Messi now has more career goals than Raul after netting his 424th during Barcelona's win over Atletico Madrid on Sunday.

Messi has made a habit of breaking records recently and he has achieved this feat at just 27 years old.

In November, Messi became the outright top scorer in the history of the Champions League, also leapfrogging Raul, after he scored a fine hat-trick against APOEL Nicosia. That took him to 74 for the tournament and he finished this season's group stage with another goal against Paris Saint-Germain.

The Barcelona star also reached 100 La Liga assists in the Atletico win and became the second player to achieve this feat in the last 25 years, after Luis Figo.

Messi, who is in Zurich but is expected to lose out to Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d'Or award, celebrated the win that moved Barcelona to within one point of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, by committing his future to the club.

The Argentine hit out at 'lies' linking him with a move to the Premier League. Messi started following Chelsea on Instagram last Monday - the day he failed to turn up for training complaining of a stomach bug. 

Stories have circulated in the Spanish press in recent weeks of Barcelona being in crisis with claims that many players, including Messi, were unhappy with Luis Enrique's tactics and coaching methods.

He said: 'I've heard stories I've spoken to Chelsea or City, that's all lies.

'I've heard so many things. There have been things said in the past that I have bad relationships with (Pep) Guardiola, (Samuel) Eto'o, Bojan (Krkic), Ibra (Zlatan Ibrahimovic), that's not true.

'I never asked for them to get rid of the coach or anybody. That's not true, I would never do that.'

Raul and Messi both scored an impressive number of goals for Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively

On March 16, against Osasuna, he passed Paulino Alcantara to become Barcelona's all-time top goalscorer (371)

A week later he overtook Alfredo Di Stefano as the outright El Clasico top goalscorer (21) with a hat-trick in a 4-3 win against Real Madrid

He scored his 400th career goal in a 6-0 win against Granada on September 27

He passed Telmo Zarra's 59-year-old record to become La Liga's all-time top goalscorer (253) on November 22

Three days later he overtook Raul by scoring a hat-trick to become the outright top goalscorer in the history of the Champions League (74) - he now has 75
