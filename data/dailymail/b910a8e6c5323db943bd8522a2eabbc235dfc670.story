Most of us are only just getting used to seeing a little sunshine after a soaking summer.

But one pub has decided to skip Autumn and head for December by putting up its Christmas tree 110 days early.

And The Wylde Green has already served its first festive meal. As many as 40 drinkers tucked into Christmas lunch on August 26.

Jingle tills: The Wylde Green has put up its Christmas Tree to attract Christmas bookings.

Lisa Evans is assistant manager at the business, in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham.

The 39-year-old said: 'It's all to do with getting our bookings for Christmas, to be fair. We like to get it up early to explain what we have got going on and get as many bookings as we can.

'It's going all right at the moment, we have got quite a few.'

Locals have been bemused by the addition to their bar. Some have told staff: 'It's way too early.'

'They think we are a bit mad to be honest. It is a bit early isn't it?' Lisa said.

'But all the Hungry Horse pubs should have their trees up, to be fair, to promote their Christmas bookings.

'I think most of the others will be putting theirs up shortly. We have to be first at everything.'

Santa and his helper bring some festive cheer. Two months before Bonfire night

They wish it could be Christmas every day? Drinkers enjoy the sunshine.

And piles of crackers adorn a display on one side of the pub. Kids have been pulling them.

'We did have a Christmas weekend a couple of weeks back,' Lisa said.

'We had a Santa in and we did Christmas dinners on the Sunday.

'That was Sunday, August 26. We did two for £10. 'It was turkey and all the trimmings, and all the Christmas diners were out. But we didn't dress the tables, we just did the promotion. It was basically to give customers a taste of what the Christmas dinners are like.'

The pub is owned by the Greene King brewery. Spokesman Greg Gibbons said: 'We are 50 per cent full even now, so it’s a reminder to customers.

'People have become more wary of spending
money and they like to plan their spending ahead. The festive season is
not too far away - even though the weather outside is tremendous.

'When a customer realises it’s just four more pay days until Christmas it brings it home how close we are.'

Morrisons stores have started stocking up for the festive season.

At supermarket Morrisons, in Wokingham, in Berkshire, they have already started stacking the shelves with Christmas goodies.

Branches of Tesco have already set up dedicated Christmas aisles across the nation.

The
first reports of Christmas chocolate boxes on sale in Tesco came on the August 29 when pictures appeared on Twitter.

Since then the Twitter-sphere has been filled with angry posts about premature holiday season advertisements.

Clergyman Rod Lewis, a pastor in the Black Country, claimed the true meaning of Christmas had been hijacked by commercialism.He said: 'It
seems to get earlier each year and the emphasis has moved away from the
birth of Christ to people trying to make as much money as possible.

'The
true significance of Christmas has been lost.'People
want to cash in on the festival but it’s always been that way. However,
I have been surprised to see how early advertising material and 
decorations have appeared this year.'
