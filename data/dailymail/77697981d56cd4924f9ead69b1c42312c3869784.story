Credit card fraudster Szymon Lam was jailed after police raided his house and find £90,000 of gold and silver

Police discovered a 'glittering Aladdin’s cave' of gold and silver bullion worth £90,000 when they searched the penthouse flat of a credit card fraudster, a court has heard.

A high-powered Maserati sports car was also seized in the raid on Polish national Szymon Lam’s swish riverside apartment in Leeds.

West Yorkshire Police officers searched Lam’s home at the Santorini flats beside the river Aire in September 2010 after receiving a tip-off from officers in London.

Ian Brook, prosecuting at Leeds Crown Court, said: 'When they got there the police found a glittering Aladdin’s cave.'

Mr Brook said photographs of the huge haul of bullion made for 'impressive viewing'.

Officers in Leeds were asked to go to the flat after Lam’s wife had been detained at the exclusive Chelsea Bridge Hotel after a form was completed with a false address, the court heard.

Police went to her room and found a laptop containing high volumes of credit card numbers.

Another laptop containing credit card details was also found in Leeds.

The court heard Lam and his wife were highly intelligent, financially astute and had 21 bank accounts between them.

Lam had profited to the tune of £128,000 through his fraudulent activities, around £90,000 of which he had invested in gold and silver bullion (pictured)

After his arrest, Lam told police he had come to the UK eight years previously with just £500 in his pocket and was now worth £250,000.

Lam was jailed for three years on Thursday after pleading guilty to money laundering offences.

The court heard Lam siphoned off the proceeds of his £128,000 deception into off-shore bank accounts and used it to buy property in Germany.

Lam's lawyer said he was solely responsible for the offending.

His barrister said Lam turned to fraud after being made redundant from a job in IT and running up gambling debts without his wife knowing.

She said he was introduced to people at a casino who gave him the idea of committing fraud on-line.

Detective Sergeant Tom Walsh, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'It is obviously very unusual for officers to come across such a large amount of gold and silver bullion while searching a flat in Leeds city centre.

'Our investigation uncovered evidence which showed that Szymon Lam was living a lifestyle way beyond his legitimate means and one which therefore could only have been funded by crime.'
