Eight competitive rounds to the Masters and Rory McIlroy is determined to get back on track after the rude awakening of a rare missed cut at the Honda Classic last week.

‘Sometimes a kick up the backside can do you a world of good, and I want to do well in these next two events,’ said the world No 1, who will tee off alongside world No 2 Bubba Watson and No 3 Henrik Stenson in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday.

The 25-year-old took advantage of some unexpected time off to take his mum Rosie out for a birthday treat last Friday night before getting down to some serious hard practice over the weekend.

‘I guess coming off a three-week break you’re never quite sure how your game is going to be, and I just wasn’t comfortable playing the shots I needed to play in the wind,’ said McIlroy.

‘Now I’m excited to get back at it and obviously put in a better performance. I’ve worked on those wind shots and I feel in a better place and probably a little more prepared than I was last week.’

On Monday, McIlroy turned up at the renowned Seminole club in south Florida for their fabled member-guest event. He walked through the locker room and studied the names on the winner’s board. 

Men with names like Snead and Hogan. Nicklaus, Palmer and Woods. ‘It would be cool to have my name up there,’ he thought to himself and well, you can probably guess what happened next. The four-time major champion breezed round in 63 and won by two strokes.

Now it is the first World Golf Championship event of the season featuring every single member of the world’s top 50. ‘I don’t know whether it’s important for me to be going to the Masters at the top of my form,’ said McIlroy. ‘I’ve won majors when not playing well leading up to them. But I know one thing for sure. I’d much rather be going there with a win or a good performance under my belt.’

When he has finished here, McIlroy will head up to Augusta with his dad Gerry before playing his final competitive event ahead of his first tilt at a career grand slam. That event will be at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill.

McIlroy was not the only one to leave West Palm Beach last week determined to make amends here. How about Ian Poulter, who bossed a good field in terms of shotmaking but squandered a golden opportunity to claim his first strokeplay triumph on American soil?

Poulter put no fewer than five balls into the water during his final round to miss out on the sudden death play-off by a stroke. Now he finds himself on a course laden with so many water hazards it is known as the Blue Monster. Any prospect of a watery hangover, therefore? The ever-confident one gave short shrift to the notion.

‘Do you think I will have suddenly developed a phobia for water?’ he asked, aghast. ‘Come on. I’m holding a bottle of water for heaven’s sake!

‘Honestly, I couldn’t care less there’s water everywhere. This is a course where you’ve got to hit your targets and yes, if you miss them and hit bad shots then chances are that your ball is going to finish up wet.

‘But I’m going into this tournament having led the field last week in greens in regulation and shots that finished closest to the hole.

‘Yes, it’s a tournament I should have won and I’m devastated in some ways that I didn’t. But I haven’t spent the time since wallowing on the sofa or worrying about the three or four loose shots that cost me.

Poulter found the water no less than five times as he missed out on a play off at the Honda Classic

Poulter insists he has put the slump behind him and is fitter than ever heading into the WGC at Doral

‘Time to move on and enjoy the fact I’m fitter than I’ve been for some time. I did some tests last week and the strength in my shoulder area is 75 per cent greater than last year, when I was struggling with injuries. No, it doesn’t mean I’m going to hit the ball 75 per cent further but it does mean I’m going to be able to cope better with the rigours of a long season and be able to hit the number of practice balls on the range that I want to.’

Poulter was speaking at the official announcement that he will be the host when the British Masters, with Sky Sports as presenting sponsor, is relaunched in October.

If that welcome development sounds familiar, it is because Sportsmail broke the news last November. As we revealed back then, Poulter will be followed in future years as host by Justin Rose, Lee Westwood and Luke Donald.
