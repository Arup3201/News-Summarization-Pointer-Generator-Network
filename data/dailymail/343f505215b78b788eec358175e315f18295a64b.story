The England team touched down in England on Tuesday afternoon following a winning start to their Euro 2016 campaign with a 2-0 victory against Switzerland.

New Arsenal signing Danny Welbeck was all smiles as he got off the plane, but Gunners fans might be slightly disappointed to see the striker still clinging on his old Manchester United washbag.

The 23-year-old striker signed for Arsenal in a £16million deal on transfer deadline day, but has seemingly not had time to pick up any Arsenal merchandise.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger may need to kit his new player out with the latest Gunners gear.

If it's a new washbag Welbeck needs, Wenger just needs to long onto Arsenal's official website and fork out between £20 and £30 to ensure the striker doesn't go without this season. 

Welbeck bagged a brace on Monday night as Roy Hodgson's side won the opening game of their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

England captain  Wayne Rooney left the plane with Notts County chief executive Jim Rodwell, who made his FA international committee debut in Switzerland as part of the England party.

Speaking England's win, Hodgson said: 'On Monday the players proved what I have been trying to say all along.

'They proved that - yes the World Cup didn't go our way, and we were very disappointed, but we have been building, we have been changing players, introducing new ones, so it wasn't a question of us suddenly hitting a brick wall (in Brazil). It wasn't a case of - all of a sudden this is all wrong, we have to do something different.

'It was a question of maintaining faith that we're on the right track, that we were getting the right players in the team.

'These young players will be good players without a shadow of a doubt so it was important to get off to a good start against the team in the group which people will be thinking are our biggest rivals.'

Hodgson was also happy that his players maintained their desire to play for England despite the win-less campaign in Brazil.

'The one thing about these players, and I hope the public understand this, is that they all have a burning desire to play for England,' the 67-year-old added.
