Michael Le Vell revealed last night that he forgives the teenager who falsely accused him of rape - despite believing that the girl's mother is 'hell bent' on destroying him.

The 48-year-old Coronation Street star - who was dramatically cleared of rape and indecent assault last week - told his family that he thinks his two-year ordeal was the result of a vindictive campaign.

But he added: 'I know I am a good man and an innocent man, now the world knows that too. In time I do think I will be strong enough to forgive.'

verdict with family and friends. His sisters said he is ready to 
forgive the teenage girl who accused him of rape

The comments by the actor, whose real name is Michael Turner, were revealed in an interview given by his sisters Susan Westcott and Glenis Gill.

Charged with five counts of rape, three of indecent assault, two counts of sexual activity with a child and two of causing a child to engage in sexual activity, Le Vell always maintained his innocence.

His accuser, who cannot be named and who gave 
evidence from behind a screen, sobbed as she told Manchester Crown Court that the actor had repeatedly abused her over a period of nine years.

But at the end of an eight-day trial a jury exonerated Le Vell, delivering not guilty verdicts to all 12 charges after just five hours of deliberation.

Mrs Glenis, 60, told the Sunday Mirror how
the family were left 'shattered' by the allegations her brother faced. 
'I think the girl's mother deliberately set out to destroy Michael,' she
said. 'It was vindictive. She was hell bent on destroying Michael.'

Mrs
Westcott added: 'We knew from the start the allegations were rubbish - 
utter nonsense. Michael is not capable of such things. It would take a 
monster to do what they said. And Michael is no monster.'

Meanwhile, Le Vell's brother Phil Turner told The Sun on Sunday: ‘He is so forgiving, after everything he's been through. He is a guy who can turn the other cheek. He forgives in a moment. He can forgive the person making the allegations for sure, without a doubt.

'His exact words when I was with him yesterday were: “If she walked in here I would say, why has all this come about?” The lies against Michael are a hard thing for anyone to forgive - but he has done that.’

During the week-long trial, Le Vell 
was forced to open up about intimate details of his private life, 
admitting to being an alcoholic who cheated on his wife, Janette 
Beverley, 45, whom he left as she battled with breast cancer.

child to engage in sexual activity

The
case against the actor was initially dropped by the Crown Prosecution 
Service in January 2012 due to a lack of evidence, after he was arrested
in September 2011.

Michael Le Vell met with Coronation Street producers on Thursday to discuss his return to the ITV soap.

The
48-year-old actor is set to make his comeback as Kevin Webster, after 
being cleared of child-sex charges in a trial which ended this week.

Reports suggest the soap star met with bosses to discuss a new deal thought to be worth around £250,000 a year.

The
Mirror reported that Michael, who has not appeared in the soap since 
February, is expected to make a decision about his return in the coming 
days, as he considers the deal over the weekend.

Michael’s
return to the soap, which he has starred in since 1983, is said to be 
contingent on the actor’s drinking habits after he admitted to being an 
alcoholic during his trial.

‘Michael
is an absolute professional,’ a source told The Mirror, ‘but he 
needs to resolve issues in his life – and his dependency on alcohol is a
problem that must be addressed.’

But on 
February 14 this year Alison Levitt QC, principal legal adviser to the 
Director of Public Prosecutions, announced that she had reviewed the 
decision and authorised Greater Manchester Police to charge Le Vell.

Now
facing the the mammoth task of rebuilding his life and reputation, Le 
Vell met with Coronation Street producers on Thursday to discuss his 
return 
to the ITV soap and is also planning to sue the CPS to recoup his legal 
costs.

A friend of the actor
told The Mail On Sunday he planned to ‘fight’ for justice, adding: 
‘Mike and his entire family have suffered – not just mentally but 
financially throughout this farcical trial.

‘It
is not just the substantial legal fees to worry about – there is also 
the damaging effect the trial will have on him for the rest of his life 
and career.

‘There have been
early discussions between him and his legal counsel and they have 
agreed that they have not finished working together.’

Le Vell's sisters also revealed that is also gearing up to the difficult task of rebuilding his relationship with his son and daughter, who he has not seen since the allegations emerged.

Mrs Westcott told how Christmas and birthdays had been especially difficult for Le Vell, and that he had missed not being able to go to watch his son play football.

But despite the ordeal, Mrs Gill added, their brother was beginning to recover some of his previous love for life, returning to what she described as his 'cheeky-chappy self'.
