Cronulla Sharks captain Paul Gallen has lashed out at NRL chiefs in an expletive-laden tweet about the sacking of Cronulla chief executive Steve Noyce.

Noyce was fired on Wednesday, leaving the 2014 wooden spooners without a CEO or coach. The team is also also under investigation by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority.

In the post on his Twitter account early on Thursday, Gallen, who is holidaying in Hawaii wrote: 'Steve Noice (sic) actually cared about players from cronulla's feelings. Couldn't say that about any other c*** from Nrl'.

After removing the controversial post, Gallen posted the above image on Instagram with the message: '4 drinks for $5 RSA. OMG no wonder I'm hung. Good times. Time to fly home'.

Gallen removed the post after several users advised him to take it down.

He later posted an image on Instagram with Sydney Roosters halfback Mitchell Pearce, and the message: '4 drinks for $5 RSA. OMG no wonder I'm hung. Good times. Time to fly home'.

Users have taken to social media to address the controversial tweet. 

Crowdiegal said: ‏'I'm sorry but if I said what Paul Gallen said about my bosses ... I'd be sacked. He is very lucky to still have a job right now imo'.

Others have shown their support for Gallen, with Samuel Abbs writing: 'Good on Paul Gallen, someone should of (sic) said that months ago,truth hurts.'

Gallen is no stranger to dramas on social media.

Last year he had a spat with veteran NRL coach Brian Smith in an acrimonious exchange on Twitter, after the former Sydney Roosters mentor accused him of running away from Dylan Napa after a brutal hit from the Tricolours prop.

A number of the messages that appeared on Gallen's account during the exchange were later credited to his father Garry.

Noyce joined the Sharks as football manager in April last year, before taking over the chief executive's role soon after. 

The sharks are currently under investigation by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority for their 2011 season supplement program.

Gallen suffered a backdated ban that is due to expire on November 23, meaning he will miss the upcoming international Four Nations tournament.

The Sydney Morning Herald has reported that Noyce was known to have been very supportive to players, in particular Gallen, during the controversial investigations.
