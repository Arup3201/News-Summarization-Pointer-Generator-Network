A CIA officer at the centre of the Colombian prostitute scandal has been accused of playing away from home again - by a woman he met while he was protecting President Obama during an official visit to Ireland.

Secret Service Agent Arthur Huntington is alleged to have lied about being divorced to bed a Canadian woman he met in Dublin, where he had been assigned as part of the President's security team during his trip to the Irish capital in May 2011.

The woman, who only agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, said the CIA officer's wife 'deserves to know' about the liaison because his indiscretions were 'not a one-time thing'.

Scene: The altercation between the prostitute and the agent occurred at Cartegena's Hotel Caribe when the President was in the country for a summit

It wasn't until months later, when news broke of the scandal involving him and a prostitute from Cartegena, she realised he had lied to her, she has claimed.

The 42-year-old woman, a single mother-of-two, claims she felt 'sick' and 'used' when she discovered his dalliance with the hooker - and that he was married and living in Maryland with his wife and children.

She claims she 'never would have gone near him' had she known the truth about the agent, the New York Daily News reported.

She has described in detail the night Huntington allegedly came on to her in a Dublin pub, with the line: 'You're not getting away from me tonight.'

The brunette said while he did not try to bed her that night, 41-year-old Huntington then pursued her by email for months until the pair met in Manhattan for a two-day tryst in August last year.

She claimed Huntington told her he was a divorced father-of-two and he bedded her in the Marriott East Side, on Lexington Avenue in New York.

She told the New York Daily News: 'Why is it the President is the only one that should have morals? The people that are protecting him should be mindful of what they are doing.

'He’s under a microscope now because he’s put himself there. '(His) job is more than a job. It’s a responsibility.

'I feel used. He actively pursued me while he was married - and not only me. How many more others?'

She said she continued to keep in touch with the CIA officer until his Colombia trip last month. Shortly afterwards she discovered the truth.

Huntington sparked the prostitution scandal in Colombia in April, which brought shame on Obama's administration.

The Secret Service Agent spent the night with Dania Suarez while on duty in South America but paid only $28 of his $800 tab,

His encounter with the escort led to police being called to the luxury Hotel Caribe, and subsequently a major Secret Service investigation where nine agents lost their jobs.

The scandal overshadowed Barack Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas.

The Canadian woman said the only good thing she could say about Huntington was that he paid for her dinners and drinks - in contrast to his actions in Cartegena, she told the New York Daily News.
