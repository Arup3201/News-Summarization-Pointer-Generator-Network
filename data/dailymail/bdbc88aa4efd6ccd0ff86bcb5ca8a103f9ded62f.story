A mother today revealed her shock at how her 'micro' pig - who weighed just 7lbs when she bought him four years ago - has grown at such a rapid rate that he is now a whopping 21-stone beast.

Donna Davidson, 46, of Leicester, bought Taz when he was tiny - but he kept on growing, to tip the scales at more than 300lbs and only just fitting in her small garden.

Now, Leicester City Council has declared that Taz is officially classed as a farmyard animal - and after receiving complaints from neighbours, officials have told Miss Davidson that Taz has to go.

Whopping size: Donna Davidson, of Leicester, watched Taz grow over four years to weigh more than 300lbs

Early days: When Ms Davidson bought Taz he only weighed 7lbs - and was sold to her as a 'micro-deluxe' pig

Under threat: The 46-year-old woman has been told by Leicester City Council that Taz the pig has to go

She said: ‘When I bought him he only weighed 7lbs and was sold to me as a micro-deluxe. He was smaller than my Jack Russell. It's clear now that's not the case but I still love him.

‘In fact, the bigger the pig, the more there is to love. I'll never give him up. I don't look at him like an animal - he's a part of the family. I treat him like he's one of my children.’

Miss Davidson is looking for a new council home for her and her son, 20, and his brother, 21, but she cannot go on the waiting list for most authorities as she does not already live in the area.

Another stumbling block is that many private landlords are concerned that her other pets - three dogs, two ferrets and two tortoises - might be a threat to any animals on nearby farmland.

But Miss Davidson has vowed to never give up Taz and refuses to leave him behind. The pampered pig even has toys and loves his children's music box which plays a song that he goes to sleep to.

She added: ‘Looking for a new place to live for all of us is a nightmare. I've applied to every single council in Leicestershire and had no luck so now I'm searching further afield.

‘I'm hoping I might have a better chance 
somewhere rural places in the middle of nowhere that will let me keep my
 animals. I'm an animal lover and I've got to keep us all together.

'The bigger the pig, the more there is to love. I'll never give him up. I don't look at him like an animal - he's a part of the family'

Donna Davidson

‘There's not an animal on this planet that I don't like but I've loved pigs since I was a small child. He's got a baby's music box with colourful buttons and he presses them at night to get a song. If the music finishes before he's asleep, he pushes the buttons again. He absolutely loves music.’

A council spokesman said: ‘We visited this tenant after a complaint about animals at the property and advised her that keeping farm animals is a breach of her tenancy agreement. We will revisit next week to assess the situation.

'Our focus is on encouraging this tenant to find a suitable home for the pig and we have not yet started eviction proceedings. We are trying to rehome the pig.’
