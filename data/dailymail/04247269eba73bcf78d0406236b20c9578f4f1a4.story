British women now spend a staggering £450 a year EACH on their nails as they copy stars from the cast of TOWIE to music icons like Rihanna, new research reveals.

And they are spending more on their nails than their hair as the trend for gel and acrylic extensions continues to boom across the country, it added.

It is now so popular that more women go out wearing fake nails than their real ones, whether it is for night on the town to a job interview.

Groomed: British women now spend an average of £450 each on getting their nails done

Beauty industry experts, Original Additions, surveyed 1,500 women aged between 20 and 45 and spoke to 2,000 salon owners for their research.

While many women will get their nails 
done every time they prepare for a night out on the town, it is not just
for social reasons that fake nails and manicures are booming.

The increase in tablet computers and 
smartphones, texting and emails, not to mention PC keyboards at work, 
mean a lot more wear and tear on the fingers of millions of women.

Celebrities
are a growing influence with the perma-tanned
stars of reality TV shows like TOWIE and Geordie Shore to A-listers 
like Rihanna and Beyonce among those mentioned.

So addicted to perfectly groomed nails are celebrities, that Victoria
Beckham even flew UK nail technician Michelle Class all the way to the 
US to work on the nails of models wearing the ex-Spice Girl's designs 
during New York fashion week.

Hollywood style: Celebrities such as Rita Ora and Victoria Beckham are part of the reason for the boom

Glamorous: The seriously groomed girls from The Only Way is Essex have also influenced British consumers

Class said: 'Due to the recent 
boom in high street nail bars women are now consistently incorporating 
manicures into their grooming routine.

'Nails have become an essential expression of individual style and are now considered the defining accessory of an outfit. For instance, my client Rita Ora is now synonymous with long, red stiletto nails.

'Women
have realised that your nails speak volumes about how much pride and 
care you take in your appearance and so more than ever, everyone is 
getting affordable, professional looking nails in salon and at home.'

More than seven in ten women would not go on a date without attractive nails and 86 per cent 
would not attend an interview with chipped nails.

An overwhelming 96 per cent of women say they feel better about themselves when they have had their nails done.

Boom: British women now spend more on their nails - good news for brands like Elegant Touch

The average woman goes 
to a nail salon twice a month and the most popular treatment is for a French manicure.

Women in London are most likely to stick
to plain red nails while those elsewhere are more likely to try wacky or innovative designs.

Many also supplement the look with less 
expensive, press on nails by brands such as Elegant Touch, or Nail Rock, which can cost as little as £6 a set.

A spokesperson from Original Addition’s gel polish brand Gellux added: ‘Nail polish is a way to express yourself.

'Your favourite polish hue says a lot about you and what image you want to present to the world.'

Colour choice varies wildly depending on which part of the UK you live in. According to the Original Additions survey, Londoners favoured classic red and nudes, while Liverpool ladies love bright coral pink.

The white-tipped French manicure topped the charts in Essex, while those living in the rest of the home counties tended to choose fuschia pink.

Surprisingly, Newcastle's favourite colour was demure pale pink, while Manchester girls chose two chic shades: scarlet and taupe. So what does your colour choice say about you? The Gellux experts have the answer:

Red: Scarlet nails have a regal feel and are worn by glamorous women, who tend to want to get noticed by men. Most popular in London and South Manchester. 

Coral: If you sport bright nails, you are an energetic and confident girl who isn't afraid of the spotlight. Most popular in Liverpool and London.

Taupe: If you rock dove grey or 
taupe nails, you're an androgynous, cool, fashion girl, who almost certainly lives in a big city. Most popular in London, Leeds and Manchester.

French manicure: The classic 
French tip has been revamped and is blingier than ever. No prizes for guessing that Essex loves this look more than anywhere else, with many TOWIE types adding Swarovski 
crystals to the tips. Most popular in Essex, London and Birmingham.

Hot pink: Fuchsia pink nails are for
the classy and composed girl. This 'no-nonsense' nail enhances the act 
of flipping through fashion magazines and organising school events. Most popular in the Home counties and Leicester.

Pale pink: Pink nails are for light-hearted, optimistic girls who want their hands to reflect their fun side. Most popular in Newcastle and along the south coast.
