The bodies of three women have been found locked inside a cabin in a German wood after a possible suicide pact arranged through a social networking site.

Police found the trio shut in the bathroom of the holiday hut at a campsite on the shores Edersee, a reservoir and beauty spot, 100 miles north of Frankfurt, western Germany, on Wednesday night.

Detectives said the women, aged 49, 44 and 23, each left a note and that they are not hunting anyone in connection with the deaths.

Cabin in the woods: Police found the trio shut in the bathroom of the holiday hut at a campsite on the shores Edersee, a reservoir and beauty spot 100 miles north of Frankfurt, western Germany, on Wednesday night

Suicide chatroom: Detectives said the women, aged 49, 44 and 23, each left a note and that they are not hunting anyone in connection with the deaths

The women were found when the owner of the cabin grew worried, having not seen them for two days, and entered the cabin to find a warning light flashing on a carbon monoxide detector.

When officers entered the cabin they were forced to flood the inside with oxygen before discovering the bodies lying in the bathroom.

Police were unable to disclose any possible motives for the tragedy, but said in a statement that it may have been the result of 'mental illness'.

The oldest of the women, from Frankfurt Oder in eastern Germany, had rented the property for two nights on Monday.

No motive: Police were unable to disclose any possible motives for the tragedy, but said in a statement that it may have been the result of 'mental illness'

A 44-year-old woman from nearby Kassel and a 23-year-old woman from Potsdam, near Berlin, also died.

'The backgrounds of the joint suicide victims have not been investigated yet, but we will look into mental illness,' Volker Konig, a chief inspector in the Northern Hesse Police, said.

'According to our investigations, the three women got to know each other in online social networks and agreed to go to the campsite. We do not know whether they knew each other before.'

Beauty spot: Asked whether he knew why they came from across Germany to Edersee, a police spokesman suggested that it was perhaps chosen because of its reputation as one of the country's foremost beauty spots

Asked whether he knew why they came from across Germany to Edersee, Mr Konig suggested that it was perhaps chosen because of its reputation as one of the country's foremost beauty spots.

'Maybe they were looking for a nice place to spend their final hours,' he said.

The case has shades of a 2011 online suicide pact that shocked Germany when three teenage girls, aged 16, 18 and 19,Â  from different parts of Germany, arranged to meet up to kill themselves 
after making plans in an internet chatroom called 'Suicide Area'.

They
 agreed to meet at the railway station in Osnabruck, northwest Germany, 
after telling their parents that they were going on a camping weekend 
with friends, and took a taxi into the forest near the town of Damme.

The taxi driver even helped them pitch the tent in which they were found lying side by side.

The mother of one of the girls, named only as Stephanie A., from Jena, eastern Germany, told Der Spiegel at the time: 'She led a double life for years. She
 was outwardly cheerful and inwardly broken - and I suspected nothing.'
