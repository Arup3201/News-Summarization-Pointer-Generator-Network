A father of five has died after being dragged out of a house before being beaten and shot in the leg by at least three masked men.

Brian McIlhagga, 42, died after being attacked by the men who forced their way into his friend's house in Ballymoney in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, last night.

Mr McIlhagga, a plasterer, was dragged out of the property - in a quiet cul-de-sac - beaten and shot once in the leg in the front garden.

Despite frantic resuscitation efforts by neighbours, he died at the scene.

His friend, a 32-year-old woman, who he was visiting when he was attacked, was also beaten by the masked men and forced to lie on the kitchen floor while the shooting took place outside. She was taken to hospital where she is said to be recovering from non life-threatening injuries.

The women's four children, all aged 13 or under, were in the house when the gang burst in but it is understand that they didn't witness the killing.

Chief inspector Michael Harvey, of Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) who is leading the investigation, said: 'Brian McIlhagga was dragged from the kitchen, down the hallway and out through the front door of the house.

'He was beaten and then shot once in the leg outside the house.

'Tragically, he died at the scene as a result of the injuries inflicted during the attack. 

'We are waiting for a post mortem examination to take place to determine the exact cause of death. 

 'This was a vicious, brutal and sustained attack on a man who was visiting his friend.

'It is unusual for a town like Ballymoney and I understand how the community is shocked by what has happened.

'Mr McIlhagga was a friend of the woman who lived in the house at Riverview Park and had been a visitor in recent months.

Forensic experts were collecting evidence at the scene today as police confirmed the father of five's death was being treated as a murder enquiry. His friend, a 32-year-old woman, was also injured in last night's attack

'The woman has four children, all under 13, and they were in the house last night.' 

A motive has yet to be established and the PSNI has not ruled out the involvement of paramilitaries.

Mr Harvey added: 'I have no information to rule in or rule out paramilitaries or any other motives for this attack.'

Police have not yet disclosed what type of weapon was used or whether other instruments were used during the beatings. However, they confirmed a full murder investigation was underway.

Officers have set up a dedicated incident room at Ballymoney Police Station and are urging members of the public to come forward with information.

Mr Harvey said: 'I would appeal for anyone who was in the area of 10 Riverview Park between 10 and 11pm [last night] who saw any persons or any vehicles to contact detectives.

'Enquiries are at a very early stage. But, I would appeal to the local community to contact detectives.

'The victim has a minor criminal record but, he is certainly not a major criminal.'

Detective chief inspector Richard Campbell added:  'I would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed this murder, saw any suspicious activity in the area or has any information to contact detectives at Ballymoney on 101 or crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'
