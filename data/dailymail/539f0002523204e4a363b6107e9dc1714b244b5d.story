A man was arrested after he opened the emergency exit on board a plane 'to get off quicker.'

Shortly after the China Eastern flight MU2331 from Xi’an arrived at Sanya Fenghaung International Airport in Hainan, the impatient Chinese passenger made for an alternative exit out.

By activating the emergency exit, he deployed the emergency slide; the whole event caused an almost two-hour delay to the flight.

When asked why he had broken the rules, the passenger replied by saying he had 'wanted to get off the plane quicker.'

He also claimed he had not listened to the in-flight instructions, saying that he was not aware you couldn't use the emergency exit to disembark.

The on-board flight attendants tried in vain to prevent the slide from deploying, but were caught short.

The cost of the Chinese man's actions are thought to have amounted to around £10,000

The man's actions, not only caused delays to his fellow passengers, but is also estimated to have cost the airline £10,000 ($15,724). 

The incident comes only days after a Chinese woman scalded a flight attendant by throwing a cup of hot noodles after finding out she wouldn't be sat next to her boyfriend.

The incident occurred on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China, and passengers were on hand to pull out their smartphones as the mid-air drama unfolded in front of them, snapping pictures as the injured flight attendant covered her face and shouted in pain. 

During the chaos a man believed to be the woman's boyfriend jumped out of his seat and angrily threatened to blow up the plane as the injured flight attendant was tended to by her co-workers.

But the man accused of making the threat later said the attendant was scalded by accident during a tussle over a receipt they had requested for the hot water.
