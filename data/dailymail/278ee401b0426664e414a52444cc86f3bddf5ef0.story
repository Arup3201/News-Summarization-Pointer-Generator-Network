Former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell doesn't think Alexis Sanchez is the man to fire the Gunners to title glory. 

The Chilean forward arrived in a £30 million deal from Barcelona this summer and boss Arsene Wenger hopes he's the man to help end a 10-year Premier League title drought. 

But speaking to the Weekend Sports Breakfast on talkSPORT, Campbell claims Wenger hasn't addressed the deficiencies in his squad - namely a reliable goalscorer and midfield powerhouse.  

Leading the line: Kevin Campbell doubts whether Alexis Sanchez will solve Arsenal's problems 

He said: 'Alexis Sanchez is a fantastic signing but I don't think the problems have really been addressed.

'I like the Calum Chambers signing but he's going to take a bit of time to bed in. The two main problems were the centre of the pitch and a noted goalscorer and they haven't addressed that problem. 

'If you struggled against the top boys and you don't address the problems, then you can't expect a different result in my opinion.'

As well as Sanchez, Wenger has brought in Chambers in for £12 million from Southampton and French defender Mathieu Debuchy arrived for £10 million from Newcastle.

New kid on the block: Sanchez is expected to be a key player for Arsenal this season as they chase glory 

But attempts to sign World Cup winning Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira has failed and Campbell, who also played for Everton and Nottingham Forest, said the Gunners are still short in the middle of the park. 

And Campbell questions whether the former Barcelona man, who scored 21 goals in all competitions for the Catalans last season, has the physical attributes to lead the line in English football. 

He said: 'Coming from Barcelona is different to playing in the Premier League. 

'Sanchez is going to get a lot more physical pressure against him, so I don't see him as being a centre forward who can take the hits. 

'I don't see him being that central striker.' 

Arsenal verdict: Kevin Campbell takes on Oldham during his time with the Gunners and will follow his former club keenly this season 

Campbell scored 59 goals in 228 games for the Gunners from 1988 until leaving for Nottingham Forest in 1995. 

Sanchez played the full 90 minutes as Arsenal beat Crystal Palace 2-1 on the opening day of the Premier League season.
