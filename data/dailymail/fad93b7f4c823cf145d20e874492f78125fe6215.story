A friend of Jewish schoolgirl Anne Frank has told of the moment the two were reunited at a Nazi concentration camp - where she found her 15-year-old friend emaciated and wrapped only in blankets as she struggled to survive the camp's harsh conditions.

Nanette Konig, 85, had known Anne from school and had attended the teenager's birthday party where she received the infamous diary in which she went on to detail her life hiding from the Nazis.

After being captured, the classmates spent around two years apart before being reunited in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.

Recalling their chance encounter within the camp, Mrs Konig said: 'She was depleted, wrapped in blankets because her clothes were full of lice.

'It was really awful because she had completely wasted away. There was nothing left of her. Even today I don't know how we two skeletons could have recognised each other.'

Now Mrs Konig pays tribute to Anne, who died aged 15, just weeks before the camp was liberated 70 years ago.

The pair were just two of the millions of Jews rounded up into concentration camps following persecution from the Nazis. More than six million Jews were killed worldwide in the genocide.

Anne's parents Margot and Otto Frank were deported to a transit camp with Anne and her sister Margot and then on to Auschwitz.

When Anne and her sister were taken to Bergen-Belsen in October that year, Mrs Konig spotted her friend through a barbed wire fence.

Mrs Konig said: 'I saw Anne walking on the other side of some barbed wire.

'I couldn't go near it though, I would have been tortured or killed.'

But when the wire was taken down and Mrs Konig next spotted her friend, she grabbed Anne's attention and the girls met up to talk several times.

'I am the only one in that class who met her again in Bergen-Belsen. I was in camp seven and she was in camp eight.

'I met her several times and it was from Anne that I learnt what was happening in Auschwitz.

'She told me about her diary and that she wanted to use it for a book after the war, she never wanted to publish a diary.

'We talked about her going in to hiding, how hard life was in the hiding place.'

Mrs Konig recalled how the girls were aware of the terrifying circumstances they were in.

Anne Frank died aged 15 at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Her diary detailing the time her family spent hiding from the Nazis has sold more than 30million copies

She said: 'We were dreaming and we had to hope we would make it through. It was part of our survival.

'We were mature - the circumstances made us like that. We had all lost family and didn't know if we'd see them again. Everyone wanted to survive, nobody wanted to die willingly.'

Anne's diary was first published in 1947 and has been translated into 67 languages with more than 30 million copies sold.

Recalling the moment Anne received her gift as a birthday present, Mrs Konig said: 'Anne wanted to use the pages of her diary to write a book.

'We were dreaming of the future, it was part of our survival.

'She always wanted to be seen and heard. Anne was a girl who was full of life, she loved to talk and liked the boys.

'If she was still alive, I am convinced that she would have become an excellent writer. In the end, she got her wish to be a published author.' 

Mrs Konig, who was one of 60,000 survivors liberated from Bergen-Belsen by British forces.

'I saw Anne shortly before she died,' Mrs Jonig said. 'Bergen-Belsen wasn't a death camp but the conditions eliminated people. It's very emotional. She didn't make it and I did. I still see her in front of me.'

Mrs Konig, who now lives in Sao Paolo, Brazil, with her husband, John, went to school with Anne Frank in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation.

In 1941, they were classmates at the Jewish Lyceum, a school for Jewish children no longer allowed to attend normal schools.

The Frank family had already fled Germany following persecution and moved to the Netherlands along with 300,000 other German Jews.

The pupils in these schools were taught by Jewish teachers who had been removed from their posts at normal schools.

Mrs Konig said: 'I sat behind Anne in class and we were friends. I remember she always wanted to be seen and heard.

'We were all friends in class. We were aware of the circumstances so we all supported each other.

'You knew leaving the house, you might not make it back.'

By March 1942, thousands of Jews had been persecuted and the first trainload had reached Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland.

The curfew enforced between 8pm to 6am meant that the children were unable to see each other in the evenings.

But on 12 June 1942, the children in Mrs Konig's class got the chance to spend time together when Anne turned 13 years old.

At that birthday party Mrs Konig watched Anne open her parent's present - a diary.

She said: 'All of our classmates were there. I remember some films were projected onto the walls – for us it was such a novelty.'

In July that year, Anne Frank's family disappeared leaving a note claiming they were moving to Switzerland.

Instead they went into hiding inside Anne's father Otto's jam business.

Jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their clothes to identify them and were routinely rounded up to be shipped to concentration camps.

The family stayed undetected for two years inside the secret complex, hidden on the top floor of the business.

In February 1944, Mrs Konig was taken to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, unsure whether she would ever see her friend again.

In August 1944, everyone hiding in the secret annex inside the business was arrested.

The family had been betrayed but it has never been established by who.

Auschwitz (pictured) was used as a death camp by the Nazis during the Second World War. Although Anne was transferred out of the prison, she later died at Bergen-Belsen

She remembers the roll calls at the camp.

'They made us stand for 36 hours,' Mrs Konig said. 'They pulled me out and when they did I began to shake because I did not know what would happen.

'I was really lucky because the officer fired into the air and sent me back into the row without torturing or killing me. I survived by pure chance.'

When she was able to, Anne talked to her friend about wanting to become a published author.

But she would not live to turn her diary in to a book herself.

In March 1945, Anne and Margot both contracted typhus - a bacteria carried by lice and ticks - just three weeks short of the British forces liberating the camp.

After the war, Anne Frank's father Otto met with Mrs Konig and told her he was considering publishing his daughter's diary.

Mrs Konig recalled: 'I said, 'do it.' Then in 1947 the first diary was published. I think Anne would be pleased with it.'

Anne told Mrs Konig (pictured) that she always wanted to be a writer and hoped to publish her diary after the war had ended

In 1949, Mrs Konig moved to London, got a job as a bilingual secretary and shortly afterwards met her husband, John Konig, 88.

Two years later, they married and moved to South America together, to start a family.

The couple of 62 years have three children, Elizabeth, Judy and Martin.

Now Mrs Konig spends her time travelling around the world, giving presentations in schools and universities, to educate people about the Holocaust.

She said: 'If by chance you survived, you have a duty to speak for those who can't.

'So that the world knows the disaster to the Jewish community. But above all, so that a thing like the Holocaust never happens again.

'Two thirds of the community - nine million people - lost their lives.'
