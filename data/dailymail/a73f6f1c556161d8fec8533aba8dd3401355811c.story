A 33-year-old mother of six is fighting for her life, after prematurely giving birth to a new baby boy last week as she battles a deadly form of skin cancer.

Kathy Taylor of Bear River, Utah had melanoma removed from her back seven years ago, but at the end of July the cancer came back again aggressively. 

At the time, she was pregnant with her sixth child with husband Nathan Taylor, and declined treatment then so that she could continue supporting her son's life.

New life: Kathy's new baby Luke is currently being nursed in an NICU incubator. He was born last week at just 1 pound and 15 ounces

'She was doing everything in her power to hold that baby in her, so she could give him the protection and nourishment she needed to as a mommy,' mother-in-law Jocelyn Taylor told the Deseret News.

However, last Thursday the pain became too much and Mrs Taylor was rushed to the hospital where she was induced and gave birth to baby Luke at just 26 weeks.

Now, both mother and her 1-pound, 15-ounces son are fighting for life in the hospital. 

Hope: On Monday, Kathy began a new cancer treatment her family hopes will elongate her life so she can spend more time with her children

'She’s fading,' her mother-in-law said. 'She seems to have a foot in both worlds right now.'

The family is now holding onto hope that a new cancer treatment will prolong Kathy's life and give her more time with her children, especially the opportunity to hold baby Luke who is currently being nursed with an incubator in the NICU. 

Husband Nathan Taylor's oldest brother John  told MailOnline that some family members may be able to touch baby Luke in a few months. He will remain in the NICU until December 10.

This weekend, Kathy's oldest daughter Ally turned 10, and she was able to be there for the special day by Skyping from her hospital bed.

Her other five children have already been brought in to say goodbye to mom, according to the family's fundme page. 

The fund has been set up to pay for medical costs for both Kathy and her premature son. 

'Ultimately we are hopeful and we are going to pray. We've received so much support from the community and everybody but ultimately I feel like it might be her time,' John Taylor told MailOnline.
