One of the first Romanian immigrants to arrive in the UK after border controls were relaxed in January has complained that this country is too expensive.

Victor Spirescu became a minor celebrity earlier this year after being pictured with politicians after climbing off a plane at Luton airport.

At the time he said he came to London to send money back to his wife in Romania so he could start his own business, but now says he cannot make savings because the capital is too expensive.

Spirescu told the BBC that London rent is too high, and he is unhappy he has to pay so much on tax and transport (pictured having a coffee with Keith Vaz and fellow immigrant Julian Barbat, centre)

Speaking on the Today show on BBC Radio 4 he said: 'I haven't saved any money. It is very expensive here.

'I want to save some money to make my own business in Romania. I expected to save some money but no.

Spirescu said he believes the border was opened in January because the UK needs more workers, as all British men are at home on benefits

'I believe England opened the border because they need people to work. English guys are at home on benefits.

'I want to go home but I haven't saved any money. The system is wrong I pay too much tax, too much money for travel and rent it is too expensive to live in London.'

Spirescu arrived in the UK on New Year's Day and was treated to a Costa Coffee by LAbour Party politician Keith Vaz.

At the time he told reporters that he was not here 'to rob your country', adding that he wanted to get a job, earn money, and then go back to Romania with his wife.

He initially got a job washing cars in an Aldi car park in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, but quit after just one day to start a construction job at a building site in east London.

Since then he has announced plans to move his 19-year-old wife Catalina Curcean to the UK from their pig and sheep farm in Transylvania. It is not known whether she has joined him in this country.

Spirescu gained notoriety after his ex-girlfirend, a 26-year-old woman named Ana, claimed he was arrested and fined in Romania for attacking her in a car park.

The pair began dating in 2009 but she split up with him seven months later.

She eventually agreed to meet up with him again in a park in January 2010 after he had tried to contact her up to 40 times.  

Spirescu said he wanted to save money to send home to his wife Catalina Curcean in Transylvania, but he cannot afford to do it

When they met up, she said he launched his attack, punching her to the floor then hitting her repeatedly while she was on the ground.

It was reported that Spirescu was fined £600 and ordered to pay his ex-girlfriend £400 compensation in June 2011 by Bucharest's 3rd District Court following the incident.

In addition, he was given a 35 day suspended jail sentence.
