Yohan Cabaye is contemplating his future at Paris Saint-Germain and could leave the French capital, claims team-mate Javier Pastore.

The French international midfielder would attract interest from a host of Premier League clubs if he did decide to move in January, including Arsenal and Liverpool.

Newcastle United, who Cabaye left in a £20million deal in January, could also throw their hat into the ring as a possible destination for the Frenchman if he leaves PSG in search of first-team football.

France appearances: 34

The 29-year-old has started just seven games in all competitions for PSG this season, coming on as a substitute eight times, and has lost his place in the French national starting XI as a result of his lack of first-team football.

And team-mate Pastore believes Cabaye will consider leaving for pastures new in January if things do not change. 

The Argentine said: 'I don't think that he wants to leave but it's true that we have a lot of midfielders.

'I hope he will make the best possible choice for him: either leave to get a game or stay here and earn his place.'

Cabaye was considered a fans' favourite during his time on Tyneside.

He scored 18 goals in 93 appearances during his two-and-a-half seasons with the Magpies after arriving from Lille in the summer of 2011 in a £4.5m deal.
