Officials reminded gun owners to keep weapons locked at all times and out of reach of children.

The children were playing with the gun in the bedroom when it went off while their grandparents watched TV in the living room, according to wyff.com.

Tmorej's parents Jerome Christopher Smith and Tia Jacques Miller were not home at the time the child's death happened. Police would not say who fired the weapon.
