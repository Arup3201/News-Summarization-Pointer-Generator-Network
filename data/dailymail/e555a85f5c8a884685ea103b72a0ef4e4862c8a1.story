Martin Janson takes a picture with his mother Jennifer and father Cees before leaving for Canada last year

After finishing school, saving up the money he earned working three jobs and heading overseas to Canada to spend a year working at the Whistler ski resort, Martin Janson was having the time of his life.

His mum Jennifer describes her youngest child as 'happy and so vibrant' and 'an absolute treasure of a person' who never caused any trouble.

But last year when Jennifer and husband Cees answered the door of their home in Hawkesbury, NSW, on September 3 they were left in shock when they were notified that their 19-year-old son had died from a drug overdose, a lethal combination of cocaine and sleeping pills.

She has also spoken of how the family were affected by the drugs death of Sydney teenager Georgina Bartter, who overdosed on pills at a music festival last November. 

'As parents we had no concept, we had no idea he was doing this', Mrs Janson told Daily Mail Australia.

'There's lots of parents out there that will say "why didn't you know, surely you can tell".'

But she insisted the news left her, Martin's father Cees and his siblings Annekah and Russel completely floored.

'My daughter in particular is just devastated because she had no idea.

'She said to "if I'd known mum, I would have said something", Mrs Janson revealed.

Martin told his parents he had been promoted to 'ski concierge' for his efforts at the resort

Martin had been working at the resort he was staying at and on Monday nights, as it was the quietest night of the week, many of the staff would go out and party.

'The last Skype conversation we have with him was on the 31st of August, it was a Sunday.

'We were sitting outside, it was a beautiful day here just before Spring,' Mrs Janson recalled through tears.

'He was just so happy and vibrant.'

It was during this conversation Martin told his parents he was getting promoted to be a 'ski concierge', a 'coveted position' usually reserved for those who had been there much longer than three months.

The 19-year-old also mentioned he was planning to take a trip to Mexico during the summer in Canada.

'I hope Georgina and Martin are up in heaven together': Ms Janson says the death of Sydney teenager Georgina Bartter (pictured) had a profound impact on the family

'I was so upset, I said "don't go to Mexico it's so dangerous there and there's so many drugs",' Martin's mother said.

Facebook messages discovered after Martin's death painted a vastly different picture of the youngest Janson sibling, one who did take drugs despite telling his parents he didn't.

Mr and Mrs Janson sat their son down before he attended a music festival in the Hunter Valley month before his death and warned him of the dangers of taking drugs.

He swore he would stay away from them.

'As a parent it's such an eye-opener, how do you change that conversation with your child?' Mrs Janson asked.

The pathology results that came from the coroner said the combination of cocaine and a sleeping pill a friend gave him to help him sleep was a lethal mix.

When the news broke that another 19-year-old, Georgina Bartter, had died of a drug overdose at a music festival, Mrs Janson said it was a second devastating blow for the family.

Jennifer Janson wants to educate other parents and teenagers about drugs, describing her son Martin as 'an absolutel treasure of a person'

'It was so devastating, it was like we were going through the whole process of Martin dying again.

'For us it was like we've got to stop this, it can't happen again.

'I hope Georgina and Martin are up in heaven together.' 

Mrs Janson now hopes to get involved in drug education and is passionate about 'opening up the conversation' so no other parents have to experience what her family went through.

The Janson family will travel to Canada for the first anniversary of Martin's death this September, and visit his grave every week. Mrs Janson said finding out the day after that her son had died almost made it twice as difficult.

'Martin had died twice, he died on the second of September and then on the third of September when we were notified.

'He was an absolute treasure of a person, he bought so much life and love to our home and all our friends.

'His impact was everybody was massive, young and old, he was just that sort of person that people gravitate to.
