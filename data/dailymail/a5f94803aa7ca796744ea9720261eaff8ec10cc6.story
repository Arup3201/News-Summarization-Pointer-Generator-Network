Six James Bond toy cars designed by Corgi have been found in their original packaging nearly 50 years after they were intended for sale.

The models of Bond's Aston Martin DB5 were kept by a sales rep from the firm who should have distributed them to toy shops.

After being designed in 1964, in the wake of the classic Goldfinger film, in which Sean Connery starred as Bond, the six toys are expected to fetch around £8,000 when sold together at auction this week.

Goldfinger, which featured the famous line, 'No Mr Bond, I expect you to die!', was the first of the films to feature 007's gadget-laden silver car.

Corgi toys were introduced to the UK in 1956 when they were manufactured in Swansea, Wales.

As well as creating a range of James Bond toys, the company has also created models of the cars featuring in Batman and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang among other films.

While the Bond Aston Martin DB5 is widely considered its greatest design, other Corgi models are still auctioned for big money.

The Corgi 267 Batmobile, for instance, can sell for more than £500.

For a more modest fee, collectors can get a classic yellow Mini toy car or a Royal Mail van for less than £10 each.

In 2012, Corgi designed a new Aston Martin DB5, to go along with the release of new Bond film Skyfall.

The model costs £15.99 brand new from the firm.

Corgi sprayed the model motors gold and included an ejector seat, which launched a plastic figure villain through the roof at the flick of a switch.

They were found in the cellophane-wrapped boxes they were left in leaving the Corgi factory 49 years ago.

The cars even come with a letter sent by Corgi to toy shops, advising 'Mr Retailer' to point out to 'every young purchaser' that 'secret instructions' are hidden inside the box.

The instructions informed children how levers at the back and side of the car operated the bullet-proof rear windshield and machine guns that shot out from the front bumper.

Another lever also activated the spring-loaded sunroof, projecting the gun-wielding villain into the air.

Experts say the cars would decline in value when opened.

A single original car out of its box today sells for around £500.

Glen Chapman, of C&T Auctions of 
Rochester, Kent, said: 'To have these toy James Bond cars still in their
original packaging and having never been opened is exceptionally rare.

'They are in mint condition and are presented as if they had just come from the factory.

'We have decided to sell them as they have been for the last 50 years and that is as a trade pack in their sealed boxes.

'It would be terrible to open them. They should be treated as an investment and locked away in a safe, a bit like a fine wine.' 

Out of their original packaging, the Corgi cars usually sell for around £500

Mr Chapman added: 'They shouldn't really be given to a grandchild to open and play with that's for sure.

'They belonged to a Corgi sales rep for about 30 years. Either they were surplus stock or he just kept them.

'He sold them to a private collector 20 years ago and he has now made them available at auction.'

The cars are set to go up for auction tomorrow.
