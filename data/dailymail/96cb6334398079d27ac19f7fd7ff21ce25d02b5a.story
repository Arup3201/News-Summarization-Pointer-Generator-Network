Labour sent out mixed messages on Syria yesterday, with Ed Miliband striking a far more cautious tone than Tony Blair.

Mr Blair, now a Middle East ‘peace envoy’, called for a major Western intervention in Syria to prevent it becoming ‘mired in carnage’ and a ‘breeding ground for extremism’.

The former prime minister said he understood the ‘impulse to stay clear of the turmoil’.

But he added: ‘We have, collectively, to understand the consequences of wringing our hands not putting them to work.’ However, the current Labour leadership struck a much more cautious note.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said Labour would not give the Government a ‘blank cheque’ on Syria, despite the apparent use of chemical weapons by tyrant Bashar al-Assad last week.

Mr Alexander said Labour MPs could even be ordered to vote against military action if Mr Cameron fails to make the case in the Commons tomorrow.

‘We still don’t know what the Government’s strategic objective would be - how achievable that objective is,’ he said.

‘We don’t know the legal basis on which the Government would seek to be acting; we don’t know the international support that it would be seeking to galvanise.

'So there are very legitimate issues of real concern which I think we’ve got an obligation to be asking the Government in these critical days. I’m not ruling out the possibility that Labour could support the Government, but I’m certainly not prepared to write the Government a blank cheque.'

He went on: ‘If we weren’t convinced, yes we would whip MPs (against the Government) - it would be a party position in terms of the case that the Government had made. But frankly, we’re not at that stage because... we still haven’t had from the Government either the evidence or indeed the military objectives that it would need to set out before Parliament to try and justify the course of action that is apparently at least in contemplation.’

Mr Miliband was called in to Downing Street yesterday afternoon for a personal briefing on the Government’s plans, and the case for intervention.

Speaking afterwards, Mr Miliband said he was willing to ‘consider’ backing limited military action but did not offer a guarantee.

‘The use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians is abhorrent and cannot be ignored,’ Mr Miliband said.

‘When I saw the Prime Minister this afternoon I said to him the Labour Party would consider supporting international action but only on the basis that it was legal, that it was specifically limited to deterring the future use of chemical weapons and that any action contemplated had clear and achievable military goals.

‘We will be scrutinising any action contemplated on that basis.’

Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw acknowledged that the experience of the Iraq war had made MPs more sceptical about swallowing Government claims in the run-up to military action.

But he added: ‘There is an instinct in the British House of Commons to support a British prime minister, of whatever party, where he or she is recommending military action.

‘So that will be part of the instinct, but also there is no doubt that the experience of Iraq has raised the bar of scepticism by the British House of Commons on behalf of the British people about whether military action is justified.’
