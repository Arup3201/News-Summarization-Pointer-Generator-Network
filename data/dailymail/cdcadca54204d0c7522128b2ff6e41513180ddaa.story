The BBC pays 11 of its most senior bosses twice as much as the Prime Minister, it emerged yesterday.

A further 80 executives take home more than David Cameron’s £142,500-a-year salary.

When many of the corporation’s staff have seen annual pay rises of little more than 1 per cent, the 91 bosses are taking home a combined £19million a year including bonuses.

MPs said the figures would make hard-pressed families question the licence fee especially when programmes are facing the axe.

Top earners include Director-General Lord Hall, who earns £450,000, Anne Bulford, managing director of finance and operations, who is paid £395,000, and Peter Salmon, Director of England, who takes home £375,000.

The figures do not cover on-air stars, 39 of whom are paid more than £250,000 a year.

These include Graham Norton, who is reportedly paid £2.6million for presenting his BBC1 and Radio2 shows, and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, who is said to take home as much as £2million.

Even Paul Hollywood is paid a better wage than the Prime Minister, earning £300,000 for his work on The Great British Bake Off and its various spin-offs.

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The BBC has recently said they have cut their senior management to the bone and there are no more savings to be made there but it’s only at the BBC where you could cut senior management to the bone and end up with more people paid more than the Prime Minister than before you started.

‘It’s just extraordinary and goes to show how much fat there is.

‘What the BBC should do is be cutting out all of these managers, most of who if they disappeared no one would notice, and start delivering some value for money to the licence fee payer.’

Angie Bray, a Tory member of the Commons culture committee alongside Mr Davies, said: ‘It will be difficult for the BBC to continue to feel loved by the public if it continues to put licence payers’ money on salaries rather than on what people want them to spend the money on, which is good programming.

‘It does make it difficult for everybody to go on justifying this kind of funding if it’s just disappearing into managers’ pockets.’

The number of BBC staff earning the entry level pay grade fell by nearly 3,000 between June 1995 and this year. Those in the top pay grade increased by almost 100, from 328 to 426 over the same timespan.

An efficiency report published last week said the BBC has made savings of £1.1billion and would save a further £400million annually by 2016/17.

Miss Bulford said no more savings could be made through cuts to pay, staff and property and that ‘tough choices’ would have to be made over which services were sacrificed.

Through the licence fee, the BBC collected more than £3.762billion tax free last year, an increase of £70million from the previous 12 months.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Overall we have saved over £150million per year on pay and head count; reduced the number and pay bill of senior managers by more than a third; reduced talent pay by £35million since 2008; and we have cut the number of buildings in the UK and overseas – all helping to us save £1.1billion a year.’

The figures on the salary structure were obtained from the BBC website and through a freedom of information request.
