One of Britain’s most controversial and worst-performing rail firms has been granted a 23-month extension to its franchise by the Government.

Passengers have been promised improvements after the Government said First Great Western – dubbed ‘Worst Late Western’ by critics’ over poor punctuality and chronic overcrowding - will carry on running line until September 2015 before bidding starts for a new long-term franchise.

Critics said the extension was ‘a scandal’ and smacked of ‘rewards for failure on a massive scale.’

Controversial: The operator dubbed 'Worst Late Western' has been granted a franchise extension

The Great Western main line runs from London's Paddington station out to the Cotswolds, South Wales and south-west England.

But Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: ‘First Great Western are being rewarded for failure on a massive scale. They have increased walk-on fares by 210 per cent  since privatisation, three times faster than the rate of inflation.

‘They are also the first rail firm to provoke a strike by passengers in the entire history of the railways, in protest at overcrowding in the Bristol region.’

RMT transport union leader Bob Crow said: ‘This is another twist of the rail franchising racket with a company running one of the worst-performing services in the country given a free run to milk this vital inter-city line for all it is worth for another two years.

‘We are demanding to know 
just how much First extracted from the Government in last-ditch talks 
where they had bullied themselves into a monopoly provider position.

‘It
is a scandal that the publicly-run option was never considered for this
franchise even though it would have saved the taxpayer a fortune.’

But ministers and rail bosses insisted there would be improvements’ including greater wi-fi coverage and additional sleep carriages.

In August furious First Great Western passengers  vented their rage after enduring ‘third world cattle truck ’ conditions’  and a 12 hour nightmare journey  when an overcrowded and ageing train belonging to First Great Western  suffered brake-failure.

They accused the firm of ’incompetence’ after nearly 500 passengers were left stranded, thirsty and hungry  for almost six hours near Pewsey, Wiltshire, on the 30-year-old broken down train from Penzance to London Paddington.

Passengers described the fiasco as ‘horrific’ and a ‘chaotic disaster’ and said they were ‘treated like cattle’. Those  seeking to slake their thirst were outraged to be charged for hot drinks, said witnesses.

In July a damning new Government league-table of cattle-class services, identified a First Great Western service as officially the most overcrowded service in England and Wales.

It showed that in  Spring 2012,  the 07.44 First Great Western service  from Henley in Berkshire into Paddington in West London  carried 415 tightly-packed passengers in three carriages  designed to carry 225 people in Standard Class.

That meant there were 190 passengers ‘in excess of capacity’ and that the train was 84 per cent overcrowded. This was worse than the previous check in Spring 2011 when the same service was 80 per cent overcrowded.

Overall, First Great Western  also had the highest level of passengers ‘in excess of capacity’  of any London and south east England operator in 2012 at 7.1 per cent  across both peaks.

On track: Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the deal proved the new arrangement worked

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the franchise extention was further proof that the Government's new franchising schedule is on track: ‘The Great Western franchise provides a vital service for thousands of passengers every day and under this deal they will see real benefits.

‘This agreement will provide additional sleeper carriages between London and Cornwall securing the future of a key service once under threat.’

Mr McLoughlin added:  ‘We have also secured a commitment to deliver greater wi-fi coverage to improve the experience of long-distance journeys for passengers.

‘But I am also determined that we see further improvements during the lifetime of this contract; more standard class and fewer first class seats on key services and the delivery of more electric trains for the Thames Valley.’

First Great Western (FGW) is the rail-arm of transport giant First Group, whose  initially successful bid to run the West Coast Mainline was then overturned following a challenge by Sir Richard Branson.

First Group’s chief executive Tim O’Toole also heads the Government’s ‘Rail Delivery Group’ set up by ministers to IMPROVE services.

Mr O'Toole said: ‘Today's agreement is good news for FGW passengers, taxpayers and our shareholders as it provides continuity and consistency, building on the improvements our experienced team has already made over the last franchise period.

'We have seen significant improvements in customer satisfaction and punctuality, and working with the Department for Transport we have delivered additional capacity on the busiest morning peak trains.

‘We will work closely with stakeholders and partners along the route to explore further ways to support our local communities.’

Anthony Smith, chief executive of rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said: ‘We know that, for most passengers, the key thing is that trains keep running, turn up on time, and that they are able to get a seat.

’It is important that this short-term extension is used to prepare and deliver a better, more passenger-focused franchise where the passenger voice has been heard and taken into account.’
