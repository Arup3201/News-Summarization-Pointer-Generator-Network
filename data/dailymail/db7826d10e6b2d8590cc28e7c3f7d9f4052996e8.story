Actress Jennifer Aniston, pictured holding a glacéau smartwater, has fronted several ad campaigns for the bottled water in America

It was hailed as ‘pure’ when it was launched in Britain a decade ago and advertised as having been through a ‘highly sophisticated purification process’.

But Coca-Cola’s first attempt at bottled water turned out to be a disaster, after it was forced to recall all 500,000 Dasani bottles when it emerged it was in fact glorified tap water.

However, ten years on and the soft drinks giant is set to launch another assault on Britain’s £1.4billion bottled water market – this time with a healthy ‘smartwater’ which promises to be from a natural spring.

Coca-Cola GB, which also owns Fanta, Sprite and Dr Pepper, has revealed plans to launch its glacéau smartwater – which is one of its biggest products in America and favoured by celebrities including Jennifer Aniston – in the UK.

It is set to pump £3million into launching the product which this time will come from proper spring water.

Having learnt lessons from the first time around - when the drinks company was found to be making Dasani from purified tap water in Sidcup, south-east London - this time it is set to do things properly.

With its production plant in Morpeth, Northumberland – where it currently oversees the lesser-known Abbey Well brand – the drinks giant claims its smartwater will come via a process whereby it is vapour distilled before electrolytes are added for a ‘crisp, clean taste’.

Jon Woods, general manager of Coca-Cola GB & Ireland, said the premium product, which is set to hit shelves in August, would come ‘without the premium price’.

The recommended retail price for a 600ml bottle will be 57p - the same price charged by rivals for a 500ml bottle.

An 850ml bottle will be put on the market for 89p.

Mr Woods said: ‘Glacéau smartwater presents a great opportunity for us to grow our presence in the water category.

‘We have seen the success that the brand has delivered in the US market – and look forward to offering consumers a premium brand without the premium price.

‘We now have 22 brands in the UK 
including many low or no calorie options and provide people with a wide 
range of drinks to suit their lifestyle.’

The company withdrew all 500,000 Dasani bottles from sale in March 2004 after the water was found to be contaminated with illegal levels of Bromate - a chemical linked to cancer if consumed in high quantities

According to marketing industry 
sources, actress Jennifer Aniston could even be lined-up to help launch 
the product in Britain, having already been the face of it across the 
Atlantic.

Glacéau smartwater was first launched in the US in 1996.

The brand has grown strongly in the last seven years and is now the leading premium water brand in the US.

Coca-Cola, which has 106 water brands, already sells Glaceau vitaminwater - a range of fruit-flavoured drinks - in the UK.

In 
2004, Coca-Cola ran into trouble after it began selling the premium 
bottled water Dasani, which turned out to be filtered tap water from 
Sidcup in south-east London.

The
 company decided to withdraw all 500,000 Dasani bottles from sale after 
the water was found to be contaminated with illegal levels of a chemical
 linked to cancer.

It came weeks after it emerged the source for Dasani was the mains supply to Coca-Cola's factory in Sidcup.

The company said a ‘highly sophisticated purification process’ meant the product was ‘as pure as bottled water gets’

But
 it was found to have levels of bromate - a chemical considered harmful 
if consumed in large quantities - which exceeded UK legal standards.
