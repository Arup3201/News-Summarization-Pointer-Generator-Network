A disabled pensioner who lost more than £700,000 in a telesales scam has won most of his money back.

David Parker, 77, was ‘cajoled, bullied and, on occasions lied to’ in order to get him to part with his retirement savings as part of a 'land banking' scheme.

Cold-callers convinced him to invest huge amounts of money buying up land in the scheme, in the hope it would be later be sold to developers at a huge premium.

Ruling: David Parker, 77, was given more than £600,000 compensation at the High Court, part of the Royal Courts of Justice, pictured

But the land - small plots in Buckinghamshire, King's Lynn in Norfolk and Slough in Berkshire - had 'zero' chance of being given planning permission, and turned out to be practically worthless.

Mr Parker, who is hard of hearing, suffers from cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, spent a total of £705,895 on the scheme, including £100,000 in 'facilitation fees' between June 2009 and February 2011, a High Court judge said.

And even though the company running the scheme - part of umbrella group The Property Partnership - liquidated with debts of more than £5million, Mr Parker was still granted compensation from a solicitor whom the court ruled was in on the scheme.

Saying that the solicitor - who had earned hefty fees from legal work for The Property Partnership (TPP) - was 'party to a common design' in the scheme, the judge ordered him to pay Mr Parker damages of £606,000.

The solicitor, who has not been named for legal reasons, had been disciplined twice by the Law Society before for mishandling clients' funds and was fined a total of £25,000, the court heard.

The judge said there was no evidence that the solicitor, who carried out conveyancing work for TPP, had told any lies himself or had any knowledge that telesales staff were ‘peddling’ misleading information to Mr Parker.

Even though he was not acting for Mr Parker personally, nor did he owe him a legal duty of care, the judge pointed out that he was earning money from the scheme, and could easily have pointed out that there was 'zero' chance of the investment coming good.

The judge said: “But there is no evidence that he did any of these things. Why is that?

'It seems to me that there can really only be one answer: like TPP, he was eager to ensure the success of each scheme because he would be likely to benefit substantially from such success.

'It was certainly not in his financial interests that anything should be done which might have the effect of dissuading purchasers from investing in the schemes, quite the reverse'.

Rejecting claims that Mr Parker had himself been negligent in investing in the scheme, the judge said TPP had ‘expressly discouraged’ him from obtaining independent legal advice - saying that it offered a ‘free legal service’.

The solicitor was ordered to pay Mr Parker back the money he had lost, less the £99,895 facilitation fees for which he could not be held responsible.
