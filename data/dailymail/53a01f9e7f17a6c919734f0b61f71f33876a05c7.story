Stella McCartney has been criticised for comments she made about her latest collection after she said that strong women ‘are not terribly attractive’.

The fashion designer was speaking at Paris Fashion Week yesterday where she explained her newest outfits welcomed the ‘fragility’ of women and allowed them to have more ‘softness’.

But her remarks have sparked controversy from feminist campaigner’s and groups including one who described the comments as ‘weird’.

McCartney was backstage after showcasing her spring/summer 2015 collection when she said: ‘Strength on its own in a woman is quite aggressive and not terribly attractive all the time.

‘This collection is really celebrating the gentle side.’

Vagenda Magazine posted on Twitter: ‘[It’s a] very weird statement. I imagine the women who can afford to buy her clothes didn’t get there being timid.’

While writer Sasha Wilkins, creator of lifestyle blog LibertyLondonGirl, tweeted: ‘Guess you can get away with pretending to be a fragile butterfly in business when you have a MASSIVE fiscal family cushion and ALL the power’.

Ellie Levenson, the author of The Noughtie Girl’s Guide to Feminism, told The Times the designer’s explanation about making women appear more vulnerable is taking a backwards step.

She said: ‘It is particularly galling when a woman who has benefited from feminism and being strong then tries to pull the carpet from other women.’

The spring/summer 2015 collection promised clothes with ‘effortless movement and a fluid silhouette’

TV historian and feminist Mary Beard, a professor of classics at the University of Cambridge, told the paper McCartney, who is said to be worth £46million, could have been trying to say something more complicated about the nature of strength.

‘Possibly that brute force doesn’t equal strength. In which case I agree, but then I’m not a designer,’ she said.

McCartney’s collection was taken down the catwalk at the Palais Garnier opera house, which seats 2,000, in the centre of Paris.

Cara Delevingne was among the models on the runway and wore a black cape decorated with grey flowers.

The show promised to deliver clothes with ‘effortless movement and a fluid silhouette’ and was watched by several high powered women, including Anna Wintour – the editor of American Vogue.

The image of the model wearing a new t-shirt from the collection was posted on Instagram this morning

Stella McCartney’s latest collection has caused yet more controversy on social media after she posted this picture on Instagram this morning.

The model wears the ‘Summer 2015 Show’ t-shirt, which is available to buy for £70, and was uploaded with the comment ‘worn well’.

But users on the photo-sharing network have criticised the health of the model with some saying she looks ‘terribly thin’ and ‘sick’.

Greylady62 commented on the post: ‘Appalling image....this young lady is clearly very ill & the body image being used is all that is wrong with the fashion world’.

While maggiemoo210 said: ‘I am very sad to learn you support this way of life given you are a role model to girls and women everywhere.’

Several users said they would be unfollowing Stella McCartney’s Instagram account after seeing the image today.
