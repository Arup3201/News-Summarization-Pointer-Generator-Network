The sun shone on travellers of every generation on the second day of Appleby Horse Fair in Cumbria today.

Gypsies from around Europe descended on the Eden Valley for the annual event, where traditionally travellers parade their horses before potential buyers, racing them at high speed along the 'mad mile' before cooling them down with a dip in the River Eden.

The fair, which runs until next Wednesday, is the largest and one of the oldest of its kind anywhere in Europe, attracting 10,000 gipsies and 30,000 visitors each year.

Camp: While many arrive at the Cumbrian beauty spot in traditional horse-drawn caravans, other travellers arrive in more modern motorhomes, vans, and cars

The historic fair, which became even more popular after featuring in the Channel 4 show, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, has been running since 1685, when King James II granted a Royal Charter allowing a horse fair to be held 'near the River Eden'.

Gipsies come from around the world to meet friends, conduct business, and trade horses, while visitors come to admire the animals and visit the market stalls, palm readers, and fortune tellers.

There was controversy earlier this week when some travellers set up camp on a private golf course at Appleby but organisers said they had worked to minimise antisocial behaviour-related problems.

Robin Hooper, Eden District Council’s chief executive, said: 'A great deal of preparation has gone into the planning of this year’s fair to help people enjoy the event safely.

'This work includes pubs and off-licences signing up to a voluntary charter and having the street cleansing operation in place throughout the fair, so that the impact of this event on the local community is minimised as much as possible.'

He added: ‘There have been some issues at the start of the week, with some displacement of caravans in unforeseen circumstances.'

Last year’s
 event prompted a number of complaints after rubbish was left strewn 
across the town. There were also 20 people arrested on their way to the 
event on suspicion of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.

In 1965 Westmorland Borough Council attempted to shut down the event but were forced to back down after a huge outcry.
