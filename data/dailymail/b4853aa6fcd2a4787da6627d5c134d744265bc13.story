A group of farmers have come up with an ingenious way of recycling the thousands of external fuel tanks jettisoned by U.S planes during the Vietnam War - by turning them into river boats and canoes.

The huge chunks of aluminum were discarded by U.S. planes during the late 1960s and early 1970s and remain scattered throughout the forests of southern Vietnam to this day.

But rather than leaving the abandoned fuel tanks to go unused, local farmers have started cleaning and customising the hollow tubes, with dozens of them now in use as river boats and canoes throughout the region.

Ingenious: A group of farmers in southern Vietnam have started using thousands of fuel tanks cast off by U.S fighter jets and bombers during the Vietnam War as river boats and canoes. The tanks were jettisoned in the area during the late 1960s and early 1970s

War: The huge chunks of aluminum were discarded by U.S. planes during the late 1960s and early 1970s and remain scattered throughout the forests of southern Vietnam to this day

History: The fuel tanks arrived in Vietnam in less than peaceful circumstances, attached to the bottom of U.S. fighter jets (top and bottom) and bombers which used them as a backup to internal fuel supplies while on long flights over the forested areas

The fuel tanks arrived in Vietnam in far less peaceful circumstances, attached to the bottom of U.S. fighter jets and bombers which used them as a backup to internal fuel supplies while on long flights over the forested areas.

Although they were key to increasing endurance and even allowed the planes to be refueled while flying, the auxiliary fuel tanks also slowed the planes down and limited maneuverability, so could easily be cast off if they needed to accelerate quickly to attack or escape the enemy.

Now the fuel tanks are experiencing a second life as key modes of transport among the remote and heavily forested areas of south Vietnam.

Getting around: With limited roads connecting small villages, the area be difficult to negotiate on land in many places, so the many rivers that cut through the forests are often the best way to move vital supplies and transport people

Idea: Farmers were among the first to spot an alternative use for the large pieces of aluminum scattered throughout the local forests - not least because they naturally float thanks to their hollow bodies, lightweight frames and aerodynamic designs

With limited roads connecting small villages, the area be difficult to negotiate on land in many places, so the many rivers that cut through the forests are often the best way to move vital supplies and transport people.

Although they have been used for centuries, the traditional wooden river boats that are built and used in the area have a fairly limited lifespan and are in need of regular maintenance and repair.

It's not surprising then that farmers were among the first to spot an alternative use for the large pieces of aluminum scattered throughout the local forests - not least because they naturally float thanks to their hollow bodies, lightweight frames and aerodynamic designs.

With just a small amount of customisation - including cutting large holes in the top to make them easier to board and load - the abandoned fuel tanks are now considered a simple and free way for the poor farmers in remote areas to ensure they are able to buy and sell their products in nearby villages.
