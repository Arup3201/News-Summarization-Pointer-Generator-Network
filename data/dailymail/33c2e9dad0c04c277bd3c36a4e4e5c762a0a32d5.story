It may not be quite as sophisticated as the rumoured iWatch, but a new Â£30 bracelet aims to tell you when your wife is calling, or when your favourite celebrity has tweeted.

The Embrace+ connects via Bluetooth to an iPhone or Android handset, and can be programmed to flash with different colours when a particular person emails, tweets or sends a Facebook message.

Its inventors claim it is perfect for those who can't bear to put their phone in their pocket.

The bracelet, called Embrace+ is set to to on sale later this year - and owners can assign friends colours so they always know who is calling or emailing - even if their phone is in their pocket

The bracelet uses Bluetooth to communicate with a mobile phone, and is set up using a special app.

Its makers claims almost any colour can be displayed from the 'colour wheel' in the accompanying app.

'Embrace+ is for those who have a busy lifestyle, and want to stay connected with their smartphones,' the firm says.

'The project is the result of an idea that we came up with during a night out over a couple of drinks last summer.

'While laughing about ourselves checking our phones all the time to see whether we had received a message on one of the popular social media apps we decided to come up with a solution.

The bracelet can display almost any colour, with each being assigned to a person or action via a special app for Android and iOS devices

'Right away we agreed we don't want to wear a 'device' and it should easily blend in with any fashion style.'

The bracelet will last for 10 days on a single charge, and is expected to show around 100 alerts a day to the average user.

The design, available in three shapes, is based on a gemstone.

'A precious gemstone is beautiful, durable, and rare.

'They often shine bright and flash a number of colors and this play of colors makes them so special.

'Our designs are a tribute to these precious gemstones.
