Officials are concerned about the possible spread of rabies through the booming trade of puppies illegally smuggled into Britain from Eastern Europe. 

Thousands of dogs are being transported to the UK in squalid conditions and are often missing crucial vaccinations, before being sold to unsuspecting families for huge profit. 

A charity investigation has revealed how both corruption and ‘shocking’ animal welfare run through the heart of the puppy trade.

Young puppies too young to be transported are being illegally imported from eastern European puppy farms

Dogs Trust said huge numbers of newborn puppies – below the legal age for transportation – are being smuggled in from eastern Europe due to a lack of border checks, and warned Britons to be cautious if they buy a pet from abroad this Christmas.

After being brought to the UK in appalling and cramped conditions, the dogs are sold on to well-meaning families, who believe they have been legally imported and undergone rigorous health checks. 

Investigators said that four out of five vets they approached in Lithuania admitted to falsifying pet passports or vaccination records, or said they would be willing to. 

Meanwhile, nine of the 11 breeders and dealers they tracked down in the country said they would sell underage puppies to the UK, or already had done. Dogs often travel more than a thousand miles, and many are unvaccinated – meaning they risk spreading diseases such as rabies to other family pets. 

Pet dealers admitted to Dogs Trust investigators on camera that they can make up to £100,000 a year. 

Families who buy illegally imported dogs could be hit with large vet fees and quarantine costs

Popular breeds such as French bulldogs and pugs are regularly advertised for sale online from around £750 each.

The dealer will pay roughly £200 to buy each dog and arrange its transport to Britain, meaning they can make £550 per sale.

The growth in dog trading was triggered by a relaxation of the pet passport rules in 2012, allowing owners to travel with their animals without a lengthy quarantine period. But UK border control insiders told the Mail that the scheme is being widely abused to import huge shipments of dogs.

The number of declared puppies entering Britain from Lithuania increased by 780 per cent between 2011 and 2013, while from Hungary the figure rose 663 per cent.

And this does not include the thousands of puppies thought to go undeclared at the borders.

Four out of five vets in Lithuania admitted falsifying vaccination records for dogs awaiting export

Paula Boyden, veterinary director at Dogs Trust, warned last night that the trade will only increase in the run-up to Christmas as dogs are bought as gifts. ‘The risk of unknowingly bringing a puppy from eastern Europe with diseases and behavioural problems into the home is very real,’ she said.

‘Buyers must be vigilant, as a puppy brought in from eastern Europe could cost far more than expected.’ If the authorities identify a pet as having been imported illegally, it is the new owners – not the dealers – who are forced to pay vet fees and quarantine costs.

Dogs Trust said this has led to puppies being abandoned when families cannot afford the bills. 

The Dogs Trust said some families will abandon their dogs when faced with unforeseen vet bills 

A Defra spokesperson said:

'Responsibility for stopping the illegal movement of puppies begins in the country where they are born, and we are writing to the authorities in Lithuania and Hungary to remind them of their duty to ensure passports are correct and the welfare of pets intended for sale is safeguarded. 

'Every pet travelling with its owner on an approved route is checked for compliance with the pet travel regime and the Border Force carry out a wide range of checks on animals arriving in the UK. Stringent penalties are already in place for those that breach the law by smuggling animals or using false documentation.

'Changes to the pet passport scheme this December will further strengthen the system across the EU by increasing traceability and making the pet passport harder to forge or tamper with. People in the UK can also help end this trade by insisting to see a puppy with its mum, which is the best way to ensure the dog's welfare.'

Re rabies…

'The risk to the UK from rabies is very low and changes to pet travel scheme will make risk even lower. Significantly, there hasn’t been a single case of rabies in the EU linked to pet movements since the pet travel scheme started in 2004.'
