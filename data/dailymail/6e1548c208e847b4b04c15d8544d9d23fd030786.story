They always loved playing by the frog pond.

But when their father told his two young daughters about the story of Prince Charming, their fascination knew no bounds.

Ever since then, two-year-old Kazmirah Reynolds and her sister Nevaeh, four, had one desire in mind - to live out their own version of the fairy tale by kissing one of the inhabiting amphibians.

Enchanted: The girls became fascinated by the pond near their home in LaFollate, Tennessee, after their father told them kissing one of the frogs might transform it into a prince

It was, however, a quest that so nearly ended in tragedy.

In Kazmirah's ever-determined bid to find 'froggy', she jumped into the pond one day and went completely under.

But help was immediately to hand as Nevaeh grabbed a nearby stick and used it to pull her younger sister to safety.

Their mother, Nikole, was making lunch at home when she heard screams. Panicked, she dashed outside to find the girls soaking wet, but otherwise fine.

Pond panic: Nevaeh became submerged after jumping into the water to get closer to the amphibians, but luckily her sister was there to grab a stick and pull her out

Relief: Their mother, Nikole, heard screams as she was making lunch in the house, but found the girls safe and well by the time she dashed outside. She says she owes Kazmirah's life to Nevaeh

Nevaeh told MyVLT News: 'We were going to look for froggy, so my sissy jumped in the water.

'I grabbed the stick and pulled her out - one that don't break, so sissy don't fall down.'

With her arms wide open, she added: 'I love my sister THIS much.'

Nikole said the girls were enchanted by 
the pond ever since their father said that kissing one of the frogs may 
turn it into Prince Charming.

In search of their fairy tale: The sisters were driving their Barbie car outside the family home when they decided to hop over the fence to reach the pond

They were riding in their Barbie car outside the family home in LaFollate, Tennessee, parked it by a fence and hopped over it to get to the pond.

But they won't be allowed to continue their search for quite some time.

'If it wasn't for Nevaeh, I would have lost a daughter,' said a relieved Nikole.
