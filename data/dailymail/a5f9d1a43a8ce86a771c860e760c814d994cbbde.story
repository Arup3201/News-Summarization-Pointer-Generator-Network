Former prison nurse Karen Cosford has been barred from practising after she had an affair with inmate serving a life sentence

A former prison nurse who had an affair with a convicted rapist at a top security jail has been ordered to be struck off the nursing register.

Married Karen Cosford had a relationship lasting several months with Brian McBride, who was serving a life sentence at Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire.

She denied any wrongdoing at a trial in 2012 but was found guilty of misconduct by engaging in a sexual relationship with an inmate and was jailed for three years.

Cosford, 49, of Normanton, Wakefield, was also found guilty of failing to tell prison authorities that McBride had a mobile phone and bringing in top-ups for the prisoner.

Today she was barred from practising as a nurse by medical body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), following her release from prison last November.

At her trial, Cosford, who worked in the jail's medical centre, claimed McBride, who is serving life for multiple offences of rape and violence, raped her then intimidated her so she would not report it.

But jurors at Leeds Crown Court rejected the claim after hearing how she became inappropriately close to McBride, after he duped her into thinking he had wealth on the outside, and started a sexual relationship.

The pair had met as he had a job as a cleaner in the healthcare centre, the court heard.

During the trial, the court heard how other officers had stood guard while she went to McBride's cell for sex. She had also written him a love letter, which was found in a bag of sugar.

Cosford was jailed over the fling, during which she turned a blind eye to rapist Brian McBride's mobile phone use, but was released last year

An NMC fitness to practise panel in London has now heard that Cosford sent an email last month in which she stated that she felt 'it would be a fruitless exercise to continue fighting to clear my name with the NMC. I hope this will allow you to progress without any further disruption.'

And in a letter dated August 23 last year she accepted she had been convicted of the charges and was serving a custodial sentence.

Panel chairman Julian Weinberg said it considered she had demonstrated behaviour falling seriously short of the conduct and standards expected of a registered nurse, and that her conduct was a gross breach of trust.

The affair happened at High Security Wakefield Prison which houses child killer Mick Philpott and April Jones' murderer, Mark Bridger

Mr Weinberg said: 'There is an expectation for nurses to obey the law and any disregard for the law, particularly in the setting of a maximum security prison, poses a risk to public safety.

'Bearing in mind the need to uphold proper standards and to maintain public confidence in the profession and the NMC as regulator, the panel was satisfied that Mrs Cosford's fitness to practise is currently impaired by reason of her convictions.'

The panel concluded that Cosford's conduct and convictions were fundamentally incompatible with her continuing to be a registered nurse.

'The only proportionate and appropriate sanction, sufficient to protect the public and maintain confidence in the profession, is a striking-off order,' Mr Weinberg said.
