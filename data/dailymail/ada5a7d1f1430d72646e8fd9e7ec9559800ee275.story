Claims Apple is about to release headphones that can monitor a person's pulse have been revealed as a hoax.

The source, who referred to himself as DMx, says it was part of a plan to to the anonymous social network 'for comedy'.

A series of posts claimed Apple was preparing to unveil a new set of headphones that can monitor a wearer's heart rate and blood pressure.

Apple's headphones could monitor the pulse of runners, and automatically track their health and performance.

According to Apple's patents, the fitness monitoring system is built in a set of headphones, something users commonly wear to listen to music during workouts.

By positioning the headset in or near the ear, the embedded activity sensor can pick up temperature, perspiration and heart rate data, among other metrics. In addition to skin-based readings, an accelerometer may also be incorporated into the earbud chassis to facilitate the collection of accurate movement data.

However, the firm has not revealed how i will capture a user's heartrate.

The earbuds are also expected to contain a tiny tracking device so they can tell the user where they are if lost.

According to the anonymous poster, the headphones could even automatically alert your doctor if it detects a dangerously high reading.

'The phone stores the data in a similar way to thumbprint point data, fully encrypted and nothing identifiable.

'But nice to send to your doctor to keep track of at which point your blood pressure started rising for example.'

The poster claimed to be a recent employee of the company who was recently fired.

'I have being manipulated… I'm not the only person who got sent home for good last week, he said.

However, today the user revealed he had made the whole thing up.

'I made it up.

'I wrote it 5 minutes after I woke up on the 1st of may.

'I was blurry eyed, I had a headache, I was using the toilet and worrying about my blood pressure,' wrote DMx.

'The worst part is that the story just came out of Apple hiring an expert in making products that are exactly like I described.

'I’d never seen the patents that Apple filed about the Earbuds. I just made it all up.'

The rumour of the new earbuds first surfaced on Secret, an anonymous gossip app popular in Silicon Valley

'I’d been messing around with secret as an outlet for comedy.

'The anonymous nature makes it a fun place to post things you can’t on twitter.'

Secret has been the platform for several accurate tech leaks in the past few weeks, including the fact Nike planned to close down its Fuelband wearables department, and that Google + chief Vic Gundotra was set to quit the search giant.

MacRumors had previously revealed Apple already has patents that show the company has an interest in this type of technology.

'In one embodiment, the present invention can include headsets having one or more integrated physiological sensors,' a patent filed by Apple in 2007 says.

'The headsets can be, for example, headphones for receiving audio signals from a media device or headsets for communication with cellular telephones.'

Another patent points to using earbuds to collect biometric data, including perspiration levels, and a user’s heart rate and temperature.

That patent shows an EarPod device with an arm and what appears to be a sensor at the end of it.

MacRumors revealed Apple already has patents that show the company has an interest in this type of technology.

The app will work with a new app Apple is believed to be preparing to show off in June.

Called Healthbook, the new app is expected to be unveiled at Apple's annual developer conference.

It offers everything from food and sleep tracking to blood sugar level analysis - and can even tell how much water you've drunk.

At tonight's event, Cook is set to unveil the next-generation of mobile software, dubbed iOS 8.  Although many of the changes are likely to incremental, the biggest addition is rumoured to be an application called Healthbook, which is believed to have leaked last month (pictured) and is designed to track and monitor fitness
