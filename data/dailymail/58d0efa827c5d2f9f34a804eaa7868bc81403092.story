Samit Patel was delighted to be the crowd-pleaser at Trent Bridge where 11,000 saw his all-round contribution help Nottinghamshire begin their NatWest t20 Blast campaign with victory over Lancashire.

On an opening night which brought close finishes elsewhere - notably Sussex's Yasir Arafat-inspired win over Surrey at Hove - the Patel-powered Outlaws ruled Nottingham.

Patel hit 56 out of 182 for five; then he added two for 25 with his left-arm spin as Steven Mullaney took three for 46 against his old club in the Lancastrians' 149 all out - despite Jordan Clark's defiant 44 from only 20 balls in the North Division clash.

Back with a bang: A crowd of 11,000 was at Trent Bridge to see Nottinghamshire's opening match of the 2014 campaign

Patel insisted afterwards that the home crowd played a significant part too.

'They
 were absolutely brilliant tonight - and if we can put a show on every 
game like that then I hope they will keep coming through the door,' he 
told www.trentbridge.co.uk.

'It's
 a huge difference when you play in front of a crowd like that. Lads 
like myself, (Alex) Hales, (Michael) Lumb and (James) Taylor thrive off 
it - and it makes us play better.'

There
 were only half as many in the stands at Headingley, where Ben Duckett 
held his nerve to ensure Northamptonshire launched the defence of their 
title with a thrilling three-wicket win over Yorkshire.

Steelbacks
 highlights of four for 25 on debut from New Zealand seamer Ian Butler, a
 brutal 43 at the top of the order from David Willey - hero of last 
summer's Edgbaston final against Surrey - and then finally Duckett 
outdid Yorkshire's hard-working collective.

Breakthrough: Jack Brooks of Yorkshire is congratulated after running out Kyle Coetzer

Liam
 Plunkett and Tim Bresnan's 54-run stand, from a very wobbly 87 for six,
 made a match of it by rescuing 162 for seven for Yorkshire.

It
 was ultimately insufficient but confirmed only off the penultimate 
ball, when Graeme White struck the only delivery he faced past point for
 four off Ryan Sidebottom to get Northants home - with Duckett unbeaten 
on a career-best 39.

Durham were also winners thanks to an unbeaten 80 from Scotland batsman Calum MacLeod on debut for his new county.

He
 hit seven fours and two sixes from 56 balls, veteran Paul Collingwood 
adding 62 in a fourth-wicket stand of 113, as Durham posted 173 for four
 despite a sticky start at home to Worcestershire.

Debutant
 opener Richard Oliver made 43 in the run chase, but the visitors were 
all out for 144 - Collingwood completing a fine all-round performance 
with three for 29.

Still got it: Paul Collingwood hits a four for Durham on his way to a score of 62 in their 29-run victory over Worcestershire

Dream debut: Callum McLeod made 80 not out in his first appearance for Durham

Leicestershire
 began with a 27-run win at home to Derbyshire, despite veteran 
Australian batsman Marcus North's 90 from only 47 balls.

North
 hit six sixes and six fours but found precious little support, in 
pursuit of a total of 197 for four in which evergreen New Zealander 
Scott Styris (63no) top-scored.

Nathan Buck took three for 26 for Leicestershire.

Runs: Leicestershire's Josh Cobb hits out during his side's 27-run win over Derbyshire at Grace Road

Chase: Wes Durston strikes the ball some distance as Derbyshire tried in vain to chase down the 198 required for victory

The
 match of the night in the South Division came between Sussex and Surrey
 at Hove, where the hosts beat last year's finalists off the final ball 
after Arafat hit successive fours at the end of Jade Dernbach's over 
against one of his old clubs.

Jason
 Roy (57) and Gary Wilson (50) both made half-centuries in Surrey's 171 
for seven - slow left-armer Ashar Zaidi taking three for 32.

Then
 Luke Wright brought his fine championship form into the sprint format, 
with 56 from just 31 balls - before Ben Brown and Arafat's late surge 
did the trick.

Slip up: England's Jad Dernbach failed to defend 15 off the last over as Surrey started with a defeat

Somerset's 
Australian left-armer Dirk Nannes (four for 21) won the battle of the 
seamers with Gloucestershire's James Fuller (four for 32) as the 
visitors edged the west-country derby at Bristol.

Half-centuries
 from Craig Kieswetter (55) and Alviro Petersen (51) took Somerset to 
156 for eight, and then Hamish Marshall (54) could not lift 
Gloucestershire above 138 all out.

Leg-spinner Max Waller also picked up three for 22 for Somerset.

At Southampton, Glamorgan mustered 161 for seven against Hampshire - for whom left-arm spinner Danny Briggs took three for 26.

It proved 10 runs too many for the hosts, seamer Will Owen finishing with three for 32.
