Suspect: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, (pictured) is one of the extra 400,00 names which have been added to a U.S. database of suspected terrorists

The number of names on a highly classified U.S. central database used to track suspected terrorists has increased from 540,000 to 875,000 in just five years, it has been revealed.

The increase in names is believed to be due to security agencies using the system more 
in the wake of the failed 2009 attack on a plane by "underpants bomber" 
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in Detroit.

Intelligence and law enforcement officials later acknowledged in Congress they had missed clues to that attack 
despite Abdulmutallab's name appearing in the central database.

Known as the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), the database provides information on people whom 
U.S. authorities see as known, suspected or potential terrorists from 
around the world.

The list, which is maintained by the National 
Counterterrorism Center in Virginia, is used by security agencies use to build up information about possible terrorists, like the 'no-fly' list which prevents 
people who feature on it from boarding airplanes.

People on the list include alleged Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whose name was added in 2011 after the U.S. spy agency received a 
request from Russian authorities to investigate him for suspected 
radical Islamist activities.

The CIA also entered the name of Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva's, into the TIDE database.

The official familiar with the latest statistics said that even though the number of TIDE entries has grown substantially, the data is still manageable as intelligence agencies have improved their system of extract information from large amunts of data.

However, Karen Greenberg, an expert in counter-terrorism policy at Fordham University, questioned whether the growth in the database's size made it easier for officials to spot threats before they materialize.

She said: 'What you want is more focus, not less focus. It can't be just about quantity. It has to be about specificity.'

The vast size of TIDE came into the spotlight in the wake of the bombing late last month of the Boston Marathon.

U.S. officials now acknowledge that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's name was entered into TIDE by the CIA in the autumn of 2011,

Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with authorities in the days following the Boston bombing and his younger brother Dzhokhar was captured by police.
