David Luiz says he will not celebrate if he scores against Chelsea in the Champions League.

Brazilian centre-back Luiz scored an own goal in this fixture last year, when he was in Jose Mourinho’s back-four.

On Tuesday he will line up against his former club for Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of this last-16 clash.

Luiz said: 'Last year I scored my first goal for PSG and I want to do my best for the team and the club. I’m happy to be here. Maybe if I score against Chelsea, I don’t celebrate out of respect but of course, I’ll be happy.' 

Despite his departure for £50million in the summer, Luiz said he felt Chelsea are a stronger prospect this year than they were last season under Jose Mourinho.

'They are stronger this year,' he said. 'They understand more the philosophy of Jose Mourinho and in his second year it is easier to pass the message. And they have players joining with amazing quality like Diego (Costa) and (Cesc) Fabregas.'

Comparing his new manager Laurent Blanc with former boss Mourinho, Luiz said: 'To compare them, they are both ugly, just that,' before smiling as he looked over to Blanc alongside him. 

'I hope this is the year we win it (the Champions League),' he added. 'We have an amazing team but it is not easy to win the Champions League.

'We need to be strong, play an amazing first leg because it will be decided there. Not many players have opportunities to play these games. Everyone’s excited to play. Tomorrow can be a great moment for us.

'It doesn’t matter where you are in this kind of game, you need to be focused, mentally and physically, everything. It will be a difficult game. I want to qualify, like I did last year but now I want to qualify for PSG.

And Luiz thinks the tie will be played on a level field, despite PSG's struggles in Ligue 1 this season. 

'These games are decided in small details,' he said. 'Chelsea have two European titles. The project for PSG is to be the best club in the world in the next few years and try to improve every day. In the game, you have two amazing teams, good players, amazing coaches.'

PSG coach Blanc confirmed that PSG will be without Yohan Cabaye, Lucas Moura and Serge Aurier  through injury, with Marquinhos, Thiago Motta and Blaise Matuidi doubtful.

'We’ll see if the others are fit,' Blanc said.

'We have training at 4pm. It’s not the best way to prepare but we will know more after training.'
