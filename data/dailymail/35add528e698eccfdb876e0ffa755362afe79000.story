Patty Ramirez just wanted to a video of her granddaughter, Sadie, having a fun day at the zoo but her home movie went viral when she captured the three-year-old girl being booted by a pony. 

And while Ramirez says Sadie, 3, has recovered she's still upset with the attendants at the Niabi Zoo in Coal Valley, Ill., who she says weren't being watchful.

Sadie had finished riding a pony named Cricket and went to pet the animal goodbye when she was given a kick and sent tumbling through the dirt.

Sadie, 3, was having a great day riding a pony named Cricket on a visit to the Niabi Zoo

After going to pet Cricket goodbye, the horse gave her a swift kick sending her flying back behind a second pony in the stable

'You don’t set a two- and a three-year-old down and just walk away 
when there’s a big animal standing next to them,' Patty told WQAD. 'They have to have more responsibility, they have 
to have better training.'

Mark Heinzman, who directs the Niabi Zoo, said that while he regrets the incident accidents can happen.

Animals, no matter how well trained and cared for, can still be unpredictable, he said.

'As with any animal, there's some inherent risk you have to pay attention to,' he said. 'Just because they are animals.'

Grandmother Patty Ramirez says the zoo staff should be trained better to keep children safe from the animals

He
 added that there were signs posted at the pony ride asking families to 
remember that they are responsible for their child's safety.

Ramirez said she hoped the incident would lead to better training for attendants.

As for Sadie she's recovering well and still wants to ride the ponies.

Just not Cricket.
