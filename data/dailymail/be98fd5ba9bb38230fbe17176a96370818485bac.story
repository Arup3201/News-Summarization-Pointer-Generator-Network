Eighties TV star Lysette Anthony has admitted how she was left homeless and on benefits after a succession of 'expensive husbands'

She may have been known as the face of the eighties, raking in thousands for a day’s work in front of the camera.

But yesterday television star Lysette Anthony revealed that she has been left penniless, homeless and at times hungry – after a series of ‘expensive husbands’.

Miss Anthony is best known for starring in shows such as Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and in Three Up, Two Down, on which she made £2,500 a week.

The actress, who says she earned only £6,000 this year, has explained that expensive legal battles with her former partners led to the demise of her fortune.

She also criticised the drop in fees paid to TV actors over the last two decades, saying: ‘In those days you could earn a living, but it’s got to the stage where we actors can’t go on like this.’

Called the ‘face of the eighties’ by photographer David Bailey, Miss Anthony was also well known for her modelling – commanding tens of thousands of pounds for a single shoot.

However the 51-year-old went through a series of rocky relationships, with her first marriage to actor Luc Leestemaker ending in 1995 after five years. 

She walked down the aisle for a second time with director David Price, but they split two years later.

Miss Anthony said: ‘Over the years I have had quite a lot of expensive husbands. I have been homeless and on welfare for a while. That was during what I called “the troubles”.’

She added: ‘Everyone’s behaving now and that’s fine, but there have been times when I got incredibly thin because I couldn’t really afford to eat.’

The actress also went through a highly publicised break-up from BAFTA-nominated composer Simon Boswell, the father of her son Jimi.

Speaking about their relationship breakdown, Miss Anthony criticised the legal system’s treatment of non-married couples.

She told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘The law in this country is a disgrace if you’re not married. We bought a house together, but all that you are owed in terms of your input, your finances, is your investment in the property, in the bricks and mortar.

‘So the fact that you bought heaven knows how many Christmas presents and paid for and contributed, that’s irrelevant, and also every single gift that you’ve ever been given is no longer yours. It’s simply because you’re not married, and it’s absolutely wrong.’

She added: ‘But to be fair to Simon, he did do the honourable thing and made up the difference and has put it in trust for Jimi.’
