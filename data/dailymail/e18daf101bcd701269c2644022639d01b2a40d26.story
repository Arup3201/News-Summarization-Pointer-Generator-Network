Parents may worry that their children aren’t getting enough quality sleep.

But now there’s a smart bed  that alerts parents when their child is asleep - as well as if they are venturing out of  bed -  to provide adults with sleep data via a smart app.

The SleepIQ bed by Sleep Number in Minneapolis can also be adjusted to make it more comfortable if a child is tossing and turning.

The SleepIQ bed (pictured) has built in sensors to alert parents when their child is asleep and out of their bed, providing them with sleep data via a smart app. It automatically adjusts to make the bed more comfortable if a child is tossing and turning

The bed made its debut at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and claims to be the only one in the world that adjusts with children as they grow. 

Children don’t need to wear a smartband or alternative wearable gadget in bed. 

Instead, the quality of their sleep is measured by sensors integrated in the bed, which monitor their presence, average breathing rate, heart rate and movement. It uses a full-body algorithm to assess quality of sleep.

They are given a SleepIQ score for each night’s sleep, which parents can see using an accompanying app. 

An accompanying app has features for parents and children. It shpws their sleep data (pictured centre), including a nightly score called a SleepIQ to document the quality of a night's sleep (left) as well as check-lists for children when they wake up (right)

The Bed comes with built-in sensors to measure a child’s average breathing rate and heart rate as well as their presence and movement, by using a full-body algorithm to assess quality of sleep.

Data is shown in the accompanying ‘sleep dashboard’ app, which shows how well a child slept.

Parents can also receive alerts via the app if their child has got out of bed, or is moving around a lot, perhaps indicating they are having a nightmare.

The firmness of the bed can be adjusted to support children as they grow.

The mattress can be tilted up for reading.

Fun features such as a monster-detecting app and a light to guide children if they have to get up during the night are included.

It also allows parents to monitor routines that affect sleep, such as exercise, caffeine and screen time, helping them to develop a routine that promotes a good night’s shut-eye.

The bed sends an alert to the app when it detects a child is out of bed or is restless, such as if they are having a nightmare.

Its firmness can be adjusted to change the level of comfort and support to suit children as they grow.

A ‘head tilt’ feature for reading is built in and parents can remotely turn a light our after reading time using the app.

There are also fun features such as a ‘monster scanner’ which uses a mobile phone to check for and fight monsters under the bed.

An automatic light guides children if they need to get up in the middle of the night.

The bed is available online and at Sleep Number stores in the US from around $1,000 (£659).
