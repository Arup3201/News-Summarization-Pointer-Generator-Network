A satellite that can spot asteroids on collision course with our planet which previously could not be seen due to their close proximity to the sun is to be launched into space next month.

Until now, astronomers have not been able to see asteroids that orbit between Earth and the sun as powerful radiation from the latter blinds telescopes on earth.

One such orbit hit the Earth in February - smashing into the Russian town of Chelyabinsk, almost 1000 miles east of Moscow.

A satellite which can spot asteroids in orbit between the sun and Earth will be launched into space next month by the European Space Agency

However, the European Space Agency (ESA) is soon to launch its Gaia space satellite - and one of its missions will be to track these previously unseen asteroids.

The £800m probe will sit in orbit 90million miles from Earth.

Gerry Gilmore, a professor of experimental 
philosophy at Cambridge University’s Institute of Astronomy, who is a 
lead scientist on the project told The Sunday Times: 'Gaia will measure all the asteroids including those between us and the sun which are the really nasty ones because we cannot see them.'

However, the main goal of the Gaia mission is to make a precise three-dimensional map of our galaxy - the Milky Way.

It will do so by photographing and surveying around one per cent of the galaxy's 100 billion stars.

During the mapping, Gaia - which is so powerful it can spot a button on the moon - will detect and accurately measure the motion of each star in its orbit around the centre of the Galaxy.

It is hoped that by creating a detailed map of the stars, the probe will provide a tool to help scientists study the formation of the Milky Way.

Those behind the probe hope that Gaia will make other discoveries during its five-year lifetime, including planets around other stars, icy bodies in the outer Solar System and even far-distant supernovae.

Gilmore added: 'Gaia
will follow a billion stars for five or six years, plotting their 
movements 80 times so that we can work out their exact tracks.'

Earlier this week, Nasa issued a 'reality check' on news that an asteroid could hit Earth on August 26, 2032.

The Crimean Astrophysical Observatory found the massive asteroid, called 2013 TV135, last weekend.

The international scientific community has already rated it as one of the two most dangerous asteroids ever recorded.

But
Nasa said that the probability of an Earth impact is only one in 
63,000.That means astronomers are 99.9984 per cent certain that it will 
miss Earth's orbit.

The Earth has frequently been hit by 
asteroids - with perhaps the most famous being the impact 65m years ago 
that is thought to have contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs.

Another best-known hit was in 1908 when a small asteroid exploded above Siberia with the force of a nuclear bomb.

Geologists have also found hundreds of craters from smaller impacts, including one under what is now the North Sea.
