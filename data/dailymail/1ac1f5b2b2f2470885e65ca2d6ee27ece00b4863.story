Britain could impose even stricter rules on migrant benefits after Germany launched a major crackdown on welfare tourism.

Angela Merkel’s government is to deport any EU nationals lying to claim benefits and block the worst offenders from returning for up to five years.

The announcement prompted calls for Britain to follow suit, and Downing Street said it was considering further changes to the rules in this country.

David Cameron has been urged to copy moves by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to deport immigrants caught defrauding the welfare system

The proposed law has been dubbed ‘whoever lies, flies’. In addition to promising removal for benefit cheats, it includes prison sentences of up to three years for those convicted of making false statements about their residency status.

Anyone wanting to stay in Germany for more than six months will be required to show they have a job or are likely to get one. And there will be a crackdown on those claiming to be self-employed to claim benefits. 

Downing Street said the German announcement could give fresh impetus to changes to the rules in Britain. 

Former welfare minster Frank Field said immigrants should be kicked out of the country if they break the law

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘We have led the way with a series of measures to tackle abuses, tighten immigration routes and toughen up the rules on access to UK benefits – and we are now seeing Germany take similar action.

‘Freedom of movement is not a freedom to pick and choose where to claim benefits.

‘I believe there is a growing consensus in Europe on the need for change and we will continue to work with others to make that happen.’

From November, Mr Duncan Smith will reduce the amount of time EU migrants can claim out of work benefits to three months. They already have to wait three months before they can make a claim.

EU nationals are not usually considered for deportation unless they are given a jail sentence of two years or more.

They can in theory be removed if they are not exercising their rights by working or studying. The German government insists the measures comply with existing EU law.

But the tougher approach will be a major boost to David Cameron as he seeks to push the EU towards tighter rules on welfare tourism.

A No 10 spokesman welcomed Germany’s move, saying it showed that other EU countries share the UK’s concerns about benefit tourism. ‘They have come to the same conclusions as us about what is possible under the existing EU rules,’ he said.

‘Clearly there is now a case for looking at other things we want to do where we may need to change the rules.’

Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands are also understood to sympathise with the drive to curb the excesses of the EU’s free movement rules.

Former welfare minister Frank Field urged the Government to follow Berlin’s lead.

He said: ‘Anyone up in court and found guilty should be deported. Why should we put up with people who are breaking our laws?’

The German proposal, which is expected to become law next year, is a response to concerns over the influx of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants.

Interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said: ‘We believe we can get control of this problem and yet at the same time maintain freedom of movement.’
