While Steffon Armitage continues to explore the possibility of representing France his brother, Delon, has claimed their exile across the Channel partly stems from England adopting a top-heavy selection policy.

‘The reason I left London Irish was the coaches from England pretty much saying, “If you’re not in the top four teams, you’re not going to play for England again”,’ said the Toulon full back. ‘I could have stayed at Irish and finished sixth or seventh and not played for England.’

He has a point. The latest England line-up, against New Zealand in Hamilton in June, featured 14 players from clubs in the top five of the Aviva Premiership last season: Saracens, Northampton, Leicester, Harlequins and Bath. Wasps lock Joe Launchbury was the only intruder, with his club finishing seventh.

In all, nine of the league’s 12 clubs were represented in that England match-day 23, so it was in fact a reasonable spread of players from throughout the division. Northampton’s five-man contingent was the largest, reflecting their title-winning season.

The bottom line is that Stuart Lancaster, along with coaches of other leading nations, sets a lot of store on primary European matches and major league head-to-heads, which provide the nearest simulation of international rugby.

On that basis, Delon Armitage is right that national selection will inevitably reflect the balance of power at any given time. Perhaps it would be good for the bigger-picture if the team was founded on a wider base, but that is unrealistic. The cream will rise, unless a root-and-branch overhaul produces an unthinkable draft system.

Instead, the likes of London Irish must continue to strive to lower the colours of richer rivals, as they so nearly did to Saracens last weekend — and rail against any sense of serving merely as feeder clubs for others with larger budgets.

Quote of the week

Even in the aftermath of his Leicester team’s 45-0 drubbing in Bath, Richard Cockerill was in fine form with the media. Responding to questions about the club’s training regime in light of their injury crisis, he said: ‘Maybe we’ll just go to Costa and go go-karting! If I took them go-karting, some b****** would get run over! We train twice on Tuesday and Thursday. It didn’t harm us (Leicester teams he played in) — we were quite good then!’

While the Rugby Championship rages on in Cape Town and La Plata on Saturday, the most important match in a World Cup context will take place in a frozen, remote Siberian city.

Krasnoyarsk hosts the first leg of a qualification match between Russia and Uruguay, which will decide who snatches the last tournament place in England’s pool.

It promises to be an intriguing duel, as the visitors lie 19th in the IRB rankings, one place above their hosts, while four of the past five meetings between the nations since 2008 have been won by seven points or fewer.

Officially, the world game’s leading administrators will remain neutral, but no doubt they would be glad to see ‘The Bears’ reach next year’s event on these shores — in the hope that a potentially huge market will increasingly embrace the sport.

Sir John Kirwan will take charge of the Barbarians for autumn matches against Australia and Leicester, with the task of ensuring the invitational side remain relevant. After a high-calibre squad were dismantled 59-8 by the Lions in Hong Kong in June last year, the concept and future of the side was again in doubt. However, a side coached by Dean Ryan went some way to redressing the balance by beating an England XV 39-29 in June and now it falls to Kirwan to oversee a competitive game against the Wallabies at Twickenham on November 1, to justify ticket sales which have already passed 50,000.
