FA Cup giant-killers Bradford City finally made it on to live television but viewers were treated to blood-and-thunder rather than a feast of football.

Bantams striker Jon Stead rightly described it as a ‘dogfight’ and the lasting image was blood pouring out of the broken nose of Reading centre-half Alex Pearce in injury-time. It was that sort of game. ‘No goals, but a classic cup tie,’ remarked Reading boss Steve Clarke with a smile.

League One Bradford were furious their fifth-round tie against Sunderland wasn’t selected by broadcasters despite their remarkable 4-2 win at Chelsea in the previous round.

This was their big chance to show the nation what they could do. 

The atmosphere and commitment were 9/10, but the quality of football, and a bobbly pitch, would have been a turn-off for viewers.

The woodwork was struck three times — once by Bradford, twice by Reading — but they were rare moments of penalty-area drama.

Championship side Reading were determined not to go the same way as Aston Villa, Arsenal, Chelsea and Sunderland who have all been beaten by 2013 Capital One Cup finalists Bradford in the last few seasons, and Clarke — who won the FA Cup as a Chelsea player in 1997 — was unapologetic for sticking an extra man in midfield and trying to stifle the game as a contest.

‘We were always going to scrap, roll up our sleeves and fight for very second ball,’ he said.

History weighed heavily on both teams. Reading hadn’t been to an FA Cup semi-final since 1927. For Bradford, managed by ex-Royals player Phil Parkinson, the wait had stretched back even further to 1911.

With every Bradford fan arriving with a claret-and-amber scarf, the atmosphere was colourful and noisy.

Crunching tackles by Stephen Darby and Gary Liddle could be heard from the back of the stands while James Hanson and Stead steamed into any defender that moved. Not that Reading were shrinking violets, Chelsea loanee Nathaniel Chalobah winded Liddle with his first strong challenge from behind.

Reading took time to come to terms with being in the bearpit but produced a neat bit of football after 18 minutes when Jamie Mackie’s cross reached Pavel Pogrebnyak and the Russian spun and struck the post in one movement.

Bradford responded with their own opportunity, Liddle’s cross-shot deceiving Adam Federici and also striking the upright.

Referee Neil Swarbrick got into the FA Cup spirit and let go many challenges that would have been penalised in the Premier League. Remarkably, he showed only one yellow card all afternoon, to Bradford’s Rory McArdle.

Bradford dominated the second half and went close through Hanson and Andrew Davies. Reading hit the post again when Pogrebnyak deflected Oliver Norwood’s free-kick with his arm. The officials missed the infringement so it was lucky for them the ball didn’t go in.

Even in injury-time, no quarter was given. When Pearce went up in the air with Francois Zoko, he clashed heads with the Bradford man and injured himself in the process.

Play was stopped as blood streamed from Pearce’s nose. In keeping with the game, he went off to get patched up but came back on to see out time. ‘Wipe the blood off and back on, he’s a proper centre-half,’ said Clarke, proudly. Fans got an eyeful as Pearce stripped down to his underpants along the touchline so he could change his bloodied shirt and shorts as quickly possible before returning to the fray.

‘It was a dogfight,’ reflected Stead, who has scored in every round in this season’s competition. ‘It was two teams going at it. We feel we can do better. We pinned them in the second half but needed to score. We’ll give it everything in the replay.’

That will take place a week tomorrow to avoid Uefa rules on clashing with the Champions League. It means Bradford and Reading will play two matches in three days. ‘Frustrating, it devalues the competition,’ said Clarke.

The Reading boss admitted his spoiling tactics were devised after watching Bradford over-run Sunderland at Valley Parade last month. ‘We knew what to expect, no quarter asked or given,’ he said.

Parkinson said: ‘They came with an extra man in midfield. It was a different challenge to the Sunderland game but I thought we did well.’

Clarke refuses to see his side as favourites for the replay even though they play a division higher than Bradford and have home advantage at the Madjeski. ‘I said it was a 50-50 game when the draw was made and I still think that now,’ he said.
