Former Royal Australian Navy personnel have revealed they are emotionally scarred after pulling dead asylum seekers from the ocean during border protection operations.

Members of Operation Resolute, the Navy's asylum seeker interception unit, have uncovered the horrors of stopping refugee boats on the north coast of Australia.

The sailors, all of whom served under the previous government, spoke of horrific tasks such as retrieving bloated corpses and finding 70-mile expanses of bodies, according to the ABC.

Troy Norris was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, following 13 years of intercepting asylum seeker boats.

'There'd been times where we had to do body recoveries, which was quite difficult and traumatising,' Mr Norris said. 

'The people had been in the water for quite a period of time ... they became quite bloated and there's only one way to pull them in and that's to grab them and try and chuck them in the boat.

'Sometimes you'd go to pull these people in the boat and all you'd end up with is a handful of flesh. It'd just strip to the bone.'

Norris also told ABC he was callously discharged from the Navy when he showed signs of experiencing trauma.

Another Navy officer, referred to as Michael, recollected a time when Operation Resolute followed government suggestions to not to intercept a boat approaching Australian borders which had begun to sink.

By the time they arrived 15 hours later, there was 'about 70 miles long of bodies. We fished them out for as long as we could, 'til we were full. And that wasn't uncommon.'

Australian Defence have claimed the rates of mental health problems among Navy members is low

In a statement, the Australian Defence said that the rates of mental health problems among Operation Resolute members are low.

'The data arising from mental health screening shows that the majority of personnel assigned to Operation Resolute are dealing well with the pressures associated with operational deployment.'

'Reported rates of mental health-related symptoms are low.

'Throughout their careers, Royal Australian Navy members receive a wide range of training in mental health from annual training, deployment-specific training and targeted programs regarding suicide awareness and prevention, alcohol management and early recognition and treatment of emerging mental health issues.' 

'The preservation of life at sea is the highest priority for the commanders of all vessels ... assigned to Border Protection Command from the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service'
