Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has revealed he is worried that rivals Manchester City might now be leading the way when it comes to player recruitment in the local area.

The retired star believes local kids would have done anything to sign for Manchester United when he was a young boy, but the pendulum has now swung to the blue half of Manchester.

Scholes, writing in his column for the Independent, said: 'When I was a kid, it was the case among the lads I played football with that if Manchester United wanted to sign you then joining Manchester City was not even a consideration.

Paul Scholes, working as a pundit, believes Manchester City now have the ability to attract the top young stars

'United did not have to persuade or offer inducements. We would have walked there ourselves.

'Thirty years on, and the picture in Manchester is very different and, as a United fan, it worries me.

'Trying to look at it from a neutral perspective I have to say that what City have achieved is impressive and their impact on the youth scene in Manchester began long before the opening of their City Football Academy this week.'

Scholes claims players such as Tyler Blackett (left) and Paddy McNair are just stop-gaps in their defence

Scholes has also questioned whether the likes of Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett will be at Manchester United in the long run of if they are just stop-gaps.

'The FA Youth Cup is just one way of taking the temperature of a club’s academy. United have a fantastic history in producing players and there will always be boys who will want to come to the club.

'The issue is whether they are good enough for the first team. Some of the current lads who have been promoted, such as Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett, have benefited from an injury crisis but will they be there in the long term? James Wilson clearly has a chance of making the grade.'
