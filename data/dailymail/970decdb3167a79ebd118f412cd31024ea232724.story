Vincent Kompany and his Manchester City team-mates were out training on Tuesday as the club captain ramped up his attempt to reclaim his place in the side.

The Belgium international was dropped for City's last game - where they beat Leicester 2-0 - but will be hopeful he can return for their clash with Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday. 

The rest of the players looked in high spirits as they trained. Sergio Aguero and Samir Nasri could be seen laughing and joking during Manuel Pellegrini's session.

Pellegrini's side have struggled in recent months, winning just four of their last 11 matches in all competitions.

But the league champions will be hoping to build on last week's win when they travel to Turf Moor by winning back-to-back games for only the third time this year.

City are currently five points behind table-topping Chelsea in the Premier League, although Jose Mourinho's men have a game in hand.

Perhaps more worrying for City is that their dip in form since the turn of the year has allowed both Arsenal and Manchester United to gain ground on them. The Gunners are just four points behind while United trail by four.
