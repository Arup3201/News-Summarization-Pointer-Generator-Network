As a busy TV host and a mother-of-three, Kelly Ripa certainly has a lot on her plate, and now she has revealed the secrets to her success.

In an interview with Bobbi Brown for Yahoo! Beauty, the 44-year-old explains that it takes her less than an hour to get ready for her show, Live! with Kelly and Michael, thanks to 'the tag team' who have been doing her hair and make-up for 14 years.

'They do hair and makeup at the same time that I'm getting briefed,' she said. 'And my wardrobe is simple; it's just put out the night before. It's so easy; it's a streamlined operation.'

Time-savers: Kelly (with Joaquin Phoenix on her show on Tuesday) explains that it takes her less than an hour to get ready for thanks to 'the tag team' who have been doing her hair and make-up for 14 years

Kelly, who has three children with her husband of 18 years Mark Consuelos, is famously petite at just 5ft 3in, and her athletic physique seems only to get better with age.

And while she does try to break a sweat every day, the former All My Children star says her rock-hard abs come naturally.

'So much of it is genetic,' she said in the interview. 'I work out a lot, but the place I find I don't really focus on is my stomach because I've always sort of had a very strong core.'

Instead, she focuses on working out her arms and legs, which do require regular exercise to stay toned.

'Everybody has their thing, like their body part that's good, and everybody has their body part that's not so good,' Kelly explained.

She added that she was born with a muscular physique, and that some people might find it 'objectionable'.

'There are people that like a curvy physique. I've never had a curvy physique and I will never have one. If I gained weight, I would just look like a larger more muscular version of myself... That’s just the way I'm built.'

Even so, Kelly has revealed in the past that she has a penchant for high-intensity workouts like SoulCycle, and she regularly trains with Gwyneth Paltrow's trainer and close friend Tracy Anderson.

She's also an avid fan of AKT INMOTION, a cardio dance training class run by her personal trainer Anna Kaiser.

When it comes to diet, Kelly makes an effort to eat healthily most of the time. 'For the most part... I eat a very clean diet,' she says. 'I have lots of vegetables, I eat protein, but I really don't put a ton of thought into it.'

To maintain a balanced diet, she stays active and avoids junk food - except for the occasional treat. 

The star revealed that she has a drawer in her home filled with candy for when Bravo host Andy Cohen visits, since he apparently has a sweet tooth.

'I've been dipping into that a lot lately,' she confessed. 'I reward myself because he;s on a book tour I guess!'
