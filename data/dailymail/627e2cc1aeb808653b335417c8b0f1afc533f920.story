CENTURIES OF CHANGE by Ian Mortimer (The Bodley Head £20)

People can get by without laptops but not without buttons, introduced in the 1330s, which transformed the way people looked, from loose hanging garments to tight-fitting ones

This original and fascinating book sets out to discover which of the ten centuries from 1000 to 2000 saw the most change in the human condition.

Surely, most of us would say, it can only be the 20th century? Flying, mass motoring, space travel, advanced weapons, atomic power, telephones, radio and television, computers and iPads — what more change do you want?

Ah, says the historian Ian Mortimer, history is not just a matter of inventions. More important are changes in the conditions under which we live and, above all, in the ideas that are ruling at any one time.

Many crucial inventions are ones we take for granted. People can get by without laptops but not without buttons, introduced in the 1330s, which transformed the way people looked, from loose hanging garments to tight-fitting ones.

The moon landing was a giant step for mankind but it did not affect daily life as much as the invention of glass mirrors around 1500. For the first time they enabled you to see what you looked like. Think of the consequences. People could see themselves as individuals, not just units in a group. It led to a demand for painted portraits, self-portraits, autobiography and general self-consciousness.

Think of how life indoors was transformed in the 1500s with the coming of efficient chimneys to take the smoke out and glass windows to let the light in (but not the cold). Or the coming of gas light in the streets in the 1820s and soon afterwards in the home with the boon of a gas cooker instead of the coal-fired range from 1834.

Electric light bulbs (1870) led to all kind of electrically powered appliances — kettles, toasters, fans and sewing machines by the end of the 19th century. And the Great Exhibition of 1851 unveiled the flushing lavatory which soon led to dedicated bathrooms for the well-to-do.

Public clocks on towers (from about 1400) became domestic in late 1600s — Charles II was very proud of his — but you had to wait till the 19th century to tell the time by your wrist watch.

Columbus discovered the New World in 1492 but America’s existence made little difference to life for the average European except for the novelty of potatoes, tomatoes and tobacco.

Most people would say the 20th century saw the most advancement with the rise of new technologies

Tea, coffee and chocolate did not appear till the 17th century, along with Dutch gin, French brandy, champagne and humble lemonade.

Knowledge of the world was greatly expanded by the explorers of the 16th century, including Francis Drake the circumnavigator. But amazing new worlds were opened up by Galileo and Kepler, who invented the telescope and microscope from 1610.

Even more mind-changing was not the discovery of what the surface of the moon actually looked like — which turned out to be bare and boring — but the photograph taken by an astronaut from moon orbit of the shining, blue and white Earth rising out of black space.

Mortimer calls it ‘probably the most important photograph ever taken’. Nothing so vividly brought home to earthlings how small, how vulnerable and how exceptional among heavenly bodies our planet is.

It is a planetary ride which Mortimer offers us in his tour of ten centuries. It is exhilarating to time-travel with him, free of the complexities of dynasties, wars and politics that normally clutter up history.

The 11th century, for example, can be summarised as a century of building castles. After Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy, found conquering England a pushover — towns had no walled defences. He promptly built the Tower of London and his followers on their newly acquired lands followed suit.

The 14th century was devastated by the Black Death. As it sped across Europe it turned into the most traumatic event in history up to that time — and perhaps ever since

The 14th century was devastated by the Black Death. As it sped across Europe it turned into the most traumatic event in history up to that time — and perhaps ever since.

Sweeping over England in 1348-9, it killed 45 per cent of the population in seven months — to kill the equivalent number now you would have to drop two atom bombs (of Hiroshima size) every day for seven months.

The plague was to recur in the 1360s and 70s and about every ten years for three more centuries. In 1563, it cost London 20 per cent of its population.

Yet society did not collapse. One consequence was a general pay rise for labourers because they were now so scarce.

The 18th-century Enlightenment elevated reason over superstition, putting paid to the savage persecution and hanging of so-called witches. Rousseau and Tom Paine persuaded men to think of themselves as free and equal, leading to American Independence and the French Revolution, both much aided by the new newspapers dispensing free speech and free thought.

Mortimer debates whether people’s thinking was most changed by Darwin or by Karl Marx. He opts for Marx for introducing the dream of a classless, equal society — the kernel of socialism

The 19th century probably produced the most inventions that changed lives through the industrial and transport revolutions, using steam power. The population of England soared faster than anywhere else in Europe. People flocked to the cities looking for work.

‘Cities sucked the life out of rural England and the railways were the straws by which they did it,’ writes Mortimer memorably.

Reform Bills increased the voting population but even after the third, in 1888, the electorate was only five million out of a population of 22 million. They were all men, of course. The serfdom of women began to be lifted when they were allowed to keep their own property when married. But men were still free to beat their wives or even to sell them at country fair auctions.

So which century brought the most change? That depends on the field of change that you reckon most important. The 16th and 19th century probably caused more radical change in ordinary people’s lives by increasing how much food, heat and shelter was available.

As a result the population grew far more than in other centuries. But the 20th century brought the biggest increase in life expectancy and personal wealth (GDP per head), sexual equality and crime reduction. Does the rise of liberal democracy as the goal of most western societies mean that we have reached stability and the ‘end of history’?

No, answers Mortimer, because our present prosperity is unsustainable. Endless growth is impossible. The Earth’s limited resources are being exhausted ever faster by ever-increasing numbers of humans.

In a sombre last chapter on ‘Why it matters’, he predicts the future, beginning in this very century of declining civilisation as supplies of oil, gas, water and land begin to be exhausted.Unless we manage to reduce consumption to sustainable levels, the future will be one of anarchy —the war of the rich holding on to what they’ve got against the poor who will get ever poorer.

The outlook, he says, is fearsome. Can we believe in human progress? If we do, it may not be for much longer.
