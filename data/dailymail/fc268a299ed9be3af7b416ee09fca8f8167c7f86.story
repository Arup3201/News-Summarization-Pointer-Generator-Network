A talented teenager died after accidentally overdosing on insulin taken for her diabetes, just days before she was due to audition on The X Factor.

Bethany Durose played piano and clarinet, and was having singing lessons from a professional opera singer in preparation for her performance on the TV talent show when tragedy struck.

But just days before her performance in front of judge Gary Barlow, the 17-year-old was found by her horrified parents unconscious at their home in Holmrook, Cumbria.

Tragic: Young musician Bethany Durose had been allocated an X Factor audition slot but died just five days before she was due to perform

The diabetic teen was rushed to hospital with extremely low blood sugar levels, which caused her significant brain damage.

The hearing on Monday was told that musician Bethany had struggled with her condition throughout her teenage years and 'hated' the fact she had diabetes.

Her heartbroken mother told an inquest this week how the teenager was occasionally not as disciplined as she needed to be when it came to medicating herself.

Patrician Durose said her daughter was 'in denial' about the condition, and rather than taking regular injections, would prefer to administer a larger dose of insulin at the end of each day.

Promising: The talented singer was said to 'hate' having to live with diabetes throughout her teenage years

Bethany was rushed to West Cumberland Hospital after being found by her parents, but died on March 21 last year, just five days before her allocated slot at the Manchester X Factor auditions.

Her devastated mother Patricia said: 'She had a really excellent voice and was looking forward to seeing where her audition for The X-Factor was going to take her.

'She played clarinet to grade five and piano to grade four, but it was the singing that she really loved and wanted to pursue.

'She was having lessons with a professional opera singer and had achieved grade seven and was working towards her grade eight.

'Bethany had been allocated a time slot to audition, and planned to perform Eva Cassidy’s Somewhere Over the Rainbow.'

Coroner
David Roberts, presiding over Monday’s hearing, recorded a verdict of 
accidental death, after hearing evidence that she had struggled with her
diabetes throughout her teenage years.

Mr
and Mrs Durose revealed that their daughter 'hated' the fact that she 
had the condition and was occasionally not as disciplined as she needed 
to be when it came to medicating herself.

Following
Mr Roberts’ verdict, Anna Morton, the director of NHS Diabetes, offered
support for other young people with the condition.

She said: 'Diabetes is for life. 
People with diabetes need both clinical and emotional support to help 
them manage the everyday aspects of their condition.

Plans: Bethany had been due to perform at the X Factor auditions in Manchester last year, but was struck down five days before her allocated slot

Tragic teen Bethany Durose's mother Patricia said the 17-year-old had been looking forward to performing in the audition stage of the TV talent show

'The
daily need for people with type one (insulin dependent) diabetes to 
monitor their blood sugar and give multiple, carefully-calculated 
insulin injections can be difficult at any age, but is particularly 
challenging for young people.

'That is why NHS Diabetes has established regional networks.

'It
is also why NHS Diabetes is working with the National Clinical Director
for Diabetes to help improve the care of young people with diabetes 
moving from paediatric to adult services.'
