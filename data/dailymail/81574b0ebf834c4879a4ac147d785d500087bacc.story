A South African nursery school teacher has been caught transporting 19 children in her Renault Clio.

Melanie Minnie was stopped as she carried a class of children aged between four and six on a school trip to a shopping mall burger bar.

Police officers were shocked to discover she had six children in the small car's boot; at least three on the front seat and the remaining ten on the car's back seat.

It is unclear whether any were wearing seat belts.

A local newspaper photographer was on the scene to capture striking images of the children squashed into the tiny car.

Nico
 van Heerden said police had been tipped off about the safety breach by a
 concerned shopper at Pretoria's Jacaranda shopping mall who saw the 
teacher loading the children into her car.

Police
 stopped her a block away from the shopping centre, the photographer 
said, as she made the mile-long journey to the Rietfontein nursery 
school.

Far from being 
uncomfortable, however, the children seemed relatively comfortable and 
excited by the action, Mr van Heerden claimed.

He said: 'They were excited at first, but after a while they started to get a more worried and cried.'

'This is the first time we went on an outing - and the last': Ms Minnie told police she had already transported a first group of 12 children in her car

Ms Minnie was quoted in South Africa's Afrikaans language Beeld newspaper 'this is the first time we went on an outing - and the last time'.

According to the paper, Ms Minnie was stopped while in the process of ferrying the second of two car-loads of children back to her nursery from the mall.

She told police she had already transported a first group of 12 children in her car.

Police spokeswoman Charmaine Louwrens said the teacher was fined R1,500 (just over £100) for having more people in a car that it was designed to carry.
