Hero: Sergeant Johnson Beharry is showing off his newborn son Ayden in an interview with Hello! magazine

Military hero Johnson Beharry, who became the first recipient of the Victoria Cross for more than two decades in 2005, has had tiny replicas of his medals made for his newborn son.

Sergeant Beharry, 34, showed off his son Ayden for the first time in an interview with Hello! magazine and said that he never imagined he would become a father.

He was the first serviceman honoured with the VC in 23 years after risking his life to save his colleagues in Iraq, suffering horrific injuries in the process.

Sergeant Beharry told the magazine: 'Before Iraq I never imagined being a dad. I lived on the edge and thought it was inevitable that I would die.

'I wonder how I survived. Everyone tells me I must be here for a reason. Maybe it is my work with my charity. But it's also for Ayden.'

Beharry, who still bears the scars of his ordeal, including a titanium plate in his skull, married second wife Mallissa in March, just five months after they met.

He said of his son: 'I love him so much that I don't want to go to bed, I just want to be with him.

'I hold him and watch him as he sleeps, then stay awake until dawn. My job is being on guard in the army, so it comes naturally to me.'

Beharry - who has appeared on ITV's Dancing On Ice series - said he had the mini replica medals done for his son as a tribute to him.

His wife said he was a hands-on father adding: 'He loves being with him. Whenever he speaks, Ayden opens his eyes and tries to find him. Johnson wants to be involved with everything.'

Honour: Beharry became the first person to be awarded the Victoria Cross since the Falklands War

Serviceman: He was awarded the honour after he risked his own life and suffered horrendous injuries saving the lives of some of his colleagues in Iraq

The couple tied the knot at London's Old Marylebone Hotel in March in front of family and friends, before moving on to a later blessing.

They announced soon after that they were expecting their first child.

The Grenada-born soldier said at the time: ‘It's a little sooner than planned, but we are over the moon.

‘Mallissa and I felt strongly that it was important to marry before our baby arrives.

'I didn't grow up with a mum and dad who were together and all my life I've said I don't want my child to say the same and that I want them to know they've got that solid foundation.’

Beharry received his VC for two acts of bravery.

In the first he led a patrol to safety after being ambushed and under heavy fire, and in the other he saved the lives of several colleagues despite suffering brain and facial injuries from a grenade.

He split from first wife Lynthia in 2005 as a result of the traumatic experiences he endured.

Beharry became the first recipient in 2005 of the Victoria Cross since the Falklands War of 1982.

He is one of only six living recipients of the VC.

Johnson Beharry was born one of eight children on the Caribbean island of Grenada in 1979.

He moved to Britain in 1999, joining the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment in 2001, serving first in Kosovo then Northern Ireland.
