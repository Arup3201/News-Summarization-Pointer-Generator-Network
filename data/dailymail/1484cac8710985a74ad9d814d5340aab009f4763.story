This chilled-out baboon kicked back on a bench in the sunshine - and entirely refused to budge up for tired tourists.

The baboon jumped in to claim the comfy seat ahead of tired walkers hiking near Victoria Falls in Zambia.

Instead of moving off when they approached, these photographs show one particularly brazen one just sucking its finger in defiance.

Favourite bench: A Chacma baboon reclined in the sun at Victoria Falls and decided he wasn't going to budge

Cheeky monkey: He impolitely began sucking his finger as tourists try to coax him off the seat

Unruffled: The baboons at Victoria Falls are very used to tourists so they could not be shooed away

It presented the perfect photo opportunity for 33-year-old tourist Chantelle Stobbe from Saskatoon, Canada.

She had just been climbing up a steep path leading to the famous waterfalls when a group of Chacma baboons ran across her.

She said: 'I was wondering where all the baboons were, as I had been told there would be many.

'All of a sudden a troop of about 15 came out of nowhere.

Their territory: None of the baboons felt inclined to move, however much the weary tourists wanted to sit down

Keeping an eye out: The baboons wearily watched the tourists move away from their patch

Extreme relaxation: Overwhelmed by the head of the summer months, this baboon just lay flat out on the path

There were babies and their mums, juveniles, and adults. The young ones were running around and playing.

'A large adult lay down right on the pathway blocking my way and then another climbed onto the bench. He just sat there owning it.'

Baboons at Victoria Falls are famously very bold.

In the past they have reportedly stolen and other items from unwitting tourists.

Watchful: A baboon eyed up the hikers, clearly waiting for them to leave

On the look out: Eventually the tourists left the baboons to enjoy their domain in peace
