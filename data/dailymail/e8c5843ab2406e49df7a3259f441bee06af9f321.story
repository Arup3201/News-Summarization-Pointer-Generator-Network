Denial: Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell insists he did not call police officers in Downing Street 'plebs'

Under pressure Tory Andrew Mitchell has again denied that he called Downing Street police officers 'plebs' in an abusive tirade launched after they refused to open a gate.

In an interview on Whitehall this morning he apologised for his actions but continued to question the truth of a police report that directly contradicts his version of events.

Despite this, David Cameron has now decided not to hold any official investigation into what has happened.

That decision was confirmed tonight with Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood saying he agreed with the PM that there would not be 'any purpose' in a probe after Mr Mitchell apologised for the incident.

In a letter to shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, the civil servant wrote: 'There clearly remains a genuine difference of view about what words were actually used.

'But Andrew Mitchell has acknowledged that his words and behaviour were inappropriate and he failed to show proper respect for the police.'

The Chief Whip, who is refusing to resign, admitted at the weekend he had sworn during the confrontation with officers who guard the Prime Minister's residence.

Mr Mitchell again reiterated his apology after not showing the police 'the amount of respect I should have done' during the confrontation last week.

But asked if he called the officer a 'pleb', he said: 'I want to make it absolutely clear that I did not use the words attributed to me.

'I have apologised to the police, I have apologised to the police officer involved on the gate and he's accepted my apology and I hope very much that we can draw a line under it there,' he said.

But the report from police, leaked last night, specifically says he used the word when officers refused to open the gate at the end of Downing Street to let him cycle out.

The Met has also said he will investigate how it was leaked.

The outburst occurred on Wednesday – the day after two female police officers were murdered on duty in Manchester.

The report raises questions over whether Mr Mitchell misled the Prime Minister when he denied using the word.

Mr Mitchell, who arrived in Whitehall in a VW Polo, accepted that he should not have spoken to the officers in the way that he did.

'It had been the end of a long and extremely frustrating day - not that that is any excuse at all for what happened,' he said.

'I didn't show the police the amount of respect I should have done. We should all respect the police, they do an incredibly difficult job.'

However he made clear that he was determined to resist calls for his resignation.

'I am now going to go in and get on with my work. Thank you very much indeed,' he said.

Despite Mr Mitchell’s attempt to draw a line under the row,
two senior Liberal Democrats today said he still had questions to answer.

Claims: Mr Mitchell said he had apologised to the police involved, who had accepted it

Jeremy Browne, the crime prevention minister, said the chief
whip had to tie up the ‘loose ends’.

“I know there’s a big media debate about what this says
about the Conservative party; whether it means the Conservatives are out of
touch and whether they sound like they’re taking down to people,’ he told BBC
News.

‘I think people want to know what was said. I can understand
as well why people fell that we need to get to the bottom of it, and explaining
to the media what was not said is not the same as explaining to the media what
was said, so there is a sort of sense of all the loose ends not being tied up.’

And former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell warned that
until Mr Mitchell was ‘able to say, unequivocally to say, what it was he said
and to frame his apology around that’ then the story would ‘still have legs’.

Labour has demanded a full inquiry into the affair. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘Andrew Mitchell’s account of what went on is unravelling day by day and we need to know exactly what happened.

‘David Cameron cannot dismiss this incident and hope it goes away.’ The accounts of the Downing Street police and Mr Mitchell are markedly different.

In the report, the police allege he said: ‘Best you learn your ****ing place. You don’t run this ****ing government. You are ****ing plebs.’

The officer who wrote his report for his superiors only hours after the incident said he did so because Mr Mitchell told him: ‘You haven’t heard the last of this.’

The policeman said: ‘I write this for your information as Mr Mitchell’s last comments would appear to indicate he is unhappy with my actions.’

Rebuttal: 'I want to make it absolutely clear that I did not use the words attributed to me,' Mr Mitchell said

This official police report, leaked to The Sun, is in line with what was reported on Friday.

In response to that story, Mr Mitchell
issued a statement: ‘While I do not accept that I used any of the words
that have been reported, I accept I did not treat the police with the 
respect they deserve.’

Sources close to the minister then specifically briefed newspapers to deny he had used the word ‘plebs’.

The report reveals how polite the 
officers insist they were to Mr Mitchell until they were forced to warn 
him he would be arrested under the Public Order Act if he swore at them 
again.

Hanging on: Andrew Mitchell on his bicycle at the gates to Downing Street

In contrast, Mr Mitchell has claimed 
that after asking officers to open the main gates to Downing Street for 
his bicycle, and being refused, he did not swear directly at police. He 
simply said: ‘You guys are supposed to ****ing help us.’

A friend of the minister said at the 
weekend that he was ‘100 per cent adamant’ he had not used the word 
‘plebs’ or ‘morons’, although he was not calling anybody a liar.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said 
yesterday the Chief Whip had been ‘wrong’ to lose his temper, but added 
that if no new revelations emerged about the confrontation, Mr Mitchell 
should be able to remain in his post.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: 
‘Unless something comes to light about the rival versions, about what 
was and what was not said that I don’t know about, I think he should 
apologise in full – he’s done that, that’s right – and draw a line under
it in that way.’

Yesterday, Communities Secretary Eric 
Pickles said he was ‘very proud to be a pleb’ as he criticised Mr 
Mitchell for his outburst.

The Tory Cabinet minister, who grew up
in the working-class West Yorkshire town of Keighley, said the 
beleaguered Chief Whip had used ‘ungentlemanly and ungallant language’ –
but should not lose his job for having a ‘bad temper’.

He said: ‘I think it would be wrong to
say that either party is lying, but what is very clear is that Andrew 
Mitchell used ungentlemanly and ungallant language which he regrets and 
he has apologised both to the police and to the Prime Minister.’

Sources close to Mr Mitchell said he 
would be ‘relaxed’ about an investigation into the outburst, because he 
was ‘confident’ of his case.
