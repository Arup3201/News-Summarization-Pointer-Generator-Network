Wembley Stadium once again established itself as the home of the NFL outside American shores as 84,000 fans flocked to see the Oakland Raider host the Miami Dolphins in the ninth International Series game.

Now in its eighth year, the national stadium was awash with colour as fans of all 32 franchises attended a range of American football-themed events outside the national stadium.

Punters queued for pictures with the Vince Lombardi Trophy and autographs of NFL legends, while people of all ages were asked to test their passing and kicking skills.

Following Saturday's rally on Regent Street which played host to over half a million people, American football fever is once again gripping these shores with the first of three regular season games taking place.

Next month, the Atlanta Falcons play host the Detroit Lions and the Jacksonville Jaguars entertain the Dallas Cowboys in November. All three games are sell-outs.

Writing in his MailOnline column yesterday, Vernon Kay said he believes England will host five games next season.

Englishman Mark Waller, the NFL's chief marketing officer, spoke this week of the growing appetite for gridiron in this country.

'I think the fact that we have demand to sell out three games is just fantastic,' he said. 'So I'd start with, if the challenges are around the execution of that, then that's a great set of challenges to have. I'd be worried if it was the other way around and we were going backwards.'
