These images show the heart-stopping moment a man ran away from police and into the path of a tube train.

The man was narrowly missed a second time by an Overground Line train as he went back across the tracks at Barking tube station.

The dramatic scenes happened on Saturday at 7.15pm after the unidentified man came down the concourse and spotted police officers on routine patrol.

Officers were on routine patrol at Barking station in East London when this man made eye contact with them before running away and into the path of two trains including this Overground train

He also ran in front of this eastbound District Line train in his attempts to escape from police who say they were not there to arrest him and were just on routine patrol

After making eye contact with them he immediately turned and ran, jumping across empty tracks and on to another platform.

Realising there was no way to escape, the man ran along along the platform before going back onto the tracks, crossing the path of a District Line train heading towards Upminster before jumping into the path of an Overground Line train.

The man came so close that the driver of the second train, who was travelling westbound, was forced to apply the emergency brake.

The man also ran in front of another Hammersmith and City Line train which was stationary at the time.

As he has yet to be identified, police cannot say if he is wanted in connection with any other crimes, and have no explanation for his behaviour.

The man, who hasn't been identified, ran in front of a third Hammersmith and City Line train which was stopped at the time before escaping from the station

This is the man police would like to speak to, but until they identify him they cannot say if he was wanted in connection with another crime and cannot explain his behaviour

British Transport Police have an office inside the station and often have officers on patrol there.

Investigators are now viewing CCTV footage of the incident and speaking to witnesses to try and identify the young man.

PC Church, the investigating officer, said: 'Trespass on the railway is, in itself, extremely dangerous and irresponsible, but to run in front of moving trains is putting your life on the line.

'We don’t believe the man was injured during the incident and thankfully, no one else was, but this was still extremely thoughtless behaviour.

'If you recognise the man, or have any further information about the incident, I’d urge you to come forward.'

Despite the emergency brake being used there were no delays because of the man's actions.

If you can help officers, please call British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. In all calls quote log B7/LNA of 25/09/2013.
