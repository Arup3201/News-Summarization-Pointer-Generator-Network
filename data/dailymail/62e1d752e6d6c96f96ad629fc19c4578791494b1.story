A group of lucky schoolkids were treated to a once in a lifetime encounter on Wednesday, when they witnessed Superheros Batman and Catwoman scaling down the side of one of the tallest buildings in Australia.

Bringing the kids' wildest imaginations to life, stunt-experts Rowena and Chris Davies hung off the 88th floor of Melbourne's Eureka Tower by a rope in a death-defying show, as the fascinated kids watched from behind thick glass on the observation deck.

The Eureka Tower in Southbank is the second tallest building in Australia standing at 297m tall and is the highest tower in Melbourne. It has more storeys than the Q1 skyscraper on the Gold Coast, which measures just over 322m.

According to CEO of HeartKids Norm Hutton, Bruce Wayne, which is Batman's secret identity, is the ultimate boss.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Hutton explained that Bruce Wayne was philanthropic and helped to save an entire city. 

'It would be pretty good to emulate some of his features of being a super boss.' Mr Hutton said.  

According to HeartKids, six babies are born with childhood heart disease every day in Australia, meaning one in every 100 babies are born with the chronic disease and around 2200 babies die from it every year.It is also one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of one. 

'Children that battle with childhood heart disease even before they're three of four years of age have gone through a couple of hundred procedures,' Mr Hutton said.

'Their resilience, courage and strength is inspiring'  

'These kids are heros everyday.' he said.

Speaking of the supernatural launch of the Super Boss campaign, Mr Hutton said he had chills watching the superhero stunt professionals scaling the Eureka Tower.

'Seeing Batman and Catwoman on the 88th floor was chilling for me and amazing for the children,' said Mr Hutton.

'It's a fun way for work places to engage with the issue of childhood heart disease and raise important funds.'

'The smile on the kids' faces and sparkle in their eyes keeps our staff going,' he said. 

HeartKids is a non-profit charity which supports, encourages and gives hope to children and families affected by childhood heart disease.

'A lot of bosses are letting their staff choose their costumes, so I'm not sure they know what they've gotten themselves in to.' Mr Hutton said.
