A new film seeks to ask the question just exactly who is General Tso and how did his chicken become so popular?

The documentary, from writer Jennifer 8 Lee, explores the history Chinese cuisine in the US by exploring the history of General Tso's chicken - that is actually a traditional meal from the north of China that got its military name in America by an accident of translation.

General Tso's chicken is thought to take his name from General Tso Tsung-t'ang a Qing dynasty leader who lived from 1812 until 1885.

Military leader: Qing dynasty leader General Tso Tsung-t'ang gave his name to the popular dish, but by a coincidence of translation rather than design

Respected statesman: After his role in a civil war thought to have killed 20million people, General Tso became a respected politician who lived into relatively old age. He is pictured here as the governor of Shangan province in 1875

A new film seeks to ask the age old question, just exactly who is General Tso and how did his chicken become so popular?

Born into a poor family in Hunan province, Tso became a military leader who helped the Qing dynasty win civil war known as the 'Taiping Rebellion' in which 20million people are said to have died.

He then became a respected statesman, however he would never have tasted modern-day General Tso's chicken and the fact that he gave his name to the most popular Chinese dish in America is thought to be coincidence.

An account by author Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's account is regarded as the most plausible - she says the dish is a traditional one in Hunan province, and was given the name 'ancestral hall chicken'. 

The mandarin for 'ancestral hall' happens to name with General Tso's name, and thus a confused translation is thought to have given rise to the birth of General Tso's chicken in America.  

Lee's movie follows the filmmakers from Chinese eateries in the big city to country, with each serving the spicy chicken dish to hungry American fans.

It also visits perplexed Chinese people in the General's hometown. 

'I went to his hometown. This is a billboard that says, welcome to the birthplace of General Tso,' Lee told NPR. 'And I went looking for chicken. I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who were still in the little town, showed them all the pictures of General Tso's chicken that I showed you. And they're like, we don't know this dish.'

Lee previously wrote a book called 'The Fortune Cookie Chronicles' about her interest in Americanized Chinese dishes. 

The documentary has received critical acclaim with a 93 per cent fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes.

'The film gets its charm from the Chinese restaurant owners themselves,'writes 8Asians.com reviewer Mitchell K. Dwyer. 'Some of them, second and third-generation entrepreneurs, some of them offering their observations even while their parents, sitting right next to them, offer a slightly different take.'

They also, according to NBC News, met with a retired chef in Taiwan who invented a Hunan-style chicken dish but called the modern, popular incarnation 'crazy nonsense.'

The film follows the thread of food to weave a story about cultures, immigration, and how Asian-Americans have adapted in Western culture.   

The documentary, from writer Jennifer 8 Lee, chronicles the intersection of American and Chinese cuisine so well known in westernized Chinese restaurants around the U.S.
