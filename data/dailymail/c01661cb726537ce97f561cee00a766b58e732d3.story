The U.S. Embassy worker accused of spying on Russia for the CIA has left Moscow, five days after he was publicly arrested by Russian security forces.

Video broadcast by Russia's NTV station shows Ryan Fogle going through airport security at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow before boarding a Delta Airlines flight to New York on Sunday afternoon.

Fogle, 29, a third secretary at the embassy in Moscow, was accused by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) of trying to recruit a Russian counter-terrorism expert who had recently been to Dagestan, the Russian province where Boston bombing mastermind Tamerlan Tsarnaev visited before the attacks.

Fleeing: Ryan Fogle, seen here at a Moscow airport on Sunday, was told the leave the country after he was arrested by Russian security officers

Friends: Fogle - second from right - was pictures unloading a suitcase in the airport parking lot, flanked by embassy staffers

But the FSB claimed that the Russian anti-terrorism expert he was
 hoping to lure to work for the Americans wasted no time in personally apprehending 
him, pinning him to the ground, and handing him over to the authorities.

Fogle has 
been mercilessly mocked on the web both in Russia and the West after he was pictured wearing a conspicuously fake blond wig during his arrest.

The U.S. Embassy has refused to comment on the case.

However, video shows embassy officials with Fogle as he unloads a suitcase from an SUV in the airport parking lot.

NTV cameras then track him as he stands in security lines before boarding his flight.

The network is known in Russia as being friendly to the Kremlin.

Arrested: The US diplomat was pinned to the ground and arrested by the Russian agent he was trying to recruit

Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer

Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained

Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols

The FSB stressed that the 
US and Russia 'will try to avoid ratcheting up tension around the Ryan 
Fogle case, focusing instead on the positive aspects of their 
relations'.

But Russian intelligence services say they have trapped a CIA ‘spy’ as he offered millions of pounds to a senior Russian agent.

Diplomat
 Ryan Fogle was thrown down and handcuffed in a night-time sting by the 
FSB secret service – formerly the KGB.

He had a rudimentary espionage kit 
containing a compass, map of Moscow, knives, a microphone, two wigs, 
three pairs of glasses, plastic bags containing thousands of euros and 
an RFID Shield, which prevents passports with computer chips being read 
remotely, Russian intelligence sources said.

Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB

The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia.

Famously, 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in June 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the country.

The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S.

In the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany.

One of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot.

The ‘agent’, a third secretary in the 
political section of the US embassy, was quizzed in the FSB’s feared 
Lubyanka complex before being handed over to US officials.

Unusually, the FSB made its coup 
public at once. It released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue 
checked shirt, dirty-blond wig and  baseball cap, along with images of 
him in detention.

Spy sources said Fogle was 
caught after a lengthy covert operation.

US ambassador Michael McFaul – 
who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to Russia’s 
foreign ministry.

Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said.

They implied that he wanted to contact a senior FSB agent who was snooping on Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bomber.

A letter in Russian which Fogle 
carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big 
fish.

Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you 
$100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and 
co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to 
answer certain questions.

‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’

The recruit is instructed to use an 
internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for
 staying in touch with us’.

The incident is the biggest spy 
scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other 
Russians in the US in 2010.

The FSB stated: ‘Recently, the US 
intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees 
of Russia’s law-enforcement bodies and special agencies.’

Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security'

Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested 
the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus 
bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter 
released by the FSB is genuine

Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia
