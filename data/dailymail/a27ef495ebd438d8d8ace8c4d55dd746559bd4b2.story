Nigel Worthington has resigned as manager of York City.

The club is one place above the League Two relegation zone after losing 3-1 at Newport County on Saturday and have won just once in the league all season.

The former Northern Ireland boss, 52, said: 'After Saturday's result and in the best interests of York City, I have made the difficult decision to leave.

'In recent weeks, performances have not been up to my high standards and I take full responsibility for this.'

Worthington took over at Bootham Crescent in March 2013 and guided the club away from relegation danger in their first season back in the Football League.

They finished seventh in the table last season after ending the campaign on a 17-match unbeaten run, but were knocked out of the play-offs by eventual winners Fleetwood.

After starting the new season with four successive draws, a win at Stevenage in September stretched their unbeaten run in regular league matches to a club record 23.

However, that remains their only league victory of the season to date and Saturday's loss left them above of the League Two drop-zone on goal difference only.

Worthington, who has also had spells in charge at Blackpool and Norwich, added: 'I have enjoyed a wonderful time at York City over the past 18 months.

'The fans have been fantastic throughout and I have appreciated their support. The experience would not have been the same without the friendship of all the staff at the club.'

'It has been an absolute pleasure and honour to have been manager of York City and I very much wish the club every success for the future.'
