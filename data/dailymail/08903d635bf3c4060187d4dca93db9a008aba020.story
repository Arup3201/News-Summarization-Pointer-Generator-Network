Luck plays a part in most discoveries of ancient artefacts and bones.

And one amateur palaeontologist has discovered a 75million-year-old giant turtle bone that matches another in a remote museum found over 160 years before.

The perfect match proves the existence of a giant sea turtle measuring 10ft (3 metres) long, making it the largest of its kind ever known.

The two partial limb fossils from the ancient sea turtle Atlantochelys mortoni fit together perfectly. The two halves were discovered at least 163 years apart, defying conventional wisdom that most fossils break down after weeks or months of surface exposure. The distal half (left) was discovered in 2012 and the proximal half (right) has been at Drexel University for more than a century

Amateur palaeontologist Gregory Harpel 
discovered the bone on an embankment upstream of his usual 
fossil-hunting haunt in Monmouth County, New Jersey, where he
 was searching for fossilised shark teeth.

The chemist from Oreland, Pennsylvania, said: ‘I picked it up and thought it was a rock at first – it was heavy’.

He realised that the fossil was more scientifically significant than shark teeth and took it to the experts at the New Jersey State Museum, to which he ultimately donated his find.

David Parris, the museum's curator of natural history and Jason Schein, his assistant, immediately recognised the fossil as a humerus – the large upper arm bone – from a turtle, but its shaft was broken so that only the distal end - the end nearest to the elbow - remained.

Dr Parris thought the fossil looked strangely familiar and joked to Dr Schein that perhaps it was the missing half of a different large, partial turtle limb housed in the collections at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia.

That bone also had a broken shaft, but only its proximal end, nearest to the shoulder, remained, so the coincidence was striking.

Based on the complete fossilised limb, experts have calculated the animal's overall size to be about 10ft from tip to tail, making it one of the largest sea turtles ever known. It may have resembled modern loggerhead turtles. In this illustration, it is depicted with the outline of a human diver to indicate scale. The turtle lived 70 to 75 million years ago

‘As soon as those two halves came together, like puzzle pieces, you knew it,’ said Dr Ted Daeschler, associate curator of vertebrate zoology and vice president for collections at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.

The discovery, which was made in 2012, linked scientists from both museums to their predecessors from the 19th century, according to the study in the forthcoming 2014 issue of the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

Dr Schein said: ‘I didn't think there was any chance in the world they [the two fossils] would actually fit.’

That's because the Academy's fossil was initially thought to be too old as palaeontologists expect that fossils found in exposed strata of rock will break down from exposure to the elements if they are not collected and preserved, at least within a few years, or a decade at the longest.

There was no reason to think a lost half of the same old bone would survive intact and exposed in a stream bed from at least the time of the old bone's first scientific description in 1849, they said.

The Academy's bone was also without a match of any kind, making a perfect match seem even more farfetched.

A 3-D scan of the two broken turtle limb fossils from Atlantocheyls mortoni shows a detailed view of their surfaces (pictured). Paleontologists from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University and from the New Jersey State Museum concluded that these two fossils came from the same animal, despite being discovered separately at least 163 years apart

It was originally named and described by 19th century naturalist Louis Agassiz as the first, or type specimen, of its genus and species, Atlantochelys mortoni.

It remained the only known fossil specimen from that genus and species until 2012 when Dr Schein carried the ‘new’ New Jersey fossil to the Academy in Philadelphia, bringing the two halves together.

‘Sure enough, you have two halves of the same bone, the same individual of this giant sea turtle,’ said Dr Daeschler.

‘One half was collected at least 162 years before the other half.’

Now scientists are revising their conventional wisdom to say that, sometimes, exposed fossils can survive longer than previously thought.

Dr Schein said: ‘The astounding confluence of events that had to have happened for this to be true is just unbelievable and probably completely unprecedented in palaeontology.’

The fully assembled humerus now gives the scientists more information about the massive sea turtle it came from as well.

The 70 to 75million-year-old species may have resembled modern loggerhead turtles (pictured), but was much larger than any sea turtle species alive today, at around 10ft long

With a complete limb, they have calculated that the animal was about 10ft from tip to tail, making it one of the largest sea turtles ever known.

The species may have resembled modern loggerhead turtles, but was much larger than any sea turtle species alive today.

Experts believe that the entire unbroken bone was originally embedded in sediment during the Cretaceous Period, 70 to 75 million years ago, when the turtle lived and died.

They think that sediments eroded and the bone fractured millions of years later during the Pleistocene or Holocene, before the bone pieces became embedded in sediments and protected from further deterioration for perhaps a few thousand more years until their discovery.

An amateur palaeontologist discovered the 'new' fossil, which is half of a humerus, in Monmouth County, New Jersey in 2012

It matched the other half of a fossil that was discovered 162 years previously and has been kept at Drexel University, in Philadelphia

Until 2012 the 'first' half of the fossil was the only type specimen of the genus and species - Atlantochelys mortoni - an ancient sea turtle

The turtle lived between 70 million and 75 million years ago and measured over 10ft long. It is thought to have resembled a modern loggerhead turtle
