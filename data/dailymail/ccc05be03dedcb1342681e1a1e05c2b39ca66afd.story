A police officer has collapsed and died while on a skiing holiday in Val d'Isère, France.

Richard Williams, 32, fell ill yesterday and was rushed to hospital where medics were unable to save him.

Described as ‘fighting fit’ by colleagues at Wolverhampton police, the cause of his death is currently unclear. However, he was not on the slopes when he became ill.

Pc Williams’s devastated family are believed to have flown out to the winter resort.

Chief Inspector Darren Walsh said: ‘Rich was a much-loved son, brother and a cherished colleague who will be sadly missed by his family and friends.

‘Our thoughts and prayers are with Rich's family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.’

Pc Williams was a response officer working with the local policing unit in Wolverhampton, where he lived.

An colleague patrolling the streets of the city yesterday afternoon, said: ‘Rich was a fighting fit bloke.  He looked after himself and was a true professional.

‘He was very active and some of the boys went out there to have a good skiing holiday.

‘They enjoyed those outdoor activities, you would never expect something like this to happen.

‘But from what I've been told he just collapsed and died suddenly - it is such a shock, especially at that age.

‘He's going to be missed massively because he was such a character around the station.

‘He had a huge personality and everyone is devastated.’

Val d'Isère is located in the Tarentaise Valley, in the Savoie department (Rhône-Alpes region) in southeastern France. It lies 5 km from the Italian border and is popular with British skiers.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We have been informed of the death of a British national in France on January 22 and consular staff are following up and providing assistance to the family at this difficult time.’
