Iain Duncan Smith has claimed voters are increasingly ‘uneasy’ at ‘extreme elements’ of Ukip as a row raged about the wisdom of a new campaign attacking the upstart party as racist.

The Work and Pensions Secretary, the standard bearer of the Tory Right in the Cabinet, suggested a slew of stories about extreme views of Ukip members and candidates would undermine the party’s credibility.

Mr Duncan Smith’s intervention came days after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also suggested Ukip has extremist elements.

A cross-party campaign branding the party racist will launch later this week - despite warnings from some senior Labour MPs that it could prove counterproductive.

Barbara Roche, Labour’s former immigration minister, who is behind the campaign, said: ‘Ukip’s campaign needs to be exposed for what it is, a racist campaign. The party is practising what is in effect a form of ‘Euracism’.

'They are deploying the same language and tactics used by openly racist parties like the BNP, but instead of targeting migrants from Africa and Asia they are targeting migrants from within the EU.’

Nadhim Zahawi, a Number 10 policy adviser, co-sponsors the Migration Matters Trust, chaired by Miss Roche, which is to coordinate the poster and social media campaign.

But Jacqui Smith, the former Labour Home Secretary, who warned there were no votes to be won by suggesting Ukip voters are ‘closet racists’.

Pointing to Gordon Brown’s attack on the Rochdale pensioner Gillian Duffy as ‘bigoted’ during the 2010 election campaign, she said: ‘Did we not learn from ‘bigotgate’ in 2010 that there are many potential and actual Labour voters who feel all the frustrations and insecurities expressed by the Ukip poster campaign? Telling them they are wrong - and worse, closet racists - is unlikely to win their support.’

Margaret Hodge, the senior Labour MP credited with killing off the BNP in her east London constituency, said she agreed with Miss Smith.

‘If you are going to rebuild trust in the traditional political parties, you have to really listen and understand the concerns of the public. If people feel they can’t get a house or can’t get their kid into a school, you have to understand that.

‘Scapegoating immigrants is not the answer but you have got to listen to people’s frustrations to be able to engage with them. Labelling them as racists is wrong and counterproductive,’ she said.

Mr Farage claimed there was an establishment plot by the main parties against Ukip, urging voters to ‘give the creeps a lesson’ at the ballot box.

His claims that the three main parties were ‘ganging up’ on Ukip, saying: ‘I think the British public will take this extremely badly. I believe they want and appreciate the new choices being offered to them by Ukip on issues like immigration control, and will certainly not appreciate being branded racist for doing so

‘I am really sorry that millions of people who have decided to vote Ukip next month now find themselves accused by the political establishment of supporting racism.’

‘The electorate is not in the mood to be intimidated by the political establishment and Messrs Cameron, Miliband and Clegg have just made another disastrous mistake. I call on all fair-minded British people to swing behind Ukip and teach these creeps a lesson they won’t forget in a hurry.’

The major parties are rattled by Ukip's strong performance in opinion polls

Mr Duncan Smith said the revelations about Ukip and its members ‘would take some time to seep through’ but said polling showed voters - particularly those who have previously voted Conservative - were alarmed by Ukip’s association with the views of the far-Right BNP.

Addressing young Conservative activists in remarks leaked to the website breitbart.com, Mr Duncan Smith said there was a ‘whiff of extremism coming through’, adding: ‘I know from polling that voters who have voted Conservative feel very uneasy with the association of UKIP close to what I call some quite extreme elements.

‘This kind of stuff worries them but it takes some time to seep through. We know genuinely the last thing conservatives want to be associated with is anything that touches on the BNP.

‘They genuinely don’t like the BNP and the suggestions that UKIP may be in any way close to that is a problem, so just telling them about the Government that is rational, reasonable and getting the job done is quite important.’

But Mr Duncan Smith warned that in terms of the European Parliament elections next month, which people would use as a ‘protest vote’, Ukip’s leader Nigel Farage could only profit from controversy.

‘No matter what publicity he gets, the better it is for him. The more he’s in the public eye the more he gains because he’s not us. He’s not Conservative, he’s not Labour, he’s not Lib Dem,’ he said.
