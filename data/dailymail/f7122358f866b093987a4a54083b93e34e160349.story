A dangerous strain of E.coli has led to at least two children needing dialysis in hospital – and left angry parents asking why authorities failed to sound the alert early enough.

The rare form of the bacteria, apparently originating in Dorset, has struck 11 people, including five children, with seven developing kidney problems which could be permanent.

One three-year-old girl, from Blandford in the county, is battling the infection in hospital after being struck down last week.

Freddy Osborne, one, was rushed to hospital with E. coli after eating at Frankie & Benny's in Castlepoint, Bournemouth - but the restaurant has been given the all clear

Several victims were associated with a children’s nursery. Yet while the outbreak began in July, Public Health England (PHE) only began raising any alarm this week.

It is yet to identify the source of the potentially fatal infection of E.coli 055 but has ruled out a Bournemouth branch of restaurant chain Frankie and Benny’s where three victims dined in two separate groups before being struck down.

Yesterday, PHE contacted the families of all the victims asking relatives to give blood tests in an attempt to establish the origin of the outbreak.

One of those who needed dialysis is Freddy Osborne, now 21 months. 

Isaac Mortlock, three, also fell ill with E. coli after eating at the same Frankie & Benny's restaurant, which has been cleared of any blame by investigators

Isaac's mother Gabrielle Archer (pictured) also feared her son could die after finding him fitting in the middle of the night

He spent four weeks in Southampton General Hospital, much of it in intensive care, and required multiple blood transfusions.

He was at one stage left blind for ten days and had to be put into a coma for six days because it was dangerous for him to try to breathe. 

Although Freddy survived the ordeal, he was left blind for 10 days and his kidneys may never work properly again

Eventually he was diagnosed with the E.coli 055 strain, although all the diagnoses took a long time because the strain has never been found since records began in 1994.

Freddy’s mother Charlotte Fudge, 25, from Bournemouth, said: ‘The whole family thought he was going to die. 

He was totally traumatised and went through hell. It is ridiculous Public Health England didn’t warn people what was going on and work harder to find the source.’

Gabrielle Archer’s son Isaac, three, was in the same hospital as Freddy, also needing dialysis and spending time in intensive care. 

He is now home after nine weeks in two hospitals but is still on a nasal drip and has permanently damaged kidneys. The family fear he may be in need of a kidney transplant.

Miss Archer, 26, from Bournemouth, said: ‘The day after Isaac’s birthday in July he suddenly got very ill. First he was sick. Then he began passing blood.

‘At first doctors told us it was probably gastroenteritis. It was only when he started leaking blood permanently they said they’d have to admit him to hospital. 

Then he got violently sick – and an X-ray and scan showed his kidneys were affected and he had to go on dialysis. He had to be switched to another hospital in Southampton and stay there for five weeks.

‘He had fits in the middle of one night as well, his eyes were rolling, I thought he was dying, and I was screaming ‘‘Won’t someone help my baby?” He was unrecognisable.’

Freddy, now two, was the first to pick up the rare strain of E. coli that has hospitalised 11 people in Dorset since July

Isaac’s aunt, Jessica Archer, was then struck down by the same strain of E.coli and was hospitalised.

Miss Archer is angry that PHE did not start publicising the outbreak until this week.

She said: ‘I’m devastated that other children are now suffering – and feel that had Public Health England taken Isaac’s case more seriously in the first place, and put out more warnings, fewer people could have been affected.’

A spokesman for PHE said that the people affected by the strain had been struck over a lengthy period, and that while all had passed through Dorset, not all were from there, so it took some time to pull the facts together.

She said: ‘All those affected and their close contacts are being followed up and further investigations are taking place to determine the likely source.’

Cleared: Three people who have fallen ill with E. coli ate at Frankie & Benny's before they were hospitalised, but the restaurant has been given a clean bill of health

Escherichia coli or E.coli, is a group of bacteria that live in the intestines of animals and humans. Many strains are harmless, but some can cause serious health problems.

About 35,000 people are struck down by different forms of E.coli infection every year. Many cases are mild, such as urinary tract infections, but 1,000 a year are hit by E.coli food poisoning which can be very serious, particularly to children and the elderly.

The most common serious E.coli strain in Britain is O157. Symptoms include severe diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever. Infections can cause serious complications such as potentially fatal kidney problems or brain damage.

The bug releases toxins which can affect blood vessels – leading to fits and attacking the kidneys. It may also harm the heart.

Infection is spread by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacteria, or through contact with infected people or farm animals.

A severe outbreak at a petting farm in Surrey affected 76 young children in 2009, ten of them suffering long-term effects.

The UK’s largest E.coli food poisoning outbreak killed 21 people in Lanarkshire in 1996.
