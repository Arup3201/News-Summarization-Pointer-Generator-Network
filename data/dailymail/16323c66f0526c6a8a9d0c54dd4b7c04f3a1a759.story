Troubled AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd was taken to court by police on Thursday after breaching his bail conditions in relation to the charges against him of threatening to kill and drug possession.

Rudd was filmed being handcuffed by police next to a black sports car by the side of Cameron Road, on the North Island of New Zealand and was then taken to the local station.

However, his lawyer Paul Mabey told Daily Mail Australia that Rudd is now back out on bail.

‘He’s appeared on a breach of bail by speaking to a witness and has been rebailed. He’s been to court and gone home,’ Mr Mabey said.

No charges were made against Rudd on Thursday.

The Bay of Plenty Times reported his other lawyer Craig Tuck told Judge Paul Geoghegan his client acknowledged that he had breached the condition by having contact with a police witnesses at a local shop.

Rudd is due back in court on February 10 and now has a further bail condition - he must not take illegal drugs. 

In November, Rudd was charged with attempting to procure a murder.

That charge was dropped a day later, but the drummer has entered not guilty pleas on charges of threatening to kill, possessing cannabis and possessing methamphetamine.

The only Australian-born member of AC/DC, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of fame in 2003 with other members of the band.

He had moved to New Zealand in 1983 after he was told to leave the group, but he rejoined them in 1994.

Settling in Tauranga, he opened a restaurant where staff later took a case to the Employment Relations Authority.

After appearing in court recently to answer charges of threatening to kill and drug possession he jumped onto the back of a minder after leaving the building and took a piggy-back ride along the pavement.

His bizarre behaviour raised eyebrows.
