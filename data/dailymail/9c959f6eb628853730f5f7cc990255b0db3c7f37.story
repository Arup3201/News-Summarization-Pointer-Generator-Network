Former world heavyweight champion Ken Norton, who broke Muhammad Ali’s jaw when they fought in 1973, has died at the age of 70.

Norton, who passed away from heart failure at a Las Vegas nursing home, had been in poor health after a series of strokes.

The former US marine, who was only the second man to ever beat Ali, had an unconventional boxing style that saw him rise through the ranks to battle some of the era’s greatest fighters, including George Foreman, Joe Frazier and Larry Holmes.

His
 famous victory over Ali, which came at the height of the champion’s 
dominance of the sport, was followed by two further bouts, becoming one 
of the great rivalries in boxing history. Norton lost both rematches, 
but only by the slimmest of margins each time.

Norton’s
 unorthodox style – coming in close and jabbing from below rather than 
above, and using a cross-armed defence – took many of his opponents by 
surprise. He was eventually crowned the World Boxing Council’s champion 
in 1977, but only because the holder, Leon Spinks, decided to fight Ali 
instead of facing Norton, who was the mandatory challenger.

He
 lost his title by just one point to Larry Holmes in a famously bruising
 15-round heavyweight title fight in 1978, which has gone down as one of
 the greatest bouts in boxing history.

The
 defeat effectively ended Norton’s career and he switched to acting, 
appearing in some 20 films and episodes of the TV series Knight Rider 
and The A-Team.

He was almost killed in a car crash in 1986 and wore a fedora to hide the scars.

Mike
 Tyson, who visited Norton in hospital before his death, said: ‘Ken 
Norton was always nice to me even when I was just an amateur fighter. He
 always treated me like I was somebody. Remarkable man.’

Ali's former business manager Gene Kilroy said Norton had been in poor health for the last several years after suffering a series of strokes.

'He's been fighting the battle for two years,' he said. 'I'm sure he's in heaven now with all the great fighters. I'd like to hear that conversation.'

Kilroy also revealed Ali and Norton never had any animosity toward each other and became good friends over the years. Still, Norton always thought he had won all three fights.

His son Ken Norton Jr was a linebacker for 13 years in the NFL, playing for Dallas and San Francisco, and coaches the position for the Seahawks. He and his father were estranged for a time in the 1990s before finally reconciling.

Norton always gave his father credit for his career, saying he learned how to train hard by watching him go for early morning runs when he was a child.

'It's been noted that my father and I are on speaking terms and everything's back together now,' Norton Jr. said in 1995. 'It's part of what I do. No matter what I do, I can't get away from boxing.'

Norton, was born on August 9, 1943, in Jacksonville, Illinois, started boxing when he was in the US marines, and began his pro career after his release from duty in 1967.

He lost only once in his early fights but had fought few fighters of any note when he was selected to meet Ali.

At the time, Ali was campaigning to try to win back the heavyweight crown he lost to Joe Frazier in 1973.

After that bruising first bout, they faced off two more times, including the final fight at Yankee Stadium on a night when police were on strike and many in the crowd feared for their safety. The fight went 15 rounds and Ali won a decision.

Norton was badly injured in a near fatal car accident in 1986. He recovered but never regained his full physical mobility.

'The
 doctors said I would never walk or talk,' Norton said at an autograph 
session in 2011 in Las Vegas, lifting his trademark fedora to show long 
surgical scars on his bald head.

Kilroy said Norton was visited at the hospital by former fighters, including Tyson, Earnie Shavers and Thomas Hearns.

Norton fought only five more times after losing his title to Holmes. His final fight came November 5, 1981, when he was knocked out in the first round by Gerry Cooney at Madison Square Garden.
