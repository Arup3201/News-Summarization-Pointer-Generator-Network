Claudia Boerner: She had just appeared on a TV cooking show in Germany called The Perfect Dinner

A model who appeared on a TV  cooking show killed herself after being taunted by internet trolls.

Claudia Boerner was found dead after taking part in The Perfect  Dinner, which is similar to Channel  4’s Come Dine With Me.

Although it is unclear how the 32-year-old died, it is understood she suffered a barrage of abuse on email and social media following her appearance on the show.

Critics accused her of being an attention
 seeker, claimed that she had showed off for the cameras and made nasty 
comments about her ‘fake boobs’ and appearance. 

Neighbours reported a 
strong smell of gas in the hall outside the flat where Miss Boerner 
lived in Vellmar, Germany.

Her Facebook page displays Ms Boerner's modelling photos and says she is in a relationship.

It also says she worked as an office assistant as well as modelling.

Tragic: Claudia Boerner was found dead in her apartment in Vellmar, Germany, after taking part cooking competition, The Perfect Dinner. The show has the same format as Britain's popular Come Dine With Me

Corinna Teuner - a spokeswoman for Vox, the station that made the show - said: 'We don't know if internet mobbing played a definite role in this case. We send our sympathy to the friends and family of the candidate.'

A message on the programme's website 
added: 'This week we received the sad news that Claudia, who was seen in
 the past week at The Perfect Dinner has died.

She struck us as a friendly, open-minded young woman. We were all surprised and shocked by the news.'

Friendly and open-minded: Shocked friends paid tribute to Ms Boerner, who became upset at nasty comments about her appearance

In the show competitors all cook for each other over a series of evenings and then give their score based on the meal. 

Ms Boerner was up against two women and two men when she took part in the show.
