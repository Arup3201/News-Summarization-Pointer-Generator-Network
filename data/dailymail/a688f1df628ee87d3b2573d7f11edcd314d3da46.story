David Cameron has backed Scottish shipbuilding with an £859million investment in the next generation of Royal Navy frigates to be built on the River Clyde.

The Prime Minister said the money will be spent on developing the Type 26 warship and sustain 1,700 jobs across the country. 

The ship will replace Type 23s, with around 13 expected to be built by BAE Systems for service in the early 2020s.

Around 600 jobs will be safeguarded in Scotland, with other BAE Systems sites and supply chain firms also benefiting in areas including Derbyshire, West Yorkshire, Manchester, Cheshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire and Hampshire.

During a visit to the Govan shipyard in Glasgow, Mr Cameron said: 'This is a substantial investment in our shipbuilding industry, safeguarding the jobs of 600 workers in Scotland and many more across the UK. 

'Investing in these warships will ensure we continue to keep our country safe, at home and abroad.

'As part of our long-term economic plan, we're not just building the most advanced modern warships in the world - we are building the careers of many young people with apprenticeships that will set them up for life.'

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon added the announcement is a 'clear vote of confidence in British industry'.

He added it forms part of the government's commitment to invest more than £160billion in equipment and equipment support over the next decade.

He said: 'As a result, our military will have some of the most impressive and technologically-advanced capabilities in the world, from the aircraft carriers and the F-35 Lightning II fighter jets to the Type 45 destroyers, Scout armoured vehicles, the A400M and the Astute Class submarines.'

BAE Systems chief executive Ian King said: 'We have a long and proud heritage of delivering complex warships in the UK and today's announcement is a significant endorsement of the Government's commitment to sustain this important national capability.

'We are committed to working with the Government, the Ministry of Defence and our partners in the maritime supply chain to ensure the Royal Navy has the capability it needs to protect national interests, while ensuring the best value for money for UK taxpayers.

'Through the Type 26 programme, we are transforming the way we design and manufacture naval ships with innovative new technologies, leading-edge processes and modern infrastructure. 

'New ways of working ensure we can continue to deliver the highest quality equipment at the lowest possible cost and compete effectively for future UK and international orders.'

The first Type 26 is due to enter service as soon as possible after 2020 and will remain in service until 2060.

The development contract is expected to support around 30 companies in the supply chain.

David Hulse, national officer of the GMB union, welcomed the 'very good news' as it secures the future of shipyards along the River Clyde.

He said: 'This announcement is very good news in that it secures the future of the Clydeside shipyards and the skilled workforce and will enable the company to provide a substantial number of much-needed apprenticeships.

'The uncertain international climate calls into question the Tory plans for further cuts in defence spending in the next parliament. 

'These will impact on the capacity of the Army, the Navy and the RAF at a time when the UK needs to be able to deal with all threats to national security. The skilled shipyard and defence workforce are as much on the front line as the forces in uniform.

'During the election campaign the electorate need to question Tory spending plans where the combined annual budget of non-protected departments would have to come down by a third in real terms. 

'A cut of one third in defence spending is simply not on and these plans must be changed.'

Today's announcement marked the culmination of an argument that raged during the independence referendum over the future of shipbuilding in Scotland. 

The Clyde shipyards had been earmarked for the lucrative contract to build Type 26 frigates, but the decision would be confirmed after the vote in September.

Former First Minister Alex Salmond reassured Yes voters that shipbuilding would continue on the Clyde if Scotland became independent. 

But the No campaign - supported by the UK government, Ministry of Defence, Royal Navy and BAE (who all said that it would not and could not) - argued the contract would be lost if Scotland left the UK. 

Asked to guarantee the long-term future of shipbuilding, Mr Salmond told the Scottish Trades Union Congress: 'The Royal Navy will continue to order ships from Scottish yards, based on that these are the best places to produce these vessels.'

But his remarks in April last year coincided with a speech by then UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond in Glasgow - who warned that thousands of jobs would be at risk if Scotland became independent.

Ian King, chief executive of BAE, also indicated, in a letter submitted to the chairman of the Scottish Affairs Committee Ian Davidson, that shipyards on the Clyde would likely have to close if Scotland voted for independence. 

Mr Davidson agreed, along with the shipbuilding industry and the MoD, that 'the only guarantee for the future of shipbuilding on the Clyde is for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.'

This is because companies based in an independent Scottish state would no longer be eligible for contracts that the UK chose to place or compete domestically for national security reasons due to Article 346 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union. 

The UK has not had a complex warship built outside of the country since the Second World War.

But Mr Salmond and then Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon drew criticism from the industry and trade unions for continuing to suggest Britain's new warships would be built in Scotland if the nationalist campaign was successful as Ministry of Defence sources insisted it would not happen.

Henry Wilson, Unite staff convener at BAE Systems, said unions knew that UK defence contracts would not be awarded to a foreign country.  

Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also argued Scotland would find it 'difficult' to win UK government shipbuilding contracts if the country votes for independence.

The SNP accused him of trying to blackmail Scots into voting No.

Nationalists claimed the Clyde was the only place left to build warships following BAE's decision to end shipbuilding in Portsmouth.

Nicola Sturgeon dismissed suggestions that a Yes vote would put future warship orders in doubt, claiming that the Clyde would be the 'best and only place' to build the ships.

In November 2013, she said: 'The current UK government has just agreed with BAE Systems that Portsmouth will cease building ships in 2014, and that Glasgow is 'the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships'. That will remain true, whether there is a 'Yes' next year or not.'
