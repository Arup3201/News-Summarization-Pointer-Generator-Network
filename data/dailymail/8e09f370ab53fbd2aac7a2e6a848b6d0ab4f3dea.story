The ailing, scandal-hit king of Spain announced his abdication yesterday, saying it was time to hand over to a younger generation.

Juan Carlos, 76, who has reigned for nearly 40 years, is the third European monarch to abdicate in just over a year.

His surprise decision, on the 61st anniversary of Elizabeth II’s coronation, will inevitably spark speculation about the future of the UK monarchy.

Stepping down: Spanish King Juan Carlos I yesterday announced he would abdicate in favour of his son Prince Felipe

However, the Queen, 88, has always made clear that she will stand by her promise to serve as Britain’s sovereign for the rest of her life.

Juan Carlos – who has undergone five operations in two years – is stepping down in favour of his son, Crown Prince Felipe.

A source at the royal palace in Madrid said the king was abdicating for political reasons, rather than due to failing health, as his country struggles with its worst economic crisis in memory.

In a television address, Juan Carlos said: ‘I have decided to end my reign and abdicate the crown of Spain. A new generation is quite rightly demanding to take the lead role.’

His abdication follows that of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, who handed the throne to her son Prince Willem-Alexander in April last year after 33 years, and King Albert II of Belgium, who stepped down last summer. But experts were quick to stress that events in Spain would have no bearing on Britain.

Royal historian Hugo Vickers said that while Juan Carlos is in poor health and has faced a slump in his popularity the Queen is ‘firing on all cylinders’. ‘The Queen is not likely to abdicate,’ he said.

‘We know from various biographies that she was pretty irritated when Queen Juliana of the Netherlands [Beatrix’s mother] abdicated in the 1980s because monarchs shouldn’t abdicate.’

Juan Carlos earned a place in Spanish hearts when he took the crown in 1975.

He became constitutional monarch two days after the death of General Franco, helping to smooth the transition from hardline dictatorship to modern democracy.

In recent years, however, his popularity has nosedived amid accusations he is increasingly out of touch with his people.

In 2012, he was widely criticised for a secret hunting trip to Botswana – where he fell and broke his hip while shooting elephant.

His lavish holiday contrasted sharply with the news back at home that one in four Spanish workers was jobless.

The ill-fated trip also sparked speculation about the nature of his relationship with Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, the German-born aristocrat 28 years his junior who accompanied him.

It has long been reported that Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, his wife of more than 50 years, lead separate lives.

The king’s younger daughter, Princess Cristina, has been tainted by a corruption scandal involving her husband.

The princess has been summoned to answer allegations of money laundering and tax evasion and it is strongly suspected that charges will be brought.

Fortunately Juan Carlos’s eldest son, who will become Felipe VI, still enjoys good poll ratings. The 46-year-old is married to glamorous former television newsreader Letizia Ortiz, with whom he has daughters Leonor and Sofia.

King Juan Carlos addresses the nation following his abdication at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid.

Letizia is both a commoner and a divorcee – indeed she will become the first divorced woman to become a queen of Spain – but has proved popular with Spaniards for her ‘modern approach’ to royal life.

rince Felipe is also lauded for his understated lifestyle, although he still has an uphill task convincing his countrymen there is a need for a monarchy.

Juan Carlos insisted yesterday that his son ‘embodies stability’ and will be a good servant of Spain.‘He has the maturity, the preparation and the sense of responsibility required to assume the throne,’ he said.

The country does not have a law regulating abdication and succession.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will today chair an emergency meeting of ministers to set out the steps for Prince Felipe to take over. Announcing news of the abdication yesterday, Mr Rajoy said: ‘I’m convinced this is the best moment for change.’

David Cameron hailed Juan Carlos as ‘a great friend to the United Kingdom’.

The Prime Minister also wrote to Mr Rajoy to pay tribute to the king. Asked whether there was merit in monarchs abdicating towards the end of their reign, Downing Street insisted Mr Cameron hoped the Queen would remain on the throne.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The PM wishes her the longest and happiest of reigns.’
