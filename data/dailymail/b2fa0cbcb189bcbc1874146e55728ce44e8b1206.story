The New Zealand businesswoman who said she fell prey to an alleged group sex attack in Sydney after meeting a man on the dating app, Tinder, has retracted her statement.

Police are no longer investigating the incident. They would not comment on why the woman withdrew her allegations. 

The 28-year-old, who was visiting Sydney on a business trip, had alleged she met up a with a man of Maori or Pacific Islander appearance at a restaurant in the Kings Cross nightclub district.

Police warned that Tinder-users should take extra caution when meeting people from online as they are of 'sexual predators out there who use modern technology to find potential victims'

This comes after a New Zealand woman met up with a man at Kings Cross, Sydney's inner city, on Saturday night after speaking to him through mobile dating app Tinder

The pair then headed to a bar in Martin Place, it was claimed, and soon after she began to feel dizzy and numb. 

The woman said she woke up at a property in Botany on Sunday, unaware of where she was. 

She later told colleagues and reported the incident to a hospital, and then police, on Monday.

Sex Crime Squad investigators believed at least three men were involved with the incident. 

But as of Thursday, they had not identified any suspects. 

Police said yesterday the victim was 'struggling'.

'It's a very emotional time for her,' Detective Inspector Michael Haddow told reporters. 

'A very difficult incident, the whole matter.'

The woman has since returned to New Zealand and was being supported by family.

The incident provoked police into issuing a warning to online daters to be cautious when meeting strangers for the first time.

Inspector Haddow told reporters a persona on a dating app may differ from their real life identity.   

'The message is not to not use sites like this, but ... to do so with a degree of caution,' he said.

He further advised that those thinking of meeting someone from dating websites or apps should bring a friend on the date.

'We strongly advise people that if they decide to meet a person they have been introduced to via the internet, then ensure the meeting is in a public place and take a friend along with you.'

'Having a friend there ensures that one of you can always keep an eye on your drink, and you have someone to turn to who can help you out should you feel threatened or uncomfortable.'

'If it's not possible to bring a friend with you, then, at the very least, stay in regular contact with a family member or friend, keeping them abreast of how the night is going and where you may be heading to,' the inspector said. 

Last month a New Zealand tourist Warrienna Wright, 26, fell to her death from a Gold Coast apartment balcony hours after meeting a man she matched with on Tinder.

Gable Tostee, a 28-year-old carpet layer, has been charged with Ms Wright's murder.

There's been no comment from the dating app, Tinder, as yet. 

Police said they will not provide any further comment.
