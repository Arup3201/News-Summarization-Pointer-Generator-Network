The spurned mother of Francois Hollande’s four children is being tipped to run against him for the French presidency in 2017.

Segolene Royal, herself a leading Socialist politician, was furious when Mr Hollande left her for magazine journalist Valerie Trierweiler following a long secret affair.

The two women detest each other, but Ms Royal is particularly angry that she was left out of Mr Hollande’s government when he came to power last year.

Bitter split: Francois Hollande, pictured left with his new partner Valerie Trierweiler, is said to be facing a challenge for the presidency from his ex-partner and mother of his four children Segolene Royal

In recent weeks, she has started criticising his administration – leading commentators to believe that she will stand against Mr Hollande when he bids for a second term in 2017.

‘There is no doubt that Segolene wants to be France’s first female president, and she will stop at nothing to achieve that ambition,’ said a Socialist Party source.

‘Segolene is all over the media at the moment, attacking Mr Hollande, and making clear that she means business.’

Ms Royal, 59, has appeared on TV constantly over the past few days, attacking Mr Hollande’s failing economic policies, and refusing to rule out a bid for power in four years’ time.

Asked if she was ready for government, Ms Royal said: ‘If the occasion arises, why not? If it doesn’t arise, I don’t need that to be useful.’

She also said Mr Hollande’s pace of reform was ‘too slow’, saying: ‘It should go much more quickly.’

Lovers turned rivals: Francois Hollande and Segolene Royal, pictured together left, became partners in the late 1970s and had four children. They split in 2007 after he had an affair and leading socialist politician Ms Royal, pictured left, is now tipped to challenge him for the presidency

Ms Royal was the Socialist candidate for the presidency in 2007, but was beaten by the conservative Nicolas Sarkozy.

The notoriously hen-pecked Mr Hollande is clearly unsure how to deal with his ex-girlfriend.

He tried to pacify Ms Royal by making her vice-chairman of the national Public Investment Bank, but this is not proving enough for her.

If he gives Ms Royal a cabinet job during an expected summer reshuffle it will infuriate Ms Trierweiler. If he ignores her she is likely to become even more of a political rival.

‘Segolene is angry,’ said political commentator Caroline Roux. ‘She has erupted in the public debate. She remains unpredictable and sure of her destiny.’

Ms Trierweiler caused outrage last year when she tweeted support for a rival of Ms Royal in a parliamentary election - one which Ms Royal went on to lose.

Ms Royal has also never forgiven her love rival for conducting her affair with Mr Hollande behind her back.

In a recent TV interview to publish a new book, Ms Royal was asked if she had forgiven Ms Trierweiler.

Ms Royal replied: 'In life, when you are betrayed, when someone hurts you - what is more, gratuitously - when it's ferocious, when it's violent, if you want to survive you have to forgive.

'At the end of the day, they hurt themselves, you know, nasty and aggressive people.'
