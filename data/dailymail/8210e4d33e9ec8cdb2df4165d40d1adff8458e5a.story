An Australian teenager who lost contact with family and friends when Cyclone Pam struck Vanuatu last week, has now been found.  

18-year-old Zoe Marshall was spotted by Australian search helicopters on Pentecost Island this morning and was able to speak to her relieved family by phone. 

Her father, Rob Marshall, says she is 'safe and well' even though helicopters were unable to lift her and fellow volunteer, New Zealander Courtney Tilby, to safety because they were too close to a cliff. 

Zoe Marshall (pictured on the day she left for Vanuatu) has been found safe and well by rescue helicopters in Vanuatu. Zoe was volunteering for the charity Latitude near Namaram, on the island of Pentecost, when Cyclone Pam struck the islands

Rescue helicopters reportedly dropped a note to Ms Marshall and Ms Tilby with instructions on where to walk to safer ground so that they could be reached by rescuers today the Canberra Times reports.  

Zoe's father Rob tweeted this morning  that his daughter was seen 'smiling and waving' by the helicopter. Using the hashtag #proudolddad he passed on one of the messages the family  received from Zoe today.

'I really want to go back; I love my family and the kids. There's a lot to do out there,' she wrote

Ms Marshall was one of nineteen volunteer teachers who were unaccounted for after the category five cyclone swept through Vanuatu on March 13. Five of the volunteers were evacuated by Australian consular officials on Thursday and another eight people are expected to be rescued today, the Department of Foreign Affairs says. 

Until today, the family in Canberra hadn't heard from their daughter since  the storm struck the islands.

'I love you more than most things': This was the last text message Alison Abernethy received from her daughter, Zoe Marshall, before the cyclone struck Vanuatu last week 

As the cyclone approached, the aspiring engineering student had told her parents in a text message that the village was well-prepared and that it 'should be fine'.

'Sorry for the early text but don't know when phone will work. We've got cat 5 warning. Should hit us tonight. Should be all good,' she said.  

She said a rat had chewed part of her sandal and, to her parents' amusement, she pledged to fill the rat's nest with rocks after the storm passed.   

Zoe, who her mother Alison Abernethy describes as a teenager with 'a strong social conscience,' was donating her time to young people on the island, living in a village with 'limited electricity, no running water and pit toilets.

Ms Abernethy told Daily Mail Australia her daughter would have tried to contact them if she could.

'She would have known that we're really worried about her,' Ms Abernethy had said, but it didn't help that she was staying in an 'incredibly remote' location.  

'If you find her, just hand her a SatPhone or take a photo so that we know she's alive,' her mother had written in a blog post titled 'Where's my girl?' on Wednesday.
