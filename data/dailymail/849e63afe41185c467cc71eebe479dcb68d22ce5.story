A pocket-sized dog weighing just 170 grams and standing just five centimetres tall is believed to be the smallest puppy in the country.

Belle, the miniature Yorkshire Terrier, who is just seven weeks old, lives in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, with her owner Karenza Cruse.

The pooch was named after the Tinker Bell fairy character from Peter Pan due to her small stature and feisty character. She was the only survivor out of a litter of four.

Small but perfectly formed: Belle, the cute miniature Yorkshire Terrier puppy,  is just five centimetres tall

Unfortunately the puppy's mother rejected her diminutive offspring shortly after birth, so Ms Cruse subsequently decided to hand-rear Belle. 

Ms Cruse said: 'In order to feed her every two hours like I have been at night time I've been sleeping on the sofa for the past few weeks so that it's easier for me to get up.'

Minuscule moggy: Belle weighs just 170 grams and is so small she has no trouble fitting into a tea cup

High heels: Belle's owner Karenza Cruse places the puppy beside her feet to demonstrate how small she is

'She sleeps in a playpen next to me and I either set an alarm or she has actually started to wake me up when she wants feeding.'

Ms Cruse says seven week-old Belle  could be the smallest puppy in the world for a puppy of her age.

The pet owner took the canine to a specialist vet in Newmarket recently, who confirmed that the puppy was the smallest  they had ever seen.

Dedication: Ms Cruse says she has to feed Belle every two hours, so she now sleeps on the sofa
