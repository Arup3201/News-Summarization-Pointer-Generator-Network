Anderson has become the latest sportsperson of the ever-growing list to participate in the Ice Bucket challenge.

The Manchester United midfielder was nominated by Brazilian compatriot Rafael da Silva, and wasted no time in doing the challenge.

After completing it he nominated team-mates Marouane Fellaini and Shinji Kagawa as well as former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. It's safe to say that particular nomination could well have landed him in serious hot water!

Despite an uncertain future at Manchester United, Anderson was all smiles as he took part in the challenge. 

The Brazilian is one of a host of United players made available for transfer by Louis van Gaal this summer.

The likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and David Beckham are just a couple of the other names in football who have participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge - which has trended worldwide on Twitter.
