A couple who let their toddler urinate in the middle of a busy Hong Kong street have sparked a huge debate about acceptable standards of behaviour in Chinese society.

The woman was filmed holding a nappy under her two-year-old daughter as she relieved herself in the middle of Mong Kok, one of the world’s busiest shopping districts, last Tuesday.

A row quickly erupted after the toddler’s parents tried to make off with the memory card from the camera of a young man who filmed the incident.

A Chinese mother allowed her toddler to urinate on a busy Hong Kong street as the lines for the public toilet were too long

Another passser-by recorded the altercation that ensued and the footage has gone viral with more than a million people viewing the video on social media site Weibo.

Much of the furore centres around the perceived gap between standards of social behaviour in mainland China and on the former British colony of Hong Kong.

It is illegal to let a child relieve themselves in the street in Hong Kong and doing so can result in a HK$2000 fine. However, the practice is relatively common in mainland China. 

The incident in Mong Kok last week occurred because there was a long line for a public toilet and the child could not wait, according to the Want China Times.

Onlookers surrounded the family to take pictures and then blocked their path as they tried to flee with the child and the pram.

The Chinese couple got into a physical altercation as they tried to take the memory card from the camera of the young man taking photos of their daughter  

‘The child was going to pee in her pants, what do you want me do?’ the mother can be heard telling onlookers in the video.

She was arrested for allegedly slapping one of the locals across the face and ramming another with the pram.

The row came to light after a Hong Kong reporter, Luqiu Luwei, posted the details on her blog.

An anonymous user of China’s popular online forum, Tianya.cn, has now escalated tensions by calling on mainland parents to bring their children to Hong Kong this week and let them urinate in the streets in protest.

‘Bring children to Hong Kong and let them urinate in Hong Kong’s streets. Let’s see who will come and take photos. They will see it as natural after they have been familiarised with the act,’ user Haijiao No68 posted, according to the South China Morning Post.

Since being posted online, the video and images of the toddler has drawn more than one million comments on Weibo social media alone. 

‘Why don't the couple let the child wear the diaper as a precaution in the first place?’ Ivan lam posted on Weibo.

‘They could talk to the people in the line to let them use the bathroom first or let the child pee inside the bathroom instead of on the street.’

But Chinese citizens weighing in on the debate have hit back at the treatment of the couple and child.

‘The man had no right to take pictures of a little girl peeing and violate her privacy,’ Weibo user youyouyu wrote.
