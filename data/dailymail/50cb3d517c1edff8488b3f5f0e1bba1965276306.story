A woman who created a popular app promoting an alternative lifestyle after she was diagnosed with cancer has not donated the funds raised through sales of the app to charity as promised, it has been revealed.

Belle Gibson, 26, is the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry recipe and health app, which she created after she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.

She shunned traditional treatments to combat her cancer and instead opted for a wholefood and holistic approach after trialing chemotherapy and other modern medical procedures.

However despite publicising that large amounts of the profits from her app were going to charity, the money was never handed over according to Fairfax Media.

Belle Gibson, 26, the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry recipe and health app, publicly said $300,000 in profits would go to charity, but they never did

The 26-year-old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business' profits were being donated to charity, last year claiming that $300,000 had been donated

The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app

The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app.

At least five charities who purportedly had money raised for them through a number of campaigns run by Ms Gibson never saw any funds.

The app, which has been downloaded over 300,000 times, proved so popular she was flown out to Silicone Valley last year where she was told her app was to be included on the Apple Watch.

The 26-year-old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business' profits were being donated to charity, last year claiming that $300,000 had been donated.

However Ms Gibson told Fairfax Media this week that those donations had never been made, citing disappointing app sales and miscalculated profit margins.

Neither Melbourne’s Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and One Girl - who were donated $1000 after questions were raised - received any money from Ms Gibson and the former were not even aware money was being raised in their name.

She has also released a cookbook version of the creations following the success of the app

There have been revelations that The Whole Pantry business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises

Apparently only $7000 had reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated. 

There were also revelations that the business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises, which could draw huge fines and potential jail time. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted The Whole Pantry for comment and while they could not be reached at the time of publishing, they had earlier posted a lengthy response on social media addressing claims made in the original article. 

In the post to their Facebook page the company clarified they were a 'for-profit' company to the surprise of many of their followers, and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry.

'We have, like all start ups, struggled with managing all facets of a new business, biting off more than we could chew, juggling internal and external priorities with little staff. 

'We have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external Business Manager and Accounts team, an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses.

Last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new Apple Watch

Apparently only $7000 of a projected $300,000 has reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated

'They have been working over our finances for the last five months, and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight. We were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward,' the post read in part.

'Our books are taking longer to bring up to date than anticipated. TWP forecasted income in October 2014 which was not fulfilled, creating cash-flow issues and unforeseen delays on finalising three discussed charitable donations,' another section of the post read. 

Also citing 'cash flow issues' as Ms Gibson did when explaining the business model and why charities had received no donations, the lengthy response garnered harsh criticism from commenters.

'Appalling - your organisation not the media. Money for charity doesn't go into "cash flow" - that is beyond unethical, surely it's illegal?', one angry subscriber posted.

'You have skipped the entire point in your very long and wordy response. YOU took money from people who GAVE you the money believing it would go to said charities, you FAILED to forward on the money,' another poster wrote. 

'... That my friends is dishonesty / theft in the highest degree and takes advantage of peoples good natures. SHAME on you,' the comment continued.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted The Whole Pantry, and a number of charities who were to receive donations, for comment.
