Victim: Gary Adams was 17 when he was killed by his stepfather John Xypolitos in 2003

A man killed his teenage stepson then went and had dinner with the boy's mother as if nothing were wrong, a court heard today.

John Xypolitos allegedly murdered 17-year-old Gary Adams with a hammer in his garden shed in Melbourne, then entered the house and sat down to eat with his girlfriend Jo-Ann Adams.

The killer 'was sitting there chatting away' and showed no sign of stress, Ms Adams told his murder trial.

The next day, Xypolitos dismembered the victim and buried his remains in his parents' backyard, where they were not found for eight years, the court was told.

The defendant, 57, has admitted 
killing Gary but insists that it was self-defence and has pleaded not 
guilty to the teenager's murder.

However,
the prosecution alleges that the pair had a difficult relationship and 
that Xypolitos killed the boy in a 'meticulous and calculated fashion'.

Ms
Adams told the Victorian Supreme Court today that on the night of her 
son's disappearance on December 5, 2003, her boyfriend had said that the
teenager had gone out for the night.

She said that Xypolitos cooked dinner for her and did not seem distressed in any way, according to AAP.

'He just seemed like he had a good day at work and he was quite fine, he was sitting there chatting away,' she told the court.

'We sat there watching TV together while we were eating tea... he didn't look stressed, he didn't look like something bad had happened.'

Ms Adams said that the pair often argued but had never had a physical fight as far as she knew.In a police interview, she said that Gary had resisted Xypolitos' efforts to act as a father figure.

But in court today, she denied that her partner had tried to be paternal towards her son.

The hearing was previously told that Xypolitos attacked the teenager with a screwdriver before killing him with two or three blows to the head.

He then allegedly hid his body in a paddling pool and locked the shed, before returning the next morning to cut up the victim with a hacksaw.

Xypolitos is accused of dumping some of Gary's body parts in tips around Melbourne, and burying the rest in his parents' yard.

He apparently confessed the murder to an undercover policeman last year, although he denies doing so.

The trial continues.
