Speeding motorists won't be shouting 'catch me if you can' at Dubai's police force anymore after its officers started driving around in a fleet of 190mph super cars.

The emirate is known for its multi-millionaire petrolheads, who drive around the wealthy state in some of the world's finest vehicles.

Not to be outdone, the force's officers are now cruising around in a Lamborghini, Ferrari, Bentley and Mercedes - all capable of speeds in excess of 190mph.

Try getting away from this: One of the Dubai police force's super vehicles, a £1.6million Aston Martin One-77

Money no object: The force has been kitted out with all manner of super-fast cars, including this Ferrari FF

Please arrest me: Apparently people booked for speeding have actually asked to be taken to the station in the swish new cars, including this Bentley Continental

They have even kitted out a £1.6 million Aston Martin One-77 with lights and stripes.

Making up the extraordinary fleet of patrol cars are the force's Chevrolet Camaro and Dodge Charger - with all of the performance vehicles decked out in full police livery.

Khalifa Abdullah Mohammad, 25. has been driving around Dubai in a 217mph Lamborghini Aventador police car for the past six weeks.

He said: 'I have issued about 30 tickets to drivers blocking the traffic and parking in prohibited places.

Action: The supercars were brought in to clamp down on speeding, which is a real problem in Dubai

Purpose: Cars like this Mercedes SLS Gullwing could help bring down the number of road deaths

'But the most amazing thing about driving such a car is how people look at you with a big smile.'

Deaths on the road are a common occurrence in the UAE, with one person killed in a traffic incident every 26 hours.

Most of these deaths are caused by speeding, driving without a seatbelt and driving while using mobile phones.

Deadly: One person is killed every 26 hours in traffic accidents

Largesse: Money was no object for the force when it upgraded its fleets of vehicles. Here's its Lamborghini Aventador

The police recently announced anyone caught exceeding 125mph would face legal action and it is hoped the presence of 700bhp supercars will make boy racers think twice.

Following the arrival of the supercars, some motorists are thought to have actually asked to be arrested in the hope they can be taken back to the local nick in a Ferrari.

Mariam Ahmad, who personally owns a Toyota Landcruiser, patrols the streets in a Ferrari FF.

Unmistakable: The Lamborghini Aventador is in full Dubai police livery

Awe-inspiring: Even the officers can't believe their luck that they get to drive cars like the Ferrari FF

She said: 'It is the first time I have driven a sports car. When they chose me I couldn't believe it. Driving it is just amazing.

'It's funny because we hear people begging us to arrest them for any reason so they can have a tour in the Ferrari.

'I miss the car when I'm off duty. My Land Cruiser does not compare.'
