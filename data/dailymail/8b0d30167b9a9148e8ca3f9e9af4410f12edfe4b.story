Cyclone Marcia has thrashed the Queensland coastline, ripping up trees, flooding houses, leaving thousands without power and now it has left a shark stranded on a popular NSW beach. 

The shark, believed to be a dusky whaler, was reportedly dumped on Lennox Head Beach today after ferocious winds and tides lashed down on the tourist town.

Taking to his Facebook page, local Victor Leto posted the unbelievable photo, which was taken by Andy Leto and appears to show the four-foot shark stuck on the sand.

Cyclone Marcia has thrashed the Queensland coastline, ripping up trees, flooding houses, leaving thousands without power and now it has left a shark stranded on a popular beach 

While the shark does look a lot bigger than four-feet in the photo, Mr Leto has confirmed that it was definitely smaller than it appears and said it was not attacked by another shark. 

'Poss said he thought it's fins and tail moved a couple of times only to realise it was the wind,' Mr Leto said in a Facebook comment. 

'There have been a lot of sharks lately and some have been accidentally caught by fisherman, as the sharks take their catch as they reel it in an ensuing fight can occur with the shark usually snapping the lines. It's possible in it's weakened state the rough weather/seas then washed it up' Mr Leto said.
