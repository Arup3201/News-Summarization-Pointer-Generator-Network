In trouble: Ryan Davies, 14, has been banned from driving a motorised vehicle despite being three years underage

A foul-mouthed baby-faced biker was banned from driving today, even though he is only 14.

Ryan Davies may be three years under the legal driving age but after roaring around on motorbikes, quadbikes and mopeds the authorities have stepped in to stop him.

Schoolboy Davies was given a two-year ASBO banning him from driving 'any motorised vehicle' as well as 'shouting, swearing and harrassing' people in Caerphilly, South Wales.

Magistrates heard Davies 'ruined the quality of life' of his neighbours and local businesses by bombing around on motorbikes.

Caerphilly Magistrates' Court warned him he could be sent to a young offdenders' institution if he breaches the anti social behaviour order.

A spokesman for Caerphilly Council said: 'Ryan displayed frequent anti-social and nuisance behaviour.

'He was issued with a number of formal warnings as part of our 'four strikes' process in an effort to control his behaviour.

'Incidents related to a variety of motorised vehicles, including a quad bike, mini moto and a moped.'

Pc Stuart Lewis of Gwent Police added: 'This young person's behaviour was clearly affecting the quality of life of local residents and shop owners.

'Now that boundaries have been placed upon this young person I'm sure it will provide some comfort and respite to the victims.'
