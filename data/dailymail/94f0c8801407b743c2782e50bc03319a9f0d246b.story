Not so lucky: Maria Martin, 48, is currently serving a 33-month federal prison sentence for stealing more than $800,000 and losing it all on casino slot games

An Oklahoma mother was caught stealing more than $800,000 from ATM machines, and authorities say she lost it all gambling at local casinos.

Authorities caught 48-year-old Lawton mother Maria Martin when the gas station ATMs she was supposed to be filling kept turning up empty.

Martin's job was to refill the ATMs with funds from Arvest Bank and Fort Sill Credit Union, but instead she started keeping the money in 2011 to spend at the casinos.

Prosecutors say she visited local casinos like Comanche Nation at least once a week, and would spend up to $70,000 in stolen money on the slots.

On one occasion she made ten visits to a casino in a single day.

In January, the former Girl Scout troop leader was sentenced to 33 months in federal prison.

'It's just outrageous,' US Attorney Sanford Coates told KFOR.

'Obviously, you have the banks and financial institutions whose money was taken, and over $800,000 in course of the scheme, but the other layer of victim is the company that she worked for. This was a company that was a small business, very successful, had been around for many years, decades. They lost a lot of trust from their clients, and lost a lot of business,' Coats added.

But Martin's attorney says her crimes are only a product of a sad addiction to gambling.

'She had no prior criminal history. She was a home run mother, an outstanding law abiding citizen, and I think thatâ€™s what the tragedy is int his case. It just points out what can happen when somebody develops a gambling problem,' Herring said.

Martin is currently in Texas federal prison and will be for the next 30 months. Once she gets out, Martin will be on probation for five years and will have to pay back the money she stole from the banks.
