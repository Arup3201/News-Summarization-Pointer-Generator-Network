ISIS has released a video claiming to show a young boy executing two Russian spies in the Islamic State.

The footage shows a boy and an ISIS soldier standing behind the two kneeling 'spies', after which the boy allegedly shoots the grey-clad men in the back of their heads.

However, lack of visible injuries on the men and evidence of blood after the killings suggest the executions may be staged for the cameras.  

Horror: ISIS released the footage which claims to show a young boy executing two Kazakh men for 'spying' 

The seven-and-a-half minute video starts with interviews with the two men where they admit to spying on ISIS on behalf of Russia.

The men tell an interviewer off-camera their names are Mamayev Jambulat Yesenajovich and Ashimov Sergey Nikolayavich, that they are Kazakh and were recruited by 'Russian Intelligence'.

The 'execution scene' sees the ISIS soldier dressed in a camouflage uniform with the young boy standing next to him holding a handgun.

The soldier speaks to the camera, saying that 'Allah has gifted the Islamic State with these two spies'.

'Execution': The two men are seen kneeling on the ground and before the boy walks up behind them, appearing to be shooting them both in the back of the head

The real deal? Lack of evidence of injuries shown in the video suggests the execution may be staged

Brainwashed: The young boy is interviewed after the executions, declaring that we will become a 'mujahid'

'By Allah's grace, they are now in the custory of the lion cubs of the Khilafah,' he adds.

The boy walks up behind the 'spies' and appears to be shooting them both in the back of the head, before raising the gun and cheering.

After the supposed executions, the young boys is asked who he will be 'in the future'

'I will be the one who slaughters you, o kuffar (non-Muslim),' the smiling boy responds.

'I will be a mujahid, insha'allah (God willing)'

MailOnline has not been able to verify the authenticity of the video, which was uploaded to an anonymous vidme account linked to a Twitter user no longer in use.
