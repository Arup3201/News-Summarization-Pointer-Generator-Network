Nick Clegg today launched an outspoken pre-election attack on the Tories he has spent five years sharing power with.

The Lib Dem leader used his final conference speech before polling day to mock the 'red-faced bluster of right-wing Tories', compare David Cameron to 'Nigel Farage in White tie', and declare: 'Cows moo. Dogs bark. And Tories cut.'

In a desperate plea to be returned to power after May 7, he warned the Tories would not be fair and Labour would ruin the economy.

Addressing delegates in Liverpool, Mr Clegg urged his party to 'think big', hailing Britain as an 'open-hearted, open-minded, optimistic country'.

Mr Clegg, who was joined on stage by his wife Miriam, said there was nowhere in the world like the UK 'nowhere as gutsy, nowhere as hopeful, nowhere as welcoming'.

'We are a small island, but we are a big, big country,' he added.

But he warned this was threatened by Labour and the Conservatives abandoning the centre ground.

After years of austerity, he insisted there was now 'light at the end of the tunnel'.

'While the job of fixing our economy is not over yet, the end is in sight.'

He said austerity could end in three years' time, but claimed that the Tories wanted to continue cutting public spending far beyond what was necessary.

He claimed that 'everywhere you look there is blame and division', including Ukip pandering to fear and Tory Home Secretary Theresa May sending out vans telling migrants to 'Go Home'.

And he took aim at the Chancellor, with whom he has spent the last week negotiating the details of Wednesday's Budget.

In the speech Clegg claimed that 'everywhere you look there is blame and division', including Ukip pandering to fear and Tory Home Secretary Theresa May sending out vans telling migrants to 'Go Home'

He pointed to the 'glint in George Osborne's eye as he announced that the working age poor will bear the brunt of the cuts'.

He launched the direct attack on his coalition partners by claiming they posed a  threat to education by refusing to protect pre-school and college funding.

'Cows moo. Dogs bark. And Tories cut. It's in their DNA,' he said.

The Lib Dems and Tories have clashed over Mr Osborne's plan to rule out any future tax rises and tackle the deficit through cuts alone, including taking another £12billion out of the welfare budget.

Mr Clegg claimed this would mean eight million families on the lowest wages would be £1,500 worse off.

He said the Tories had refused to target the wealthy, describing them as 'their friends in big business and big houses'.

'They're not even pretending they want us to be "all in this together" any more.

'The Conservative plan for the next government is an ideological lurch to the right.

'They have gone from being the self-proclaimed heirs to Blair to Nigel Farage in white tie.

'And yet they have the gall to say they are staying on the road to recovery.

'They are not staying on the road, they are veering off it.'

He said Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne cannot have it both ways, claiming the government has done the right thing and then calling for drastic changes.

'Either we are doing the right thing or we aren't. If we are then why won't you stick with it?

'I'll tell you why: because left to their own devices the Conservatives will cut public services, take away support from the poor and look after their own kind in a way they haven't been able to do in this Government because we were there to stop them.'

He also turned his fire on the Labour Party, claiming the most interesting they have done is 'buy a pink van'.

He said Ed Miliband's pledge card to voters, launched yesterday, contained £70billion of extra borrowing.

'It's not a pledge card, it's a credit card and you, me and every other British taxpayer will be paying the bill for years to come.'

He warned the liberal values of modern Britain would be under threat if either the Tories or Labour attempted to govern with the support of a 'rag tag mob' of MPs from Ukip or the SNP.

Despite dire polls suggesting Lib Dems could lose more than half of their seats, Mr Clegg insisted his party was 'here to stay'.

He ruled out being part of a formal coalition deal involving either the SNP or Ukip, although aides would not reject the idea of those parties being involved in a looser confidence and supply arrangement.

The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'Just like we would not put Ukip in charge of Europe, we are not going to put the SNP in charge of Britain - a country they want to rip apart. It's just not going to happen.'

He insisted: 'Only the Liberal Democrats will keep Britain on track and govern for the whole country.

'We have shown that we are prepared to put the national interest first, even if it means taking a hit to our short-term popularity.

'And we will continue to put the national interest first. If others won't stand up to the growing mood of divisive populism, we will.'

After the speech Clegg, who ruled out entering a coalition with SNP or Ukip after the election, raised his arms in the air

He said the story of the next five years must be one of hope.

'If you are thinking of voting Conservative but are worried that they won't be fair – don't do it.

'If you are thinking of voting Labour but are worried they will ruin the economy – don't do it.

'If you think a vote for UKIP, or the Greens, or the SNP is harmless – it isn't.

'If you want a stable government that won't lurch to the extremes of left or right, you have to vote for it.

'If you want a stronger economy and a fairer society, you have to vote for it.

'If you want a government that will create opportunities for everyone, vote Liberal Democrat.

'This is a fight for our future, for the decent values of our country – we can and we must win.'
