Victim: Cpl Geoffrey McNeill was found dead at his Army barracks on Saturday morning

A 23-year-old soldier has been charged with murdering a corporal who was found dead at an Army barracks four days ago.  

Richard Farrell was today remanded in custody over the death of Geoffrey McNeill, of the 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment.  

The corporal's body was discovered in an accommodation block at Clive Barracks in Tern Hill, Shropshire on Saturday morning.  

Farrell - a member of the same battalion - has been in custody at Shrewsbury police station since he was arrested two hours after Cpl McNeill was found dead.

Today he appeared at Telford Magistrates' Court, where he spoke only to confirm his name and address, and was ordered to be remanded in custody.

There were reports of two soldiers fighting during a night out hours before Cpl McNeillâ€™s body was found.

An Army spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a serving soldier has been charged with murder by West Mercia Police. It would be inappropriate to comment any further at this stage.'

After the unmarried corporal's death, his family said: 'Geoff was born in Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, and dedicated his life to the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment,' he said.

'He served his country with the highest degree of honour and dedication.  

'He was a much-loved son, brother, uncle and friend and touched the lives of all who had the pleasure of meeting him.

Tributes: Cpl McNeill's family described him as 'a much-loved son, brother, uncle and friend'

Discovery: Cpl McNeill's body was found in an accommodation block around 9am on Saturday

'The family would like to give thanks for
 the continued support of the Army, police and all who knew and loved 
Geoff. Our love for him remains as strong as ever. Rest in peace 
soldier. Faugh a Ballagh.'

Cpl McNeill is from the same battalion deployed last month to help flood-stricken communities in Worcestershire, after record amounts of rain fell across the UK.

Members of the unit met David Cameron at Upton-upon-Severn on February 17, when the Prime Minister was touring some of the county's flood defences.  

During that visit, Mr Cameron praised the soldiers' efforts in using their troop carriers to set up a shuttle bus service to get people from one side of the flooded river to the other, while residents also expressed their delight at the military's presence.  

Although it can trace its origins back to 1688, the Royal Irish Regiment formed in 1992 when the Royal Irish Rangers was merged with the Ulster Defence Regiment.

The 1st Battalion, based at Tern Hill, Shropshire, is a light role battalion, rotating with two other line infantry/rifles battalions in the air assault role as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade.   

The Regiment recruits from all sections of the Northern Irish community, on both sides of the sectarian divide.   

In September 2008 the battalion completed a tour in Afghanistan and it became the first unit in the Army to receive three Conspicuous Gallantry Crosses in a single operation   

Base: The entrance to Clive Barracks, where the 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment is headquartered

Barracks: The base is known for being targeted by IRA terrorists in February 1989

Recently troops from the battalion deployed to Mali in support of the EU training mission and the most recent battalion size operational deployment was in 2011 as part of Operation HERRICK 13 in Afghanistan.   

The slogan of the regiment is 'Faugh a Ballagh', an Irish battle cry meaning 'Clear the way'.   

Clive Barracks opened in 1916 and has been home to 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Regiment since 2007 when the battalion moved from Fort George, Inverness.   

The barracks hit the headlines on February 20, 1989 after a pair of IRA terrorists activated two bombs within the accommodation block.
