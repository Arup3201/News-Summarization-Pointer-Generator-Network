Bravest officer in England: Pc Alex Stypulkowski was named overall winner at the annual Police Bravery Awards

A policeman who was repeatedly stabbed with a screwdriver but still managed to chase down and apprehend his attacker has been named the bravest officer in the country.

Pc Alex Stypulkowski was stabbed in the neck and back while attempting to detain a dangerous man with mental health issues.

The attacker ran off, but despite his injuries PC Stypulkowski and a fellow officer gave chase, eventually managing to stun the man with a taser and arrest him.

He was last night honoured for his actions at the annual Police Bravery Awards where he was named 'overall winner' for 'his determination to arrest the man despite near fatal injuries to himself'.

Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: 'PC Stypulkowski deserves the highest praise for his courage and determination.

'Knowing the risks, PC Stypulkowski fearlessly put his own life on the line to pursue this very dangerous offender.'

Receiving the accolade last night at the Police Bravery Awards, he said the award was 'an absolute honour'.

Pc Stypulkowski, from Hampshire, told the audience: 'It is absolutely incredible. The stories from everywhere else have been just fantastic, it's an absolute honour.'

The ceremony was held at London's Plaisterers' Hall before a reception at 10 Downing Street.

PC Stypulkowski had been called to assist social services and firearms officers in sectioning a man under the mental health act in Petersfield in November 2010.

When he arrived at the scene, the suspect attempting to escape so PC Stypulkowski gave chase but became separated from his colleagues.

It was then that the man stopped and turned around holding a screwdriver, telling the officer: 'You're going to die'.

Despite PC Stypulkowski spraying him with CS gas, the assailant continued towards him and the pair fell to floor in a struggle where the officer felt several sharp blows to his neck and back.

Another officer arrived on the scene and the attacker ran off with both policemen giving chase and eventually arresting him after PC Stypulkowski's colleague used a Taser stun gun.

It was only when PC Stypulkowski was later taken to hospital that he discovered he had been repeatedly stabbed in his back and neck - with one wound narrowly missing his jugular vein.

Tribute was paid during the evening to Pcs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes who were shot after attending what appeared to be a routine burglary call in Hattersley, Greater Manchester.

Off-duty Pc Ian Dibell from Essex Police, who lost his life when he was gunned down as he went to help a neighbour who was being attacked, was also remembered.

Praising their 'truly heroic acts', Chairman of the Police Federation Paul McKeever named a number of officers in the UK who have recently lost their lives, including Pc David Rathband who took his own life after being blinded by gunman Raoul Moat.

Mr McKeever said: 'We will not forget them. And we will not forget someone I have had the privilege of getting to know over the past year or two, a very great man, a man of fortitude and strength. That was David Rathband who sadly is no longer with us this year.

'We remember all the officers who have lost their lives this year and over the years.'

Eight regional winners were chosen from a total of 53 nominees who had been put forward by forces across the country.
