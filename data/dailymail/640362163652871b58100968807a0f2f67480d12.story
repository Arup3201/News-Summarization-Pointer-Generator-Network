A Delaware restaurant has come under fire after photographs of bad tippers and their receipts were uploaded to its social networking sites alongside offensive and racist messages.

The Padi Restaurant in Hockessin has apologized after images appeared on its manager's Instagram account and the eatery's Facebook page calling people names such as 'cheap' and 'hillbilly'.

But the manager, Aaron Kwan, has denied he took the images or wrote the messages - and has instead blamed other employees for accessing his online profiles when he was not looking.

After the Wilmington News Journal reported about the messages, the Instagram and Facebook accounts were promptly removed. The News Journal shared several of the offensive messages.

In trouble: Offensive and racist messages have appeared on the Instagram account of restaurant manager Aaron Kwan - but he denies that he was the one who posted them

Among them, there was a photo of a bill for $53.80 for a customer with an Indian surname, who had tipped $5.20 - less than 10 per cent.

The photo appeared on the Instagram account, fumanchu85, alongside the message: 'What do you expect from a last name like that? #cheap #jew'

In a similar message, where a diner with a $45.90 bill paid a $6.10 tip, the person wrote: 'With a last name like that, I don’t think you will ever expect a GOOD tip. #cheap #jerk #indian.'

And another image shows a customer paying his bill with the message: '#deuchbag alert. ... hate him and his family. No respect for anyone ever' - before using a derogatory term for the man's wife.

Offensive: In one message, a worker posted a picture of a receipt which showed a customer with an Indian surname had left a small tip (top), and then they added an angry message (bottom)

He also refered to customers as '#cheapass' and '#hillbillies' in the messages.

The News Journal also reported that negative comments were shared on the restaurant's Facebook page, which has now also been removed.

'People need
 to take their meds before leaving the comfort of their home,' an October post reads. 'Why would 
you come to an Asian restaurant when you don’t feel like having Asian 
food.'

Kwan, who reportedly would regularly upload pictures of himself to the Instagram account, said he barely used the application and should have checked it more to see if anyone else had access.

He added that the messages probably came from other staff members.

Rude: Other messages attack diners on the restaurant's public Facebook group for eating takeout there

Site: Many of the messages were posted to the manager's Instagram, pictured, but he says it was hacked

'It may be hacked because I left my iPad and stuff all around,' he told Delaware Online. 'Probably some other water or waitress got really mad.'

Edward B. Rosenthal, an attorney representing the restaurant's owner and Kwan's aunt, Eve Teoh, said the business is working hard to restore its image after the messages emerged two weeks ago.

Teoh has written an open letter to customers that hangs beside the counter, apologizing for 'unacceptable and insulting behavior'.

'We
 sincerely apologize for those actions, and want the community to know 
that those actions and opinions are not consistent with our beliefs and 
values, nor are they welcome at our restaurant.

Scene: The owner of Padi Restaurant - Kwan's aunt - said they will investigate who is responsible

Inside: Kwan said he thinks other workers accessed his personal profiles when he left his phone out

Damage control: Chef Patrick Wong and owner Eve Teoh have apologized for the offensive messages

'We want to 
assure all of our customers, and members of the community, that those 
responsible for insulting our customers and members of the community 
will be held accountable, and that we are taking steps to insure that 
this type of behavior never happens again,' the letter reads.

Rosenthal added that Kwan was on indefinite unpaid leave.

'We're holding him responsible,' he said. 'But we feel there may have been other people [involved].'

He added that there will be meetings with staff members to discuss about how they are expected to represent the message of the restaurant on all fronts.
