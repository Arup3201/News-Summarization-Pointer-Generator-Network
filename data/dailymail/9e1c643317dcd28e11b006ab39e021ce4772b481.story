A nine-year-old girl is the lone survivor of a deadly car wreck that claimed her aunt and two cousins.

Melina Pruitt, 30, was driving near Gordo, Alabama just after 4.30pm on Saturday when she lost control of her 2002 Ford Explorer, veered off the road and smashed into a tree, troopers said.

She was killed in the crash along with her daughters, 12-year-old Cailey Goad, and seven-year-old Railyn Pruitt. Their nine-year-old cousin, who has not been identified, survived the crash.

Scene: The car lost control and hit this tree in Gordo, Alabama as they drove to the movies on Saturday

The little girl was airlifted and remains hospitalized in the ICU of Children's of Alabama in Birmingham. Troopers said she was the only one wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash.

Pruitt's husband, Anthony, told WRBC that his wife, their daughter Railyn, his stepdaughter Cailey and a niece were going to a movie theater when they crashed a mile from their home.

Mr Pruitt was at home watching the Iron Bowl at the time of the crash.

On Sunday, family members placed a heart with the word 'Love' near the crash site. A tree with ripped bark bore reference to Saturday afternoon's tragedy.

Friends and relatives have flocked to social media to pass on their thoughts and prayers.

'We lost a angel today,' one friend wrote on Twitter. 'Cailey Goad. She died in a car wreck along with her mother and sister. I can't explain how I felt when I got the news.'

Another added: 'RIP BEAUTIFUL WE WILL MISS YOU AND WE LOVE YOU.You will never be forgotten.'

Classmates at Cailey's school wore blue in remembrance of her on Monday, and penned 'Fly High Cailey' on their arms.

The apparently vivacious middle school student had also been an avid user of social networking.

'12 years young!' she wrote on her Instagram profile. 'Your time is limited, don't waste it!'
