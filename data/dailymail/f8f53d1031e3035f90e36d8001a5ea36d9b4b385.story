Police shifted their search and a northeastern Pennsylvania school district tightened security amid another reported sighting Monday of the suspect in a deadly state police ambush.

A local law enforcement official reported seeing suspect Eric Frein near the Swiftwater Post Office in the Pocono Mountains, leading to an intensive police search.

Frein, 31, was not captured, Trooper Connie Devens said Monday night, and police are still searching for him more than a month after he shot dead a trooper and seriously injured another.

The post office is near Pocono Mountain East High School, Frein's old school. A woman out for a walk on Friday night spotted a rifle-toting man with a mud-covered face at the school.

On Tuesday morning, police swarmed around a clothing bin, which is used to collect clothing donations, in Swiftwater before moving on.

The Pocono Mountain School District also decided to cancel classes for Tuesday - even though officials said on Monday they would remain open.

State Police Trooper Tom Kelly explained classes were called off 'as a result of the police activity in the area of the school'.

Frein, 31, is charged with opening fire outside the Blooming Grove state police barracks on September 12, killing Pennsylvania State Police Corporal Bryon Dickson and seriously injuring Trooper Alex Douglass.

Authorities had been searching for him in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis but shifted their primary search area five or six miles to the southwest after Friday night's sighting.

Lt. Col. George Bivens said over the weekend that police have put a 'tremendous amount of pressure on him' and likely forced him to move.

The high school, Frein's alma mater, and all other schools in the Pocono Mountain School District were open Monday but took extra precautions in light of the Friday sighting.

Additional officers from the Pocono Mountain Regional Police Department were stationed at the district's Swiftwater campus to supplement the lone police officer who normally patrols that location, which, besides the high school, includes a junior high and elementary school.

Pennsylvania State Police did not recommend that schools close, district spokeswoman Wendy Frable said.  

'We would not bring the students in if we did not have reassurance from police they felt the campus was safe,' she said Monday morning.

Hours later, as police ramped up their search efforts in the area in response to the latest possible sighting, district officials moved outdoor after-school athletic practices to another campus. 

Attack: Frein, 31, allegedly shot dead Pennsylvania State Police Corporal Bryon Dickson as he stepped outside his barracks on September 12. He then allegedly shot Trooper Alex Douglass, seriously injuring him

State police have said they believe Frein, a self-taught survivalist, has a hatred of law enforcement and wants to target police, not the general public. 

State police said Monday that blood found at two homes in the search area is not linked to Frein. 

DNA testing ruled out any link to Frein in blood droplets found on a covered porch in the area. Material found on a back door at a second home near the first turned out not to be human blood.

Police believe Frein could be breaking into vacant cabins or vacation homes to look for food or take shelter.

The search has put a stop to Barrett Township's Halloween festivities and is also affecting tourism to the area thanks to road blocks and hunting restrictions. 

Throughout their search, the survivalist has left police clues.

Most recently, Frein's journal was found ditched at a campsite near his home in Canadensis.

In the diary, he wrote a chilling description of his cold-blooded sniper attack on the Pennsylvania State Police barracks.

'Friday, September 12, got a shot around 11pm, he dropped. I was surprised at how quick,' the diary reads. 'I took a follow-up shot on his head and neck area. He was still and quiet after that.

'Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him, one jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still. I ran back to the Jeep.'

The diary makes no mention of Frein knowing either trooper or that he was intending to target any individual. Instead, it sets out Frein's desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder.
