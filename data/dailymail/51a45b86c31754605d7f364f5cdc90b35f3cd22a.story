Earlier this summer, ride-sharing company Uber claimed that a driver in New York makes an average of $90,000 a year.

Now they have revealed what it takes it reach the salary - working more than 80 hours a week while making an average of $22.50 an hour. 

According to a blog post on their site it is based on drivers being online for 50 weeks of the year, working the same number of hours and using uberX, the cheapest option available to customers.

The chart shows Uber drivers can earn up to $90,000 a year if they work for 80 hours a week and make an average of $21 an hour 

The statistics compiled by the company revealed that drivers made roughly the same amount of money per hour no matter how many they worked in a week. 

This allows drivers to use their own non-luxury vehicles to transport passengers.  

The numbers however do not take into account expenses such as gas and insurance - which the partners have to cover themselves.

However they insisted that drivers are guaranteed to take home $5,000 for 200 hours in a month, no matter what time of day they chose to work.  

A spokesman told the Huffington Post that if the drivers were to work for 40 hours a week - they would earn around $50,000 (or $25.17 an hour) - which according to the US Department for Labor is almost double that of an average taxi driver. 

The post read: 'We’re so confident in the idea that every hour worked with Uber is a good one that we guarantee it - every partner working with Uber in New York is guaranteed $5,000 take home pay for 200 hours of work in a month, regardless of which 200 hours they choose.

'The data illustrates that a substantial number of partners are using the Uber platform to power better economic opportunities. 

'This is a significant change from the status quo and the thousands of drivers on the platform are a testament to that opportunity. 

The company also added that drivers made virtually same amount per hour no matter how many they worked in a week. 

'That predictability is a virtue,' the post continued. 'It allows drivers to work when it’s convenient for them, earning money in between other jobs, work with other companies, or personal time away from work.'

Uber said that their drivers are guaranteed to take home $5,000 a month if they work for 200 hours 

It also means that part time Uber drivers can make more per hour than their full-time counterparts. 

Many partners choose just to work during 'surge-pricing' hours - where fares are hiked to get more cars onto the road.

This means fares can as much as double until a higher number of vehicles are back on the road. 

The base rate for an Uber cab in New York is $3. Then it is an additional $2.15 for for every mile as well as an extra 40 cents per minute.  

In September they revealed that Uber drivers were making more money than ever before, even though fares had gone down, while partners spent almost half their time with a passenger when they were working. 

The company also reported today that it has raised a fresh $1.2 billion in funding, giving the popular ride-sharing startup a reported value of some $40 billion. 

Last month they were forced to apologize after suggesting a plan to spend $1million on a team of researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize his company.
