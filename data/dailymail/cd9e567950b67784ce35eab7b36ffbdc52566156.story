Data retrieved from the MH17 black box is consistent with the plane's fuselage being hit by shrapnel, suggesting it came under missile attack.

An unnamed European air safety official told CBS News: 'It did what it was designed to do - bring down airplanes.'

This comes as Australian and Dutch officials sent to the crash site to recover victims' remains have been hit with fresh obstacles, after more fighting broke out in the area.

Unarmed police were due to be sent to the spot where Malaysian airliner came down in eastern Ukraine to help recover victims' remains. But it emerged that the rebel-held territory is still considered too dangerous.

This comes as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that more Australian Federal Police Officers were being deployed to the crash site as part of the Dutch-led humanitarian mission after Russian separatists agreed to allow access.

So far there are 170 AFP officers in Ukraine with more on the way to join the 11 currently at the crash site.

The 11 officers had been planning to accompany a 30-strong Dutch contingent to the crash site on Sunday guided by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

But the Netherlands' security and justice department says the situation is too unstable. There are reports of heavy shelling in rebel-held Grabove, the village next to the crash site

'The team of 30 Dutch forensic experts currently has no safe passage to the crash site,' the department said in a statement.

'Because of fighting in the region the situation is still too unstable to safely go to the crash site to work.'

The Dutch and Australians are remaining in the the rebel stronghold of Donetsk some 60km from the site.

The mission will not be backed up by military personnel although the Australian Defence Force is providing some enabling support including medical and surgical teams.

Alexander Hug, the deputy head of a monitoring team from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, also confirmed reports of fighting near the city of Donetsk.

'We heard indications there's fighting going on,' he said.

'The situation on the ground appears to be unsafe ... we therefore decided to deploy tomorrow morning,' he said, flanked by Dutch and Australian experts. 

'Fighting in the area will most likely affect (the) crash site,' Hug said.

It follows the deployment in Kiev of an team of EU security advisers to assist the Ukrainian government in imposing the rule of law in rebel districts.

Speaking in Canberra on Sunday, Mr Abbott said, speaking of Australia's intentions: 'Our objective is to get in, get cracking and to get out.'

The 11 Australian officers already at the site have largely been involved in observing and taking photographs. The latest deployment will involve recovering human remains and having them repatriated.

The mission is to stay as long as possible to do a professional job but it should take no longer than two to three weeks, Mr Abbott said.

'We don't want to be there any longer than is absolutely necessary,' he said.

The unarmed nature of the humanitarian mission to the site means it doesn't need the specific approval of the Ukrainian parliament.

But Foreign Minister Julie Bishop hopes a deal can be ratified early this week that would allow Canberra to send a small contingent of armed police and soldiers to help with security.

Ms Bishop stressed on Sunday the mission would be a non-threatening operation.

'All we want to do is secure the site so that we can inspect it thoroughly and bring back any remains,' she said.

Yesterday the Kremlin accused the EU of aiding terrorists through its most recent extension of sanctions. 

Pro-Russia separatists have been blamed for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 with a surface-to-air missile on July 17, killing all 298 people aboard.

They have also been accused of hampering the investigation into the disaster and the recovery of bodies and the property of victims from the site.

Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief, agreed last week to requests from the Ukrainian authorities for urgent help in bolstering the country's security services.

An initial £2 million ($3.7 million AUD) is being provided by the EU to fund the unarmed advisers, but further money is expected to be committed as the conflict continues.

Today the country's prime minister Tony Abbott said that by sending in unarmed police, Ukraine's parliament will not need to ratify the deployment as it would if the security force were to be armed.

A Russian foreign ministry statement condemned sanctions imposed on Friday against 15 named people, including a former Russian prime minister, a former speaker of the Duma (parliament), senior intelligence officials, and leaders of the pro-Russia revolt in eastern Ukraine.

It accused the EU of taking 'a complete turn away from joint work with Russia on international and regional security, including the fight against the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism [and] organised crime'.

The statement went on: 'We are sure the decisions will be greeted enthusiastically by international terrorists. What it wasn't able to do over decades - drive a wedge into the international community - they've done with ease in Brussels.

Russia called the latest US accusations of Moscow's involvement in the Ukrainian conflict a baseless 'smear campaign'

'At the same time, the European Union has once and for all joined the side of Washington and Kiev's fairytales regarding ongoing events in Ukraine, depriving itself of an alternative and objective source of information.

'Do they understand in the capitals of the EU countries what these irresponsible steps could lead to, either in the political or economic spheres?' 

There were 193 Dutch and 43 Malaysian people on MH17 when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on 17 July en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board.

So far 227 coffins containing an unknown number of victims have been taken from the site for identification in Hilversum, near Amsterdam.

One person, a Dutch citizen, has been formally identified.
