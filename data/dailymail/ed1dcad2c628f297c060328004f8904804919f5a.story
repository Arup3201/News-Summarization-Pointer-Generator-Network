Following the huge success of 12 Years A Slave and renewed interest in the life of the story's author Solomon Northup, the New York Times has published a correction after misspelling his name in an article first published 161 years ago.

On January 20, 1853, the newspaper published a story about Northup’s remarkable and traumatic experience. Called The Kidnapping Case, the subhead referred to the 'narrative of the seizure and recovery of Solomon Northrup' - mistakenly adding an extra r - while the article itself repeatedly mis-spelt his surname as 'Northrop'.

On Tuesday, the Times finally published an apology in the Corrections section of the newspaper and online, which explained that ‘the errors came to light on Monday after a Twitter user pointed out the article in The Times archives.’

That Twitter user was Rebecca Skloot, the author of The Immortal Life Of Henrietta Lacks.

After the correction ran, she tweeted, ‘The irony, of course, is that I'm a terrible speller and proofreader.’

The original article, published the same year as Northup’s book 12 Years A Slave, told a summary account of how this free African-American man had been kidnapped, sold into slavery and forced to endure years of terrible hardship and suffering.

Director Steve McQueen’s film adaptation of Northup’s memoir won three Oscars on Sunday night – Best Film, Best Actress In A Supporting Role for Lupita Nyong’o and Best Adapted Screenplay for John Ridley.
