In her black and white dress and chic patent shoes, Sarah Ferguson cut an elegant figure as she joined her daughters for a night out at exclusive nightclub LouLou's.

The former Duchess of York has made no secret of her penchant for parties and is regularly spotted out on the town with her girls.

Fergie and her daughters began the night at Club 45 before heading to exclusive nightclub, LouLou's, which is owned by Robin Birley.

Family fun: Princess Beatrice joined her mother and sister Princess Eugenie for a night out at LouLou's

Low key: Eugenie plumped for a simple look while Beatrice and her mother both opted for monochrome

Flame-haired Beatrice, who recently won a spot on Vogue.com's best-dressed list, chose a stylish all-black ensemble for the family's night out - clearly a favourite of hers as she was wearing it for the second night in a row..

Although the young Royal once more wore her quilted leather skirt, black top and sparkly Anya Hindmarch bag, she did at least exchange her sky-high court shoes for a pair of zebra ballet pumps.

Beatrice has been looking super 
stylish of late and using date nights with her boyfriend and nights on 
the town to put her new-found fashion choices to the test.

Her
and her sister Eugenie's new look is down to the ‘Mary Poppins’ of the 
style world, Sarah Hogan, who was brought in by the Duchess of York to 
be her daughters’ fashion mentor.

Hogan's influence could also be seen in Eugenie's choice, which included a figure-flattering khaki V-neck dress which she teamed with a tan leather shoulder bag and a pair of black canvas espadrilles.

Love: The sisters and their mother were joined by Eugenie's 27-year-old boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank

Risque: Princess Beatrice spent the early part of the night in burlesque nightclub, Cirque du Soir

The younger York princess was accompanied by her bartender boyfriend, 27-year-old Jack Brooksbank.

Loulou's is a favourite Royal hangout and is owned by Mark Birley - oldest son of Lady Annabel Goldsmith and half-brother to Richmond MP Zac.

Along with the York sisters, Pippa Middleton is regularly spotted drinking at the private establishment, and the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William were often seen leaving the club before a certain Royal baby got in the way.

Earlier this month, socialite and activist Jemima Khan was spotted leaving the club on the arm of a mystery man.
