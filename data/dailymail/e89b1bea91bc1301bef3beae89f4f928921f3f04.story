When Ruby Love Lambright was born more than three months premature, she weighed just 1.6 pounds and fitted into her mother's hand.

Now the tiny bundle from Minneapolis has inspired a massive outpouring of goodwill as strangers have donated thousands towards her steep medical bills after hearing of her battle.

After her mother, Lauren Lambright, went into labor at just 25 weeks on July 4, the tiny baby spent four months in the NICU and underwent heart surgery, blood transfusions and eye exams.

And throughout the family's struggles, Ruby earned her middle name.

'Love,' Mrs Lambright told Kare11. 'We just loved her so much. We never loved anything so much in our
entire life, so it became her middle name. I think Ruby is the best definition I can think of of a miracle.'

But over her treatments, medical bills exceeded $10,000, which her parents said they are struggling to pay, according to their Facebook page and fundraising page.

Yet when Tiffany Kokal, founded of Red Velvet Moments Photography, learned of Ruby's story, she sprung into action, realising she could use her skills to benefit the family.

'When I met them they are fun, outgoing happy people,' Kokal, who first met Lambright at her old job at a dentist's. 'For such a sad thing to go through their spirits never seem down.'

Kokal, who has taken heart-melting photographs of the baby girl, offered free Christmas portraits over two days and simply asked that families donated to the Lambrights in exchange.

She explained her idea on Facebook - and could barely keep up with the number of families who wanted to help.

'I'm receiving more than I have ever 
received all of my Christmas life. Having done this and it makes me want
to give more,' Kokal told Kare11.

Travis Lambright, Ruby's father, added of the generosity: 'It's just flooring, mind boggling.'

After the hundreds of dollars the family
has raised themselves, Kokal added $2,000 to the pot. And, as the word 
of the photographer's kindness spreads, other strangers are digging 
deep.

'We certainly never thought of asking for help on Facebook but we are so overjoyed people would ask us to do so,' the family wrote on Facebook.

'Lauren has been forced to be out of work a
lot longer than we ever anticipated to care for Ruby and we have been 
trying to cut back everywhere we can. Travis works hard to provide but with the unexpected expenses rolling in it can be hard to make it all work.

'There are a few areas of need and you can choose to support us in anyway that tugs at your heart because we appreciate any little bit of help we get so very much!'

Ruby is still using a breathing monitor but now weighs more than seven pounds.

Safe: They said they are looking forward to recounting the story to Ruby when she is older

The Lambrights said that they can't wait to recount the story to Ruby when she is old enough, to show her how special she is.

'I realized that I want her to know that I believe she is a gift and not just a gift but the BEST gift in the whole wide world,' Lauren wrote of Ruby in an entry on her CaringBridge site.

'This whole experience has shown me just how fragile her life is and I am looking forward to every dirty diaper and sleepless night because I will be with her and she will be with me and that is just absolutely amazing!'
