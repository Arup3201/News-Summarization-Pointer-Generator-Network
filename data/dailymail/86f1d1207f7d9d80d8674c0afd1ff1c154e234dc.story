Napoli defender Federico Fernandez will undergo a medical with Swansea on Thursday ahead of an £8million move to the Premier League. 

The Argentina international played four times for his country at the World Cup this summer.

He emerged as a major target for Garry Monk following an agreement to sell central defender Chico Flores to Qatari side Lekhwiya.

Fernandez joined Napoli in 2011 from Argentine side Estudiantes, though he was shipped out to Getafe on loan for the 2012-13 campaign.

He made 26 Serie A appearances for Rafa Benitez's side last season, helping them finish third in the league and win the Coppa Italia.

The 25-year-old will be a direct replacement for Flores, who is understood to have said goodbye to his team-mates ahead of his move to the Middle East.
