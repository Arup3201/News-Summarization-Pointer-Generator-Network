As the saying goes, herding cats is a particularly difficult task.

And one couple proved just that when they came to leave a hotel in Long Island, New York.

Jeffrey Johnson, 55, and his wife, Shoshanah, discovered one of their beloved 17 felines - that they had transported to the pet-friendly Marriott Residence Inn in Islip with them - was missing.

After spending hours searching for the cat, named Cotton, the pair reluctantly boarded their scheduled flight from John F Kennedy airport to Israel, where they were moving with their son.

However, prior to departure, they struck a deal with hotel staff to have the two-year-old animal taken to a vet, then shipped to Tel Aviv, for a fee if it was found,  the New York Post reported.

Three days later, hotel manager, Kerri Black, reportedly sent an email to the couple saying she had located Cotton and was looking after the cat at her boyfriend's  house before shipping.

'No worries. I don’t know where she is though. She has been hiding somewhere. I just put food out... she ate them last night,' Miss Black allegedly wrote.

But at the Ronkonkoma house, the feline slid behind a wall, where it hid undisturbed for nine days, before vanishing again - seemingly for good.

Now, the Johnsons have a filed a lawsuit against the Marriott Reisdence Inn in the Eastern District, in which they are seeking a minimum of $150,000 in damages, according to Jezebel.com. 

The couple - who reportedly have 31 cats in total - contend Miss Black went against instructions to take Cotton to a veterinarian so arrangements could be made to ship her to Israel. 

'It has been traumatic. She’s a really special cat,' Mr Johnson, who now lives in Had Nes, Israel, said. 'Really, we just want Cotton back.' 

Following Cotton's disappearance in July, the Johnsons were reportedly handed a $460 bill for the two days their pet was missing at the hotel before it was discovered by staff.

This is because managers were forced to relocate guests who were supposed to be staying in the suite in case the animal was still in the room.

In August, the owners - who have two daughters as well as their 13-year-old son - returned to Long Island in a bid to locate their treasured pet.

But despite posting signs around the area, they had no joy - Cotton is still missing. 'I absolutely believe Cotton is still alive, living in the wild,' Mr Johnson told the New York Daily News.

The newspaper's attempts to contact Marriott and the hotel were unsuccessful.
