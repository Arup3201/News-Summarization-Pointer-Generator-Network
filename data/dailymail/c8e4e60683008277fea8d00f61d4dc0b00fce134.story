A change of pace was needed in my life – and a bit of detox.

I am due to shoot a Made In Chelsea six-episode mini-series in New York City throughout June and July and I want to look my best.

So before I started filming in the Big Apple, I decided to go the beautiful island of  St Barts for a bit of R&R.

I am in a 
rather fortunate position that my parents own the Eden Rock hotel on the
 island and so it would be a great opportunity to catch up with them and
 be pampered in six-star luxury at the same time.

There
 were also two added benefits to travelling to the island is in 
low-season (April to August) firstly all the nightclubs would be shut so
 there would be little or no temptation to go large, and secondly the 
most amazing villas at the hotel were less likely to be booked up.

And
 I was in luck – the Rockstar villa was free – 16,000 sq foot of 
high-end luxury – four ultra-luxe king bed suites, black tiled pool with
 outdoor Jacuzzi, terrace, kitchen, butlers, pool table and it’s own bar
 and even a recording studio.

Too big in fact to enjoy on one’s own so I invited Stevie Johnson and Ollie Proudlock from MIC along with me.

They are both bon viveurs but not total party animals, so they weren’t likely to lead me astray. In fact Prooders is a bit of a gym bunny so he was likely to be a good influence on me.

So my life revolved around a healthy low-carb diet, work-out sessions in the fully equipped gym in the villa and 5km morning runs around the golden sand of Saint-Jean Bay.

I’m still using the Forza T5 Super Strength supplements as well and they have got me down to around 10 to 12 per cent body fat.

In the photo of Proudlock and I flexing on the terrace of the Rockstar villa you can see that we are close to the shape we were in when we took the Men’s Health challenge back in November last year.

I also wanted to get a bit of a tan during my time in the Caribbean but I took on-board the advice of beautician Debbie Thomas, who gave me a Skinbreeze anti-aging facial last week.

So to prevent too much sun damage I used lotion with at least an SPF of 20. That for me is a compromise – before my Skinbreeze conversion I would use oil on my face and lemon juice on my hair, with an SPF of zero.

The 10 days in St Barts flew by and before we knew it, it was time to take the propeller plane to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to fly out to New York. BTW – this is pretty hairy for even seasoned flyers and I could see that Stevie in particular was gripping his seat on the plane pretty tightly.

I write this from my apartment in New York’s Meatpacking district. We have a well-proportioned flat and it’s a trendy part of town – think Shoreditch in London - which I’m sharing with Proudlock and Stevie.

You can see us posing on the roof, and at present it’s fairly tidy but I know that’s unlikely to stay the case but so far we haven’t spent much time there.

We landed at about midnight and hit the ground running, dropped off our bags and went straight out clubbing. It was incredible, great energy, full of sassy and smart beautiful women. I love New York.
