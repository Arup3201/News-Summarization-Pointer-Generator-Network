There were ‘missed opportunities’ to save an expectant mother who bled to death when her placenta was ‘ripped out’ during childbirth, an inquest heard today.

‘Alarm bells’ should have been ringing when Claire Teague, 29, began asking for an ambulance shortly after the home delivery, midwife supervisor Suzanne Cro said.

She told Windsor Coroner’s Court photographs of Mrs Teague’s placenta indicated it was ‘obvious’ 30 per cent was missing, which would have shown something was badly wrong.

Young mother Mrs Teague died after she suffered a massive haemorrhage caused by the incomplete delivery of her placenta during the home birth in the early hours of August 1, 2010.

At the time, she was being cared for by independent midwife Rosie Kacary, who she hired when she became pregnant for the second time in 2009.

It was after she had lost one of her twins during an emergency caesarean section earlier that year.

Yesterday, Mrs Teague’s husband Simon told the hearing that he watched as Ms Kacary ‘ripped out’ his wife’s placenta using ‘a lot of force and tugging.’

Senior health professional Ms Cro was drafted in to write a report for the Nursing and Midwifery Council, to see if lessons could be learned from the tragedy.

She told the hearing she felt Ms Kacary 
should have noticed the placenta was not intact. Ms Cro said: 'I’ve 
looked at the photographs and it’s very obvious that part of the 
placenta is missing.

‘To me, looking at the photographs, I felt that the placenta does not look complete and would have had concerns about it.’

Ms Cro also said a text message from Mrs 
Teague’s husband Simon as he became increasingly anxious should have 
rung ‘alarm bells’ with Ms Kacary.

'I’ve looked at the photographs and it’s very obvious that part of the placenta is missing. To me, looking at the photographs, I felt that the placenta does not look complete and would have had concerns about it'

In the message, Mr Teague reveals that his wife, who was terrified of hospitals, is asking for an ambulance.

‘I would hope from that text that I would have asked for questions,’ Ms Cro said. ‘It would have set off alarm bells in my mind that if she is fit and well then why does she need an ambulance?

‘Especially someone like Claire who had an aversion to hospitals - I would be thinking: “Why now does she want to go in an ambulance?”’

Ms Cro also said she was concerned Ms Kacary’s notes of her discussions with Mrs Teague about the risks of a home birth were incomplete.

As she had previously undergone a caesarean and required a blood transfusion, the expectant mother would have been at a higher risk of complications, she said.

The inquest was told that the case was under investigation by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Ms Kacary was previously investigated by the regulator for another birth but was allowed to keep practising, the hearing was told. The inquest, which is expected to finish today, continues.
