The Apprentice winner Stella English is believed to be 'seriously concerned' for her safety after receiving death threats, it has been claimed.

A friend of the 34-year-old, who lives in Kent, said she has been 'left distraught' by a man who is stalking her with threatening phone-calls. 

The friend said: 'She is very emotional and is seriously concerned for her safety.

'She has spoken to the police twice about the matter.' 

Last night Miss English told The Mirror said she was too upset to talk about the threats. 

The businesswoman was left heartbroken after splitting from the father of her children last year. 

In an interview earlier this month she revealed she was devastated by the relationship breakdown and having to raise her two sons alone.

The mother-of-two said it was always her 'worst nightmare' to be a single parent to Edward, 7, and Frank, 5. 

She said: 'When you get married you think that’s it forever and I was brought up by my mum on her own and it was my worst nightmare to be a single parent.

'I couldn’t think of anything worse and you think I’ll do everything to avoid that but of course it happens.'

She recently split with radio DJ Toby Anstis after two months of dating. 

Miss English quit her £100,000-a-year job with Alan Sugar and was involved in an employment tribunal last year which she lost.

She claimed she was forced to resign from the job after winning the 2010 series because it was 'not a role of substance'.

Lord
 Sugar launched a scathing attack on Miss English after she lost the 
constructive dismissal claim saying 'she picked the wrong person'.

The
 multi-millionaire heralded the tribunal’s decision as a victory against
 Britain’s compensation culture, and vowed to begin a personal crusade 
against ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’.

He
 branded her a ‘money-grabber’ and a ‘chancer’, claiming she had 
launched a sham case against him in the hope he would pay out to avoid 
an embarrassing confrontation in court.

He
 warned that disgruntled employees had been allowed to use the tribunal 
system to effectively blackmail small businesses into settling claims.

He added: ‘This case was a 
sham and a total abuse of a tribunal system which is there to protect 
employees who have been mistreated.

'It is not there to aid those chancing their arm at landing a big payday.

‘I hope that other companies will learn  from this example and also fight off derisory claims.’

On
 her first day at work she claimed she was told: ‘The cameras have 
stopped rolling now… Welcome to the real world, there is no job.’

Miss
 English said she felt ostracised while she worked at Viglen, which 
supplies IT equipment to schools, universities and hospitals.

Far from being mentored by Lord Sugar, she said she only saw him five times while she worked there.

Miss
 English told the tribunal that when she asked Lord Sugar for feedback, 
he replied: ‘The feedback is: “Nice girl, don’t do a lot”.’

During a confrontation over her role, she claimed Lord Sugar told her: ‘I’ve met my obligations to you.

‘I did it for the BBC and the integrity of the show and a bit of my own PR and a bit of yours too. But the fact is that I don’t give a s***.’

Lord Sugar denied her claims and the 
East London employment tribunal dismissed Miss English’s case, saying 
there was no evidence to support her allegation that she was unfairly 
treated.

Contestants in the show were warned Lord Sugar would not be their line manager and that they would rarely see him, the three-strong panel ruled.

She also said the pressure of taking on Lord Sugar resulted in the break down of her marriage to Ray, a plumber. 

At one point she was even forced to sign on the dole and was photographed at the Job Centre inSittingbourne, Kent, last October.

Before winning The Apprentice, Miss English was a bank trader earning £85,000 a year.

Last year she said: 'I can't work. As soon as an employer realises who I am I don't hear back. 

Police have confirmed they are investigating in a relation to an incident against Miss English.

There is no suggestion that Lord Sugar is involved in the dispute which is being investigated by police.

A Kent police spokeswoman said: 'Officers are looking into a report of a dispute. 

'Kent Police was called just after 10am on January 23.'

Stella English was known on The Apprentice as the 'ice maiden' due to her cool demeanour

Stella English was known on The Apprentice as the 'ice maiden' due to her cool demeanour, but wept when she found out she had won a £100,000 contract with Lord Sugar.

The mother-of-two had given up her job in banking after progressing in the sixth series of the BBC show but stressed that all the hard work had been worth it when she beat 15 others to win the talent search.

She was tearful as she thanked Lord Sugar for offering her a job, having been described by the peer as 'well-liked and determined to get on with whatever you're asked to do'.

The 34-year-old, who left school with no qualifications, said on the BBC after winning that the challenge had been 'convincing other people'.

In the interview, conducted in the back of a chauffeur-driven car, she said: 'I'm so excited about the future. It's all been worth it. All the blood, sweat and tears. I've got through to the end and I'm just so happy.'

Months later, the cracks were starting to appear however when she started work at IT firm Viglen, a position she ended up stepping down from before then joining television set-top box company YouView.

Lord Sugar had praised Miss English on the show for showing determination, noting her background and the fact she had fought to educate herself.

Miss English was brought up by relatives on a council estate and then worked her way up the career ladder to an £82,500-a-year job in a Japanese investment bank before applying to take part in The Apprentice.
