Returned: Scott Stewart, 52, of Rochester, New York, returned the statue 

A 52-year-old New York man has returned a marble sculpture he borrowed in the early 1970s to get him through troubled times.

Scott Stewart tells the Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester that as a 9-year-old he spent his days at the Rochester Central Library and was allowed to take home art pieces.

In 1971, he borrowed a small statue of an owl protecting its babies because it symbolized his mother's efforts to care for him and his brother.

The childhood of Scott Stewart, 52, of Rochester was plagued with abuse, but he sought refuge at the downtown library. 

He says the statue brought him peace during tough times over the years.

'The house I lived in was really horrendous and I wanted to surround it with the comfort of the library,' said Stewart. 'I would always take things back, except this one piece. I felt like I couldn't part with it.' 

The then nine-year-old boy spent his days perusing items on the shelves and often borrowed art pieces to adorn his home. 

Though the sculpture wasn't his property, he said the piece brought him strength and peace in turbulent times.

'I hung on to that thing and cherished it,' he said. 'I treated it like it was gold.'

This weekend, Stewart finally returned it to the library.

'I felt like after all these years I was finally able to close the door on that chapter,' he said. 'It was quite exhilarating. ' 

The library didn't fine the Rochester man. A library official says Stewart was looking for a symbol of comfort and he found it at the local library.

The statue was welcomed back with open arms and Stewart's fines were pardoned.
