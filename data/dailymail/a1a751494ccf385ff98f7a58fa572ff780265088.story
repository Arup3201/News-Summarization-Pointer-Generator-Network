This is the mansion built for the family that produced America's first bottled bourbon - and it is on the market for $5.5million.

The historic 17,695-square-foot estate in Harrods Creek, Kentucky has six bedrooms and eight bathrooms as well as a barn, a garden house, greenhouses and a two-bedroom guest house for visitors.

It is the first time it has been on the market since it was built in 1925 for Owsley Brown and is surrounded by several other estates owned by the wealthy family.

Old Forester, the bourbon produced by the Brown family, has been on the shelves for 142 years, making it the longest-running in the world.

It was first bottled in 1873 by George Garvin Brown, a former pharmaceutical salesman. During the Prohibition period between 1920 and 1933, it was one of only 10 brands of alcohol authorized by the American government for lawful production, because of its medical qualities.

It was first sold in pharmacies as a medicinal product and sealed to guard 
against adulteration and substitution of its contents. It was became the first bourbon to be exclusively in sealed bottles as the technique was not readily available at the time.

The seal provided a greater level of assurance of quality compared to other products in the market.

It was also 
popular with doctors and pharmacists who sold the product, and
their approval was touted in advertisements to the general public.

Until 
Prohibition in the United States began in 1920, Old Forester was the 
leading brand produced by Brown's company. Since then, other brands 
acquired by the company such as Jack Daniel's, the 
best-selling whiskey of any kind in the world, have become its leading 
products.
