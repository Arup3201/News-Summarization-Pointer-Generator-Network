The wife of the Sydney terror siege gunman posted a series of hate-filled videos in which she described herself as a terrorist and expressed happiness at the 9/11 and 2002 Bali terror attacks and the Holocaust.

Amirah Droudis, 35, appeared in public Tuesday just hours after her partner Man Haron Monis was shot dead by police to end a 17-hour siege in which he held a score of hostages at a central Sydney cafe. Two of the captives also died.

Droudis reported to Campsie Police Station in southwestern Sydney, as required under conditions of her bail for the alleged murder of Monis' ex-wife, Noleen Hayson Pal, who was stabbed multiple times and set alight in April 2013. Monis was also charged in connection to the murder.

Amirah Droudis reported to a police station in southwestern Sydney on Tuesday, just hours after the siege involving her husband Man Haron Monis ended with two hostages and the gunman dead

Droudis, who attended the police with an unidentified child, is free on bail on charges of murdering Monis' ex-wife in 2013. Monis was charged with being an accessory in the killing 

Four years before the killing, a woman believed to be Droudis posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God's will. The videos bear the address of Monis' web site.

'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab.

In another video post, the women describes acts including the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the Al Qaeda-linked Bali bombings as 'acts of God.'

'Yes, we are happy about the punishment of September 11. Yes, we are happy about the punishment in Bali. Yes, we are happy about the punishment of the Holocaust and any other punishment that God sends to us.'

In another online video, the appeared to condone rape, saying 'It is not fair if we condemn the rapist without condemning the one who has encouraged the rape.'

Droudis' brother John Aspros confirmed to Daily Mail Australia today that she and Monis were married.

Daily Mail Australia understands Droudis, from a Greek family in Belmore, in south-western Sydney, changed her name from Anastasia to Amirah after meeting Monis. 

The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid. However, at around the same time Monis and Droudis were charged with sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan.

The relatives said the letters accused the troops of killing innocent children, among other things. Monis and Droudis were eventually convicted in that case and sentenced to community service.

In addition to the murder accessory charge, Monis was facing more than 40 sexual assault charges involved seven women he allegedly lured by posing as a 'spiritual adviser'. Droudis was not involved in that case.

Monis' first wife was found stabbed 18 times and with her body set alight in the stairwell of her apartment building in April 2013. Droudis was charged with her murder and Monis  was charged with accessory before and after the fact. Both told a court they denied the allegations.

Monis was initially remanded in custody, but in December 2013 he applied for bail and was released. In April this year, Monis was charged with sexual assault and again was granted bail. At a court appearance in October in the sexual assault case, 40 more charges were laid against Monis, and again he was released on bail.

In May this year, the New South Wales state government introduced changes to bail laws that removed long-standings provisions that meant bail was denied in cases involving serious cries such as murder and manslaughter.

'I am a terrorist': A woman believed to Amirah Droudis posted a series of videos in 2009 in which she described herself as a terrorist and said acts of terrorism including the 9/11 attacks and the Bali bombings, as well as the Holocaust, were acts of God

The videos included links to the web site of Man Haron Monis, a self-described sheik, and included text identifying the speaker as 'Sister Amirah'

Under the new laws, judges were required to assess whether a suspect posed an 'unacceptable risk' of reoffending.

Monis and Droudis were granted bail under the new laws by Magistrate Joan Baptie, on conditions including that they report regularly to police, surrender their passports and stay away from prosecution witnesses, the Herald reported. Monis was ordered to pay a $10,000 surety, and Droudis $100,000.

That Monis was free on bail and able to get a firearm, storm the Lindt cafe in central Sydney and take 17 people hostage in Monday's dramatic siege has triggered outrage.

New South Wales Attorney General Brad Hazzard conceded on Tuesday that Monis fell through the cracks of the legal system and said the government had already moved to toughen the bail laws.

'We are asking state agencies and federal agencies to look very closely at how this offender slipped through the cracks,' Mr Hazzard told reporters. 'How did this offender not come to the attention of state and federal agencies for more urgent action.'

Droudis attended Campsie Police Station in Sydney's southwest dressed in a knitted hat and dark sunglasses, and ignored media requests to answer questions

He said changes to bail laws due to come into effect at the end of January would have made it 'very unlikely' Monis would have been released. 

Family members of Ms Pal were today outraged by Monis' freedom. Pal's so-called 'god brother' reportedly posted a series of raging comments about the matter to Facebook.

'Thats systems tree f***ed up but I'm still happy he.died... F***n lucky tey got u before we did now. rest in hell f***n asshole.'

A police spokesman refused to comment on Droudis's visit to the police station. She refused to speak to Daily Mail Australia, slamming the door of her vehicle shut without responding to questions.

A Change.org petition started after the siege ended demanding the bail laws be tightened drew thousands of supporters within a few hours.

Police on Tuesday raided the Droudis family home in Belmore and carted away paper bags and containers of what is believed could be evidence related to Monis activities leading up the siege.

Police would only say the Critical Incident Unit was executing a search warrant.
