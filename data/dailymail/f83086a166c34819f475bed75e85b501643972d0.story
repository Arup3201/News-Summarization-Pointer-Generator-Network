Germany's latest masterplan for saving the euro involves a huge transfer of power to Brussels by countries using the endangered currency.

But Britain is seen as a major stumbling block for his plans as the divide between Britain and the continent becomes wider by the day.

Finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says he is 'determined' to end the euro crisis once and for all. The antidote - giving the EU far greater powers over the national budgets of individual states.

Man with a plan: Germany's Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble (left) speaks with Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Kittirat Na Ranong (right) in Bangkok yesterday. He has proposed giving the EU far greater powers over the national budgets of individual states

'We now need to go a major step in the direction of a fiscal union that will go beyond the proposals made so far,' Mr Schaeuble said on Monday night during a flight back to Berlin from a tour of Asia.

Mr Schaeuble said he wants to concentrate on far-reaching reforms that include:

It is understood that Mr Schaeuble discussed his plans with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, Euro Group President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi before he went public with them and has received the green light.

Mr Schaeuble's proposals look like being discussed at the EU summit in Brussels this Thursday and Friday. Enacting them will require changes to the EU treaties signed by member states.

He wants to convene an EU convention by the end of the year in which EU members work on a draft that would then have to be ratified by the 27 member states. Observers say it would take at least 18 months, and probably longer, before they can be implemented.

'That, of course, assumes that Britain, 
which is not a member of the euro zone and which often opposes steps 
towards closer European integration, will play along,' said German 
magazine Der Spiegel.

Any resemblance? Angela Merkel this week compared David Cameron and the British to the irascible stars of The Muppet Show Waldorf and Statler

'If it doesn't, it won't be possible to change the EU treaties. Eurozone governments would have to come up with a separate treaty as they recently did with the fiscal pact.

'The British should not underestimate Schaeuble's determination to solve the euro crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel backs the proposals.'

On Monday this week the same magazine said that Mrs Merkel is actively plotting for an EU without Britain in it and thinks David Cameron and the British are the Statler and Waldorf of Europe, it was claimed yesterday.

The German chancellor apparently likens the Prime Minister to the grumpy Muppets who constantly grumble from the sidelines.

Making the European commissioner for economic and currency affairs equally as powerful as the commissioner for competition

Forcing individual member states to hand over part of their budget sovereignty to Brussels, allowing the currency affairs commissioner to exercise veto power over national budgets. This would give Brussels to the right to send back budgets to countries if it didn't like the look of them.

@highlight

Creating 'more democracy' by getting the European Parliament involved in 'all important processes' much sooner than at present. He also wants to change the voting structure - Britain, for instance, would be excluded from voting on issues concerning the euro because it doesn't use it.
