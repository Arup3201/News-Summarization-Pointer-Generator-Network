Three quarters of the public believe there will be a further terrorist attack on Britain - while almost one in 10 fear for their family and friends, a poll has revealed today.

The revelation comes after the Prime Minister unveiled a host of anti-terror measures to target extremists in the UK yesterday. He said a terror attack on Britain was now ‘highly likely’ after the threat level was raised to ‘severe’ last week.

But Mr Cameron’s proposed crackdown was thrown into disarray last night after the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted one of the key proposals could be illegal.

Threee quarters of the public now believe a terror attack on the UK is 'likely', amid evidence of growing alarm over the extremist threat to Britain

While many people believe the threat to Britain has not changed, almost half the public believe it has increased

Speaking to the BBC this morning, Mr Clegg repeatedly sidestepped questions over whether stripping suspected British jihadis of their citizenship was now effectively dead in the water after blocking the proposal over fears it would break international law.

He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: ‘It's not a question of whether I will or won't let it happen. We are not going to do something which flouts international and domestic law. We must act within the law.’

Mr Clegg’s opposition to the measure risks allowing the Conservatives to claim they are being held back from passing tougher anti-terror measures.

But the Deputy Prime Minister insisted the Government ‘can square the circle’ of filling the gaps in Britain's terror laws while remaining within international obligations.

It comes amid growing concern in Britain over the threat posed by Islamist extremists fighting for ISIS.

A new poll released this morning for the Times newspaper revealed Britons believe the threat of terrorism has increased over the past five years.

The YouGov survey found 45 per cent felt more endangered than before – with just 13 per cent saying the threat has decreased. A further four in 10 said the threat had not changed.

Britons travelling abroad are ever more in danger, the public now believe. Some 67 per cent believe the threat posed to Britons overseas has increased. Just five per cent think this is not the case.

David Cameron yesterday announced a raft of new measures to tackle the extremist threat to Britain, but the Lib Dems have raised concerns over whether one key proposal could be illegal

Nick Clegg visited a school in London this morning to promote the signature Lib Dem policy to provide free school meals for under sevens. The Deputy Prime Minister is at loggerheads with Mr Cameron  over plans to tighten restrictions on extremists

The public are overwhelmingly of the view that a terrorist attack on Britain is likely.

Some 74 per cent think it likely there will be further attack on British citizens – compared to just 15 per cent who think it unlikely.

Almost one in 10 Britons also believe there is a ‘good chance’ that their circle of friends and family are at risk.
