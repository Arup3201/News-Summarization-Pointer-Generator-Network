Javier Hernandez will finally have his chance to impress new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal after joining up with the team's tour of America.

The Mexican international reported back for pre-season training later than most of his club team-mates after his country reached the World Cup second round last month.

Hernandez's arrival in Los Angeles was announced by the club's official Twitter account on Wednesday ahead of their opening pre-season game against LA Galaxy.

United face their MLS opponents at the Rose Bowl Stadium on Thursday before heading to Denver, Washington DC and Detroit during their pre-season tour against Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid.

The Red Devils have spent heavily already this summer on Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, and the Old Trafford outfit are expected to splash the cash some more as they look to return to the top of English football - after finishing a disappointing seventh in the league last season.

Speaking ahead of Hernandez's arrival, Van Gaal reiterated his intention to give all his squad a chance to prove themselves in the North American tour - including the Mexican.

Asked directly at a press conference whether he would keep Chicharito, van Gaal replied: 'I have to see if he performs how I want.

'Now I can only see what he has showed under the guidance of another coach.

'He will arrive and I will meet him, we will train and after that he will perform in a match and then I can say something about that.'

Fair assessor: Louis van Gaal says he'll allow Hernadez time to show him his skills during the USA tour
