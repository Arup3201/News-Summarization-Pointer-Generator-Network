Brian Thompson-McKinnon got a lucky teacher’s note on Friday
in Nahant, MA. when his mother wrote him a playful letter excusing him from school early in
order to see the Red Sox play.The team played game 1 of the American League
Division Series (ALDS) at Fenway Park in Boston.

According to Brian’s mother, her son has ‘Red Sox fever’ and
the only cure for the illness spreading all over Boston is to go directly to
Fenway Park.

‘His teacher laughed hysterically at school,’ said Brian’s
mother Kerri Mckinnon.

Kerri McKinnon and her son Brian are huge Red Sox fans, so much so that Brian got to skip out from school

Brian’s teacher, Jude Shannon, is having knee surgery soon. ‘I
just wanted to bring some laughter to her day,’ McKinnon said of writing the
humorous note.

According to Brian’s mother, the Red Sox contributed to some
of Ryan’s education.  His mother said
Brian, ‘learned to count by watching the Red Sox.’

Even though Brian was excused from school early he didn’t
miss much. According to Brian’s mother he only skipped recess and choice time
which on Fridays is either chess or drawing.

Kerri takes her son’s education seriously and is a member of
the school committee in Nahant, Massachusetts.

Apparently, ‘Red Sox fever’ is good for the team’s playing
ability. The Red Sox won the game against Tampa Bay on Friday 12-7.

If they hadn't won, Brian's teacher was to expect 'grumpy child syndrome on Monday,' according to the note.

The McKinnon family is also at tonight's game supporting their favorite Boston Team.
