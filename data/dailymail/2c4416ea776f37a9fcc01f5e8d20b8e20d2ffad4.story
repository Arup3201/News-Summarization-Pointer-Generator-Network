Former AFL star Ben Cousins has reportedly been arrested overnight for reckless driving and refusing to give a breath test after a short police chase.

The West Australian reported the 36-year-old was allegedly driving recklessly through the Perth suburb of Bicton  around 10.30pm on Wednesday night when police attempted to pull him over.

He then apparently refused to stop while travelling along Preston Point Road, and instead kept driving at a low speed while running red lights.
