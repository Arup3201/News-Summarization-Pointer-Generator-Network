Reading have announced that an Asian consortium has completed a takeover at the Madejski Stadium.

Sir John Madejski, who has been at the helm in Berkshire since 1990, revealed in a statement on the club's website that everything was finalised to end months of uncertainty, which saw majority shareholder Anton Zingarevich leave the board in June.

'I am delighted to announce that, following confirmation from the Football League, our new Asian consortium partners are now in place at Reading Football Club,' he said on the club's official website. 

Sir John Madejski will remain as co-Chairman of Reading, with Khunying Sasima Srivikorn as Co-Chairwoman

'After months of tireless hard work and a lot of speculation, I am very pleased to say that Reading Football Club's future has been resolved.'

Zingarevich, who purchased a 51 per cent stake in Reading in May 2012, pulled out of a deal to complete a full takeover shortly after the Royals were relegated from the Premier League in 2013 and his departure from the board was announced earlier this summer.

During that time the club has been searching for fresh investment, but that hunt is now over after Khun Narin Niruttinanon bought a 50 per cent stake, Khunying Sasima Srivikorn took 25 per cent and Khun Sumrith Thanakarnjanasuth bought the remaining 25 per cent.

Madejski also confirmed that he will remain at the Royals in a co-chairman capacity, with Khunying Sasima taking up the role of co-chairwoman, while chief executive Nigel Howe and non-executive director Ian Wood-Smith will also stay at the Sky Bet Championship club.

Irish forward Cox scored the opening goal for Reading, it was the Irish forward's third goal of the season 

'I cannot speak highly enough of our new partners from the time we have spent together so far,' Madejski said.

'They have shown great professionalism, perseverance, patience and diligence and, on a personal level, our relationship is excellent and long may that continue.'

The 73-year-old described how his tenure at Reading had already given him some of the 'greatest memories of my life' and he is hoping for many more at the Royals after a strong start to the season has seen Nigel Adkins' side climb to sixth.

'We have started this season well, which is testament to all of our staff and players here,' he added. 'There are reasons to be optimistic on many fronts, and we now move forward with a renewed vigour and high hopes for a bright new future.'
