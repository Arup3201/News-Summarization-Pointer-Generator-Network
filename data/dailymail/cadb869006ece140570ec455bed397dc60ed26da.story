Rihanna plans to buy a football club in the UK following her excitement at this summer's World Cup.

The pop princess enjoyed the tournament in Brazil so much she has set her sights on establishing a football academy in her native Bardbados before branching out into ownership.

A source said: 'At first we thought Rihanna's desire to be involved with soccer on a business level would soon blow over. We figured she was still on a high from the World Cup.

'But
 now it's becoming clear she really is serious. She's talking about 
setting up a football academy in her native Barbados. Then her big dream
 is to be involved with a UK club.'

While
 Rihanna has designs on getting her hands on a British team, the 
26-year-old beauty has also reportedly been considering options closer 
to her Tinsel Town home.

A
 source told the Daily Star: 'Britain is like a second home to her, 
although she's also hinted she may do something with an LA team.'

During the 
summer's World Cup, Rihanna made quite a name for herself with her 
irreverent style of football commentary on Twitter.

And
 towards the end of the tournament, the singer made the long trek down 
to the South American nation so she could take in some of the action 
live.

Rihanna
 tweeted her elation when her favourites Germany beat Argentina in the 
final, going on to become champions of the prestigious tournament.

She then shared several images of herself posing with players from the victorious team - and holding the coveted World Cup.

In
 the midst of the excitement she tweeted: 'I touched the cup, held the 
cup, kissed the cup, took a selfie wit the cup!!! I meeeaan...... what 
is YO bucket list looking like bruh?'

Rihanna
 had once stated that she was a fan of Liverpool, although it's now been
 reported that she's currently receiving advice from her pal, Chelsea 
player Didier Drogba.
