Firefighters mounted a dramatic rescue to save a terrified tabby cat stuck at the top of a 40ft telegraph pole.

In typical feline fashion, Tigger had nimbly climbed the tall post but became too frightened to get down again.

The elderly cat's owner contacted emergency services, who were forced to call for back-up and an extra-long ladder to save the petrified pet.

Scaredy-cat: The petrified pet was stuck on the post until a fireman climbed a ladder and gently lifted her down

Concern: A crowd gathers as at least five firefighters arrive with a truck and equipment to help the animal

Within ten minutes of the call, a fireman had climbed the ladder, gathered the cat tenderly into his arms and returned her to her owner.

She had been up there for more than an hour in total.

Tigger was first spotted perching on top of the pole in Sudbury town centre, Suffolk.

A crowd of concerned shoppers gathered outside North Street Tavern to watch the rescue.

Witness Roger Griffiths, who photographed the episode, said: 'The poor little thing was up incredibly high.

Paw thing! RSPCA were also called before relieved firefighters returned Tigger to her worried owner

Happy ending: Tigger is carried down the ladder and set on the ground, her traumatic episode at an end

'I donâ€™t know how she got there in the first place. The fireman just had to grab her and he looked relieved.'

A spokesman for Suffolk Fire and rescue Service said: 'We were called by the owner of an elderly cat who had got itself stuck at the top of a telegraph pole in Sudbury.

'In these circumstances, we always ask for the RSPCA to be contacted first and for them to assess if we are needed.

'On this occasion they requested our attendance and so a local appliance was sent to rescue the cat. They were able to get the cat down from the pole and return it to its worried owner within ten minutes of the call.'
