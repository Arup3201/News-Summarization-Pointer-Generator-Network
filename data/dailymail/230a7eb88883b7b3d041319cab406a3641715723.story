An assassination attempt on Afghan President Hamid Karzai by a group including one of his own bodyguards has been foiled, it was claimed today.

As well as Karzai's protection officer, college students and a professor all with links to al-Qaida and the country's violent Haqqani militant group have been arrested in capital Kabul.

Intelligence service spokesman Latifullah Mashal said today that the group was recruited by two Arab nationals in neighbouring Pakistan.

Afghan officials have been increasingly vocal in publicly accusing the country and its spy agency of supporting militants.

Yesterday they claimed that Pakistani officials had advance knowledge of the September 20 assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.

Pakistan has vehemently denied any of the claims.

A senior commander of an insurgent group which is linked to the Taliban has been killed following an air strike by Nato-led forces fighting in Afghanistan.

Dilawar, who was only known by one name, was a member of the Haqqani network and was killed along with two of his associates in eastern Khost province, near the Pakistan border.

His death is 'another significant loss for the insurgent group,' the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said in a statement today.

He was a 'principal subordinate' to Haji Mali Khan, who Nato captured last week and said at the time was the top Haqqani commander for Afghanistan.

According to ISAF, Dilawar's responsibilities included coordinating attacks on Afghan forces and arranging weapons deliveries.

Nato also said that Dilawar helped foreign militants move into Afghanistan and had links with both Al Qaeda and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.

The Afghan and coalition force has conducted more than 530 operations to disrupt Haqqani network activities in eastern Afghanistan so far this year.

Strong claims: The outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen has said previously that the Haqqani network has links to Pakistan's spy agency

Around 1,400 suspected Haqqani 
insurgents had been captured, 100 since the start of October alone, and 
20 network leaders killed.

The Haqqani network is one of three Taliban-allied insurgent factions fighting in Afghanistan.

Perhaps the most feared, it is thought to
have introduced suicide bombing to the country and be behind many 
high-profile attacks.

It has sworn allegiance to the Taliban, but has long been suspected of also having ties to Pakistan's spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate.

The outgoing chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, testified before the U.S. Senate after an attack on the U.S. embassy and Nato headquarters in Kabul, believed to be the work of the group, that the Haqqani network was a 'veritable arm' of the ISI.

Sirajuddin Haqqani, who heads the group, says it no longer needs sanctuaries in Pakistan and it feels safe operating in Afghanistan.
