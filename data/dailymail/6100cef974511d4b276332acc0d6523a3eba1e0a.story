Manchester United have splashed out £58.8million on Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera in a statement of their intent to return to the top of the Premier League.

United will complete the £30m transfer of England left-back Shaw on Friday just 24 hours after wrapping up the £28.8m purchase of Athletic Bilbao midfielder Herrera.

Vice executive chairman Ed Woodward has signalled the near £60m outlay in a bid to wrap up the signings quickly and avoid a repeat of last summer's transfer sagas and does not intend to stop there, with at least two more signings in the pipeline.

Although Southampton were chasing a massive £40m for 18-year-old Shaw, United have struck a deal for £30m and he will undergo his medical at Carrington today before signing a five year deal.

Stylish midfielder Herrera officially completed his move yesterday despite a late attempt from Bilbao to say they had rejected United's offer of the player's buyout clause.

Herrera posed with Sir Bobby Charlton and declared: 'It is a dream come true. I have played at Old Trafford for Athletic and it was one of the highlights of my career.

'Having arrived on Tuesday I'm excited to now be living in Manchester and I can't wait for my first game in United's famous red shirt.'

Bilbao, meanwhile, are considering a cheeky approach for Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta as Herrera's replacement.

'Louis van Gaal is one of the best managers in the world and, for me, I am lucky to be working with him. I want to learn a lot of things and I can't wait to play with Van Gaal, my new team-mates and for Manchester United.'

Herrera arrives at United with the advantage of already being friends with David De Gea and Juan Mata, two men he got to know well while playing for Spain’s Under-21s. Importantly, the diminutive playmaker believes their kinship will help him settle in.

'I know they are very happy,' he explains. 'I was talking to them and they told me that this is the biggest club in the world and that we have a very good squad. We are very good friends and I am sure that they will help me to adapt and get to know the club.'
