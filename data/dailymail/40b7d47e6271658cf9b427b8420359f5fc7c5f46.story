Danny and will.i.am's war of words gets heated

will.i.am defies critics by live tweeting his critiques as he says them

Most contestants on talent shows are happy to be told they managed to perform a song just as well as the original artist.

But Bo Bruce impressed so much with her rendition of Rihanna's Love The Way You Lie that will.i.am told her she'd sung it 'a million times better' than the Grammy-winner.

The 27-year-old Team Danny contestant said before hitting the stage on tonight's episode of The Voice that she was determined to try a stronger, more powerful style than previous performances.

'Bo... woah!' Bo Bruce impressed the judges on Saturdays night's The Voice with her rendition of Rihanna's Love The Way You Lie

And she pulled it off, getting all four of the coaches on their feet applauding.

'I love the way you lie, the way you sing, the way you move around the stage, everything,' said Bo's coach Danny afterwards.

'The way you sing is the sort of thing I like,' said will. 'You sang that a million times better than Rihanna. Bo... woah!'

High praise: will.i.am told the 27-year-old that she sang the track 'a million times better than Rihanna'

'You are someone that makes this whole competition versatile' added Jessie J.

Saturday's episode got off to a shaky start for Jessie's team performance.

The Price Tag singer halted proceedings, saying her mic pack was not turned on.

'I apologise to everyone at home,' she said, 'but this is live TV, and Team Jessie do it right, I want it absolutely perfect.'

Whoops! Jessie J halted her team's group performance when her mic pack was switched off

'Sorry to everyone at home': The singer apologised for the technical glitch

First up of the solo performances was Max, who sang Black Horse and the Cherry Tree.

The singer was using a loop pedal for his performance, and he spoke of his nerves beforehand of messing it up, but it went off without a hitch.

'It was a great performance, but these are almost the finals and the song selection wasn't the greatest,' said will.i.am.

Off and running: The group started again and got through the performance

Risk taker: Max, for Team Danny, impressed with his performance using a loop pedal

Danny quizzed will on what he would have sung (in the first of a number of clashes between the two throughout the show), but will just replied: 'I wouldn't have sung that song.'

Jessie agreed: 'It was such a risk and I applaud you for doing it. With the song choice, I felt you could have spun it differently.'

'As far as I'm concerned, Max entertained me,' said Tom. 'I loved it. As an artist to take the path you know but sometimes you have to go off road. And Max went off road tonight. I loved it.'

'Getting stronger': Cassius was nervous but won the coaches over with his rendition of Adele's Turning Tables

Next up was Cassius, who took on Adele's Turning Tables.

Jessie was full of praise for her nervous contestant, but added: 'I would have liked to have seen you turn around and face us a bit more, but other than that I loved it.'

'You seem stronger and stronger,' said Tom. 'To take a well known song like that, more power to you.'

'I don't know if it was strong enough to get you through to the next round,' said Danny.

'I wanted to heat things up': Vince, from Team Jessie, put a reggae spin on My Love Is Your Love by Whitney Houston

'Out of all the singers on Team Jessie, you're my favourite,' said will.

Vince, from Team Jessie, was next, putting a reggae spin on My Love Is Your Love by Whitney Houston.

'You know what I love about Vince, he came to me with the production for that, how he dressed, the lighting, the staging,' said Jessie. 'It's a pleasure to work with someone like that.'

'He doesn't sound like anybody else, he sounds like himself,' said Tom. 'He has such a great vocal range.'

Teen dream: 17-year-old Aleks performed Jack Johnson's Better Together

Taking it easy: The teen said he wanted his performance to be a chilled-out break in between all the powerful voices throughout the night

'I love your vocal, you could sing the phone book and it would sound good,' added Danny.

Will defied critics of his tweeting during the live shows, by giving his critique of Vince 'double time' - tweeting his opinion as he spoke it. 'Ring the alarm. Vince is the bomb.com,' he said.

Aleks was next up for Team Danny. Danny had suggested the singer perform Jet's Are You Gonna Be My Girl, but the 17-year-old was adamant that he sing something more his style, so they settled on Better Together by Jack Johnson.

'That is the sound of the whole of the UK's heart breaking,' said Danny afterwards.

Rock chick: Becky had the audience out of their seats with Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes

'I love your style,' said will, doing an impression of the singer's bashful onstage presence. 'But I want Danny to push you, its the same thing every week. If you were on my team I would have done something different.'

Jessie agreed with will, saying she would have pushed the teen with a different style of song.'

The teen was defiant, telling the coaches that he wanted his performance to be a chilled out break in between all of the powerful voices in the competition.

Becky had the audience out of their seats with Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes.

Support: Becky was concerned that she'd messed up the performance and needed a hug from her coach afterwards

Wearing a provocative outfit of leather shorts, ripped stockings, an army jacket and wild crimped hair, she made her way through the audience and danced with the judges.

Becky was concerned that she'd messed up the performance and needed a hug from her coach afterwards.

'She's on fire this girl,' said Tom. 'She takes it to the extreme. So much so that I get a little concerned sometimes that you may hurt your voice. You need to respect it, you only have one voice.'

Lost love: David sang She Will Be Loved, revealing that he was singing for a particular girl

War of words: A spat between will and Danny had to be broken up by Jessie

Making fun of Tom's tendency to name-drop, Danny joked: 'I've dueted with a lot of people in my time, Tom, Jessie J, will.i.am... and I'd love to duet with you.'

David sang She Will Be loved, revealing that he had a particular unrequited love in mind that he would be singing for.

'You've taken every song I've thrown at you,' said Danny, 'and you've done me proud.'

'It was cool,' said will. When pressed for something more constructive by the other coaches, he said, 'I don't want to be the one going in on them every time.' When pressured, he admitted: 'I don't think you guys are taking it seriously for what stage we are in the competition. You guys are like "la la la"... the song choice isn't good enough.'

Powerful: Toni sang Elton John's Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word

'You think that's not a good song? You think your team were better?' challenged Danny.

A spat broke out between the coaches about whose team were better, with Jessie having to step in, telling Danny and will that they needed to give constructive criticism to the individual artists, and not look critique from the perspective of their teams.

Last up, Toni sang Elton John's Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word.

'Double time': will defied critics by tweeting his critiques as he said them on the live show

'I loved it, you moved me,' said Tom. 'You have so much emotion when you sing, and you use it to your advantage, you don't let it crumble you.'

Team Danny topped off the evening with their group performance of Gotye's Somebody That I Used To Know.
