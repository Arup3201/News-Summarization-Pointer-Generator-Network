This stunning neo-Tudor mansion has just changed hands among the rich and powerful of Silicon Valley tech scene for $25million - after shedding almost half its value since 2008.

The so-called Morgan Estate, built in 1914, is a lavish palace that boasts solid marble bathtubs, a palatial ballroom, a cavernous wine cellar - and even a secret speakeasy hidden behind a movable shelf in the library.

Despite its Classical statuary, elegant carpentry and enormous scale, the 30,000sq ft home of venture capitalist Kelly Porter failed to appeal to the multi-millionaires of Los Altos, California, at its original market price of $45million.

Palatial: The so-called Morgan Estate in Los Altos, California, has finally been sold for $25million - after first going on sale for $45million

Vast: The neo-Tudor facade fronts the enormous seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house which is crammed with marble statues and taxidermy

Ornate: The gilded ceiling in this ballroom features lavish paintings, lit by heavy chandeliers. Two crushed velvet couches sit in the vast room, which has a staircase, balcony and heavy wooden door

Decadent: This bathroom features a solid marble tub, right, as well as marbled floors and walls

Porter had to cut the price to $36million, to $27million and finally to $25million before finalizing the sale, Business Insider reported. It will now be handed over to Nora Lacey, president of the Cell Marque Corporation, a biotech firm.

Arthur Sharif, the realtor who sold the property, said that in the end Porter fended off several other potential buyers, including a super-rich couple who work for Facebook, and an undisclosed buyer who wanted the house next door, too.

The home, crammed with marble statues, stuffed hunting trophies, gilded ceilings and ornate period furniture, was built by Stanford University trustee Percy Morgan in the early twentieth century, and still bears his name.

Rampant: This hallway has a Tudor-style carpeted wooden staircase, overseen by an enormous gilded chandelier. It also has a grandfather clock

Livery: The library features extensive bookshelves and a reading bench by the window. The couch has soft furnishings decorated with a coat of arms - and one of the bookshelves moves aside to reveal the way to a bar

Secret drinking hole: This covert speakeasy is accessible from a moving panel above, and features room for a handsome drinks cabinet - and is lit by bulbs in torch holders shaped like arms

More space: This bedroom, one of seven in the huge house, has a more modern design, with a mostly bare white wall and contemporary pictures of plantlife
