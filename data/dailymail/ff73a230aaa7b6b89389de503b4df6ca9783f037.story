Viewers tuning in to enjoy daytime TV today accused ITV's This Morning of 'crossing the line', after a live vasectomy was broadcast.

To mark tomorrow's World Vasectomy Day and to dispel the myths and worries around the procedure, a brave patient was filmed as he went under the knife.

Volunteering for the role, the patient, named only as James, explained he was already a father of five. 

He told viewers: 'My wife and I have five children and we love them dearly, but we don't want any more surprises.' 

This Morning viewers were shocked to tune in and see a man having a vasectomy live on air

Presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden express their own discomfort at the procedure, as they aimed to dispel the myths and worries surrounding vasectomies ahead of World Vasectomy Day tomorrow

Dr Jon Unwin, a Gloucestershire GP, performed the procedure, while This Morning's resident GP Dr Dawn Harper observed.

In the studio, presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden looked visibly uncomfortable at the graphic procedure taking place before their eyes.

The camera left little to the imagination, zooming right in to the patient's genitalia and graphically showing them being operated on, as Dr Unwin described the procedure.

The feature comes after the programme's resident GP Dr Dawn Harper had a smear test live on air. 

And earlier this year, a couple drank their own urine on the show to try and advocate the health benefits. 

Speaking before the procedure, James, who was given local anaesthetic, added: 'For us this is a fail safe option.

'We haven't considered any other form of contraception. Now our family's complete this is the option for us.

'I have a bit of anxiety about the procedure but we have got to move forward and so unfortunately I have to go through it.'

His wife, Carolyn, added: 'We definitely don't want any more children.

'I don't have any nerves about it. It is just something he has to have done.' 

But having watched the eye-watering segment, some This Morning viewers took to Twitter to express their shock. 

But viewers tuning in expressed their shock, with @jaschambers1 accusing the show of going too far

@MrHairyBrit accused the show's images of men's genitalia of ruining his breakfast

Another viewer, @pipbrowyn1, said the segment on the show had ruined her appetite

While @perla_illy told her followers the live operation had left her feeling sick 

And @stuartaelmore tweeted 'a warning would have been nice'

@jaschambers1 accused the show, which has recently aired a live smear test and a breast examination on air, of going too far.

She tweeted: 'oh my lord, this morning has crossed the line, no one wants to see a vasectomy live.'

Another viewer @pipbrowyn wrote: 'Um #thismorning cheers for showing a live vasectomy. That's my appetite gone for the next 1,000 years.'

And @perla_illy added: 'I can't believe I'm actually watching a live vasectomy on itv this morning... literally finished my breakfast an about to see it again (sic).'

Earlier in the segment, Dr Harper had explained the 'simple' procedure is carried out under a local anaesthetic, but warned it is considered irreversible.

'Vasectomy is really just dividing and tying the vas, the tubes where sperm get out from the testicles to the ejaculate,' she said.   

A vasectomy is a minor operation which is relatively painless and carried under local anaesthetic.

The tubes that carry sperm from a man's testicles to the penis are cut, blocked or sealed with heat.

The procedure can be carried out at your local GP surgery, in hospital as a day patient, at a sexual health clinic or a private clinic.

There are two types of vasectomy. The tradtitional procedure, a conventional vasectomy, involves making two small incisions in the scrotum using a scalpel.

The 1cm incisions allow the surgeon to access the tubes, known as vas deferens.

Each tube is cut and a small section is removed.

The ends of the tubes are then closed, either by tying them or sealing them using a high heat.

The incisions are stitched using dissolvable stitches that disappear within about a week.

The other type, a no-scapel vasectomy, is a newer technique.

The doctor will feel for the vas deferens under the skin and hold them in place using a small clamp.

A special instrument is then used to make a tiny puncture hole in the skin of the scrotum.

A small pair of forceps is used to open the hole, allowing the surgeon access to the vans deferens without the need to cut the skin using a scalpel.

The tubes are then closed in the same way as in the conventional method. 

@probnotbob joked: 'I just watched a live vasectomy on daytime TV and this is why I work'

@liamhulmes_ joined the viewers shocked at the segment, adding 'I can't believe they're showing a live vasectomy on this morning'

'The idea is that by cutting and tying it off, sperm can't get into the ejaculate.

'You will still produce ejaculate because sperm is just a tiny part of it.'

Amanda raised the question on the minds of most thinking about the technicalities of a vasectomy, asking Dr Dawn 'where the sperm goes'.

'The sperm can't go beyond the tied vas, and so it is reabsorbed by the body,' Dr Dawn said.

'It is a natural process, but is something that can cause concern. But it doesn't cause any problems.'

She said the procedure has a high success rate, with just one in 2,000 failing.

'One of the reasons we cut and tie the tubes is to prevent the tubes reattaching,' she said. 

And she warned the procedure is considered irreversible on the NHS, while it is possible in some cases to perform reversals, though they are generally done privately. 

A This Morning's spokesperson said: 'Today's live vasectomy, on the eve of World Vasectomy Day, aimed to dispel myths and fears about this operation. 

'The item also featured expert advice from leading doctors about this procedure and other methods of contraception. 

'Warnings were given at the start of the item, and many positive comments were received.' 

A spokesman for the TV watchdog Ofcom said they have received one complaint relating to the live segment earlier today.

He said: 'We will assess this complaint before deciding whether to investigate.' 

@allanfoy questioned the decision to air the live op as many will have been tucking into a morning coffee
