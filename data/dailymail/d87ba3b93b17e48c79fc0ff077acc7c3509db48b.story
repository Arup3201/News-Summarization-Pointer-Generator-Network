A controversial bookstore in Sydney's west has closed its doors as its owner Wissam Haddad - a school friend of convicted Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf - claims 90 per cent of his clientele gets harassed by ASIO.

Mr Haddad said he made the choice to shutdown Bankstown's Al Risalah Centre due to financial reasons.

His decision coincided with the federal government announcement on Friday to up the national terror alert level from medium to high.

Earlier this year, the fireband owner caused controversy after he defended Sharrouf when the terrorist posted a photo of a child - believed to be his son - holding up a severed head on social media.

Mr Haddad told the ABC the new anti-terror laws touted by the government would target innocent Australian Muslims.

'Ninety per cent of people who come here have been visited by ASIO,' he said.

'My family members have been hassled and the family members of people who are regulars have also been hassled.'

Mr Haddad - who is a supporter of terrorist organisation Islamic State - said ASIO had quizzed his associates about how the Al Risalah Centre was funded, what was taught and if he was connected to anyone overseas.

He caused a stir last month when he defended his friend, Khaled Sharrouf, saying he did not know why there was so much controversy surrounding a picture of the convicted terrorist posted on his Twitter showing his son holding a severed head.

'I don't see what the big concern is getting children to hold up severed heads,' Mr Haddad told The Daily Telegraph.

Just days later, Mr Haddad denounced the Australian flag and said he preferred the Shahada flag, which is same one used by Islamic State.

'I'm not comfortable personally holding the flag because this flag does not represent me as a Muslim. My flag is the flag of Allah. That's my flag,' Mr Haddad told The Daily Telegraph.

Sharrouf also uploaded a photo of him and his sons dressed in identical camouflage fatigues wielding machine guns
