Four Britons are feared dead after the yacht they were sailing from the Caribbean back to the UK capsized in the Atlantic Ocean.

The crew of the 40ft yacht were returning from one of the world’s most prestigious regattas when they went missing in treacherous conditions.

They were last heard from on Friday morning, when water had started to leak into the boat in 20ft stormy seas. After a two-day search operation, rescuers yesterday gave up hope of finding them.

Andrew Bridge, 21, James Male, 23, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56, had been sailing the Cheeki Rafiki, a Beneteau performance racer yacht, back from the Antigua Sailing Week regatta.

James Male, 23, from Southampton, was another sailor on board the yacht, which lost contact with charter firm Stormforce Coaching on Friday morning

Last night the men were described as ‘very experienced offshore yachtsmen’ and friends and family were understood to be ‘devastated’ the search for them had been called off so soon.

The yacht ran into difficulties some 620 miles east of Cape Cod in Massachusetts last Thursday. Contact was lost in the early hours of Friday morning after the crew radioed they they were taking on water and were diverting to the Azores.

US and Canadian aircraft and merchant vessels searched throughout Friday and Saturday but the operation was called off yesterday.

On Saturday a container ship discovered an overturned hull that matched the description of the Cheeki Rafiki but there was no sign of the crew, so the vessel was not inspected.

The four men were sailing the Cheeki Rafiki back to the UK for Southampton-based yacht training and charter company Stormforce Coaching.

The US Coastguard were contacted by the yacht’s managers in Falmouth, Cornwall, on Friday. Two personal locator beacons registered to the yacht had been activated, but they have since stopped transmitting signals.

A coastguard spokesman said: ‘We searched with multiple assets over 4,000 square miles for pings from the vessel’s personal locator beacons. After receiving no more transmissions we believe that we would have found them by now if we were going to find them.

‘These beacons are small devices and the ones being used have a very short battery life.’

US and Canadian aircraft and merchant vessels looked for the crew throughout Friday and Saturday but later called off the search. Stormforce director Doug Innes said he was 'devastated' the search had been stopped

Weather conditions in the area were described as treacherous, with winds in excess of 50 knots, waves of 15 to 20ft and visibility reduced to under a mile.

Mr Bridge, who is from Farnham in Surrey, was being paid by Stormforce to captain the yacht.

His aunt Georgina told Sky News: ‘Obviously the family are really concerned that the search has been suspended and we are really hoping that it will be resumed.

‘We are holding out great hope that Andrew and the guys on board Cheeki Rafiki will be found. We are hopeful they were able to launch a liferaft, so we would really like the search to be resumed.’

Miss Bridge explained that all four men were ‘very experienced sailors’, adding: ‘Andrew has been sailing since he was a small child.

‘He is a very experienced captain and has sailed Cheeki Rafiki a great deal. Sailing is his passion and we just want him home.’

'Mr Goslin, from West Camel, Mr Warren, from Bridgwater, both in Somerset, and Mr Male, of Southampton, were described as ‘very experienced offshore yachtsmen’.

Stormforce director Doug Innes said: ‘We are devastated the search has now been called off so soon.

‘Our thoughts are with the four yachtsmen and their families and we hope and pray for them all.’

US coastguard Robert Simpson said the search had been hampered by storms in the Atlantic.

Too late: A spokesman for the US coastguard said he believes the search teams would have found the sailors by now if they were going to find them at all

‘The conditions are very bad and getting
 worse,’ he said. ‘The search area is too vast to continue. The case is 
not yet closed, but there are no plans to resume the search. We had 
hoped we would find them. Sadly, that has not happened.’

Craig Burton, from the Royal Yachting Association, said the crew was ‘very, very experienced’.

He said: ‘The skipper, Andy, has done numerous ocean crossings, he’s a very experienced guy.’

Yachting experts expressed concern that the hull of the yacht had been found but not inspected.

Andrew
 Pindar, of the GAC Pindar racing team, said: ‘The fear with yachts 
upside down is that people could be trapped inside them.’
