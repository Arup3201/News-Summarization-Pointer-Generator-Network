Football clubs commemorated the centenary year of the First World War with a number of tributes across the country on Saturday.

All 20 Premier League clubs are wearing specially designed poppies on their shirts, emblazoned with '1914-2014 Football Remembers' 

They will be seen on team's jerseys either this weekend or next, in the latest line of support from English football's top flight sides.

Every year Premier League outfits support the Royal British Legion’s Poppy Appeal by wearing shirts with the official poppy on them. 

However; for this year's Remembrance Day, on November 9, the Royal British Legion has approved the one-off poppy.

In Saturday's early kick-off Newcastle observed a one-minute's silence with Liverpool at St. James' Park.

The fixture was the Magpies' final game at home before Remembrance Day and so marked the occasion in this respectful manner.

Chelsea, Everton, Hull and Leicester all observed a minutes silence too at their home games in memory of those who had fallen.

In north London, Arsenal installed two giant poppies above Armoury Square overlooking Hornsey Road at their Emirates Stadium. The tribute will remain in place until Armistice Day on November 11.

Several clubs are expected to auction off their Poppy shirts from Remembrance Week for the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal.
