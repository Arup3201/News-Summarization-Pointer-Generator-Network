Senior Tory MPs mocked a former minister’s striking leopard-print outfit behind her back at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday.

Cheryl Gillan, the former  Welsh Secretary, was called to ask David Cameron about plans for the controversial HS2 high-speed rail line, which she bitterly opposes.

As she spoke, Keith Simpson, parliamentary aide to Foreign Secretary William Hague, was heard to make roaring noises while clawing the air like a big cat.

Former education minister Tim Loughton appeared to join in, prompting colleagues seated on adjacent benches to collapse in laughter.

Health Minister Anna Soubry was also seen scratching at the air, and Government whip Anne Milton joined in the merriment but then leant across to pat Mr Simpson on the arm and advise him to stop.

The joke appeared to be directed at Mrs Gillan’s choice of clothes, but also reflected colleagues’ boredom with her focus on the Government’s HS2 project.

Since leaving the Cabinet in David Cameron’s last reshuffle, she has asked about little else.

The mockery risks exacerbating claims that senior Tories are too prone to behaviour and remarks that could be seen as sexist.

However Mrs Gillan’s office said she had been aware of what was going on behind her but was ‘not particularly bothered’.

Mr Simpson’s boss, Mr Hague, had to apologise last week after being seen to mutter ‘stupid woman’ at a Labour MP who raised questions about donations to his office.

And David Cameron once told Labour front bencher Angela Eagle to ‘calm down, dear’ during a rowdy session of Prime Minister’s Questions.
