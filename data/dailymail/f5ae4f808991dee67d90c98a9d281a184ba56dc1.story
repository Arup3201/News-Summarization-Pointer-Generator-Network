Coalition tensions over immigration deepened today, with David Cameron accusing Nick Clegg of opposing himself.

A plan for a £3,000 bond to deter illegal immigrants has been dropped, after it was vetoed by Mr Clegg.

But Mr Cameron said he was surprised by the Lib Dem opposition because 'this was an idea that the Deputy Prime Minister first proposed'.

Under the proposals, temporary migrants from high-risk countries – such as Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Ghana – would have paid a surety before coming to Britain, and have it seized if they failed to leave when their visa expired.

The proposal, a Tory manifesto commitment, was to be tested later this month. In a speech in March Mr Clegg tried to take credit for the idea but now wants to disown it.

Lib Dem sources said Home Secretary Theresa May's version of the policy was 'not acceptable' to the party and not supported by other departments.

'They have seen the writing on the wall and binned it off. We have been clear from the start that the version was just not acceptable to us,' they said.

But Mr Cameron today tried to pin blame for the confusion on his Lib Dem deputy.

He told the CBI annual conference in central London: 'This was an idea that the Deputy Prime Minister first proposed but we are not proposing to go ahead with it.'

To laughs, he added: 'He has lots of good ideas but this one is not one we are going ahead with.'

The scheme was expected to apply to visitors from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Ghana and Nigeria who would have paid up for a six-month visa.

Home Secretary Theresa May ridiculed the Liberal Democrats' stance on immigration bonds at the Conservative party conference

In March Mr Clegg appeared to back 
the policy in a speech in which he said there should be ‘zero tolerance’
of those who abuse the immigration system.

But later this year he threatened to block the scheme if bonds were applied in an ‘indiscriminate way’.

‘I
am absolutely not interested in a bond which becomes an indiscriminate 
way of clobbering people who want to come to this country, and in many 
respects bring great prosperity and benefits to this country, of course 
not.’

Business Secretary Vince Cable had 
suggested the policy could be used as a way of allowing in visitors who 
had been refused a visa.

This stance was ridiculed by Home Secretary Theresa May in her Tory party conference speech.

She said Mr Cable’s idea amounted to paying for ‘more immigrants to come here’.

She said: ‘Our drive to cut immigration has been so successful, even the Liberal Democrats are boasting about it in their campaign handbook.

Labour MP Keith Vaz described the plans as 'unfair and discriminatory'

'I don’t remember their enthusiasm 
for cutting immigration when we worked on the policies - so I’m going to
take this with me next time they try to block our reforms.

‘Bonds
were in our manifesto at the last election. But the Lib Dems suddenly 
announced that it was their idea. Then they said they were against them.

‘Then
they said they were for them - but only to help more immigrants to come
here. Now they say they’re against them after all.

'They were for them, then they were against them... then they were for them, and now they’re against them.’

‘Confused? Don’t be - the simple conclusion is you can only trust the Conservatives on immigration.

Lib Dem sources said the policy was ‘not acceptable to the Liberal Democrats and was not supported by other government departments.’

One said: ‘We have been clear from the start that the version was just not acceptable to us.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Government has been considering whether we pilot a bond scheme that would deter people from overstaying the visa. We have decided not to proceed.’

Tory ministers are trying to cut net migration - the difference between the numbers arriving and those leaving - to below 100,000 by the time of the next general election.

Labour MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, described the scheme as ‘unfair and discriminatory’.
