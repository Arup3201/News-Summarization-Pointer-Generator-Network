Fired: Deborah O'Conner was fired from Florida State University after going on a racist, homophic, anti-muslim tirade in public Facebook posts

A Florida university is down one outspoken racist this week after business communications lecturer Deborah O'Conner resigned following a Facebook tirade that name-checked blacks, gays and 'filthy rodent Muslims.'

O'Conner, who holds a Ph.D. from Florida State University and has taught there for 18 years, made the career ending series of remarks on a stranger's Facebook page.

That stranger, New York-based stylist Colin Lively, became the subject of the teacher's ire when he--a friend of a friend of O'Conner's--wrote a post about Eric Holder's finding that Celevand police engage in excessive force.

'YOU elected POTUS, Holder et al. And they are supposed to represent all Americans, not just blacks,' O'Conner wrote in a tirade first reported  by Folioweekly.com. 'Why don't these ass clowns insert themselves into their stories?'

Things escalated from there.

'Take your Northern fagoot [sic] elitism and shove it up your a**,' she wrote. 'I teach at a University, you asshole. What do you do?

'You are an intellectual fraud, just like your Messiah. Obama has single-handedly turned our once great society into a Ghetto Culture, rivaling that of Europe. 

'France is almost at war because of his filthy rodent Muslims who are attacking Native Frenchmen and women,' O'Conner wrote.

Lively told the Tallahassee Democrat that he found the stranger's comments on his Facebook post amusing at first but was eventually taken aback by how far she went with her hate speech.

'I'm surprised her employers weren't aware of her and hadn't done something about it,' he said. 'I feel very bad for any woman who carries that kind of rage inside her heart.'

O'Conner closed her rant with a personal jab at Lively, one that appeared to reference his job and sexual preference.

'I just looked at your picture and what you do for a living,' she wrote. 'I'm signing off now. I don't talk to you people.' 

A friend of Lively's saw the rant and screen-capped it before O'Conner soon deleted her account. Then the comments were passed to the local chapter of the National Justice Network.

The group reached out to alert FSU with a strongly worded letter of condemnation. O'Conner soon offered her resignation.

She did not, however, offer any apologies. 

'I must emphasize that I do NOT believe the punishment fits the "crime,"' she wrote. 'As a supporter of FSU since 1975, I feel cheated and betrayed.'

O'Conner even asked business school dean Caryn Beck-Dudley for a favor: 'Is there any chance the story can be suppressed to minimize further injury to my reputation?'

Beck-Dudley's response does not acknowledge the request and as she accepts the resignation the dean is careful not to condone the way it was given.

'I am not agreeing with or admitting to any statements that you have made in your emails which contain several untrue statements and misrepresentations,' the dean wrote.

Asked a favor: O'Conner submitted her resignation from Florida State University, where she'd taught for 18 years, on Saturday. She also asked for help keeping her reputation clean, a request her dean did not address
