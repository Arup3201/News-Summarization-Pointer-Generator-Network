An Italian teenager has died after falling 60 feet on to jagged rocks as she tried to take a ‘selfie’.

Sixteen-year-old Isabella Fracchiolla was trying to take a photograph of herself on the seafront during a school trip to the seaside town of Taranto, in south-eastern Italy.

The schoolgirl who suffered injuries to her femur, pelvis and head was rushed to hospital where she underwent a major operation.

But doctors were unable to save her life, Italian newspaper Corriere del Mezzogiorno said.

The craze for ‘selfies’ has gained global popularity and has fans as wide ranging as Pope Francis and Ellen de Generes.

But experts have warned people are increasingly putting themselves at risk as they try to take more spectacular and risky self portraits to outdo their friends.

The drive to put more and more outlandish pictures on social media sites has already had tragic consequences.

In April a 17-year-old Russian girl plunged 30 feet to her death after climbing onto a railway bridge and getting electrocuted by live wires.

The same month a 32-year-old woman in South Carolina, who was posting selfies online as she drove, died when she crashed her car head-on into a truck.

Earlier this year a 21-year-old man in Spain was killed by a 3,500 volt electric shock after climbing on top of a train.
