A Facebook rant allegedly posted online by a South Australian doctor charged with murdering his wife while on holiday in Tasmania has revealed his anguish over her affair.

Robin Michael, 63, is believed to have posted the lengthy accusation early on Thursday morning, an action which prompted his wife's family to contact police out of concern for her safety. In the post he hints that his wife may have been having an affair with one of his close friends. 

'I have taught (his friend) everything I could, I have encouraged him, promoted him to others and protected him when required,' he allegedly wrote.

'So why would he think he has the right to engage in an affair with someone that he knows is the centre of my life.'

The post continued, with Mr Michael spilling out his heart for all his Facebook friends and family to see.  

'I hold her at night and there is no drug that would deliver that same sensation to me ... I thought she was my life partner and would never do me wrong. She is my heartbeat,' he wrote.  

However, speaking to Adelaide Now, Mrs Michael's son, Nathan Heanes-Cahill, said he refused to believe Michael's claims that his mother had an affair and said his mother and Mr Michael appeared to have the perfect relationship.

'I am as close as anyone to Mum and that was news to me,' he said. 

Mrs Michael's body was found on Mount Roland in Tasmania 

'That Facebook post was the first thing that brought it to me, from what I believe and what their relationship was like, I don't believe it,' he said.

'They did a lot of things together and I guess Mum is lucky because a lot of the things she got to do she wouldn't have done without Robin. They travelled a lot together,' he said. 

Kerry Michael's sister Tracey Heanes said that the family knew 'that it wasn't in character and then they rang the police straight away and that's why it was immediately dealt with'.

'As soon as that post went on Facebook we were on our way over because we knew that something obviously was wrong,' she told the newspaper. 

Ms Michael's family said that the 44-year-old was a very loyal and funny person, and was well-like by so many friends.

She was 'just the life of the party and always there for her family and friends and completely devoted to her son,' said Ms Heanes.

Ms Michael's family is understood to be struggling with the news of her death after her body was discovered on a 1,200 metre mountain in Tasmania on Thursday.

The couple had been on holidays in Tasmania where they had been travelling for several weeks, when her body was discovered near the summit of Mount Roland, in the state's northwest.

The pair are believed to have gone for a walk on the mountain, near the town of Sheffield, before her body was discovered 200 metres from the top of the mountain at approximately 2pm.

An air search was launched by authorities, who said Ms Michael had suffered trauma injuries. 

'There's some contact between family members that created concern for her welfare that led us to this area,' said Inspector Kim Steven.

'I believe there were some social media interaction that raised those concerns,' he told The ABC. 

Tasmanian police confirmed on Friday that Mr Michael, a health administrator with nearly 30 years experience, had been charged with the death of his wife.

Mr Michael was apprehended at the caravan park they had been staying at with believed self-inflicted wounds

He was arrested at the East Devonport caravan park and was taken into custody after being treated in hospital.

'We know they went for a day walk on Wednesday morning and that the woman was killed that day,' Inspector Stevens told Adelaide Now.

'While a man is in custody, we still need to build an exact picture of what took place and are appealing for anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area to come forward.' 

He was silent at a hearing in Davenport on Friday, appearing before a magistrate in blue overalls with no shoes on his feet and a cut on his face, which is believed to be self-inflicted.

Mr Michaels did not enter a plea, and will reappear on Tuesday.

He has been refused bail.

The 63-year-old had returned to Adelaide in 2007 as the chief executive at Radiology Resources Pty Ltd after serving as the general manager Royal Darwin Hospital.

He has also worked with the South Australian Department of Human Services, where he acted as the executive director. 

Forensic evidence has been gathered by police who were transported to the mountain by helicopter.

The couple's camper van, which they had been travelling in for several weeks, was examined by authorities.
