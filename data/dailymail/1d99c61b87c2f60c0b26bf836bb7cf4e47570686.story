David de Gea may have been winning many admirers this season, but the Manchester United keeper only has eyes for one... and he isn't afraid to show it with a very public display of affection.

The Spain international has arguably been the best keeper in the Premier League with a succession of man-of-the-match performances against the likes of Stoke and Liverpool contributing to United's seven-game unbeaten run.

The 23-year-old celebrated his girlfriend Edurne Garcia Almagro's birthday by posting an Instagram picture of the pair pulling faces, accompanied by the lovestruck caption: 'Lots of things get better year after year. You are one of those!! Happy birthday princess!! I love you lots!'.

Despite a difficult start to the season, Manchester United have moved up to third place in the table following their 1-1 draw with 10-man Aston Villa on Saturday.

Villa have launched an official appeal against the sending off of Gabby Agbonlahor following a 50-50 challenge with Ashley Young - with the United winger admitting he thought he had been at fault.

The former champions host Newcastle at Old Trafford on Boxing Day before ending the year's fixtures against Tottenham on December 28.
