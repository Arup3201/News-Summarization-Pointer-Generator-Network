The best man of a triple amputee soldier was today jailed after he stole thousands of pounds from the Afghanistan veteran just before his wedding day.

Conor Aldous, 22, stole £2,500 from Private Alex Stringer just weeks before he married his childhood sweetheart Danielle.

Private Stringer, 23, from Canvey Island, Essex, lost both his legs and his left arm after stepping on a Taliban improvised explosive device (IED) whilst serving in Afghanistan in January 2011.

When the soldier returned home after his traumatic ordeal, Aldous offered to act as his carer - moving in to his home and sleeping in the living room.

He was trusted with access to bank 
accounts and PIN codes to help his school friend during his 
recovery.

Aldous abused this trust - stealing the money from his friend's account.

Today Aldous, 
from Grays, Essex, was jailed for 10 months at Badilson Crown Court after admitting one count of
 theft at an earlier hearing at Southend Magistrates’ court. A confiscation order for £2,500 was also made.

Judge David Owen-Jones, sentencing, said: 'It was a mean offence. He was extremely vulnerable and you abused that trust.

'It is a very serious offence and only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.'

Aldous,
 who was accompanied to court by his pregnant girlfriend, showed no 
reaction as the sentence was passed. His partner broke down in tears as 
Aldous was led to the cells by a security guard.

The
 court heard today how Aldous was staying at the soldier's home in 
Canvey Island, Essex, but was secretly stealing their money.

The
 thefts were only discovered when a routine call from the bank revealed a
 £40 transaction had in fact been £100, raising suspicions.

The couple, who have three young children, then reviewed their bank statements in horror only to find a number of unauthorised transactions by Aldous.

Charlotte Davison, prosecuting, said the couple initially believed Aldous’ excuses.

But in July 2012 a credit card statement showed more money had been withdrawn in the form of cash from the accounts.

She said: 'They confronted him and he admitted he had been skimming additional funds from their credit card account.'

The generous couple agreed to a contract which would see Aldous pay the stolen money back but not a penny was returned and they eventually called the police in to investigate.

Aldous made full admissions to the theft when he was interviewed. He was given a more lenient sentence because of his confession.

Matthew Bone, mitigating, said: 'This was very unpleasant abuse.

'The victim in this case was disabled serving his country. This man was his friend, this man breached the trust of his friend and he has to live with what he has done in this case.

'It is very difficult to understand why it is that this offence was committed, especially within the context of the generosity that Mr and Mrs Stringer showed this defendant.

'Whatever the sentence, Mr Aldous will have to live with the fact that he is a man who committed this very mean offence and he has to live with the consequences of his actions.'

The court heard Aldous had committed previous, similar, offences of theft and fraud against both friends and former employers.

Speaking outside court today, the soldier (pictured at home) said: 'It's absolutely disgusting as this money was supposed to be our children's futures'

Mr Bone said Aldous was an 'immature' and 'young' 22-year-old.

After the sentencing Mr Stringer and his wife, 22, said they were pleased to see Aldous jailed for his actions.

Mr Stringer said: 'What is done is done - I don’t really have anything to say about the sentence.'

But the couple, who were at court, spoke of the devastating effect the theft has had on Alex, 23, and their young family Millie, five, Harlie, three, and one-year-old Jessica.

Private Alex Stringer stepped on a Taliban Improvised Explosive Device in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in January 2011.Pte Stringer, of the 23 ­Pioneer Regiment Royal Logistics Corps, needed more than 30 ­operations after losing both legs, shattering his ­pelvis and ­suffering such ­severe injuries to his left arm that it had to be amputated at the elbow.

For many months after the blast, he spent three weeks every two months at the Army’s rehabilitation ­centre in Headley Court, Surrey.

The soldier previously gained media attention when he and his then fiancee Danielle were moved to a flat on the sixth floor of a block in Chadwell St Mary, Essex.

He married Danielle in July 2012.

Mr Stringer said: 'We gave him [Conor] absolutely everything he needed. I’ve known him since school - for about eight years. He even helped me walk down the aisle on my stumps on my wedding day.

But he twisted that friendship to play me and Danielle off against each other. He convinced me we were overspending on our wedding to cover up the thefts.

'When we found out I gave him the chance to admit it to my face but instead he chose to confess through a message on Facebook. The guy is a coward.

'The worst thing is having to explain to a four-year-old that the person she looked up to won’t be coming back. It is our children’s money and future that he has stolen.'

Mrs Stringer added: 'It seems silly to say it now but we just trusted him. We were so busy with moving into a new house and the wedding we gave him control over everything.

'He was always offering to help and we were just pleased to have another set of hands around the house. We invited him into our home and gave him a roof over his head and this is how he has repaid us.

'It’s absolutely disgusting as this money was supposed to be our children’s futures. When I told Millie that was never coming back she broke down crying and I had to with her to stop her sobbing - it was heart-breaking.'
