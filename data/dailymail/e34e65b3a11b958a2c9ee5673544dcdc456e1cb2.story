If the panicked run-up to Christmas and miserable weather have you dreaming of escaping to sunny climes then it's probably best to look away now.

Renowned beach and swimwear company Heidi Klein has unveiled its new campaign, with American model Le Call looking spectacular as she frolics on stunning, sun-drenched beaches in Jumby Bay, Antigua.

The 31-year-old model showcases the elegant new Resort-Summer 2014 collection which is modern and sophisticated, with sharp contrasts and bold colour harmonies running across the pieces.

The Abaco beach eyelet curved hem dress, £220, is the perfect thing to slip on over a bikini

Floaty white linen shirts and as well as white and earth tone-patterned beach dresses feature alongside the bikinis in the collection.

Geometric patterns aim to flatter the form and the earth tones are timelessly elegant while the mix and match swimwear in playful candy colours lifts the collection.

As well as the campaign photos, Heidi Klein has released a video of the photo shoot which is a world away from the dreary winter weather most of us are experiencing.

The video sees Le Call diving into crystal clear waters before standing on a deserted beach silhouetted against the setting sun.

Heidi Klein has become the go-to place for the well to do and fashionable seeking out barefoot chic or super yacht glamour (pictured: Sete ring rope triangle padded bikini, £190)

The model is no stranger to posing half-naked, having previously fronted a campaign for lingerie brand Myla.

Last summer Heidi Klein’s collection was modelled by Victoria’s Secret angel Jessica Van Der Steen and featured bold colours and bright neons in contrast to this year’s more muted, refined look.
