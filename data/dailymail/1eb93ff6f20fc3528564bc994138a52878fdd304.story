Almost £6,000 worth of Viagra and other medical supplies were among items worth more than £7million to be stolen from the Ministry of Defence since 2007.

The anti-impotence pills were among medical stocks swiped from RAF Marham in Norfolk, while across the country bayonets, ammunition and even equipment from nuclear submarines have been taken.

A replica AK-47 assault rifle also vanished from a military base, before it was later returned, and thieves also managed to smuggle large items including an aircraft fuselage, a Bedford Truck and a washing machine out of MoD sites.

Site: The Viagra was taken from RAF Marham in Norfolk. The MoD said that the anti-impotency drug could also be used to treat low blood pressure and altitude sickness

Thousands of rounds of live and blank ammunition and 100 bayonets were also taken, along with magazines and gun parts, according to The Times.

Despite being more commonly associated with sexual impotence, Viagra has other medical uses, as an MoD spokesman pointed out.

'For example it is often used to treat low blood pressure and altitude sickness,' the spokesman told The Times.

Nearly £7million worth of equipment 
has been stolen from the MoD since 2007 - figures revealed in response 
to a parliamentary question posed by Tory MP Nick de Bois.

The
 MP for Enfield North asked what the value of equipment taken from the 
department was, and was told by Defence minister Andrew Murrison that 
£6,628,057 worth was suspected as having been stolen between April 2007 
and January 15 this year.

'These
 figures do not take into account the value of items subsequently 
recovered or that investigations may have established later that the 
temporary loss of an item was not the result of fraud or theft,' he 
added.

'We are vigorous in 
seeking to recover items suspected as stolen and have so far 
successfully recovered items to the value of around £600,000. We have 
also achieved improvements in detection and reporting in recent years.'

Dr Murrison also said that a new 
counter fraud and loss department was set up by the MoD last year in 
order to minimise the losses from the Defence budget through fraud, misappropriation and theft - freeing up more money to be spent on the Armed Forces.

Military
 budgets and troop numbers have been subject to cuts in order to plug a 
multi-billion pound blackhole in the defence budget.

The Army is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 over a number of years, with the 20,000 posts expected to be gone by 2020.

Navy numbers are expected to fall by 6,000, while the RAF will lose 5,000 staff.

The release of the the value of items stolen came after Sergeant Major Steven Barratt was jailed for 20 months after he tried to sell £115,000 worth of Army night vision equipment via eBay.

In October 2012 40 anti-tank mines were taken from a goods train carrying explosives as it came to a stop for a red light near Warrington.

Officials only noticed that the  mines were missing the following day when the train arrived in Didcot, Oxfordshire.

The five civilian thieves, described in court as 'opportunistic' were sentenced to a total of 30 years in prison.

In
 March last year a pulse oximeter, used to measure blood oxygen 
saturation, was taken from Nuclear Submarine HMS Ambush.

And last 
January it was revealed that the Royal Marines Commando Training Centre 
in Lympstone, Devon, had 'lost' more than 8,000 items since 2008.

A dozen hand grenades, 100 bayonets, 600 magazine assemblies for the SA80 assault rifle, 470 items of clothing and footwear and 781 towels all vanished - as did DVD players, televisions and stereos.

In 2010 a silver statue worth £25,000 was
 taken from the Household Cavalry barracks in Knightsbridge, and more 
than £7,000 of silver cutlery was stolen from the Redford barracks in 
Edinburgh.

Cuts: Prime Minister David Cameron meets British soldiers in Afghanistan in 2012. Military budgets and troop numbers have been subject to cuts in order to plug a multi-billion pound blackhole in the defence budget

An MoD spokesman told MailOnline: 'The security of our personnel and assets remains of paramount importance and the MOD works hard to detect and deter theft.

'There are robust processes in place to raise awareness of the need for vigilance in all aspects of security, but just as theft occurs in wider society, the MOD is not immune and we actively encourage individuals to report any evidence of loss or suspicion or theft.

'Where theft does occur and a suspect is identified, prosecution or internal disciplinary action will follow as appropriate.'
