An uptick in births at Washington, DC-area hospitals is giving a clue as to how all the nonessential government workers spent their free time off from work during last year's government shutdown, while Congress was fighting over a new budget.

July 1 marked exactly nine months since the October 1-16 sequester, and with many of the furloughed employees in the Washington, DC-area, local hospitals are noticing a baby boom.

Officials at Sibley Memorial Hospital in northwestern DC told ABC News they are at 'near-capacity' with three more births each day than usual. Meanwhile, there have been 120 more births this year at Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis, Maryland and 100 more births in the past three months at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington compared to same period in 2013.

Furlough baby: Sarah and Ali Heidarpour gave birth to their daughter Lauren earlier this month. They say she was conceived while Ali was out of work during last year's government shutdown. Doctors in the DC-area are noticing a rise in births exactly nine months after the sequester

Free time: Non-essential government employees were sent home for two weeks last October while Congress fought over a new federal budget

Baby boom: Sibley Hospital in Washington, DC is experiencing three more births than usual this month

'We keep getting asked,"What’s going on?"' Sibley nurse Yulette Newman told the Washington Post. 'And we sit back and say, "Well, you’re 
in D.C. What was happening nine months ago?"'

Couple Ali and Sarah Heidarpour didn't realize they conceived their daughter Lauren during the shutdown until they received a call 45 minutes before Sarah was scheduled to give birth, with news that the maternity ward was full.

Sarah says she and Ali 'definitely' conceived their daughter Lauren in October, when her husband was off work with the Labor Department.

'When I first saw how busy it was I said, "Well, all the husbands and 
dads were busy at the same time,"' Ali Heidarpour told WJLA.

And Sibley obstetrician Dr Maro Sarafian notes that there is an unusual amount of federal workers giving birth.

'When I first saw how busy it was I said, "Well, all the husbands and dads were busy at the same time,"' Ali Heidarpour (pictured) said.

Jessica Hernandez, a program analyst for the Food and Drug Administration, gave birth to her daughter Gabrielle Nadine on June 3. She says she was one of three women in her 150-person office who announced pregnancies after the sequester.

But health care workers are pointing out that the rise in birth rates is just anecdotal, and officials at other area hospitals such as Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital and Inova Fairfaz Hospital have not reported a rise in births.

'It’s just so appealing to think, "Oh, it’s a full moon," or "it’s nine 
months after a blackout or Hurricane Sandy,"' Dr Marjorie 
Greenfield, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at University Hospitals 
Case Medical Center in Cleveland, told ABC News. 'But there’s a lot of natural 
fluctuation.'
