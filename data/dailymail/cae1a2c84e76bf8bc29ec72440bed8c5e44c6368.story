It was unveiled as Labour’s latest vehicle for attracting women’s votes at the election.

But Harriet Harman’s pink minibus immediately came under fire for being ‘patronising’ and ‘sexist’.

The 16-seat van will tour Britain ahead of the election in what the party is calling its ‘Woman to Woman’ campaign.

Pink: Female Labour MPs will travel the country in a women's-only battle bus painted pink, it was revealed

Miss Harman claimed the bus was ‘something new and something different’, which would encourage women who were ‘disillusioned’ by politics and create a ‘Domesday Book’ of women’s demands for politicians.

But it was immediately condemned as a ‘gimmick’. 

Labour sources said Miss Harman was warned by allies the bus was incredibly patronising towards women but she was ‘utterly defiant’ and insisted it go ahead.

Labour sources said Miss Harman was warned by allies the bus was incredibly patronising towards women but she was ‘utterly defiant’ and insisted it go ahead.

Meanwhile, Lucy Powell, a senior figure in the party’s election campaign, also risked accusations of sexism when she said Labour wanted to have a conversation with women ‘around the kitchen table’.

Atul Hatwal, editor of the grassroots website Labour Uncut, said: ‘A pink bus for women? What next? A convoy of Labour rickshaws wheeling round Bradford?’ 

Defensive: Labour's Deputy leader Harriet Harman said Labour 'did not any lectures on patronising women'

Angry: Miss Harman reacted furiously to criticism of the women-to-women bus. She tweeted: 'Our bus equals listening to women, ending pay inequality, 25 hours childcare, tackling violence against women'

Critics took to social media and dubbed the vehicle ‘Barbie bus’ because of its similarity to the pink plastic toy brand.

The vehicle was branded ‘laughable’ and ‘ridiculous’, while users posted pictures of toy Barbie buses to mock the campaign.

Tom Wilson wrote: ‘One looks at #Labour’s “Barbie bus” and you just wonder, exactly how stupid do these people think women are?’

Niamh Kingsley tweeted: ‘I mean this really is laughable, come on. Labour launching a pink bus, yes pink bus, to target women.’

New: Harriet Harman claimed the bus was ‘something new and something different’, which would encourage women who were ‘disillusioned’ by politics

Jennie Kreser wrote: ‘Dear Harriet Harman … that pink bus is patronising and insulting and you got it VERY WRONG. Yours sincerely, A Woman.’

The bus was widely dismissed as ‘patronising’, while the hashtag #everydaysexism was used.

Mrs Powell risked running into a similar storm as she attempted to contrast Labour’s ‘kitchen table’ campaign with the economy under the Tories which ‘just reaches the boardroom table’. 

She said: ‘That’s why we’re taking our message out around the country to have that conversation about the kitchen table … around the kitchen table’.

Miss Harman presented a picture of the bus at a campaign launch in London yesterday, but the bus itself was not revealed. 

She said the ‘collective’ that selected the colour ruled out red because it would be like all other Labour buses and they wanted ‘something different’.

The senior Labour women in attendance were unable even to agree on what colour the bus was – but refused to accept it was pink.

Miss Harman claimed it was ‘magenta’ in colour, then insisted it was the ‘correct colour’ before settling on calling it ‘One Nation Labour’ colour.

Gloria de Piero, Labour’s spokesman on women and equalities, said the bus was ‘cerise’.

It will tour more than 70 constituencies during the election campaign, carrying women from the shadow cabinet, MPs and councillors as well as trade union officials.

Tory MP Caroline Dinenage said: ‘This is clearly just another divisive gimmick that the electorate will see through.’

Miss Harman said: ‘I don’t think it’s at all patronising to recognise that women have got different patterns of their working life.’

In recent years, manufacturers and clothing firms have come under fire for gender-stereotyping by using pink for girls and blue for boys.

Campaigners say the ‘pinkification’ of girls is forcing them into a dangerously narrow mindset and teaching them that they should be passive and pretty, valuing beauty over brains. 

Liberal Democrat MP Jenny Willott said last year in Parliament that the message ‘pink is for girls, blue is for boys’ creates a gender divide that hampers girls’ progress at school.
