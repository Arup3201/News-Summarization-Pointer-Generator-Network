A young vicar nicknamed 'The Bush' on account of his afro hairdo was singled out by Manchester United fans at Old Trafford chanting 'there's only one Marouane Fellaini'.

The crowds spotted the likeness Reverend Simon Rose bears to the United midfielder, singing 'Fellaini give us a wave'.

The 26-year-old, who became the youngest religious minister in Nottingham when he joined the church in November, said he cannot go anywhere without people mistaking him for the footballer.

The Nottingham Forrest fan recently 
visited Old Trafford with a friend, when the crowds turned on him, 
joking that Fellaini, who also plays for the Belgian national side, was 
sitting in the stands.

But the good-humoured minister said he takes it all in his stride and doesn't mind the comparison with the football star.

Rev Rose, from Ruddington, said: 'I can’t go anywhere now without two or three people shouting "Fellaini" at me.

'Although
I’m a Nottingham Forest fan I went to watch Manchester United against West Ham
last month - half the crowd were singing 'Fellaini, give us a wave', 
and "there’s only one Marouane Fellaini".

'I’ve been called The Bush since school because my hair has always been like this - but now it’s just constant Fellaini comparisons.

'Some people have really had to double-take because they think I’m actually him. But I’m far from being a red-devil, that’s for sure.

'It’s a bit embarrassing but I take it in good humour all the time - you have to really.

'I do enjoy playing football but I’m not very good. I wouldn’t mind having his talents but for now I’m quite happy in my job as a minister.'

Rev Rose is one of only 18 Methodist ministers under the age of 30 in the UK - there are 2,185 in total.

The married vicar, whose Twitter name is @Simonrosebush, said he found his calling from God while studying business management at the University of Nottingham.

Rev Rose said: 'I do enjoy playing football but I'm not very good. I wouldn't mind having his talents but for now I'm quite happy with my job as a minister'

After graduating in 2008, he decided to become a local preacher before training to become a fully-qualified Methodist minister.

Rev Rose added: 'Some people are surprised by my age but I think people are getting used to it now.

'When I was carol singing in Bradmore in December, someone asked me whose son I was and I said 'I am actually the new minister'.

'They apologised quite quickly and we had a bit of a laugh.'
