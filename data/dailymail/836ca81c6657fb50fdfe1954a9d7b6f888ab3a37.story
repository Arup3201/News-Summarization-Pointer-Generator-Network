Lewis Hamilton plans to toast his Australian Grand Prix triumph with Hollywood A-Lister Arnold Schwarzenegger in Melbourne.

Hamilton issued an emphatic defence of his Formula One world championship with a flawless drive at the Albert Park Circuit in Sunday’s season opener.

The 30-year-old Briton left Nico Rosberg chomping on his Mercedes exhaust fumes on the run down to Turn 1 and from then on in the result never appeared in doubt.

Lewis Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger share a joke on the podium at the Australian Grand Prix

They ended the interview by saying: 'I'll be back'; Schwarzenegger's catchphrase from the Terminator films

It was the perfect start to Hamilton’s hopes of becoming the first British driver to win back-to-back titles, and join the likes of Ayrton Senna, Niki Lauda and Sir Jackie Stewart with a hat-trick of F1 championships. 

And a jubilant Hamilton hopes to celebrate his latest victory, the 34th of his grand prix career, with Schwarzenegger who conducted the podium interviews after the race.

'If he is around I will go out for a drink with him,’ said Hamilton. ‘I am not starstruck by many people but I was with him. I am a big fan.'

Hamilton provoked much hilarity on the podium when he appeared to be taken by surprise by the appearance of the Terminator star.

Hamilton is hopeful of hooking up with Schwarzenegger for a drink to toast his victory later on Sunday 

‘Hey, man! Wow,’ Hamilton said when Schwarzenegger walked on to the podium. ‘It’s an incredible feeling to continue winning, but also great to be up here with you… I thought you were taller!’ Schwarzenegger replied: 'I'm not wearing my high heels.' 

Moving to clarify his comments about the Austrian's height, Hamilton later said: ‘I don’t know what I said. I hope I didn't offend anyone. ‘It’s not like I said he was short, but I honestly thought he was taller.’

Hamilton and Schwarzenegger ended the interview by both saying 'I'll be back', the catchphrase made famous in the Terminator films.
