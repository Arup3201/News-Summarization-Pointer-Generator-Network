A new trend is seeing men wearing increasingly short shorts, with clothing companies following suit in order to meet demand.

While the Nineties and early Aughts may have been about keeping covered up in knee-skimming bottoms, these days it's becoming more and more fashionable for men to flaunt their thighs - as evidenced by street-stylers and celebrities including Pharrell and Penn Badgley.

The craze is especially relevant in an age where muscle-building work-outs like CrossFit and SoulCycle are all the rage - which Rainer Castillo says he had in mind when he co-founded men's clothing company Chubbies.

'We spend too much time in the gym to hide under frumpy shorts that say, "I don't care how I look,"' Mr Castillo told the Wall Street Journal.

Instead, his San Francisco-based company, which he started in 2011 with three other men in their twenties, specializes in shorts that are stylishly shorter.

Indeed, Chubbies exclusively sells shorts with a five-and-a-half-inch inseam, which falls just in the middle of the thigh.

Unlike the slouchy and disheveled cargo shorts of yesteryear, Chubbies' modern ones are 'comfortable, flexible, aerodynamic and most of all utterly radical,' reads the website.

'They are weekend BBQs in the sun. They are that perfect day on the beach.'

Bonobos is
 another mens retailer that has hopped on the short shorts bandwagon. At
 the e-commerce company's 'guideshops', they sell chino shorts in four 
different inseam lengths: 11, nine, seven and five inches.

The modern fit is more tailored and less tight than the short shorts of the Seventies and Eighties - like the bright gym shorts favored by Richard Simmons and Slater's denim cut-offs in Saved By The Bell.

'I just don't like the longer lengths - they cut off your body in a strange place'

Today, according to Dwight Fenton, the vice president of design at Bonobos, different types of men tend to gravitate towards different lengths.

Those who opt for five inches are 'the same young guys wearing the slim-cut suits,' who are often in their twenties, he said.

The 11-inch inseams, on the other hand, 
are preferred by teens who may be less comfortable revealing too much 
leg, as well as less interested in being on-trend.

J Crew also offers four lengths of shorts - five, seven, nine and ten-and-a-half inches.

At Ralph Lauren, too, men's shorts that fall above the knee are more the norm than the exception, with inseams ranging between a conservative nine-and-a-half inches to a more daring six.

Atlanta-based designer Sid Mashburn, who owns his own eponymous menswear label, says the logic behind short shorts for men is simple - they're more flattering.

'I just don't like the longer lengths,' he explained. 'They cut off your body in a strange place.'

As if! Long gone are the days where boys would 'just fall out of bed and put on some baggy pants,' in the words of Cher Horowitz from 1995 movie Clueless (pictured: a scene from the film)

Inseams are currently trendiest at between five-and-a-half and eight inches, instead of the 11 inches that have been popular for the past two decades
