Cesc Fabregas has said he asked to leave Barcelona to join Chelsea, despite the president of the Catalan giants attempting to stop the transfer.

Barcelona aimed a dig at Fabregas shortly after his £27million move was announced last week, saying he did not score enough goals during his three years with the club.

In a club statement they claimed there was a ‘downward trend in his stats ever season’ and that the Spain international ‘was never as good in the second half of a season as in the first.’

Despite it sounding like the Liga club
 were happy for him to leave, Fabregas has now said Barcelona president 
Josep Maria Bartomeu tried to block his move.

‘I
 asked Barcelona to find a way for me to leave the club,’ he told 
Spanish radio station Cadena COPE. ‘The president tried to stop the 
sale, but I already had my mind made up.

‘At
 the time, I spoke with Andoni Zubizarreta and the president (Josep 
Maria Bartomeu) and I told them I wanted to leave. Honestly, it all went
 really smoothly.

‘It’s not 
true that the club sent Messi. Leo didn’t ask me to stay. If you guys 
knew him, you’d know that he wouldn’t ask me for anything. Leo is 
phenomenal and told me to be happy wherever I go.’

The former Arsenal player scored 42 times in all competitions during his three seasons at Camp Nou.

In
 response to the criticism of his goalscoring rate in Spain, he said: 
‘The statistics aren’t bad, but I know that in big games, these goals 
and assists didn’t emerge.

‘I spent three spectacular years, with my friends, in Barcelona. It was a blast and we won six titles.’

The
 27-year-old, who is currently on international duty with Spain at the 
World Cup, said he cannot wait to return to London and work with 
Chelsea’s exciting young group of players.

‘If I didn’t think that I’d be happy at Chelsea, I would’ve never made this decision,’ said Fabregas.

‘Above
 all, I want to be happy both professionally and personally. On the 
professional side, there is a group of young players at Chelsea that I’m
 excited to work with. On the personal side, I have no doubt I’ll be 
happy, I lived in London for eight years, I have friends there, I have 
family there, and I’m an hour and a half away from Barcelona.’
