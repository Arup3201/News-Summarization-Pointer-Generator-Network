One of the longest serving inmates on death row, who snatched a ten-year-old girl as she rode her bike to school and then took her to an orange grove to beat her and cut her throat, was executed last night by lethal injection.

Larry Eugene Mann, 59, was pronounced dead at 7:19 pm on Wednesday night at Florida State Prison in Starke, outside of Tampa, after a judge overturned a last-minute, final appeal.

A group of Elisa's relatives sat in the front row wearing buttons with her photo on them.

The oil well driller was 27 when he abducted little Elisa Vera Nelson, who had been carrying a note in her pocket saying she would be late to school because of a dentist appointment.

The blood-covered note was later found by Mann's wife days after the murder.

Larry Eugene Mann, who killed 10-year-old Elisa Nelson in 1980 by slitting her throat, was executed Wednesday night at the Florida State Prison in Starke. He did not issue a final statement

Elisa Nelson, 10, had been riding her bicycle to school when she was abducted by Mann, taken to an orange grove, and killed

The convicted killer, when asked if he had any last words, told a prison officer: ‘Uh, no sir,’ according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Mann had his final meal at 10am, which included fried shrimp, fish and scallops, stuffed crabs, ice cream and a soda.

Elisa had been carrying a note with her from her mother saying she would be late to school because of a dentist appointment

On November 4, 1980, Mann, a resident of Dunedin, kidnapped her and took her to an orange grove, where he then slit her throat.

Days later, the body of Elisa was found lying under an avocado tree.

After slitting the girl's throat, Mann bashed her head in with a pole before going home and trying to commit suicide by slitting his wrists, telling the responding police officers he had 'done something stupid'.

An autopsy later showed that Elisa died from the blunt force trauma from the pole, which had a concrete block at one end.

Days later, Mann's wife found the bloodied note that Elisa's mother had written to explain why she was late for school.

Elisa’s cousin, Katy DeCarolis, who 
was at the execution, told the Tampa Bay Tribune: ‘Thank God it’s over,’
after Mann was declared dead tonight.

Mann had been appealing his death sentence since former Florida Gov Bob Graham signed it in 1986.

According
to the Tribune, Mann had several other instances of violent and sexual 
assault against girls. Court documents show that he raped a 
girl in Mississippi in 1973, and told that victim that if he didn’t ‘get
what he wanted’ from the girl, he would rape a toddler in the next 
room.

There are a total of 
406 inmates on Death Row in Florida, according to the state’s department
of corrections. Many of the condemned inmates’ offenses date back to 
the 1970s and 1980s.
