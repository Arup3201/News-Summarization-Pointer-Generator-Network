There is something about Anfield’s atmosphere on European nights that could prove really significant when the Champions League starts again this week. Liverpool are back for the first time since they were knocked out in the group stages in 2009.

 Many would say they are back where they belong because of the incredible history of those European Cup-winning sides of the Seventies and Eighties — and that truly extraordinary night in Istanbul in 2005.

It is a tournament that is in the DNA of the club and some European teams will leave Liverpool this season having had the shock of their lives, playing in front of that crowd in a Champions League night game.

On those evenings, there are few stadiums that can compare. And although Liverpool are back for the first time in five years, the other English clubs — Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal — cannot come close to Liverpool in terms of tradition in this tournament.

Of the current players, only Steven Gerrard has helped to create that history but sometimes that does not matter because many fans watching will have seen Liverpool in the Seventies and Eighties and would have been in Istanbul.

There is something about the energy that a crowd can give you that can make the difference on these occasions.

Saturday evening was a good example of the difference Europe makes — the atmosphere was flat in the 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa. I’m sure it will be different on Tuesday night. Liverpool have given their squad depth and can be scintillating in attack. 

They are also well disciplined and drilled tactically. Put all that together with an emotional Anfield crowd and many teams will come away wondering what has happened to them. Liverpool can get out of their group against Real Madrid, Basle, and Ludogorets. On their day, they could even give Real a shock and I have them down to make the quarter- or semi-finals.

In contrast, Manchester City have the squad size and the quality to win the Champions League, but at times they have played like novices in the tournament. It does not make any sense, because they have players who have now played in World Cup or Champions League finals and who have plenty of experience on the European stage.

But, somehow, that doesn’t translate on the pitch. Maybe as a club they need to build up some belief that will transmit itself to the players. It is almost as if those players, with all their experience, still have a psychological hurdle to overcome because the club are so new to the tournament.

That said, tactics have also played a part in City’s struggles, especially last year when Manuel Pellegrini played two strikers against the best teams. They ended up getting battered against Bayern Munich at home last season and it will be fascinating to see whether he does the same when they take on Bayern at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday.

Champions League games need a different plan from Premier League matches. Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson realised that. At the start of his career he was faithful to his 4-4-2 formation, but to win the Champions League he modified it to ensure he had an extra man in midfield.

With their spending, it is clear that City’s owners expect to win the Champions League — and soon — but I don’t believe this will be their year. Arsenal will have their moments and impress going forward. But I still feel they will be found out defensively. I was surprised they didn’t sign another holding midfielder or a centre-half.

Chelsea are probably the best- placed English team to win it. What I like about their squad is the balance. 

That back four doesn’t look like it’s going to let in goals, their midfield is considerably stronger than last season with Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic, and they have added Diego Costa up front. What I feel will cost them is a sustained challenge for the Premier League.

It is harder for English clubs to compete in Europe because there are more domestic games against strong rivals compared to Spain and Germany. And matches against lower-placed sides have more intensity, too. Chelsea have a superb core of 14 players, but they will struggle in Europe if they pick up injuries.

That’s why I think the most likely winner will come from Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Barcelona have added Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic, Jeremy Mathieu and Thomas Vermaelen but new coach Luis Enrique will be keen to ensure they are blooding youngsters from the academy. 

So much will depend on Lionel Messi. He didn’t look himself at the World Cup but if he can return to his best, then they can beat any team.

Holders Real Madrid have great options in attack, especially having signed James Rodridguez, but I wonder about the balance.

The fact that Sami Khedira is injured and they sold Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich reminds me of when president Florentino Perez sold Claude Makelele to Chelsea in 2003. Up to that point, Real were winning league titles and won the Champions League. After Makelele left they didn’t win the Champions League until this year and went four years before they won the league again. That is what happens when presidents sign players.

As for Bayern, signing Alonso might be really significant, especially as Javi Martinez and Thiago are injured. He brings balance to any team. They are full of World Cup winners in Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller and up front they have added Robert Lewandowski. Perhaps that makes Bayern marginal favourites.

It would be nice if it were an English team, but I just don’t see it.

Talk is cheap and if we really want English sides to do well in the Champions League we should ensure they receive the best help. 

Jose Mourinho has often brought up the fact that the Premier League scheduling does our teams no favours, whereas Spanish sides often play on a Friday night to allow more preparation time.

The Premier League should do the same, or at least start at 12.45pm on Saturdays. Our teams are playing in a more competitive league than their rivals and we need to make sure they are not at a disadvantage.
