Kenneth Cole has been accused of 'mocking war to sell fashion' after the designer posted a tweet making light of the U.S. government's decision to take military action in Syria.

'"Boots on the ground" or not, let's not forget about sandals, pumps and loafers. #Footwear,' the designer tweeted this afternoon.

The phrase 'boots on the ground' is used by President 
Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry in regards to the controversial deployment of American troops on Syrian soil.

Hundreds of Twitter users angered by the designer's statement are taking are no-holds-barred approach with their recriminations, labeling the tweet 'awful' and 'insensitive'.

TV personality Guy Adami, one of the 
original Fast Money Five on CNBC’s Fast Money, tweeted: '@KennethCole 
got to tell ya... that is in really poor taste. Too many brave women and
 men have sacrificed life and limb.'

Meanwhile, Heather Whaling, ‏founder of public relations firm Geben Communication, exclaimed: 'Mocking war to sell fashion? Really?' and fashion designer Bradely Scott added: 'Did you catch the tweet from Kenneth Cole? This is really 
disgusting.'

Maggie Fox, founder of Social Media Group, also voiced her opinion on the designer's tweet, writing: 
'Shameless. Maybe a visit to a refugee camp is in order? Cause war is 
*so funny*! cc @KennethCole'

This evening, the designer issued a statement to MailOnline defending his actions.

'For 30 years I have used my platform in provocative ways to encourage a healthy dialogue about important issues, including HIV/AIDS, war, and homelessness,' he wrote.

'I'm well aware of the risks that come with this approach, and if this encourages further awareness and discussion about critical issues then all-the-better.'

This is not the first time the designer, who will show his spring/summer 2014 collection at New York Fashion Week on Saturday, has caused controversy over a social media misfire.

Amid the 2011 political uprising in Egypt, Mr Cole sent a satirical tweet referencing the Arab Spring.

'Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now available online at http://bit.ly/KCairo … —KC,' the designer wrote.

The posting drew so much criticism on
 Twitter that an account devoted to parodies of the tweet was created. 
Mr Cole deleted his message and apologized on Facebook.
