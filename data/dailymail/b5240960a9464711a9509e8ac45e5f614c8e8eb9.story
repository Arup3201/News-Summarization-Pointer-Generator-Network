Italian dancer Flavia Cacace puts her world famous dance moves on display in a new campaign for Scottish jeweller Ortak.

The 33-year-old Strictly Come Dancing star shows off her toned physique in a series of figure-hugging black outfits in the shoot by photographer Gerardo Jaconelli.

She follows in the footsteps of actress Sarah Parish, TV presenter Carol Smillie and her daughter Christie, Myleene Klass, Amanda Lamb and Suzanne Shaw, who have all appeared in ad campaigns for Ortak.

Passion for jewellery: Flavia was shot by photographer Gerardo Jaconelli in a dance studio in Edinburgh

'Jewellery is a real 
passion of mine and I am very excited to be the new Face of Ortak,' says Flavia.

'It 
was fascinating to learn about the level of craftsmanship that goes into
each Ortak piece and it was great to get the first look at the new 
collection for Autumn.'

The brunette is currently preparing for the new series of the BBC dance show in October. She has previously been partnered with EastEnders star Matt Di Angelo (who she enjoyed a romance with), East Is East actor Jimi Mistry and astrologer Russell Grant.

'We were delighted when Flavia agreed to come on-board as the Face of Ortak for 2012/2013,' says Yvonne Carr, retail director of Ortak.

'We had a great time at the photo shoot in Edinburgh – Flavia is a natural in front of the camera and the results are stunning.

'We kept the concept very simple focusing on the energy and movement of dance – Flavia is a natural beauty and that really shines through in the pictures.'

Ortak, which has 15 stores across the UK, specialises in silver and gold jewellery, with its unique coloured enamel range among its best sellers.
