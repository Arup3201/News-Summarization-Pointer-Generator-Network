A legally blind resident of a Florida nudist colony is suing the resort association, claiming she is being harassed and intimidated because her guide dog weighs more than it should.

Sharon Fowler, 43, filed a civil rights lawsuit against Paradise Lakes Resort last year after the association allegedly told her to get rid of the dog or move out.

The mother, who suffers from a rare autoimmune disease that has taken her sight and soon her hearing, claims association members and residents repeatedly asked her to prove her disability, yelled at her in the street and said her service dog exceeded the community's weight limit.

'I felt demeaned, and I felt degraded,' Fowler told The Tampa Bay Times. 'I've never felt so degraded.'

Reliant: Sharon Fowler has relied on her guide dog since she was diagnosed with Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis several years ago

Fowler was diagnosed with Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels, about four years ago.

Her
 veins and capillaries began breaking down before her vision was affected. She's had 13 surgeries and takes 15 
medications a day.

Laura her four-year-old guide dog has been by her side for two-and-a-half years.

'She helps me to get around curbs and 
obstacles,' Fowler said. 'She's 100 percent necessary to me. She's my lifeline.'

Fowler said that when she moved with her family into the clothing optional-resort several years ago, her tenancy application specified that her guide dog weighed more than the association's 25-pound weight limit for pets.

The application was approved.

According to the website, Paradise Lakes Resort is 'a private, clothing optional hotel and resort' where 'you are welcome to be yourself in a tropical, fun filled setting.'

'If you are new to the world of clothing free or clothing optional way of life, you will find our policy of 'take off as much as you are comfortable with' to make the initial visits stress free,' the website adds.

Dismayed: Fowler said she had lived peacefully at the resort for several months before the tone changed in August 2012

Standing up for her rights: Sharon Fowler says she loves living at the nudist colony and doesn't want to move

Fowler said she lived peacefully at the resort for several months before the tone changed.

In August 2012,Â the association sent her landlord a letter saying they needed to address the issue of the dog 'immediately'.

They allegedly demanded that Fowler provide documentation proving her disability.

Fowler said Paradise Lakes Condominium Association president, Lisa Caruso, allegedly told her she could only walk the dog in specific 
areas and that it must move out of the way of pedestrians.

She also claimed people yelled at her, saying her dog was badly behaved and that she didn't clean up after Laura.

'My dog is a highly trained service animal,' Fowler said. 'She is not out of control.'

Caruso has consistently declined to comment to various media outlets, citing pending litigation.

However, for Fowler, moving out of Paradise Lakes Resort is not an option.

She loves the location and sometimes, when her children aren't around, she likes to walk around nude, The Tampa Bay Times reported.

Fowler and her attorney plan to re-file the lawsuit under the Federal Fair Housing Act, seeking an undisclosed amount of money for mental anguish, according to WTSP.com.

'I don't want anyone who has a service dog to ever be treated the way I've been treated. Someone has to stand up and say enough is enough,' Fowler said.
