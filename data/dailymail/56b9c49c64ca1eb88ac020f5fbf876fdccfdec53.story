A boy from Oklahoma didn't want any girls at his high school to feel left out on Valentine’s Day so he wrote cards for over 1,000 of them.

Dan Williams, a student at Edmond High School wrote anonymous valentines to 1076 girls at school because he wanted them to feel cared for whether they had a boyfriend or not.

The valentine that came with a lollipop read, 'remember there will always be people who care about you and I will always be one of them!'
