A hard-up father-of-three who moved his family into caravans because he could not afford the rent has been jailed - because he refused to move them from the picturesque village in which they lived.

Asa Pryke, 47, and his wife Gwen, 48, pitched the campsite after their nursery business went bust forcing them to leave their rented home.

But despite the fact that the two-acre plot has been in the Prykes' family for over 300 years, council chiefs told them they would still need planning permission, even to set up camp.

The couple and their three teenage children turned to the council for help but say they were only offered a flat that was too small to house a family of five.

Jailed: Asa Pryke, 47, and his wife Gwen, 48, moved into tents on their field in the the picturesque village of Dedham, Essex, when their day nursery business went under and they could no longer afford the rent on their home

Desperate and penniless, they say they had no choice but to move onto the only piece of land they owned.

There they have been living for the past 18 months in their small collection of tents and caravans.

Now, after losing a long and bitter battle to gain the planning permission, Mr Pryke has been handed a four-month jail sentence after refusing to move.

The devastated couple are convinced their plans for an eco-friendly £32,000 home on the field in the affluent village - that provided the backdrop for a host of paintings by the eminent British painter John Constable - angered local residents, leaving them with no chance of getting the green light.

Their solicitor had tried to argue moving them from the land, in an area of outstanding natural beauty, breached their human rights.

On the line: There they have been living for the past 18 months in their small collection of tents and caravans

Tent village: Desperate and penniless, Mr and Mrs Pryke say they had no choice but to move onto the only piece of land they owned - an empty field in the heart of 'Constable Country'

Desperate: A county court judge has now jailed Mr Pryke and also warned his wife that she would be put behind bars for four months if the field is not cleared. Mrs Pryke holds up the court letter sentencing her husband, right

Field of dreams: But despite the fact that the land has been in Mrs Pryke's family for over 300 years, Colchester Borough Council say they must still have planning permission, even to camp there

Mrs Pryke’s family has lived in the popular commuting village, since the 1600s and the couple were married at the local church.

But a county court judge has now jailed Mr Pryke and also warned his wife that she would be put behind bars for four months if the field is not cleared.

The couple were not jailed simultaneously because of their three teenage children.

Mrs Pryke, 48, fought back tears after hearing her husband would be starting his jail sentence.

She said: 'The judge told me I have got to reflect whilst Asa is in prison because when he is out, they could apply for a warrant and I could be jailed.

'Doers': Mr Pryke said they would rather 'stand on our own feet and live on our land than take taxpayers' money for housing support'

'It was so upsetting - we tried to say ‘how can you do such a thing and why do you think it is right?’

'The judge just told us he was upholding the law.'

Some residents living in the village have welcomed the ruling.

One said: asked not to be named 'This is a lovely area to live and people have been upset by the sight of the caravans and tents.

'The law is the law and although it may seem extreme for this gentleman to be jailed, it certainly could have been avoided.

'It’s sad to see what has happened to the family but really, one can only have so much sympathy because they were given a lot of warning of what was going to happen.'

The couple have thee children, Nicholas, 17, Rohan, 15 and Jody, 13,

Speaking before the ruling Mr Pryke, who is was working as a specialist insurance broker until his sentence, said: 'We are fighting to stay on our land and fighting for what we believe in.

'This country needs ‘doers’ to get out of the mess it is in, not just people who are happy just to take handouts.

'We would rather stand on our own feet and live on our land than take taxpayers’ money for housing support.

'How can making us homeless make any sense when we will be forced to live off state handouts?'

The couple were hoping to get planning permission from Colchester Borough Council for their eco-friendly home.

Mr Pryke added: 'We would even be prepared to build one home and then give land away for another for social housing.

'That is how committed we are to this project.

'We moved onto here to live in tents because we were desperate and did not want to be hold up in a council flat.

'Of course the laws mean we are forbidden from developing the land without planning permission but when the weather turned on us last winter and we were offered the loan of caravans, then we jumped at the chance because we did not want to freeze to death in the cold.'

The couple said they were only offered 'unsuitable' accommodation from the local council in flats and homes which are too small and they don’t want to be at the mercy of unscrupulous landlords.

Earlier this year, the couple were given four-month suspended prison sentences, suspended for a year for failing to comply with an earlier order to leave.

It is that sentence against Mr Pryke which has now been activated.

Tim Young, Colchester borough councillor in charge of planning, said: 'The council has gone through every route possible to assist and advise the family but it has gone to court.

'The judge has come up with a sensible judgement because the children are important in all this.'
