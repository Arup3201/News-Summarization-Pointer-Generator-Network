A Libyan security officer has claimed that he warned American diplomats about the possibility of violent unrest three days before the attack on the U.S. consulate which left the ambassador dead along with three others.

The country's president also says that the deadly raid in Benghazi was 'pre-planned' by Al Qaeda and other 'foreigners'.

However, the U.S. has hit back at that suggestion, with a top diplomat insisting the attack was 'a spontaneous - not a premeditated - response' to violence elsewhere.

Jamal Mabrouk, of the February 17th Brigade, told CNN
 that he and a battalion commander sat down with U.S. envoys to discuss 
the economy and security in the country, which has been going through a 
turbulent transition since the fall of Moammar Gaddafi last year.

According to Mabrouk, they told the 
diplomats that the precarious security situation was not beneficial for 
international business.

‘The situation is frightening, it scares us,’ Mabrouk said they told the U.S. officials. He would not say how they responded.

Mabrouk added that it was not the 
first time he has alerted foreigners to safety concerns in the face of 
the growing presence of armed jihadist groups in the Benghazi area.

Libyan President Mohammed el-Megarif,
 meanwhile, has said he believes the attackers are connected to Al Qaeda
 and used the protests at the consulate as a cover to attack on the 
anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

In an interview with NPR,
 Megarif said foreigners have been infiltrating his country over the 
past few months, which has been undergoing major changes since the 
uprising against the late dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi.

'We firmly believe that this was a 
precalculated, preplanned attack that was carried out specifically to 
attack the U.S. Consulate,' Megarif told NPR.

made in the U.S.

Call for action: Protesters in Lahore are 
demanding that the Pakistan government immediately end diplomatic 
relations with all Western countries and recall its envoys to protest 
the film

On CBS' Face the Nation,
 Megarif said that 'a few' of those who joined in the attack were 
foreigners, who had entered Libya 'from different directions, some of 
them definitely from Mali and Algeria.'

'The others are affiliates and maybe sympathizers,' he added.

But Susan Rice, America's ambassador 
to the United Nations, told ABC's This Week she believed the assault was
 the result of ad-hoc protests and had not been planned in advance.

'Our current best assessment, based 
on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what this 
began as, it was a spontaneous – not a premeditated – response to what 
had transpired in Cairo,' she said.

Ms Rice added that protests in Egypt against an American-made anti-Muslim video provided the catalyst for the violence in Libya.

'We believe that folks in Benghazi, a
 small number of people came to... the consulate to replicate the sort 
of challenge that was posed in Cairo,' she said.

'And then as that unfolded, it seems 
to have been hijacked by some individual clusters of extremists who came
 with heavier weapons... And it then evolved from there.'

The disagreement between the U.S. and
 Libya over the origins of the brutal raid could add to the tensions 
between the West and the Muslim world in the wake of the ongoing 
protests around the globe.

Denial: Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the UN, insisted that the attack was entirely spontaneous

Libyan President Mohammed el-Megarif said he believes Al Qaeda is behind the attack on the U.S. embassy that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens

U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other embassy employees were killed after a barrage of small arms, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars tore into the consulate buildings in Benghazi on Tuesday, the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

The room where the body of the ambassador was found was protected by a large door with steel bars; the windows had steel bars, CNN reported.

Stevens’ body was later recovered after looters broke into the room. It appears his security detail left him in the room while they clashed with the attackers.

The State Department has not released
 details about how Stevens died, although numerous media reports have 
said the ambassador was taken from the consulate to the Benghazi medical
 center by locals.

He arrived at the hospital, according to the reports, unresponsive and covered in soot from the fire. A doctor was unable to revive him and declared him dead, the reports said.

It has been reported that the assault on the American embassy that ended in the death of the envoy and thee other officials began simultaneously from three directions.

Slain: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed by protesters angry over a film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad

According to an embassy guard, heavy machine guns and rocket -propelled grenades were used by masked men who then threatened to kill him 'protecting the infidels.’

The February 17th Brigade -- a militia formed in the first days of the uprising against Gaddafi which has since become affiliated with Libya’s military - was closely involved in the rescue of the American staff trapped after the attack Tuesday night.

After the consulate was sacked, several Americans escaped to a safe-house in another part of Benghazi, but that location too came under attack.

Mabrouk said he received a call from an official in Tripoli who said he had been called by a ‘terrified’ American hiding at the safe house.

Mabrouk said the Brigade asked the Americans if they required assistance, but were told that while the situation was precarious, it was under control.

A few hours later, Mabrouk said he received another call from Tripoli about the arrival of a U.S. team at Benghazi airport that needed transport into the city.

He met the seven heavily armed Americans dressed in civilian clothing and conducted them to the safe house with an armed escort.

Upon the arrival of the newcomers in the city, they came under intense fire before their assailants fled.

Mabrouk’s statements come just days 
after the U.S. State Department has angrily denied claims that it had 
intelligence warning its consulate in Libya would be attacked 48 hours 
in advance.

Earlier
 this week, a spokesman has dismissed claims that the attacks were the 
result of a 'continuing security breach' and diplomats should have been 
warned before the attacks as 'completely wrong.'

New claims: A member of a Libyan security force said he had met with American diplomats three days before the deadly assault to warn them about the deteriorating situation in the country

The official told Politico: 'This is absolutely wrong. We are not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi was planned or imminent.'

The violent assault on the consulate in Benghazi started out as a demonstration against the film Innocence of Muslims, which reportedly was made in California by a filmmaker whose identity was not known at the time.

The Mail on Sunday has since exclusively revealed that Nakoiula Basseley Nakoula, an Egyptian-born Coptic Christian, has been named by the FBI as the director of the controversial film which ridicules the Prophet Mohammed.  

The release of the film online set 
off a firestorm in the Middle East, with Muslims throughout the region 
taking to the streets and staging violent protests against the U.S.

On
 Sunday, demonstrators in Afghanistan torched a U.S. flag and were heard
 shouting slogans denouncing America during a protest in the city of 
Herat.

A similar scene was 
captured in Turkey, where a group of about 50 protesters set a mock 
American flag on fire near the U.S. embassy in Ankara. 

Incitement: Al Qaida has urged Muslims around the world to step up their protests and kill more diplomats in Islamic countries

One
 protester read out a statement denouncing the U.S., praising protests 
that erupted in Libya, Cairo and Tunisia and calling on Turks to also 
rise up against insults to the Prophet Mohammed.

Protests
 against the anti-Muslim film also continued in cities across Pakistan 
on Sunday. The Frontier Post reported that rallies were staged the 
cities of Kotli and Lahore.

Meanwhile, in Karachi, police were forced to use tear gas and aerial firing to disperse a protest rally by the Islamist party Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen outside the U.S. consulate. 

The U.S. has ordered diplomats' families and non-essential staff to leave its embassies in Sudan and Tunisia following revelations by the Libyan government that Al Qaeda might have been responsible for the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

In a statement, the terrorist network has urged Muslims around the world to step up their protests and kill more diplomats in Islamic countries.

U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta predicted that
 the turmoil raging across the Muslim world is likely to continue into 
the days ahead, but said the violence appears to
 be leveling off.
