For decades they came to espouse their vile  politics, but now locals in a town in Germany have tricked neo-Nazi marchers into raising €10,000 to help them drop out of right-wing extremism.

The protesters gather annually in Wunsiedel in Bavaria to visit the grave of Rudolph Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy. This year, residents decided to donate €10 for every metre the marchers walked.

Rights versus Rights (Rechts gegen Rechts), the counter-protest by the locals, are donating their funds to Exit Germany. The programme aids people who want to escape fascist movements.

Right-wing gatherers travel annually to Wunsiedel in Bavaria to pay their respects to the grave of Rudolph Hess - but this year they unwittingly donated to a programme which helps people escape from extremism

One organiser, Fabian Wichmann, told German news agency DPA: ‘We want to show what else you can do, what other courses of action you have.

‘You can do more than just block the street or close the shutters.’

Campaigners in Wunsiedel only unveiled their novel approach to the neo-Nazis when the some 250 marchers arrived last Saturday to pay their respects to Hess and tip their hat to the Third Reich.

Campaigners threw confetti, gave out bananas and even hung out brightly coloured banners with humorous slogans such as ‘if only the Führer knew!” and “Mein Mampf' (my munch) in their protest against neo-Nazis

The marchers, decked out in black and camouflage clothing, were even greeted with a sign thanking them for their ‘donations’ in the anti-extremist protest encouraging them to move on.

Hitler’s deputy Hess was once buried in Wunsiedel – prompting the neo-Nazis to take part in the annual pilgrimage in their tribute to one of the architects of Nazi Germany.

Extremists travel from all over Europe for their annual right-wing tribute to Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy

Hess’s remains were exhumed and his grave destroyed in 2011, but far right extremists still flock from all over Europe every year. Despite complaints, locals have been unable to stop the marches.

EXIT-Germany is an initiative founded by criminologist and former police detective Bernd Wagner and the former neo-Nazi leader Ingo Hasselbach.

The group, which is the brainchild of German magazine Stern, was set up in 2000 to help members of neo-Nazi groups and other right wing elements to leave behind their venomous beliefs.
