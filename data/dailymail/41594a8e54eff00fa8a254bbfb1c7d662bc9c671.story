Budget airlines have been cleared to carry on imposing punishing baggage charges on passengers.

A number of companies, such as Ryanair, have levied increasingly high fees in a policy to discourage travellers from bringing large bags that need to go in the hold.

The ploy angers holidaymakers, but helps airlines cut their airport baggage handling fees and speeds up the turnaround of their aircraft. They also claim that the policy cuts fuel costs.

Extra fee: The court's ruling is a big win for European budget airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair

It also allows budget airlines to keep headline fares down – which is the key to attracting customers in the first place.

Europe’s
 top court has now sided with them rather than travellers, following 
legal action by a consumer body in Spain against the airline Vueling, a 
sister brand of British Airways.

The
 case was triggered four years ago when a Spanish woman complained about
 a 40 euro – £31.50 – charge for checked-in luggage on a trip between La
 Coruna and Amsterdam.

The 
Galician Consumer’s Institution sided with her and fined Vueling 
3,000euro – £2,360 – on the basis Spanish law did not allow any baggage 
surcharge.

Vueling appealed 
and the Spanish courts asked the European Court of Justice to decide on 
the matter. Yesterday, the ECJ said charges to check baggage into the 
hold were justified because of the extra costs this generates for an 
airline.

The EU's top court said a Spanish consumer court was wrong to fine Vueling Airlines for charging a fee 

The news will be 
welcomed by the likes of Ryanair which charges a fee to check a large 
bag into the hold, rising to as much as £75 during peak periods such as 
Christmas or the summer holidays.

Ryanair
 said: ‘We note the ruling and continue to abide fully with EU law. Just
 20 per cent of our customers travel with checked-in baggage, while all 
Ryanair customers can bring two free bags on board.’

In
 its ruling, the European Court said travellers could not assume that an
 airline should be expected to carry their bags free of charge in the 
hold as part of the package when buying a ticket. ‘Spanish law requiring
 airlines to carry checked-in baggage without a surcharge infringes EU 
law,’ it said.

‘The 
processing and storing of checked-in baggage is likely to lead to 
additional costs for the airline, which is not the case for carrying 
hand baggage.

The EU court said a Spanish consumer court was wrong to fine Vueling Airlines after a passenger complained

‘Furthermore, 
the extent of the liability of the carrier for damage to baggage is 
greater when baggage is checked in than when it is not.

‘The
 price to be paid for the transportation of checked baggage of 
passengers can be an optional extra cost. Such a service cannot be 
considered mandatory or essential for the transport of such passengers.

‘It
 is not inconceivable that some passengers prefer to travel without 
checked baggage, provided that reduces the price of your ticket.’

The
 ruling should not affect major carriers such as British Airways or 
Virgin Atlantic because carrying hold luggage is included in their 
ticket prices.
