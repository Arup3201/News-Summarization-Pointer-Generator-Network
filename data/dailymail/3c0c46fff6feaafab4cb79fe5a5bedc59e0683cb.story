Whatever you do, don’t mention fried chicken.

Yes, The Bluegrass State serves visitors everything from fried catfish to succulent steaks and pecan pie, but it has so much more to offer than food.

‘We love rivers, mountains, old men, pretty horses and fast women,’ reads a tongue-in-cheek poster in a cafe window in Frankfort, the state capital, a gracious old-world town ringed by meadowland, pine forests and stud farms.

America at its most picturesque: Kentucky's appeal is encapsulated by the pretty town of Midway

Kentucky is the horse capital of America, and the highlight of the year is the running of the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May. But as we drive around the state, savouring the soft contours of the landscape, we glimpse an unchanging rural world.

A plump, white horse grazes a meadow of buttercups. We pass a Baptist church, some white clapboard houses, a farmer and his dog, and a fluttering Stars and Stripes flag that has seen better days. An old woman sits knitting on her veranda, her head bent in concentration.

She could be Abraham Lincoln’s mother.

The green green grass of home: The central regions of Kentucky are dotted with ranches and horse farms

The great 
man was born in Hodgenville, Kentucky, and embodied the sturdy common 
sense of the region, light years from the cosmopolitan sophistication of
 New York and California.

The
 best-known modern Kentuckian is Muhammad Ali who, 50 years ago, became 
world heavyweight champion for the first time. There’s a museum 
dedicated to him in downtown Louisville, Kentucky’s largest city.

Then there’s the terrific General George Patton Museum of Leadership at Fort Knox, a genuinely inspirational place, especially for anyone interested in World War II.

More than 90 per cent of the world’s bourbon is now produced in Kentucky and, whether you like the drink, or prefer Scotch, you should not miss a visit to one of the legendary distilleries on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.

A thunder of hooves: America thrills to the spectacle of the Kentucky Derby, every May

One of the largest and best is Jim Beam,
 which not only gives an excellent overview of the bourbon-making 
process, but evokes the colourful history of the industry, from its 
primitive origins to the dark days of Prohibition and up to the present.

The tour ends with a full-on bourbon-tasting of which my memories are hazy.

Bardstown, in the heart of bourbon country, is small-town America at its gracious best. Nobody rushes, cats sleep on porches.

Our accommodation in Bardstown is the Beautiful Dreamer B&B, opposite the 19th-century mansion which inspired the song My Old Kentucky Home, a cornball classic that has been bringing tears to Kentuckian eyes for more than 150 years.

A light on the horizon: Louisville, Kentucky's biggest city, perches on the banks of the Ohio River

It was written by Stephen Foster, often described as the father of American music.

The next morning, we see yet another side to Kentucky at the Bernheim Arboretum, an exquisite little nature reserve, with hiking trails, a wealth of bird life and spring flowers in teeming profusion. It makes a great finale to a great trip - and not a sniff of Kentucky Fried Chicken all week.
