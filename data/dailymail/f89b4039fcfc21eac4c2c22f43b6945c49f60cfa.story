The lead singer of a popular Argentinian rock band has died after getting a massive electric shock as he opened his set to promote the band's first album.

Faulty wiring on his microphone led to Agustin Briolini, from Krebs, getting an electrical shock to the head as he performed at the Theatre of the Sun, in the city of Villa Carlos Paz.

Briolini was moving towards the microphone during the band's opening song, when the accident happened.

Medics rushed to the 21-year-old's aid, but after spending an hour trying to revive him, the singer was taken to hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.  

Briolini's bandmates, drummer Diego Regali, 21, and guitarist Gustavo Escober, 22, said they could not believe it when they saw the singer collapse on stage, let alone when they were later told he had died. 

Pico Moyano, the lead singer of Iceberg, who also performed on the night, said he was shocked that an accident like this could still occur.

He said 'It really defies belief. We are in the 21st century and these sort of things should simply not happen, I find it absolutely incredible.'

Mr Mayano said Krebs had been 'rising fast' and had developed a huge following locally, 'they were doing some great work'.

The lead singer of another band that performed on the night Briolini died said the 21-year-old's band was 'rising fast' and had a huge following locally, 'they were doing some great work'

Just before he died Mr Briolini had explained how music was his life and how the band's name had come from the word for cellular respiration.

He said: 'For us, making music is a cyclical process. The music we make we give to people who get energy as a result, they accept that energy and they transform it, and what they create to be sent back to us, we in turn except and throw it back again with even more power in our music. It is a cycle with people and art.'
