Arsene Wenger joked on Thursday that he hoped Thierry Henry would play a half for Arsenal against New York Red Bulls after travelling to America with just one recognised striker in his squad.

Arsenal went down 1-0 to the MLS side in the early hours of Sunday morning with Wenger opting to start with Tomas Rosicky in an advanced attacking role, while Chuba Akpom, the only out and out forward in the party, came on at the break.

Although it is still early days in terms of Arsenal's pre-season, with many senior stars still absent due to their participation in the later stages of the World Cup, Wenger has still not resolved the issue that dogged his side for much of last season: their lack of reliable experienced cover for Olivier Giroud.

Step up: Mesut Ozil could be among the players to benefit from a false nine role at Arsenal next season

Know how: Alexis Sanchez will have experienced playing without an attacker at Barcelona

Experience: Theo Walcott has played as a central attacker for Arsenal before and performed well

Embarrassment of riches: Arsene Wenger must find a way to solve Arsenal's lack of strikers

The Gunners will contest the Emirates Cup on August 2 and 3 before the real business begins in the Community Shield against Manchester City on August 10 and then in the Premier League a week later meaning Wenger must already be giving serious consideration to formations which will allow him to get the maximum out of his exciting squad next season.

In stark contrast to his striking options Wenger boasts an embarrassment of riches in attacking midfield, where he can call upon Rosicky, Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Theo Walcott among others.

Ozil will return buoyed by Germany's success at the World Cup and eager to silence critics who have claimed he failed to fully justify his price tag during his first season in England.

Sanchez, another big-money signing, will arrive keen to make an instant impact after being deemed surplus to requirements at Barcelona, while Walcott's return from injury, expected early-to-mid-September, will see the England international faced with real competition for his place in the team.

A good fit: Incorporating a false nine would suit the games of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski

Unfamiliar: Midfielder Tomas Rosicky led the Arsenal attack against New York Red Bulls

In a squad which also includes Santi Cazorla, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Serge Gnabry and Lukas Podolski, Wenger could have to think hard about how to get the best of the talent at his disposal while keeping everyone happy.

The need for more depth up front is crucial if Arsenal are to mount a proper challenge for the Premier League title. Giroud shouldered the responsibility well last season, scoring 16 league goals, but that burden must be shared if Wenger's side's challenge are not going to fall away at a crucial stage of the season again.

A serious option for Arsenal is to employ a false nine, an interchangeable forward threat that would allow Wenger to really maximise the players in his team.

Winner: Germany's lack of traditional strikers didn't stop Joachim Low leading them to win the World Cup

Strikerless system: Ozil was part of Germany's free-scoring side which thrashed Brazil 7-1 and Portugal 4-0

VIDEO German trio to miss start of season - Wenger  

Employed with great success by Spain and Barcelona in recent years, and given a revamp by Germany at the World Cup, the role requires its candidate to be comfortable in the attacking third, dragging defenders out of position and bringing team-mates into play - a system Arsenal players are already well versed in.

Joachim Low, like Wenger, is a manager blessed with countless attacking options but not many out and out strikers in the traditional sense.

The Germany coach used this to great effect in Brazil as his side won the World Cup with Ozil in the team, thrashing Portugal 4-0 and Brazil 7-1 along the way, showing that a shortage of strikers doesn't have to be a shortcoming.

Given the players currently available to Wenger this system could bring the best out of Ozil, Sanchez and Walcott and really give them the platform to thrive like it did for Germany's new generation of stars.

And unlike in the striking department, Wenger would be able to factor in injuries and squad rotation without the standard dropping off.

Although it is not clear if Wenger intends to continue his experimentation with this system when he integrates Ozil and Sanchez back into his squad in the next fortnight, it is obvious that he needs to find a proper Plan B to ensure the raw talent of Yaya Sanogo isn't the only back-up to Giroud.

The answer will come when Ozil, Sanchez and Walcott are fully fit and vying for a spot in the team. Then he will have another attacking headache on his hands, although this time a considerably more comfortable one.
