Billy Connolly discovered he had Parkinson's disease after a chance encounter with an Australian fan who spotted him walking strangely, the comedian has revealed.

The 71-year-old Scottish star told how a Tasmanian doctor diagnosed him on the spot after seeing him walking through a hotel lobby.

The man approached the comedian and told him to see his doctor right away as his gait suggested he was showing early signs of the illness.

Last September, Connolly announced that he had had surgery for prostate cancer and was being treated for early symptoms of Parkinson's, a degenerative brain disorder.

Speaking in detail for the first time about his health battles, Connolly insisted he never considered dying.

He told how he was staying at a hotel in Los Angeles preparing to appear on Conan O'Brien's chat show when he met the concerned fan.

In a US radio interview, he said: 'It was the strangest thing of all.

'I was doing Conan O'Brien's thing and they put me up in the Sportsmen's Lodge in Los Angeles.

'I was walking through the lobby and every time I had gone through there was a crowd of boys and girls and a couple of adults.

'It turned out they were dancers from Australia.

'The guy who was in charge of them came over to me one day and said 'Billy, I'm a big fan, I'm from Tasmania'.

'He said, 'I'm a surgeon and I have been watching you walking, you have a strange gait'. That was the way he put it.

'He said 'You're showing distinct signs of early onset Parkinson's disease, see your doctor'.

'I think it was the way I held myself when I was walking.

'Then they did blood tests and various other little bits and pieces and told me I had it.'

Connolly also told how his prostate cancer was diagnosed during a routine examination.

He had surgery in America and was given the all-clear in December 2013.

He said: 'It was found by the routine finger up the bum test.

'When I was told by the doctor I had cancer I said to him, 'I've never been told that before'. Usually you are only told once.

'The doctor in the hospital, the one who operated on me, said to me 'the good news is you're not going to die'.

'I said that it never crossed my mind that I might. It's that arrogance thing, I think I'm going to live forever.'

The Glaswegian comic said he was taking a relaxed approach to his illness and joked that he had always suffered from memory loss, a symptom of Parkinson's, during stand-up routines.

He added: 'I prefer not to give it any notice. I don't see much shaking going on and I have always had a sh**** memory anyway.

'I have forgotten things my entire career. I was taking drugs to control the Parkinson's but I'm not on them anymore.

'The doctor said the side effects were stronger than the effects. I never noticed any side effects but he told me they could include a deep interest in sex and gambling.

'In terms of treatment I think some of the stem cell stuff is very promising but they have a lot of problems legally getting it through.'

Connolly is due to return to the stage next month when he plays five gigs in America before undertaking a tour of New Zealand in April and May.

He has vowed to continue performing and said he has no plans to retire.

Last week, Connolly insisted he didn't want to get involved in the Scottish independence debate and said he would not vote as he would be in New Zealand when the vote is held.
