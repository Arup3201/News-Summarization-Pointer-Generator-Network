Three generations of the same family, including two grandparents with a combined age of 138, who brought an estimated £1 million of heroin into the West Country have been jailed.

Cornish Grandparents Michael, 75, and Teresa Wood, 63, helped two of their three sons and their grandson run a heroin supply chain from Liverpool to Devon and Cornwall, which was disrupted by a lengthy and sophisticated police surveillance operation.

It resulted in the couple being stopped as they drove from Torbay back to Bodmin with £50,000 worth of heroin in Mrs Wood's shopping bag alongside the Cornish pasties she had bought for their supper. They were jailed for six and four years respectively.

A police search has been launched for one of the key men in the conspiracy who jumped bail a few days before he was due to join 15 others in the dock at Exeter Crown Court.

Stephen Blundell, who was the initial mastermind behind the supply chain, is now on the run after Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, issued a warrant for his arrest.

A police operation codenamed Raby spent two years tracking the movements of couriers as they made 40 trips from the North West to the South West.

Drugs squad officers have no certain way of knowing how much was brought each time, but believe each consignment was worth about £25,000 at street prices, making a total of £1 million.

Grandson Jake Wood, 24, (left) received four years and son Ivan Wood, 43, (right) received nine years in the culmination of an 18-month investigation, codenamed Operation Raby, that saw 39 people arrested, heroin with a street value of £125,000 confiscated and £20,000 cash seized

Grandfather Michael Wood was watched as he made 14 trips from Bodmin to Torbay to pick up drugs and his wife was carrying half a kilogram, worth £50,000 when they were stopped as they left the resort, meaning he could have carried £700,000 worth in all.

The police broke up the conspiracy twice but it was so profitable that it carried on under different leadership with control moving from one Liverpool family to another.

Judge Gilbert praised the efforts of the police and forensic service as he handed down severe jail sentences on the conspirators, including five members of the Wood family who were jailed for 29 years and six months in total.

In sentencing the Wood family, he said: 'Ivan, you had a leading 
role in all three conspiracies, with the distribution in Bodmin being 
organised by you. You continued to run it after the arrest of Paul 
Corrigan in August 2010 and your parents in October of that year.

'Michael: you are 75 but were a very busy courier for your son, making 
some 14 trips to Torbay in three months.

'Teresa: you played a lesser 
role but the text messages you sent and received showed you were fully 
aware of what was going on.

'Jake: you are 24 and played a lesser role. Calvin: your role was significant but I assess it as lesser than your brother."

The main organiser in Torbay, Mark Gale (left), aged 41, of Torquay, was jailed for eight years, while one of the gang leaders Craig Corrigan (right) aged 23, was jailed for nine years

Couriers Keith Anderson (left), 30, and John Pogue (right), 27, received
six years for their role in the plan to flood the West Country with the
deadly class A

Mr Ray Tully, prosecuting, said the drugs supply chain stretched from 
Liverpool to Torbay at first with drugs being moved on to Bodmin.

He said the initial organiser was Liverpool-based Steven Blundell, who 
was helped by his cousin Paul and used Torbay resident Mark Gale as his 
local coordinator.

The operation moved on with brothers Paul and Craig Corrigan taking the 
leading role in Liverpool and employing a string of couriers to take the
heroin to Torbay or Bodmin.

Mr Tully said: 'The Crown's position is that Gale was the principle 
coordinator of the activities at this end, being responsible for 
organising deliveries, storage and onward distribution. He was an 
integral part of both conspiracies."

Michael Wood, was jailed for six and a half years; his wife Teresa, aged 63, and grandson Jake were both jailed for four years.

Ivan Wood, aged 43, was jailed for nine years and his brother Calvin, aged 41, for six.

Mark
Gale, aged 41, of Torquay, was jailed for eight years and street dealer
Richard Heywood, who sold drugs from Newton Abbot, for three years and 
eight months.

Craig Corrigan, aged 23, was jailed for nine years. Couriers John Pogue, aged 27, Keith Anderson, aged 30, and Vincent Toohey, aged 29, all from Liverpool, were jailed for six, six and four and a half years respectively.

Money launderers Ryan Morgan, aged 29, and Brian McDonald, aged 48, also from Liverpool, were jailed for two years and 16 months respectively.

Key conspirator Stephen Blundell is on the run and he and his cousin Paul Blundell will be sentenced later.

Paul Corrigan is already serving a five year jail term for his part in setting up the supply chain.

All the defendants admitted conspiracy to supply class A drugs with the exception of Teresa Wood and Mark Gale, who denied the charge and were convicted.

Judge Gilbert told the defendants: 'The reality is that those who involve themselves in the dealing and supply of class A drugs are involved in very serious criminal activity and must expect custody.

'This must have been a complicated investigation for the police and I commend the officers involved'.
