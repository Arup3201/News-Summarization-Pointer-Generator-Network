A young woman left paralysed after a car accident eight years ago has been able to stand and hug her boyfriend for the first time - thanks to bionic legs.

Jordan Bone was just 15 when she suffered a broken neck and could not move from the chest down.

She thought she would never walk again following the crash in 2005, but now she has taken her first steps and says: 'It's an amazing feeling.'

Brave: Jordan Bone who was left paralysed after a car crash in 2005, with her mother

A bionic suit strapped on over Jordan's clothes allowed her to stand and embrace her mother and boyfriend. The technology uses battery-powered 
motors to lift the user from a sitting position and then mechanically 
move their legs to walk.

Walking: Jordan stands up with her bionic legs for the first time since a car crash left her paralysed

Jordan, from South Wootton, Norfolk, managed to make 645 steps with the aid of a walking frame.

She said: 'When I was younger,it seemed too hard. Now I feel determined and I just want to get my body as strong and healthy as it can be.

'It's an incredible piece of equipment. I felt high up.

'The best part was being able to give my mum and my boyfriend a hug while standing up. All of us felt so happy. I feel driven and excited.'

Jordan, who runs her own vintage clothing shop is having physiotherapy sessions at Prime Physio in Cambridge to build her strength and help her learn how to use her new legs.

She is also launching a road safety campaign aimed at young drivers.

She added: 'My project is to make young drivers think about the choices they make on the roads.

'I want them to realise they are in control of a vehicle and they need to think about the passengers, pedestrians, themselves and other drivers.

'You only have one life and you should make the most of it. If I could save one life, then I will know I have done my job.It will make me feel amazing.'

The bionic suit was developed by Ekso Bionics in Berkeley, California, and was the first real alternative for paraplegics in terms of mobility since the invention of the wheelchair.

Just like with bicycles and skis, users have to learn how to make the Ekso,which cost around Â£100,000 each, work for them.

But once they have mastered the skills the technology promises the most realistic human gait ever created.
