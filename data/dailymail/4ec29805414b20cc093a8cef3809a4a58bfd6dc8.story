Three GCSE pupils from a top school have been taken to hospital after collapsing during break-time after smoking a 'legal high' narcotic.

The two boys and one girl aged 15 and 16 were among six pupils who took a quantity of herbal mixture Pandora's Box after it was sneaked into the school by another girl who boasted on Facebook: 'Let's all get high.'

The teenagers collapsed after taking the mixture which often marketed as 'herbal ecstasy'.

They were taken to hospital by ambulance after they began vomiting and have all been kept in for observation.

Headmaster Stephen Tierney wrote a  stern letter to parents

A number of other pupils and the girl who supplied it were treated by paramedics at St Mary's Catholic College in Blackpool, Lancashire, but did not need to go to hospital.

Today an investigation is underway at the 1,334 pupil voluntary aided school - one pupil has already been disciplined with others facing possible further action.

Lancashire Police are also investigating Wednesday morning's incident.

In a stern letter to parents headmaster Stephen Tierney said: 'Please would you take a moment to speak to your child about the importance of keeping themselves safe, including not taking medicines, pills or legal substances which have not been prescribed for them.

'Whilst the substance taken by the students was legal, the college considers the matter unacceptable and will now look at whether disciplinary action should arise out of this issue.'

The drug 
was brought into class after a girl bought the drug over the internet 
and sent a message to her friends on Facebook inviting classmates to 
join in saying they were all going to get high.

But in between morning classes on Wednesday the pupils began collapsing and had to be helped by teachers.

Pandora's 
Box which is also sold under the name Clockwork Orange or Salvia and 
features a picture of an evil 'Devil skull' is a cannabis type drug 
usually sold in herbal smoking mixtures.

Inhaling the herbal drug produces a ‘legal high’ which experts say mimics the effects of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and lasts up to ten minutes.

Side effects include agitation, paranoia, increased heart rate, aggression, various levels of consciousness and vomiting.

Drug experts warn it can trigger psychotic episodes, particularly in young people and those with mental health problems.

It was linked to the death of Ryan Santanna, a 21-year-old film student who fell from a balcony in New York after smoking it in 2011.

Harry Shapiro of the charity DrugScope said that, at high doses, salvia has similar effects to LSD, triggering hallucinations and distorting time.

'There is the danger with hallucinogenic drugs that people can injure themselves because they are seeing something that isn’t there,’ he added.

‘There is the very odd case of people who believe they can fly. And, of course, people can just get scared by whatever it is that they see.’

In his letter Mr Tierney added: 'Three
 Key Stage 4 students took a legal substance which caused them to become
 very ill and as a precaution we sent them immediately to hospital.

'The
 substance was brought onto the College site by one student. The 
preliminary investigation has shown that it was sourced from a Facebook 
page and mobile number.

'The purchase of it was organised from home, the night before, via social media. The use of social media in this incident left a clear information trail which we now have.'

One student at the school said: 'We heard that one of the girls sent a message on Facebook saying she had got the drugs and that they should all get high the following day.

'They thought it was great but they soon became ill and they were found by teachers. We heard six pupils were taking the drug. It's unbelievable. St Mary's is a very good school and to hear about pupils taking drug here is unheard of.'

Former pupils include the Nolan sisters,
 DCI Banks actor Stephen Tomkinson, disgraced tycoon Owen Oyston and the
 late defence QC George Carman.

Pandora's Box which is also sold under the name Clock Orange or Salvia and features a picture of an evil 'Devil skull' is a cannabis type drug usually sold in herbal smoking mixtures.

Side effects include agitation, paranoia, increased heart rate, aggression, various levels of consciousness and vomiting.

Last November Essex Police issued a 
warning about the dangers of Pandora's Box after two boys aged 16 and 19
 were found collapsed in Southend after purchasing the drug from stores 
in the town.

Both were treated in hospital but later discharged.

Today
 Lancashire Police said in a statement: 'Police received a call from the
 Ambulance Service at around 11am Wednesday, April 7th following the 
report of a 15 year old pupil taking a substance believed to be a legal 
high at St Mary's Catholic College.

Easily available: Legal drugs such as
these can be bought cheaply online and in shops

Salvia was linked to the death of Ryan Santanna, a 21-year-old film student who fell from a balcony in New York after smoking it in 2011

'Three pupils from the school were subsequently taken to hospital as a result of taking the substance where they were treated.

'We are working with the school to establish what has happened and to confirm exactly what the substance in question is.'

In America, the drug was linked to the death of 17-year-old A-grade student Brett Chidester in 2006.

It was also linked to the death of Ryan Santanna, a 21-year-old film student who fell from a balcony in New York after smoking it in 2011.

Student Jo Puddle, 19, from Kent, vowed never to use Salvia again after smoking it once.

She said: ‘You don’t know where you are, you don’t know who you are. That feeling  is horrible. It lasts for about five minutes, but the fear stays with you for about half an hour.

'I would not recommend it. I’ve never heard of anyone who enjoyed it.’

Last July a 16-year-old boy was arrested today for grabbing a stranger's baby and throwing it to the pavement while high Salvia.
