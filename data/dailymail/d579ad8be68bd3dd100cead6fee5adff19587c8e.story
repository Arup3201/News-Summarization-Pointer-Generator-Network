Yaya Toure says Manchester City can still win the Premier League title if they win all their remaining fixtures as he branded criticism of him ‘b******’.

Speaking after captaining his country to the Africa Cup of Nations title, Toure, who has been criticised for some of his performances in the tournament, said he was ready to return to City duty.

But with the club seven points behind Chelsea, the Ivorian star knows it will not be easy.

‘With my confidence I know football is not about one game or two games, especially in the Premier League,’ he said.

‘We have 38 games and if we want to achieve it (retaining the title) we have to win all the games.

‘I know it is difficult but now I have to go back and do my duty again.’

Toure scored his penalty during an epic shootout that saw goalkeeper Boubacar Barry net the winning spot-kick as Ivory Coast won 9-8.

And he used the win to hit out at his critics, particularly those in the English press, as he insisted he bends over backwards to help his team.

Toure, pictured with Aleksandar Kolarov, has scored nine goals for Man City so far this season 

‘When I was in Manchester people were criticising me, about a lot of things.

‘Sometimes when you say the truth about football, people don’t listen. Especially you guys from the newspaper. You have to be objective and you have to say the true things.

‘I’ve always been the guy who puts his a**e in his head and does everything to try and do the best for the team. Sometimes, I know, I can’t be credited for that, but it’s part of football.

But I think my job is to try and do my best. I will sometimes get a little bit upset with some comments, from people who sit in front of the TV, and try and say like they understand football more, and sometimes I want to say ‘b******t’.
