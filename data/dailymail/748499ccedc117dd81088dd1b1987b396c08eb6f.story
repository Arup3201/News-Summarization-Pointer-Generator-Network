The names of the three Canadian police officers who were killed in a shooting rampage have been identified and the gunman has now been charged with their murders.

Justin Bourque terrorized the town of Moncton starting at around 7.20pm Wednesday when he opened fire and killed three Royal Canadian Mounted Police, whose names were released Friday morning after their next of kin were notified.

Three constables- David Ross, 32, Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, and Douglas James Larche, 40- were killed in the shooting.

Tragic: Constable 'Dave' Ross, 32, seen here on his wedding day with his wife Rachael, was one of the three slain officers who were fatally shot on Wednesday night in Moncton

Cut short: The couple had a young son and Constable Ross joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2009

Honored: Douglas James Larche, 40, was one of the slain constables and received a commendation in 2008 for saving an unconscious baby (left) and the third victim was Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, who was born in France but grew up in Canada (right)

Two other officers- Constables Éric Stéphane Dubois and Marie Darlene Goguen- were injured in the shootings and rushed to a local hospital for surgery but neither condition was life-threatening.

Constable Dubois was released Thursday afternoon and Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown said that he met with Constable Goguen in the hospital yesterday evening.

The manhunt for Bourque only ended in the early hours of Friday morning, when the 24-year-old was caught shortly after midnight.

'Justin came out with his hands up, and he said, "I'm done,"' resident Michelle Thibodeau told the CBC after she saw the arrest occur in her backyard.

'I'm done,' a witness heard him say to police.

Residents in much of Moncton- which has a population of nearly 70,000- were told to stay indoors during much of the manhunt that started Wednesday night but one person called in a tip to police that led to Bourque's arrest.

The tip directed police towards a wooded area in a residential part of the city where they found Bourque hiding out.

He
 turned himself over without incident and did not have any of the 
weapons- including two long guns and a bow and arrow- that he was seen 
carrying in earlier sightings from the beginning of the ordeal.

Further investigation found that the weapons were hidden close by and have since been taken away by police.

Bourque was transported to the city's courthouse on Friday afternoon and charged with three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He does not have to undergo a psychological evaluation. He is due back in court in early July.

'Fortunately
 most people will never have to experience what our officers have gone 
through in the last two days,' RCMP commanding officer Roger Brown said 
Friday morning. 

Heartbreaking: The shooting was the deadliest attack on the Canadian police force in almost a decade and RCMP officials Roger Brown (left) and Marlene Snowman (right) became emotional in every press conference about the ordeal, including this morning (pictured)

Support: The police officials praised the public for being helpful by turning on their outdoor lights to help the officers during the nighttime searches and now many have asked to donate to funds for the relatives of the slain officers

'I can't dig deep enough to explain the sadness that we all feel.'

Few details have been released about the slain officers, but a clearer picture is beginning to emerge.

Constable 'Dave' Ross was recently 
married and has a young son. He had been serving with the RCMP since he 
graduated from the police academy in 2009.

His
 cousin Lucinda Ross posted about the shooting on her Facebook profile 
early Thursday morning- a full day before the police officially 
confirmed his role in the incident.

'My cousin, a police top dog, passionate about his work, died while doing his functions,' she wrote in French.

'All of my thoughts are with his wife and their son and all of their family. Rest in Peace, Dave.'

Constable Fabrice Georges Gevaudan hailed from Boulogne-Billancourt, France.

Killer: Justin Bourque, 24, has officially been named the suspect and was charged on Friday

Armed and dangerous: When he was captured, Bourque did not have any of these weapons on his person but they were found near where he was hiding out in the woods

In custody: Armed officers escorted the vehicle driving Bourque to the courthouse on Friday afternoon

The third officer, Constable Douglas James Larche, was a respected member of the force and received a commander's commendation for saving the life of an unconscious baby in 2008 in Moncton.

Funeral arrangements have not yet been released and Commissioner Brown said that a fund will be established for the children of the slain officers. Aside from Constable Ross, it is not clear which other victims were fathers.

'It has been a very challenging 30 hours or more for the officers who worked around the clock to get this done,' RCMP superintendent Marlene Snowman said at a press conference Friday morning.

'It will take some time to heal but together we will get there. None of us can be prepared for this type of situation.'
