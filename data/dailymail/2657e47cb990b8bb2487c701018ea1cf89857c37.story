The incident will test Afghan President Hamid Karzai's relationship with the West

A Nato airstrike has killed eight members of the same family, including six children, Afghan officals have claimed.

The incident happened in the Paktia province, in the east of Afghanistan at around 8pm local time (5.30pm GMT), according to a spokesman for the area's provincial governor.

It comes weeks after Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that civilian casualties could undermine a strategic partnership with the West.

An anonymous Nato official disputed the claim, saying there was no evidence of any casualties.

The airstrike happened just a day after four Nato soldiers, including a British man from the 1st Battalion, were killed in separate bomb attacks, the same day Labour leader Ed Miliband visited Afghanistan.

Rohullah Samon, the spokesman for Patkia’s provincial governor, said civilian Mohammad Shafi was killed along with his wife and their six children in an airstrike in the village of Suri Khail in the Gurda Saria district.

'Shafi was not a Taliban. He was not in any opposition group against the government. He was a villager,' Mr Samon said.

'Right now, we are working on this case to find out the ages of their children and how many of them are boys and girls.'

Mr Karzai has sent a delegation to the village to investigate the incident.

Nato spokesman Lt Col Jimmie Cummings said: 'We acknowledge that coalition forces were conducting an operation in Paktia province against a large number of insurgents and we are also aware of the media reports today of civilian casualty allegations in that area.'

However, he did not confirm the reports.

The killings of civilians by foreign forces has been a major irritant in president Karzai’s relationship with partners including America and Britain.

Tensions rose earlier this year after Afghan officials reported that 18 civilians had died recently in four airstrikes in Logar, Kapisa, Badghis and Helmand provinces.

Civilian deaths caused by coalition troops have become a tense issue in Afghanistan

'If the lives of Afghan people are not safe, the signing of the strategic partnership has no meaning,' Karzai’s office said earlier this month.

Last year was the deadliest on record for civilians in the Afghan war. 3,021 were killed as insurgents ratcheted up violence with suicide attacks and roadside bombs.

The U.N. said over three quarters of civilian deaths were due to insurgent attacks, with just 14 percent as a result of actions by international and Afghan troops. One in ten cases had an unknown cause.

Elsewhere, two civilians were killed Sunday when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb in Marjah district of Helmand province in the south, provincial spokesman Daud Ahmadi said.
