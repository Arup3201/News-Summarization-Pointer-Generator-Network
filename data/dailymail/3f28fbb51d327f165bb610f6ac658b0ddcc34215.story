Amazon has come under fire from parents after the search term 'teen books for girls' was found to yield pornographic content.

Grandmother Martha Welter, from Chicago, Illinois, told NBC she first raised the issue in November, after discovering the 
disturbing results while browsing the website for a book to give to her 
12-year-old granddaughter.

'I was speechless,' Ms Welter said of her discovery. 'I just could not believe that this was happening.'

Disturbing: Last November, Chicago grandmother Martha Welter (pictured) was shocked to discover that a search on Amazon for 'teen books for girls' resulted in pornographic content

Ms Welter's initial search took place nearly four months ago, but searches today have not yielded the same results.

Indeed, a spokesman for the company has informed MailOnline: 'We have improved our search functionality since receiving this customer feedback, and will continue to do so.'

The grandmother stumbled upon the graphic books when she 
typed 'teen' into the Amazon search box, hoping to find a book for her granddaughter.

'I always give books to my grandkids for Christmas,' she told NBC at the time.

The search term 'teen books for girls' appeared in a drop-down list, and Ms Welter clicked on it.

While the first page of results yielded 
innocent titles like Pretty Little Liars, the second page was filled 
with 'adult, pornographic picture books,' she recounted. 'I can't even 
say the name of them.'

Some of the titles were Sexy College 
Girl Enjoying Herself, Hot Asian Girl and Wild Beach Night, according to
NBC, and the covers featured almost-naked and topless girls.

What's more, the unexpected search 
results did not appear to be a fluke - at the time, 91 of the 140 
suggested titles were graphic adult picture books.

Shocked, Ms Welter contacted a customer service representative who told her Amazon would follow up on her complaint.

But just yesterday, the raunchy titles still remained on the website.

On Tuesday, NBC reported that not only did the innocent search term still result in over 100 explicit images, but that even more graphic titles had been added since Ms Welter's original search.

But when MailOnline performed the same search today, the books did not include any inappropriate content.

'Kids can't go in an adult book store. They should not be able to find this stuff so easily online'

Ms Welter said her biggest concern is 
that children have access to these explicit images. 'They can't go in an
adult book store,' she said. 'They should not be able to find this 
stuff so easily online.'

Other angered parents have taken to NBC Chicago's Facebook page to share their similar concerns.

One commenter wrote: 'Amazon needs to
get rid of that ASAP! Shame on them!' while another posted: 'Thank you 
to caring parents, grandparents and others who take appropriate action 
and alert others as well.'

Indecent: Shockingly, the unexpected search results did not appear to be a fluke - at the time, 91 of the 140 suggested titles were graphic adult picture books

The issue was especially surprising since in Amazon's content guidelines, the company states that they do not accept 'pornography or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts'.

But the problem may be a result of the 
website's self-publishing service, which allows any user to upload their
stories and choose which keywords will be linked to them.

'The internet is totally the Wild West - anything goes, anything can be published'

Howard Tullman, president of Tribeca/Flashpoint Media Arts Academy and web-based media expert, explained that the internet is 'totally the Wild West. Anything goes, anything can be published.'

He said: 'The truth is, the volume of everything that is going on the web is beyond human capabilities to edit or review.'

Still, NBC noted that the URL address for each of the books included the term 'teen-books-for-girls', perhaps indicating that the titles were purposely geared towards teenagers.
