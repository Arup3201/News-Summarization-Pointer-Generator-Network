A model had her face slashed with a razor blade at a crowded Kentucky shopping mall by two girls, one of whom who smiled as they attacked her and was jealous she had dated her ex-boyfriend.

Victim Nicole Kyaw, 18, told the MailOnline today that she had previously not met the attackers but immediately recognized one as the love rival who had written her hostile messages on Facebook, ordering her to stop dating the man.

'One of the girls looked really familiar to me. She looked me dead in the eyes and I knew it was her instantly,' she said of her smiling attacker.

Jealousy: Kyaw was slashed by two girls whom she knows because her ex-boyfriend also used to date one of the attackers.

The assault took place Tuesday afternoon at the Fayette Mall in Lexington.

The girls, who Kyaw said called her job beforehand to learn when she was due to arrive, waited for her and tackled her to the ground and slashed an 'X' into her left cheek.

Stunning: Kyaw, seen here in one of her modelling shoots, had her face targeted.

Kyaw, who also suffered bruising around her eye and nose, said no one came to her aid.

'There were others standing around, watching it happen. No one even helped me get up or told them to stop.'

Kyaw, who has done some local modelling and has been recruited by a modelling firm, said the suspects targeted her face.

'All I remember is just trying to protect my head.'

Initially, she said, 'I didn't feel anything, I just knew I was bleeding.

'I thought I broke my nose, I didn't think they slashed my face up like this,' she said.

She said she was told her that the suspects called her job at the mall to find out what time her shift started.

'This is not a human act, its like an animal,' she said of her attackers. '

They have no right to think its okay to do this to me.It's not okay to do this to anyone.'

After the assault, Kyaw ran in a panic to her job at the mall.

'I had a bleeding face. I told my manager to call 911.'

She was rushed to a local hospital, where doctors told her she was lucky to be alive.

'They told me if they went down a little bit more on my neck I would be dead from losing so much blood,' she said.

She hopes the wounds won't leave permanent damage on her face as she hopes to pursue her passion in modelling.

Recovery: Kyaw said she hopes her wounds won't leave permanent scarring.

Kyaw said the attacker who previously messaged her had last written her 'about a month and a half ago.

'But I ignored her. I am not the problem type.'

She broke things off with the boyfriend, saying she didn't want the hassle his ex was causing.

'I was like, 'I'm done with this drama.'

Kyaw had never seen the other attacker before.

She said she's fearful that the suspects, who are still at-large, will hurt her again.

'I don't feel safe going anywhere now.'

Police told Lex18.com that they expect to make arrests shortly.
