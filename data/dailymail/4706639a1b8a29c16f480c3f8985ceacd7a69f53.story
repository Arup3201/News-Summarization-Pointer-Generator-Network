A ghostly image of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has appeared to workers digging out a new subway tunnel in Caracas.

The South American strongman's successor Nicolas Maduro claims a portrait of the 58-year-old, who died from cancer in March, revealed itself on a wall at 2am one morning earlier this week.

A workman managed to take a photograph of the 'apparition' on his mobile phone, El Universal reports him as saying, before the image then vanished back into thin air.

Appearance: A ghostly image of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has appeared to workers digging out a new subway tunnel in Caracas. A workman managed to take a photograph of the 'apparition' on his mobile phone,Â  before the image then vanished back into thin air

Maduro, who took control of the country in April, made the bizarre claim at a town hall meeting on Wednesday.

The 50-year-old told the crowd: 'Look at this figure that appeared to the workers, it can talk to them [...] a face [...] who is that face?'

'A look, it is a look of the homeland that is on all sides, including on phenomenons that do not have an explanation,' he added.

Vision: Maduro said he was inspecting excavation works on the city's new Metro Line 5 when one of the workmen showed him a picture

Skeptical: Many citizens have taken to social networking sites to slam Maduro's 'blatant propaganda' and 'shameless use of Chavez's memory' to win support

Maduro said he was inspecting excavation works on the city's new Metro Line 5 when one of the workmen showed him a picture.

He told the President they 'were working, and all of a sudden it appeared here [...] a figure.'

Maduro claimed the worker was able to take the snap before it disappeared from the wall.

'So just as it appeared, it disappeared, so you can see [...] that Chavez is everywhere, we are all Chavez,' Maduro added.

Not everyone believes the leader's claims, however.

Many citizens have taken to social networking sites to slam Maduro's 'blatant propaganda' and 'shameless use of Chavez's memory' to win support.

Funeral: A vehicle carries the coffin with the remains of late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is accompanied by thousands of mourners during a parade through the streets of Caracas in March
