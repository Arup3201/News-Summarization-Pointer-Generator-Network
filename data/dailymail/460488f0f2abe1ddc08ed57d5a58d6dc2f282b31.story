A family had a lucky escape when their dog started a fire after turning the oven on - to try and get some freshly-baked pies.

Tia, a seven-year-old Dogue de Bordeaux, sparked an emergency after she tried to get to the meat-filled pastries in the middle of the night.

The red-haired dog could smell two corned beef pies, which had been baked by her owner Adam Spurr, from Hartlepool, and placed on the back of the hob.

She tried to get at them by jumping up at the oven but she accidentally pushed one of the hob switches with her paw, and ignited one of the rings.

The first her owners knew of her antics were when they smelled smoke drifting up the stairs and into their bedroom as they slept at around 2.30am Tuesday.

Adam’s partner Emma Llewellyn, 25, smelled the fumes and woke him up. Emma raced to get their children Kai Spurr, seven, and three-year-old Theo Spurr, out of their beds, and Adam, 31, went downstairs to investigate.

He opened the kitchen door of their home and was met with plumes of thick smoke which were coming from the pies on the oven.

He managed to fight his way through the wall of smoke and remove the smouldering pies from the kitchen.

The family called 999 and within minutes fire brigade and ambulance crews arrived, with paramedics checking over Adam, who had inhaled a lot of smoke.

Adam said: 'We’ve been very lucky. We were really shocked when it dawned on us what was happening, I’m just so glad that we’re all alright because it could have been a different story.

'I’m really surprised Tia is still alive because the smoke in the kitchen was unbelievable, you basically couldn’t see in front of you at all.

'Tia jumps up at the workbenches all the time, that’s why the pies were at the back covered in tea towels, but she’s obviously still had a go at reaching them.

'I was gutted about my pies.'

Emma added: 'With our cooker, all you have to do is press the knob and turn it, and it comes on.

'She’s put her paw on it and turned it and has ignited it. I thought I was dreaming when I first smelled the smoke.'

The firefighters checked the house over and replaced a smoke alarm which had stopped working just two weeks before.

Adam and Emma now say they will remove the knobs from the cooker when it is not in use.
