The barristers' chambers led by Alex Cameron has announced it will back the strike against cuts on Monday morning

David Cameron’s elder brother has lent his backing to the lawyers’ strike designed to undermine the Government’s  legal aid reforms.

The barristers’ chambers led by Alex Cameron has indicated it will support the strike, in which the elite lawyers who work as trial advocates have said they will refuse to turn up to court on Monday morning.

Mr Cameron, a 50-year-old crime specialist reputed to be among the highest-earning barristers in the country, is a member of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA), the organisation behind next week’s strike.

A CBA spokesman said: ‘Alex Cameron’s chambers, Three Raymond Buildings, are supporting the CBA day of action. There isn’t a position from him personally.’

Mr Cameron has been head of Three Raymond Buildings since 2010 – billed in legal directories as ‘the chambers of Alexander Cameron QC’ – and so can be assumed to have been a leading voice in the chambers’ discussions about the dispute.

The strike has been arranged to demonstrate to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling the depth of feeling among barristers over the Coalition’s latest attempt to cut £200million from the £2.1billion annual cost of legal aid.

Yesterday, Mr Grayling’s civil servants published figures showing 1,200 barristers are paid more than £100,000 a year in public money for work in the criminal courts, and that 300 of them were paid more than £200,000 in fees from the taxpayer.

Mr Grayling proposes to cut legal aid 
fees for criminal barristers in everyday trials by around 10 per cent, 
and to chop as much as 30 per cent off the bills of barristers appearing
 in the longest-running and most expensive cases.

A spokesman for the chambers said though it was backing the action, the Prime Minister's brother had no 'personal position'

There will also be an attempt to cut the number of spurious cases brought by prisoners and funded by legal aid, an end to automatic legal aid for anybody with a disposable income higher than £37,500 a year, a squeeze on judicial review cases and a residency test to try to stop those without connections to the UK getting legal aid for civil cases.

Alex Cameron, who is three years older than the PM, went to the same prep school and to Eton, before studying law at Bristol University. He rose to the rank of QC at the age of 39.
