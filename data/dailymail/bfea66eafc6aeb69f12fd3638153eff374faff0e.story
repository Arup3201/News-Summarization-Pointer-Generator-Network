Over the past decade, we women have gone to great pains to avoid the cardinal sin of looking too ‘matchy-matchy’.

Confidently clashing colours and patterns, skilfully contrasting wool with leather — there is an art to stylishly mixing and layering clothes.

This season, forget all of that, as designers fill stores with perfectly matching separates: top-and-skirt sets and top-and-trouser combos. The head-to-toe effect is that of a layered dress, or a jumpsuit. Experts are calling it an update on the twinset.

And we’re not just talking about toning colours, co-ordinates, or smart suits; we’re talking former fashion no-nos, from double denim at Whistles (where the Hana utility trousers, £195, are teamed with a matching shirt for £145), to a monochrome set at LK Bennett (top, £165, trousers, £165), and a bright print top, £18, and trousers, £22, by Ax Paris at over-50s clothing website Isme.com.

This Jigsaw skirt and top is a more subtle and sophisticated take on the new twosie trend

Retailers are saying these ‘twosies’ will be this season’s biggest trend, following the recent success of onesies.

‘Matching separates are a really strong trend for autumn and winter,’ says top fashion stylist Catriona Stirling, who works with brands including Burberry, Marks & Spencer and Asos. ‘On the catwalks, at Celine and Kenzo especially, they looked very polished.’

Of course, what you immediately notice about these outfits is that the cost quickly adds up. The Isme set comes in at £40, whereas a jumpsuit from the same range is £30. Jigsaw has a subtly printed blue dress for £129, but the top and skirt come to £196 — though, in this case, the top, at least, is silk. And while a Hana jumpsuit from Whistles is £245, the top-and-trousers set costs £340.

Whether it’s catwalk or high street, the story is the same: Erdem’s beautiful brocade top and skirt come to £1,535, while a dress in a similar jacquard is £1,050.

So, is this the reason we’re being sold what is, after all, a Seventies throwback? Are retailers trying to get us to spend twice as much? Fashion experts insist it isn’t as calculated as that.

‘It’s not a conspiracy on the part of the fashion industry to try to get everyone to stop buying single pieces such as dresses,’ says Sandra Halliday, editor-in-chief of trends analyst Stylus Fashion.

‘often, as trend cycles go, you’ll have a dress period, and then a separates period — that’s just how it goes. And, don’t forget, even if you buy matching separates, you don’t have to wear them together.’

A range of twosies are already available from patterned tops to subtle skirt combos

Indeed, while retailers may benefit from multiple buys, the customer wins, too, in a number of ways.

First, of course, there is only one way to wear a dress or jumpsuit — while separates offer a multitude of options. Even a distinctive set, such as the floral cotton shell top, £59, and full skirt, £89, from Collection by John Lewis, together create a charmingly autumnal ensemble, but can easily be mixed and matched with other items of clothing.

Second, if you are one of the millions of women who find it difficult to shop for dresses and jumpsuits as you take different sizes on the upper and lower parts of your body, you can get the look more easily using separates.

Take Phase Eight’s Marcie shell top, £59, and A-line skirt, £69, which together look every bit the party dress. Simply match a pair of black, silk evening trousers with a top in the same fabric for an instant jumpsuit that fits perfectly.

‘Twiggy has designed a great black trousersuit with matching jewelled top for her M&S winter collection that would work perfectly for Christmas drinks parties — a great alternative to the classic cocktail dress,’ says Stirling.

‘This combination offers the consumer brilliant value for money, working as a total look, or by teaming the top with jeans and the trousers with a classic, white shirt.’

Perhaps the greatest strength of this trend, though, is that it so neatly straddles both formal and casual styles.

Reiss’s neoprene top, £79, and midi skirt, £89, are a perfect example. Individually, they are relaxed, sporty styles; but, together, and co-ordinated with a jacket and smart shoes, they look polished enough for the office.

With designers such as Michael Kors showing matching separates for Spring 2015 collections, it’s clearly not a trend that’s going anywhere any time soon.
