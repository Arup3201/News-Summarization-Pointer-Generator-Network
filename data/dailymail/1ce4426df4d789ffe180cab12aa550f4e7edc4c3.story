The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry were joined by world's fastest man Usain Bolt as they visited athletes competing in the Commonwealth Games on Tuesday.

The Royal trio and the Jamaican sprint star chatted and posed for photographs in the athletes' village in Glasgow as hundreds of people gathered to catch a glimpse of the visitors.

William, Kate and Harry also played ball games with school children after meeting some of the host nation's medal winners at Team Scotland's accommodation.

They were then given a tour of the recreation facilities for the athletes, where William played video games with some of the Welsh women's hockey team.

All three moved on to the village green where they heard a performance of the Games' anthem for Unicef from a group of local school children. They then joined in the ball games traditionally played in countries from across the Commonwealth.

Kate listened as one of the children explained the rules of a game which includes knocking down three tins with a ball before running in to the middle of the square, rebuilding them and hopping over the tins three times.

She cheered as she knocked the tins over and looked up and smiled after completing the task in her high wedges. The brothers later faced each other in opposing teams as they played the same game.

Earlier in the day, Kate had turned heads as she took her seat alongside William, Harry and track legend Sebastian Coe to watch the athletics in the city's Hampden Park stadium.

It came 
after a group of soldiers, who had assembled inside the famous stadium 
earlier in the day, could not help but turn their heads as Kate, dressed
 in a smart royal blue dress and dark blazer.

During
 the charity visit, brothers Harry and William had faced off on opposite
 sides of a five-a-side game, jostling each other jokingly. Harry's team
 was victorious with a 1-0 scoreline.

Goal
 scorer Lauren Weir, 21, from Glasgow, specialises in taekwondo and said
 it was only the second goal she had scored in her life.

She
 said: 'Prince Harry set me up for it and gave me a high 10. I said to 
Prince William 'hard lines, better luck next time' and he found that 
quite funny.'

Of the royals' footy skills, she added: 'They were saying they were rubbish but they're not too bad.'

Nathan Bawuah, 21, a judo coach who recently completed the programme in London, sparred with Prince Harry and drew 2-2.

He
 said: 'He was very nimble, which I didn't expect. He made me sweat so 
much. They were really down to earth which was really surprising.'

Friendly: It was Prince Harry's second day at the Games and he was pictured with the Australian and England women's hockey teams during a visit on Monday

Spotted: Prince William, who served in the Royal Air Force until last year, waved and spoke to soldiers as he and wife Kate entered the stadium to take their seats

Can't get enough: The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry returned to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow on Tuesday

Of his visit
 to the Games, he said: 'Glasgow is the friendliest place I've ever been
 - everywhere people are smiling and asking how you are. The atmosphere 
is second to none.'

Gillian
 Sloey, 20, a footballer from Glasgow who spoke with the Duke, said: 'He
 did say he is quite competitive. It was a pleasure meeting them and 
great to see them getting involved and having fun. They had smiles on 
their faces most of the way through.'Â 

At the end of the visit William and Harry joined all the young coaches for a group portrait.

The
 visits came the day after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince 
Harry toured the games, watching men's gymnastics and boxing and women's
 hockey and swimming.

Kate
 was spotted wincing as the royals watched English boxer Scott 
Fitzgerald and Azumah Mohammed of Ghana slugging it out in the ring.
