George Galloway has announced he is expecting a baby with his fourth wife, Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, who is 30 years his junior.

The Respect MP for Bradford West told his 170,000 followers on Twitter: ‘Gayatri and George Galloway are happy to announce they're expecting their first child, a sibling for Lucy Zein and Faris, God-willing.'

Mr Galloway, 59, married Miss Pertiwi, 29, an anthropologist, in a hotel in Amsterdam in April 2012, just four months after his third wife had given birth to their second son.

The ceremony happened just four months since his third wife had given birth to their second son.

His fourth wife is a Dutch-born researcher of Indonesian heritage who took a degree in cultural anthropology at the University of Utrecht.

She also studied in Amsterdam before taking a masters degree in children's rights at Amsterdam University.

Mr Galloway was expelled from the Labour Party in 2003 after accusations that he had called on foreign troops to attack British soldiers in Iraq.

He attracted widespread ridicule after he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother, when he went on all fours, purred and pretended to lick cream from actress Rula Lenska's hands.
