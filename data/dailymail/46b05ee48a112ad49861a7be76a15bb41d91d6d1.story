Helicopters, airplanes and firefighters have been struggling to contain wildfires that have killed 15 people, devastated more than 2,000 homes and left 8,000 homeless in Valparaiso, Chile.

A 15th body was found today and the toll of destroyed homes has risen to more than 2,150

As smoke rose from smoldering ruins all over the picturesque coastal city, many compared the scene to Dante's inferno.

Some people made their way home after days without sleep, only to discover ruins.

The
 fires, so hot they created their own fierce winds, consumed a few 
entire neighborhoods. In other districts, some houses stood unscathed 
but remained in danger from glowing embers carried by the shifting 
winds.

'We are looking at 
the largest air operation ever assembled against a fire like this,' 
Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said.

She said the blazes had grown to 'dimensions never before seen.'

Chile's
 forestry agency predicted it would take three weeks to completely stamp
 out the fires, which began Saturday in a forested ravine and quickly 
spread into ramshackle housing on one of Valparaiso's 42 hills.

People comfort each other after a fire devastated an area of Valparaiso, Chile. Hot ash rained down over wooden houses and narrow streets. Electricity failed as the fire grew, turning the night sky orange and reducing neighborhoods on six hilltops to ashes

Emergency responders struggled on Monday with outbreaks from a deadly blaze that tore through parts of an historic Chilean port city

Hot
 dry winds blowing out to sea whipped embers onto other neighborhoods on
 six densely populated hills where people live in poorly constructed 
homes without municipal water or sewer connections, fire hydrants or 
streets wide enough for emergency vehicles.

On Monday, there was no end in sight. Helicopters were flying without pause, dumping water on hotspots.

Aid
 was flowing in from all over Chile to Valparaiso, where evacuees 
crowded into eight shelters. Hundreds of young volunteers climbed hills 
carrying bottles of water and shovels to help victims search the ruins 
of their homes.

'We're 
going to rebuild right here. Where else would we go?' said Carolina 
Ovando, 22, who lost the humble home she kept with three small children.

Schools were closed, some of them damaged by fires and others jammed with evacuees.

Hotspot: Fires they thought were contained 24 hours after they started Saturday kicked up again with Sunday afternoon's winds and raged out of control, threatening more neighborhoods

Exhausted: Firefighters take a break as they struggled for a second night to contain blazes that have killed 15 people, injured 500, destroyed 2,000 homes and forced 10,000 people to flee

Dense housing: With no municipal water or fire hydrants to use, routes to the blazes blocked by narrow streets jammed with abandoned vehicles and countless embers being stoked, fire crews could do little but watch some neighborhoods burn

Picturesque: Valparaiso is a picturesque oceanside city of 250,000 people surrounded by hills that form a natural amphitheater

Powerless: From the sky, 20 helicopters and planes were mobilized to drop water on hotspots, but firefighters were still forced to stand by and watch as neighbourhoods burned out of control

House on fire: ost of the people live in the hills, and the city owes its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site to their colorful homes, built on slopes so steep that many people commute using staircases and cable cars

Danger: What's beautiful in postcards can be dangerous for those who live there: Many people have built on land not fit for housing, and entire communities lack municipal water connections

Navy
 officer Julio Leiva said Monday that the death toll rose to 15. Most of
 the bodies were too badly burned to identify without DNA tests, the 
national forensics service said. More than 500 people were treated at 
hospitals, mostly for smoke inhalation.

Bachelet
 coordinated the emergency response with her Cabinet, cancelling a trip 
to Argentina and Uruguay. She asked Chile's neighbors for backup in case
 of other fires, freeing Chilean planes and helicopters to join the 
fleet in Valparaiso.

Argentine
 Foreign Minister Hector Timerman promised to collaborate with rescue 
teams and water-dumping planes. From the Vatican, Pope Francis sent a 
message sharing his prayers.

Tragedy: Three of the 15 victims were identified, and the others are so badly burned that DNA tests will be done

Fire emergency: Chile's emergency response system generated automatic phone calls to each house in danger as the mandatory evacuations expanded

Blocked roads: Many people stuffed their cars with possessions after getting these calls, and streets quickly became impassible

Stuck downhill: Water trucks and firefighters were stuck downhill as people abandoned their vehicles and ran. Some carried television sets and others took canisters of natural gas, fearing an explosion if flames reached their homes

Heightened security: Some 1,250 firefighters, police and forest rangers battled the blaze while 2,000 sailors in combat gear patrolled streets to maintain order and prevent looting

Bachelet
 put the entire city under military rule, and 5,000 firefighters, 
police, forest rangers, soldiers, sailors and civil defense workers 
joined the response. Cars were banned from streets leading up eight of 
the Valparaiso's hills so emergency vehicles could get through.

Valparaiso is an oceanside city of 250,000 people surrounded by hills that form a natural amphitheater.

The
 compact downtown includes Chile's congress and its second-largest port,
 and the city owes its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site to the 
colorful homes built on slopes so steep that many people commute using 
stairs and cable cars.

But
 what's beautiful on postcards can be dangerous for those who live 
there: Many people have built on land not fit for housing.

'We
 are too vulnerable as a city. We have been the builders and architects 
of our own danger,'Valparaiso Mayor Jorge Castro said Sunday in an 
interview with Chile's 24H channel.
