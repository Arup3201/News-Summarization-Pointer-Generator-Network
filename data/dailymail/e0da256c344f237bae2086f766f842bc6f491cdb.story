No show: Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson did not show up for court proceedings in the drug bust that earned him a police medal on Monday

The drug bust that earned Darren Wilson a police commendation may be thrown out since the officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown has been unable to testify while in hiding.

When Wilson didn't show up in court on Monday, a judge approved the request by county prosecutors Monday to postpone the case of 28-year-old Christopher Brooks, who was arrested by Wilson in February 2013 on drug charges.

Brooks' attorney wants the marijuana distribution charge dismissed because he doesn't expect Wilson to show up in court to testify.

'Wilson is compromised as a witness,' said defense attorney Nick Zotos, who opposed the request by Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch's office to shift the drug case to a panel that meets behind closed doors.

The case is now going to a grand jury, but Zotos says he has talked with Wilson's attorneys who allegedly say he wouldn't attend either a preliminary hearing or grand jury hearing on the matter. 

Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch, told St Louis Today that Brook's case could not go to trial without Wilson as a witness.

Wilson, 28, received a Ferguson City Council commendation for his role in Christopher Brooks' arrest. 

But Zotos said Brooks was 'roughed up' by Wilson after he refused to hand over the keys to a locked car parked in his grandmother's driveway, where Ferguson police say they found drug paraphernalia and several ounces of marijuana. 

Zotos also questioned whether Wilson's actions merited special recognition by the city.

'We give trophies every day for just showing up,' he said after the brief hearing. 'If you play on the team, you get a trophy.'

Up in the air: Wilson has been identified as the police officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown (left) earlier this summer. He was previously awarded a police commendation for arresting 28-year-old Christopher Brooks (pictured on Monday, right) in February 2013 on drug charges. Brooks' case remains in limbo while Wilson is unable to testify from hiding

And Zotos believes the case could be thrown out since Wilson was the main officer who made the arrest, with other officers only responding later and therefore ineffective witnesses for a court case.  

Brooks was pictured outside of court on Monday but he gave no comment. However he has spoken out on Facebook about the possibility the case may be dropped. 

Brooks has also claimed that Wilson 'beat my a** in my front yard while I was handcuffed then gave me 6 felonies.'

The same grand jury also is reviewing evidence in the early August death of Michael Brown to determine whether Wilson should face criminal charges in a shooting that led to violent protests, hundreds of arrests, the summoning of the Missouri National Guard for security and international attention. 

McCulloch has said he expects the grand jury to complete its work on the Brown shooting by mid-October or early November, though its term has been extended until January.

The assistant prosecutor, who did not publicly identify himself in court, did not indicate during Brooks' hearing why the county wants to shift the case to the grand jury. 

A McCulloch spokesman said later that he was not familiar with the case.
