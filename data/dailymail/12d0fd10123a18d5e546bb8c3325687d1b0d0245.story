Father's day has been spent recovering in hospital for rocker Jimmy Barnes following emergency back surgery.

But it hasn't been all misery for the Australian music icon, who has been celebrating, just a little more low key, his new album 30:30 Hindsight, debuting at number one on the ARIA charts.

Barnes has been advised by doctors to rest up for the next week after he is released from hospital.

On his facebook page on Sunday he said 'unfortunately I've had to pull out of tomorrows Q and A on ABC as per the doctors orders.' 

He told News.com.au he was very lucky to have a great surgeon and as much as he didn't want to take their advice to stay in bed, he will, meanwhile admitting he can't wait to be up and about.

But despite being in hospital for fathers day, Sunday, Barnes had plenty of visitors to keep him occupied, including TV host and singer David Campbell.

He was never going to miss a catch up with his dad, posting a family shot, visiting Barnes in hospital.

'He is in top form. Will be back rocking soon. Here is a couple of generations celebrating father's day,' he said.

Campbell also tweeted, 'on Father's Day everyone thinks their Dad is Number 1. Mine literally is. Love you @JimmyBarnes Congrats on your 10th solo ARIA number 1.'

His daughter Mahalia also wished her dad a happy father's day on twitter saying, 'happy Father's Day to the most amazing dad. I love you more than anything. I adore you.'

His wife Jane also came to visit him in hospital, posting a picture of him resting up with a book.

News.com.au also reported his record label boss and mate Michael Gudinski joked that the rocker had got 'over excited about his No.1'.

'I think he was more excited about this one than he was for the first one he got,' he said.

The much loved rocker also took to social media to say thanks to all his fans.

'Thank you so much for all your support. There are simply no words to explain how grateful I am to have you all as fans.'

'It's an extra special year now as I've reached my 10th number one in my 30th year as a solo artist,' he said.

The much-loved rocker confirms his position as one of the country’s most successful recording artists with his 10th No. 1 solo record. He can add it to the tally, with four top spots he shared with Cold Chisel

'Thank you to everyone who has helped me through my career over the years, you're all part of this commemorative record.' 

Barnes also had a run of top spots that he shared with iconic Aussie band Cold Chisel, with nine albums making the Australian top ten. He recorded 14 Top 40 Albums for Cold Chisel and 13 charting solo albums in Australia.

30:30 Hindsight is a collaboration of Barnes with members of his family, recreating some of his classic and much loved hits.

He also got a bit of help from country pop star Keith Urban who helped Barnes reinvent Good Times, the Easybeats song he made a hit with INXS in the 1980s.

But there's also a long list of other famous artists featuring on his album including Tina Arena and Diesel.

The first single released from the anniversary album is 'Lay Down Your Guns' featuring The Living End, the original version of which hit number one in 1990. 

And with his album success there was some good news for his loyal fans, who can catch their favourite singer when he tours around Australia from next month.

In addition to his already announced A Day On The Green shows and special guest slot with the Rolling Stones in Adelaide, Jimmy Barnes will be travelling from Canberra, to Warragul, to Port Pirie and a whole bunch of towns in between.
