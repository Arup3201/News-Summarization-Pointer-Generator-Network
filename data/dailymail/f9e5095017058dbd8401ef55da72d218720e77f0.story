The MTA guard told the man the station was not open, sparking an altercation, sources said

An armed subway guard shot a man wielding a screwdriver who was trying to force his way into a closed station.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority agent was forced to open fire on an apparently homeless man who tried to barge into a shuttered station in Brooklyn early Wednesday, authorities told the New York Daily News.

The revenue collection agent shot the man, who was wielding a screwdriver, once in the chest during a confrontation at about 2am.

A law enforcement source said the agent was standing at the station entrance when the man tried to enter.

The agent told him the station was closed and a dispute erupted, the source said.

The homeless man 'lunged' at the agent, according to Derrick Echevarria, a divisional chairman with Transport Workers Union Local 100.

'He tried to avoid him,' Echevarria said. 'He tried to walk away, but he kept following him.'

The wounded man was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he was in a stable condition, the law enforcement source said.

The agent thought the screwdriver was a knife, said Maurice Jenkins, a Local 100 vice president. He positioned himself behind a pole and tried to keep a safe distance from the man, but the intruder kept coming, Jenkins said.

'The agent showed extreme 
restraint,but it became life or death,' Jenkins said. 'He tried 
everything he could to get away from him.'

The agent went to the closed station with a maintenance worker to inspect and check MetroCard vending machines and equipment in the token booth, Jenkins said.

Even though the system is closed, transit workers are tasked with keeping stations ready for the eventual return of riders.

Jenkins said the revenue collection agent has been on the job for 26 years and never before fired his weapon. He was interviewed by police but not charged.
