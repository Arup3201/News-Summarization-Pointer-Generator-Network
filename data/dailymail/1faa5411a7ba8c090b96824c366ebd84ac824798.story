They’ve handled every kind of horsepower – from race horses to revved engines.

A gas station in Queens, New York has remarkably been open for 145 years and has changed throughout the centuries from a blacksmith shop to an auto body shop, and is now run by the founder’s great-great grandson.

John Farrington, 56, co-owns Farrington Service Station with his brother Michael and said it has been a pleasure to be an institution in the neighborhood for nearly a century and a half.

Speaking with MailOnline from his home in College Point, Mr Farrington was bursting with pride to speak of the family business, which was established only three years after the end of the American Civil War.

‘The gas station was started by my great-great grandfather William Farrington, but my great-grandfather John Farrington stands out the most,’ he said, adding that it was his great-grandfather who is in the majority of pictures that line the shop’s interior.

The business started out as a blacksmith where Farrington would create specialized racing horseshoes and fit them to the horses’ hooves. The owner was also an avid racer himself, and owned several horses.

The first John Farrington was born in 1873, and took over the family trade around the turn of the 20th century. It was this Farrington who saw the surge in popularity with the new-fangled ‘horseless carriages,’ which, of course, evolved into the modern-day motorcar. 

The service station, as it exists now, is not the original building, Mr Farrington said. ‘We think from the things we’ve seen on the records that around 1917 to 1920, they converted to a gas station, because cars started taking over in the area.’

When MailOnline visited the site, Mr Farrington was not at the shop, which was staffed by brothers Doug and Fred Otto, who have worked at the station for the last 30 years, Fred as Farrington's Service Station Manager and Doug as a pump attendant.

He said they ripped down the old blacksmith shop to build the new gas station. A second building was constructed next door during the Great Depression to house more vehicles.

Mr Farrington said that his luck has everything to do with the common sense that previous generations taught him. ‘We’ve gone from horses to gas stations, we’ve gone through depressions and recessions. We believe in putting (money) away in good times and saving it for the bad times.’

He continued: ‘My grandfather used to always say, you always gotta run scared, because it’s when you don’t worry about something that you forget about the lean times.

'They came through the Depression, and they never forgot those kinds of things. If we ever had money for business, my grandfather would always pay it off twice as fast.’

The Farringtons have a history in New York spanning several centuries – before the U.S. had even been formed. Mr Farrington said that 10 generations back, a Farrington served as Magistrate for the area that is now College Point.

Growing up in the working middle-class neighborhood, Mr Farrington remembered spending his childhood alongside his brother at the gas station while their father, George, ran the business.

'My grandfather always said never sell your luck, so we have no intentions of getting rid of the station.'

‘It was nice,’ he said. ‘In the 60s, when they had the Hot Rods and the racing cars, and everybody came in with their fancy Nomads, the GTOs. They used to come into the gas station – we loved that because we’d go for rides.’

The gas station, he explained, became a popular hang-out spot, where car owners could get a tune-up, a check-up, or even $2 worth of gas, which in the day, went a lot farther.

‘When I was really young, gas prices were all over the place. I remember at one time 35 cents a gallon, probably in the late 60s. I remember going out as a kid, asking for $2 of gas. The pumps then were so slow, you felt like you were standing there forever,’ he said.

Their father passed away this Valentine’s Day at the age of 83. The son said that he is running the family business to pay homage to him. 

The station has also been through several providers, beginning with Sinclair, moving on to BP, and finally settling on Gulf.

He told the New York Post that things began getting tough in the past few years, with skyrocketing delivery costs through Gulf that threatened to put the family-owned business in the red.

But Mr Farrington found a friend who sells him gas directly, allowing him to sell his 70,000 or 80,000 gallons per month at 10 to 15 cents lower than any of his competitors.

‘It’s been beneficial for us to work together,’ Mr Farrington said. ‘Gasoline doesn’t make you a lot of money today, but we did it for our customer’s sake,’ he said, adding that generations of College Point residents look to the family business as a neighborhood institution.

He said he doesn't know of any other gas station in the city with such a long and unique history.

As far as the future is concerned, Mr Farrington said he’s waiting to see what happens with hybrid and electric cars. 

‘It’s too vague right now for the future, but we own the property. If everything changes and we start landing helicopters, or if it’s like the Jetsons with flying cars whizzing down the street, we’ll adapt to it,’ he said, noting that his family has been malleable to the changing times. 

‘My grandfather always said never sell your luck, so we have no intentions of getting rid of it.’
