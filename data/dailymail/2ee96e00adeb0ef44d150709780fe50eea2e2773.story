When Mame Biram Diouf received the ball midway inside his own half, even he could not have dreamt how it would end.

David Silva’s corner had been headed clear by Marc Wilson after 58 minutes and the big Senegal striker was under pressure from Aleksandar Kolarov. Diouf turned the Serbian and set off optimistically towards the Manchester City goal with very little support from his team-mates.

Substitute Fernandinho positioned himself in Diouf’s path, hoping no doubt to hinder his progress, but he was left looking rather foolish as the former Manchester United striker simply accelerated past the stationary Brazilian.

Still, it appeared as though he had taken the ball too wide of goal as Kolarov raced back to block the shot, but suddenly the ball was flying off his right boot and through the legs of goalkeeper Joe Hart.

It was Diouf’s first goal since joining Stoke City this summer, and a wonderful one at that.

City were stunned. Stoke could hardly believe it themselves, and with good reason.

To appreciate the magnitude of this result, you have only to consider the statistics. Stoke had lost on all six of their previous Premier League visits to the Etihad, failing to score so much as a single goal. The aggregate score was 15-0.

City, on the other hand, only lost once here in the league throughout last season and that was to Chelsea. The two defeats mark the only occasions on which they have failed to score in 71 home league games.

The champions will claim that they should have had one, possibly two, penalties in the second half after the ball ricocheted off Phil Bardsley and struck Wilson on the hand from close range before Yaya Toure was brought down by Erik Pieters towards the end.

‘All of you know that it was a clear penalty,’ said City manager Manuel Pellegrini of the second incident.

However, Stoke had a decent appeal of their own turned down by referee Lee Mason in the first half when Diouf tangled with Kolarov and then went down under the defender’s untidy challenge.

‘People are saying that theirs was a good call for a penalty but I saw the one that we should have had in the first half,’ said Stoke manager Mark Hughes.

The Welshman has not enjoyed the happiest of returns to the Etihad since he was unceremoniously sacked in 2009. The best of it was a point with Fulham. Even beating relegation with QPR was tainted by having to see his successor, Roberto Mancini, snatch the title on the last day of the season.

Pellegrini managed it in his first season in England but the Chilean will be concerned at his team’s lethargy at times on Saturday. They lacked the cutting edge that saw off Liverpool so convincingly last Monday, creating only a handful of chances that fell to the wasteful Toure.

Despite the attacking options available to him, Pellegrini acknowledged that he now has 48 hours before the transfer window closes to add to his squad.

Whether that involves AS Monaco striker Radamel Falcao remains to be seen.

But City were held at bay too easily here by a Stoke side with two stubborn banks of four and a typically tenacious attitude aimed at knocking their opponents out of their stride. The game was only a few minutes old when Sergio Aguero went down and stayed there after colliding with Ryan Shawcross as he spun past the Stoke skipper.

Bardsley was booked for going through the back of Silva who then clashed with Shawcross and was more than happy to see Stevan Jovetic go into battle with the big defender on his behalf.

City also lost Fernando before half-time when their new £14million signing limped off with a groin injury following a challenge with Glenn Whelan.

Their best chance arrived in stoppage time at the end of the half when Aguero twisted and turned around the penalty box before releasing Kolarov on the overlap. The Serbian’s low cross picked out Toure who met it with a first-time effort with his left foot that clipped Asmir Begovic’s bar.

Toure had two more good chances in the second half, one of which brought the reflex save from Begovic, and one that led indirectly to Stoke’s winning goal on the counter attack.

They had to do more than their fair share of defending to keep the lead and it wasn’t particularly pretty.

But Hughes is slowly introducing the passing game that persuaded his employers to choose him as Tony Pulis’s replacement, and at times they looked almost comfortable against the Premier League Champions.

‘We’re Stoke City, we’re passing the ball,’ sang their supporters as the Potters played their way out of trouble in the dying minutes.

Back at the Etihad and on the brink of victory, it was music to Hughes’s ears.
