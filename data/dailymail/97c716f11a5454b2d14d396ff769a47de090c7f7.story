The U.S. Capitol building went dark and thousands of homes lost power Wednesday night after strong winds caused power outages in Washington D.C. and other areas of Maryland and Virginia.

Winds traveling at up to 61 miles per hour blew into the capital and temperatures plummeted from a high of 69 degrees to 21 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.

The lights inside the Capitol remained on, but the exterior lighting illuminating the dome went out for about half an hour just after 8:30pm.

According to authorities, the racing winds tripped the breakers, causing the power surge that knocked out the lights.

The iconic building's dome shrouded in darkness was a strange sight, and many posted photographs of the darkened building to social media.

The outage prompted a flood of comments on Twitter, with jokes about government efficiency being chief among them.

An architect of the Capitol employee who was inside the building after the lights went out said that such an occurrence is very rare.

He could not recall the last time the building experienced a power outage but told the National Journal it was 'a long time ago.'

Power was restored to the building within about half an hour.

Raging winds pummeled other parts of Maryland and Virginia, knocking out power to other iconic Washington landmarks and 50,000 homes.

The National Weather Service issued a Red Flag Warning for the enhanced potential of fire spread today, and although the advisory ended at 11am, high winds are expected to continue until the evening.

Several thousand homes were still without power on Thursday morning.
