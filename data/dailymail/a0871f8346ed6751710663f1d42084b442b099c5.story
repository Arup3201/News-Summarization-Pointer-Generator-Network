To play darts at the Sixpenny Pint you have to throw from outside the front door, but there's no room for such games here, where beer is taken seriously and space is at a premium.

The humble little watering hole, at 68 square feet, is one of the smallest in the country and can be found in deepest Dorset between Salisbury and Blandford Forum.

It has been named in the Good Beer Guide for the third consecutive year, not bad for its five-year history after it opened as an offshoot of the Sixpenny Brewery.

Pint-sized: The Sixpenny Pint in Dorset can fit no more than 17 people inside at any one time

Patience required: The pub, despite its size, has been named in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide for the third year

The farm's former milking parlour, the Tap can fit just 17 people inside with a single bar tender manning the eight foot-wide bar.

While it is open year-round, the Sixpenny Tap does its best business in the warmer months when locals and visitors can spill into the outside area.

Up to 80 drinkers can be found at the pub at one time, a stretch for the sole staff member, but they have a fine solution for that too - a communal self-service tap away from the bar for those unwilling to wait to be served, with an honesty box system for payment. 

Kevin Patrick, who helps run the piddly pub under Brewery owner and landlord Scott Wayland, said the eight foot-square room was initially set up as a tasting room.

'After the brewery was set up in 2009 we converted a tiny eight-foot square corner of the old milking parlour into a little room for sampling our beers but it quickly became popular with locals and visitors further afield,' Patrick said.

'People started coming to the tasting room to enjoy a few pints and within just a few months it had transformed into a micropub in its own right.

'Like all great pubs it has a friendly, welcoming atmosphere and sublime beers on tap but we just can't fit any more than 17 people inside.

'The pub is only 68 square feet which makes us one of the smallest pubs in the world and probably the smallest in Britain.'

Spilling over: When the inside of the pub is jammed, or if it's a nice day, up to 80 people fit into the outside area

A number of establishments would dispute that claim. 

The Guinness Book of World Records says the smallest pub in Britain is The Nutshell in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, which is in fact bigger at 105 square feet but can barely fit 10 people inside at any one time.

The Signal Box Inn in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, is 64 square feet and lays claim to being the 'smallest pub on the planet'. 

But it is merely a seasonal bar attached to a heritage steam railway rather than a 12 months-a-year operation with regular opening hours like the tap.

Farm watering hole: The pub, opened in 2009 along with the Sixpenny Brewery, is on a former dairy farm

There's no inferiority complex for the Tap when it comes to size though.

Patrick adds: 'Being so small works in our favour because it creates an electric atmosphere.

'We have just been listed by CAMRA's Good Beer Guide which is testament to the quality of the beer and the popularity of the pub.

'We have the sort of atmosphere and clientele that many a local pub would die for.'
