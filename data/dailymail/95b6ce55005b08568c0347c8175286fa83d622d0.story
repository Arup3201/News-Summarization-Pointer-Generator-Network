Manchester United new boy Marcos Rojo will not be allowed to make his debut against MK Dons on Tuesday night as issues with securing a work permit continue.

Louis van Gaal had hoped Rojo would be available to take part in United's 1-1 draw with Sunderland on Sunday, but will now target the away game against Burnley on Saturday.

The 24-year-old defender completed his £16million deal to United last week but will have to wait until his work permit is given the green light.

Rojo adds to the long list of absentees for the week ahead as Luke Shaw, Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini, Jesse Lingard, Rafael da Silva and Ander Herrera all out injured.

Van Gaal looks set to continue giving his young players a chance on Tuesday with the likes of Michael Keane and Tyler Blackett in the starting line-up.
