Nearly 200 patients due to undergo surgery at a brand-new flagship PFI hospital have had their operations cancelled before it even opens its doors.

Problems with the air conditioning at the new Southmead Hospital in Bristol mean it will be a month until regular operations can take place there.

North Bristol NHS said adjustments needed to be made to a 'high-tech air flow system' which helps to eliminate infection risks.

Teething problems: Nearly 200 operations at the £430million, PFI-financed Southmead Hospital, Bristol,  ave been postponed after managers admitted problems with the 'high-tech air flow system'

The new hospital was funded by £430million of private cash. It is costing taxpayers £37million a year in repayments and site maintenance under a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract.

A spokesman has claimed that patients were being transferred to the new hospital according to a phased process, that fewer operations were expected, and that emergency surgery was unaffected.

But despite the claims that everything was proceeding more or less according to plan, there have been anecdotal reports that the surgical schedule at Southmead is in fact in disarray.

one patient told the Bristol Post that she had arrived for a spinal operation appointment at 7am earlier this week and was left to wait on a bed in a corridor until 11am.

Only then was she told that the operating theatres were not ready and she finally was sent home at 1.30pm. She claimed that parts of the building where she was waiting looked unfinished, with wires hanging from the ceilings and builders still tidying up.

North Bristol NHS admitted it had put back 180 operations.

Medical director Chris Burton said: 'We only reschedule operations when it is absolutely necessary and apologise to any patients who have been affected.

'Anyone who has been affected has been personally contacted to inform them of the changes to their operation.

'There was always going to be a phased process in opening the new theatres and fewer planned operations were scheduled for this period.

'We have continued to use operating theatres in the old Southmead and Frenchay Hospitals as the move has taken place to minimise the impact whilst getting the new theatres open.'

He added: 'Technical adjustments needed to be made to the high-tech air flow system in the theatres, which have been incorporated to eliminate infection risks now and in the future.'

The new 'super hospital' is supposed to bring services from Frenchay and Southmead hospitals together on one site for the first time.

Touted by Lloyds Bank as a 'showcase development', it combines more than 800 acute beds and 24 operating theatres with a new accident and emergency department over a 24.8-hectare site.

Carillion handed North Bristol NHS the keys to the new building in March and it had been expected to be fully open to patients by this coming Wednesday.

A spokesman would not comment on claims that building work was unfinished. Mr Burton insisted that urgent surgery was still being carried out in the new building as needed.

'We expect the remaining theatres to be open for planned surgery next week,' he told the Bristol Post.

Last week there were tears as nurses patched up the sick and injured for the last time in the Accident and Emergency department at Frenchay Hospital before moving to Southmead.

Farewell: Nurses and other staff released balloons outside Frenchay Hospital A&E in Bristol to mark its closure

Final night: The hospital closed early Monday morning after 50 years of treating emergency patients

Tears: Emotional nurses gathered in the ward after their final night shift on Monday

Many of the men and women who had worked in the hospital - some for almost 40 years - wept as they bade farewell to the A&E department, which is being moved to a more modern building.

Hospital workers launched balloons and left farewell messages as their final night shift ended in the early hours of last Monday morning.

The casualty department - which opened in the 1960s - was designed to cope with around 35,000 people a year, but in recently years had been dealing with as many as 100,000 annual patients.
