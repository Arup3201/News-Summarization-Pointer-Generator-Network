Offenders ordered to do unpaid work rather than go to prison see it as an easy option, and many don't even bother to turn up for all of it, new research shows.

A Ministry of Justice report found that 82 per cent of offenders saw community service orders, which covered menials tasks such as clearing local parks, cleaning graffiti, or cleaning the streets, as less harsh than going to prison.

Despite this, nearly three-quarters (70 per cent) of those given unpaid work missed at least a day of it, and 14 per cent said they had missed most of it.

And their failure to attend largely went unpenalised: court action was taken in less than half the number of cases of those who failed to attend their unpaid work.

And only 21 per cent of offenders questioned for the Ministry of Justice survey, which questioned offenders over 18 who were given community orders, said the fear of getting another community order would stop them reoffending in future.

The research found that 77 per cent of offenders who had been to prison before thought that prison would have been a worse punishment than a community order, while 87 per cent of offenders who had not been to prison felt that way.

Today, a think-tank said community punishments should be harsher to ensure they did deter would-be criminals and change behaviour.

Max Chambers from the Policy Exchange said: 'Unpaid work requirements must be far more demanding and intensive if they are to deter criminals and command public confidence.

'We need a competent probation system that actually changes behaviour. 

'The best way to do that is to reform the system so that there is a rigorous focus on compliance and a serious effort to punish infractions in a rapid and consistent way.'

But Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said community sentences were being 'toughened up'.

He said: 'Hard-working taxpayers expect those convicted of committing crime to be punished accordingly.

'Victims must be confident that offenders will pay a price for their crimes, which is why we have toughened up community sentences to now include a punitive element in all adult community sentences.

'Since 2010 criminals are also more likely to go to prison, and for longer.

'Step by step we're overhauling sentencing and sending a clear message to criminals - if you break the law, you will be punished.'
