Inquest: Declan Gatenby, 13, who was found hanged at home after he had his mobile phone confiscated

A 13-year-old boy hanged himself in his bedroom after his mobile was confiscated by his parents - but he may not have meant to kill himself, an inquest heard.

Declan Gatenby had been told to hand over his phone, described as being usually 'glued to his hand', after he had got into trouble at school.

But on the day before it was to be given back he became upset when his father refused to relent.

He ran up to his bedroom and was later found hanged by his nine-year-old brother Jordan.

The coroner at his inquest said he believed the teenager had hoped his younger brother or father would follow him and find him in time.

Declan, from Rossendale, Lancashire, was a 'typical teenager' who was described as 'cheeky and mischievous,' his parents said.

In a statement his 31-year old father Wayne Gatenby told the hearing in Burnley: 'He was a typical teenage lad. He pushed the boundaries as may be expected and got into trouble at school on a few occasions - but nothing terribly serious.

'We had no problems with him, nothing gave us huge cause for concern.'

But the inquest was told Mr Gatenby and Declan's mother Donna, 32, decided to ground their son and his mobile phone was taken away from him for a week.

In the day before his death he was allowed to go out and see his grandmother who lived close by, before watching films with his younger brother Jordan, nine.

On the day of the tragedy on July 7, Donna left for work as a kitchen assistant at a care home at 11.30am and Warren was at home with the two boys.

He said: 'It was a hot day and they were in and out of the house, they came in and out, watched TV with me and went out again. At 5.30pm Declan asked if he could have his phone back.'

The Burnley inquest heard Mr Gatenby told his son it wasn't due back until later and he said Declan 'wasn't happy about it' and got up and left the room.

He added: ''He was due to get it back on the Monday, the day after. He got up and left the room.

'I heard the front door to the house open and close and presumed he had simply gone out. I thought he accepted it and made his way outside.'

Grief: Outgoing Declan's death shocked his family and friends and led to graffiti tributes like this one

Jordan later went to the room he shared with Declan to find the body of his brother. Mr Gatenby alerted by his youngest son ran upstairs and tried to revive his eldest son but in vain.

Ambulance staff arrived minutes later but could not save him.

Mr Gatenby told the inquest the family had not been aware of any problems within his school life and inquires that were made showed that there had been nothing significant to note.

He added: 'There was nothing days or hours beforehand that made me think for even one minute that anything was wrong. I still find it so difficult to believe. There were no signs he was depressed or wanting to hurt himself in any way.'

Recording a verdict of misadventure, the coroner Richard Taylor told the family: 'I'm sorry you have had to relive this today but we have to do it to make it as straightforward for you without ignoring the importance of an inquest.

'I cannot imagine what you have had to go through over these last few months, my sympathies are with you all. Whether Declan deliberately took his own life I cannot come to that conclusion for a number of reasons.

'Whilst he has done a deliberate act, I would have to conclude that his intention was to end his life by doing that, and that is a step too far.

'I cannot believe that is what he wanted to do, a happy-go-lucky teenager showing no signs of him ever considering something like this.

'I feel the appropriate conclusion I should draw is one of misadventure. It is the unexpected outcome of a deliberate action, yes he has done something, but I do not believe for one moment that he actually intended to end his life.

'This is why I asked the question about the front door being open and shut, he may have expected someone to come upstairs after him.'

Declan's family were too upset to comment after the hearing, At the time of the tragedy they told how he would enjoy fishing, magic tricks, BMX biking and skateboarding and had been about to try out for the athletics team at school.

In the weeks before the tragedy the family had just returned from a holiday in Menorca where Declan had learned to swim.

In an interview at the time of his death Mr Gatenby said: 'When he was at home he was quite outgoing, but when he was out and about he was a bit shy really. He was always playing games on his mobile, you'd think it was glued to his hand.'

Declan's grandmother Lynn Love said: 'He was very loving, there are no words to describe how much he will be missed. I didn't realise how many people knew him. Lots of people have passed on their sympathies, he had a bit of mischief to him.

'You only had to look at that face to wonder what he had been up to.'
