Voters in the tiny Spanish village of Castrillo Matajudios, whose name means "Camp Kill Jews," overwhelmingly decided Sunday that it's time to change the name their town has had for nearly four centuries.

Mayor Lorenzo Rodriguez said the vote was 29-19 in heavy turnout for the village with just 56 registered voters about 160 miles north of Madrid.

Documents show the town's original name was Castrillo Motajudios, meaning 'Jews' Hill Camp.'

The 'Kill Jews' part of the name dates from 1627, more than a century after a 1492 Spanish royal edict ordering Jews to become Catholics or flee the country. Those who remained faced the Spanish inquisition, with many burned at the stake.

Although Jews were killed in the area, researchers believe the town got its current name from Jewish residents who converted to Catholicism and wanted to reinforce their repudiation of Judaism to convince Spanish authorities of their loyalty, Rodriguez said.

Others suspect the change may have come from a slip of the pen.

Castrillo Matajudios wants to attract more tourists and townsfolk thought highlighting its Jewish past could help. Some residents are also embarrassed by the name.

Although no Jews live in the town today, Rodriguez said many residents have ancient Jewish roots and the town's official shield includes the Star of David.

Spain's government earlier this year apologized to Jews by offering citizenship to descendants of those who were forced to flee centuries ago.

Most voters who wanted a change want to revive the 'Jews' Hill Camp' name but a final decision won't happen until a town hall meeting is held in June.

In Leon, Spain, ‘kill Jews’ (mata 
judios) is a slang term which refers to the drinking of lemonade which 
has been spiked with alcohol.

There
 are several theories as to when the term was coined although it almost 
certainly came from medieval times, when converted Jews would sometimes 
be publicly executed in show trials around Easter.

Some theories suggest it was born out of the relationship in the area between Christian residents and Jewish residents.

It
 is one belief that the term was related to the charge of Jewish deicide
 which suggested that Jewish people as a whole were responsible for the 
death of Jesus Christ.

Castrillo
 de Matajudíos’ town mayor, Lorenzo Rodriguez, said the town was given 
its name following the Spanish Inquisition began in 1478.

Today,
 the legacy of the Spanish Inquisition lives on in the country with the 
terms ‘matar judíos’ and ‘matajudíos,’ both used in reference to the 
inquisition.

The term, which means ‘kill Jews’, also appears in colloquial language and place names, as well as some family names.

It
 is more commonly used by locals in reference to 'drinking lemonade', 
especially over the Easter period when residents populate city centre 
squares to drink lemonade spiked with alcohol as part of annual festival
 celebrations.
