Iker Casillas has warned that Real Madrid are back on top form after a difficult start to their La Liga season.

Los Blancos lost two of their first three matches, to Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid, but have since gone on a four-match winning streak to return to the upper echelons of the league.

Carlo Ancelotti's men have scored 20 goals in just four matches on their charge up the division, and Casillas believes that things have changed at the Bernabeu.

'The results could have gone differently but we were good across the park. We still have to catch up with the league leaders,' the experienced goalkeeper told FourFourTwo.

'We had been conceding a lot of goals so this is an important result. The team was full of confidence and we were solid throughout. We players at the back feel the support from the forward players.'

Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema secured the points against Athletic Bilbao at the weekend, with the former scoring a hat-trick - his 13th goal of the season after just seven games.
