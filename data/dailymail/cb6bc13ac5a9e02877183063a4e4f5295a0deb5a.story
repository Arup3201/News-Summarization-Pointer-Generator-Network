As a heavyweight boxer, Dereck Chisora is used to working hard.

But even he seemed to be struggling as he got to grips with his community service this week.

Chisora was spotted in north London hauling heavy bin bags and shovelling dirt after he threatened to kill a man in a car park last year.

Dereck Chisora shovels dirt as he does community service in north London this week

The 31-year-old has not fought since losing to British rival Tyson Fury last November.

A week later, he lost his temper with a man whose friend blocked his Mercedes while they visited the Post Office.

Chisora swore at driver Mansor Nikpor and threatened to kill his passenger Majid Rezaemi.

The two men left a note on their car with a mobile number if anyone wanted them to move their car while they were at the post office.

Chisora was ordered to complete 60 hours of community service after threatening to kill a man

Chisora shouted at them as they walked away and again on their return. Mr Rezaemi threatened to phone the police but Chisora responded by saying: ‘I’m late for my appointment. I’ll kill you.’

The former European champion was ordered to pay each victim £100 and complete 60 hours of community service after he admitted threatening behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke unlawful violence towards the pair.

Chisora's last fight was a convincing defeat to British rival Tyson Fury in their heavyweight rematch
