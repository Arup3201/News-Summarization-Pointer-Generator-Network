Ambushed: David Cameron in white tie last night

David Cameron and Theresa May narrowly avoided humiliation over the European Arrest Warrant last night amid scenes of chaos, confusion and recrimination in the Commons.

Speaker John Bercow prompted uproar as he attacked the Government for denying MPs a specific vote on the controversial measure – with Eurosceptic Tories accusing their leadership of ‘tyranny’, ‘deception’ and ‘chicanery’.

In extraordinary remarks for a Speaker, Mr Bercow accused ministers of breaking their promises for a full debate and vote on the warrant in a ‘sorry saga’ that would leave the public ‘contemptuous’.

Mr Cameron came within nine votes of losing the support of the Commons after Labour mounted an ambush to try to halt proceedings.

But after the attempt was narrowly outvoted, the Government went on to win a separate, key vote on a package of EU crime and justice measures by a large margin, by 464 to 38.

Despite trying to derail proceedings, Labour backed the Government when it came to the substance of the issue – ensuring a large majority.

However, the earlier manoeuvre meant the Prime Minister was forced to rush back from his annual speech at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet in London – dressed in the traditional white tie worn at the occasion – to take part in the vote.

The victory came at a high price, with Eurosceptic Tories bitterly accusing ministers and the Whips’ Office, in charge of party discipline, of ‘disgraceful’ tactics. Ministers, meanwhile, were furious with Mr Bercow for triggering what they saw as an contrived furore. One senior Conservative said: ‘Bercow has completely lost the plot.’

Mr Cameron had promised to give MPs a vote on the warrant before a crucial by-election in Rochester and Strood.

But, fearing a damaging rebellion, Michael Gove’s whips’ office yesterday put forward a motion which excluded the warrant – which is by far the most controversial of the 35 EU measures the Government wants to opt back into. Instead, 11 more obscure powers were included on the Commons order paper.

But fury erupted when Mr Bercow declared at the start of the debate that, in fact, no vote on the arrest warrant was taking place – denying MPs a say.

In a vicious attack, the Speaker told MPs: ‘This has been a rather sorry saga and the House should not be put in this position.

‘I think most of us think a commitment made is a commitment that should be honoured and we should try to operate according to sensible standards rather than trying to slip things through some sort of artifice.

‘It may be the sort of thing that some people think is very clever but people outside of the House expect straightforward dealing and they are frankly contemptuous, and I use the word advisedly, contemptuous of what is not straight dealing.’ Arch-Eurosceptic Tory Sir Bill Cash said the vote was a ‘travesty of our parliamentary proceedings’.

‘It is tainted with chicanery, it is not the way this Parliament should be treated,’ he said.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, another Tory rightwinger, said the ‘outrageous abuse of parliamentary procedures’ meant the Government was taking ‘the way of tyranny’.

Backbench Tory Sir Richard Shepherd accused the Government of ‘sly’ behaviour, while former shadow home secretary David Davis said it had been the most disorderly debate he had seen in 20 years.

Labour’s shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘Despite being promised this vote, the Commons has been denied the chance to give overwhelming backing to this crucial crime-fighting measure.

‘Theresa May was very foolish not to listen to the strong support across the House both for the European Arrest Warrant and for the opportunity of a comprehensive vote.

‘She has handled this dreadfully. It’s a complete mess.’

The wounds suffered by the Tories last night will be seen by many as self-inflicted, since the European Arrest Warrant is backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats and would have passed with ease – even with a sizeable Tory rebellion.

At one stage, it was anticipated as many as 100 MPs might vote against. Even after yesterday’s farcical scenes, only 38 objected to the package.

The dispute comes after Mrs May decided two years ago to opt out of all 133 EU police and criminal justice measures.

Ministers then had until December 1 this year to decide which they wanted to opt back into.

Following Coalition negotiations, it was decided to re-join 35 – including the European Arrest Warrant. The EAW has been in force in Britain since 2004 but, had ministers opted not to re-join, it was due to lapse in less than three weeks.

It was created to ensure a warrant issued by a judge in one EU country could be enforced in another and is designed to speed up extradition proceedings.

But critics say it has been used to pursue Britons for relatively minor offences and object to the whole concept of a European-wide system of justice.
