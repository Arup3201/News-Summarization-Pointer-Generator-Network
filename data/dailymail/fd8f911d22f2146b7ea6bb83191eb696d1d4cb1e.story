Officials in Florida are withholding millions worth of compensation it was ordered to pay a young boy who was tortured by his adopted parents and found close to death next to the decomposing body of his twin sister.

The state settled a lawsuit following the gruesome deaths of Victor and Nubia Barahona in Palm Beach County in 2011, admitting they were at fault.

But the Florida Department of Children and Families and lawyers for the state Legislature want to put the deal on hold and delay final payments indefinitely, according to the Miami Herald. 

The state senate has stopped the payments, claiming that if a decision is passed it may imply that the father was liable in the abuse, even though he is on trial for his daughter's murder and is facing the death penalty.

The youngsters were sexually abused, starved and forced to sleep in a bathtub for years by Jorge and Carmen Barahona.

It was also revealed that they were forced to eat cockroaches consume food that contained feces. 

In a report published in 2011, the state said that there had been a 'systematic failure' in their safety net, after Nubia and Victor entered the welfare system as youngsters. 

The document stated that the tragic case showed a 'failure in common sense, critical thinking, ownership, follow-through and timely and accurate information sharing.'

Nubia's naked body was found in the back of Jorge's trunk in February 2011, with a badly injured Victor in the front seat. The boy was also covered in pesticides. 

The young boy was put into the care of another foster family after spending several weeks in the hospital.

His new foster mother told investigators that the sight of her putting on false eyelashes makes Victor remember how he lost his own lashes when his adoptive father glued his eyes shut.

He has a similar reaction when his new foster father filled up a pitcher of ice water: it brought Victor back to the days when his adoptive father Jorge Barahona would bind him and his twin sister Nubia up, put them in the tub, and douse them with ice.

The state initially approved a check for $1.25 million and sent it to help Victor and his new adoptive parents deal with the psychological trauma. 

According to the Herald they did not accept liability in the claim, but did agree not to oppose having the remaining $3.75 million in settlement funds come from the Legislature, in the form of a claim bill. 

However the DCF has stopped the payments to the family following a change of heart. 

State senate spokesman Katie Betta: 'At this point in time, as a matter of law, the father’s rights have not been terminated. That is a valid concern the Senate has to consider.'

Under state sovereign immunity laws, the state is shielded from having to pay more than $200,000 when it injures someone, unless the Legislature agrees to lift the cap.

General counsel of Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, George Levesque, was appointed to conduct a 'mini-trial' to assess the state's liability.

He decided that legislators would not vote on the claim bill this year as it may damage other cases related to child abuse at the hands of the Barahonas.

'The adverse finding of fact or conclusion contained in a claim bill could be used against [DCF] in the pending litigation,' Levesque said in an email to the lawyers for the family which was seen by the Herald. 

He added that Jorge and Carmen Barahona were Nubia’s legal parents at the time of her death. While Carmen’s rights have been taken away, Jorge could inherit any money in the child’s estate.

Neal Roth, the lawyer who negotiated the settlement claimed the decision was utter nonsense and said: 'The claim bill will be referred to at least one committee and that can easily be addressed by amending the bill to specifically exclude Mr. Barahona from ever receiving any money from the settlement of this case.'

'This is, in my experience, one of the saddest commentaries on the human condition that I've ever seen,' James Loftus, director of the Miami-Dade police, said previously about the family.

'It's depressing, it's sickening to think about the circumstances that led two people, working in concert, to perpetrate this kind of horror on their own children, adopted or not.'

He described the case as 'depressing [and] sickening.'

After Victor was hospitalized for several weeks after the incident, he was moved into the care of foster mother Katia Garcia.

Mrs Garcia met with police in June to discuss what she had learned from Victor about the extent of his abuse, and the horror of his experiences appears never-ending.

‘He really didn't want to remember, perhaps, but he did,’ she told investigators in a taped interview.

Victor is the most upset when talking about his sister Nubia, who was found wrapped in a garbage bag in the back of Jorge Barahona’s pick-up truck after being doused with chemicals.

‘He stutters when he talks. He can’t finish his sentences,’ Mrs Garcia said.

‘He has nervous twitches with his eyes. He had one with his mouth. He doesn’t want to talk about what his sister went through.’

Both of the twins were both starved while living in the Barahona house. They were only given a piece of bread and a glass of milk once a week while their parents and their two other adopted children dined on shredded beef and rice.
