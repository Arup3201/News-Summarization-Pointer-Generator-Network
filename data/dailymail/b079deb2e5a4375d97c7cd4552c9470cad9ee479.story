Manchester United's all-star squad have taken time out from their pursuit of Champions League qualification in the Premier League to attend a host of events for the club's foundation as part of their 'schools united' campaign.

Despite a disastrous 2-1 defeat at Swansea on Saturday, Louis van Gaal's side headed to ten schools within the Foundation's partnership for numerous causes, aiming at using sport to inspire the younger generations.

At each venue the players got involved in activities showcasing the Foundation's core delivery, including sports coaching, leadership workshops and even language lessons.

Captain Wayne Rooney was back in the classroom with defender paddy McNair to help out in lessons at Stretford High School on their 'Leading the United Way' programme on display. 

Touching on his own captaincy experience to advise the young leaders he said, 'You need to be confident – that's a big part of it, as well as being able to communicate well and clearly, which a lot of them did in the classroom. As a Manchester United player we're in a privileged position and it's great to come and down, see the kids and try to give them some advice.'

Meanwhile Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera took part in a training session run by the club's foundation to promote Girls Football Development, with the lucky participants from Astley Sports College had a kick around just outside Old Trafford. 

Burnage Academy hosted duo Angel di Maria ad David de Gea for a selection of sporting activities in a Manchester United Foundation event in aid of Premier League 4 Sport, which focuses on alternative sports, without a football in sight. 

Di Maria and de Gea appeared to be all-rounders, showing off sporting prowess in basketball, table tennis and even badminton.

Keeper de Gea, who impressed with his shooting skills, commented: 'Not everyone likes football, this way at least the kids have different choices of sports. I believe it's a great incentive that they have the opportunity to participate in different activities. It was very gratifying for us to be here today and to be able to play some activities with the kids.'

At Swinton, Juan Mata and Marcos Rojo took part in a Spanish Q&A after surprising students taking part in an 'FA Junior Football Leaders' refereeing session.

'The Foundation does great work with kids and I think it's great of the club,' said Juan. 'It makes us realise what football means to the kids and we just try to help in any way we can. It costs nothing for us to come here and make the kids happy and it can be very important for them.' 

The ten schools involved in the Back to School event are partnered with Manchester United Foundation through its Hub of the Community programme. A dedicated coach is based full-time in the high school to work with students, children from feeder primary schools, teachers, parents and partnership organisations to build lasting relationships in the local community. 

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will hope the change of scenery and positive atmospheres will help his star studded squad recover from the Swansea defeat to get back to winning ways against Sunderland on Saturday in the Premier League.
