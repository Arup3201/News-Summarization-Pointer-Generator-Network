After bitterly cold nights and mornings of spectacular frost, the country will be relieved that the end of the deep freeze is in sight.

But while the weather will be warmer by Friday, it will be accompanied by heavy rain and gales.

The band of rain preceding the warmer front will also see some of the country having a brief blanket of snow and sleet.

Much of Britain will have freezing fog and a hard frost today, with overnight temperatures having dropped as low as -10C (15F) in northern Scotland. The Department of Health has said the extreme cold snap was likely to add 'substantially' to the UK's winter death toll.

Mortality rises almost a fifth in winter, with 1,560 excess deaths a week. But Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said 'very severe weather' could add substantially to the increase, according to a report in the Sun newspaper.

Forecasters warn that the warm front 
crossing the country at the end of the week will bring strong winds, 
with gusts reaching 50mph along parts of the South Coast on Friday but a
maximum temperature of 12C (54F).

There will be heavy showers in the 
South and most areas will have some rain.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams 
said: ‘With a band of rain being blown in from the west over Thursday 
night, we will see transient snow and sleet, which will quickly melt as 
temperatures rise on Friday. But the warmer weather will be accompanied 
by strong rain and gale force gusts.

The cold spell of the past few 
days was due to bitter easterly winds but the warmer, wetter weather 
will spread from the west.

John Lee, forecaster at MeteoGroup, 
said: ‘It is turning unsettled from Thursday night onwards but for the 
next couple of days at least it’s going to stay very cold.

‘Tonight there will be a fairly sharp frost.’

A walker has died after falling 600ft in freezing conditions in the Lake District.

The unnamed man, who was with a 
friend, slipped on a patch of ice and plunged from the Lord’s Rake 
traverse path on Scafell – England’s highest mountain. He was pronounced
dead at the scene.

Meanwhile, police in Surrey were 
criticised for putting out a cold weather warning via Twitter yesterday 
parodying Vanilla Ice’s 1990 hit Ice Ice Baby.

They tweeted: ‘Ice Ice Surrey. Alright stop, collaborate and listen, Ice is back and these roads are glistening.’

One Surrey resident who read the 
tweet, Alan Harper, 43, said: ‘This song was a hit 22 years ago, so why 
the police think it’s relevant to Twitter users today shows they are a 
bit out of touch.’

But some good has come from the weather.

Rocester, in Staffordshire, woke yesterday to see a
gentle pink sky and their town cloaked in mist, while a brilliant 
crimson sun rose in Peterborough.

A sparkling frosty morning in Bristol
was a delight for walkers, while choir boys enjoyed the chilly weather 
as they skated around an ice rink in Winchester, Hampshire.

The frost coated Cheshire, lending the fields and plants a magical quality as they glittered in the bright winter light.

The appearance of waxwing birds could mean the bad weather is here to stay, if the old adage is true.

Waxwings are believed to be 
harbingers of glacial weather. In the mid-1960s, when 11,000 visited, it
was followed by one of the coldest winters on record.

Thousands
of waxwings have descended on Great Britain after the failure of the 
birds food sources in their native Scandinavian breeding grounds.

Birdwatchers
across the UK travel hundreds of miles to catch a glimpse of the rare 
birds, who turn up in significant numbers every few years, and are 
thought to be a sign of a harsh winter to come.

The
birds, which eat rowan, hawthorn and cotoneaster bush berries, are 
particularly fond of town centres, where there are ornamental trees – 
and supermarket car parks with berry hedges.

A waxwing winter is more properly known as an 'irruption'

Two years ago, after another big influx, temperatures plummeted.

Most years, only a few hundred arrive this month, returning to their breeding grounds in Scandinavia and Russia next spring.

But this year the beautiful birds have been seen in both Scotland and the south of England, which experts believe is down to the combination of a good breeding season and the failure of the birds’ food sources, forcing them to forage further.

They said tonight temperatures could drop to -5C across the country, with the Scottish Highlands experiencing up to -7C.

Across Britain today and tomorrow, the 
thermometer should hover between 2C and 5C, with fog expected to choke 
up a large part of England, stretching across central and southern 
areas, and spanning the Midlands to the Welsh borders.

But by Thursday night, there will be rain, sleet and snow across the country, although warmer weather is expected too.

Scotland
saw the chilliest temperatures, with the mercury dipping to -10.5C at 
Tulloch Bridge and Braemar in Aberdeenshire not far behind with -10.1C.

The birds eat rowan, hawthorn and cotoneaster bush berries, and are normally more at home in Scandinavia and Russia.

John
Lee, forecaster at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press 
Association, said parts of Cumbria dropped to as low as -6C, while many others parts of the country hovered around -1C and -2C on Monday night.

Mr Lee said: 'Across the board there was a very widespread frost - only a few coastal areas escaped the worst of it.'
