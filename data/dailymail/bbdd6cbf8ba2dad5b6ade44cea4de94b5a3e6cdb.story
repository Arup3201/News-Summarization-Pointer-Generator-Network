Former teen heartthrob David Cassidy allegedly fathered a secret love child during a one-night stand 40 years ago while he was on tour in Nashville, it emerged today.

North Carolina woman Shelly Wright said she wants her story made public because she is tired of being given the runaround by his agent and wants Cassidy to at least acknowledge her existence.

She has reached out to his publicist and his son on numerous occasions to try to get them to take DNA tests, but she has either been ignored or treated with hostility.

she wants her story made public because she is tired of being given the 
runaround and wants David Cassidy, left, to at least acknowledge her 
existence

Shelly Wright said to RadarOnline: 'I just want him to finally acknowledge me. I¿m not getting any younger and I just want some closure. I want to meet my dad'

Reach out: After having children of her own, Shelly
 contacted Cassidy's publicist Jo-Ann Geffen about the matter and 
received a curt email in return almost accusing Shelly, right, of trying to cash in on Cassidy's fame

Shelly made her claim to RadarOnline in the hope that it will get The Partridge Family star to end the decades of doubt and confusion she has suffered not knowing who her real dad is.

Katie Cassidy and David Cassidy: Shelly said she can see a striking resemblance between all three of them

Speaking to website she said:  'I just want him to finally acknowledge me. I’m not getting any younger and I just want some closure. I want to meet my dad.'

Shelly said she always had doubts as to who her real father was because she looked nothing like Nashville songwriter James Bohon, who is Shelly's mother's long-term partner.

'I didn’t look anything like him, and my whole family always talked about it,' she said. 'He always picked up my sister instead of me and had more of a relationship with her through the years. I was confused.'

When she finally confronted her mother  Donna Wallace, she admitted that when she and Bohon briefly separated in 1973, she slept with David Cassidy in a VIP room during a night out in Nashville.

When she fell pregnant, she went back to Bohon because she already had a child to him, even though she knew David Cassidy was the father all along.

After hearing the story, Shelley recalls: 'I was like, "Mom, my god, why didn’t you tell me that?!" And she was just like, "Google him and see who he is. He’s kind of cocky and arrogant".'

When she did Google him, she told RadarOnline she could not believe how much she looked both like him and his daughter Katie.

What's more, Cassidy admitted to having a lazy right eye and 
Shelly was diagnosed with the same usually-inherited condition in her right eye. 

After having children of her own, she
 contacted Cassidy's publicist Jo-Ann Geffen about the matter and 
allegedly received a curt email in return.

'If this is a sincere and legitimate 
interest to determine your family history, that is one thing,' Geffen 
wrote in the email, which was obtained by RadarOnline.com.

'If, on the other hand, as an adult you 
are trying to realize financial gain in any way or use David as a ploy 
to get publicity, I hope you will have the decency to stop now.

'If you 
truly think there is a chance you are related, you have integrity as he 
does and would not do anything to hurt anybody.'

Shelly said: 'This is not a gimmick. It’s not a game. I’m so irritated and desperate and I just want 
David to know that I’ve been trying to reach him about this'

Siblings? Shelly, right, believes she also bears more than a passing resemblance to Katie Cassidy, left, and wants her to know she has a half sister

After she persevered, Geffen finally agreed to have the former teen idol to a DNA test - at her expense - and sent Shelly one of, what she claimed to be, Cassidy's hairs.

But getting the feeling she was being tricked, Shelley called Geffen before she even had the results back to tell her the results were positive.

'David’s publicist flipped out on me and said, "Shelly, you’re a liar!" She told me that the hair wasn’t even from David’s head,' she told RadarOnline.

It was then she decided to contact David's son Beau Cassidy on Twitter.

At first, he seemed only too willing to help her and said she could send him a DNA kit. But that was weeks ago and she has not heard back.

'I feel like I’ve been screaming for a year, like, "Help!" This is not a gimmick. It’s not a game, she told RadarOnline. 'I’m so irritated and desperate and I just want David to know that I’ve been trying to reach him about this.

'My husband has a really good job and I don’t want money,' she insists. 'We have a good life. I just want David to come forward and acknowledge me.

'There’s a small hope that he does want to have something to do with me, and with his grandkids. I really want to get some closure.'
