Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher didn't hold back when discussing Arsenal's dressing room photo on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show.

Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has backed-up his ex-England team-mate Jamie Carragher by ripping into the craze of taking post-match dressing room pictures.

Speaking on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show, Sportsmail columnist Carragher criticised Aaron Ramsey and his Arsenal team-mates for taking a snap behind the scenes at the Etihad after their 2-0 win against Manchester City last weekend.

And Scholes, who believes the dressing room should be a private place, agrees that those sort of pictures should be reserved for when a team has won a trophy.

In his column for The Independent, Scholes wrote: 'It was Aaron Ramsey doing it on Sunday after Arsenal beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium, although I am told he is by no means the only offender. 

'In my world the dressing room was sacrosanct. The only time anyone was permitted to take pictures in there was when we had won a trophy. Unless I am wrong, Arsenal only got three points for beating City. It wasn't the European Cup final.'

Scholes spent almost 20 years in United's first-team and he insists that during his time at Old Trafford the dressing room was always respected as a place for the players, even by manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

He added: 'If you want a measure of how private a place the dressing room was when I was growing up at Manchester United, consider this: even Sir Alex Ferguson would knock before coming into the dressing room at the Cliff, the old training ground. The dressing room is for the players, and the players only. It was a rule respected by all the staff at Old Trafford.'

Dressing room pictures are commonplace these days, although Ferguson did his utmost to stop his United players posting them to social media sites according to Scholes.

'In my final couple of years at United we had one player, new to the team and young, who posted a picture from the dressing room on Instagram or Twitter,' Scholes wrote. 

'I won't embarrass him by naming him because that too would contradict the rules about what stays private. Safe to say, the manager went ballistic and the player never did it again.'
