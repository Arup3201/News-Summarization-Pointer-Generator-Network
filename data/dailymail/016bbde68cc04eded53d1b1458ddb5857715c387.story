‘They help you get over how sad it is,’ nine-year-old Heather told NBC.

Others are sending their love and condolences from across the country and around the world.

Over the weekend, NBC’s Ann Curry went on Twitter and asked people to imagine what would happen if everyone committed to #20acts of kindness to honor each child lost in Newtown.

Tens of thousands of people on both Twitter and Facebook increased the number to #26acts of kindness, to include the six teachers who lost their lives during the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Others are taking the ‘acts of kindness’ number even higher.

Many of those concerned locals and out-of-towners are helping bring these real-life surprises to Newtown, Connecticut.
