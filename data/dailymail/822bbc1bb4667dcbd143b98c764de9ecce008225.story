A group of parents in Miami, Florida are outraged that school officials allowed high school students to participate in an explicit rap music video, featuring Juicy J and Lil Wayne, that referenced drugs and sex.

Students from the Miami Northwestern Senior High band appeared in the video for Bands A Make Her Dance - which features scantily clad females frolicking around stripping poles and club scenes referencing drinking and drugs. 

Parents are shocked that the school gave permission to the students to don their band uniforms for the racy footage but the school is pleading ignorance, saying they didn't know much about the artist before they gave permission.

We didn't know: The Miami high school said they were ignorant of the song's theme when they allowed students to participate. Rapper Lil Wayne (front) raps in front of members of the high school band

In the video, the band members are 
standing to attention and playing their instruments - while the rappers 
prance before them and work through their material.

Shots of club partying and stripping are cut into the nearly 5 minute long video, that was uploaded to YouTube on September 24.

Bands is a street term for a thousand dollars and the high school students were included seemingly as an ironic gesture.

But now parents are shocked that the students were featured in such an explicit film.

Party: The music video glorified stripping and the club scene

A representative for the school says that the students were by themselves for the filming and were not engaged in or exposed to any of the activities presented in the film.

'The students were actually filmed by 
themselves,' John Schuster, the Miami-Dade County Public School’s Spokesperson told WBFS-TV, about the filming that occurred at a warehouse in Miami’s Wynwood District.

'It’s a process called blue screen or green 
screening, where the students stand in front of a blue or green wall all
by themselves and through the magic of video, they’re able to edit it 
together,' he explained.

Racy: Shots of the students were interspersed with scenes of strippers

Outrage: Parents and school officials were shocked when they screened the film

The school official said the administration was just as shocked as the parents when they reviewed the final product.

Shuster explained that the school granted permission for the band to participate but admitted they did know about the performers beforehand.

'We did know who the main artist was and parents did sign release forms,' Schuster added.

A representative from the school's 
alumni associate said they have reached out to Lil Wayne's management 
company, in an attempt to rectify the situation.

The school district is also said to be considering taking legal action over the incident.
