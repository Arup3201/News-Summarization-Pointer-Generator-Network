The man police alleged Phil Rudd hired to kill a rival has revealed he was offered cash and a fancy car to become the AC/DC drummer's bodyguard - not his hitman. 

He told The New Zealand Herald Rudd said he'll pay him $250,000 and any luxury car of his choice from the rock star's collection, which is worth an estimated $9 million.

Rudd, 60, is before the courts in New Zealand on charges of threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis.

The Tauranga-based drummer has denied the charges. 

In November, Rudd was also charged with attempting to procure a murder but it was dropped a day later.

Phil Rudd, seen here outside court on Thursday, allegedly threatened to kill a man and his daughter

A phone call in which Rudd allegedly threatened to kill a man and his daughter is the basis for the AC/DC band member's court charges.

In a summary of facts released to media last Friday, the Crown has given a brief outline of what led to the charges.

It says Rudd made a phone call to a man he knew, whose name is suppressed, on September 26, threatening to kill both him and his daughter. 

This was consistent with another phone call made by Rudd earlier that morning, the summary of facts said.

It says Rudd denied threatening to kill anybody and denied making any of the phone calls he was alleged to have made when he was interviewed by police.

Rudd was back in court on Thursday after a fracas with another man on a Tauranga street

The drug charges were laid after police executed a search warrant at Rudd's home on November 6. 

Police say Rudd had 0.71g of methamphetamine and 130g of cannabis in his possession.

Rudd was also charged with attempting to procure a murder when he appeared in court in November, but it was dropped by the crown solicitor the following day.

Rudd was back in court on Thursday after a fracas with another man on a Tauranga street.

He was filmed being handcuffed by police next to a black sports car by the side of Cameron Road, on the North Island of New Zealand and was then taken to the local station.

However, his lawyer Paul Mabey told Daily Mail Australia that Rudd is now back out on bail.

'He’s appeared on a breach of bail by speaking to a witness and has been rebailed. He’s been to court and gone home,’ Mr Mabey said. 

He was given an extra bail condition ordering him not to take illicit drugs.

The threatening to kill case is due back in Tauranga District Court on February 10, when a date for a judge-alone trial is likely to be set.
