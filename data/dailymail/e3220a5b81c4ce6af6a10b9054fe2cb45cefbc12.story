Bryant admitted ten counts of indecent assault against five boys between 1974 and 1985

Police have been forced to deny claims the force covered up the crimes of a paedophile policeman and allowed him to escape justice for 25 years.

Danny Bryant, 65, was finally jailed this week for six-and-a-half years for a decade of abuse involving five boys.

Many of the offences took place as he ran a police life-saving club - a role that saw him honoured by the Queen with the British Empire Medal.

One of his victims said Bryant abused him from the age of 14 and in 1988 he gave a detailed statement to police when he heard another boy had fallen into his clutches.

Tormented Russell Dawson, who waived his right to anonymity, said police wrote back saying they 'did not feel they had enough evidence to prosecute'.

His family then considered legal action but an officer allegedly visited them and warned about the 'horrendous ordeal' a civil case would be and they decided to drop it.

Bryant continued as a Pc in Devon and Cornwall Police until 1993 when the force was alerted a fourth time to his crimes when another victim came forward.

Mr Dawson said his mother offered to help
police investigate the fresh claims but was told they did not need her 
help and asked not to call them again.

Bryant was allowed to take early retirement the following year on ‘ill-health’ but was not arrested until April this year, when Mr Dawson demanded another investigation, and carried on working with life-saving clubs in North Devon.

He admitted ten counts of indecent 
assault against five boys between 1974 and 1985 and was jailed at 
Taunton Crown Court in Somerset on Thursday.

Many of the offences took place at the now-defunct Devon and Cornwall Police Surf Life-saving Club which he was a founder member of.

Jailing Bryant, of Bideford, North Devon, Judge David Ticehurst said it was 'a matter of regret that the force did not bring him to justice before'.

Mr Dawson, 44, who went to court to see Bryant jailed, said the disgraced officer started abusing him in 1983 and the effect on his life had been 'crippling and devastating'.

He said: 'It has been incredibly difficult getting on with my life.

'I only wish that the Devon and Cornwall Police had handled the matter differently when I first reported the abuse in 1988.

'I’m sure that would have prevented other children from being abused by this man in whom I had placed my trust.

'People must not be afraid to speak out against their abusers even if these people are respected in their community or hold a position of authority.'

Speaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Dave Thorn said: 'The reason it wasn’t prosecuted was not as a result of a cover-up. It was the result of insufficient evidence.

'Having said that, we are willing to learn lessons if there were investigative techniques which we used at the time were not up to scratch.'

Devon and Cornwall police said they voluntarily referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in April.

A spokeswoman added that the IPCC had determined that the case was suitable to be investigated locally and it had been referred back to the force.

The force said: 'Danny Bryant’s crimes have had a significant impact on the lives of his victims and we are doing everything possible to support them at what is an extremely difficult time.

'The fact that Danny Bryant committed these crimes while a serving police officer makes them all the more serious and an unforgiveable abuse of trust which the public should quite rightly give to a police officer.

'These offences are historic and safeguarding procedures have changed significantly since the 1980s when they have taken place.'

The IPCC have been contacted for a comment.
