Funny, isn’t it, how trends come around again. I started at Marks & Spencer in the early Seventies, when bell-bottom flares and denims filled the racks. Now, in 2015, they’re back in fashion.

What I’m more surprised about is seeing a Seventies throw-back in our politics.

Labour’s attack this week on a major British business smacked of the destructive anti-business mood that went out of political fashion decades ago.

Stefano Pessina — the boss of Boots the chemist — voiced his fears about the implications of a Labour government.

Some seemed unhappy about the fact that Mr Pessina is not a British citizen, with the view that somehow he had no right to comment. 

But more than 40 of the chief executives in the FTSE 100 companies are not British — and a quarter of the chairmen aren’t British either.

Why should they be disqualified from speaking about matters which are directly their concern?

As a man responsible for 70,000 workers — that’s 70,000 livelihoods supporting 70,000 families — Mr Pessina was perfectly entitled to speak out. What happens in Westminster has a direct impact on his employees and his customers.

But Labour reacted with furious attacks. There was a tide of derision from their backbenches; personal jibes about Mr Pessina and his ‘big mansion’; even slights against the boss of one of our best-loved High Street chains from the shadow business secretary himself.

Though some might dismiss this as just another political spat, to me it is more significant. It marks a turning of the tide that every business and worker in the country should pay attention to. For a long time, we seemed to have reached a consensus about business in Britain. Mainstream politicians agreed that business was not the enemy but the vital engine that kept our economy moving, creating jobs and opportunities.

There was an agreement that enterprise should be rewarded; that wealth-creators should not be squeezed ‘until the pips squeak’, as the Labour Chancellor Denis Healey is alleged to have said in the Seventies — but that they should be welcomed for the contribution they make to our economy, and the dynamism they bring.

The old days of punitive taxes on business-people, of class war and the stirring of resentment, seemed hopelessly old-fashioned.

Politicians on both the Right and Left were united in a belief that a strong economy was not, in the end, built by officials in Whitehall, but by enterprising individuals on High Streets and in offices up and down the country — and that beyond reasonable regulation and taxation, governments should let them get on with the job.

That was then.

Now, Ed Miliband and the Labour Party have blown that consensus apart. For the past few years, there has been a steady drum-beat of anti-business policies from Labour.

It started with a speech in which Ed Miliband labelled businesses as ‘predators’.

Labour has mooted a National Insurance rise that would squeeze small firms and make it less attractive to take on new workers.

It has proposed a hike in corporation tax — a policy which might play well to the gallery, but which would see British jobs being lost overseas.

Their ill-advised energy price freeze policy threatened investment into the UK. Most important, Labour lacks a clear and credible plan to deal with Britain’s remaining budget deficit.

Four decades of experience have taught me that businesses crave one thing above anything else: certainty.

If business leaders are to grow their firms, if investors are to put their money in the UK, they need to know that our economy is built on firm foundations. The prospect of more borrowing, spiralling interest rates and falling confidence is a worrying one, to say the least.

And all this is happening against the backdrop of a turbulent global economy — an economy in which winning deals, trading and making a living is a daily battle for businesses in Britain. 

I know how competitive this global economy is. If Britain gets bogged down in another era of sky-high taxes, over-regulation and business bashing, the jobs and the investment will simply go elsewhere — and the impact will be felt in shuttered shop fronts, empty High Streets and lengthening dole queues.

These are the very possible real repercussions of anti-business policy and rhetoric.

In my view, we need to back British businesses to the hilt; to hear their concerns and not attack them for having them.

Last year, during the Scottish referendum, we saw how attacks on businesses can quickly spin out of control. Businesses that voiced their concerns about the impact of independence — and stated their support for the Union — faced withering criticism and threats of boycotts.

One senior politician even talked about a ‘day of reckoning’ for businesses and banks that had dared to speak about the potential downsides of independence.

It was an extraordinary comment — a chilling comment — for any politician to make during what was a largely good-tempered debate about Scotland’s future.

But it underlined the danger of resorting to abuse and personal attacks when people raise genuine concerns. In a healthy, thriving democracy, people must be free to speak out without fear or favour. 

So I have a suggestion for Ed Miliband and Labour.

When you run a major retail business, as I have done, and a lot of your time is spent in boardrooms and meetings, it’s a good idea every now and again to ‘walk the floor’ — to get down onto the shop floor, get to know your staff, speak to customers and generally find out what is happening in the real world.

Miliband and his team should try doing the same. They should ‘walk the floor’ in Britain’s businesses to experience the reality they face: earning a living, keeping overheads down, paying the wages each month.

If they did, they would see that most firms, large or small, are made up not of greedy tycoons, but of men and women who work incredibly hard, who often commute long hours and who pay their taxes — like the 70,000 people who work for Boots.

This is the real face of British business. They aren’t the enemy. They are the backbone of our economy — and they deserve the support and respect of our politicians.
