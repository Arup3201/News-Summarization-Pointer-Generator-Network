Primary children are being told to take a safety test before riding their scooters to school.

Pupils who pass are issued with a permit they are told can be withdrawn if they are spotted causing a nuisance on the pavements.

The scheme was introduced at Thomas a Becket Middle School in Worthing, West Sussex, where headmaster John Gadd said police community support officers would explain the rules.

A letter from headteacher John Gadd appeared to say PCSOs who attended the course would take licences away from trouble-makes.

The plan infuriated parents who declared the plan was ‘ridiculous’ and ‘unworkable’ - but, after some confusion, Sussex Police yesterday insisted officers would ‘only offer safety advice’.

Mr Gadd first wrote to parents in November saying concerns had been raised with the school.

‘We have had a number of calls from local residents, some complaining about pupils from our school scooting in and around cars in cul-de-sacs near to the school and others concerned over the safety of our pupils,’ he said.

‘These latter calls have commented both on some pupils [sic] lack of road sense and the busy-ness of the roads in the local area.’ Although he ordered parents to stop their children taking scooters to school, he revealed he had been in contact with West Sussex Road Safety Team about setting up a safe-riding programme.

In a follow-up letter last month, he said the first session had gone ahead with ‘a large number of children from each year group’. A teacher and two PCSOs had been in charge and permits were being issued to pupils who passed.

He added: ‘We have made it clear to the children that if they are seen to be scooting unsafely on the way to or from school their permit will be withdraw immediately (the PCSOs have agreed to support us in this too, as well as recognising those who continue to scoot responsibly and safely).’ One mother said yesterday: ‘You hear all this stuff about the nanny state but I never expected this.

‘We’re talking about children on scooters - not teenagers on motorbikes. They’ll be terrified if they’re pulled over [by an officer] for being too enthusiastic on their scooters.’ Another parent said: ‘This is totally unworkable. If I’m happy for my son to use a scooter to school then no one can stop me.’ But one father commented: ‘I think it is a great idea that kids are being taught road sense. There are courses for kids on bicycles and this is the same sort of thing.’ Sussex Police were unaware of the agreement between the school and PCSOs when contacted and were unable to contact the officers.

The force later issued a statement which said: ‘Sussex Police welcome and support the idea of scooter permits as a way to keep children safe when travelling to and from school.

‘However, the introduction of scooter permits is a school initiative and officers are there to offer safety advice and not enforcement.’ The school has around 750 boys and girls aged eight to 12 and was rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2011.

It failed to respond yesterday to a request for information about how many complaints had been received, whether any children - or pedestrians - had been injured and if the PCSOs had offered to enforce the rules.

A West Sussex County Council spokesman said: ‘This is something for the school rather than the local education authority.’
