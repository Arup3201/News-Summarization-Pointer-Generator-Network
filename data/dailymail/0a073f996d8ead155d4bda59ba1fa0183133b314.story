Maryann Jacobsen warns against 'clean your plate'

A leading nutritionist has slammed the age-old practice of encouraging your child to clean their plate at mealtimes.

'Controlling feeding practices, like "clean your plate", negatively affect food regulation skills as children age,' writes dietitian and family nutrition expert Maryann Jacobsen.

Maryann notes: 'With all the negotiations at the table, children lose sight of their internal signals of hunger and fullness.

'By the time they are adults, the "shoulds" of eating rule over their body’s own wisdom and they don’t even know what being full means.

'Researchers at the University of 
Minnesota found that young adults who used hunger and fullness to guide 
eating not only had a lower body mass index than those who didn’t, they 
also had lower instances of disordered eating.

'The girls were also less likely to diet and binge-eat,' writes Maryanne in the New York Times,

The
 same study found children who are allowed to guide their eating through
 intuition grow into adults with lower rates of disordered eating and 
diet less.

A study published in the May edition of journal Pediatrics
 found half of all parents expect their adolescent children to clean 
their plates, while a third prompted them to eat more - even after they 
stated they were full.

Researchers
 found this to be detrimental to children's wellbeing and suggest 
parents guide children to eat in moderation rather than encourage over 
consumption.

A psychologist
 and research leader at Queensland University of Technology studied 
children's eating habits and concluded those who grow up with eating 
disorders strive to take control over their body - something which they 
may feel has somewhat been taken away from them.

Dr Linda Gilmore. said: 'Parents 
should not turn mealtime into a struggle for control, because some 
evidence suggests that eating disorders such as anorexia stem from a 
desire to take control over one's own body.

'If children are forced to sit at 
the table until they eat it this turns into a struggle for who has 
power over the child's eating habits which could well set the scene for 
later eating problems.'

A 2007 study published in the journal Appetite found 85 per cent of parents tried to get children to eat more.

Eighty-three per cent of children ate
 more than they might otherwise have, with 38 per cent eating moderately
 to substantially more.

Parents would used reasoning, praise, 
and food rewards, mothers being more inclined to praise girls for eating
 while fathers would use pressure tactics with boys.

The researches concluded that 'it may be
 that parents are inadvertently socialising their children to eat past 
their internal hunger/satiety cues' and that their data 'reinforces 
recommendations that parents should provide nutritious foods and 
children, not parents, should decide what and how much of these foods 
they eat'.

'A "happy plate" is one in front of a child who’s permitted to listen to her body,' writes Maryanne.

'Not our out-of-date rules.'

Maryann is co-author of the new book Fearless Feeding: How to Raise Healthy Eaters From High Chair to High School.
