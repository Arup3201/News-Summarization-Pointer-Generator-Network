As excitement builds for the Queen’s Jubilee, spoilsport council officials in one town have put a serious dampener on preparations by traders.

Patriotic shop owners in Cheltenham want to hang Union flag and Olympics bunting across the road outside their businesses.

But health and safety officials said they need to take out a £5m insurance policy to cover the cost of redirecting traffic while the flags are put up.

Frustration: High street traders along Bath Road in Cheltenham have had to abandon plans to hang bunting across the road because council chiefs are insisting they take out £5million insurance cover

Shopkeepers had planned to hang the string of red, white and blue flags in an eye-catching zig-zag pattern down the length of the street, echoing scenes from other towns across the country.

Members of the Bath Road Traders’ Association have now scrapped the display - and instead plan to simply hang the bunting in parallel lines above the pavement.

The news is an upsetting blow for resident Joan Clifford, 78, who painstakingly stitched the strings together and measured them exactly to fit the street.

But Gloucestershire Highways insisted on a raft of safety measures when erecting the display, including road closures, diversions and the hire of hydraulic cherry-pickers.

Officials ruled that any such an operation would require £5million worth of public liability insurance.

Lizzie Smith, chairman of the association, said she thought the ruling was unnecessary: 'It is rules for rules and they are a bunch of party poopers,’ she said.

Patriotic: Members of Bath Road Traders' Association with the Olympic bunting they made. It will now be hung along the street instead of zig-zagging across it

Proud: Residents had even marked the bunting so it would fit exactly between lampposts when it was strung across the road.

'We were happy to hire a cherry picker to get up there and would have paid for that ourselves.

'But nobody was willing to take on a £5 million public liability policy, which is quite understandable.'

The association began planning decorations for the Olympic torch and

Jubilee following a successful Christmas party on the street.Local resident Mrs Clifford, from Leckhampton, offered to hand make bunting and the shops launched an appeal for fabric donations.

The talented seamstress and her friends painstakingly cut and made the bunting in red, white and blue for the Jubilee and blue, yellow, black, green and red for the Olympics.

They even marked the bunting so it would fit exactly between lampposts when it was strung across the road.

Killjoys: Highways officials said they are not asking for insurance to cover the bunting, but to cover the risks associated with installing it

Ms Smith, manager of homemade food shop Cook, added: 'It would have looked so much better if we had been able to string it across the street.

'I think it is amazing that a 78-year-old woman came forward and volunteered to make the bunting, which was such a massive job. Imagine cutting it all.

'She had specially made it so that it would fit perfectly between the lampposts, there were even tabs with instructions sewn into the bunting to say where it went.

'I have seen other towns with bunting strung across the road and I’m sure there wasn’t all this fuss.'

The 45-member association was hit with a letter from Gloucestershire Highways five weeks before the Olympic torch passed through the street last week.

Result: Traders said they would be looking into the possibility of taking out insurance for future events

Thousands of locals lined popular Bath Road to see the iconic torch as it made its way through Cheltenham.

Ms Smith added that the association had not looked into the cost of buying a £5 million public liability policy but would do so for future events.Chris Riley from Gloucestershire Highways said the £5 million insurance would have covered the disruption of erecting the bunting.

He said: 'We are not asking for insurance to cover the bunting, but insurance is needed to put it up as a traffic management plan would have to be put in place to put it up and take it down and for a cherry picker to be used.

'It is the installation process which needs covering and it is exactly the same for the district council when they put the Christmas lights up for example.

'Cheltenham Borough Council would already have liability insurance for this if they were to put it up.'
