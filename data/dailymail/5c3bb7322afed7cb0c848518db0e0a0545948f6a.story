A rape victim who met the man who attacked her on a Christian dating website is filing a lawsuit against him and his family.

Katie Kuhlman, 24, is suing Sean Patrick Burns, who she met on ChristianMingle, for the sex attack and his mother for defamation after she sent a Facebook message to her brother last year indicating she had lied about the rape.

According to the complaint, the message read: 'I'm wondering if you are aware of your sister, Katie's accusation that she was raped in November 2012 and that she testified in a trial this summer which has sent an innocent man to prison?'

Suing: Rape victim Katie Kuhlman is suing Sean Patrick Burns for the attack and his mother Cheryl for defamation. She was accused of lying about the attack in a Facebook message sent to her brother

The lawsuit was filed last week in San Diego Superior Court.  

Sean Patrick Banks, a former lieutenant in the United States Navy, was convicted of two counts of forced penetration, one count of forcible rape, and one count of rape of an intoxicated woman.

An El Cajon jury found Banks, who was 39, guilty of raping two women, including Kuhlman, in 2012 and 2009. He was sentenced to 37 years to life in prison.

During the sentencing phase of his trial, Banks said he would waive his right to appeal if the women whose testimony led to his conviction would submit to a polygraph test.

Gloria Allred, the attorney for one of his victims, said: 'To now suggest that the victims should take a polygraph test after they endured cross examination and the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that Banks was guilty is insulting to the jury and the victims.'

But Ms Kuhlman did submit to a test — and passed.

'I was more interested in taking it because of the comment he made about dropping his appeal if I would pass a lie detector test,' she said. 'I passed my test. I don't know if he's going to drop his appeal.'

The result did not stop Banks' family from contacting her. His mother, Cheryl, sent Kuhlman's brother a message on Facebook that read, 'we pray every day that Katie will feel convicted by the Holy Spirit and tell the truth about what happened. I'm sorry to say, she has not.'

Her lawyer, Dan Gilleon, told NBC 7 that 'it was outrageous and despicable the way she reached out to a victim of rape, her family and said 'Your sister is lying.'

He said the message not only accuses Kuhlman of perjury, but also questioned her faith. 

'This mother is exploiting the name of God to really try to hurt my client, just like her son did,' Gilleon said.

 She is seeking damages for rape, false imprisonment, hate violence and defamation.
