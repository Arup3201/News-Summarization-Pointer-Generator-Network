It is a record collection so prized that even the British Museum considered housing it to preserve for future generations.

Now for the first time the public will be able to peruse famed Radio 1 DJ John Peel’s unique record collection.

In a new venture by the BBC and the Arts Council a dedicated culture channel will broadcast on Freeview and through a special website.

One of the biggest draws of the project - entitled The Space – is that it will feature a virtual recreation of the late broadcaster’s home studio and library.

Fans will be able to click on a link that takes them into his studio and to flick through his record collection, radio sessions and view unseen documentary footage.

Peel’s widow Sheila Ravenscroft and the John Peel Centre for Creative Arts have put the project together.

In a video clip for the site, she said: ‘John’s record collection is one of the most important in the world.

‘The Space project is allowing people to have a small insight into what is there. Hopefully people are going to really enjoy having a little bit of John’s collection.’

Yesterday the first 100 albums from his collection were made available for fans to rifle through.

Each week from now until October a further 100 will be released in alphabetical order of the artist.

Over six months, 2,600 albums will be unveiled from his collection – and there have already been a few surprises.

Peel is best loved for championing new, unusual or little known artists and transforming them into stars but his collection includes pop favourites such as Abba, A-Ha and Adam and The Ants.

Users can then click on the record and see Peel’s meticulously typed files detailing artist, title and tracks.

Copyright laws mean that the music cannot be streamed or downloaded from the site but links are included, if they are available, where users can click through to sites where you can buy or listen to music legally such as Spotify, SoundCloud and iTunes.

Mrs Ravenscroft said that the contents of each batch of records would be a closely guarded secret until they were uploaded but hinted fans would be “intrigued and amused”.

She added: ‘Each week we are choosing the first hundred of each letter of the alphabet and giving some information on what is there, what John particularly starred and his favourite tracks.

‘Within that there will be one artist that we particularly feature.’

In addition to his records, music lovers will also be able to listen to vintage sessions and browse photographs that span his forty year career in broadcasting.

 * Peel owned 25,000 LPs, 40,000 singles, and thousands of CDs

* The British Library expressed an 
interest in housing his record collection because of its range and 
cultural value, after his death

* 'Teenage dreams so hard to beat' from his favourite Undertone’s song Teenage Kicks, is etched on his tombstone

* Peel’s own meticulous cataloguing 
helped fuel the idea for the 'online museum' as he made a filing card 
for every album detailing the title, the band’s name and the tracks on 
it

* He began the collection in 1969 and added to it every year until his death in 2004

* The first album in his virtual studio 
is folk singer Mike Absalom 1968’s Save the Last Gherkin for Me - number
00001 in Peel’s catalogue system

* He also had a more exclusive “record 
box” which had 142 records of his essential music including work by Marc
Bolan, The Beatles, The White Stripes, and Laurie Anderson

There is also previously unseen documentary material and Peel’s own videos, including footage of him at home in Suffolk, travelling in Europe and at his beloved Liverpool’s Anfield stadium.

Hundreds took to social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to tell of their excitement to have access or see the catalogue.

One fan said: ‘This could actually be years of musical inspiration. Brilliant.’

Peel was hugely popular and was Radio 1’s longest serving DJ when he died, aged 65, in October 2004.

He became one of the first DJs to give exposure to punk and hip-hop, and among the bands whose fortunes he helped transform in Britain are Pulp, The Smiths, and Nirvana.

His Peel Sessions programme built up international acclaim and he could also be heard on the BBC’s World Service.

He had a heart attack while on a working holiday with his wife in Peru. He had been married to Sheila for 30 years and had four children William, Alexandra, Tom, and Florence.

The Space has a dedicated website and will broadcast on Freeview channel 117 as part of a six month pilot project.The Arts Council has invested £3.5 million in the project while the BBC is providing technological and digital archive expertise.

Other projects that will feature on the site include a first film season from the British Film Institute.

It will screen the debut movies of such acclaimed directors as Ridley Scott, Stephen Frears and Ken Russell.

In addition, the BFI screen through The Space two re-mastered silent films by Alfred Hitchcock.

The acclaimed director had such success with his later works such as Psycho, Vertigo, M for Murder and The Birds, that his silent work is often forgotten.

But the arts channel will show 1927 drama The Ring, which follows a tangled love triangle set against the backdrop of boxing, and 1928 film Champagne about a young women forced into work after her father claims they are destitute.

Performances from Sadler’s Wells, exhibitions and live events from The Serpentine, and a new season of all 37 of Shakespeare’s plays from the Globe Theatre, are among the other items lined up.

Alan Davies, chief executive of Arts Council England, said: ‘Today The space opens a new door into the cultural universe – one that offers a glimpse of a future where people can explore the arts whenever they want and wherever they are.’
