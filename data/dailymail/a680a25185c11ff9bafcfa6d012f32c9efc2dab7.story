The evidence that sealed the convictions of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher is far from conclusive, a new investigation claims.

On the eve of the retrial of the former lovers in Florence, a documentary has asked five key questions about the case against them.

Miss Kercher, 21, a European Studies student from south London, had her throat slashed on November 1, 2007, at her apartment in Perugia, Italy. She shared the flat with Knox, from Seattle, Washington.

Following a fast-track trial in 2008, Rudy Guede, 20, was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to 30 years jail, later reduced to 16.

Knox and her Italian boyfriend Sollecito faced trial the following year and were also found guilty.

Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito 25 but their guilty verdicts were quashed in 2011 and Knox returned to Seattle.

However, this year the Italian courts made the decision to have a retrial. It opens on Monday and could last a month - but Knox is not attending.

If she is found guilty again, Italy could apply for her extradition.

The new investigation - conducted for a Channel 5 documentary - follows criminal lawyer Fulvia Guardascione, for the prosecution, and criminal litigator Alexander Guttieres, for the defence, as they scrutinise the case in an attempt to find out what happened.

Using a purpose-built reconstruction of the Villa de la Pergola, the Perugia home shared by Miss Kercher and Knox, the opposing lawyers set about a CSI-style investigation, consulting with crime-scene specialists including experts in glass shatter, self defence, DNA and sound.

Employing high-speed cameras, forensic powder and hi-tech audio equipment, they attempt to answer five key questions that remain about one of the most infamous murders of the last decade.

Lone killer? Rudy Guede was 
found guilty of Miss Kercher's murder after a fast track trial in 2008

In the 2009 trial it was argued that Miss Kercher's body showed few or no defence wounds.

To the prosecution it meant multiple people had to be involved in her murder - restraining Meredith while she was killed.

But the defence argued that it would have been possible for Guede to commit the crime on his own.

For the TV investigation Eric Baskind,
a martial arts expert, used a set exactly the same size, layout and 
dimensions as the villa in which Miss Kercher was killed.

He
tested if he could restrain a model and inflict the fatal knife wound 
without the help of others and found that one person could have carried 
out the attack.

However, he said, to do so would have been 'considerably more 
difficult'.

Mr Guttieres said: 'I don't think that was conclusive.'

On the night of the murder a smashed window was discovered in the room of Filomena Romanelli, flatmate of Miss Kercher and Knox.

The rock used to break the glass lay inside.

To the defence, this was Guede's way in. But the prosecution argued that this was a cover-up to hide the killer's tracks.

How was the window broken? Glass shatter specialist Greg Waite investigated the physics of the smashed window that was discovered in the room of Filomena Romanelli, flatmate of Miss Kercher and Knox

To establish whether the window was broken from inside or out, the investigation lawyers recruited forensic glass specialist Greg Waite.

Returning to the scale set, Mr Waite set about throwing a similar rock through a window from the outside-in and then repeated it from the inside-out.

After consulting the limited crime scene photographs, he concluded that it was 'more likely' that the rock had come from the outside.

He said examining ridge marks of the shards of glass would conclusively determine the direction the rock was thrown.

During the 2009 trial the prosecution case relied heavily on placing both Knox and Sollecito at the scene.

Traces of Sollecito's DNA were found on Miss Kercher's bra clasp. But at the appeal case his lawyers argued that the clasp had been moved by police and contaminated.

To test if this theory could be correct, the documentary team consulted John Manlove, an expert in forensics.

He applied colourless powder on his hands (a substitute for DNA) before shaking hands with the lawyers. Lights showed how the powder was transferred easily.

Guttieres said: 'The police conducted a Mickey Mouse investigation based on presumption, conjecture and intuition and it frightens me to death to think that you can go to jail for a very long time based on that evidence.'

Did he leave the footprint? Raffaele Sollecito was convicted alongside Knox of Miss Kercher's killing, but his conviction was also quashed on appeal

An unidentified bloody footprint was found on a bathmat in Miss Kercher's home.

Its size appeared too big to be Knox's but if the prosecution could prove it belonged to Sollecito, then it would place him at the murder scene.

According to the TV prosecution, Sollecito has a unique arched toe.

Forensic podiatrist Dr Sarah Reel carried out a test using ink and a sheet.

It demonstrated that an arched toe would provide distinct imprints in either a walking or a standing position.

Dr Reel recommended further footprint tests should be taken at the retrial.

Guttieres said: 'That could make a difference in terms of identifying the print and whether it is Sollecito's or not.'

Guardascione agreed a similar test at the trial could be crucial to the defence or prosecution case.

Placing more than one person at the crime scene could prove vital to the prosecution's case.

Key witness Nara Capezzali claims to have heard at least two people running away from the scene.

Sound
engineer Dr Giancarlo Strani was called in by the documentary team to 
establish whether noise of someone running on the metal stairs outside 
Meredith's home could be heard from inside Nara's flat.

Using high-tech audio equipment, Dr Strani concluded it was 'impossible' to hear running on the metal stairs.

Guttieres said: 'We heard the audio specialist say "impossible", you can't get any more conclusive an answer.'

However,
Guardascione argued the different conditions had to be considered 
before dismissing any of the witness testimonies. She said: 'We had 
different stairs, we had a different environment, we were in a different
period of the year.'
