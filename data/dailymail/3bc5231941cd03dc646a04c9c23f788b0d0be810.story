The Fire Department of New York says three retired firefighters who worked at ground zero have died on the same day from 9/11-related illnesses.

Lt. Howard Bischoff and firefighters Robert Leaver and Daniel Heglund died Monday.

Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro says their deaths are 'a painful reminder that 13 years later we continue to pay a terrible price for the department's heroic efforts.'

Lt Bischoff and firefighter Leaver grew up together in Brooklyn and were childhood friends. Firefighter Heglund (center) served 20 years with the FDNY and died the day before his 59th birthday

The three worked at ground zero after the World Trade Center attacks, and stayed with the department for around two decades. One had leukemia, one had esophageal cancer and a third had colon cancer.

Firefighter Heglund died one day before his 59th birthday.

It says first responders showed health problems soon after the attacks, with 99 percent of exposed firefighters reporting at least one new respiratory illness.

The FDNY lost 343 firefighters on 9/11 and has recorded more than 850 firefighter and ambulace workers deaths to cancers connected to ground zero work. 

'The New York City Fire Department was the only agency that had health data on firefighters pre-9/11,' fire union president Stephen Cassidy told CBS New York. 'The study that they did in the first year after 9/11 showed that firefighters lost 12 years lung capacity in the blink of an eye.'

A group of lawmakers are currently working to pass a bill that would extend medical benefits to 9/11 first responders. 

The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation reauthorization Act would extend benefits offered by the original Zadroga bill which are set to expire in two years. 

The new bill would extend those benefits for another 24 years. 

The names of the three firefighters will be added to a special memorial for 9/11 firefighter first responders.
