A skateboarder was assaulted when he came to the aid of two Muslim women who were being verbally abused.  

The 26-year old woman was driving her mother in Newcastle, NSW, when a member of the public approached her vehicle.

What happened next caught the attention of Patrick Burgess, 24, who was in Newcastle to visit his friends.

‘We were skateboarding on obstacles that we brought to the netball courts on high street in Newcastle west,’ he said.

‘It was unclear from where we were, but it sounded like he was screaming miscellaneous racial abuse at them.’

Things quickly turned hostile when Mr Burgess defended the woman and her mother.

‘As soon as we said something the man turned to us. He was clearly very aggressive. We tried to diffuse the situation but to no avail.’

Police claim the man threatened to kill Mr Burgess and his friends, then allegedly stole two of their mobile phones and ran down the street.

Mr Burgess, who works as an engineer, says people should be more willing to step in if they witness similar incidents

‘The guy attempted to attack us several times before he assaulted me, at which stage I had to physically protect myself,’ he said

Afterwards, Mr Burgess consoled the women and waited for police to arrive before offering statements.

The incident is the latest anti-Muslim crime in Australia following a series of terror raids and comes days after the Abbott Government declared war on the Islamic State.

Despite this, Mr Burgess said he would not hesitate to help if he witnessed a similar incident. 

‘We could see that there was an issue and it was clear they needed help. There were several cars driving past throughout the event, none of which stopped to see what was going on,’ he said.

Mr Burgess, who works as an engineer, said the public are too reluctant to step in when they witness people being persecuted.

‘The indifference of good people largely allows events like this to occur. If extremists like this man knew that the public would stand up and take action, they would be far less inclined to do so,’ he said.

Mr Burgess said he would not hesitate to help if he witnessed a similar incident, and that ‘the indifference of good people largely allows events like this to occur'

Mr Burgess said he drew a clear line in the sand with the recent spate of racial attacks in Australia.

‘It's absolutely appalling. No one deserves to be treated like those women were treated. They were innocently driving past and were attacked for no reason at all. How can that be justifiable?, he said.

‘I strongly believe that the people who are committing these crimes are a small minority of extremists who unfortunately attract the majority of media attention (similar the Islamic State).

‘It’s up to the greater public to start actively condemning these actions, looking out for one another, and talking about this issue to hopefully influence a greater understanding of what is going on, rather than just ignoring it and allowing it to perpetuate.’

The suspect was later arrested a short distance away and was taken to Newcastle Police Station where he was charged with intimidation,assault, larceny  and malicious damage.
