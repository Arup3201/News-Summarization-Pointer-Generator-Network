Murder suspect Christopher Dorner, a former Los Angeles Police officer wrote a 'manifesto' about racial prejudices and corruption within law enforcement

Former LAPD officer Christopher Dorner tried to persuade fishermen in San Diego to take him to Mexico before he went on a deadly shooting spree, it has been alleged.

The cop-turned-fugitive died from a single gunshot wound to the head following a nine-day manhunt.

His body was pulled out of a cabin in Big Bear Lake last week following a shootout with police.

But now fishermen at Driscoll Wharf, in San Diego, have told NBC 7 that Dorner was on the pier near Nimitz and Harbor Island Drive on February 5 trying to charm his way into a boat ride to Mexico.

Jeremy Smith, a local fisherman, said: 'He kept saying he wanted to go fishing off Mexico. I said ‘Mexico? That’s kinda weird. You could go fishing on the bay.'

According to Smith and other fishermen, Dorner was willing to pay $200 to $400 for someone to take him out to sea.

He told the fishermen he was going to be deployed to Afghanistan but wanted to go fishing in Mexico before he left.

Smith said he offered to show him around a luxury yacht that was for sale but asked him to remove his military boots which he declined to do so.

Smith added: 'Maybe he had a gun. Usually people want to see inside.'

San Diego Police Lt. Andra Brown said she was not aware of Dorner being spotted in San Diego but that an investigation was ongoing.

Dorner is accused of murdering the daughter of an ex-LAPD captain and her fiance on February 3 and shooting dead an officer in cold blood.

Thousands of police officers throughout Southern California and Nevada searched for Dorner, a former Los Angeles officer during the manhunt

Three further police personnel were shot and wounded while he was on the loose, and another died in the final siege at the ski resort of Big Bear.

It is believed he carried out the attack as revenge after he was dismissed from the LAPD in 2008 on a charge of making false statements.

He also posted a 6,000-word manifesto online about the decision made five years ago to dismiss him and made accusations that racism remained rife in the police force.

Dozens of protesters rallied outside Los Angeles police headquarters yesterday. 

Protesters told the Los Angeles Times they didn't support Dorner's deadly methods, but objected to police corruption and brutality, and believed Dorner's claims of racism and unfair treatment by the department.

Many said they were angered by the conduct of the manhunt that led to Dorner's death and injuries to innocent bystanders who were mistaken for him.

Michael Nam, 30, who held a sign with a flaming tombstone and the inscription 'RIP Habeas Corpus,' said it was 'pretty obvious' police had no intention of bringing Dorner in alive.

'They were the judge, the jury and the executioner,' Nam said. 'As an American citizen, you have the right to a trial and due process by law.'

During the hunt for Dorner, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck called for Dorner's surrender and said he didn't want to see the suspect or anyone else injured.

These masked men asked for additional investigation into why Dorner was not able to be captured alive

Others wanted to call attention to police brutality, while downplaying that Dorner was accused of killing four people

Dorner has already inspired a burgeoning subculture of followers.

While most don't condone killing, they see him as an outlaw hero who raged against powerful forces of authority, and some even question whether he really died.

Another tribute includes a ballad titled 'El Matapolicias,' or 'The Police Killer,' penned by a Mexican crooner with lyrics paying homage to Dorner.
