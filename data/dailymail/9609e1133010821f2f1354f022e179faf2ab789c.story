Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso slipped in a sly dig at the Merseyside club's rivals Manchester United while saying goodbye to Real Madrid team-mate Angel Di Maria on Twitter ahead of the Argentina international's expected move to Old Trafford. 

Di Maria is edging closer to a record £60million move to United after turning down a new contract at the reigning European champions.  

In his tweet Alonso made reference to Di Maria's Champions League heroics against Atletico Madrid in May: 'Thanks for everything Fideo! I wish you all the best, even at Manchester Utd :) never forget the zigzag in extra-time in Lisbon.'

Real manager Carlo Ancelotti has already said Di Maria has said goodbye to his team-mates as he prepares to join Louis van Gaal's side.

Real's asking price for Di Maria has reportedly increased during negotiations as it became clear how desperate United were to add quality to their squad.

'Di Maria has said goodbye,' Ancelotti said in a press conference.

'We thanked him for everything he has done for the club.
