A national park was subjected to an accidental revamp when a truck carrying thousands of gallons of yellow paint missed a curve and spilled its contents over the picturesque scenery.

The truck plunged off the highway and rolled 200 feet down a steep slope into Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico.

Park officials are now assessing the mess left behind after the accident on Tuesday.

Paint the town: The truck carried on down the steep slope and spilled over two thousand gallons of yellow paint

The truck was carrying about 2,200 
gallons of road striping paint when it missed a sharp curve and came off the road.

Rescue crews pulled the lucky driver back to the highway where he was treated for a few bumps and bruises.[related]

The paint was spread over nearly an acre, and diesel fuel leaked from the truck.

By Wednesday, the paint had congealed and workers were able to remove the clumps by hand.

A team from Los Alamos National Laboratory helped with the diesel leak.

Monument staffers are now identifying the paint's toxicity and assessing environmental effects.

They say the spill is visible from roads and trails in and around the monument.
