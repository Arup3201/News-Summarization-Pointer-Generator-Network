A race car driver was involved in a horrific crash Saturday afternoon.

Larry Dixon was completing his qualifying run at the Amalie Motor Oil NHRA Gatornationals at Auto Plus Raceway in Gainesville, Florida when his car, traveling at 280mph, broke in half and then launched 30 feet in the air.

The car then came crashing down and slammed into a guardrail.

Most shocking of all however was that Dixon was then able to walk away from the crash.

'I was just waiting for it to land,' Dixon told USA Today. 

'I was just wanting it to land on the track and not in the dirt. That's the biggest deal. Going that fast, you can tumble. That isn't good for your insides. Everything did its job. My car's a mess, but I'm still here.'

He then said he is not sure what caused the nose of the car to break off, and would not comment on whether or not he would race again on Sunday.

'We haven't had any discussions about tomorrow,' he said. 

'We're still pretty fresh on it. … You're going to have to tune in and watch. I don't know yet.'

The car then came crashing down and slammed into a guardrail

Somehow Dixon was able to walk out of the car with no major injuries after the crash

Dixon (above), 48, was involved in a similar crash in 2000, during which he said his eye 'literally popped out of its socket'

He also broke his leg.

'It's like a roller-coaster ride that flies off the track,' he said. 

'Now what are you going to do? You just have to wait to land and hope everything does its job for you.'
