One of Britain’s most wanted criminals has been captured as he sunbathed by a pool at his luxury Spanish villa.

Armed robber Andrew Moran was sipping a cocktail alongside his girlfriend Genna Harvieu when armed police raided his hideout.

The 31-year-old attempted to escape but was rugby tackled to the ground. At one point he was hurled over a wall before being subdued.

Moran's arrest was carried out by elite police from Spain's Special Group of Operations, who protect VIPs as well as deal with terrorist attacks

Video footage released yesterday shows
police surrounding Moran’s home in the resort of Calpe near Alicante 
before chasing him into bushes after he spotted one of the officers and 
tried to escape.

Moran was part of an armed gang which 
stole £25,000 from a Royal Mail security van outside an Asda supermarket
in Lancashire in May 2005.

He has been on the run since vaulting 
over the dock during his trial at Burnley Crown Court in February 2009. 
He was convicted in his absence, and he was later placed on 
Crimestoppers’ top-ten most wanted list.

Since fleeing to Spain, Moran moved 
around frequently and assumed false identities in a bid to evade 
capture. He regularly changed his appearance, growing a moustache and 
his hair, and sometimes wore spectacles.

Last year he narrowly avoided being 
caught by ramming two police cars with his 4x4 and hurtling down a 
motorway the wrong way. A search of the house he was living in at the 
time uncovered a handgun, ammunition and 5kg of cannabis.

He charted his life on the run with 
photos of himself in various locations and poses. One picture showed him
in front of the  Eiffel Tower in Paris and he posed for another with 
two Uzi machine guns. Investigators believe that he financed his  life 
as a fugitive by becoming involved in drug dealing.

Guns, cartridges and several mobile phones were seized from his home

A pair of guns and cartridges were found among Moran's possessions

Last night a source close to the 
investigation said: ‘Moran was regarded as a very dangerous man – as his
access at different times to different firearms clearly demonstrates.

‘He was taken by surprise because he 
was lounging around the pool with his girlfriend, obviously thinking all
was well. I hope he enjoyed his cocktail because it should be the last 
one he will be having for quite a while.’

Two pistols, 60 rounds of ammunition and a machete were found in his rented villa.

His arrest was carried out by Spain’s elite anti-terrorism police on Friday.

After his capture he was taken to 
Madrid for an extradition hearing at Spain’s Central Criminal Court that
is expected to take place today.

Moran, from Salford, Greater 
Manchester, is the 50th British criminal to have been located since 
Crimestoppers launched Operation Captura – the hunt to find UK crooks 
hiding abroad.

Two years ago investigators found his co-accused, Stephen
Devalda, 29, at a hotel in Marbella, Spain.

Moran had been involved in a gang who threatened
a security guard with a gun and machete outside an ASDA supermarket in 
Colne, Lancashire. They stole £25,000

Moran escaped capture in Spain last November, when he drove up wrong 
side of motorway to flee officers. It is not known how long Moran has 
been living abroad

And with the capture of Moran, all seven men who took part in the armed robbery have now been detained.

During the robbery in Colne, 
Lancashire, security guard James Hankinson had a gun held to his back 
and a machete was wielded as £25,000 was stolen.

After Moran was placed on the most 
wanted listed, Detective Inspector Simon Cheyte said: ‘This is a very 
serious offence and we are determined to get Moran back to serve the 
time for his crime.’

Yesterday Matt Burton, head of 
investigations at the Serious Organised Crime Agency, said: ‘Moran 
thought he could evade capture by fleeing to Spain, frequently changing 
his appearance and using false identities.

'Like his partner in crime, 
Devalda, and the other armed robbers on the hit-list discovered, though,
there’s no hiding place. Soca and its partners have the capability to 
pursue criminals relentlessly and put them behind bars.’

Detective Chief Inspector Janet Hudson
added: ‘It just goes to show that we will stop at nothing to capture 
criminals wherever they are in the world.’
