At first she looks tentative, her expression baffled as she is laid on her back in the water for the first time.

But Luna the otter soon gets the hang of it, as the adorable moment the rescue animal learns to swim at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago is captured on film.

After the five-week-old pup's first attempts at paddling on her back in a swimming pool under the close watch of staff, she is given a vigorous toweling off for her troubles.

Back in the pool again Luna is soon darting around underwater like a natural, playing with a small green toy.

Finally she is filmed diving into the water of the regular otter enclosure as if she had been doing it all her life.

The young pup became an internet sensation after she was rescued and, without a name, referred to online purely as Pup 681.

Only last week was it was announced the mammal would be named Luna after the aquarium accepted submissions from the public.

The young pup was welcomed to the aquarium in early November weighing less than 3kg.
