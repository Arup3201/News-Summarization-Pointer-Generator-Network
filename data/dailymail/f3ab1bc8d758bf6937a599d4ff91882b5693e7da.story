Glamorously walking around the set with a sparkling dark top, long red dress and black heels, this is the first look at Jane Fonda's extraordinary transformation into Nancy Reagan.

The 74-year-old US actress was yesterday spotted filming The Butler in New Orleans, Louisiana, with Harry Potter star Alan Rickman playing her husband Ronald Reagan.

Fonda has undergone a dramatic makeover for the film - as has 66-year-old Londoner Rickman, who looked remarkably like the late 40th US President, with his hair dyed dark brown.

Rickman was certainly sporting a strikingly different look to play Reagan, who died in 2004, than for his most famous role as Hogwarts teacher Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films.

Fonda was done up in full hair and make-up to play the former Republican president's wife, Nancy, who is now 91. Co-star Oprah Winfrey, 58, shared a snapshot from the set on Instagram yesterday.

Fonda later posted a picture of herself alongside a dapper-looking singer Lenny Kravitz, 48, who plays a character called James Holloway in the film, directed by Lee Daniels.

The Butler tells the story of White House butler Cecil Gaines, played by Forest Whitaker, who worked for eight presidents at the iconic Washington D.C. residence over his 34 years there.

The movie has a stellar cast with a 
host of big names playing the remaining presidents. Oprah Winfrey will 
play Cecil's wife Gloria. Also cast is Robin Williams as Dwight D 
Eisenhower.

Meanwhile John 
Cusack will play Richard Nixon, James Marsden as John F Kennedy and Liev
Schreiber as Lyndon B Johnson, for the film which is due to be released
next year.

Among the First 
Ladies are Minka Kelly as Jackie Kennedy and Melissa Leo as Mamie 
Eisenhower. Other cast members include Cuba Gooding Jr, David Oyelowo, 
Terrence Howard, and Alex Pettyfer.

In
real life Fonda, a mother-of-two who was born in New York City, has 
had three divorced husbands but now lives with her boyfriend, music producer
Richard Perry, who is 70 years old.
