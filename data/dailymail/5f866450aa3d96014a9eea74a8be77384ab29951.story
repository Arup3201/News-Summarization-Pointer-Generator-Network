A drunk mocked a Muslim prayer ritual and then hurled racist abuse when dozens rioted after a Help for Heroes march turned sour, a court heard today.

Lee Cousins, 40, was among 60 men who attended a Facebook-organised rally to raise cash for the charity in memory of Lee Rigby, 25, who was murdered in Woolwich last week.

But when trouble flared and police tried to stop the parade, a mob barricaded themselves in a Bristol pub - sparking a five-hour stand-off and 19 arrests in Bristol.

Unrest: Riot police outside the St George's Pub in Bristol after a disturbance which led to several men being arrested for mocking Islam, Lee Cousins

Unsavoury: This is one of the 19 men arrested in the riot, which came on the back of a disrupted Help for Heroes march in Bristol

In the chaos Cousins came outside, got down on his hands and knees in the road and mocked a Muslim prayer ritual - also shouting racist insults about Allah.

Appearance: Jason Bennett, 39, outside Bristol Magistrates Court, where he pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour and was fined £50

Today he blamed alcohol for his actions during the march in Bristol on Saturday night.

Cousins, who represented himself said: 'I
 was very drunk and I apologise for my behaviour. I was extremely drunk -
 I apologise if I offended anyone.'

He pleaded guilty to racially or 
religiously aggravated harassment or alarm. He was fined £500 and 
ordered to pay £85 costs plus a £15 victim surcharge.

Prosecutor Siobhan Heron told Bristol Magistrates Court the event had started peacefully with around 30 people but the crowd later doubled.

She said: “When police arrived a number of people used chairs and tables to make a barricade. Police formed a line outside and bottles and glasses were thrown at them.

'The atmosphere was hostile. A group of men came out of the pub. Cousins was among them. He mocked a Muslim prayer ritual and got down on his hands and knees.'

Luke Selman, 23, of Bristol, also 
admitted using threatening words or behaviour towards two police, with 
intent to cause fear or provoke unlawful violence, and to assaulting a 
police officer and will be sentenced on June 17.

Jason Bennett, 39, of Bristol, pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour and was fined £50.

Problems: Hoards of police were forced to break up the walk in Bristol because of disorder

Trouble: Riot officers were called to halt a Bristol walk in support of Help for Heroes after they feared it would stoke up 'community tensions' - this led to 19 arrests

Andrew Carlisle, of Bridgeyate, Gloucestershire denied using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke unlawful violence and with face trial on August 22.

Another eight people were bailed to appear at court and seven more released on bail pending further inquiries.
