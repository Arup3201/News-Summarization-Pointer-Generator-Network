'She has gone through so much in her life and the one thing she wanted to accomplish is putting her handprints and footprints in the world,' Miss Vennes' letter to MAC reads.

'We should make one of Talia's dreams come true whether she is here with us today or not, because she deserves every second of it.'

Some supporters have suggested the beauty giant, who regularly launches limited-edition ranges, could donate part of the proceeds from the 'Talia line' to cancer research.

Adrienne Zazulak of Canada wrote: 'Talia is an inspiration. If my makeup purchase could help a childhood cancer charity, in her name, AND achieve one of her dreams? I'd buy that any day.'

She explained in one video: 'When I put on my make-up I feel like I can embrace those features that I really like about myself.ore than 759,110 people subscribed to her YouTube page to watch Talia's bubbly and expert tips.

Thanks to the success of her online how-tos, Talia was able to achieve two of her biggest ambitions.

She was invited on the Ellen show, where she was made an honorary CoverGirl and presented with a professional shot advert by host Ellen DeGeneres,another representative of the cosmetics brand.

Earlier this year, Talia also fulfilled her dream of becoming a fashion designer as she collaborated on a line of clothing for teenagers called That Bald Chick with Los Angeles-based designer, Urbana Chappa.

Ms Chappa, who runs a womenswear label called Maison De Urbana, got in touch with Talia after hearing her inspirational story on the Ellen show last fall.

She flew to Florida on April 15 to meet the teen at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando and help bring her design ideas to life.

Ms Chappa, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 19 but successfully overcame the disease, explained that meeting Talia was an experience 'I'll never forget.'

Barely there: Talia wasn't afraid to show the 
effects of chemotherapy, as well as how much fun make-up could be; she 
hoped her openness would help other young cancer suffers

A message posted by her mother read: 'It is with a heavy heart that we share with all of you that Talia has earned her wings at 11:22am. Please lift her beautiful soul, her beautiful light to heaven.'

Dozens of fans took to Twitter to offer their condolences including Ellen DeGeneres, Miley Cyrus, Kendall Jenner and Justin Bieber.

Talia was first diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma cancer, a tumor that develops from nerve tissue in infants and children, on Valentine's Day in 2007 when she was just seven years old.

Following chemotherapy, surgery and radiation she was cancer-free for one year but in September 2008 doctors found the disease had spread to a small lymph node near her heart.

For the next four years she received various treatments, but after periods of remission the cancer kept on returning to other parts of her body.

Messages of condolence: Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres had met the teen numerous times

Great loss: The news of Talia's death has touched thousands of her fans around the world 

Last year, on one of her famous YouTube video, she revealed that she had neuroblastoma and leukemia at the same time.

Doctors suggested a bone marrow transplant as a possible remedy but Talia decided forgo another painful surgery and enjoy her remaining days.

Last summer they estimated she had 12 months left to live.

Always looking at things in a positive light, Talia said: 'I've gotten so many benefits from [cancer].

'Having a YouTube channel, [inspiring] people and having people look up to me . . . the journey of having cancer was amazing. But every journey has an end.'
