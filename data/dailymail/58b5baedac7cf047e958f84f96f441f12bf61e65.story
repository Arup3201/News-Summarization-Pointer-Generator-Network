Former Guantanamo Bay inmate Ahmed Zuhair stopped eating in June 2005 and kept up his protest until he was sent home to Saudi Arabia in 2009

Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Ahmed Zuhair, who refused to eat for four years, has condemned the prison's 'excruciating' force-feeding methods.

The 47-year-old revealed he was tied down for hours at a time while a feeding tube was inserted into his nose so the liquid nutrient drink Ensure could be digested, causing his nose to bleed. 

But the father of ten was adamant that nothing would deter him from his four-year hunger strike.

'During each force-feeding, my nose bleeds,' Zuhair said in a sworn statement submitted to the court by his lawyer, Ramzi Kassem, a law professor
at City University of New York.

'The pain from each force-feeding is so excruciating that I am unable to
sleep at night because of the pain in my throat.'

The former sheep merchant who was 
never charged with any crime during seven years at 'Gitmo', stopped 
eating in June 2005, and kept up his protest until he was sent home to 
Saudi Arabia in 2009.

Zuhair alleges he was roughly forced into the restraint chair - what he called 'the torture chair' - and left there much longer than the two-hour maximum, even though he wasn't always confrontational. 

The
military acknowledges a 'forced cell extraction team' was repeatedly 
used to move Zuhair when he refused to walk on his own to where striking 
detainees were fed.

Zuhair says his nasal passages and back are permanently 
damaged from the way he was strapped down and fed through a nasogastric 
tube.

Court papers show
that Zuhair once racked up 80 disciplinary infractions in four months, 
refusing to be force-fed among them, and that he and fellow prisoners 
smeared themselves with their own feces for five days to keep guards at 
bay and protest rough treatment.

The one-time merchant said he has no work now, with his stomach and back in constant pain from the effects of his strike.

'My family did
not know what I was going through at Guantanamo - the humiliation, the 
torture, the solitary confinement,' he told AP.

'Not once did the thought occur to me to stop my hunger strike.

'I
think about the men who are at Guantanamo and I wonder about America's 
humanity.

'I ask myself how much longer this will go on.'

This is the restraint chair used to force-feed Guantanamo Bay inmates

The news comes amid a raft of protests against the U.S. military facility in Cuba and its controversial force-feeding processes, with about 44 detainees being fed through their nose every day to prevent them 
from starving to death.

AP reports 104 of the 166 
prisoners are hunger striking, and it's U.S. police to keep strikers alive.

Navy Capt. Robert Durand, a spokesman for the detention center, said the feeding 
procedure is considered safe and its use has been upheld by the courts.

He said the feeding tubes are lubricated and prisoners are offered anesthetics to 
prevent long-lasting damage.

'We
think there are adequate safeguards in place to make it as pain-free 
and comfortable as possible,' he said.

'It's not done to inflict pain 
and it's not done as punishment. It's done to preserve life.'

Officials
refer to the process by the medical term 'enteral feeding' rather than 'force feeding'.

It involves restraining men with straps that resemble 
airplane seatbelts to a specially designed chair that looks like a piece
of exercise equipment.

But Dr. David L. Katz, an internist on the faculty of the Yale University School of Medicine, said force-feeding hunger strikers is unethical.

He said there are risks to prolonged enteral feeding, including the possibility of getting liquid in the lungs and or damaging the nasal passages, particularly when the person is uncooperative.

'You do a procedure when it's the best choice under the circumstances,' Katz said.

'In this ethical context, these are people you are forcing to receive sustenance they don't want.

'I don't know how you begin to measure risk-benefit trade-offs, but there are some medical risks, certainly.'

The military began using the restraint chair at Guantanamo to feed prisoners in January 2006 after hunger strikers grew dangerously thin and officials feared some might die.

While the U.S. military has defended its practice to keep hunger strikers alive, medical experts say it is unethical and dangerous.
