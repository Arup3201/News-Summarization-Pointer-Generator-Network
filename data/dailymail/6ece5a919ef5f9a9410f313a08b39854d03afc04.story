Being tapped on the butt by Chad Johnson is a sign of respect, the former NFL player's lawyer has claimed.

In legal documents Adam Swickle asked the Broward County Circuit judge to reconsider her decision on Monday to jail Johnson for 30 days for disrespecting her court.

The court had erupted into laughter when Johnson tapped his lawyer on the butt moments before the judge had been due to sign a plea agreement.

'This [laughter] is not Mr Johnson's fault and he should not be punished for the actions of third parties,' Mr Swickle has argued.

Johnson, nicknamed 'Ochocinco' for his 
old football jersey number, was sentenced to 30 days in jail for a domestic
violence probation violation by Judge Kathleen McHugh.

He had previously reached a deal with
prosecutors for community service and counseling to resolve a probation
violation from his no-contest plea last year to battery on his 
then-wife, TV star Evelyn Lozada.

However, Judge McHugh decided to jail Johnson after accusing him of not taking proceedings seriously.

When she asked the 35-year-old if he was 
satisfied with his attorney, Johnson 
reportedly smacked Mr Swickle's backside.

No joke: Former NFL player Chad Johnson was sentenced to 30 days in jail when a judge refused to accept the plea deal after he slapped his lawyer's but in court. He last played an official game for the New England Patriots

'I just saw you slap your attorney on the 
backside. Is there something funny about this?' Judge McHugh said on Monday.

'The whole 
courtroom was laughing. I'm not going to accept these plea negotiations.
This isn't a joke.'

Mr Swickle said the pat was Johnson's way of showing appreciation for his attorney's work on the case.

'Mr. Johnson has been a professional 
football player in the National Football League for 11 years and patting
another individual on the backside is viewed as a sign of respect and 
gratitude,' Mr Swickle said in the motion.

'It is clear that the court misinterpreted Mr Johnson's interaction with his attorney.'

The butt pat came as Johnson believed
he would not have to go to jail, despite skipping meetings with his 
probation officer for three months.

Prosecutors said Johnson's sentencing will be left to Judge McHugh, who presides over domestic violence cases.

Johnson had tried to apologize to the judge on Monday. 'This is your courtroom. I have no 
intent to make this a joke. It's not funny,' he said. 'My life is in a 
shambles right now.'

While his future now seems a little 
uncertain, in court Johnson had expressed hopes that he might sign with 
another football team this year.

When Johnson was arrested in August, the Miami Dolphins released him and he hasn't played in the NFL since.

A court hearing has been set for Monday but until then, Johnson will remain in jail.
