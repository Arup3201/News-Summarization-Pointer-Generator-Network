The son of West Ham co-owner David Sullivan has apologised to midfielder Kevin Nolan after questioning whether he was good enough to play for the club.

Moments after Sam Allardyce's side conceded a late equaliser to Everton in their FA Cup third-round tie on Tuesday night, Dave Sullivan took a swipe at Nolan on Twitter.

Writing to more than 7,000 followers, @DaveSulley tweeted: 'Livid how sam says zarate isn't good enough to play for west ham and yet nolan is some how'.

West Ham allowed striker Mauro Zarate to join QPR on loan this week while Nolan played the full game as Allardyce's side drew 1-1 with the Toffees at Goodison Park.

Sullivan Junior returned to Twitter on Wednesday morning to issue his apology.

He wrote: 'I would like to apologise on behalf of my family and myself as I do not think I have represented them fairly by my tweets yesterday.

'They were a moment of madness as emotions got the better of me, I am only young but old enough to know better, there is no excuses for my actions. 

'I am also sorry to kevin nolan, who doesn't particularly deserve my comments. I hope everyone will forgive me and this sort of Situation will not happen again. Thank you for your understanding COYI.'

Sullivan signed off by saying that he will no longer discuss West Ham on his Twitter account and urged anyone following him for Hammers-related tweets to click the unfollow button.
