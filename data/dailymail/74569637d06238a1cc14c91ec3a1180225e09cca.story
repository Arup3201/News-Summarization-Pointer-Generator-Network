Royal Ascot has become much more than horses and royalty in recent years with fashion, in particular outlandish hats, taking centre stage.

But the Countess looked stylish and classic in her skirt and matching suit jacket, teamed with black knee length boots at the Christmas Meeting. 

Lady Louise, the only daughter of Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, and Sophie, had even coordinated her outfit for the day's events, wearing a white blouse with a horse design.

The second day of the Christmas Meeting features a two-mile £150,000 Ladbroke Handicap Hurdle, the highest profile event of its type outside the Cheltenham Festival.

Off the track, families are able to join in the festive fun at the fairground, meet Father Christmas and join in the carol singing.
