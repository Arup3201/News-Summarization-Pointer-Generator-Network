Many people have wondered why animals tend to avoid grazing on land near high voltage electricity pylons and power cables.

And now scientists believe they have solved the mystery by finding that flashing UV light that is undetectable to humans probably scares creatures including reindeer away.

Power lines give off ultraviolet light as irregular flashes at insulators and as a ‘standing corona’ - a halo of gas - along the cables that can be seen by birds and some mammals.

The subject of animals being forced to avoid cables because they are frightened is particularly controversial in Scandinavian countries because of demands that power lines should be located away from wild and semi-domesticated reindeer (pictured)

Scientists are not sure why some animals can see ultraviolet light and others can't.

It is thought that some use it to see in the dark as well as spotting potential mates or predators. Reindeer for example see UV light and it helps them spot polar bears that appear to be incredibly well camouflaged in white snow.

Bees and other insects use their UV vision to see colours and patterns on plants.

Rodents use it to follow trails of urine, but they are not sure what pets use it for.

Experts also question why human eyes filter out UV light.

Some think it could be to protect the delicate retina, but other animals that live for a long time and see UV do not have damaged eyes.

Other scientists consider that the human eye is best suited to seeing detailed images in low levels of light, whereas other creatures that see UV tend to see in less detail.

It is thought that reindeer see the UV range as the Arctic is rich in UV light and it might even help them spot polar bears.

A recent study found that around 35 species of animals, including cats and dogs, can see light that humans cannot.

Scientists from University College London (UCL), Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UIT The Arctic University of Norway and the University of Oslo in Norway investigated the phenomenon to investigate whether pylons have detrimental effects on populations of reindeer.

The mystery of mammals and birds avoiding high voltage power lines has been recognised for some time but had puzzled scientists because suspended cables are neither a barrier to wildlife nor are regularly associated with humans.

The subject of animals being forced to avoid cables is particularly controversial in Scandinavian countries because of demands that power lines should be located away from wild and semi-domesticated reindeer - the latter herded by indigenous Saami people who depend on the animals.

Populations of wild reindeer in Norway can sometimes fragment because they ‘cannot’ roam freely because of power lines, leading to the creation of 23 distinct herds in southern Norway, The Independent reported.

Professor Glen Jeffery of UCL, said: ‘New information about animal vision along with the characteristics of power lines, provides strong evidence that the avoidance may be linked with animals’ ability to detect ultraviolet flashing on power lines that humans cannot see and which they find frightening.’

By choosing to avoid power lines, animals such as reindeer face disruption of migration and substantial loss of grazing land. This can affect the growth and genetic variability of populations.  

For reindeer in particular it influences the wellbeing of herds and of herders who rely on the animals for their livelihoods, cultural identity and food, the experts said.

The effect may be more pronounced in snowy areas where the ultraviolet light is reflected and scattered by snow, they explained.

In dark Arctic winters, the team argues, power lines do not appear to reindeer merely as impassive, grey structures but rather as lines of flashing lights stretching across the terrain.

High voltage power cables can cause a build-up of ionised gas that means they have a ultraviolet glow as well as occasional bursts of light.

Power companies work hard to stop such bursts because they cause power leakage, but it is almost impossible to eliminate them.

Scientists think that the UV filter in the human eye means that we can see more accurately than without it.

British researchers found that a whole plethora of mammals, including dogs, cats, hedgehogs and ferrets can see in UV, giving them a better view at night among other benefits.

It was previously thought that only a handful of mammals could see ultraviolet light, but the new study could help scientists shed some light on why pets behave the way they do.

Ron Douglas, a biologist at City University London, in England told LiveScience: ‘Nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet, but in fact, they do.’

Light is made up of a spectrum of colours and humans can see from red to violet, whereas many animals, such as bees, fish, reptiles and amphibians can see ultraviolet wavelengths invisible to humans.

A number of mammals including bats, reindeer and some mice and moles are already known to see in ultraviolet, but scientists are not sure why some animals have it and others, as well as humans, do not.

The lens of the human eye blocks ultraviolet light, but in some animals UV can reach the retina and the light is converted into nerve signals, which travel to the brain and are processed.

To explore which animals possess the capability to see ultraviolet light, the researchers obtained eyes from a wide array of mammals that had died in zoos, vets, science labs or slaughterhouses.

They measured how much light got through each animal’s eye to the retina.

Scientists found that many of the animals, including cats, dogs, hedgehogs, ferrets and okapi, have lenses that let some ultraviolet light though, suggesting that they can see well in the dark.

Scientists already know that bees and other insects use their UV vision to see colours and patterns on plants, while rodents use it to follow trails of urine, but they are not sure what pets use it for.
