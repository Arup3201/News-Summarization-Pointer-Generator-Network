Ferrari’s first ever hybrid was launched today as the company proves that environmental technology can still provide the speed-seeking thrills of a supercar.

The new lightning-fast car called LaFerrari - or ‘The Ferrari’ – is the fastest car the company has ever built, and will have a £1million price tag.

It has an electric motor linked to a 6.3 litre petrol engine that propels it from rest to 62mph in under three seconds and to 124mph in under seven seconds.

Hybrid: LaFerrari is the company's first ever environmentally friendly hybrid car

With a top speed of 220mph, its lap time
around Ferrari’s legendary Fiorano  circuit is under 1 minute 20 
seconds -  5 seconds faster than a Ferrari Enzo and more than 3 seconds 
faster than a the F12 Berlinetta.

The company said that LaFerrari, which made its world debut at today’s Geneva International Motor Show, is the fastest car in Maranello’s history and ‘the first hybrid in Ferrari history.’

‘All in all the car guarantees maximum driving thrills,’ said a Ferrari spokesman. ‘The LaFerrari’s body has been given a sculptural treatment heavily influenced by its aerodynamics.’

Built for thrills, LaFerrari emits 330 g/km of CO2, which though low by supercar standards, is still much higher than an average hybrid car.

Striking: the car's design includes chairs that are moulded to the drivers body

fast: lap tests showed that LaFerrari is faster than the iconic Ferrari Enzo

The congestion charge exempt Toyota Prius costs £21,600 and has CO2 emissions are much lower at just 89g/km, it qualifies for exemption from the London congestion charge and does 72 miles to the gallon.

Top speed: More than 220mph

0-62mph: under 3seconds

0- 124: under 7 seconds

CO2 emissions: 330g/km

Lap time Fiorano circuit: Under 1min 20s

To save weight the seats are fixed and moulded to the individual driver following a ‘bespoke fitting’.

There are no runners. Instead it is the pedals and steering wheel which are adjustable. So if you sell the car, Ferrari will have to mould a new bespoke seat for the new owner.

The driving position is similar to that of a single-seater F1 car and was designed after consultation with the Ferrari drivers Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, who both played an active role throughout the entire development process.

Weight from the system is kept low and between the car’s two axles as close as possible to the floor to lower its centre of gravity by just over an inch to boost dynamic handling and help keep the car as compact as possible.

The chassis has four different types of carbon-fibre, all hand-laminated and cured in an oven in the racing department using the same design and production methods as the Formula 1 car.

The seats and the battery compartment were integrated into the chassis to improve the car’s rigidity and cut weight.

It is powered by Ferrari’s hybrid petrol-electric energy recovery system called ‘HY-KERS.’

The powerful 6.3 litre V12 800 horse-power engine is coupled with a 120 Kw electric motor with power equivalent to about 40 electric kettles, as much horsepower as a family saloon.

Together this gives the LaFerrari a combined power output of 963 horsepower – equivalent to nearly ten Ford Fiestas - to drive the wheels.

The electric motor is coupled with the F1 derived dual-clutch gearbox so that power is instantly available to the wheels during acceleration and from the wheels to the electric motor during recharging.

Electric: the engine is a combination of a 120kw electric motor and a 6.3litre petrol engine

Iconic: the company believe this hybrid is as thrilling as a normal supercar

A computerised engine management system controls the relative flow of petrol and electric power.

A second electric motor powers ancillaries such as air conditioning. The thin battery pack weighing 60kg covers most of the cabin under-floor area and is attached to the chassis beneath the driver and passenger to keep the centre of gravity low.

The batteries are charged in two different ways. Firstly energy generated from braking is collected.

Secondly energy is collected every time the engine produces more torque or ‘puling power’ than is needed - such as in cornering.  Instead of being sent to the wheels, the excess power is converted to energy and stored in the batteries.

An aerodynamic guide vane on the rear spoiler generates downforce to keep the car gripping the road – and prevent it taking flight.  An on board computer electronically measures the car and the driver’s actions to optimise performance.
