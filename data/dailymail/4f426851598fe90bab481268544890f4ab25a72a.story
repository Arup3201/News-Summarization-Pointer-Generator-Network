A businessman has been told to re-label his healthy ice cream because it does not contain enough fat.

Trading standards inspectors told Tim Coffey that he cannot describe his product as ice cream because its fat content is only 4.8 per cent.

Food labelling regulations state that the food must have a fat content of five per cent or higher to 
qualify as ice cream.

Mr Coffey, 40, makes his products with local milk and cream, selling the dessert at his Real Italian Ice Cream Co stores in Bath, Somerset.

The traditional Italian gelato-style technique he employs results in a higher milk to cream ratio than British processes.

The businessman, who runs two shops in Bath with wife Francessca Addabbo, 41, said he was shocked by the ruling after a trading standards inspection last week.

He said: 'It was just a normal visit making sure all weights and measures were correct and everything is fine.

'Then we had an email two days later saying the ice cream should no longer be referred to as ice cream and we need to rename it on all our price lists.

'This is basically all because it is healthy. It looks like ice cream, it tastes like ice cream, it is ice cream but we can't call it ice cream because of 0.2 per cent fat difference.

Mr Coffey said that ice cream-makers should be encouraged to reduce the fat content of their product.

He said: 'Ice cream is a product that is popular with children, you want to make the fat content lower not higher.'

The couple, who have been making ice cream since 2005, are now considering whether to rename their ice cream as gelato or change the recipe to increase its fat content.

A spokesman for Bath and North East Somerset Council confirmed Mr Coffey had been asked to relabel his product.

He said: 'Mr Coffey was advised that gelato made in the traditional manner does not have the required fat content to meet the compositional standard for ice cream.

'The council, in its drive to promote healthier lifestyles, is supportive of local businesses such as the Real Italian Ice Cream Company, offering Italian-style gelatos which contain less fat than traditional ice cream.'

He said Mr Coffey had not been told to change the name of the shop or company, but to describe the product on price boards as 'gelato'.

Gelato has a greater proportion of whole milk to cream so naturally has a lower fat percentage than British ice creams.

It is also churned at a slower speed, which makes it denser as less air is whipped into the mixture.

Ice cream is frozen but gelato is typically served at a slightly warmer temperature.
