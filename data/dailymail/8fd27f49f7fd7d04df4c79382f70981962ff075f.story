Police have admitted to 'inadvertently' re-setting Rebecca Leighton's Facebook after closing it down

A police force has admitted to ‘inadvertently’ reactivating a high-profile suspect’s Facebook account after offering to close it down to protect her privacy.

Rebecca Leighton was arrested by Greater Manchester Police on suspicion of contaminating the saline drips of several patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester.

She has claimed that officers, after getting her consent to close down her account, logged on to her profile and made it publicly accessible when it had previously been private. She also alleges that they leaked her name to the press.

The nurse, who was cleared of the allegations against her, also claims the police force hacked into her email account when she was arrested in July 2011 and is suing the force for up to £100,000.

In a High Court defence to the claims, seen by MailOnline, the police force admits officers asked for her Facebook log-in details, but denied asking for her Hotmail email details.

Greater Manchester Police admitted an officer logged on to her Facebook, with consent, and changed the password ‘in order to protect [Miss Leighton’s] privacy so as to prevent any person, who may have been in possession of [her] original Facebook username and password, from being able to reactivate said account’.

The officer then closed down the account before ‘inadvertently’ reactivating it.

Ms Leighton claims that when the account was reactivated, her Facebook privacy settings were changed meaning the account was publicly accessible.

As well as this meaning the public were able to see her photographs, Ms Leighton claims she received a number of hurtful and threatening messages.

In addition to being called a ‘disgusting little tramp’, she claims to have received messages calling for her to ‘REMAIN IN PRISON FOR THE REST OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE, FAT COW’ and ‘rot in hell’.

But the police force claimed to have been able to access a number of details on her Facebook account via a public search – including her friend list and her wall – before the account was accessed by officers.

The High Court defence does not specify whether her photographs were accessible.

The police also denied volunteering her name to the press.

Greater Manchester Police put a press release out about making the arrest - and says it was right to do so - and said that several media organisations called in throughout the day to ask for an identity.

It claimed a reporter from the Manchester Evening News successfully identified her to the press office around two hours before an officer accessed her Facebook account.

Ms Leighton spent six weeks in custody as police investigated the deaths of several patients from suspected saline drip contamination.

The police force in its defence to Ms Leighton’s claims has said she is required to prove that her Facebook account was private before July 20, 2011 and that her Hotmail was logged in to.

A police spokesman said: 'Greater Manchester Police has received a claim for damages from Rebecca Leighton.

'This matter is ongoing and as such it would not be appropriate to comment further.'
