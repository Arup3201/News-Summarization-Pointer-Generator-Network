In the last years of the 19th Century, the hamlet of Hille in Cornwall was a thriving farming community. A new chapel and schoolroom were built, along with a pretty cottage for the schoolmistress. But within 20 years, Hille and all its homes had been abandoned.

The First World War sounded the death knell for Hille – not one of its men returned after the Armistice.

For almost 50 years it lay abandoned and decaying, until one summer Sunday in 1962 it was rediscovered by Don Slaughter, an Essex businessman, and his wife Eileen.

Village for sale: Hamlet Hille in Cornwall, which was saved by the Slaughters in the 1960s and turned into a holiday village, is now for sale

‘We used to drive down from Chelmsford every weekend looking for something to buy but couldn’t find anything,’ says Don’s widow Eileen today.

‘We’d stopped at a petrol station and the man told us Hille was for sale but he said, “It’s not the sort of place for nice people like you.” ’

Their interest piqued, the couple drove down the twisting roads, took one look and agreed to pay £2,000 for the main house, schoolhouse, 15 dilapidated cottages and a range of barns and other buildings in ten acres – then set about restoring the hamlet, which they renamed Trefanny Hill.

For the past 50 years, the restored hamlet – three miles from the village of Duloe, between Looe and Liskeard in East Cornwall – has been operating as a busy tourist business, with hundreds of holidaymakers renting its cottages, swimming in its outdoor pool, playing tennis or relaxing in its very own pub, the Trefanny Inn.

But after half a century, the family is selling up. ‘My dad died five years ago and Mum’s now 86, and there are other things I want to do,’ says son Jon Slaughter, who is building his own house in the village.

Jon has already sold two two-bedroom cottages for £145,000 each, as well as St Mary Manor House, in which he was brought up, for £490,000.

And now the remaining 15 cottages and a barn with planning permission for conversion into a four-bedroom house are on the market with a price tag of £2 million. Of the cottages, seven have one bedroom, five have two, and three have three bedrooms.

All have their own gardens, and the 
price also includes the village’s tennis court, badminton court, play 
area, pool and ten acres of land, as well as three barns, which 
currently comprise the pub, laundry and games room.

‘When
Mum and Dad came here, all but two of the cottages had been condemned 
and the only house that was habitable had an outside loo, so they lived 
in a caravan while they did it up,’ says Jon.

‘Locals used to drive up here on a Sunday to see what these weird people were doing.’

Within months, the first house was ready for guests and the couple started work on the rest of the village, and along the way they discovered ancient treasures, including an 11th Century aspersorium – a vessel for holding holy water.

‘This part of Cornwall was popular 
with pirates and smugglers and they would have come through here because
the Penzance to London stagecoach used to go straight through Hille,’ 
says Jon.

The couple then 
converted a former cider barn into Trefanny Hall, which became the 
family home until they found another hidden property.

‘Mum
was out walking one day and in the undergrowth she came across a 
chapel, which they didn’t even know existed. It was owned by the Church 
of England and they bought it and converted it into their own house,’ 
explains Jon.

Today, all the houses have open fires 
or log-burning stoves, washing machines, dishwashers and microwave 
ovens, and many families return year after year, not just in summer but 
all year round.

‘We get a 
lot of people at Christmas and, in our best year, had a turnover of 
£345,000,’ says Jon, who was born three years after his parents moved to
Cornwall and has no plans to leave Trefanny.

For
the past 20 years, he has been building The Castle, a vast granite 
structure which, when finished, will have a medieval living room, 
banqueting hall, kitchen, winter parlour, one bedroom and a bathroom.

‘I’ve got planning permission for a second wing with another 20ft by 40ft bedroom and en suite and rooms below that. I’ll build it in modules and add things as I go,’ says Jon.

Estate agent Maitlands, which is handling the sale, has had a lot of interest from buyers who want to carry on running Trefanny Hill as a holiday village, but the prospective purchasers have struggled to find a bank willing to lend to them.

‘We had two families who wanted to buy it and run the business together, but getting a mortgage has been a problem,’ says Claire Biddlecombe, of Maitlands.

‘We are currently negotiating with a group of local investors who are looking to split the village and sell off the houses individually.’

While tourists, many of whom have returned to Trefanny Hill year after year, will lose out, the holiday village may be worth less than the sum of its parts, so breaking it up could make sense – and a quick profit.
