The owner of a small drone that smashed onto the White House grounds early on Monday was a federal government employee, who said he breached the secure perimeter by accident.

The unidentified man, who is from Washington D.C. and does not work at the White House, came forward hours after the pre-dawn incident triggered a major emergency response and raised fresh questions about security at the mansion. 

 A U.S. official said that the man contacted the Secret Service after reports of the crash spread across the media, and he told the agency he had been flying the drone for fun.

A federal government employee contacted the Secret Service to say he was responsible for the drone that landed on the White House South Lawn, pictured, early Monday. He said he did not intend for it to go near the White House and that he had been flying it for fun 

The Secret Service searched the North Lawn on Monday morning to see if anything else might be on the ground

The discovery was confirmed during a briefing on the president's trip to India and the Secret Service are currently investigating the device

Emergency vehicles surrounded the southeast corner of the White House during the pre-dawn incident 

In a statement released Monday, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said: 'The individual has been interviewed by Secret Service agents and been fully cooperative. 

'Initial indications are that this incident occurred as a result of recreational use of the device.

'This investigation continues as the Secret Service conducts corroborative interviews, forensic examinations and reviews all other investigative leads.'  

Florida Republican Rep. John Mica said the Secret Service wasn't taking the necessary steps to address the new security concern that drones presented. 

'You could put light explosives on a drone and they could do an incredible amount of damage not only to the White House but to the Capitol and other government facilities.

'I know there are technologies available that can disable the electronics of a drone, and that's something they should be thinking about.'

The drone was too small to be detected by the White House's radar system, the New York Times reported. 

It it designed to detect flying objects such as planes, missiles and large drones.  

The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours on Monday morning after the crash, even though President Obama and his wife were not home at the time.

A U.S. Secret Service officer on duty saw and heard the two-foot-wide commercial drone fly at a low altitude into the heavily guarded complex and crash on the southeast side at 3.08am, the agency said.

'An investigation is underway to determine the origin of this commercially available device, motive, and to identify suspects,' a Secret Service spokeswoman said in an earlier statement. 

Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, said it did not appear to pose an ongoing threat to anyone in the building.

He confirmed the discovery during a briefing on the president's trip to India and said  both of the president's daughters had been at home during the time of the incident.

The White House saw an increased security presence early this morning as emergency vehicles with lights flashing were clustered near the southeast entrance to the mansion. 

A security perimeter was set up around the White House to restrict access. 

There has been a string of security breaches at the White House in recent months.

In September, an army veteran with a knife hidden in his pants jumped the fence and made it as far into the East Room before he was tackled.

The breach led to Secret Service director Julia Pierson's resignation. 

Just 24 hours later, a college student drove up to the White House's security screening point and refused to leave, prompting his arrest. 

The White House was briefly on lockdown this August after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates.

The South Lawn of the White House on Monday morning.  Monday's incident was just one of a string of security breaches at the estate in recent months

The White House has seen a string of security breaches in recent years, with over 40 fence jumpers making it on to the estate in the past five years, including four in just the last year. 

Other incidents have included a wandering toddler, a naked man, and eager reality stars. 

October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs  and arrested by the Secret Service.

September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured.

The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation.

Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. 

And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn.

August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates.

May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. 

June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House.

November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for.
