Dylan Hartley has been cleared to make his comeback for Northampton in Saturday’s Aviva Premiership Final – meaning that, barring another injury setback, he will be able to join England in New Zealand next week.

The Saints are remaining coy about the prospect of their club captain being selected for his first appearance in two months, for the showpiece occasion at Twickenham.

The official line is that a decision about the hooker’s availability to play against Saracens won’t be made until Friday morning, but Sportsmail understands that Hartley will be included in the match-day 23.

Northampton's Hartbeat: Dylan Hartley will make his return for Northampton at Twickenham on Saturday

Return: Hartley is set to be in Northampton's squad for the Aviva Premiership Final

There is even a chance he could be pitched straight back into Northampton’s starting XV for the league decider.

After
 insisting it was still ‘touch and go’ whether his skipper – who has 
been sidelined since late March with a shoulder injury – would be 
involved, Saints director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, said: ‘If he's fit 
enough to be in the 23 and take part, the question is do you start him?

'Dylan is desperate to play. We know he is an outstanding hooker – one of
 the best around.’

When 
Hartley was omitted from his club’s line-up for the Amlin Challenge Cup 
Final last Friday, it appeared that his hopes of touring the land of his
 birth were over, amid persistent rumours that he had been all but ruled
 out weeks ago.

But a 
belated return to contact training has left him on course to fly to 
Auckland on Monday to link up with the national squad, which would be a 
major boost for head coach Stuart Lancaster, amid a front-row injury 
crisis.

‘With his 
improvement there's a very good chance he'll be fit for New Zealand,’ 
said Mallinder. ‘Stuart Lancaster has taken four hookers already, but if
 Dylan is fit to tour I don't think he'll have any hesitation taking him
 and he'll probably play.

'Stuart has said to me that if he plays for us, he's definitely on the plane.’
