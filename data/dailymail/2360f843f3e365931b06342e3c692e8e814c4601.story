Brazil forward Neymar has paid tribute to his club team-mate Lionel Messi, claiming the Argentinian star is 'the best in the world', ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo.

Messi was named World Player of the Year four times in a row between 2009 and 2012, but Ronaldo took the title in 2013.

But Neymar, who will face the diminutive forward in Saturday's Superclassico de la Americas in China, insists his Barcelona team-mate is still number one.

'Playing alongside him is a great honour, he is the best in the world,' Neymar told the press in China.

'To play against him is not very pleasant. We have to hope he does not have a good day and doesn't get the opportunity to touch the ball,' he joked.

'Seriously, we have to be careful because you have to be always alert when facing a great player like him, we cannot give him time and space to think or dribble. 

'Then he cannot do anything and we should win the game!'

Neymar said playing with Messi was a great honour and described the Argentine as 'the best in the world'

Brazilian star Neymar believes the only way to stop Messi is to deny him time and space on the ball
