With their trademark maroon berets, the soldiers from this elite regiment pride themselves on being the fittest of the fit. 

Which is why those wanting to join the British Army's Parachute Regiment have to pass one of toughest job interviews imaginable.

The  28-week training course which must be passed in order to become a Paratrooper has become famous within the forces for its sheer intensity.

Now, for the first time in 30 years, camera crews have gone inside the regiment's training camp to follows the fresh-faced recruits as they find out what it takes to earn the coveted maroon beret.

A seven-part series, due to air tomorrow, follows fresh-faced recruits as they attempt to survive the gruelling 28-week training course to earn a place in the British Army's Parachute Regiment

For the seven-part series, the cameras follow a platoon of young men from their arrival at the Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, through to their final Pass Out Parade seven months later.

When filming began there were 34 recruits - but by the end of the course, only eight of those are left to take their first step into the British Army.

The fly-on-the-wall footage, called Para Platoon: Earning the maroon beret, also includes an in-depth look at 'P Company', the famously gruelling final test which makes or breaks the strongest of recruits.

The eight tests which make up P Company include the stretcher race – in which recruits carry a metal stretcher weighing almost 180lbs over five miles – and the 60ft high aerial assault course, designed to see if the men can jump out of an airplane.   

During the episodes, the wannabe soldiers are seen physically retching as they test their physical limits. They are pushed to the point of exhaustion as they are filmed wading through knee-deep water and clambering over giant obstacles - only to be told to get up and start all over again.

More than anything, the course is the chance to 'take the civilian head off their shoulders for three and put them into a military environment'. And, if they succeed in doing that, the rewards are huge.  

In the first episode, the men are shown arriving at Catterick Garrison - where the British Army trains all its infantry recruits -  for their Parachute Regiment Assessment Course.

The PRAC is an initial three-day test to see whether or not the men have the endurance to take on the full 28-week training course.

Course commander Corporal Rob Price, who has done three tours of Afghanistan, puts the men through their paces using a series of tough physical assessments, designed to assess their fitness and determination. 

For the first time in 30 years, cameras have gone inside the training camp to document the young men from their arrival at the Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, through to their Pass Out Parade, seven months later

But - incase they ever dare start to get ahead of themselves - the men are constantly reminded how far they have to go: 'You are not paratroopers yet, gents. You are far from that,' they are told.

Explaining why the course is so tough, Corporal Price tells the camera: 'We don't go looking for these recruits. These recruits come to us. You either want to be here or you don't.

'If you don't, no problem to us, we will leave you where you are. But if you want to be here, you want to be part of the best regiment, you've got to step up to the task. 

The recruits' first day is a snapshot of what is to come. The men must complete a physical fitness assessment - including 48 sit ups and 48 press ups in two minutes - as well as a 1.5mile run in less than ten minutes. 

Some of the tough obstacles which the men have to complete include a steeplechase, dotted with tough obstacles (right) and swathes of muddy water (left)

They are also expected to complete a two-mile steeplechase - dotted with tough obstacles and swathes of muddy water - in less than 21 minutes. 

Coporal Price tells the camera that, apart from wading through deep water against the clock, the men will be ruined from the blisters they sustain by running for probably the first-time ever in chunky army boots.

And it's that event which claims the first casualty of the course, who is seen slumped against the wall, shattered and half-broken.

But the men barely have a second to get over their exhaustion, being told to 'stop feeling sorry for themselves' because it is 'the easiest event in the world'. 

The recruits are then made to do a four-mile 'leg burner' run over difficult and unforgiving terrain.

Corporal Price explains the lengths that some recruits have gone to, in a bid to ensure they pass the test.

He said: 'You have got to pour blood, sweat, tears to get up it. We have had guys that have been crawling up it, trying to get up there with their nails just to get up the top of it.

'We are not setting them up for it, we are just setting up to see if they can do it.' 

The recruits are also made to do a four-mile 'leg burner' run over difficult and unforgiving terrain, which the course commander said you have to 'pour blood, sweat, tears to get up'

The recruits are also put through the trainasium - a 60ft training assault, unique to the regiment.

Expected to run and jump at heights, the event simulates the so-called exit phase of a parachute jump.

Corporal Price explains: 'It is the event that conquers your fear of heights. You can either do it, or you can't.

'If you can't do a 60ft beam walk in the air, there is no way you will be jumping out of a Hercules C13 at 800ft. There's just no way.'  

The documentary follows the journey of some of the individuals who have embarked on the course, who come from all walks of life.

There's a 26-year-old who used to be a support worker competing side-by-side with a man who is trying his luck for the second time, after leaving the army, aged 16.

Corporal Price said there are several soldiers who comes from difficult backgrounds, who want to join the Parachute Regiment to better themselves.   

Another of the challenges involving boxing with one another - something which causes many recruits to fall at the final hurdle 

Meanwhile, Private Phil Howard explains how he gave up the chance of going to university to take a shot at the course.

He said: 'I always wanted to do it since I was tiny. I always wanted to join the army. I joined because I wanted to make a difference and to have a bit of meaning. I wanted to join the Paras because it is the elite unit.'  

And for Private Michael Coates, who worked as a support worker with those with learning difficulties, joining the Paras is a way of escaping his mundane life on 'Civvy Street'. 

He said: 'When you're on Civvy Street, you feel like you're doing nowt, not achieving nowt.

'If you want to do something remarkable with your life, because you're only living it once.' 

The Parachute Regiment is the airborne infantry element of 16 Air Assault Brigade.

It is an infantry force with expertise air-land deployments, by helicopter, airplane or parachute.

It is also trained to provide direct support to United Kingdom Special Forces, with whom it maintains close links.

The regiment was created after Winston Churchill, speaking in June 1940, called for the formation of an elite Corps of troops, of at least 5,000 parachute troops. 

A Parachute Training School was established at Ringway Airport, near Manchester. By the end of the Second World War, the regiment comprised of 17 battalions. 

The regiment wore the maroon beret and the nickname 'red devils' was bestowed by the enemy forces during fierce fighting in North Africa.

Following many famous operations during the war, the Parachute Regiment went on to serve everywhere from Palestine to Northern Ireland to the Falklands.

More recently, the regiment led in war-torn Kosovo and Sierra Leone.

The regiment is made up of 1 PARA, which forms the Special forces Support Group (SFSG); 2 PARA, which forms part of 16 Air Assault Brigade and is based in Colchester, Essex; 3 PARA and 4 PARA, the reserve parachute battalion with its headquarters in Pudsey, West Yorkshire. 

Another would-be soldier tells the cameras how he failed a selection course for the Royal Marines 'by a fingernail'. But, three years on, he has grown tired of his everyday life.

He said: 'I got sick to death of it. I want to proper money, proper mates and get a proper family about us.'

The comradeship is also something hammered home throughout the episodes.  

Corporal Price said: 'Once you are in the reg, you are in the reg for life, you will need no other family once you're in here. 

'It's hard to say, because I love my family as well and the majority of the guys will say that again, but being with the blokes - your guys, your men, your muckers - there's no feeling like it.

'If someone is in trouble, guys will bust a gut to help you.'

PARA Platoon: Earning the Maroon Beret is on Forces TV (SKY 264, Virgin 244, Freesat 652) tomorrow at 9pm.
