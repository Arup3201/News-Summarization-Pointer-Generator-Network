A Los Angeles family was rushed to emergency room this weekend after they ate a mushroom pizza they say was 'laced with marijuana.'

Grandmother Ava Farley and her grandson Clintay Jones, 10, started feeling strange after consuming several slices of mushroom pizza.

'It was a like a rush, sweating, heart beating real fast,' grandmother Ava Farley told CBS.

Ava Farley and her grandson Clintay Jones, 10, said they started feeling strange after eating some mushroom pizza this weekend

Unfortunately her 10-year-old grandson felt even worse after consuming his meal.

'I started feeling like dizzy and like crazy,' said Clintay Jones.

'He started cussing, going off, talking crazy, ran out the door butt naked,' Farley said of her grandson's behavior.

The pair had such an adverse reaction to their food that they were rushed to the LA County/ USC Medical Center.

After doctors evaluated the Farley's urine they found traces of marijuana intoxication.They questioned the boy and grandmother to see if marijuana was a drug used in their home.

'They questioned him like, ‘Have you had any of this? Did you do this? Is there anything in the house? Is this normal?’ No, all we had was pizza,' Farley said.

Farley's granddaughters also ate the pizza but they took the mushrooms off leading Farley to believe it was the mushrooms that were coated with marijuana.

CBS did not name publicly name the pizza shop but they spoke to the shop's owner, Eduardo Selbereo, who said he finds the accusations to be ludicrous.

'No, that’s incredible, because nobody smokes marijuana right here,' Selbereo said.

The pizza shop has a good health record with a 95 out of 100 from the LA County Department of Health.

Farley says she may sue the shop, regardless of their health record.

'I think that it’s a threat to the community,' the grandmother said.
