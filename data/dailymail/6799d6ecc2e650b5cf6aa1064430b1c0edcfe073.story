EU officials are off sick three times more than the average British worker, it was revealed last night.

According to official figures, European Commission officials took an average of 14.6 days off sick last year - triple the amount taken by British workers in the private sector.

One in seven staff were absent from more than 20 days.

Often sick: EU employees, shown here on strike last year, took an average of 14.6 days sick per year

In contrast, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry found British staff working in the privatesector took around five sick days a year. 

The figures also showed European officials even outstripped Britain’s civil servants and public sector staff - who took half as many days off work.

Peter Bone, a prominent Eurosceptic Conservative MP, told the Telegraph the figures were ‘disgraceful’.

He said: ‘I’m appalled at the waste of money. It is unbelievable that they are taking so much time off.

However,
 nobody in truth would notice whether they are there or not. They have 
no real job, they are just pushing bits of paper around and costing 
taxpayers billions of pounds.’

Perks: Those who work for the European Commission, led by Jose Manuel Barroso (pictured), have high pay and preferential tax arrangements

Pieter
 Cleppe, of the Open Europe think tank, said that the levels of illness 
among European commission staff was ‘surprising’ given their higher pay 
and perks.

He said: ‘That 
EU officials are off sick so often is surprising, especially when they 
are paid more, taxed less and tend to have better conditions than either
 civil servants in member states or people working in the private 
sector.‘

EU staff - 14.6 sick days per year

UK workers (private sector) - 4.9 days

UK workers (public sector) - 6.9 days

German workers - 19.3 days

European average - 7.3 days

Between 3.5 and 3.7 per cent of working days were lost to sickness overall.

But the commission said this was a figure in line with other European countries.

The average European worker takes 7.3 days off work each year, according to figures compiled this year by PwC - precisely half the figure for EU staff.

Only Germany, out of the Western European countries, appears to have a substantially worse sickness absence problem than EU officialdom, with officials taking an average of 19.3 days off sick last year.

According to British figures, EU officials are well paid, with 16 per cent of administrative staff at the commission earning more than £84,000 a year.

These are paid at low ‘community’ tax rates of around 20 per cent.

On top of high wages, staff receive annual holidays of 24 days as well as seven days off for public holidays and, this year, eight ‘non-working’ days out of the office when the Brussels institutions are closed in summer and at Christmas.

Many commission staff are also eligible for a ‘flexitime’ scheme that gives an extra 24 days off work every year for those that put in an extra 45 minutes a day in the office.
