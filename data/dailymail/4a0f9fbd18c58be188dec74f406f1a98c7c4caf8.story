Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists Inter Milan have not made a serious bid for Lukas Podolski, whilst maintaining he wants the forward to stay.

The Serie A club are trying to land the Germany forward next month, but Wenger - who revealed Danny Welbeck is a doubt for the Gunners' clash against Southampton with a thigh injury - says their interest is laughable.

Podolski is open to leaving but Wenger said: 'I want and hope he stays.

'That is a joke. Inter Milan is not serious. They talk, there is only talk.'

Podolski is yet to start a Premier League match for Arsenal so far this season.

The 29-year-old has netted three Champions League goals this term, with the 2014 World Cup winner firing a double in Arsenal's 4-1 win against Galatasaray.

He also scored a crucial winner away at Anderlecht, which dug the Gunners out of a hole.

Wenger would like him to stay at the Emirates Stadium and rejected the idea that he would benefit from a loan spell away.

'Podolski is a player of Arsenal Football Club and I want him to stay,' said the Arsenal boss. 

'Apart from that, what it is to be professional is that as long as you are somewhere, you give your best to justify your wages and your love for the club.

'I hope so (that he will still be here at the end of January), yes.

'I don't really doubt in some positions (situations) where players need experience (they should go out on loan), but that is not the case for Podolski.

'For players who need practice because they are at a very young age, like Yaya Sanogo it is not impossible.'

Podolski has scored 31 times in his 82 matches as an Arsenal player - but he has been a substitute for 27 of those appearances.
