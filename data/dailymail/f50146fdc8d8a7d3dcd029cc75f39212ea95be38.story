An American pastor from Idaho who was sentenced to eight years in one of Iran's harshest prisons for preaching Christianity in Iranian homes had his appeal to reduce the sentence rejected on Sunday.

Saeed Abedini, a U.S. citizen who was born in Iran, has been held since September 2012 and was charged with 'threatening the national security of Iran'.

The 33-year-old father-of-two says he was in the country only to establish an orphanage and was not preaching Christianity.

Jailed: Pastor Saeed Abedini was sentenced to eight years in prison on charges that he preached Christianity in the Islamic nation. His attempt to appeal the sentence was rejected today by Iran

Family man: Mr Abedini, seen here with his wife Naghmeh and their two young children, has a home in Idaho and is a U.S. citizen

The pastor's attorney was not given a copy of the ruling handed down by two judges.

Pastor Saeed’s wife Naghmeh told ACLJ.org that the ruling was 'devastating'.

She added her disappointment at the lack of intervention by the American government on her husband's case.

Mrs Saeed said today: 'As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic speech defending freedom by Dr. Martin Luther King, a brave American who gave his life to fight for the freedom that is so fundamental to our way of life, I am extremely disappointed that President Obama has chosen to remain silent on this critical human and religious rights case of an American imprisoned in Iran.'

The American Center for Law and Justice, which is working with Mr Abedini's family to free him from Iranian 
custody, says that the country has shown 'utter disregard' for the pastor's human rights.

The organization said that they are exploring all options to further the married father's bid for freedom.

Campaign: The American Center for Law and Justice, a legal advocacy group founded by televangelist Pat Robertson, has been working on Mr Abedini's behalf

It says the pastor led house churches in the Islamic nation in the
early 2000s, when the state did not consider such activities a threat.

Mr Abedini is being held in Evin Prison in Tehran, the notorious gulag that houses most of the country's political prisoners.

He has suffered internal bleeding and fainting episodes after being beaten by prison guards. He is also threatened by radicals because he is a Christian.

In January, the ACLJ, a legal advocacy group founded by televangelist Pat Robertson, reports that Revolutionary Court Judge Pir-Abassi convicted and sentenced Mr Abedini after a hastily-called court hearing. 

The group says that the ruling violated Iran's judicial rules and was motivated purely by politics.

'We
know that with the Iranian Revolutionary Court, Pastor Saeed’s 
conviction and sentence had to be approved at the very top – The Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Khamenei had to sign off,' Jordan Sekulow, the 
director of international operations, wrote. 

The pastor and his attorney were allowed to attend just one day of his trial, which began on January 21.

Notorious: The Evin prison outside of Tehran is where the pastor is being held and beaten by guards

Aid work: Mr Abedini argues that he was in Iran only to establish an orphanage and was not working to convert Muslims to Christianity

Political: The ACLJ says the conviction violates Iran's own justice system and appears to be manipulated by politics
