She's normally known for her combative interviewing style, but BBC radio presenter Shelagh Fogarty was left shrieking in fear when a surprise studio guest made an appearance yesterday.

BBC 5 Live lunchtime presenter Miss Fogarty started screaming and leapt on her chair live on air after a guest spotted a mouse running around the studio.

The 47-year-old was interviewing Mike Linnell from drugs charity Lifeline Project live on air at the BBC's Salford studio just before 1pm when her guest spotted the unwelcome rodent.

Surprise guest: The presenter was visibly shocked when the mouse made an appearance in the studio shortly before 1pm yesterday

Horror: Miss Fogarty leapt up in horror and kneeled on her chair

Startled: Studio guest Mike Linnell clutched his chest as he saw the mouse prompting presenter Shelagh Fogarty to think that he had been taken ill

Amused: Mr Linnell was initially shocked at the sight of the mouse but was later amused at Miss Fogarty's reaction

She screamed: 'Don't tell me you can see it, please stop, just get it out of here, oh god, oh, I don't want to carry on doing this programme, please someone get rid of the mouse.'

The brazen mouse was clearly not as afraid of Miss Fogarty as she was of it as it ran onto the desk and across her hand.

The usually calm and composed presenter became upset and changed studio following the incident.

Mr Linnell told her that he had seen the rodent when he faltered as he answered a question and she asked if there was something wrong.

'Oh my god, oh, oh how horrible,' screamed Miss Fogarty. 'Oh gosh sorry I'm live on the radio squealing and kneeling on my chair because there's a mouse in the room.

'I thought you were unwell. I'm going to leave it there because I am not sure I can continue interviewing in a a serious manner when I know there is a mouse scurrying around my feet.'

Shock: Miss Fogarty expressed her embarrassment at having screamed on air and briefly regained her composure before squealing in fear again

Drama: Workers looked around the studio for the mouse but were unable to find it, prompting Miss Fogarty to move studios

Miss Fogarty appeared to regain her composure, telling listeners: 'I'm just about OK, but these feet aren't touching the ground, I've got big boots on as well, there's no way this mouse could do me harm, it's quite ridiculous.'

She started screaming again moments later when the mouse was spotted again, begging others in the studio to get rid of the animal.

She said: 'If it walks on my hand I'm resigning. It's on the bloody table.'

Miss Fogarty was then forced to move studio in the middle of her programme after the mouse walked over her hand off air.

At the end of her show, she told BBC 5 Live colleague Richard Bacon: ‘I was in the other studio as normal earlier on and at two minutes to one, one of my guests just went “huh” and clutched his chest, I thought “oh my god, he’s having a heart attack”, and I said “are you OK?”, and he said, “I’ve just seen a mouse” and pointed to the little holes in the desk from where various wires come, and there was a little mouse sitting in there.

'I squealed and put my feet up on the chair as I did not want them on the floor.

'But the floor was not the issue and the mouse was then on the table and came across my hand. It was just horrible.’

She added: ‘I’m off to breathe deeply and recover from the mouse incident, eugh.’

Hours
after the incident, staff had still been unable to capture the mouse. 
Newsreader Rachel Hodges told listeners: ‘He could be anywhere. Someone 
was trying to catch him in a coffee cup with a lid but failed. The mouse
is on the loose.’

The mouse was spotted in the Corporation's new multi-million pound home which only opened its doors back in 2011.

Miss Fogarty is not the first BBC presenter to be startled by a mouse live on air.

Just
last month BBC Three Counties weather girl Kate Kinsella was reading 
out a bulletin on the Iain Lee breakfast show when she spotted a rodent 
in the studio.

She said: 'We could be seeing gale force winds from time to time during the afternoon.

'The good news is it will start to... AHH. Sorry there's a mouse just run past me in my studio.'

The BBC's relocation to Salford has been the subject of widespread criticism, with high-ranking members of staff questioning the need for the huge expenditure on the move.

The luxurious new base at Salford Quays, which houses programmes such as Blue Peter and Match of the Day, cost £200 million, with huge amounts of extra expenditure on staff relocation and transport between Manchester and London.

The Director General of BBC North Peter Salmon has still not purchased a home in the north, despite claiming that he would relocate close to the Salford base in 2010, it was revealed yesterday.

Ridiculous: Following the ordeal, Miss Fogarty told listeners that her reaction was 'ridiculous' as here's no way this mouse could do me harm'

Asked at a conference whether he had 
purchased a home in the region, he said: ‘I don’t think it is about 
whether people buy. It is about your commitment. My intention is still 
to buy up there.’

Salmon has previously defended staff 
who have come under fire for living in London and working at the Media 
City site in Salford, such as Radio Five Live’s Victoria Derbyshire, 
after it emerged that during some periods just 60 per cent of her shows 
were broadcast from the North.

Around 850 BBC staff have been given a
total of £11 million to cover the costs of moving, as well as one-off 
payouts worth 10 per cent of their salary, to encourage them to move 
north from London.

Another 1,000 people will move to the £180m HQ in the future, sending costs spiralling even further, according to reports.
