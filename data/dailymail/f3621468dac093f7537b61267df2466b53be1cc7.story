Hundreds of mourners attended ex-EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie’s funeral today - eight months after her dismembered torso was found in a north London canal.

Miss McCluskie, 29, who played Kerry Skinner in the BBC soap in 2001, went missing on March 1, and her torso was found by police divers scouring the Regent’s Canal near trendy Broadway Market five days later.

Two weeks after that an arm and two legs were recovered from the same stretch of water and her severed head was discovered more than six months later on September 9.

Miss McCluskie's
 brother Tony McCluskie, 35, who shared a house with her in Bethnal Green,

He was remanded in custody at the Old Bailey last month and his trial is due to take place on January 14.

The young woman's wicker coffin lay inside a glass carriage drawn by two black horses and adorned with black feathers.

It was decorated with floral tributes including 'daughter’ and ‘sister’ spelled out in white carnations and pink roses.

About
 300 people, but no stars from the EastEnders cast, attended the funeral
 at St Monica’s Catholic church in Hoxton Square, east London - some 
dressed in black and others wearing skyscraper heels.

Many
 struggled to control their tears as the carriage pulled up and Miss 
McCluskie’s distraught brother, Danny, sobbed as he helped carry her 
coffin into the church. Her father, Tony, held a single red rose.

Church bells tolled as the priest 
blessed her coffin, before the hundreds of friends and family piled in 
for the hour-long service.

Mourners sang Amazing Grace and Ave Maria and listened to a reading by Miss McCluskie’s father and friend Carly.

Floral tributes on top of the cortege contained heartfelt tributes for the actress.

A note on a bouquet of yellow and white flowers read: 'Heaven has gained the funniest angel.

TV career: Miss McCluskie playing Kerry Skinner with Dean Gaffney as Robbie in a scene of EastEnders in 2000

'I’m sure you will have everyone in hysterics up there.'

Another said: 'Rest in peace Gemma. 
True and honest is what you were. Fond memories shared will stay with me
 forever. Gone but never forgotten.'

One friend said: 'It was a very nice, fitting service. She was a good friend and really will be missed by everyone.'

As the horse-drawn carriage pulled away, friends and family had a minute’s silence before following it on foot to Gemma’s home in Bethnal Green.
