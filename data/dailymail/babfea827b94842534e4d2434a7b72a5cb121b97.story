A horsewoman today described how she was left 'absolutely terrified' after being shot outside her country home.

Louise Leggatt sustained a single 
gunshot wound after being shot by a gunman hidden in bushes as she went to check her horses.

It is alleged the gunman was her spurned
former boyfriend, huntsman Brian Fraser whose bid to rekindle their romance she 
had recently rejected.

The shooting, at about 9.30pm last March,  happened two months after arsonists attacked her home, forcing her to rent another property next door to where the shooting happened in the Kent village of Benenden.

At Maidstone Crown Court, Mrs Leggatt - who worked in a veterinary surgery - fought back tears as she recalled how a gunman opened fire.

She said: 'Every evening before I go to bed, I always check my horses to give them some hay and make sure that they are all right. I always go to see the horses between 9 and 10 at night.

'The patio door was locked. Since the fire I had become quite concerned about who was about so I always had the door locked.

'I initially unlocked the door to let my dog out, then closed the door, went back into the house and put my wellies and coat on.

'I then went to go outside. I opened the door and stepped outside to see that my dog was in the corner of the garden, very upset, very angry and barking, not like he normally is with a rabbit or a fox.

Shooting: Ms Leggatt was shot as she went to tend to her horses at Apple Pie Farm in Benenden, Kent, on March 15 last year, it has been alleged

'He was very angry, as if there was something there that he didn’t like. I could see where he was. I had a torch in my hand and I shone the torch to where he was in the corner.'

Ms Leggatt went on: 'I didn’t get very far on to the patio and, as I shone the torch across the garden and shut the patio door at the same time, I was shot.'

Ms Leggatt, a mother of two, said she could not see anyone. She said: 'First of all, I heard the sound and then I had a horrendous pain in my leg and hip, and I realised what had happened.'

Her experience of going on shoots and of her sons’ involvement with clay pigeon shooting led her to believe she had been targeted with a shotgun.

She went on to describe the frantic moments that followed as she crawled back into the house through the partly-opened patio door to try to raise the alarm.

'I pulled the door to but I didn’t manage to lock it. I was just desperate to get to a phone,' she said.

'My mobile phone had been hit because it was in my pocket so I crawled across the dining room where the house phone was and I managed to get the phone and dial 999.'

Split: Mrs Leggatt finalised a divorce from her husband Philip Gorringe, pictured, in 2007

Describing the thoughts running through her head at the time, she told the jury: 'I was absolutely terrified. I had never been so terrified in all my life.

'I was really really scared that whoever had done it was going to come back in and I couldn’t get back to lock the door.'

Prosecutors allege that Fraser, 63, 
who was a master of the Ashford Valley Hunt, tried to kill Mrs Leggatt 
'in a fit of pique' after she rejected his wishes for them to revive 
their relationship.

Fraser, of Shadoxhurst, 
near Ashford, denies attempted murder but has admitted possessing a 
firearm without a licence between March 14 and 17 last year.

Mrs Leggatt said it 'seemed like 
forever' for paramedics to arrive as an emergency operator told her a 
firearms unit would have to be deployed first.

'I
was aware that my leg was bleeding very badly and there was a lady on 
the end of the line who was very, very kind,' she told jurors.

'She said that a firearms unit had to come and the paramedics couldn’t come until the firearms unit had arrived. I was just so scared.'

She was stretchered to an ambulance and taken to Pembury Hospital in Tunbridge Wells but still felt her attacker might try to reach her again.

Mrs Leggatt said the wounds have healed but she has a large scar on her stomach where she was operated on and scarring on her leg.

Some shotgun pellets remain in her leg, causing her 'shooting pain' as they sit by her sciatic nerve. She also said she has suffered a loss of feeling below her knee.

She told how she met Fraser socially through hunting circles in the early 2000s.

Mrs Leggatt, who finalised a divorce from her husband Philip Gorringe in 2007, moved in with Fraser.She explained that over time their relationship hit difficulties. She said: 'He spent a lot of time at his farm, an unreasonable amount of time.

'We spent very little time at weekends, he always seemed to have something else on or something more important to do. We just spent no time together and our relationship just died.'

There were also disagreements between the couple, about finances in particular.

Relationship: Fraser and Ms Leggatt (above) met through the Ashford Valley Hunt, in Kent, in 2006 but split in October 2011 when he went back to live with his wife

'By 2011 we ended up sleeping in separate rooms after our relationship really came to an end.'

Fraser left Mrs Leggatt’s home in November 2011, telling her that he was moving in with an older couple who had difficulties looking after their sheep.

After a couple of weeks, Fraser started telephoning her, asking her to meet him. She said: 'I was quite upset that the relationship had deteriorated.

'But by the time he had moved out, I was relieved he had gone because his behaviour had become quite strange. His behaviour frightened me on a few occasions.'

Asked by prosecutor Ian Acheson to give examples of his 'strange' behaviour, Mrs Leggatt said he had become 'very, very secretive'.

She said: 'I knew that a lot of what he told me were lies and he never would tell me who he had been with or what he was doing.

'I could never contact him. His phone was always off. We never talked about anything.'

Mrs Leggatt said Fraser had a 'foul temper'.

She said: 'On a couple of occasion he did hurt me. He had such a foul temper that it could be sparked off by nothing in particular, and then it was as if it never happened.'

Despite attempts by Fraser to woo her back with regular phone calls and text messages, Mrs Leggatt said she resisted renewing their relationship.

'I said "no", we can remains friends but that is all,' she said.

Describing his reaction to the arson attack on her home two months before the shooting, she said she was surprised that he did not give her emotional support.

She said: 'I was surprised that, given the circumstances - that I had lost the house and its contents - I was surprised at his detachment.

'He didn’t really offer me the support that I thought perhaps he would have done, emotionally anyway.'

On Valentine’s Day, he bought her a large bunch of flowers, something she described as 'very unusual'.

'Things like Valentine’s Day, birthdays and Christmases didn’t mean a huge amount to him,' she said.

He kept trying to maintain contact with her. Mrs Leggatt said: 'He knew where I was and what I was doing a bit too much.'

The trial continues.
