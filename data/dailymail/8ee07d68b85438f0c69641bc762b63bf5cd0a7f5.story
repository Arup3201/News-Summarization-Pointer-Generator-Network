New Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao has claimed that he could have been a professional baseball player had his career in football failed.

The 28-year-old recalled how he would cry whilst playing football but became determined to thrive in baseball after being ridiculed by teammates for dropping a ball. 

'Playing football was my passion - but let me tell you I could also have been a baseball player in Venezuela, where I lived for five years,' Falcao told the Sunday People.

'I was a pitcher and I reckon that I could have had a career there.'

'But my dad realised that I was really good at playing football so we left Venezuela and I quit baseball. I believe I was designed to be a footballer.' 

The Colombian made a name for himself in Europe after joining Porto from River Plate for £3.2million in 2009. 

Having scored 62 goals in two seasons for the Portuguese club, Falcao moved to Athletico Madrid for £32m.

The striker continued his impressive goal-scoring form in La Liga, netting 52 times in 67 games, which lead to big-spending Monaco forking out £52m for him last summer.
