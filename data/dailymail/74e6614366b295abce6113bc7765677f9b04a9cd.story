The penthouse apartment owned by disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile has been sold for the second time since he died there in 2011.

The fifth-floor property, which he lived in for more than 30 years, was bought for £300,000, despite its poor state and the fact some of Savile's garish 1970s features remain inside.

It was bought for £250,000 a year ago, but the owners expected the property, which has impressive  views of Roundhay Park, to fetch £325,000.

Lair: The property was bought by Savile in the 1970s. He died there on October 11, 2011, aged 84

Cut-price: His lair was snapped up for £300,000 - £25,000 below what the previous owners wanted

The description of the property says it is not 'for the faint-hearted or DIY enthusiast' and needed a 'complete development'.

The description on property website Rightmove says: 'Enjoying outstanding panoramic views over Roundhay Park and Waterloo Lake, all the way round to Soldiers Field is a fifth floor penthouse apartment which requires complete redevelopment, yet offers scope and potential for discerning buyers to create what could be a unique and enviable home.

'The apartment has lift access via a private code and the lift opens directly into the apartment's hallway.

'The current accommodation has windows to three elevations providing panoramic views with a wrap-around balcony which includes terrace areas to both the front and rear elevations.  

'There is a large split level living room, kitchen, master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, two further bedrooms and an en-suite shower room. There is a double garage with electric door, situated in the underground garage.'

The flat formed part of the extensive investigation into Savile's sordid past. West Yorkshire Police probed his hosting of 'breakfast clubs', where officers would visit his flat for coffee and cake.

Malcolm and Angela Statman, Savile's neighbours, intended to knock down the property when they bought it over a year ago for £250,000, according to The Sunday Mirror.

They said it was in a 'terrible condition', but opted against the renovation and instead decided to sell, making a £50,000 profit.

Land registry documents show a couple are the new owners of the penthouse.

Balcony: The three-bedroom flat is three miles from Leeds city centre and has views of Roundhay Park

Decor: The gaudy pink and black kitchen in Savile's former apartment. It did not have an oven or hob as Savile preferred to eat out

Changes: The apartment requires extensive refurbishment. This room, with its blue shagpile carpet, still holds exercise equipment and posters from Savile's wrestling days

They confirmed they knew the disgraced DJ had previously owned it but would not comment on why they purchased the property.

The flat was bought by Savile in the 1970s. He died there on October 11, 2011, aged 84.

It can only be accessed through a private lift with a pass code. A pine-panelled hallway leads to a large lounge with a stained blue shagpile carpet. The kitchen is covered in pink tiles and has no cooker as the former DJ usually chose to eat out.

In the master bedroom, the wallpaper is peeling and damp patches cover the walls. However there is an en-suite bathroom.

Past: The 1970s-style bathtub is pictured with a Jim'll Fix It badge wrapped round a tap

Security: A private lift for the sole use of visitors to the penthouse opens up on to a hallway that looks straight out of the 1970s

Time warp: The bathroom in Savile's Roundhay apartment shows a grubby-looking shower tray in the same room as an old-fashioned avocado toilet and bath tub

In September 2012 
allegations that Savile had sexually abused under-age girls and boys, and adults, became widely reported.

Thirteen
 police forces were involved with the enquiries while other probes were 
launched into practices at the BBC and within the National Health 
Service.

Savile was described as one of 
Britain's most prolific ever sex offenders after Scotland Yard revealed 
last year that it was investigating complaints made by around 300 
victims.

Residence: The apartment block is hidden from the road by a line of trees, but has spectacular views of the city and a park on the other side
