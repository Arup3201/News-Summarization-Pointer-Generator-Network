She is not even old enough to vote, can’t drive and only left school last year.

But Paris Brown, who turns 17 today, is to be paid £15,000 a year to be the country’s first youth police and crime commissioner.

She has been appointed to the new post to represent young people’s views on policing in Kent.

As well as her salary, Paris will be given a desk, a telephone and official car – with her own emblem. She will work a 37-hour week.

She was appointed by Ann Barnes, who was elected to the £85,000 role of Kent Police and Crime Commissioner last year.

PCCs were elected in 41 police forces in England and Wales in November and each one has control over the budget and policing priorities in their area.

Ministers say they will make the police more accountable but critics claim they are a waste of money and could undermine the police’s political independence.

A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s always great to see people getting involved in the fight against crime in their communities.

‘But paying this youth PCC a salary and giving her expenses like this is a ridiculous waste of money and nothing more than expensive tokenism.’

And Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, said: ‘If the elected police and crime commissioner can’t do her job of protecting young people and she has to pay a 17-year-old £15,000 a year, I hope it is coming out of her own salary,

‘If she’s incapable of going out and speaking to young people herself then that doesn’t say a great deal about her.’

Miss Brown, who left school last year with six GCSEs, beat off competition from more than 160 other applicants to secure the role. She has now put on hold plans to do A-levels to take up the year-long post.

She applied for the job while working as an apprentice for her local council and living at home on the Isle of Sheppey with her parents and three brothers.

Last night she said the job would help her be the ‘messenger’ for young people in Kent.

And she has vowed to change perceptions of young people to show that most of them are ‘lovely’ and not threatening hoodies.

She said: ‘The only reason young people hang around on the street is because there’s nothing else for them to do.

‘I’m going to be going out and asking them what things they need to get them off the streets. One of the things I want to do is help to remove the stigma young people have attached to them.

‘When people see a young person in a hoodie they think they’ve got to stay away from them – but actually most young people are lovely if you give them the time.’

She added: ‘I’m just like any other girl my age. I like doing normal teenage stuff like going to the cinema with friends and playing on the computer.

‘I’m really excited. I know I’m only 16, but I really do think I can make a difference.'

Paris, from Sheerness, Kent, was one of 164 applicants for the job

Miss Brown, who is currently an apprentice official at Swale Borough Council, will take up the commissioner role in the summer.

She is working in the commissioning and open spaces department on a project to create a skate park in the town of Sittingbourne.

Despite her new job, she said she has no aspirations to become a politician and wants to go to university to study computing.

She said her mum Debra, 51, who works as a GP surgery receptionist, and dad Dennis, 51, who is a charity fundraiser, were her inspiration.

Mrs Brown said: ‘We think she’s going to do a great job. Paris has always been very confident and happy to speak her mind.

‘She’s always been one to look out for the underdog. At school she would always stand up for someone she thought was being picked on or getting a hard time.

‘She’s had a very stable, normal upbringing. She’s never been in trouble and neither have her three brothers thank goodness.

'We’ve taught them wrong from right.’

Mrs Barnes is using £5,000 from her own salary to pay the cost of the post, with the remaining £10,000 coming from her staffing budget.

She said: ‘Young people don’t have much of a voice in policing in Kent and I’m determined to change that.

‘Young people are victims of crime and also perpetrators of crime. They are often forgotten or demonised and that shouldn’t be the case – they are our young citizens and we need to listen to them.

‘Paris is going to be the young face of policing in the county and I’m quite sure she is going to do a brilliant job at helping the police to connect with young people. She’s very exceptional.’

Mrs Barnes said commissioners in other parts of the country had suggested they may introduce similar posts.
