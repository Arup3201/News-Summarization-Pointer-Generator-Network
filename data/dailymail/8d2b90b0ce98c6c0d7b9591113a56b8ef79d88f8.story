Newcastle United defender Daryl Janmaat is refusing to write off the club's season.

The Magpies slipped into the bottom half of the Barclays Premier League table as a result of Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Southampton, their seventh in nine games in all competitions.

The club's ongoing search for a head coach following Alan Pardew's departure to Crystal Palace earlier this month has created further uncertainty.

However, 25-year-old Janmaat, who along with his team-mates is currently on a warm weather training camp in Dubai, is confident the impending return from injury of the likes of Siem de Jong, Rolando Aarons and Gabriel Obertan can help to rekindle the campaign.

The Holland international said: 'We have to try to reach as high as possible. For certain, we are looking to finish in the top half of the table. That's our main aim now.

'We have Siem to come back and other good players. It's nice to know. They can make us stronger.'

De Jong, the man Pardew hoped would provide the link between midfield and attack, has managed only three starts for the club since his £6 million summer switch from Ajax.

The 25-year-old has spent the last four and a half months fighting his way back from a torn thigh muscle and while he still has some way to go, he travelled to Dubai with the rest of the squad after resuming full training last week.

De Jong could prove a key figure as Newcastle attempt to increase their goal-threat with youngster Ayoze Perez currently carrying a heavy burden as a lone striker with Papiss Cisse away with Senegal and Emmanuel Riviere yet to open his league account.
