Blanket driving bans were lifted and New York public transport was to reopen on Tuesday after the several feet of snow promised for the city failed to materialize.   

The 'historic storm' which Mayor Bill de Blasio had threatened fortunately skipped over most of New York and by 7am there was, at most, about 10 inches of snow in the city.

Mayor de Blasio was defiant and unapologetic this morning, saying that forecasts across the board has predicted 2 feet of snow, adding: 'We did what was necessary to keep everyone safe...This is a better safe than sorry scenario.'

A blizzard warning was lifted on Tuesday morning but a winter storm warning remained in place. The National Weather Service said the city could see another 1 to 3 inches on Tuesday with winds up to 40 mph.  Snowfall was expected to slow in the city by midday.

Schools, public offices and many businesses were closed on Tuesday after the Metropolitan Transport Agency (MTA) made the historic decision to shut down the transport network at 11pm on Monday night. 

Subway trains and buses were beginning service from 9am on Tuesday - by midday it would be operating a Sunday service (about 60 per cent of the full service). The Staten Island Ferry service had also resumed.

New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo said a travel ban imposed in 13 counties at 11pm on Monday would be lifted at 8am. The travel ban was also lifted in New Jersey.

The travel ban for Suffolk County in eastern Long Island remained in effect, because it had been much harder hit with up to 16 inches of snow.

Governor Cuomo told CNN: 'The plows have been working, salt trucks have been working, but it is not to be taken lightly. We're not saying that you should go out unless you really need to go out.

'And there will be delays on the roads. But we think we can lift the travel ban in coordination with our neighboring states. And we'll start to bring the public transportation system back online.' 

Cuomo said many areas had received two feet of snow and that Long Island had been particularly affected, but added that New York city had experienced less damage.

Measures were put in place in preparation for what Mayor de Blasio had described as 'a storm like we have never seen before' - but as the night passed, the huge blizzard did not materialize.
