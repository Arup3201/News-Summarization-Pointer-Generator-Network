President Obama may have had a tough couple of weeks, but newly-released images will remind him of his more carefree days.

A high school friend has shared photographs of Obama at his prom night with TIME magazine - as well as a very friendly note he penned in her yearbook, in which he calls her 'sweet and foxy'.

The images from 1979 show a grinning 17-year-old Obama in a white suit
 with his arm around his date, Megan Hughes, before they headed to the party at Punahou
 School in Honolulu, Hawaii.

They were joined by two other teenagers - his best friend Greg Orme and date Kelli McCormack.

McCormack - now Kelli Allman - told TIME that the group sipped champagne before enjoying an evening of photos, dinner and dancing.

'It was a really fun, happy time,' she said. 'We were all cracking up, and everyone was smiling.'

She also shared a complimentary note that Obama had written in her high school yearbook.

'You are extremely sweet and foxy, I 
don't know why Greg would want to spend any time with me at all!' Obama 
wrote in the lengthy yearbook note. 'You really deserve better than clowns like us; you even laugh at
 my jokes! I hope we can keep in touch this summer, even though Greg 
will be gone.'

He then wrote down his number, encouraging Allman to give him a call, and signed off 'Barry Obama'.

While Obama's prom photographs have never been seen before, details have previously emerged about his high school years.

Last year, a book delved into his teenage years and claimed that Obama and his friends formed The Choom Gang - slang for smoking marijuana - in which he invented inhaling techniques and rode a car called the Choomwagon.

With his friends, he would drive the Choomwagon, a Volkswagen microbus, to Mount Tantalus, biographer David Maraniss wrote.

Once parked, they 'turned up their 
stereos playing Aerosmith, Blue Oyster Cult and Stevie Wonder, lit up 
some ‘sweet-sticky Hawaiian buds’ and washed it down with ‘green bottled
 beer’ (the Choom Gang preferred Heineken, Becks, and St. Pauli Girl).'

Obama
 was also known on campus for his basketball skills, and was sometimes 
called 'Barry O'bomber' for his jump shot. Coaches have recalled how he 
never went anywhere without a ball.

After
 high school graduation Obama went to Columbia University and then 
Harvard Law School, where he met his future wife, Michelle.

The photos and interviews are in the new issue of TIME, which is out on Friday.

After Obama's prom date with Megan Hughes and before settling down with Michelle during his time studying at Harvard, President Obama seriously dated two women:

Alex McNear

Alex McNear was a 20-year-old literature lover he met at Occidental College in 1981 before he transferred to Columbia in his junior year.

They got back in touch when she visited New York in 1982, before continuing a long-distance relationship that eventually fizzled out, according to his biographer David Maraniss.

After their relationship, she went on to marry a Serbian Boxer named Bob Bozic who once tried to rob $60,000 from a bank. They divorced after seven years of marriage and have a daughter.

Genevieve Cook and Obama

Genevieve Cook, an elementary school teacher, and Obama met at a Christmas party in the East Village in 1983.

Cook, who was 25, and Obama, then 22, dated for 18 months, passing their time discussing books and cooking.

'The sexual warmth is definitely there,' Cook wrote in her journal. 'But the rest of it has sharp edges

'Tho he speaks sweet words and can be open and trusting, there is also that coolness - and I begin to have an inkling of some things about him that could get to me.'

When she told him she loved him, he responded with 'thank you', according to Maraniss, and they broke up in May 1985.

Cook wrote that she saw his perfect woman as 'very strong, very upright, a fighter, a laugher, experienced - a black woman I keep seeing her as'.
