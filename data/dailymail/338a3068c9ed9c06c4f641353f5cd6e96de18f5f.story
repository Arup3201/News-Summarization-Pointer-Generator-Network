A heroic police officer who was shot as many as nine times as he responded to a horrific shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin waved off fellow officers and told them to help other victims first.

Lt. Brian Murphy, 51, was repeatedly shot at close range by gunman Wade Michael Page outside the temple in Oak Creek after responding to a 911 call and going to help a victim.

Murphy then tried to disarm Page but suffered multiple gun shots to the neck and his extremities. Despite these injuries, he waved off help so his fellow officers could save others.

Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said that Murphy, along with another police officer who eventually shot the gunman dead, 'stopped a tragedy that could have been a lot worse'.

Hero: Lieutenant Brian Murphy was shot eight or nine times at close range but told his colleagues to help other victims gunned down at a Sikh temple on Sunday. He is in critical condition

Murphy, a 21-year veteran of the police 
force, underwent surgery and is now recovering in hospital with family 
members at his bedside. He is in critical condition but is expected to survive.

The Sikh Human Rights Group has reportedly pledged a $10,000 award to Murphy, who was a finalist for city's police chief post in 2010, for his actions, TMJ4 reported.

'Murphy came upon a victim in the parking lot and exited his vehicle, and went to assist that individual,'  Chief John Edwards during a Monday morning news conference.

'It
was at that point he was met by the suspect, who basically ambushed 
him.  He was shot eight to nine times in very close range with a 
handgun. He was in very close proximity to the shooter.

'He waved [other 
people] off, He told them to get to temple and assist in there. One of 
the officers returned fire with a rife, putting the individual down.'

Officers
had heard gunfire on arriving but only realised Murphy had been shot 
when he the gunman was killed and the officer failed to answer his call.

Killer: Wade Michael Page, 40, shot dead six people and wounded three others on Sunday morning. He has been described as a 'frustrated neo-Nazi' and led a white supremacist band, right

Tragedy: Police watch over the Sikh temple, where a white supremacist shot dead six people on Sunday. A police officer, Lt. Brian Murphy, was shot multiple times as he responded to the scene

He was the first officer on the scene to confront 40-year-old Page who killed six people, aged between 39 and 84, at the temple.

Murphy, who has been a member of Oak Creek police department's tactical team for years, was born in Brooklyn, New York, but moved to the Midwest to be closer to his wife's family, ABC reported.

He has a daughter who lives in South Korea and two stepchildren from his second wife, it added.

Page allegedly walked into the Sikh
Temple of Wisconsin in suburban Milwaukee around 10.30 a.m. on Sunday 
and opened fire as several dozen people prepared for Sunday services.

It sent worshippers fleeing to escape
the barrage - with many hiding in cupboards and texting the outside 
world begging for help.

When
the shooting ended, seven people 
lay dead, including Page at the hands of a police officer. Three others 
were critically wounded in what officers branded an act of domestic 
terrorism.

He used a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, which was recovered at the scene, police said.

Struggle: Amardeep Kaleka, son of the president of the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin comforts members of the temple. His father Satwant Kaleka, 65, died in the shooting with four other priests

Victim: Satwant Kaleka, the temple's founder, died after trying to tackle the gunman

Page, who was discharged from the Army after six years in 1998, was described by officials at the Southern Poverty Law Center as a 'frustrated neo-Nazi' who led a racist white supremacist band.

Page told a white supremacist website in
2010 that he had been part of the white-power music 
scene since 2000 when he left his native Colorado and started the band, 
End Apathy, in 2005.

He
told the website his 'inspiration was based on frustration that we have
the potential to accomplish so much more as individuals and a society 
in whole,' according to the SPLC.

He added that End Apathy was all his own
idea and that topics included sociological issues, religion, and how 
the value of human life has been degraded by being submissive to 
tyranny.

End Apathy's biography on the band's MySpace page said their music 'is a sad commentary on our sick society and the problems that prevent true progress'.

His neighbours in Cudahy, where he moved just two weeks ago, noted that the man was covered in tattoos and 'kind of kept to himself'.

'I just remember seeing (a tattoo that said) 9-11. I just remember thinking it was weird, thinking "Why would you have that tattooed on you?"' April Reyna told TMJ4.

Page is said to have had the tattoo to mark September 11, 2001 - attacks by Islamic militants.

Painful memories: Temple members had hidden in closets in fear for their lives when gunfire broke out

Dr Lee Biblo, the chief medical 
officer at the hospital said they were well prepared to treat the three 
seriously wounded as it is a level one trauma center.

He
said one victim had suffered a single gunshot wound to the abdomen. 
Another had been shot multiple times in the face and extremities while 
the third man had been shot in the neck.

One victim was the temple's 
president, 65-year-old Satwant Kaleka who died as he tried to 'knife and
tackle' the shooter. Another was 39-year-old Parkash Singh, a priest in
his thirties.

Manminder Sethi, who worships at the temple, told the Journal-Sentinel: 'He was a good guy, a noble soul.'

Mr
Singh had lived in Oak Creek for several years and recently brought his
wife, daughter and son from India to live with him in the U.S.

The other victims were named as Seeta Singh, 41, Ranjit Singh, 49, Subegh Singh, 84, and the only woman killed in the attack, 41-year-old Parmjit Kaur, 41.

Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi paid tribute to the victims and police officers on Monday.

'Sunday was a tragic day for our city, especially as it occurred at a place of worship,' he said.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the victims, our wounded officer, and a community which is still in shock. There is no doubt in my mind that the heroic actions of our police officers prevented a greater tragedy.'
