An ex-soldier who accidentally punched a girl he had a crush on in the face died after jumping from the taxi in which they were travelling.

Former Welsh guardsman, Anthony Kelly, 18, became angry with childhood friend Damien Wrigley following a night out and went to hit him in the back of the minibus in Rhyl, North Wales.

However he struck Amy Butler, 18, in the face instead. An inquest heard Mr Kelly was so 
mortified at what he had done he opened the sliding door of the moving 
taxi and leapt out - smashing his skull on the road.

'Such a waste': Anthony Kelly never regained consciousness and died two days later at Glan Clwyd Hospital in North Wales (pictured)

He died two days later from his head injuries at Glan Clwyd hospital in North Wales.

The tragedy occurred in March after Anthony had been out in Rhyl, North Wales, drinking lager and shots with friends.

The inquest in Prestatyn was told the teenager's mood was was 'happy to begin with' but as the night went on he started to act 'different' after Miss Butler began kissing Mr Wrigley.

The group decided to get a taxi home but an argument broke out between Mr Kelly and his friend Mr Wrigley inside the six-seater vehicle.

Miss Butler said: 'Anthony started going a bit mad and Damien restrained him. Anthony leant forward to swing for Damien but instead he hit me.

'He said: "Did I just hit you?" and I said: "Yes". He had a look on his face as if to say: "Oh my God" and that’s when he jumped out of the taxi.'

Inquest: Friends told a hearing in Prestatyn that Anthony Kelly jumped out of the moving taxi just moments after he accidentally punched a girl he liked during a drunken row in the back seat

Another member of the group, Lee-Anna Shires, said Mr Kelly and Mr Wrigley both 'had a thing' for Miss Butler and that it 'all kicked off' after Mr Wrigley and Miss Butler had kissed that night.

In a statement read out at the inquest, Mr Wrigley said: 'When Anthony realised that he’d hit Amy, his face just went blank. He just flopped out of the door and disappeared really quickly.'

He added: 'I can’t help feeling that Anthony’s death could’ve been my fault, that if I hadn’t have gone out that night, it wouldn’t have happened.

'I don’t know why Anthony did what he did - I can’t explain it at all.'

Pathologist Dr Andrew Dalton found that 6ft 6ins Anthony had suffered a fracture to his skull and there was bleeding on his brain. He was three times over the legal drink drive limit at the time of the incident.

Collision investigators found that the taxi did not contribute in any way to Mr Kelly’s death.

The teenager’s mother Becky Kelly said her son never regained consciousness before he passed away.

She described him as a 'great lad with loads of personality' and said he was 'lovely, friendly, honest and sincere'.

The teenager had spent five months on the front line before leaving the Army and was preparing to join the Traders Guild.

Ms Kelly said what her son did was 'really stupid' but she has since taken comfort in donating his organs to help other people.

She said: 'Anthony’s wish was that if anything happened to him that as many of his organs as possible should go to help other people - no matter how painful or difficult the decision was.

'If there is a small crumb of comfort at this difficult time it is that his wish has been granted.'

After leaving high school, Mr Kelly from Prestatyn, spent five months at Bangor Military Preparation College. He served briefly with the Welsh Guards and was said to be a 'popular and fun-loving young man'.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, acting coroner for North East Wales, John Gittins said: 'I accept that Anthony did what he did deliberately, but I do not believe his intention was to bring his life to an end.

'This was a spur of the moment act on his part and I believe Mrs Kelly hit the nail on the head when she said it was a stupid act. He acted spontaneously with very tragic consequences, it is such a waste.'
