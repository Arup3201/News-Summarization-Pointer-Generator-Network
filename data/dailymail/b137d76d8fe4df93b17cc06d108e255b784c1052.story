On a flipchart inside the dressing room at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami, the FA made sure that England’s players were all on message.

‘We are ready for Italy!!!!!’ was scrawled across it in capital letters. They really believe they are.

These are some of the FA’s secrets, one of the rituals Roy Hodgson and various FA officials agree on before the players leave the dressing room to speak with the media.

On the left hand side of the chart, Leighton Baines, Jordan Henderson, Joe Hart and Phil Jagielka had been nominated to stop and speak after England’s laboured 0-0 draw with Honduras.

Secrets revealed: The flip chart in the England dressing room gives instructions to the players

Before they left the dressing room area they were addressed by FA officials and reminded about the positive messages they were expected to hammer home as part of Team England’s propaganda.

Hodgson had already spoken to the players about their performance against Honduras and then approved the various messages written in big capital letters. Most were written by the communications team, although England psychologist Dr Steve Peters presumably plays a part in the positivity.

The chart was left by the entrance to England’s dressing room as the kit men were loading up vans to take to Miami’s international airport before the team flew overnight to Rio de Janeiro.

Despite all the pressures of the World Cup and England’s opening group game against Italy on Saturday in Manaus, Hodgson is across everything.

Briefed by the FA communications team that Argentina’s players had posed with a politically charged and powerful banner claiming the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands before their friendly with Slovenia, Hodgson reacted. He knows his history and the political implications.

‘Don’t answer questions on Falklands’, was written on the board, followed by three exclamation marks.

Captain Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Rickie Lambert were the only three players in England’s squad who were born before the Falklands War in 1982 but Hodgson knows his history.

There were other messages on the flipchart and most of them related to the sterile draw that had just been played.

Hodgson was also pleased that the team travelled to Brazil without any further injuries as they wait for more news on the condition of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

The information, which is written after every game for England’s players, also carried some interesting admissions. Included in the debrief was the message that the England team ‘could have been better with their use of the ball’. The FA were right.

England had 67 per cent possession but had only three shots on target in their final warm-up game. Henderson had 102 touches of the ball, more than any other England player.

The flipchart recorded that England had the ‘best chances’ and that Hodgson was ‘delighted with the workout’.

This is all designed to be positive as England’s players prepare for the World Cup finals.

They arrived in Rio on Sunday morning after a difficult couple of draws against Ecuador and Honduras.

Still, the FA were pleased with the way they reacted against a combative Honduras side, although there is an admission that they were surprised by their approach to a friendly just days before the start of the tournament.

Honduras, ranked 33rd in the world by FIFA, had five players booked and were down to 10 men when right-back Brayan Beckeles was dismissed in the 65th minute.

The players were also instructed to tell the media that ‘we may face this in Brazil’, although the information did not speculate on whether group opponents Italy, Uruguay or Costa Rica will adopt similar, barbaric tactics. It seems unlikely.

The area of discipline was also brought up and the players were reminded that they showed a ‘cool temperament’ in the conditions, particularly after a 45-minute suspension during an electrical storm.

They also looked ahead to the World Cup when the players chosen for media duty were addressed before they walked out of the England dressing room.

Despite three mediocre warm-up games, with victory over Peru and draws with Ecuador and Honduras, the players insist they are fully prepared. They were also ordered not talk about the individuals in Cesare Prandelli’s team during interviews with the media.

Keeper Gianluigi Buffon, plus Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, Andrea Pirlo, Daniele de Rossi, Marco Verratti and Mario Balotelli are the stars in the Italian squad.

Italy  have won the World Cup four times and, despite seven games without a win in the build-up, they will be a massive threat to England in Manaus on Saturday.

Staying on message, Henderson carried out Hodgson’s instructions when he was asked who would be given the job of marking Pirlo.

Henderson said: ‘It’s up to the manager to decide. Obviously this week we’ll be looking at them on a more tactical level. That’s up to the manager to decide what tactics he personally wants.’

The next point on the England flipchart was to remind the players that their flight to the Urca military base in Rio meant that it was the start of the ‘real thing’.

The final message to the players was not to mention the ‘Les Malvinas son Argentinas’ banner held up by the country’s players before their 2-0 victory over Slovenia in front of a 52,000 crowd on Saturday.

The FA confirmed on Sunday night that the flipchart is part of an official briefing to players.
