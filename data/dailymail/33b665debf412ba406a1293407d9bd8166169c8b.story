The Duchess of Cambridge has been sitting for her first royal portrait.

The artist in question is Welsh born Nicky Philipps and it has been reported that the Duchess has made four secret visits to Philipps' South Kensington studio while husband Prince William is on a tour of duty in The Falklands.

The painting is said to have cost £25,000 and been paid for by the Prince of Wales. It is likely to be a birthday gift for Prince William to be presented on the occasion of his official 30th birthday in June.

A Palace spokesperson today found herself unable to comment, saying merely that any such portrait is 'an entirely private matter'.

However, earlier this year, when discussing a potential portrait, Philipps stated that she wouldn’t turn down an opportunity to paint the Duchess in a million years, continuing that 'beautiful people are always more difficult...

'With symmetrical faces, there’s nothing to hang the portrait on. It’s very unlikely that you’ll ever do them enough justice.'

The artist stressed the importance of sittings: 'the human eye has so many more resources at its disposal than the camera, being a technical object, ever will — however sophisticated. Nobody will give you everything in a very short space of time.'

She also admitted that posing for a portrait was 'an alien situation: sitting in the corner of some room and being stared at for a long time.

'It can be quite intimidating, so you need time for people to relax. Then, gradually, things come out. The more I'm given by my sitter, the better the portrait will be.'

Philipps has previously been commissioned to paint Princes William and Harry and her double portrait of the royal duo is currently on show in London's National Portrait Gallery.

The two princes are dressed in the uniform of Household Cavalry regiment Blues and Royals and are set against a backdrop of Clarence House.

In a break with royal protocol, Kate failed to pose for an official wedding portrait, however, it is likely that her first official portrait is now also on the cards.

As National Portrait Gallery director Sandy Nairne told The Evening Standard in February: 'It’s very early days, but we’ve started a discussion. It will be at least the summer before there’s anything concrete and we can start to look for an artist.'

Today, the Palace spokesperson confirmed that 'Kate is currently in talks for her first public painting to go in The National Portrait Gallery'.
