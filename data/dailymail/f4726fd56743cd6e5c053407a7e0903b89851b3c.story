Parents need to be aware predators could use smartphone location apps to monitor and track the precise location of their children, the former head of MI6 has warned.

Sir John Scarlett has said there is no 'absolute protection' of information children share online and once smartphone location apps have been given consent to track the phone, it is difficult to control who uses the information.

Ahead of a speech at the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) annual meeting in Newport, south Wales, Sir John said that the world, and above all the technological environment, has rapidly changed.

The former spy chief warned that in general, there is 'no absolute protection' against a determined online attack, adding it is vital to know what young people are learning online.

The public can protect themselves by using passwords and other measures against 80% of intrusions but 'everybody has to understand that you can't be absolutely certain that somebody, somewhere, won't get it'.

Information gathered through tracking apps is meant to be secure - however, recent scandals such as the celebrity nude photos hacks have shown such data can be easily accessed for other, more sinister purposes.

Sir John, who served as chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service for five years until 2009, said: 'You've got to know what your children are doing, it's very difficult to know exactly what they're doing in particular when they're on a tablet or something they've got and you've got to have some kind of idea.

'They are extremely vulnerable, everybody is, to a whole range of things. Clearly when they're young children they're particularly vulnerable to predators.'

He said this also included sexual predators.

'Personally what worries me, in a way, most, is tracking devices.

'The way in which locational apps for example are now quite freely available, of course you can start off by consciously giving out that information, but once you've done that, you've lost control of it.

'There is a need for everyone to be aware that once information is shared online, for example through using a search engine, it can be used by different firms, '

He added that youngsters can also be tracked through getting into conversations online, or by using apps that use an individual's location.

'It's the tracking, and obviously if you get into conversations, I don't really see how that can be controlled unless you have some idea what your child's doing.'

His 'basic advice' was to teach children common sense values to stick to, such as being aware of the information they give out and how they express themselves.

Young girls were obviously vulnerable to tracking and there were individuals able to track someone 'right down to more or less precisely where you are'.

He also suggested that the public should be more worried about threats from terrorists and international criminal networks than the Government snooping on them. 

MailOnline has requested comment from Apple. 

The way in which an online predator could go about tracking a child's smartphone is astonishingly simple.

Only days ago the FBI indicted a man for selling a spyware application which could monitor smartphones' calls, texts, videos and phone calls.

Not only could it monitor that information, but it could pick up the phone's GPS as well as operate its microphone turning it into a bug to listen into conversations up to 15 feet away from the handset.

For example, Find My iPhone  is an security-enabled app which enables a GPS inside the phone to give off a signal. Theoretically, in the event of the theft of the phone, you can then use your secure log-on to find its exact location on a web browser.

However, spyware programmes - for which the predator needs only a few minutes on their victim's phone to install - enables the data from that phone to be synchronised with its customer's account on the internet.

This information includes the GPS signal given off by the phone - which when monitored online (either by its intended user, or a predator using spyware) gives off a green dot signalling its exact location.

If you suspect your phone has been infected with spyware, it's recommended you perform a factory reset which will delete all data and apps installed after the handset was purchased.
