Britain's most feckless father  is behind bars today after failing to turn up at court to face a charge of assaulting an ex-girlfriend and stealing from her.

Keith Macdonald has nine children with eight different women and was due to appear before court in June after he headbutted Stephanie Jubb in an argument over a cheese toastie, leaving her with a bloody nose.

Sunderland Magistrates' Court heard how he then snatched £80 and Miss Jubb's mobile phone and fled the house they shared in Meadow Street, East Rainton, County Durham.

The terrified 24-year-old fled to neighbour Paul Gascoigne's house to call 999 and said she had been 'angry and upset' since the incident which occurred on March 1 this year.

Miss Jubb had been previously in an on-off relationship with Macdonald which ended in 2009, but heard from her ex again at the end of 2011 where he said that he was 'getting older' the pair began living together in February this year.

Giving evidence in June, Miss Jubb said: 'He came back and I could smell alcohol on his breath and his eyes were quite bloodshot.

'He was fine he was chatty, he made himself a toastie and went to go upstairs to eat it.

'I told him 'you're not eating that upstairs, I've just hoovered.

'He then threw the toastie and the plate on the kitchen table and shouted 'F**k it!''

She confronted Macdonald and ripped out the plug of his X-Box console, and in retaliation he ran downstairs, threw her Nintendo Wii across the room and assaulted her, leaving her with two black eyes.

But Macdonald, 28, failed to turn up for a trial at the court on June 13, where he was convicted of assault, stealing the money, a Sony Ericsson mobile phone and causing criminal damage to a Wii games console.

He was brought before city JPs yesterday after handing himself in to police. Macdonald admitted a charge of absconding.

Prosecutor Lee Poppett said: 'Four months have passed and he had not handed himself in until he was arrested at some point today or yesterday.'

The court heard Macdonald already had one conviction for assaulting Miss Jubb and another for kicking ex-partner Rebecca Wright and grabbing her mother Brenda.

Defending, Gavin Sword said Macdonald, who was living in Stoke, had intended to travel back to Sunderland for the trial, but lost his train ticket and could not afford to replace it.

He added that Macdonald had called his office a number of times since June to say he was intending to come back to the North East.

Chairman of the bench John Scott ordered Macdonald to remain in custody two weeks while Probation Service prepared a pre-sentence report, and was warned that they will examine all options, including jail.

The jobless 25-year-old, who met most of his conquests at bus stops, has convictions for violence against one of his ex-girlfriends.

In 2008, he was given a three-year suspended sentence and ordered to undertake an anger management course after assaulting Bec Wright, now 21, and her mother while living at their home. Miss Wright gave birth to his daughter, Clio, in the same year.

He has a series of previous convictions, including a prison sentence for hitting another man with a pint glass.

Macdonald, who spends his money on lager and fruit machines, has also had restraining orders taken out against him by two of his children’s mothers and spent time in jail for breaking one of the orders.

In 2011 Keith was caught out on Panorama when he could not remember the names of all his children.
