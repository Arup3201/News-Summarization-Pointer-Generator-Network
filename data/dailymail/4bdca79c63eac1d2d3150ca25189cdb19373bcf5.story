Honoured: Margaret Rigby, 99, has been recognised as the longest serving member of the Girl Guides

A 99-year-old who has served in the Girl Guides since she was 13 has been recognised as the country's longest serving member.

Margaret Rigby from Chorley, Lancashire, has devoted most of her life to the group - and has just received a British Medal Empire in the New Year's Honours List for her efforts.

After being a guide and a ranger in the 1920s and 30s, she continued her service after the war and was secretary and leader of various guiding groups.

She now serves in the Trefoil Guild, an adult group which gives practical, financial and moral support to the guiding and scouting movement.

And Mrs Rigby has no intention of giving up.

She said: 'I have been involved with the Girl Guides continuously for 86 years, I've never stopped or taken a break, because I love everything about it.

'I was 13 at the time and the church my family went to started up a group, and so most girls my age from the area joined.

'We got up to all-sorts and were awarded all sorts of badges. There's nothing like it for teaching you valuable life skills that you just wouldn't learn anywhere else, and it's still very much part of who I am.'

Mrs Rigby said her commitment to guiding even extended to helping the war effort between 1939-1945.

'I remember during 1941 in particular, there was a lot of bombing and it was difficult for people to get out so we would meet in the afternoon as there was a blackout in the evenings.

'We helped by collecting newspapers and jam jars which the Army were appealing for'

The Girl Guide has mastered a variety 
of skills throughout her career with the group - including lighting 
fires, cooking and camping.

She
 said: 'Camping is my favourite thing to do and I have been Camp Advisor
 during my time, going to find new places for us to set up camp and 
checking they were suitable.

'I really enjoyed all of it though, I could never give it up.

'Everyone
 involved is so friendly, it's like having a second family and such a 
warming and welcoming environment. I have met so many friends and kept 
in touch with them all'

Mrs Rigby, who was widowed in 1992 when her husband Thomas died after 50 years of marriage, has been recognised for services to the organisation in Lancashire, and will be awarded her medal at a garden party at Buckingham Palace shortly after her 100th birthday in June.

It is thought Mrs Rigby, who has no children, is also the oldest person on the 2014 New Years' Honours list.

She said: 'In the middle of November I
 got an official letter from London saying I had got it and asking 
whether I wished to accept it. I thought it was a mistake to start with!

'I'm really pleased. It's 
very flattering to be thought of in such high regard by the people in 
the Lancashire Guild who nominated me.

'The movement has been my passion and it continues to bring me joy that girls and young women get so much out of the activities.

'I would recommend guiding to all young girls because you do so much. You would never have been interested in something like astronomy but there is so much for them to learn'

A spokesman for the Trefoil Guild said: 'We're so excited about the honour, because it's so well deserved.

'Margaret's commitment is ongoing and she continues to give her time to the cause.'

Then and now: The Girl Guide looks through a photo album of all of her adventures  at home in Chorley

Award: Mrs Rigby is the oldest person on the New Year's Honours list and will receive her medal shortly
