Missing A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after Rui Li (pictured) disappeared after finishing her shift at a hospital five days ago

A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a nurse disappeared after finishing her shift at a hospital five days ago.

Rui Li, 44, was last seen leaving Poole Hospital in Poole, Dorset, at around 6pm on Friday, May 23. 

Detectives, who said they feared the 
nurse had 'come to some harm', said that they had arrested a 60-year-old 
man on suspicion of her murder after concerned friends reported her missing to police yesterday morning.

The man from Bournemouth, is said to be known to Ms Li.

Police are now searching three addresses in the Boscombe area, including Burnham Drive.

Detective Inspector Marcus Hester, of Dorset Police’s Major Crime Investigation Team, has now appealed for the public’s help to piece together Ms Li’s last movements.

'We sadly have reason to believe Ms Li may have come to harm and have arrested a man on suspicion of murder,' DI Hester said.

'However, at this time we do not know her whereabouts.

'Our investigations are focused on establishing exactly what happened between Friday evening and the time Ms Li was reporting missing to us on Tuesday morning.

'I would ask anyone who has seen or heard from her since she left work at Poole Hospital to contact us.

'We are building up a picture of her life, so I would also ask anyone who we haven’t spoken to already, who knew her well and may have information that could assist us, to get in touch.'

Ms Li is described as a slim woman of Chinese appearance, around 5ft 5ins tall.

She sometimes wears glasses and often has her shoulder-length black hair in a ponytail.

Detectives have not found the 44-year-old’s body but they are concerned believe she may have come to harm.

The middle-aged man was being held in the police cells while he awaits questioning by senior detectives.
