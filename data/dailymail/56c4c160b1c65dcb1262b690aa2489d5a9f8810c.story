Venezuela will set up an inquiry into suspicions the late president Hugo Chavez was poisoned by his enemies abroad.

Acting president Nicolas Maduro said an investigation will begin into the claims first voiced by Chavez in 2011.

The outspoken leader suggested the U.S. might have 'invented technology to spread cancer' after Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner became the fifth Latin American to be diagnosed with the disease in a year.

'We will seek the truth,' Mr Maduro told regional TV network Telesur. 'We have the intuition that our commander Chavez was poisoned by dark forces that wanted him out of the way.'

Foreign scientists will be invited to join a state committee to investigate the accusation, he said.

The announcement has been slammed by Venezuela's opposition party as a cynical move by Mr Maduro to capitalise on the outpouring of grief for Hugo Chavez in the run-up to fresh elections.

'Let's take the president (Chavez) away from the political debate, out of respect for his memory, his family, his supporters,' said opposition candidate Henrique Capriles' campaign chief, Henri Falcon.

Nicolas Maduro, the former foreign minister and vicepresident, is regarded as Chavez's hand-picked successor and is running as the government's candidate in a snap election called for April 14.

He was a close friend and ally of Chavez and was often accompanied him to Cuba for his cancer treatment.

Mr Maduro is believed to be one of only a handful of insiders who knew Chavez's diagnoses which were treated as a state secret.

In
December 2011 Chavez used a speech to the military and broadcast on 
television to accuse the U.S. of spreading cancer among Latin American 
leaders.

'It’s very 
difficult to explain, even with the law of probabilities, what has been 
happening to some of us in Latin America,' Mr Chavez said.

'Would it be so strange that they’ve invented technology to spread cancer and we won’t know about it for 50 years?'

He also warned his allies Evo Morales, of Bolivia, and Ecuador's Rafael Correa that they should watch out for attempts to bring them down.

Other South American politicians to have been struck by the disease include Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff, her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Fernando Lugo, president of Paraguay.

Hugo Chavez was first diagnosed with a tumour in his pelvic region in June 2011 which was removed.

He underwent four rounds of chemotherapy in Cuba before announcing that he was cured.

But the disease evidently returned and Chavez passed away at the age of 58 on March 5.

His death has prompted a huge response in Venezuela as thousands turned out to watch his coffin as it made its way to a state funeral.
