The return of the England v Scotland fixture next week seems to have captured the imagination of football fans far more north of the border. The friendly at Glasgow’s Celtic Park on Tuesday is on course to be a sell-out apart from the England section of the stadium.

The FA were given an allocation of 7,200 for their official supporters’ club but have sold only 5,077 — and hundreds of those have been cancelled after the insistence that the tickets were collected in person in Glasgow before the match, for security reasons.

Wembley will be pleased that their security arrangements have rooted out potential troublemakers plus touts looking to sell seats in the English end to the Scottish market. But the empty spaces among the travelling support reflects the match taking place on midweek and England fans’ continued upset that watching games at Wembley is now worth double the loyalty points for Euro 2016 tickets compared to going to away matches.

And like in Switzerland and Estonia, that grievance will be the subject of numerous chants by the England fans who do travel to Scotland.

The problem with overseas TV feeds of 3pm Saturday Premier League matches being beamed into UK pubs and clubs — prevalent at the start of the season — has been resolved to the extent that beIN Sport, the biggest offenders, will be allowed to show confiscated Saturday afternoon games across their Middle East territory after the international break.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was at Wembley to watch the recent NFL game starring the Dallas Cowboys

Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner satisfied Jose Mourinho’s relentless team are on course to becoming No 1 in the country, has charged new commercial chief Christian Purslow with replicating that success off the field. 

But Manchester United are way ahead of Chelsea in the commercial table. Meanwhile Mourinho, who was at Wembley to watch the American Football, had a pre-match touchline conversation with Jerry Jones, singular owner of the Dallas Cowboys who takes on the NFL authorities in much the same manner Jose does over here.

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, who doesn’t look like he’s been near a gym recently, is nevertheless going to attempt to revolutionize the busy fitness market. Ashley’s Sports Direct are opening 200 gyms nationwide, starting in Liverpool. 

They will have a joining fee of £10 and just £5-a-month membership. This compares with the RFU owned Virgin Active Classic gym at Twickenham where 3,000 members pay £40-a-month for facilities that include an indoor pool.

Horne’s sponsor woe

Alex Horne, general secretary of the FA, claimed a few weeks ago that there would be a sponsor signed up for the FA Cup third round. And the clock is ticking with no backer in sight, according to Wembley insiders, and just four weeks until the draw for the third round is broadcast live. Horne is leaving anyway but heads will have to roll if no sponsor is attracted for this marquee endorsement.

Meanwhile, the FA are understood to have agreed to use headhunters to find Horne’s replacement when chairman Greg Dyke had wanted to explore the option of doing the search in-house to save money. That would certainly have left Dyke open to accusations of cronyism in filling one of football’s most important roles.

Arsenal invited members of their 1970 winning European Fairs Cup side to their Champions League match against Anderlecht whom they beat 4-3 on aggregate 44 years ago. But bizarrely UEFA do not recognise the Fairs Cup competition as they did not run it and there is no reference to it anywhere on their website or official records.

The murky backdrop to Massimo Cellino’s ownership of Leeds is that former managing director David Haigh has now been locked up in a Dubai jail for six months without facing a criminal charge.

Haigh’s latest move is for his lawyers to write a 78-page legal letter to the PR representatives, Woodstock Leasor, of his former employees GFH Capital alleging they have leaked information to the media about Haigh’s private life. Haigh’s PR representatives have also received heavy legal letters in return.
