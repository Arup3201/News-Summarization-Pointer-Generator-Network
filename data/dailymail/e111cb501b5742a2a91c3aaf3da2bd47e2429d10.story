Nick Clegg attacked the House of Lords yesterday, describing it as an ‘affront’ to liberal democracy.

Forming an upper chamber using proportional representation has emerged as a key Liberal Democrat demand for staying in a coalition with the Conservatives.

The Deputy Prime Minister said legislation to replace the Lords with elected senators would be introduced early next year.

And in an attempt to cheer his party’s core supporters, he also argued for a ‘liberal approach to tax’ that would distinguish between earned income and ‘unearned wealth’.

Pledge: Nick Clegg, pictured today, vowed that reform of the House of Lords will go ahead as he delivered the annual Demos Lecture at Westminster Central Hall

Lib Dem sources said the party would push for a ‘mansion tax’ on expensive properties, or new taxes on high earners’ pensions.

On Lords reform, Mr Clegg said a Bill
will be introduced for a mostly elected upper chamber – a change that 
could be forced past the Lords and into law by use of the Parliament Act
if necessary.

Until now, Mr Clegg had taken a back 
seat on the issue – allowing Tory Cabinet Office minister Mark Harper to
take the lead – but aides say he is now making Lords reform a key Lib 
Dem policy, despite significant opposition from Conservative MPs and 
peers.

The move would finally break the link
between peerages and the permanent right to sit in the legislature, 
following decades of controversy over ‘cash for honours’.

Reform: Nick Clegg today promised to use the Parliament Act if necessary to push through reform of the House of Lords. The Lib Dems want an 80 per cent elected upper chamber

At least 80 per cent of senators 
would be elected using the single transferable vote electoral system 
long favoured by the Liberal Democrats. The system is likely to result 
in no party having an overall majority in the second chamber, as is the 
case currently.

Prime ministers would still be able to appoint a small number of unelected senators to temporary seats in the Lords.

There are almost 800 members of the 
House of Lords, making it the second-largest legislative body in the 
world after the Chinese People’s Congress – but, on average, only 388 
attend each day.

Under the Coalition’s plans, the 
Lords would be transformed over 15 years into a largely elected chamber 
with 300 members.

Constitutional reform: Labour removed all but the last 92 hereditary peers from the House of Lords in 1999, however the second phase of reform stalled and was never completed

Critics argue that an elected second chamber would 
demand greater powers to block legislation from the Commons, although 
ministers insist none are planned.

Speaking at the think-tank Demos, Mr Clegg described the Lords as ‘perhaps the most potent symbol of a closed society’.

‘The Lords as currently constituted is an affront to the principles of openness which underpin a modern democracy,’ he said.

The Deputy Prime Minister 
acknowledged he would need ‘a significant degree of cross-party 
consensus on this, and indeed support from Lords themselves’, but added:
‘Let there be no doubt: if it comes to a fight, the will of the Commons
will prevail.’
