Robert Lyn, pictured, was jailed for life after he murdered Daniel Campbell who was allegedly sleeping with his girlfriend Stephanie Slade

A man who brutally stabbed to death a love rival after discovering he was having an affair with his girlfriend through Facebook has been jailed for life.

Robert Lyn, 45, from Huddersfield  travelled to victim Daniel Campbell's flat and stabbed him repeatedly after learning of the infidelity.

Bradford Crown Court that Lynn had stopped off at Aldi to purchase three knives before breaking into the flat on July 18 and launching the attack.

Lynn stabbed Mr Campbell seven times in the neck and a further 13 times in the stomach. The court heard that he had not suffered any defensive wounds and was probably asleep at the time of the attack. 

Earlier that evening Victoria Sugden received a mistaken phone call from Stephanie Slade's mobile where she overheard her friend discussing with Mr Campbell what they had been doing the previous evening.

After listening to details of the alleged infidelity, Miss Sugden messaged Lyn over Facebook just after 5.30pm on July 18. 

She wrote: 'I'm really upset. I can't sleep, but her and Dan slept with each other last night at his. I heard them discussing it when Steph's phone rang me but she didn't know. So sorry Rob.'

Minutes later Lyn asked Miss Sugden for Mr Campbell's address and after she told him he bought half a bottle of brandy before getting a lift to Elland.

In a phone call to Miss Slade's daughter he asked: 'Why has she done this... we are supposed to be in love."

Lyn bought a set of three knives from the Aldi store and took one of them with him when he went to Mr Campbell's flat at about 7pm that night.

A neighbour described him as looking 'possessed' and as he kicked at the flat door he shouted: 'I know you're in there, let me show you what a real man is.'

Lyn discovered the allegation after he received a message from Mr Campbell's own girlfriend Victoria Sugden, who later gave Lyn her boyfriend's address. Lyn then travelled to Elizabeth Street, Elland, pictured. 

Justice Coulson sitting at Bradford Crown Court, pictured, said the case highlighted 'the pernicious effect of Facebook' and criticised Miss Sugden for messaging Lyn before speaking to those involved first

After getting no response Lyn emptied the soil from a concrete planter and then used it to break down the door before climbing onto the bed to attack Mr Campbell as he slept.

The court heard that Miss Slade had been in the bathroom while Lyn 'butchered' Mr Campbell, while he was asleep. 

As he left the flat on Elizabeth Street, Elland, Lyn asked Miss Slade: 'How do you like your boyfriend now?'  

Lyn was arrested soon after the murder by a police constable and an off-duty colleague and said: "Is he dead yet? What would you ******* do if you caught your girlfriend cheating on you?"

The Honourable Mr Justice Coulson sentenced Lyn, to life imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to the murder and said he would have to serve a minimum of 26 years in jail before being considered for release by the Parole Board.

Lyn almost collapsed in the dock as the judge passed sentence on him and his barrister Richard Wright QC conceded that his client could die in prison or be a very old man when he was released.

Mr Wright described the death of Mr Campbell as 'wholly needless and pointless' and suggested that circumstances had combined with Lyn's personality traits to cause the 'terrible explosion of violence'.

Mr Justice Coulson said a letter he had received from Lyn did now express genuine remorse and he suggested that the case highlighted the 'pernicious effect of Facebook'.

He said Miss Sugden's decision to tell the world before speaking to those involved seemed particularly thoughtless and her misjudgment was to have fatal consequences.

The judge told Lyn that he had inflicted severe injuries upon Mr Campbell and added: 'Indeed it is no exaggeration to say that you butchered him.'

Family and friends of Mr Campbell packed the public gallery and he was described in victim impact statements as a man who was loved by his family, made friends easily and had everything to live for.
