A 15-year-old schoolgirl has vowed never to take legal highs again after revealing she suffers panic attacks and anxiety from a drug known as 'Blue Cheese'.

Paige Smith, of Colchester, Essex, said she bought the drug - which is legally available to over-18s - without ID from a shop in the town after friends introduced her to legal highs five months ago.

She became addicted and spent more than £200 buying the brightly-packaged recreational drugs over the counter before she was taken to hospital after feeling ‘instantly weird and shaky’.

Paige, who has had counselling, called for the drug to be banned, saying: ‘I felt instantly weird and shaky and my tongue felt like it was disappearing. I was crying a lot and terrified, so I called my mum.

‘When I read about that girl left in hospital I realised how lucky I was. You don't know what goes in these things - there are no ingredients and you could get ill or, in the worst case, die.’

Legal highs range from herbal highs, synthetic highs and mixtures of the two. 

The Association of Chief Police Officers said they are designed to produce the same or similar effects to illegal stimulant drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy but are not controlled under legislation.

It is illegal to sell them for human consumption, so they are marketed as research chemicals, plant food, bath crystals, pond cleaner or souvenir cannabis seeds. 

An A&E consultant at Colchester General Hospital in Essex this week said he had treated four teenagers who had collapsed in recent weeks. All had taken legal highs. 

An all-party parliamentary group was set up to examine regulation of legal highs and experts say the legislation is 40 years out of date. 

Experts also believe when the next set of tests are carried out many being sold in shops in Essex will contain substances which are either illegal or are so harmful they will be banned.

Paige has vowed to never touch the legal highs again but said her friends continue to use them.

Her mother Heidi Thorpe, 34, said: ‘When I found out what she was doing I wasn't impressed. Before this she was so outgoing and I'd have trouble keeping her in. But she's so nervous now she won't even leave the house.’

It is illegal to sell legal highs to under-18s, but Paige said she was never asked for ID - a claim denied by the owner of Sheppards, the shop where she bought the drug in Colchester.

Paige added: ‘The first drug I took was Black Mamba, which felt trippy and gave me the giggles. I kept coming back to it.

'We would take it in the daytime outside Firstsite (a Colchester art gallery), or walking around town. I had no problem buying them and I don't look 18 without make up on.’

She said she ignored warnings saying ‘not for human consumption’ because she heard it was simply a way of making the drugs legal for sale.

Black Mamba was taken off the shelves at Sheppards before it was made into a Class B illegal drug in February.

Essex Police urged people to report claims of underage service. Sergeant Sue Richardson said: ‘We are aware of the issue and remain concerned. We are working with Trading Standards.’
