Oscar Pistorius and his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp had a 'loving and caring' relationship, his manager told the Olympic athlete's murder trial today.

Peet Van Zyl said Pistorius and his model girlfriend called each other pet names and the athlete was making plans to take her away on international trips shortly before he fatally shot her.

The defence called Mr Van Zyl to the stand in an attempt to bolster Pistorius' account that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder, providing testimony about a loving relationship and a fear of crime that may have pushed the Paralympian to fire through a closed toilet door.

Peet Van Zyl said Pistorius and his model girlfriend called each other pet names and the athlete was making plans to take her away on international trips shortly before he fatally shot her

The agent faced tough questioning from
 the chief prosecutor, however, about Pistorius' alleged egotism and 
tantrums, high-speed driving and love of guns.

Giving evidence at the trial, Mr Van Zyl told the court the athlete was nervous and 'fidgety' at home and had a 'heightened sense of awareness.'

Mr Van Zyl recalled to the court how on one occasion Pistorius drove at high speed to the airport and, when told there was no rush, recalled a traumatic episode in which Mr Van Zyl was accosted at gunpoint while in his car in 2007.

'He wanted to ensure that we are safe and not being followed,' Mr Van Zyl said.

He also remembered a time when Pistorius grabbed him by the arm in apparent fear when the pair heard a loud bang while walking in New York City, and described two occasions in which the runner lost his temper but was not aggressive under 'abusive questioning' from journalists.

He also said he was assisting Pistorius in plans to take Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, to races in Britain and Brazil, and a concert in Italy.

Pistorius has testified that he fired through a closed bathroom door, killing Steenkamp, in the mistaken belief there was a dangerous intruder in his home

Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel tried to 
pick holes in Van Zyl's testimony, pressing the agent for details about a
 reported incident in which a South African athlete who was sharing a 
room with Pistorius asked for them to be separated because Pistorius was
 allegedly arguing frequently on his telephone.

He
 also referred to a 2012 Paralympics race in which Pistorius accused the
 winner of breaking the rules by using prosthetic limbs that were too 
long.

Van Zyl acknowledged 
that it was the 'wrong place and wrong time for him to react in such a 
way' but noted there was a 'long lead-up' to the incident in which 
Pistorius had expressed concerns that rules were being flouted.

Mr Nel also described Pistorius' plans
 to take Steenkamp on trips as an example of alleged narcissism after 
Van Zyl quoted the athlete as saying he wanted his girlfriend 'to see 
what my world is about, the pressure that I'm under' and 'how I need to 
perform.'

Earlier, the hearing focused on the screams that neighbours say they heard on the night the athlete killed his girlfriend.

Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel (pictured) today cross-examined acoustics expert Ivan Lin, who gave evidence yesterday about the challenges of hearing accurately from a distance

Mr Nel questioned an acoustics expert who was called by the defence team as part of its effort to suggest some neighbours who testified they heard the screams of a woman were wrong.

They argue the witnesses actually heard the high-pitched screams of the double-amputee runner.

The acoustics expert, Ivan Lin, testified that he conducted tests that showed ambient noise and other factors can make it difficult to hear accurately from a distance.

Mr
 Lin questioned whether neighbours 177 metres away could have 
heard screams coming from the toilet, or identified them as a man or 
woman.

‘At 177 metres 
away, if the scream was from the toilet, it is highly unlikely that the 
listener can hear the screams, let alone interpret the sound source 
reliably,’ he said.

Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated murder, and could also face years in prison if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing

Mr Nel said 
the screams of a woman have a 'tonal character' and referred to the 
testimony of the neighbours who were convinced they had heard a 
screaming woman.

Mr Lin responded that he could not say whether they were 'correct or incorrect'.

Pistorius has testified that he fired 
through a closed bathroom door, killing Steenkamp, in the mistaken 
belief there was a dangerous intruder in his home.

The prosecution has alleged that Pistorius, 27, killed 29-year-old Steenkamp after a Valentine's Day argument.

Pistorius
 faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated 
murder, and could also face years in prison if convicted of murder 
without premeditation or negligent killing. He is free on bail.

The trial continues.
