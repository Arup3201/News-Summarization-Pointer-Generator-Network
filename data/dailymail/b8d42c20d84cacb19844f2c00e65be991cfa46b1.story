Parents hoping to get Disney’s latest video game, Disney Infinity, when it launches in June, be warned; the complete collection will set you back more than £300.

This costs more than an iPad Mini, and depending what console your child has, this cost could be even higher.  

The price includes the video game, collectible Disney characters, the Disney Infinity Base, Play Sets, interactive game pieces and power discs.

It has been developed by Avalanche Software and combines physical, collectible Disney characters with in-game, virtual ones.

Speaking at the event, John Pleasants said, 'Disney Infinity introduces a new way to interact with the best of Disney on one game platform, both now and in the future.

'With this innovative approach to gaming, Disney Infinity will bring to life new characters, stories and environments from The Walt Disney Company over time in a way that will delight fans and gamers alike.'

When Disney Infinity launches this summer, there will be 17 collectible characters to choose from including Sulley from Monster’s Inc., Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, and Mr. Incredible, from The Incredibles.

There will also be 40 interactive game pieces including swords and character accessories to collect.

The first three Play Sets, which are different adventure worlds, will be Monsters University, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The Incredibles.

Each Play Sets is based on a Disney film with recognisable sets, characters and storylines.

You use your connected characters to explore Play Sets, solve puzzles, fight 
villains, and complete quests.

More characters, pieces and Play Sets are expected to launch later in the year.

The game will be available for the Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS when it launches in June.

Disney Infinity Starter Packs are available for pre-order from Amazon, Game and Toys R Us.

To connect the collectible toys to the video game, you'll need the Disney Infinity Base. You can add two characters at a time

Each Starter Pack includes the video game, a Disney Infinity Base, three Play Sets, three Infinity figures, an Infinity Power Disc, and web codes to unlock online content.

You
 can play Disney Infinity with virtual characters, using campaign 
mode, or with a mix of physical and in-game characters using Toy Box 
mode.

To add a physical Disney character to your game, attach it to the Disney Infinity Base.

You can play the built-in game, or select a Play Set - available separately.

The
 more you explore, the more vehicles, tokens and upgrades you can earn. 
All these items are stored in your virtual Toy Box.

You can access 
these items at any point during gameplay to boost a character’s 
strength, or unlock doors and levels, for example.

Disney Infinity comes with a two-player, split-screen mode, or you can play with up to four other people online.

Each figure stores your game’s progress and how much in-game currency you have earned.

To
 apply an upgrade to a character put the relevant upgrade 
token – available separately - under the figure on the Infinity Base.

You won't be able to buy the video game, or the Disney Infinity Base on its own when it launches; you will only be able to get them as part of a Starter Pack.

Disney hasn't confirmed the exact release date of Disney Infinity, but Toys R Us have it listed as available from 28 June 2013.

A mobile version of the game is expected towards the end of the year.

Disney Infinity is not the first game to combine physical toys with video games.

Game maker Activision released Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure in December 2011, followed by Skylanders Giants in October last year.

Similar to Disney Infinity, both Skylanders games let you play with collectible characters attached to a game base called the 'Portal of Power'.

There are also iPad apps that work with physical toys, including Disney's Appmates Cars 2, which lets you take part in racing games by moving the toy car over the iPad's screen.

By comparison, a Skylanders Starter Pack starts at £27.99 for the PC version.

Individual characters cost around £13.

Two Disney Appmates cars will set you back £40.
