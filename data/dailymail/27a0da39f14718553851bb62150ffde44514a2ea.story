Fans of Thom Evans know that he has no qualms about stripping off for photo shoots, even claiming to be 'comfortable with what I'm packing', but now he is hoping to be taken more seriously by leaving his clothes on for a change.

The 28-year-old former rugby hunk is the face of an autumn/winter 2013 campaign for new menswear tailoring range Aston Martin Collection by BespokeHQ, which sees him smoulder in a series of exclusive campaign images.

And whilst his female fans are more accustomed to seeing him flaunt his abs in photo shoots, the former Scottish fullback proves he can pull off the suited and booted look too.

A spokesman for the brand said: 'It's a brand new look for Thom - very sophisticated and grown up - as he models the collection on location in East London.

'It's all part of the new image he's carving out as he moves into an acting career.'

The menswear collection, which starts at £1,000, includes bespoke two and three piece suits, tailored jackets and overcoats in addition to accessories including shirts and ties - all modelled to perfection by Thom.

Contrast coloured check jackets feature suave double pocket detail with classic lapels, all accentuated by flashes of colour on the lining and around the subtly branded Aston Martin buttons inspired by archive Aston Martin interior design details.

The ex-rugby pro, who previously dated Kelly Brook, has been seeing Jessica Lowndes, 24, who starred in TV show 90210, for around seven months.

Evans retired from rugby in 2010 after a serious spine injury and has a metal superstructure in his neck, meaning he can't indulge in high-risk pastimes such as water sports.

He's now signed to Select model agency and judging by the latest stream of photo shoot, he appears to be doing very well in his new career.

He presently weighs 12st 7lb, an entire two stone lighter that when he was playing rugby and says that he is the leanest he's ever been - though he still exercises religiously, sprinting outdoors and using a rowing machine.

They are widely acknowledged as one of showbiz's most beautiful couples of the moment, and proving she can give her man a run for his money in the modelling stakes, Jessica has just been unveiled as the glamorous new face of Lipsy London's fragrance.

After dazzling in their dresses on the red carpet, the brand asked the actress to front their new perfume campaign.

With her glossy locks and sultry smokey eyes, Jessica smoulders in front of the camera for the new shoot. And now she has shared the secrets behind her beauty and fitness regime with MailOnline.

Speaking about her latest gig, she said: 'I am so honoured to be apart of Lipsy London Glam's campaign.

'It's a delicious, sweet scent of apricot and cherry, but it also has jasmine and black incense which makes it romantic and sexy, I wear it both day and night.'

Speaking about her favourite beauty products, the star revealed that she loves Laura Mercier body scrubs, Kerastase hair moisture masks, Bioré make-up removing wipes, and a witch-hazel based toner to beat the blemishes.

Speaking about her favourite makeup 
looks, she said: 'I am a huge fan of the smoky eye but I am loving 
rocking a serious pop of colour on the lip, like a bright pink, at the 
moment.'

To give her skin it's 
beautiful glow, she swears by Benefit's Hoola bronzing powder and swipes
 some YSL concealer under her eyes to beat the bags.

She also makes sure she keeps in shape by practicing yoga and circuit training- even when she is on the road.

'I'm
 very active. Even when I am in my hotel room whilst travelling I do 
five exercises, 15-20 reps of each exercise, five times in a row, which 
only takes twenty minutes.'

Jessica Lowndes is the face of the new Lipsy London Glam fragrance. £25 for 50ml and is available at lipsy.co.uk and in Lipsy and Boots stores nationwide.
