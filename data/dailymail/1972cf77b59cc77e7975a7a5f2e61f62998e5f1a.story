Hillary Clinton has not yet finished her latest book which will play an important role in her expected presidential race.

'It’s a bit of a struggle to get it done...She is not necessarily a natural writer,' one anonymous friend told The Washington Post.

Another reason she is reportedly having trouble completing the book about her time as Secretary of State is the fact that she is well aware of the backlash that will come from Republicans.

Some of Mitt Romney's former aides have already formed a group with a team dedicated to countering any claims she makes in the book, which does not yet have a release date but is expected sometime this summer.

Tense moment: The killing of Osama bin Laden (pictured) and the Arab Spring are two of the main accomplishments that are expected to be included in her book, which will be published sometime this summer

Her advance payment for the book has not been released, but her first memoir, which was also published by Simon & Schuster, netted her $8million in 2000.

Republican operative Tim Miller is one of the two heads of the group, America Rising, and he said that Mrs Clinton is going to have trouble defining her time in office.

'The challenge for her with this book is to highlight a tangible accomplishment that voters can identify,' Mr Miller told the paper.

Other Republicans have also helped that effort, as they have been trashing her time at state- particularly over the handling of the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi- largely because she is the unabashed frontrunner for the Democrats in 2016, and likely because early polls show that there is no current Republican candidate who could beat her.

Critical: One of the most hotly-anticipated portions of the book will come when she describes how she and the Obama administration handled the attack on the American consulate in Libya

Under scrutiny: Republicans have already made an opposition team to 'correct' any assertions she makes about Benghazi and other hot-button issues in her upcoming book

'It’s almost becoming a kind of conventional wisdom that there were minimal accomplishments,' one unidentified friend of Clinton's told The Washington Post, showing what damage the Republican offensive is doing to her legacy.

The knocks against Mrs Clinton and her time as the head of the State Department comes in contrast to the high praise she was being given this time last year as she left the post, which was then taken over by John Kerry.

Her popularity was at an all-time high when she left the State Department but now that Mr Kerry is in office, he is the one earning praise for his work on issues like Iranian sanctions.

Though his supporters admitted that much of his success was based on the groundwork that she laid out during her term, they are still allegedly concerned that her book will take the spotlight away from Kerry and back to her.

Building relationships: Mrs Clinton, who visited 112 countries as Secretary of State, made inroads at many including in Myanmar where she met with pro-democracy opposition leader Aung San Sulu Kyi (pictured in December 2011)

That said, most Democrats are on her side in the matter, as her loyal band of defenders have created their own group of researchers and fact-checkers to debunk any claims that the Republicans make about alleged falsehoods in her book.

Others said that she dedicated much of her time in December and January to writing the book- with the help of speechwriters Dan Schwerin and Ted Widmer and research assistant Ethan Gelber.

Her other close advisors, like Huma Abedin, Maggie Williams and Melanne Verveer, are all thought to be working as sounding boards as well, The Post reported.

'She’s very animated about it,' former congresswoman Ellen Tauscher said of Mrs Clinton's book.

'This is the first time in a very long time that she gets to talk about important, weighty things as she thinks of them, unencumbered by the responsibilities of office or serving in the administration.

'It’s almost like this is Hillary unencumbered.'
