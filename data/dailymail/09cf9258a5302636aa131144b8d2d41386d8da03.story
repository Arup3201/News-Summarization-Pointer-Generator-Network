Southampton's famed academy continues to produce young players of Premier League quality and on Saturday they gave a full debut to another 18-year-old.

Jake Hesketh came on against Manchester United last Monday for his top-flight bow and sufficiently impressed Saints manager Ronald Koeman to be given a starting spot against Burnley on Saturday.

Unfortunately for Hesketh his full debut lasted only 32 minutes as he came off injured after a strong tackle from Michael Keane.

That being said, however, there are high hopes for the attacking midfielder at St Mary's. Here, Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about Southampton's latest young star.

Why does his name sound familiar?

Hesketh scored a brilliant goal - reminiscent of Matt Le Tissier's famous 1993 strike against Newcastle - in Southampton's 7-0 FA Youth Cup thumping of Portsmouth last December.

Hesketh, who scored twice and set up another two in the rout, chips the ball over Jack Whatmough's head before lashing it home.

He was an unused substitute against Aston Villa and Manchester City before finally getting his chance against United.

So, what kind of player is he?

'He is used to playing between the lines, he's fast, he's left, right-footed and a player with a future,' said Koeman after the United game, adding: 'He's doing well, he's a talent. He's improving.'

He is a No 10 similar in style to former Saint Adam Lallana, with an ability to find a pass and run at defenders.

Hesketh also has an eye for goal, finishing top scorer for the Under 18s with 13 last season.

Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale, Liverpool's Adam Lallana and Arsenal duo Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are just some of the names who have progressed through Southampton's academy.

Former Saints left back Luke Shaw sealed a £30million move to Manchester United in June after impressing at St Mary's, while Calum Chambers joined Arsenal for £12m.

So, will we see more of him this season?

Hesketh's performances for Saints' youth teams last season saw him voted Scholar of the Season, which was previously won by James Ward-Prowse, who has gone on to establish himself as a first-team regular.

He was also rewarded with a three-year contract in May - a sign of the club's faith in him.

Hesketh is expected to miss his the Capital One Cup clash at Sheffield United but could feature at the weekend against Everton. Koeman certainly seems to be a fan and is committed to Southampton's policy of giving young players a chance.

Morgan Schneiderlin will return from injury in the next few weeks and Jack Cork some time next year, but until then - injury permitting - Hesketh should continue in the first team.

So, what type of personality is he?

Hesketh is said to be a determined, focused young man – who isn’t letting his rapid rise go to his head. ‘At the start of the year I was playing youth football and now I've made my debut against United in the Premiership,’ Hesketh told the Southern Daily Echo.

‘When the season started my main goal was to cement a place in the Under 21s. I did that, then got a few sessions with the first team. It's gone quite quick. I'm really proud, it hasn't sunk in yet.’

And what about England?

Hesketh was called up to train with England's U18s in January but is yet to make his debut for his country at any level. Considering recent events, however, that may well change in the new year.
