The Colorado high school gunman scrawled messages on his forearm indicating five areas of the campus he intended to attack, before adding in Latin: 'The die has been cast.'

The chilling messages were found written on Karl Pierson's arm in permanent marker after he headed to Arapahoe High School on Friday, shot a fellow student in the head and took his own life.

Authorities today revealed that the letters and numbers on the 18-year-old's arm referred to specific classrooms located near the school's library, 
where he Pierson reportedly planned to target librarian and 
debate coach Tracy Murphy.

The notes added: 'Alea iacta est' - Latin for 'The die has been cast.' The phrase, said by Julius Caesar before leading his army into Italy, means that a situation has passed a point of no return.

Gunman: Karl Pierson, 18, scrawled 5 locations at Arapahoe High School on his arm before heading there on Friday morning, allegedly to target the school librarian. He shot one student and took his own life

'The letters/numbers written on the shooter's arm is an indicator to investigators of the shooter's plan,' Sheriff Grayson Robinson wrote in a news release on Tuesday, the Denver Post reported.

He added investigators hope to determine the relevance of the room list 'while closely evaluating if the occupants of those classrooms may have also been targeted for harm by the shooter'.

The new information came as staff members prepared to return to the school to gather their belongings on Wednesday ahead of the holiday break.

Students will be allowed to do the same on Thursday, but classes will not resume until the new year.

Pierson's victim, 17-year-old Claire Davis remains in a coma in critical but stable condition after being shot in the head by the pump-action shotgun Pierson had legally purchased a week earlier.

Intentions: He had also written 'The die has been cast' in Latin on his arm - a phrase used by Julius Caesar which means that a situation has passed a point of no return

Police have said that the teenager was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Candlelit vigils have been held outside the school, where a large sign reads: 'Pray 4 Claire'.

Her parents released a statement on Facebook saying their daughter remains in a coma.

'The first responders got Claire to 
the right place, at the right time, and the doctors and hospital staff 
are doing a wonderful job taking care of her. We appreciate your 
continued good thoughts and prayers, and will provide updates as her 
condition improves.

'We 
again ask that you respect our wishes for privacy, and refrain from 
contacting us, our extended family, or Claire's friends and schoolmates,
 as we want to ensure that only accurate information about Claire is 
shared,' read the statement.

On Monday, Pierson's parents, Barbara and Mick, issued a statement today saying that they could not fathom their son's actions.

Critical condition: Claire Davis, 17, was shot by Arapahoe senior Karl Pierson

Prayers: A makeshift tribute site outside the school bears the name of the severely wounded student

Vigil: Hundreds of Arapahoe High School students gathered for a candlelight vigil Saturday night

It read: 'We are shattered by 
the tragic events that took place on Friday at Arapahoe High School. Our
 thoughts and prayers are with Claire Davis and her family.

'They, and 
she, have suffered unimaginably, and we pray for her full recovery. We 
also pray for the entire Arapahoe High School community, as we know your
 lives are forever changed by this horrific event.'

They added: 'As
 parents, we loved our son Karl dearly and we are devastated by what 
happened Friday. We cannot begin to understand why Karl did what he did.
 We ask for privacy during this unthinkably difficult time and hope that
 you will respect our need for time to grieve.'

Pierson
 died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, a coroner confirmed
 after he entered the school with the gun, straps of ammunition, a 
machete and three Molotov cocktails.
