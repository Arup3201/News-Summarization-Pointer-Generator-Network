When Michael McTigue returns home after a hard day’s work, he opens his front door and steps back more than 70 years.

For the 45-year-old bus driver is a one-man time-warp from the 1930s. His clothes and semi-detached home are all in keeping with his obsession with Britain on the eve of World War II.

A vintage telephone stands on the hall 
table beside an exquisite art deco lamp, just a foretaste to the living 
room that’s packed with mirrors, clocks, ornaments and picture frames 
from the era.

All mod cons: Left; a dial telephone would have been the latest thing 
and the lamp the height of fashion and There’s a copy of his favourite 
paper on the chair and right; a jumble of 1930s wooden-shafted golf 
clubs, straw boaters, a metal RAF case, leather suitcases . . . and even
a banjo

Mr McTigue is never seen wearing anything out of keeping with his favourite era — except in the cab of his bus. He doesn’t own a washing machine and instead laborious scrubs his clothes outside in a dolly tub then squeezes them through a mangle. His Hoover dates from 1938.

‘I’m really a time traveller who lost his way,’ he says. ‘But I’m 45, so it’s too late to change now! I just love the era, it was a much simpler time.’

Mr McTigue’s home, in Riddleton, West Yorks, was unmodernised when he bought it seven years ago — the couple who had owned it since it was built in 1936 had lived there for more than 50 years. 

Since then he has set about collecting suitable antiques, old newspapers and knick-knacks from car-boot sales.

He
says: ‘My clothes are from the era, too. But as I’m 6ft 4in I’ve had to
get most of them tailor-made using authentic materials, as there 
weren’t many people my height in the 1930s,’ he explains.

Squeezy does it: Hand-scrubbed clothes are wrung through the mangle before being hung out to dry

Mr McTigue’s favourite period is 1939 and the early months of the war. He and a group of fellow enthusiasts, including neighbour Pam Robinson, gather for soirees and even stage re-enactments of Home Guard exercises.

Antique wirelesses and gramophones are dotted about the house, playing 78s by Thirties bandleaders such as Geraldo and Ambrose.

Mr McTigue does, however, have a refrigerator and a television — albeit a black-and-white model made in 1947.

‘People think I’m a lunatic, but it’s just my passion,’ he adds.

Full rations: The store cupboard, left, is packed with vintage bottles, 
tins and even dried peas. Names include Brasso, Turnwright’s Toffee, 
Luaka Tea, Oxo and Mansion polish. And right, an air raid warden's 
outfit hangs on the landing near a Bakelite radio ideal for tuning into 
Churchill's speeches

And so to bed: A candlewick bedspread (no duvet) on the heavy carved dark wooden bedstead
