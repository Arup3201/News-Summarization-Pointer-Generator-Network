England were warned they would be ‘foolish’ not to consider Kevin Pietersen for an Ashes Test return — by an Aussie.

Pietersen, 34, signed a contract with Surrey on Wednesday to play county cricket after IPL side Sunrisers Hyderabad agreed to release him from the majority of his contract.

Sunrisers coach Tom Moody, a former Aussie Test star who also played for Worcestershire, admires Pietersen’s bid to relaunch his England career.

He said: ‘There’s a lot of water that has to pass under the bridge first, and that includes him showing he’s going to be regularly fit for long periods of time. He also needs to prove his form.

‘If you put those two things together, I think England would be foolish not to consider him as a genuine option. You can’t help but admire his motivation to try to scale Everest again in Test cricket.’

Pietersen was sacked by England following the 2013-14 Ashes defeat but has been tempted back to Surrey after incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted he could return to the Test arena by scoring heavily in county cricket.

Moody, whose Sunrisers will get Pietersen back if they reach the IPL knockout stage, anticipates a successful return to The Oval for Pietersen.

‘I think there is a small chance,’ he said of a Test recall. ‘But I think that’s enough to motivate him.

‘He’s got an agenda — to score as many runs as he can to make it near-on impossible for the selectors to ignore him.

Surrey’s director of cricket Alec Stewart is happy to welcome back the batsman on a contract initially for Championship cricket which could evolve during the season.

Stewart said: ‘He has ambitions to play for England — and to do that, or even be considered, he has to score big runs.

‘That’s why we’ve signed him (so that) he gets those hundreds, those double-hundreds. After that, it’s down to the selectors.’

Pietersen, who will donate his Surrey wages to his charitable foundation, insists he will have no problem working with England captain Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores.

Pietersen started the year by playing more short form cricket for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash

‘Even if this does not work out and I do not get back in the England team, I will at least end my career knowing I gave it another shot,’ Pietersen said in his Daily Telegraph column.

‘I would kick myself for a long time if I walked away now, without having a go. All I am looking for is a fair opportunity to play for England again. I just want a blank sheet of paper, and to be judged on merit.

‘I will be meeting Mr Graves face to face. I think he is open to discussing drawing a line in the sand in terms of what’s gone on.’
