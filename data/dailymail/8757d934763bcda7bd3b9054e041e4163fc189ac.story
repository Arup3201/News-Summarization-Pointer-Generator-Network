It was business as usual for Leo Messi as he scored a double on the first day of the season for the fourth consecutive campaign. Barcelona won their first game 3-0 against Elche despite Javier Mascherano’s red card just before the break.

Messi’s characteristic brace was achieved without the suspended Luis Suarez and the injured Neymar but he had more than enough help from Madrid born youngster Munir El Hadaddi. The young striker will not be 19 until September 1 but already has Barça fans predicting a big future – if he can stay in the side when Neymar and Suarez return.

Barcelona have now scored 26 goals in their last six opening matches and not since 2008 have they been beaten on the opening day. That front three of Munir, Rafinha and Messi was a clean sweep for the club’s La Masia youth academy as Barcelona kicked-off the season with the entire bench and six of the starters products of its youth system.

After just five minutes the three forwards combined with Munir playing in Messi who set up Rafinha only for him take too many touches and lose possession.

Munir hit the post on 22 minutes as Elche began to creak at the back with Messi carrying on from his Gamper trophy performance against Mexican side FC Leon in Barça’s last pre-season friendly. 

Andres Iniesta crashed a shot on to the crossbar on the half hour and Messi was then put through by Ivan Rakitic and lobbed Przemyslaw Tyton but the flag had been raised.

Munir’s decision making is what makes him stand out but on 40 minutes he made the wrong choice when put through by Messi. He should have shot but tried to find Rafinha and gave the ball away.

Barcelona finally got themselves in front four minutes before the break when Damian’s poor clearance went straight to Sergi Busquets and his excellent first time pass to the edge of the area played in Messi who spun and drilled his shot past Tyton for his first goal of the new season. He also scored the first goal of the campaign in 2008 and 2010 and Barcelona won the Champions League in both seasons.

Elche were given some hope just before half time when Garry Rodriguez broke away for the visitors and cut across Javier Mascherano who was scampering back to clear the danger. Rodriguez tumbled as the Argentine clipped him and referee Fernando Teixeira pulled out the red card.

Barcelona brought central defender Marc Bartra on at the start of the second half for Rafinha switching to a 4-3-2 formation but any sense that Elche would come back into the game evaporated when with his first shot on target in the second half Munir found the back of the net.

Croatian midfielder Rakitic who must fill Xavi’s boots this season in midfield for Barcelona played a pass that the former Spain captain would have been proud of and with the outside of his left boot Munir made it 2-0.

Messi made it three on 63 minutes when Alves rolled the ball across the line of the penalty area and he jigged around three white-shirted Elche defenders to make enough space for himself to shoot into the far corner.

Pedro replaced Munir on 66 minutes as Elche failed to test Barcelona’s Claudio Bravo on his home debut. Rodrgiuez wayward cross shot was typical of the visitors no-show in attack.

At the other Pedro broke away and when fed by Messi drew a save from Tyton but Barcelona could not add to their lead. It was a more than satisfactory start for Luis Enrique. Debutants Munir and Rakitic had both impressed and Messi had shown that with the weight of World Cup expectation lifted from his shoulders this season he seems well on the way to getting back to his very best.
