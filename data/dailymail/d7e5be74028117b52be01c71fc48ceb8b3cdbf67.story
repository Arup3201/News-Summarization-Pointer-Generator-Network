The smash took place on Antalya- Isparta highway in the south of the country on Sunday. At around 5.45am the passenger bus went out of control and rolled off the road

It is believed that the bus had been taking part in a tour and two other buses participating in the same tour returned to Afyonkarahisar after the accident.

The accident is the worst to have occurred in Turkey this summer - but the area is a well known accident blackspot in the winter, as ice covered the road surfaces.

A number of buses are said to have caught fire earlier this season.

Tours often take place during the night, avoiding both heat and traffic.
