Bravo is trying out two new women for their Real Housewives of Atlanta franchise. The TV network has cast actress/singer Demetria McKinney and model/host Claudia Jordan as what they call 'B characters,' MailOnline has learned.

Both women will shoot scenes with the principal cast members -- NeNe Leakes, Phaedra Parks, Kandi Burruss, Cynthia Bailey, Kenya Moore and Porsha Williams -- and the network will wait to see how the audience responds to them before determining if they'll make them full-time cast members.

They don't hail from Georgia and Claudia just moved to Atlanta from Los Angeles. Both are unmarried.

B list: It will be up to RHOA audiences to determine  if Demetria McKinney and Claudia Jordan make the A team and join the show permanently

Georgia peaches: Will the regular cast of RHOA welcome the new members...or will the sparks fly?

McKinney, 32, is a single mom of a 12-year-old son and former star of Tyler Perry's sitcom House of Payne. Born in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, McKinney has been in a long-term relationship with former Tyler Perry Studios executive Roger Bobb. 

She has also appeared on shows like Necessary Roughness, The Rickey Smiley Show and Boulevard West, and is working on her first CD. She released a single and music video for a song called  100.

'Bravo is really high on her. She's likeable, works well with the other ladies and is intriguing without contrived drama,' a source close to the network tells MailOnline.  'She has wealth, loves fashion and fine things, and is in a real relationship with a high-powered entertainment executive.

'Bravo thinks if NeNe leaves the show after this season she could be the perfect replacement.'

NeNe's contract - worth a coll $1m -is up after this season and she's not expected to renew. She has a development deal for a talk show with Debmar-Mercury and wants to focus on acting.

'NeNe's contract is up after this season and she's made it clear she's ready to move on. Her focus is really more centered on her acting work and developing the talk show,' the source told MailOnline.Jordan, 41, is a former The Price is Right and Deal or No Deal model who recently moved to Atlanta to co-host the Rickey Smiley Morning Show syndicated radio program. 

She doesn't have children and is not in a serious relationship. Most recently, the Providence, Rhode Island-bred host appeared on Donald Trump's "Celebrity Apprentice All Stars" where she had a very ugly spat with reality TV vixen Omarosa Manigault.

'Claudia desperately wants to be on this show despite that fact that she doesn't remotely fit the Housewives' format, the source explained. 'She came on the show as a friend of Kenya's but hasn't meshed that well with the others.

'She dresses like a teenage party girl and isn't into fine, southern living, so producers aren't sure that viewers will really connect with her or find her likable.'

Critics of the franchise have complained the lack of Southern roots for some of the Housewives and Demetria and Claudia would not be the first.Cynthia Bailey, though married, moved from New York City to join the show. Kenya 
Moore flies in from LA to tape & has no man; Kandi Burruss wasn't 
married her first 5 seasons; Kim Zolciak was an unmarried mistress for 
her first few seasons.

In the past, Real Housewives of Atlanta producers have completely edited B characters from the show if they don't like the final outcome of their scenes with the principle cast members.

Both Porsha Williams and Kenya Moore began as B Characters who were made permanent. Last season, Natalie Macklin, wife of R&B singer Christopher Williams, and Mynique Smith, wife former NFL player Chuck Smith, are examples of two who didn't make it through they appeared in a few episodes.

Production on RHOA began last month. As of now, it is expected both ladies will be seen when the show returns in the fall -- it's just too soon to determine if they will ultimately hold the peach.
