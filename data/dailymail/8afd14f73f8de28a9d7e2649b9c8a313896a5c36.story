It may be the unofficial start to the American summer but this Memorial Day weekend, you can forget the beach or the backyard BBQ, this weekend the weather is expected to feel more like Veterans Day.

Parts of the northeastern United States are expected to feel more like winter and forecasters have have suggested snow could be possible in some parts of northern Maine, New York, New Hampshire and Vermont.

New England will be experiencing some wintry weather across the weekend, with snowfall at higher elevations on Sunday night.

Abysmal: Snow in the northeast and strong storms across much of the country - hardly summer-like weather is it?

Wrap up: Put away the shorts and t-shirts and get out that winter coat!

Snow was reported in western parts of New York State, south of Buffalo and several viewers on the Facebook Pennsylvania Storm Chasers also reported seeing snowflakes.

Snow and frost anywhere in the Northeast sounds rare for late May, but it has happened before.

Flakes fell in Maine in June 2009 and up to 10 inches in New England on May 26th 1967.

The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for parts of Massachusetts and Texas on Friday as much of the country continued to be hit by miserable weather.

One Maine meteorologist, Keith Carson of WCSH Portland, sounded sheepish. 'Accumulation will be light but..ummm...it's Memorial Day so we shouldn't even be having this conversation,' he wrote.

The Tri-State area was also hit by heavy rainfall and thunderstorms throughout the night.

Unfortunately I don’t have good news on the weather front said Ross Dickman, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service.

'It’s not going to be a beach day on Saturday. We’re going to have rain showers extending into the weekend with a cold northeasterly wind. Temperatures may not get out of the mid-to-upper 50s.'

All is not lost for those looking to salvage the holiday weekend. Conditions should begin to clear on Sunday and Memorial Day is shaping up to be just about perfect.

Dickman said temperatures should rebound into the upper 70s under sunny skies by the time Monday afternoon arrives.
