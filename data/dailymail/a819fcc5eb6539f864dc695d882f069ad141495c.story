A no-fly' zone has been put in place over Wimbledon's All England tennis club, for the first time in 10 years.

The air exclusion zone was last used in 2002 following the September 11 terror attacks in New York the previous year.

Police said the decision to reinstate it follows complaints from The All England Club about noise. However they said a no fly zone would certainly 'help' with security.

Sniffing out any trouble: A police officer watches as a sniffer dog inspect the courts ahead of the first day at the Wimbledon Championships in London

Prepared: A line of security guards waits to let the crowds into the All England Tennis Club at SW19

The zone extends 500ft high and has a 
0.75 nautical mile perimeter, Superintendent Pete Dobson, from the 
Metropolitan Police, told a briefing.

He said: 'We have had it in previous 
years although we did not have it last year, there was some noise 
nuisance from a number of aircraft.

'It’s not been driven by security but of course it does help.'

'You just don’t want strange aircraft 
flying overhead if you can avoid it so from a security point of view it 
helps but it was not the driver.'

Mr Dobson said he was aware the 
world’s eyes are on London - Wimbledon follows the Queen’s Diamond 
Jubilee and comes just weeks before the Olympics tennis tournament is 
hosted at the same venue.

Measures: Plain-clothes officers are at the south-west London club, while each person¿s bag is searched as they enter

He said: 'I am acutely aware that if 
somebody was to do something untoward here it could well have a knock-on
effect on the Olympics.

Police numbers at the grand slam have 
been increased this year, but Mr Dobson would not reveal how many 
officers are deployed, and how many more are being used this year, but 
said the increase was 'appropriate'.

Police are using anti-social behaviour
legislation to help disperse gangs of people - including ticket touts -
while they also have a list of banned faces who will not be allowed in.

'There are a number of individuals 
that have been banned by the club and there are a number of individuals 
of interest that have been circulated by the WTA (Women’s Tennis 
Association).

'Some of those are stalkers of 
players, some of them are coaches that have been dismissed, those sorts 
of things where there have been domestic issues within the tennis world 
and as a result they are just not welcome at these sorts of events.'

Threat: (left) Venus Williams and (right) Maria Sharapova are among dozens of players to have been targetted by stalkers in the past. Police say they are monitoring 'generic threats' against players

Police numbers at the tournament have been increased this year, but a spokesman would not reveal exactly how many officers are deployed

He said no specific players have 
approached the police or club with specific threats this year, but there
are “generic threats” police are monitoring.

Last year anti-capitalist protesters 
targeted the tournament, Mr Dobson said, adding that they were not aware
of any politically-motivated protests planned for this year, although 
'two weeks is a long time'.

Plain-clothes officers are at the south-west London club, while each person’s bag is searched as they enter.

Some members of the team in charge of 
the policing operation at Wimbledon will be helping with the security 
operation during the Olympics, Mr Dobson said, but it will look

'totally different' as it is part of a much larger event.

He added: 'We are always looking to 
improve our security plan so we do review it and we do make some 
tactical changes so we can defeat anyone who is trying to do a hostile 
reconnaissance.

'The mere fact that the Olympics are 
here also means that we have been able to benefit from wider security 
provisions and we use that to review our plans.'
