Residents in the Pocono Mountains were today ordered to stay inside after police reportedly exchanged gunfire with a survivalist fugitive who shot dead a state trooper last week.

Donning bulletproof vests, officers have hunkered down in the wooded Canadensis neighborhoood where Eric Frien, one of the FBI's most wanted men, lived with his parents.

They have told locals in the townships of Price and Barrett to remain inside, while others have been asked not to travel to the area due to heavy police activity. Those who had been kept away from the area were allowed to return to their homes this morning, but told to shelter in place.

However, around 20 people who couldn't get back to their homes were required to take refuge at the Barrett Township firehouse, said township supervisor Ralph Megliola.

This morning, roads remained closed as police carrying heavy rifles intensified their search for 31-year-old Frein following a long night that included gunshots. An unmarked helicopter was heard flying overhead, its lights off.

After daybreak, two FBI agents in a black SUV donned tactical gear before heading toward the search area.

 Authorities will not say whether they believe they have Frein surrounded. Their last communication came shortly after 9pm yesterday when a spokeswoman asked the media to relocate at a staging area further away from the scene.

Shots were fired in the area around 6:40 p.m. Friday, a Monroe County 911 dispatcher said. An official told CNN there were gunshots between police and 'an individual believed to be Frein,' the channel said. 

The source also said police were outside where someone got inside a home using forced entry. 

Today, residents Al and Debbie Mundy said they had to spent the night in their pickup after going out for groceries yesterday evening.

When they got to the end of the road, a state trooper told them they would not be permitted back into the neighborhood, they said.

'They would not let us turn around to go a quarter-mile back to our house,' said Mr Mundy.

Meanwhile, Canadensis resident Richard Barry told of how he did not return home from work in time before the roadblocks went up.

He said that family members who were at home had told him police were going through their yard and the dog was barking.

'I'm hoping that sooner or later he (Frein) just says "I give up. You win",' Mr Barry added.

Shelter: The Pennsylvania State Police today asked all residents of Barrett and Price townships (pictured) to continue to shelter inside. The force told locals to remain away from windows or openings to the outside

As many as 200 officers at a time are trying to flush out Frein. Authorities are hoping to catch the gunman they allege opened fire on a state police barracks a week ago, killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounding a second trooper. 

Police had previously been focusing their search on tens of thousands of acres of undisturbed forest that offered the self-taught survivalist ample opportunity to hide.

But in the current search, authorities believe Frein is hiding in the patch of forest near his hometown of Canadensis and the state police barracks in Blooming Grove where authorities say he killed Dickson and wounded Trooper Alex Douglass.

Police have said Frein nurses an unspecified grudge against law enforcement and government and consider it unlikely he will target the public.

Pennsylvania State Police told Fox29 reporter Dave Kinchen that Frein may be carrying two firearms. 

Active: Frein, who has participated in Cold War military reenactments, is part of a group called Eastern Wolves

Authorities are seen in the search for Eric Frein 

A '[b]ig tow truck' and '[t]hree police vehicles' drove away from the area late Friday evening, Peter Cameron of The Times Tribune reported.

ABC News reported Frein has participated in Cold War military reenactments and is a member of a group called Eastern Wolves. 

Reenactor Roman Kamensky told the news site 'If he's re-enacting anyone, it's Rambo from the very first movie,' referencing the 1982 film 'First Blood.' 

'He put a bad light on us,' Kamensky also said. 'We respect cops, we don't try to kill cops.'

Kamensky explained to ABC News 'We attended the same events. Red Alliance is a global [military simulation] community, so when you find someone in the Tri-state area, you try to meet up.'

Speaking about Eastern Wolves, Kamensky said 'From what I've seen, they haven't been doing much. Most of them are just casual guys from Pennsylvania. They have some land over there. They host their events and locals come out and they just play Airsoft.' 

Where is he? The FBI shared Frein's image in New York City's Times Square

In a news conference, Lt. Col. George Bevins said 'Information has been received that Frein currently has his head shaved tightly on both sides with long hair on top.'

'It's wider than a mohawk on top,' Bevins said. 'His hairstyle is completely different from the hairstyle that Frein has worn for years. Investigators believe that this change was made as part of the mental preparation to commit this cowardly act.'

Eastern Wolves member Stephen D'Arcangelo told NBC News 'That stuff about wanting to commit mass murder and kill cops? I never heard him say anything like that.'

'With the mohawk thing and the military uniform, they're making him sound like Travis Bickle from "Taxi Driver" and he wasn't that dude,' he also said.

Police say they are methodically eliminating places where Frein could take refuge, including hunting cabins, campsites and vacation homes in the Pocono Mountains.

Have you seen me? A wanted poster for Frein is seen in a Philadelphia convenience store 

It's difficult. The terrain in this area of Pennsylvania is so impenetrable in spots that police choppers can't see through the forest canopy. The suspect also has his pick of places to break into and steal food. Pike County alone boasts more than 14,000 seasonal or recreational homes.

NBC News reported that Frein was in jail for three months after failing to appear for his own trial, stemming from his alleged theft of relics from World War Two.

'He was locked up until he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to time served and restitution,' the news site said.

Frein, publicly identified as a suspect Tuesday, is already drawing comparisons to Eric Rudolph, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bomber who eluded authorities for years in the woods of western North Carolina.

Like Frein, Rudolph was described as an anti-government survivalist who lived off the land, but authorities say one of his earliest moves after going on the run in 1998 was to swipe a six-month supply of food and a pickup truck from a neighbor's house. He left the man $500. 

Frein's sister Tiffany said 'He did something messed up, but he's still a human and he has feelings' to NBC News Wednesday.

'We're not trying to protect him,' she also said. 'He has to suffer the consequences. But he's still our family. I don't know where he is or what he's doing. I hope it's a big misunderstanding.'

The FBI has posted his image in Times Square and says there is a $100,000 information reward.

In a release, the agency said 'Frein is known to be a heavy smoker, a weapons enthusiast, and a survivalist. He claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa, and he has studied Russian and Serbian languages. He may have shaved his head on both sides and have long hair on top. 

'He was last seen with no facial hair and was wearing a brown and gold windbreaker, khaki shorts, and sneakers. He was carrying a dark green backpack with black trim. Frein has ties to the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, including the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York.'
