Members of an Oxford University drinking society were branded ‘repugnant and sexist’ yesterday for organising a pub crawl in which girls dressed as foxes have to ‘evade mauling’.

The Black Cygnets Society at St Hugh’s College sent invitations to the female first-year students its members consider to be the most attractive.

The ‘Fox Hunt’ event involves male students, or ‘Huntsmen’, dressed in red jackets chasing the women ‘Foxes’ dressed in short skirts and fox ears.

Invite: An Oxford University drinking club has been branded 'repugnant, sexist and secretive' after organising a 'fox hunt' through the city with girls trying to avoid a huntsman's 'mauling'

An emergency meeting of St Hugh's JCR student body this week condemned the hunt after a motion proposed by Carenza Harvey (above), a first-year invited to be a 'Fox'

The invitation said: ‘To evade mauling, Foxes must pass the following obstacles with Huntsmen in pursuit’, then lists nine pubs they must visit and the drinks they must consume.

The ‘Foxes’ have to drink hot punch, cider, white wine, red wine, Smirnoff Ice, gin and tonic and sambuca, before arriving at a tenth and final bar called Wahoo, referred to in the printed invitations as ‘Wahoo Foxhole’.

St Hugh’s was founded in 1886 as a women’s college and did not accept men until 1986. Graduates include Home Secretary Theresa May and Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

The college’s principal, Dame Elish Angiolini, said yesterday: ‘This college was founded to secure equality  for women.

‘We are utterly appalled that any member of our community would consider belonging to, or participating in, this repugnant, sexist and secretive group.

‘Any student involved in the distribution of material of this kind, or participation in any of this group’s activities, will be subject to the college’s disciplinary procedures.’

The Black Cygnets were banned from college premises in 2008 after an outcry, but reorganised the annual ‘Fox Hunt’ in 2011 in the college bar, resulting in one student being banned from the college bar and fined.

Last year the society’s members were warned that strong action would be taken against them if they repeated the event outside the college and it resulted in a complaint from the public or the police.

This year’s event is due to start from the back gate of the college tonight at 7.30pm for, according to the invitation, ‘the Huntsmen to pick up the scent’.

An emergency meeting of St Hugh’s JCR student body this week condemned the hunt after a motion proposed by Carenza Harvey, a first-year invited to be a ‘Fox’.

The Black Cygnets are a drinking society at St Hugh's College,Oxford. They were officially banned in 2008

She said: ‘The language was inherently sexist and offensive. The girls who are invited are picked purely on their looks, which creates a very destructive and dangerous atmosphere.

‘The dress code unavoidably and unashamedly generated a sexist and demeaning predatory feel to the evening. It also, disturbingly, creates the impression that women are only animals, to be objectified, while the men hold the upper hand as humans.’

The motion supporting the ‘college in all of their inquiries to render effective the ban on the Black Cygnets’ was carried.

One student who attended a previous event said all the women were willing participants and did not have to turn up just because they were invited.
