At least 11 people were killed and 50 injured today in a pair of explosions in a crowded area of the southern Indian city of Hyderabad.

The bombs were attached to two bicycles about 150 meters (500 feet) apart in Dilsukh Nagar, a residential and commercial district.

'This is a dastardly attack, the guilty will not go unpunished,' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, who appealed to the public to remain calm.

Federal Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said eight people died in one explosion and three in the other. He spoke to reporters in New Delhi, the Indian capital.

The blasts occurred about two minutes apart outside a movie theater and a bus station, police said.

Television images showed the injured being taken to nearby hospitals.

The last major bomb attack in India was a September 2011 blast outside the high court in New Delhi that killed 13 people.

Federal Home Secretary R.K. Singh said
officials from the National Investigation Agency and commandos of the 
National Security Guards were leaving New Delhi for Hyderabad, the 
capital of Andhra Pradesh.

India has been in a state of alert 
since Mohammed Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri, was hanged in a New Delhi jail 
nearly two weeks ago. Guru had been convicted of involvement in a 2001 
attack on India's Parliament that killed 14 people including five 
gunmen.

Many in Indian-ruled Kashmir believe 
Guru did not receive a fair trial, and the secrecy with which the 
execution was carried out fueled anger in a region where anti-India 
sentiment runs deep.
