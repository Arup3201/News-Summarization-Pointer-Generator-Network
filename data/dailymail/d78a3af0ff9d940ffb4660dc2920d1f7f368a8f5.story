There will be no mail delivery on Saturdays and the U.S Postal Service could sell non-postal products if President Obama's newly unveiled plan to save the agency more than $20 billion goes ahead.

The plan would also involve refunding $6.9 billion the mail carrier says it overpaid into a federal retirement fund and restructuring a massive annual payment to prefund health benefits for retirees.

While Congressional lawmakers are in favour of a five-day mail delivery service, the proposals still could face opposition.

Republican Darrell Issa has refused to consider revamping the prepayment or returning retirement fund money.

Issa, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, has offered an amendment that he says brings the savings in his USPS bill to more than $10 billion per year through cuts and restructuring.

Lawmakers in Congress have already agreed on the need to overhaul the agency, but several bills take different approaches.

Issa's plan, which allows USPS to override contracts and cut the workforce, could spark arguments in Congress when a subcommittee takes up the bill on Wednesday.

The Postal Service has watched its core business of delivering mail plummet as consumers send email and pay bills online.

The agency has said it will be unable to deliver mail by the end of next summer if it does not downsize drastically.

"The administration recognizes the enormous value of the U.S. Postal Service to the nation's commerce and communications, as well as the urgent need for reform to ensure its future viability," a White House document states.

The Postal Service relies on revenue from stamps, packages and other services, not tax dollars, to fund its operations. The agency lost more than $3 billion last quarter.

The agency expects to default on the $5.5 billion retiree health payment due at the end of September unless Congress provides relief. Lawmakers have indicated they want to extend the due date for the payment.

Issa's bill would end Saturday mail and set up groups to close facilities and cut costs if the agency misses payments. The amendment doubles the amount the agency would have to save by closing processing facilities and phases out delivery to front-door mail slots.

The plan to rescue the ailing service, introduced alongside a deficit-reduction package, would refund the $6.9 million it claims it overpaid into a federal retirement fund.
