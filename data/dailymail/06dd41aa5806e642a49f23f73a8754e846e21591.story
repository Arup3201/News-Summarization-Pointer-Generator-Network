Forming a majestic gatehouse from Trafalgar Square to Buckingham Palace, it will certainly be able to offer rooms with a view.

After years housing civil servants’ dilapidated offices, Admiralty Arch, one of London’s best-known landmarks, is to become a luxury hotel, it was announced yesterday.

And with Rafael Serrano, the Spanish developer behind the glitzy Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge, heading the project, it should be eye-catching at the very least.

Majestic: Admiralty Arch, one of London's best-known landmarks, is to become a luxury hotel

Some critics have panned the Bulgari –
the most expensive place to stay in Britain, with even the cheapest 
rooms from £850 a night – for its ‘brash’ and ‘tasteless’ decor, dubbing
it the ‘Vulgari’.

Now Mr Serrano’s London-based firm 
Prime Investors Capital has bought Grade I-listed Admiralty Arch for 
£60million, there is talk of ‘subtle illuminations’ on the outside, and a
sumptuous ballroom and spa inside.

But at a press conference to unveil 
the sale yesterday, Mr Serrano was quick to stress that the 100-year-old
building’s period features will be painstakingly preserved as part of 
the deal.

When the arch’s sale was announced 
last year, it was contingent on the building being made accessible to 
the public for the first time, with a museum mooted as an option.

National celebrations: The building has been part of many celebrations, including the Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession this year, over the last century

Five-star luxury: Prime Investors Capital intends to convert the building into a five-star 100-bedroom hotel with royal and presidential suites, a ballroom, spa and fine dining restaurant

Turning it into a five-star hotel will inevitably invite criticism that the arch will be accessible only to the super-rich.

Mr Serrano said the hotel should 
attract 50,000 guests a year in its 100 guestrooms, with a further 
50,000 visiting its bars and restaurants, which will be open to the 
public.

The development will also create hundreds of jobs.

With nearby six-bedroom houses on the market for £30million, £60million might seem a snip.

But the deal is to restore the arch during a 99-year lease, a project which will probably cost hundreds of millions.

Spread over eight storeys, the 
147,300 sq ft building is not being used at present, is falling into 
disrepair and has £900,000-a-year running costs, which Cabinet Office 
Minister Francis Maude said amounted to a ‘tragic waste of an historic 
building’.

Affair: John Prescott and Tracey Temple at his private flat at Admiralty Arch, February, 2006

Royal history: Beefeaters march through the arch on Coronation Day in May 1937

Inside the arch: Used as the Cabinet Office headquarters, the public has rarely seen inside the building. Cabinet minister Francis Maude said the plans 'will bring this London landmark back to life'

'Great shame': In the 100 years since it opened, the building has had virtually no public access, including the south block staircase, but Mr Maude says that the Government wants to 'preserve it for future generations'

No decision has yet been made on what the hotel will be called or who will run it.

The team will liaise with the 
Government on the security implications, due to its sensitive position 
overlooking Whitehall and the Mall.

Buckingham Palace has been consulted, while the Government retains the freehold and still has the final say in its development.

The sale does not include Admiralty 
House, next door, which dates from 1788 and has provided 
grace-and-favour apartments for politicians including former deputy 
prime minister John Prescott.

Property investor Rafael Serrano is also behind the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge. Room prices start at £850 and that's before service charges, tips and refreshments

Ostentatious: The Bulgari is the UK's most expensive hotel. Despite this, it is almost always completely booked
