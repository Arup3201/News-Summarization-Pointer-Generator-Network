At first glance, it looks like any other bird gliding through the air.

However, it fact this groundbreaking gadget is actually a bionic bird controlled by an app.

It can fly upto 100m away from its owner (and their phone), and future versions will be fitted with an HD camera.

The bionic bird can fly for up to eight minutes on a single charge.

Made from foam, the Bionic Bird gets its power from a charger shaped like an egg, and a can fly for ten eight minute slots on a single charge.

The bird, currently at the prototype stage, would communicate via Bluetooth for a range of 100 meters (330 ft), and weighs eight grams.

The Bionic Bird uses sensors is the iPhone or iPad to control the bird, following its movements exactly.

Called the Bionic Bird, the French startup behind it has turned to crowdfunding to raise money for it.

 'Throughout history man has dreamed of flying,' the firm says.

'Today, Bionic Bird offers the opportunity to experience that extraordinary sensorial adventure: to fly like a bird.'

'Bionic Bird is going to take off,' its inventor Edwin Van Ruymbeke said.

 'Let the dream take flight!'

The company has experience building similar radio-controlled toys.

The 800 mAh portable charger can be refueled via a USB port in about an hour and doubles as a pedestal for the bird to sit on.

A free iPhone and iPad mini app can be downloaded to control the bird and comes with two control modes: both use touch control for the throttle, but the 'easy mode' uses the phone's accelerometer to steer the bird, while the 'hard mode' uses touch controls for the steering as well.

The inventors say that an Android version of the app will hit the Google Play store in February 2015, and will work as long as your device is Bluetooth 4 compatible.

According to the company, a pair of replacement wings is also included.  

You can pledge US$100 for a bird on Indiegogo.

If all goes to plan, the company says will be delivered by Christmas this year, and is it reaches its targets, ttretch goals include a way to dynamically control the angle of the tail for slower flight, stationary flight capabilities, and even an HD camera for live video feed back to your smartphone.

There is also a plan for a watch to control it, where where the commands will be 'linked to natural and intuitive gestures from a connected wrist band.'

The firm eventually hopes the bird will be able to hover like a hummingbird

The firm says it can fly indoors - and does not like bad weather. 

'Like all electronic devices, Bionic Bird does not like the rain and does not like to swim. Bionic Bird, unlike small helicopters, is stable in the wind. Its maximum speed is 10 knots, so the wind speed must be less. '
