The radiologists who saw these X-rays pop up on their screens must have struggled to keep a straight face when asking the patients what had happened.

They show unusual items medical staff around the world have found inside patients' rectums. 

They include a deodorant bottle, a pestle (which entered anus when the patient 'slipped while cooking Malaysian food'), a coffee jar and an orange.

The images have been shared by medical staff on Radiopaedia, an teaching and reference website founded by an Australian radiology student in 2005.

Although the examples seen below make for legitimate research and teaching material for radiologists, for others they serve as amusement, and for some, cautionary tales.

Bricks and mortar: This X-ray of a 40-year-old man reveals a pestle, which he says entered his rectum when he 'slipped while cooking Malaysian food'

Instant pain: This patient had self-inserted a jar of 'a well-known brand of instant coffee' with a number of pins stuck in the rubber inside of the lid

Each to their own: This patient appeared to have built his own sex-toy by screwing an empty tube of Berocca vitamins to the top of a spray canister and inserting it into his rectum

Not allowed to smile: The collection of X-rays show unusual items medical staff around the world have found inside patients' rectums, such as in this case - a bottle

No exit strategy: The doctor who treated this patient, who had inserted a vibrator into his anus, suggested that 'perhaps they should have a cord to strap to your ankle, like a surfboard'

Warning: This patient who inserted an eggplant, learned the hard way that 'once it's equator has passed the anal verge it has a tendency to scoot up up and away' 

'Educational': The images, such as this showing an orange inserted into rectum, have been shared by medical staff on Radiopaedia, a wiki for radiologists

This patient had inserted a bottle into anus, which when  extracted, 'proved to be a deodorant bottle'
