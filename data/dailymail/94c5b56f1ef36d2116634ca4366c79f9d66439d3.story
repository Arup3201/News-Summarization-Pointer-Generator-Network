Charged: Michael Lander, 40, will face court next month charged with lewd and lascivious battery of his student whom he brought to live with his family in 2008

A woman whose husband allegedly convinced her to adopt a 12-year-old
girl he is accused of sexually assaulting blames
herself for the abuse.

Former elementary school teacher Michael Lander will face court next month charged with lewd and lascivious battery of his student whom he brought to live with his family in 2008.

Michael's devastated wife Jennifer Lander said the alleged abuse has ruptured her family and that she constantly goes 'back and forth over how naive' she was to 'allow things to happen'.

'I can't imagine what the girl is going through. My intentions were to give the girl a stable family life and the entire thing completely backfired on me,' she told Tampa Bay Times.

'If i could change anything, I would change the amount of hurt, pain and anguish that has gone on in my family. If i could take it away from my children alone, I would take it away in a heartbeat.'

The Land O'Lakes, Florida, family's tragic story began in 2008 when Michael began sharing horrific stories about his fifth-grade student at Schrader Elementary with Jennifer.

Michael allegedly said the 12-year-old girl's mother was a drug-addicted stripper who had home schooled her.

The girl was same age as his stepdaughter - Jennifer's daughter - Autumn Boisvert.

Over time, the stories worsened. Michael said the girl's mother was on the brink of abandoning her, and suggested the couple look after the girl. He said it was her only chance and they owed it to her.

Even though money was tight - the couple already had two children with a third on the way - Jennifer agreed and the couple signed the temporary custody paperwork in March 2008.

The girl shared a room with Autumn, who embraced her.

'We were best friends, seriously,' Autumn, now 19, said.

'I kind of showed her how not to be so grown up. 
She wore lots of makeup...skimpy clothes.'

Devastated: Jennifer Lander claims her husband Michael was controlling. 'I've gone back and forth where I've blamed myself for being naive for allowing things to happen,' she said

Tragic: Jennifer Lander, pictured hugging her son, claims she found thigh-high stockings in her husband's bag after he returned from a trip with the girl. She called police but Michael said the girl wore the stockings because she was a cutter

However, life deteriorated for Jennifer.

The principal at Michael's school filed a letter of reprimand on March 10 detailing concerns about Michael's behavior toward the girl.

Even before the couple had taken in the 
girl, the principal had claimed she 'seemed unusually enamored' with Michael. Staff members also allegedly saw her run her finger down his arm and whisper in his ear.

Michael resigned four days later, telling Jennifer he quit 
because a vindictive assistant principal wanted him fired.

Soon after, Michael planned a trip to South Carolina to search for a new teaching job and said he would take Autumn and the girl.

Autumn pulled out at the last minute.

When Michael and the girl returned from the trip, Jennifer allegedly discovered thigh high stockings in his bag and called police.

Police left after Michael allegedly convinced them and his wife the girl wore stockings to cover self-inflicted cuts.

Jennifer believed him.

Early days: Michael and Jennifer Lander met in their early 20s, and Michael embraced his new love's five-month-old daughter, Autumn

In May, Jennifer found 'barely legal' porn on Michael's computer and, in a rage, smashed a lasagne tray on the floor.

The girl told her mother about the outburst, who then moved her back home.

That's when Michael allegedly confided in Autumn, then 13, about his illegal behavior.

'My dad asked me if we could talk about something serious and he brings me into my room, he sits on the corner of my bed, and I just kind of stand in the doorway. And he said, 'Do you think it's OK for two people to love each other despite age?' Autumn said.

The situation worsened over time - but Jennifer claimed she was under Michael's spell and believed his many lies.

Tampa Bay Times  reported Jennifer intercepted a phone call between Michael, who had picked up tutoring work, and the girl.

She claimed she heard her husband tell the girl they needed to 'get some tutoring done'.

The girl said: 'Yeah, then we can play.'

When Jennifer interrupted, asking what they would play, the startled girl responded: 'Like, Monopoly'.

Jennifer ripped the phone out of the wall, and Michael accused her of overreacting. She agreed she was.

'I want people to understand that there's more than one victim. I've  gone back and forth where I've blamed myself for being naive for allowing things to happen,' Jennifer said.

'But it's amazing how much control a person can have over your emotions and thoughts and feelings. For some reason, it feels like he has my soul.

'That doesn't mean I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but he has a part of me that I can't get back. I live in such a nice community, and I live in such a pretty house with really pretty things inside.'

Jennifer said Michael's attitude slowly improved when their son was born.

Heartbroken: Autumn, who said her 'heart hurts', claims her stepfather has sent her more than a hundred letters from prison

Confidante: Autumn said she was just 13 when her stepfather told her about his 'relationship' with his young student who was living with them

But on the day of his son's birth, Michael allegedly picked up the girl and took her home to watch movies with his children.

The next morning, Autumn allegedly saw the girl come out of her stepdad's bedroom, according to Tampa Bay Times.

'She told me she wants me to be her first,' Autumn recalled her stepdad telling her. 'I told her no.'

Just a few weeks later, the girl's mother called Jennifer saying she'd found sexually explicit emails.

When Jennifer confronted Michael, he fell to his knees saying it was blackmail and the girl's mother wanted money.

Jennifer said Michael convinced her that the girl might have put something incriminating on his computer. They smashed it to pieces, and spent the night driving around town, throwing the broken bits out of the window.

As months passed, Jennifer became increasingly suspicious of her husband.

She confronted Michael on New Year's Eve 2008 - he said the girl had grabbed his crotch once in their kitchen, and it 'partially aroused' him. It made Jennifer vomit.

However she stood by her man.

But their lives turn another horrible turn.

Hurting: Jennifer Lander has filed divorce from her husband but says he has a piece of her soul

Broke, the couple started stealing and selling appliances to make money after Michael quit teaching.

The thefts continued until 2010 when they were caught by Hernando deputies. Michael, now 40, took a seven-year plea to protect his wife. She got probation.

That's when Autumn revealed her stepfather's disturbing history. The girl went to police. 

Autumn, who said her 'heart hurts', claims Michael has sent her more than a hundred letters from prison.

One said: 'Autumn, sometimes we think we know more than we do. Sometimes we voice what we think we know, but don't. Sometimes we're toughest on those we love most,' he wrote.

'Sometimes we regret what we might say or what actions we take. Sometimes we are lucky. Always we miss those that we love when we are not in their company. Always do we try to protect our children from dangers seen or ever imagined.'

Jennifer has filed for divorce but has not yet had him served.

Michael's trial begins on October 1. He is charged with four sex crimes and could spend life behind bars.
