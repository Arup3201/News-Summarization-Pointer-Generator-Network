A City boss at a firm accused of racial harassment discrimination told his staff that badminton is a sport for 'gays', and told colleagues who played it to 'get a dress', a tribunal reportedly heard.

Neil Campbell, head of alternative investments at brokerage firm Tullett Prebon, is alleged to have described the racquet game as one for the 'gay and dainty' to his staff.

His former employee Kishore Kansal, 33, who is suing the firm for £1.5million in damages, complained about the comments in a grievance procedure he filed against Mr Campbell, before walking out of his job as a broker, and being fired for gross misconduct in his absence.

City worker: Private equity risk solutions manager Mr Kansal, who was on a £130,000-a-year-salary, has taken Tullett Prebon to an employment tribunal, citing racial harassment and discrimination

Private equity risk solutions manager Mr Kansal, who was on a £130,000-a-year-salary after joining the firm in May 2012, has taken Tullett Prebon to an employment tribunal, citing racial harassment, discrimination, unpaid bonuses, a public interest disclosure, and not being allowed to take, or be paid for, annual statutory leave. The claims are denied by Tullett Prebon, and six of Mr Kansal's ex-colleagues. 

According to The Independent tribunal heard that Mr Campbell had been interviewed over the comments, which he said he 'may have made', and it was recommended he be sent on a diversity training course.

The hearing was also told that sexist and racist jokes were also circulated among staff in the office via email, and that Asian employees were often described as terrorists.

Mr Kansal said he also heard his Asian colleagues being called 'terrorist,' 'brown boy' and 'dog' by Mr Campbell. 

Paul Dunkley, managing director of the firm's volatility group, had investigated Mr Kansal's complaint against Mr Campbell and, the court heard, was told during this probe that the alternative investments team was 'capable' of racist, homophobic and sexist comments, but that the matter was dropped.

Paul Gilroy QC, representing Mr Kansal, said one staff member, Kipp Elkington had told Mr Dunkley during the investigation that the culture of the desk stemmed from Mr Campbell.

Office: Mr Kansal worked as a private equity risk solutions manager at the company's offices at 155 Bishopsgate in the City of London

He asked if this had raised 'alarm bells', to which Mr Dunkley replied: 'It did… that all of the desk was acting inappropriately. Neil should have stopped it.'

During the investigation, Mr Campbell had told Mr Dunkley that Mr Kansal did not mix socially with his colleagues and was not a 'team player'. 

Mr Kansal, whose parents came from the Punjab more than half a century ago, told the hearing he had 'experienced a major culture shock' from the very first day of his job, and claimed he saw his colleague Ghatan Vahidy being mocked by Mr Campbell who imitated a Pakistani accent, accusing him of being a terrorist and commented that the British were fighting 'ragheads' in Afghanistan.

The tribunal heard Mr Campbell even twerked as he called another colleague, Maulik Patel, a 'brown boy' while a picture of terrorist Irfan Naseer was stuck on a wall behind his desk after some colleagues thought it 'bore a resemblance' to him.

Mr Kansal accused Mr Campbell of saying 'almost all private equity investors were deluding themselves. He referred to them as retards, idiots and imbeciles.'

Claims: Mr Kansal said he also heard his Asian colleagues being called 'terrorist,' 'brown boy' and 'dog' by his boss Mr Campbell

Despite trying to avoid attracting attention in the office, Mr Kansal claimed he was victimised when he refused to join in. He also said he was prevented from working from home and had his work internet restricted.

However, when he put in the grievance against Mr Campbell, his boss and others on the alternative investment team turned against him during a Christmas works lunch and he was forced to take sick leave and then unfairly sacked.

In his witness statement at the Central London Employment Tribunal Mr Kansal, 33, said he had worked private equity since graduating in law from UCL in 2002.

Describing Campbell's racist mocking of Mr Vahidy he said: 'Neil Campbell stood up with a large grin on his face and said "you can't say that. You can't say anything.

'"You speak like this" and then proceeded to do an impression of a Pakistani accent, saying "bud-li, bud-li, bud-li."

'He slightly angled his head each time he said "bud-li" in a way I recognised to be uniquely South Asian."

As the weeks passed he added: 'He made these comments with such frequency that I came to expect them. It was regular, almost like clockwork.

'He would have his favourite terms such as terrorist and brown boys that he would roll out on an almost daily basis and he would rarely miss an opportunity to make a new comment if the opportunity presented itself.

'I was also surprised by how the others in the office took this behaviour. There was no apparent protest.

'They would all seem to show loyalty often laughing along and even contributing to the jokes.'

Of the 800 people working on his floor at 155 Bishopgate, Mr Kansal said 'almost 99.9 per cent were white, middle-aged males.'

There were no black people, only a handful of Asians and 'hardly any women around, and I noticed that the women that were there seemed to be young and very attractive," he told the tribunal

He said he feared leaving the firm because of the potential damage to his reputation adding: "Private equity is a highly specialised and niche sector.

'If I suddenly left people would assume that I had failed to generate any business and my reputation would be damaged substantially.'

Despite being promised bonuses of 75 to 85 per cent of net revenues instead of being paid £262,387 between June and December 2013 he says he only got £28,643, while his white colleagues received £198,000 and £192,000.

Mr Kansal left the company on February 4 of this year and tried to claim he was constructively dismissed.

Probe: The Central London Employment Tribunal (pictured) was told that at the same time Mr Kansal's grievance was being investigated, he was himself the subject of a disciplinary procedure against him was launched the same day because the firm said he had emailed private company data to his own email address

However, a disciplinary procedure against him was launched the same day because the firm said he had emailed private company data to his own email address.

Refusing his appeal it accused him of 'wrongdoing and damaging the team' and then dismissed him on March 27 this year.

His whistleblowing claims were also dismissed as 'frivolous and vexatious.'

A spokesman for the company said: 'Tullett Prebon denies all allegations and defends these claims vigorously.'

During the hearing Jane Russell, representing the company, said Mr Kishal himself had helped create the hostile environment he claimed he was a victim of.

Mr Kansal admitted emailing colleagues a clip of the North Korean dictator Kim Jon Il from the South Park film Team America after a conference call with a south east asian client in the US who had a 'very funny accent.'

She said: 'How can you be the victim of the hostile environment that you created? To the extent you are seeking compensation for this environment - that means you are being rewarded, at least in part, for your own wrongdoing isn't it?'

The hearing continues.
