A couple has been arrested for allegedly crashing a wedding at a Mormon church and stealing $550 from the gift table after seeing the wedding announcement in a local newspaper.

Richard Duran and Tarnya Muir, both 46, went to the church in Price, Utah on Friday after getting a ride from Duran's cousin.

They allegedly told him they wanted to pass on their congratulations to the bride and groom - but in fact, police believe they went with the intention to steal from the newlyweds.

'We believe they looked in the paper, there was a [wedding] announcement, they saw that and they decided, "Let's go to that reception",' Price Police Capt. Bill Barnes told the Deseret News.

Busted: Tarnya Muir, left, and her boyfriend Richard Duran, right, have been arrested for allegedly stealing cash gifts from a wedding. They told police they knew the bride and groom - but couldn't remember their names

'Plot': Duran and Muir, pictured, got a ride with his cousin and claimed they wanted to wish the couple well

Muir allegedly went to the table where guests had placed gifts and cards containing money for the couple, Ryan and Keosha Rasmussen.

Once there, the 83-year-old grandmother of the groom spotted Muir filling her bag with cards, according to witnesses at the event.

When another relative asked her if she had taken the cards, Muir denied it, they added.

'My daughter followed her and could see the envelopes in the purse, so she grabbed the purse and knocked the lady down,' the groom's mother, Kaye Rasmussen, said. 'The lady kicked her.'

Victims: Ryan and Keosha Rasmussen were unable to enjoy usual wedding celebrations, such as cutting the cake, because their guests were making witness statements to police following the theft

Scene: After leaving the church in Price, Utah, they drove away but were chased by wedding guests

Duran then allegedly pulled the purse from Rasmussen's daughter and the thieves fled to the cousin's car outside the church.

Relatives of the newlyweds also jumped into a car and chased the pair as other family members called 911. Officers caught up with the chase as it came to a stop on the edge of Price.

Police said they recovered 20 cards containing around $550.

Muir told police she was friends with the bride - but allegedly could not remember her name.

Duran and Muir were booked into the Carbon County Jail for investigation of theft. The cousin who drove the couple to the church was not arrested.

Reminiscent: Actors Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are pictured in the 2005 movie Wedding Crashers - but police say Muir and Duran's plans to steal from the party were much more malicious

'We've had these incidents before but nothing this blatant from career criminals targeting a reception,' Barnes told the Deseret News.

The newlyweds are now enjoying a honeymoon cruise but Kaye Rasmussen said the incident upset their wedding.

'We missed some of the little things, like cutting the cake and the dance, because everyone was filling out police reports,' she said. 'But they'll have something to tell their kids. It's kind of a unique memory.'
