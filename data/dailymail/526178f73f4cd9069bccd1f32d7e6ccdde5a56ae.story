An extensive landfill search for a missing five-year-old which cost more than $750,000 ended this week with no trace of the girl's body.

Jhessye Shockley, from Glendale, Arizona, has been missing since October last year and her mother Jerice Hunter remains the chief suspect.

Despite the four-and-a-half month search turning up nothing, Jhessye's family and police say they have not given up hope of finding her remains or of pursuing the case against her mother, who is currently behind bars.

Missing: Jhessye Shockley has been missing since October 11 and police now believe she was dead before even being reported missing

The search was expected to last up to six weeks but instead continued for almost five months

According toÂ The Republic, some of the girl's family gathered on Monday at the landfill south of the Valley to say goodbye.

They hugged and thanked officers who spent weeks sifting through roughly 9,500 tons of compressed trash.

One searcher even brought flowers as police strongly believe that the landfill is Jhessye's final resting place.

Lisa Vance, a family member who helped raise the girl, told The Republic: 'We're
not going to be able to go to a cemetery to visit Jhessye or leave 
flowers. Now we're just waiting for justice for Jhessye.'

Assistant Police Chief Rick St John apologized to the family for not being able to find Jhessye's body.

He said: 'We ask for your forgiveness. We wanted to find Jhessye and bring her home. We were unable to do that.

'Our resolve, our commitment, our conviction is to (prove she was murdered).'

According to a court document, Jhessye's 13-year-old sister told police her mother kept the girl in a closet, and that Jhessye had black eyes, cuts and bruises before she was reported 
missing.

The teen recounted an incident just weeks earlier when Hunter returned home to find Jhessye wearing a 
long T-shirt while watching TV with a boy.

She told the girl 
that she was a 'ho' before taking her into a bedroom, according to the 
document.

Hopeful: Police say they know the exact date the body was dumped and where and were hopeful they would be able to find the remains

The teen said she could hear her sister screaming and crying in the room, the document said.

She also told police that Hunter kept
Jhessye in a bedroom closet and deprived her of food and water, according to the document.

'(She) reported that Jhessye's hair 
had been pulled out and described Jhessye as not looking alive and that 
she looked like a zombie,' it said.

'(She) said that the 
closet where Jhessye had been looked like a grave and smelled like dead 
people.'

The teen said Hunter placed incense in a container to conceal the odor.

She also said that a few days before 
Jhessye disappeared, her mother spent the entire day cleaning the 
apartment and cleaning her shoes from the closet with soap and bleach.

Police said they found a receipt that showed Hunter bought food and a 
bottle of bleach two days before she reported her daughter missing.

In court: Jhessye's mother Jerice Hunter is the primary focus of the investigation. She appeared in court on child abuse charges and is held on a $100,000 bail

Hunter was arrested on a felony count
of child abuse, more than five weeks after she reported Jhessye's disappearance.

Hunter was held on a $100,000 bond and has appeared in court, where she has protested her innocence.

Hunter claims she went out for an errand and left the girl in the 
care of three older siblings at their apartment.

AZCentral.com reported the sister said the last time she saw Jhessye 
was September 12. The report says school records indicate Jhessye's last 
day at school was September 22.

Police have said they no longer expect to find the five-year-old alive.

A spokesman told the Arizona Republic that authorities are determined to search as long as it takes to find the body.

'That means ripping every single bag, going through everything,' said the spokesman.

Police told ABC15.com that 40 people will work eight hours a day on the operation.

Glendale Police Chief Steve Conrad added: 'We would love nothing more than to find
Jhessye and hold the person who is responsible for her death 
accountable. I feel we owe 
that to her, her family and the community.'

Police were unable to recover bodies during two searches of the same landfill in the late 90s.

Lisa Vance, who helped raise the girl while her mother served time in prison for child abuse, told The Republic: 'I'm very confident that when they go out there, however many days it takes, they are going to find Jhessye. They just have to.'

But Hunter's attorney, Scott Maasen, expressed surprise that authorities had not launched the search sooner.

Worrying: Jhessye vanished from her hometown of Glendale without a trace

'They said almost two months ago they 
were possibly going to search the landfill,' he said. 'It begs the 
question, why has there been a delay for so long?'

Police claim they spent recent months figuring out the specific day they believe the body was dumped so a search would be more successful.

Hunter, whom police have named as a 'number one' interest in the case, has also been critical of the investigation into finding her daughter:

She said in December: 'We feel that law enforcement is not 
active in finding Jhessye and that they're more active in persecuting me
instead of finding out where she is.

State Child Protective Services 
removed Hunter's other children, including a newborn, from her apartment in November.
