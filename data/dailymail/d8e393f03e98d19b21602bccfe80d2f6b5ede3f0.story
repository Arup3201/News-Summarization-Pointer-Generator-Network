Blue suits are undergoing a surge in popularity - and are outselling their more muted counterparts by four to one

For years they’ve been pushed to the back of the wardrobe.

But now blue suits are undergoing a surge in popularity – and are outselling their more muted counterparts by four to one.

Figures for John Lewis show that for the first time in its 150-year history, the store is selling one blue suit every four minutes – four times the number sold in black.

Meanwhile Marks and Spencer is selling twice as many blue suits as black and have doubled their range to cope with the demand.

A spokesman for John Lewis said the colour’s versatility was crucial, adding that different shades meant shoppers could be more adventurous.

As a result, they too have shipped in more blue designs – doubling its range of blue suits over the same period.

It now sells two blue suits for every black one. Tom Saunders, a buyer for men’ s formal wear at John Lewis, said the versatility of a blue suit was key.

He said that while with black it was only really possible to change the weave, there were different shades of blue and so a shopper could be more adventurous.

Sales of the retailer’s bolder ‘statement’ blue suits were up 51 per cent on last year, compared with a 20 per cent rise for classic navy.

Charles McKenna, buying director at menswear chain Slaters, told the Independent on Sunday: ‘Last year, various shades of grey became very popular.

‘This year, the cloth mills introduced blue in various shades, royal blue being extremely popular.

‘They key point is these suits have to be in a modern shape, slimmer fit, shorter jacket, narrower trousers and teamed with tan shoes.’

Slaters has also expanded its blue suit range by a quarter for this coming autumn/winter season and by a third for the spring/summer season of 2015.

At Moss Bross, the formal menswear specialist, there has also been a 36 per cent year-on-year rise in the sales of blue suits.

By comparison, there has been a 28 per cent drop in black suit sales.

Actor Daniel Craig wore a blue suit in Casino Royale and then again appeared in a midnight-blue tux in the 2012 film Skyfall, helping to kick-start the trend.

John Lewis are set to launch a new navy dinner suit for the first time this autumn at 15 of their branches across the UK.
