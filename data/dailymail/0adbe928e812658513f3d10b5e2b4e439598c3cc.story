The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are 
preparing to move into their new country bolthole with baby son Prince 
George in a matter of months, MailOnline can reveal.

It is understood that the Queen has 
asked the current tenant of Anmer Hall in Norfolk to vacate the property
 as soon as possible, four years before his lease is up.

The 10-bedroom Georgian property is 
situated on the monarch’s private estate at Sandringham and has been 
lived in by company director James Everett and his family for 13 years. 
He also runs his bespoke timber company, Norfolk Oak, from its stables.

However the magnificent mansion has now been earmarked by William and Kate as second home for their family.

The couple are already renovating 
another 20-room home in Kensington Palace to serve as their primary 
London residence, which has so far cost taxpayers £1.1 million in 
building costs.

Last night it was confirmed to the
 Mail that the family business had already started moving out of Anmer 
Hall ahead of the lease, which had not been due to end until March 
2017. 

The business is in the process of relocating to new premises at nearby RAF West Raynham.

But reports that he is receiving compensation from his landlord, the Queen, to leave were denied.

The news coincides not just with the 
birth of William and Kate’s first baby on Monday, but also the end of 
William’s current job as a Search and Rescue pilot based at RAF Valley 
in Anglesey.

One possibility is that he could 
transfer to fly with 22 Squadron B Flight at nearby RAF Wattisham in 
Suffolk, where his brother Prince Harry is also based with the Army Air 
Corps, using the new Norfolk home as a base.

But it is more likely he will transfer back to London for a new office-based role with the Household Cavalry.

Either way, dozens of specially 
trained armed police officers are now being recruited to guard Anmer 
Hall on a rolling 24 hour, seven day a week basis, in line with other 
royal properties.

Norfolk Police confirmed to the Mail 
this week that they are looking to beef up the security capability 
around the Queen’s Sandringham Estate, on which the house is situated.

It is understood that around forty to 
fifty police officers will be involved in the operation, with extra 
personnel being sought from both within existing Norfolk police ranks 
and outside. It costs at least £100,000 to train and arm each firearms 
officer and the cost will be met by taxpayers.

A spokesman for Norfolk police 
confirmed: ‘Recruitment for additional Authorised Firearms Officers 
(AFOs) in Norfolk remains open at this time, to both internal and 
external candidates, as we seek to address a current shortfall in 
numbers.

‘Our AFOs are required both for normal
 policing duties and to support our on-going commitment to the Royal 
Estate at Sandringham in the west of the county.’

An insider added: ‘The force needs to train more armed cops as the couple are going to live there sooner rather than later.’

New chapter: The news coincides not just with the birth of William and Kate's first baby, but also the end of William's current job as a Search and Rescue pilot based at RAF Valley in Anglesey

A raft of new security measures have 
also been approved by the local council, including the planting of 
dozens of trees to shield the stunning property from public view.

According to a planning application 
lodged with King’s Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council, an existing 
wood store will be converted into extra accommodation – mostly likely 
for police officers guarding the property – while a garage block will be
 transformed into an equipment room.

Other plans involve moving the main 
gates to the property further down the access lane so members of the 
public will not be able to get so close to the house.

Royal aides have also been given 
planning permission to begin extensive improvements including a new 
garden room and a pergola made from stone columns with oak beams for 
plants to trail through, providing both shade and privacy on the patio 
area.

These will be designed by architect 
Charles Morris, who was behind a controversial extension for Prince 
Charles at his own country home.

Council officers have approved the 
plans under delegated powers, which means they did not have to go 
through the usual council planning process.

Anmer Hall is one of 150 situated on 
the monarch’s 20,000-acre Sandringham Estate in Norfolk and is only two 
miles east of Sandringham House, one of her favourite private 
residences.

The hall, which largely dates back to 
1802, was used as an illicit bolt-hole by Prince Charles and the then 
Camilla Parker-Bowles during their long-running affair when it was 
rented by the prince’s friend Hugh van Cutsem.

Prince William, who is close to the 
van Cutsems’ children, is also said to have enjoyed many happy visits to
 the hall as a child.

It also has something of a royal 
pedigree having been leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their 
country house from 1972 until 1990.

The house, which has a swimming pool 
and tennis court, will provide a place where the young family will be 
able to entertain and host guests.

It is also close to Holkham beach where Prince George will be able to play as his father and grandfather both did.

The Sandringham Estate has been owned by the Queen since her accession in 1952 and by the Royal Family since 1862.

Although much of the land is open to 
the public, the paparazzi are no longer allowed to photograph the Royal 
family relaxing there, making it even more attractive to the Duke and 
Duchess.

A spokesman last night declined to 
comment about royal plans for Anmer Hall but stressed that Kensington 
Palace would be the Cambridge’s ‘primary and long-term residence, where 
they plan to spend the next few decades’.
