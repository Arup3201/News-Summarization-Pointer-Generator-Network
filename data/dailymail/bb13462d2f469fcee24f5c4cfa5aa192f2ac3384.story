Three train employees were killed yesterday when a train derailed and fell 40 feet into a ravine in New Mexico - and authorities still don't know what caused the accident.

Police on Sunday identified the three as 38-year-old Donald White, 60-year-old Steven Corse and 50-year-old Ann Thompson. White lived in Silver City, New Mexico, and Corse and Thompson lived in the northern Arizona community of Paulden.

No other people were on the train and no one else was hurt.

State Police spokesman Emmanuel Gutierrez said it's unknown what caused Saturday afternoon's derailment on Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold property near the community of Bayard, about 75 miles northwest of Las Cruces.

It's unclear what preceded the derailment.

The eight rail cars being pulled by the locomotive weren't forced into the ravine.

Instead, they remained either on or near the tracks.

At least half of the eight train cars had tilted on their sides, but none of the iron ore being carried by the train had spilled out.

However, the derailment did cause a diesel fuel leak which the Silver City Fire Department work to contain late Saturday.

Photos taken by investigators show the locomotive on its side in the ravine.

The train was operated by Southwest Railroad Inc. and was on its way to Santa Rita.

Brian Beaty, manager of operators for safety and compliance for the rail company, says the company expects a cause for the derailment to be issued at some point Sunday.Â
