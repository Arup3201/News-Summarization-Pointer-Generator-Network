Christmas may be a time to give, but at Pindara Hospital it's also a time to dance.

Specialist doctors from Pindara Private hospital in southeast Queensland have made a cringeworthy dance video set to Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You.

The choreographed clip comes complete with fighting elves, a boozy Santa Clause and some rather randy patients.

It comes after the hospital released a video last year dancing to Maroon 5's Moves Like Jagger, which garnered over 117,000 views on YouTube. 

The videos are released annually to present at Christmas party celebrations, in a bid to bolster the festive spirits. 

 Among the dancers are an orthopedic surgeon, an emergency department doctor, an anaesthetist, an ear nose and throat specialist, reports Gold Coast Bulletin.

The Hospitals Marketing manager Robbie Falconer said 'You can see from the bloopers, they just had a really great time.  They were good sports, they put on the costumes.'

'You feel good when you see it and feel the spirit of Christmas.'
