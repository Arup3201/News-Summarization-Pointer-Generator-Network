This festive collection ofimages proves it's not just humans who enjoy tucking in to one too many mince pies, wearing garish festive attire and playing around in the snow.

Because as the storms continue to rage outside, these hardy creatures have well and truly embraced the winter weather and are lapping-up all the best elements of Christmas.

One squirrel who's clearly not watching his weight greedily gobbles down a mince pie, while another, more health conscious creature, daintily reaches out for some berries.

Meanwhile, one very over-excited dog is clearly loving his Father Christmas hat - bounding down the hallways of the Battersea Dogs Home with an excited look on its face, while another squirrel looks longingly at a royal blue festive jumper.

Elsewhere, a selection of birds do some last minute food shopping - picking up some festive essentials and taking them back to their nests.

And then there's the Kali polar bear, who looks blissfully happy playing around in the snow and Hazel, the search dog in Afghanistan who's thrilled at her gifts.

Crashing out: All that hard-going walking in the snow was obviously too much for the fluffy youngster, who takes a little nap
