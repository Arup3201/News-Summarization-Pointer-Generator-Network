Rio Ferdinand faces an uncertain 
future after Sir Alex Ferguson promised to take action against the 
Manchester United defender for refusing to wear a Kick It Out 
T-shirt.

The 
33-year-old is known to be unhappy at a perceived lack of activity from 
the anti-racism organisation, but his manager had promised that all his 
players would wear the T-shirts before Saturday’s 4-2 win over Stoke City at
 Old Trafford.

‘It’s
 embarrassing for me,’ said irate Ferguson. ‘It had the support of the 
PFA, and every player in the country should have adhered to that from 
the PFA’s request. We’re all wearing the badges and he goes and he lets us down.’

The irate manager added: ‘We’ll deal with it, don’t worry.'

In the red: Rio Ferdinand did not wear the Kick It Out t-shirt before Manchester United played Stoke

Ferdinand's boycott came in the wake of widespread player protests on Friday as many reacted to 
the FA’s apparently lenient punishment of John Terry for his 
abuse of his brother, Anton Ferdinand, last year.

The defender was the 
sole player in the Manchester United squad not to wear the T-shirt over 
his tracksuit top as he warmed up alongside Wayne Rooney before their 
home match with Stoke.

Ferdinand,
 who is out of contract at the end of this season, may now face 
disciplinary action.

He is not the first player to feel Ferguson’s wrath
 during his 26 years in charge at Old Trafford.

David
 Beckham famously caught a boot in the face from the angry Scot after 
United lost at home to Arsenal in the FA Cup and was sold to Real 
Madrid four months later.

Ruud van Nistelrooy was also shown the door after 
he displeased Ferguson following a training ground row with Cristiano 
Ronaldo.

And Roy 
Keane’s days at Old Trafford came to an end in 2005 after the club had 
to pull an interview with MUTV, in which he criticised United’s younger 
players following a 4-1 thrashing at Middlesbrough.

Ferdinand,
 now in his 10th year at United, appeared to have mended his 
relationship with Ferguson after the manager’s decision to hand the club
 captaincy to Nemanja Vidic in 2010.

The
 33-year-old is vitally important to Ferguson at the moment with Vidic 
out of the team with an injury until the New Year and central defenders Chris Smalling and 
Phil Jones slowly making their way back to fitness.

Such
 is his need for Ferdinand to remain fit that Ferguson urged the 
defender to retire from international football in his programme notes on
 Saturday to prolong his career at United.

The controversial defender is also not the only one to have shunned the Kick It Out campaign.

In an apparent act of solidarity, the entire Swansea and Wigan squads 
also did not wear the t-shirts.

But in direct contrast to Ferguson's views, Swansea manager Michael Laudrup said that wearing the T-shirt should
 be an individual choice for players. ‘The issue isn’t a football one, it’s social,’ said 
Laudrup. ‘You can’t tell players, “You have to do it”.

‘This is the opinion of the players 
[not wearing the shirts]. You have to ask them, not me. There are things
 you have to leave to each person.’

Manchester City’s England defender Joleon Lescott also refused to wear one. He has not worn
 a Kick It Out T-shirt since 2007 after Newcastle’s Emre Belozoglu 
escaped punishment at an FA inquiry for allegedly racially abusing 
Everton’s Joseph Yobo during a game in December 2006. 

Lescott, an Everton player at the 
time, provided written evidence but the charge against Turkey midfielder
 Emre was not proven. Lescott was joined in his protest by clubmate 
Micah Richards.

The decision of Stoke’s Trinidad 
striker Kenwyne Jones to join the protest was supported by his manager 
Tony Pulis, who said it was a tribute to Britain’s democracy that 
players had the right to choose whether they wore the T-shirt.

‘People in this country have the 
right to say Yes or No. In a lot of countries you haven’t the right. You
 can do what you want here. You have the chance to stand up and say you 
don’t want to do it.

‘This is a great country. It is multi-cultural. It is the best country in the world. They might have a gripe.

‘I’ve never — and no club I’ve 
managed — have ever worried about anything like that. Black, white, 
Catholic, Protestant, you treat people as human beings. There is good 
and bad in religion and colour. You have to be straight down the middle 
and treat everyone the same.’

The disquiet over Kick It Out is set 
to continue, with Everton players Victor Anichebe and Sylvain 
Distin insisting they will refuse to wear the T-shirts at QPR. Their 
stance may be backed by other team-mates.

Anichebe, a devout Christian, said: 
‘Personally, I don’t think I will wear it. In fact, I know I won’t. I 
don’t want to be some poster boy for kicking racism out of football 
because I don’t even want to talk about situations that have happened.

‘Are we really kicking racism out? 
That’s the thing. I still believe in the same thing. Kick racism out of 
everything, not just football. Kick it out of everything — society. We 
are all fighting the same thing, whether you wear a T-shirt or not.’

Kick It Out chairman Lord Herman 
Ouseley insisted it was ‘ridiculous’ for players not to wear T-shirts. 
‘It’s ridiculous to say that by not wearing a T-shirt or by not 
supporting Kick It Out you are actually going to change things,’ he 
said.
