Train companies and energy firms have been urged to be 'socially responsible' towards flood-hit customers hit by huge bills.

David Cameron backed the idea of first class carriages being scrapped to make more room on disrupted trains for stand class ticket holders and urged power firms to consider waiving some charges for people who have been flooded out of their homes.

The Prime Minister also insisted councils should not be charging residents in flood-hit areas for sandbags.

Strong winds and heavy rain across the UK have caused major disruption across large parts of the rail network, including these commuters at Manchester Piccadilly

High
 winds, heavy rain, fallen trees and flood waters have hit train services 
across large parts of the country, with many trains cancelled or 
delayed.

In many areas speed restrictions have been imposed, with just a fraction of the normal number of services running.

It means those trains which are running are packed with commuters and people struggling to get to work or visit friends and family.

Those in standard class are forced to stand in increasingly cramped conditions, while first class carriages remain out of bounds.

Now the Prime Minister has agreed to discuss lifting restrictions on first class to make travelling on Britain’s railways less uncomfortable.

Mr Cameron was challenged during an interview on BBC Radio Berkshire, where he was told that just five trains an hour were running from Reading to Paddington, compared to the usual 25 services.

Prime Minister David Cameron

Asked if first class carriages should be opened up to all passengers, the PM said: ‘That’s a very good suggestion which I will take that up with them.

‘I’ll discuss that with First Great Western when we have the Cobra meeting this afternoon.

‘What we need to do is recognise these are going to be very difficult times because there are only limited services that can be run. First Great Western and Network Rail are doing everything that they can.’

He also urged utility companies to consider cutting bills for people in flood-affected areas if they were unable to use their services.

'They need to be socially responsible partners to their customers and they should be considering these things, particularly if people haven’t been able to use the services,' he said.

David Cameron said he would discuss scrapping first class rail restrictions at a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee

Town halls must not charge for sandbags, David Cameron said today.

The Prime Minister said councils could recoup the costs from central government.

Christchurch Borough Council in Dorset has been asking locals to pay £30 for a 'flood pack' of four standard sandbags and one to protect doorways.

A spokesman said: 'The situation is that if an emergency is called then we will provide sandbags free of charge.'

Up until the end of last week, Tewkesbury Borough Council was issuing free bags to local people - but asking them to pay for sand to go in them.

A spokeswoman said it had now decided to be 'flexible' about the policy.

But writing on Twitter, Mr Cameron said: 'I've told local councils they should not charge for sandbags in flood-hit areas - central government will pick up the cost.'

However, Labour leader Ed Miliband called on the Prime Minister to live up to his pledge to ensure money is no object in dealing with the relief effort.

'We need the Government to turn warm words into real action - from the provision of sandbags to getting our transport infrastructure up and running, to having the necessary investment we need in flood defence,' Mr Miliband said.

'The Prime Minister made big promises this week, now he’s got to deliver on them.

'The problem has been that the Government has been too slow and inconsistent in its response.'

Train services hit by the atrocious weather include those run by First Great Western, First TransPennine Express, London Midland, Northern Rail, Virgin Trains, East Coast and Northern Rail.

The winds were so severe last night Virgin trains urged all customers to 'abandon travel'. Travellers already on trains were let off at the nearest station.

Many travellers who were already on board trains described being stuck for several hours.

Rachel Sigsworth wrote on Twitter: 'Stuck on a wobbling train in the middle of a storm! Freezing! starving! Wet foot! Send help!'

Tony Hawks posted a message to say 'I am stuck on a train in the West Country. I have been on it for five hours'.

And Erin Mary Elizabeth wrote: 'Seriously was stuck between Basingstoke and Fleet for ages on the train in the dark. Not fun.'

First Great Western is advising passengers not to travel, but has lifted ticket restrictions across the network until tomorrow.

A spokesman said: 'We recently removed first class compartments on our local commuter trains to create more space for standard class customers.

'In addition our train managers are already empowered to declassify first class carriages on our high speed trains as the need arises.

'We are re-enforcing this message between Paddington and Reading to make sure this happens when it is sensible to do so.'

The service from London Paddington to Cardiff has been cancelled, but all other trains between London Paddington and Swansea are still running and will call at Cardiff Central.

A half-hourly service will run between London Paddington and Bristol, while service will run every hour from London Paddington and Exeter St Davids.

Trains between Worcester and London Paddington will only run between Worcester and Oxford and an hourly shuttle service will run between Oxford and Didcot Parkway

On the London to Reading route, stopping services will run every 30 minutes, while a shuttle service will run between London Paddington and Slough every hour.

In the North West services run by First TransPennine Express, London Midland, Northern Rail and Virgin Trains are all affected, according to National Rail Enquiries.

No trains will run between Liverpool Lime Street and Crewe until approximately 10am because of overhead wire damage near Runcorn, and replacement buses will be running. Trains between Preston and Blackpool North may be delayed by up to 20 minutes because of a problem at a level crossing.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said the government had to turn warm words into action

East Coast and Northern Rail trains between Leeds and Wakefield Westgate/Doncaster will not run until at least 8am because of an overhead wire problem near Fitzwilliam, while East Coast, CrossCountry and First TransPennine Express services between Darlington and York may be delayed because of overhead wire problems between these stations.

Trains between Edinburgh and Newcastle have an 80mph speed restriction, meaning delays of up to 15 minutes.

In Wales storm-force winds are expected to cause further delays today. Trees on the line between Clarbeston Road and Fishguard Harbour mean no trains will be running between these stations, while trains are suspended between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog because of an obstructed line.

Buses will replace trains between Aberystwyth and Machynlleth until noon because power cables have been blown on to the tracks between Aberystwyth and Dovey Junction

No trains are running between Wolverhampton and Stafford because of an overhead wire problem between the stations, which is not expected to be fixed until 8.30am.
