With a fashionista for a wife, David Cameron has no excuse for dodgy holiday gear. 

But the Prime Minister has managed to fail again with his non-work wardrobe - showcasing a pair of dusty old brown sandals on his annual trip to Cornwall. 

The 47-year-old must've been reading up on his holiday trends, because pool sliders are one of the hottest trends of 2014, but Mr Cameron's effort seemed like they were more likely to have come from 1814.

David Cameron enjoys a coffee at the Surfside Cafe in Polzeath, with his wife Samantha seemingly unaware of the fashion disaster lurking underneath their table

His wife Samantha seemed oblivious of the horrors lurking under their bistro table as they enjoyed a cappuccino at the Surfside Cafe in Polzeath this afternoon. 

Indeed, the PM should have asked the ambassador for the British Fashion Council for some style advice before he packed his suitcase for the seaside trip. 

Samantha, who won the British Glamour Magazine Award for Best Accessory Designer in 2009, rounded off her own outfit with a simple, yet stylish pair of flip flops. 

It isn't the first time the PM has attempted the trend either - he first showcased the unfortunate footwear on a holiday in Ibiza last year. 

He should have learnt by now: David Cameron first wore his sliders on a trip to Ibiza with the family in 2013 

MailOnline Fashion Expert Toni Jones said: 'When you live in a suit dressing down can be tricky and we know that the art of 'smart casual' doesn't come easily to David Cameron, but there's no excuse for shoes like this.

'His wife Samantha is revered for her style, but it's obvious from these pictures that she has given up trying to guide her spouse's sartorial decisions.

'This style of open-toed shoe - known as the slide - is actually the height of beach chic for 2014 when worn with a nod to sports luxe.

'But these battered old slip-ons scream 'comfort' not cool. 

'Mr Cameron obviously has bigger things to worry about than his footwear collection, but if he is interested in stepping his summer style up a level for his next break then I would suggest a pair of simple espadrilles, or if he's determined to feel the sun on his toes then a new pair of Birkenstocks is a cooler way to beat the heat.' 

On a trip to Portugal last month, David Cameron, pictured here in an Algarve fish market with wife Samantha, was much more successful with his choice of shoes - these stylish beige loafers 

Mr Cameron has been far more successful in recent months with his choice of weekend wear. 

A pair of stylish beige loafers from Aldo hit the right note as part of his holiday suitcase on a family holiday to Portugal last month. 

And he doesn't usually have any trouble with his office attire, typically managing to look much smarter than most politicians  while busy with the day job. 

Mr Cameron, pictured here at the  Relationships Alliance Summit 2014, always manages to look extremely smart when on official business as the British Prime Minister 

But the Conservative party leader has made the headlines for his terrible taste in the past - in 2011, he racked up thousands of column inches when he wore a pair of smart black leather loafers without socks on a family trip to Tuscany.

Fashion critics across the country cringed at the PM's hot feet squeezed into the uncomfortable office shoes in sweltering Mediterranean temperatures . 

Last year he admitted that he struggled with his fashion choices.

He said: 'I know so little about fashion that the two things I have been on the fashion pages for are not wearing socks with black shoes while on holiday — sorry about that — and attending a banquet at the Guildhall, where in full white tie my shirt separated, and there was a rather embarrassing picture. 

'I am obviously not a great exemplar of fashion. 

'When I go shopping my wife doesn’t allow me to look around the store at all, I am put in a changing room and things are passed to me like you would pass food to a prisoner.'
