Extraordinary footage has surfaced of Simon Ata, a Melbourne based break-dancing instructor whose gravity defying manoeuvres have made him a YouTube sensation.

In his incredible newest clip, the staggeringly strong Melbournite manoeuvers himself in a vertical 180 degree rotation, casting the illusion he is walking in a circle.

In another segment he pulls off one of his trademark moves, an eye-popping vertical push-up done on one hand.

Mr Ata told Daily Mail Australia the video was filmed over four sessions within a fortnight, and edited by his friend Dave Chea.

‘We had a list of moves we wanted to include but the sequence was pretty spontaneous,' he said. 

The trained dancer strategically altered his routine leading up to the newest clip.

‘I’ve been focussing on strength training lately and cutting back on the breakdancing. This meant I could break a longstanding plateau,’ he said.

The video, titled 'Simonster Strength 2.0', has garnered over 50,000 views since being uploaded to YouTube this week.

The trained dancer said he mixes up his training every week to keep it from feeling repetitive

Mr Ata said he changes his training from week to week in order to evade feelings of monotony.

‘I believe fitness should never feel like a chore.’

Mr Ata believes that his mode of callisthenics -bodyweight strength training-is rapidly gaining traction in mainstream society.

‘I’ve noticed a huge difference even in the last few years, noticing more and more people training this way.’

When asked what advice he offered to those who wanted to pursue a similar path, Mr Ata said

‘There's no substitute for hard work.’
