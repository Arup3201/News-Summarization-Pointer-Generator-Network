We've all been there after a big night out, or a lazy Sunday morning.

Feeling a bit worse for wear and wanting the only thing can provide the cure - a great mound of fast-food delivered straight to the door.

So news that fast food giant Burger King is starting a delivery service should please UK Whopper fans

Double Whopper to your door: Burger King is currently trialling a home delivery service in eight UK locations

Straight to your door: The fast food giant is is testing the home delivery service regionally before a wider national roll out later in the year

The trial service is currently only available in Romford, Truro, Hornchurch, Skegness, Hull, Northampton, Hayes, and Gants Hill.

Deliveries are made within a two-mile radius of participating restaurants and a minimum value of £14 is required for orders.

Customers in the eight locations are able to place orders over the phone or via the delivery website everyday between the hours of 12 noon to 3pm and 6 to 10pm.

Matthew Bresnahan, Marketing Director of Burger King Northern Europe, Russia,and Africa said: 'Burger King is firmly committed to delivering great-tasting food at affordable prices to all of our customers.

'We are extremely excited about this Home Delivery service trial so customers can continue to enjoy the perfect combination of taste, at great value prices, now delivered straight to their homes.' 

The news was greeted with joy by fans of the chain.

User @Skatronixxx tweeted Burger King delivery? Yes!!

And there were some who had already taken advantage of the trial service. 

User @westonbrowne1 uploaded a picture of his meal, tweeting: 'God bless your delivery @BurgerKing' 

But there are some who have yet to be convinced. 

Laura Williams, who goes by the handle @amusedkerching on Twitter said: 'Burger King is offering delivery service in some areas. I don't trust it. Everyone knows it's impossible to drive without eating the fries.'

Laura Williams thinks the delivery drivers might succumb to temptation and eat the fries 

User Dr Frank Simon seems to disagree with the concept of a Burger King delivery service 

Another user – Dr Frank Simon or @silverstar22b - was harsher in his condemnation of the fast-food giants, saying: 'Burger King have started a delivery service. Because their customers are now too f*cking fat to go out for it.'

For decades burger restaurants have resisted introducing home-delivery services as the snacks don't travel well and tend to go soggy when warmed up in a microwave.

But a few years ago Burger King claimed to have solved the problem by developing what it called 'proprietary thermal packaging technology,' which ensures the food won't arrive cold and congealed.

This new trial is testing the home delivery service regionally before a wider national roll out later in the year.
