The parents of two children who were found stabbed to death last year at their home on Manhattan's Upper West Side say they survived by turning to each other.

Kevin and Marina Krim spoke on Wednesday evening at a New York fundraiser for their nonprofit, the Lulu and Leo Fund, named for their two children killed on October 25, 2012, allegedly by their nanny.

In a rare public speech, Kevin Krim said that the couple found a reason to go on by leaning on each other, and their friends and family.

'We had every reason to feel alienated from the world after this happened,' he said. 'And to really, truly survive and to live again, we had to have a reason to live.'

Kevin Krim spoke at the benefit on Wednesday night saying that he and his wife Marina survived the devastating murders of their two young children by turning to each other

Marina and Kevin Krim, whose son and daughter were stabbed to death last year, held a fundraiser on Wednesday for the charity set up in honor of their children

He said they miss their children every
 day, and they will forever. "We are just heartbroken," he said. "But 
they inspire us every day as well. Their lives give us a purpose."

Krim,
 a CNBC digital media executive, said the art and creativity were 
important to Lulu and Leo, and that's why they started the fund - aimed 
at giving money to arts programs.

The
 nonprofit late last month announced its first grant would go to Free 
Arts NYC, a nonprofit that provides under-served children and families 
with mentoring programs through the arts. The fund specifically supports
 the Free Arts "Parents and Children Together with Art" program, where 
families work to increase communication and teamwork.

On
 Wednesday, the couple was hosting a silent auction with items like four
 tickets to Saturday Night Live, and an on-set pass for Sesame Street. 
The event was hosted by Jim Cramer of CNBC's "Mad Money," and attended 
by Katie Couric.

The 
parents whose two young children were murdered in their New York 
apartment last year announced the birth of their son today. 

Marina and Kevin Krim shared the happy news on a Facebook page 
 set up in the memory of their two children, two-year-old Leo and 
six-year-old Lulu who were allegedly stabbed to death by a nanny in 
their Upper West Side apartment in 2012.

The message, posted on Friday to the Lulu & Leo page, reads: 'From Marina and Kevin Krim -

'We

pounds, 10 ounces, and 21.5 inches of him, arrived today. Marina, Felix

Loss: Two-year-old Leo and his big sister Lulu, six, were found in a pool of blood in the family's home

Victims: Only Nessie, whose picture has been pixelated, escaped harm as she was with her mother

The Krims' former nanny, Yoselyn Ortega, has been 
charged with murder over the deaths of  two-year-old Leo and 
six-year-old Lulu.

She has pleaded not guilty. Marina 
Krim discovered her children when she returned from picking up the 
couple's third child, Nessie, from a swim lesson.

The 
Krims shared some happy news last month letting supporters know that they had a baby boy.
