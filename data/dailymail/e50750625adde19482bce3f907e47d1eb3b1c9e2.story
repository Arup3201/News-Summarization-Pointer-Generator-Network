Of all the reasons to buy a Tesla - the luxurious, eco-friendly electric cars created by billionaire inventor Elon Musk - there's a new reason with which even the priciest luxury cars can't compete: There is nearly a zero-percent chance that it will get stolen.

In fact, only four Teslas have been stolen - ever.

In 2013, only three of the pricey cars were stolen - one each in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. Prior to those three thefts, only one other Tesla had been stolen since the company was founded in 2003. That leaves Tesla with a theft rate of roughly 0.15 per 1,000 cars produced. The median theft rate for all cars
 is roughly 3.58 thefts per 1,000 vehicles produced, according to the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Pricey: A Tesla has a base price of roughly $70,000 - but that hasn't made them a target for thieves

Impressive: Teslas have a theft rate of 0.15 per 1,000 vehicles produced, which is better than almost all other popular luxury vehicles

And the cars' impressive theft statistic can't be dismissed as a product of the fact that there aren't many Tesla's on the road - according to MarketWatch.com, 'the auto maker sold about 20,000 cars in the US last year, according to 
IBISWorld lead analyst Brandon Ruiz. Based on that estimate, its theft 
rate is pretty low at roughly 0.15 per 1,000 cars produced; the median 
theft rate for all cars is roughly 3.58 thefts per 1,000 vehicles 
produced, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration.'

Teslas are unlikely to be stolen for a number of reasons - for starters, they're incredibly difficult to steal. Additionally, given the market for stolen cars and stolen car parts, it doesn't make much sense to steal a Tesla.

It's electric: Tesla is one of the most innovative, eco-friendly electric cars on the road

According to Mark Takahashi, an editor at Edmunds.com, cars are typically stolen for parts. But there isn't much demand for stolen Tesla parts - most people who can afford the upwards of $70,000 price tag can afford to buy legitimately purchased parts for the car.

Teslas also have unique FOB keys that are nearly impossible to replicate. And even if a thief were able to hack into Tesla's system and bypass the key, it's unlikely that the company wouldn't be able to track the stolen vehicle.

Luxury cars typically have theft rates lower than those of economy cars. For example, MarketWatch.com cites the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's latest data showing that 'of the 15,179 Infiniti FX35’s produced in 2008, 52 were stolen (that’s a rate of 3.43 cars per 1,000 made) and of the 159 Lamborghini Murcielago autos made in 2006, one was stolen (that’s a rate of 6.29 per 1,000 automobiles).'

Budget cars have much higher theft rates, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

According to the NTSB, the vehicles with the highest rates of theft per 1,000 vehicles produced are the Chevrolet Aveo, Chevrolet HHR, 
Chevrolet Impala, Hyundai Accent, 
Mitsubishi Galant and Dodge Charger.

Since Tesla was founded in 2003 only four cars have been reported stolen

Experts say the low theft rate can be attributed for the low demand for Tesla parts, as most cars typically are stolen to be broken down and sold strictly for the parts
