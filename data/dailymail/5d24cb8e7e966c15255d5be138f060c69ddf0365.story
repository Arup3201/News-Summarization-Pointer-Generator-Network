Thousands of protesters still camped out in the middle of Hong Kong are set to vote on whether to end their demonstration a month after it began.

Hong Kong authorities have agreed to submit a report to Beijing detailing the activists' anger, and asking for reform in the city's upcoming elections.

The leaders of the three main protest groups, which are still occupying the city's finance district, have agreed to hold a vote on Sunday before giving their reply.

The news came as protesters scuffled with anti-Occupy demonstrators holding Chinese flags who came to the barricades to oppose the camp which is blocking the streets.

Protesters said today that they will take a vote on dismantling their camp in Hong Kong, as tensions flared at one barricade as a man arrived carrying a Chinese flag to demand that they leave

The demonstrators, who have been on the streets for nearly a month, will vote on Sunday on whether or not to end their protest in return for more talks on elections

The student protesters are angry that a panel of 1,200 officials in Beijing will be allowed to hand-pick candidates for the 2017 elections.

The students say the committee should either be scrapped or reformed to better represent the their city of 7.2 million people. 

While their camps have been greeted by widespread support in Hong Kong, tempers have flared between the activists and residents on several occasions.

Hong Kong officials have also offered to hold regular talks with protesters about democratic reforms if they end their demonstrations. 

The Hong Kong Federation of Students, one of the main organizers behind the protests, has already rejected the government offer but still agreed to the Sunday referendum.

A spokeswoman for Occupy Central with Peace and Love, another protest group behind the referendum, said the ballot's phrasing and more details would be released later.

Elsewhere today, American jazz musician Kenny G - who was pictured in front of the protest camp making a peace sign two days ago - has said he does not support the activists.

The sax player, who is wildly popular in China, sought to distance himself after posting the image on Twitter on Wednesday along with the message 'In Hong Kong at the sight [sic] of the demonstration'.

Today he claimed it was 'unfair' that people were linking him to the protesters, saying the picture - which has now been deleted - was taken on an 'innocent walk' around the city.

He wrote: 'I was not trying to defy government orders with my last post. I was in Hong Kong as a stop on my way to perform at Mission Hills.

'I don't really know anything about the situation and my impromptu visit to the site was just part of an innocent walk around Hong Kong.

'I only wanted to share my wish for peace for Hong Kong and for all of China as I feel close to and care about China very much.' 

Earlier this week, Tung Chee-hwa, the city's first chief executive after its 1997 transition from British to Chinese rule, said that the protesters' demands were not realistic and that they should accept a longer timeline for electoral reforms.

'Students, I hope you listen to what this old man is saying,' the 77-year-old said in a news conference. 'It's time to go home.'
