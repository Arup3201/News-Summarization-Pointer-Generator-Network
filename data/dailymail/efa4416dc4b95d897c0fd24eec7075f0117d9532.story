The tragic accident left pedestrians and passengers deeply shaken 

'Seeing that she wasn't going to turn back or make it across in time, he slammed his brakes on but it was too late and the woman disappeared under his wheels.

'It was absolutely horrific.

'My daughter was with me and I quickly covered her eyes so she couldn't see it.'

Window passenger Constantin Ponta, 29, said: 'At first I wasn't sure what was going on.

'I heard the driver start swearing and beeping his horn and then there was a juddering stop.

Eyewitnesses said that the tram driver desperately beeped his horn to warn the pensioner she was in danger

Shock: Police said that the driver of the tram was deeply upset by the incident

'There were loads of people outside pointing at something under the tram and when I looked out of the window I thought I was going to be sick.

'There was the body of a grey haired woman sticking out from underneath.

'She was clearly dead.'

A police spokesman said: 'The driver was deeply upset by this tragedy but his version of events are supported by eye-witnesses so there will most likely be no charges after prosecutors have read the report.'

The woman's body was taken to the local morgue.
