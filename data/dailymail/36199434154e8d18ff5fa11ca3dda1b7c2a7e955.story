Paramedics kept Louise Lewis (pictured) waiting for 45 minutes while she suffered a heart attack... even though she lives next to an ambulance station

A mother suffering a heart attack was kept waiting for 45 minutes by paramedics even though she lives just two doors away from an ambulance station.

Health chiefs were today investigating after Louise Lewis, 36, called 999 when she was struck down with stabbing chest pains.

An operator told the mother-of-two, from Llanelli, South Wales, that an ambulance was on its way but couldn’t say how long it would take.

Ms Lewis looked out of her window to see two ambulances parked up in the depot in the same street.

But she was too weak to walk the 100 yards to knock on the ambulance crews' doors for help.

Desperate, Ms Lewis phoned again after 45 minutes and was told to keep waiting.

She then asked a friend to drive her to hospital where doctors found she had suffered a massive heart attack.

Ms Lewis said: 'I feel like I’m lucky to be alive, I could have died waiting for an ambulance to arrive.

'It’s ridiculous - I was looking out of my window and I could see two ambulances parked up at the station in my street.

'I was in a lot of pain and the operator could not tell us where the ambulance was coming from or when it would arrive.

'I
felt really let down - if there had been a problem getting an ambulance
out to me then they should have told us during the first phone call and
not kept us waiting.'

Ms Lewis underwent surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, South Wales, to clear her blocked arteries.

She is now recovering at home.

A
Wales Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We are unable to comment on 
individual cases but the trust is investigating this incident 
internally.'
