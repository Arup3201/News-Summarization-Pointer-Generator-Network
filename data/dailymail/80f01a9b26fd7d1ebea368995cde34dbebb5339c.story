The charity behind the aid convoy from which ISIS hostage Alan Henning was kidnapped is being investigated over alleged links to militants, it has emerged.

Father-of-two Mr Henning was seized by jihadists in Syria while attempting to deliver aid and now faces death at the hands of ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John'.

It emerged today that a charity involved in the mercy mission he took part in is now being investigated over alleged links to those fighting in the region.

There is no suggestion Mr Henning, 47, knew of the alleged connections between the charity and fighters.

An investigation was launched into the charity behind Alan Henning's aid mission after this photo emerged apparently showing Adeel Ali, the son of one the organisation's trustees, alongside two armed fighters. Mr Adeel has insisted the photo is not of him

Mr Henning, from Eccles, Salford, was driving an ambulance for Rochdale Aid 4 Syria, which raised money on behalf of Al-Fatiha Global, a British-based organisation which provides humanitarian aid to those caught up in warzones.

He was kidnapped shortly after the convoy crossed the border from Turkey into Syria in late December last year. 

Earlier this year, the Charity Commission announced it had launched a probe into Al-Fatiha Global over allegations of 'inappropriate links' to militants.

A statement from the regulator said it is examining the charity's accounting and alleged 'links between the charity and individuals purportedly involved in supporting armed or other inappropriate activities in Syria'.

The commission said: 'The inquiry is investigating serious concerns about the governance and financial management of the charity.

'The Commission had been monitoring the charity since 2013, and the inquiry, which is the most serious level of the regulator's investigatory work, opened on 21 March 2014.'

The investigation was launched after a photo emerged apparently showing Adeel Ali, the son of one of the organisation's trustees, standing in between two gunmen.

Muslims have said they warned Mr Henning that young jihadis had 'tagged along' with some convoys

Mr Ali has insisted the photo was not of him and he has always remained in Turkey when taking part in the convoys.

Mohammed Shafiq, of the moderate Ramadhan Foundation, said he warned Mr Henning of the dangers of entering Syria just weeks before his abduction.

He also voiced fears that some young Britons wanting to become jihadis had ‘tagged along’ with aid convoys as a way of joining IS.

He said: ‘The vast majority of people I know of who've been on the convoys are ordinary law-abiding Muslims who want to help the Syrian people.

‘Ninety-five per cent leave the aid at the Syrian border and go home, but of those who go into Syria some may have tagged along in order to join up with Isis.'

Mr Henning was kidnapped half an hour after his convoy passed into Syria, raising fears ISIS was 'tipped off'

Members of the convoy did not see him until he appeared in the latest beheading video with ISIS's 'Jihadi John'

Trustees of Al-Fatiha Global have declined to comment on Mr Henning's kidnap, but has previously insisted the charity is a purely humanitarian organisation.

In a statement made after the charity commission's investigation was launched, it stated: 'This charity is open to review and study for the management of the funds it has received and processed.

'There have been enquiries by the Charity Commission which have met with full co-operation of the trustees.

'It is apparent that there are sources who wish the Charity Commission to investigate this charity.

'The trustees will continue to act in accordance with charity law and will continue to publish their accounts. This charity was set up for humanitarian purposes and has always acted and operated on that basis.'
