'Holy warrior': Basit Javed Sheikh, 29, of Cary, N.C., is charged in a federal criminal indictment with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization

A North Carolina man is facing federal charges that he tried to join an al-Qaida-linked militant group fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Basit Javed Sheikh, 29, of Cary, is charged in a federal criminal indictment with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

He was arrested November 2 before boarding the first of a series of flights that would take him to Lebanon and then on to Syria.

Sheikh told an FBI informant he was going to join the group called the al-Nusrah Front in Syria, an FBI agent said in a sworn affidavit released this week.

The Pakistan native was assigned two federal public defenders to represent him during a court hearing last week.

For five months this year, Sheikh, also known as Abdul Basit, posted messages and pro-militant propaganda videos on at least two Facebook accounts expressing support for jihadi forces fighting Assad’s forces in the bloody, 3-year-old Syrian civil war.

The ongoing conflict so far has killed more than 100,000 people, said the affidavit signed by FBI Special Agent Jason Maslow.

The 29-year-old’s social media pages featured photos of machine guns, pictures of wounded American soldiers, and even an image of the U.S. Capitol building being destroyed by a massive wave.

In August, Sheikh began an online relationship with an FBI undercover employee on a Facebook page promoting Islamic extremism, the affidavit said.

The 29-year-old man allegedly said that he had secured a job 'with a brigade in logistics, managing medical supplies.'

Sheikh told the informant in early September that he'd bought a one-way ticket to travel to Turkey in hopes of making contact with people who would get him to Syria.

Sheikh said he backed out because ‘he could not muster the strength to leave his parents,’ the affidavit said.

Sheikh said he had traveled to Turkey last year hoping to join the fight in Syria, but became dispirited by his experience with people who claimed to be part of the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army, and who, according to Sheikh, were motivated by financial gain.

But according to the documents, Sheikh's desire to join the holy war was unshakable, and he told the covert FBI agent that 'he would not feel good about himself and would continue to feel like a hypocrite until he went on jihad.'

He was determined to be a martyr for the cause, he allegedly told the informant.

In late September, the mole put Sheikh in touch with 'a trusted brother' from the militant group Jabhat al-Nusra, who later turned out to be an FBI undercover agent.

Jabhat al-Nusra is also known as the Nusra Front - a cell of al-Qaida in Iraq which was designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. Department of State in 2002.

The Carey man is a legal permanent U.S. resident hailing from Pakistan. Between 1992 and 2000, he lived in the island Republic of Seychelles in the Indian Ocean.

Sheikh was described in the affidavit as a post office worker, but the U.S. Postal Service said in a statement that the 29-year-old was not employed by the agency.

His arrest came November 2 when he arrived at Raleigh Durham International Airport to board a flight to Turkey and Lebanon via Canada.

Sheikh checked in a bag and walked through the security checkpoint, at which point he was surrounded by law enforcement officials and taken away from questioning.

Prior to his arrest, the FBI informant offered Sheikh a chance to back out, telling him that 'fighting is not for everyone,' but the 29-year-old man plowed ahead with the plot.

‘I want to help in any way I can,’ Sheikh wrote, according to the affidavit, adding: ‘I'm serious [brother]. ... I'm not scared. ... I'm [sic] have though it out. ... I'm ready.’

He is being held without bond at Wake County Jail. If convicted, Sheikh could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and fined $250,000.

Four years ago, eight Raleigh-area Muslims were arrested on charges they were behind a homegrown terror plot to attack the U.S. Marine Corps base at Quantico, Va., and perceived overseas enemies of Islam.

Seven either pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges or were convicted at trial. The last, Jude Kenan Mohammad, was among four Americans confirmed as being killed by drones in either Pakistan or Yeman since 2009, the Obama administration said in May.
