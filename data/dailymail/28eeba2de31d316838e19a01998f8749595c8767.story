It is the retirement village gone wild; with Gold Coast residents claiming abuse, harassment and bullying from a group of other retirees on the body corporate committee - not to mention a still that allegedly has senior citizens illegally selling bottles of alcohol for $10.

Now, victims at Aveo retirement village at Ashmore's Amity Gardens in the Gold Coast is fighting back at the perpetrators voicing their complaints about the body corporate clique. 

Great grandparents Jon Withers and his wife June, have begun protesting against the injustice, in order to stop the control of the corrupt body corporate and retiree members, Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

Aveo retirement village describes the community as an 'oasis'

After the 77 years-old resident discovered Aveo's official Facebook page was monitoring posts by only approving comments of their choice, Mr Withers decided to create a public Facebook page which allowed residents to openly voice their concerns without censorship.

He and his wife, June, 70, wrote a letter to residents: 

'In the seven years we have lived in the village, from the beginning we endured bullying... a solid clique of supporters have held the control of the body corporate and residents committee, even protecting an illegal still operating in the village with sales to general consumers.' 

*Single female residents receive warning letters after having 'male visitors' at night 

*Illegal alcohol operation, as clique members sell spirits for $10 to elderly residents

*A 79 year-old woman was rushed to hospital after a parking confrontation between her and a body corporate committee member caused the retiree to experience overwhelming stress

*An elderly Asian resident was denied a herb garden by body corporate, which resulted in her leaving the village 

The couple claim they witnessed another resident carrying a box of spirits from a unit, driving off in a golf cart to sell the bottles to older women in the village, which apparently is initiation into the clique.

Another resident at the 122-unit estate have affirmed an illegal moonshine distribution within the community, after noticing the still  walking home through the village.

'There was steam coming up through a storm water drain. I thought something was on fire. It was from the still,' an elderly female said.

But illegal alcohol sales to elderly residents is not the communities only concern, some single residents claim 'continual harassment and verbal abuse', with one claiming she received an unjust warning from body corporate after a 'male friend' visited her during the evenings. 

'The send you a contravention notice for the car noise at night,' Dani Tobin said. 

A former member of the body corporate was pushed over the edge to resign after witnessing 'personal attacks' on residents at Aveo. 

The Withers said although advertising for the Facebook page has been removed, residents have not stopped posting their views on Facebook.
