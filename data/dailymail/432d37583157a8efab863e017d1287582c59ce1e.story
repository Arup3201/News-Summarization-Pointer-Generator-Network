Succulent deep-fried turkey is a top Thanksgiving trend this year according to experts and a new video shows a rather James Bond-style way of going about it.

Trained pilots from IntelligentUAS - a Maryland-based company specializing in drones - tethered a plucked turkey to a octocopter and flew it through the sky to a makeshift cooking station.

The big bird was then skilfully lowered into a pan of boiling oil in a bid to crisp it from beak-to-tail.

Skilled operation: Deep-fried turkey is the top Thanksgiving trend this year according to experts and a new video shows a James Bond-style method of cooking it

Over and out: Unfortunately the footage cuts with no shots of the resulting meal

Unfortunately the footage cuts at the one minute 46 second-mark with no shots of the resulting meal.

A banner at the end of the video warns viewers 'don't try this at home.'

Indeed, authorities are warning amateur chefs about frying turkeys as the appetite for them sky-rockets.

The Midland County Fire Department in Texas told  News West 9 that the oil presents a fire hazard as it bubbles to temperatures of 350 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.

It can also cause serious burn injuries if it spits out of the pan.

'There's other appliances now that you can use indoors that have the same effect for frying except you don't have the amount of grease and things that you use for deep frying,' a spokesperson from the department recommended.
