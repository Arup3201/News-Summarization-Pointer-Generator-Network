Holidaymakers who like the idea of exploring the great outdoors but shudder at the thought of a freezing, insect-infested tent may be interested in hiring a palatial motorhome - as long as they have £8,000 a night to spare.

The glittering tour bus, once used by F1 stars Jenson Button and, before him Jacques Villeneuve, is now being offered as a unique 'seven star' hotel.

It was hand-built for Villeneuve by U.S. company Newell and probably boasts similar fuel efficiency to an F1 car thanks to a 500bhp 12 litre engine that allows it to hit 100mph.

Guests who splash the cash will be greeted with champagne and a complementary hamper on arrival, while a personal team of waiters will be on hand for 24 hours a day.

On the Button: Formula 1 ace Jenson's former motorhome has been transformed into a luxury getaway - costing up to £8,000 a night

Seven star: The motorhome comes with a team of staff, including a gourmet chef and waiters, who cater to guests' whims around the clock

British racing champion Button owned the bus for eight years from 2003 until 2011 - and toured in it around the world during his title-winning season in 2009

The epitome of the trend for 'glamping' 
(glam camping), the first million-dollar motorhome also boasts its very own limousine, helicopter and 
Michelin star chef to enjoy in the extravagant bus - which boasts a 42in 
plasma TV, fully fitted American-style kitchen, a walk-in wardrobe and a
 gold ensuite bathroom.

The 500 sq ft palace - dubbed the 'Icon' - sleeps up to four people and is believed to be the largest motorhome in the UK.

Icon Experiences owner Andrew Morris said: 'The Icon is a living piece of history. A unique motorhome, which was the first million dollar motorhome to be created.

'We do have preferential privileged locations both in the UK and throughout Europe but we're more than happy to drive the Icon to the location of your choice.

'With our 24-hour support team always discreetly on hand, we will ensure that all the normal rigmarole of hiring a motorhome is taken care of.'

Glitter: The motorhome is now being offered as a unique 'seven star' hotel for tourists with a fat wallet. It is not known if the nighties on the bed are included in the price

Travel: The owers of the 'Icon' are than happy to drive it to the guest's location of choice

Red hot: Those who want to spend some time outdoors can enjoy a luxury BBQ under the stars while a top chef takes the strain on the cooking

The ultimate in 'glamping': The bus was built with no expense spared and is coated from floor to ceiling in leather

Sartorial: Owners of velour suits, stripey blazers and Chelsea boots will find ample space to store their wardrobe, while the bathroom has gold taps and faucets

British racing champion Button owned the bus or eight years from 2003 until 2011 - and toured in it around the world during his title-winning season in 2009.

The bus was built with no expense spared and is coated from floor to ceiling in leather.

Mr Morris added: 'It was made especially for life on the race circuits of Europe and has been home to Formula One drivers including world champions Jacques Villeneuve and Jenson Button.

'With that in mind, guests can expect a top-of-the-range experience and be treated like a world champion.'

Daytona 500-winning Nascar driver Matt Kenseth is a proud owner of a similar vehicle.

Those with the budget to rent out the Icon can take advantage of an on board 20kw generator, air conditioning, underfloor heating, privacy glass, a lounge, 42in plasma TV with surround sound and DVD player, Sky TV and a Bose digital sound system including iPod dock and wifi.

Holidaymakers won't see much of the kitchen as they will have a Michelin-star chef, but they'll be glad to know the kitchen/galley area boasts gold fittings, a large American-style fridge freezer, convection oven and microwave. A washing machine and tumble dryer are on hand for cleaning muddy clothes should you venture outside the gilded confines of the Icon.

Other luxurious features include a granite floor, master bedroom, a dressing table and walk-in wardrobe, en-suite bathroom with gold fittings and another widescreen TV.

Guests without their own million-dollar motorhome can sleep on a fold-out bed and stargazers can enjoy an outdoor seating area, bespoke awning with starlight feature, patio flooring, luxury outdoor furniture and a BBQ available on request.
