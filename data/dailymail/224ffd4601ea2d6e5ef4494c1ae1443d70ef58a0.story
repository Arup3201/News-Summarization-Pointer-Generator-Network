A church has put its ‘God's love delivers’ belief into practice by asking parishioners to take out money from collection baskets instead of giving.

The Liquid Church in New Jersey gave away its usual Sunday collection of $30,000 cash in unmarked envelopes containing a $10, $20 or $50 bill.

Lead pastor Tim Lucas said they didn't have any problems at the service and there were no hordes of people who just came looking for free money.

He wanted the ‘reverse offering’ to teach churchgoers that faith in God - not government - is the only route out of the current financial crisis.

‘The success of this effort comes from empowering people to be the solution, instead of expecting the government to do it,’ Pastor Lucas said.

‘We're hoping this fosters an outbreak of generosity, that people creatively invest the money in good works to make themselves and their community better.

‘We believe the economic crisis is a spiritual issue, which is why we are moving forward with God's recovery plan.’

Big idea: Lead pastor Tim Lucas said they had no problems and there were not hordes of people who just came looking for free money

The Christian church has around 2,000 members and three branches in Morristown, Nutley, and New Brunswick.

Parishioners appeared to take the ‘do good deeds’ message to heart.

‘I think this is a fabulous idea,’ 
said Michelle Clifford of North Caldwell, who recently began attending 
services at the church.

She got an envelope with $10, which she planned to return to the church.

Ms Clifford said she was so inspired by the message that she would donate clothes and $20 of her own money to a local homeless shelter.

‘They took a strong step of faith which shows people that church isn't all about the money, it's about touching hearts,’ Ms Clifford said.

Liquid Church was first set up as a Bible class with 12 people in 1999, before they launched as an official church in 2007. Now about 2,000 people attend at three locations.

‘And that's what I saw today, a lot of people feeling blessed, excited about doing good things with the money they got.’

Church officials say they had heard of a church in California trying a similar ‘reverse collection’ tactic.

They thought it was a good idea at a time when so many people are struggling financially.

‘The national economy might be in the 
ditch, but at the end of the day, your personal economy is what 
matters,’ Pastor Rich Birch said.

which shows people that church isn't all about the money, it's about

‘The Bible teaches simplicity and living within your means, and that God gives us resources and trusts us to use them.

‘So in a real way it's saying God trusts us. It's a bit of a teaching metaphor, and when we literally give them money, it's saying God trusts us to use it properly.’

One churchgoer said she planned to use her money to buy cake supplies to bake goods for a fundraiser for flooding victims.
