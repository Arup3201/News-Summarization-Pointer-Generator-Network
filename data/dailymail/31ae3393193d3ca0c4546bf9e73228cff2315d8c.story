Former Cleveland Police Authority chairman Dave McLuckie (above) is facing a charge of perverting the course of justice after being accused of asking a friend to take his speeding points

A former police chief persuaded a friend to take speeding points for him so he would avoid jeopardising his chances of the top job, a court heard today.

Dave McLuckie, then vice-chairman of Cleveland Police Authority but on the brink of becoming chairman, needed a 'big favour' to help him avoid a driving ban, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

The 51-year-old, from North
Yorkshire, denies perverting the course of justice after being accused of asking his late friend Maurice Ward to take his three speeding points instead.

Mr McLuckie was caught doing 36mph in a
30mph zone in Cleveland in April 2005 in his black Peugeot.

He already had nine points on his licence for speeding and was facing a ban if he got three more, the jury heard.

Suspicion was only raised after Mr Ward died of cancer in 2012 and details of what he did for Mr McLuckie were discovered in his diary by his widow, prosecutor Nick Dry told the jury.

Mr Ward's daughter Donna told a local councillor about her discovery and the police were informed.

But Mr McLuckie told police after his arrest the allegation was 'motivated by malice' after the pair's friendship had 'soured'.

Mr Ward felt the police authority chairman had not visited him in hospital when he fell ill with the disease in 2007, the court heard.

Mr Dry said: 'The 
defendant was the vice chairman of the Cleveland Police Authority with 
the view to making the step up to being chairman.

'He also had nine points on his 
licence all accrued for previous speeding offences, a further three 
would lead to a driving disqualification.

'In
this circumstance the defendant turned to his then-friend Maurice Ward 
and asked him to do a big favour by taking the points and Mr Wardâ€™s 
licence was endorsed.'

Mr Dry added Mr
McLuckie didn't specifically deny being the driver, but claimed he had 
spoken to Mr Ward who agreed he had probably been driving the car 
on that occasion.

The car was registered and insured in Mr McLuckie's name.

Mrs 
Ward told the court the two families knew each other from living in the same village in Cleveland.

Her son began a relationship with 
McLuckie's daughter and the families would watch Middlesbrough FC in an 
executive box with the future police authority chairman.

The trial continues.
