It’s official, the UK is full of adoring mummy’s boys.

Men are more likely to buy their mother a gift this Mother’s Day (47 per cent) than bought their partner a gift last Valentines (44 per cent), suggesting mum is still their number one girl.

Men up and down the country claim it is easier to buy presents for their mum than their partner, with more than a quarter (27 per cent) citing their other half as the most difficult person to buy for.

British boys, like Russell Brand and One Direction's Louis Tomlinson, are always mummy's boys at heart (left, Russell with his mother Barbara Elizabeth, and right, Louis with mother Johannah Poulston)

On average, men admit to spending £26 on a gift for Mother’s Day, with one in ten (10 per cent) spending £50 or more on their mother.

And it would seem that the boys are edging ahead of the girls when it comes to getting in their mother’s good books, with women admitting to spending slightly less on a Mother’s Day gift (£23).

And with more than a quarter of Britons (27 per cent) admitting that they usually purchase gifts using their credit card, choosing the right card is more important than ever.

Nerys Lewis, head of credit cards at Confused.com, who conducted the research, comments: 'It seems that we do indeed have a nation of mummy’s boys! While it is traditionally daughters who are seen to be the more caring of the sexes, this year it is boys who will be splashing out on their Mums and putting the girls to shame.'

We imagine Simon Cowell will be spending more than the British average of £26 on his mother Julie Cowell (right) this Mother's Day
