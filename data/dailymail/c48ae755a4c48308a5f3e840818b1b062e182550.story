A manhunt is underway after two plain-clothes police officers were shot and wounded while driving through a South Los Angeles neighborhood in what has been described as a 'targeted' attack.

The officers, who have not been identified, were reportedly fired at near the intersection of 65th Street and Broadway on Sunday evening as they drove in an unmarked car.

They subsequently returned fire, causing several suspects to scatter, police said. The officers were treated at the scene for minor gunshot wounds, while a number of people were detained by police.

Now, a search has been launched for two male suspects who were allegedly involved in the shooting and are on the run. Dozens of officers, including SWAT members, were at the scene Sunday night.

Manhunt: Police are currently conducting a block-to-block search of Los Angeles' Florence neighborhood with a K-9 unit after two plain-clothes police officers were shot and wounded while driving through the area

Police at the scene: They subsequently returned fire, causing several suspects to scatter, police said. The officers were treated at the scene for minor  wounds, while a number of people were detained by police

Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Detective Meghan Aguila said the  officers are thought to have been specifically targeted in the attack, which occurred in the Florence area shortly before 5.45pm.

'Of course, because it's an active scene, that's our preliminary investigation,' she said. 'There's going to be several thorough interviews of the officers. But right now they believe they were the target.'

The shooting comes just three days after two police officers were shot and wounded during a protest in Ferguson, Missouri. They were successfully treated for shoulder and facial injuries respectively.

Jeffrey Williams, a 20-year-old African-American, has since been arrested on a number of charges relating to the incident on Thursday night, including two counts of assault on a police officer.

It also comes two days after an armed man accused of kidnapping and driving in a stolen vehicle was shot on live television by LA County sheriff's authorities following a  car chase on Friday afternoon.

In Sunday's shooting, the officers were dressed in plain clothes and driving near the intersection when they were fired at, Det Aguila told KTLA 5. A large part of the neighborhood has been cordoned off.

Police were conducting a block-to-block search, accompanied by a K-9 unit, on Sunday night. But despite their efforts, two suspects still remain at large. They are both male, officials told ABC 7.

'We are asking the public to shelter in place and notify police if they see any unusual activity in their houses or yards,' Det Aguilar said from the scene, where three armored SWAT vehicles are parked.

Sargaent Cory Meisner said the two officers were treated at the intersection after suffering only graze wounds in the shooting. They are both said to be in a stable condition, according to CBS. 

Eyewitness Junior Moore, 54, told the Times that he had heard '20 shots' during the attack. Dozens of other bystanders were pictured gathered at the scene, alongside police and SWAT officers.

The people who were detained by police on Sunday night will now be questioned about the shooting. Neither they nor the male suspects have yet been identified. An investigation is ongoing.

On Sunday night, anti-police protesters resumed demonstrations outside a police station in Ferguson, Missouri, following the arrest of Williams, who reportedly admitted to officials he had fired a weapon.

However, the suspect claimed he had been trying to hit someone else with whom he was having a dispute - and accidentally hit the officers instead, St Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch said.

'We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,' the prosecutor said at a press conference, adding there might have been other people in a vehicle Williams is accused of shooting from. 

The Ferguson attack sent a fresh jolt of tension through a city that became a symbol of racial conflict after black teenager Michael Brown was killed by white officer Darren Wilson last summer.

It is unknown whether any  suspects were hit in Sunday's gunfire.
