THE billionaire founder of Phones 4u has launched a Twitter tirade against ‘ruthless’ mobile phone networks, accusing them of forcing the company into administration.

John Caudwell, who sold the business in 2006, blasted both Vodafone and EE after they ended contracts to supply handsets through the chain’s 550 stores.

But Vodafone claimed it was unable to negotiate competitive rates with Phones 4u after its private equity firm owners loaded the company with £505million of debt – and used £200million to pay shareholders a dividend.

On the high street: Staff talk to each other as they wait outside the Phones 4U store in Chingford, Essex, today

Yesterday the jobs of 5,596 employees were
 threatened when the mobile phone supplier was put into administration.

The firm is being threatened with closure, despite the fact that it has 
generated sales of more than £1billion a year and a profit of 
£105million.

All Phones 4u stores will now remain closed while administrators 
investigate whether the chain has a future, and check to see whether 
there are sufficient funds to pay staff the wages they are owed.

The company’s demise has created confusion among customers, but the firm
 said existing contracts will be honoured and has promised that people 
who paid money up front for new handsets will be refunded.

Concern: Founder John Caudwell, who sold his stake for £1.5bn in 2006, said he was 'desperately worried'

Phones 4u was founded by entrepreneur John
 Caudwell in 1987, who sold the firm for £1.46billion in 2006 to 
Providence Equity Partners before it was bought by private equity firm 
BC Partners in 2011.

Flamboyant Mr Caudwell, who lives with partner Claire – a former model –
 vented his fury at the company’s demise on Twitter.

In a series of 
damning messages he wrote: ‘I am sickened and saddened for nearly 6000 
wonderful employees who made Phones 4u into a great business. #ruthless 
vodafone #ruthlessEE.’

He went on to say: ‘Such a sad day for 
Phones 4u and all its employees! Brought to its knees by ruthless 
so-called “partners” moving in for the kill!!!’

However Mr Caudwell was also critical of private equity firm BC 
Partners, which bought the firm using mainly borrowed money for 
£600million.

He wrote: ‘Unfortunately, combination of short-term private
 equity strategy combined with ruthless network “partners” and 
government killed Phones 4u.’

A Vodafone spokesman denied any inappropriate behaviour, saying: ‘We 
were told by Phones 4u management that they had little commercial 
flexibility due to their debt repayment obligations.’

EE said its 
decision not to renew its contract beyond September 2015 was driven by 
uncertainty over the firm’s long-term viability.

But Stefano Quadrio Curzio, from BC Partners, claimed the phone 
companies’ decision was ‘designed to inflict the maximum damage’, and 
had left the board with no alternative but to go into administration.

Yesterday employee Neil Douglas wrote online: ‘Hard-working people like 
myself who go to work to provide the best customer experience possible 
are about to lose their job by no fault of their own.’

And Phones 4u chief executive David Kassler said: ‘Today is a very sad 
day for our customers and our staff.’ He added: ‘A good company making 
profits of over £100million and employing thousands of decent people has
 been forced into administration. The result will be less competition, 
less choice and higher prices for UK customers.’

I ordered an iPhone 6, what happens now?

IF you have ordered an iPhone 6 – or any phone – and it has not yet been dispatched, then your request will be cancelled and your money refunded. If the phone has been dispatched it should arrive as expected. 

How do I return faulty goods? 

Stores will remain closed until the administrators decide how the company will be dealt with. The website is also offline, but you can still call 0844 8712253 for customer services, and if you bought your mobile using a credit card and paid more than £100 you can ask your card company for a refund. If you paid by debit card you have similar protection under chargeback rules.

Will my mobile still work if they go bust?

Yes. Most people who bought a phone with Phones 4u are actually customers of networks such as EE, O2, Vodafone and Three. You will be able to use your phone as normal.

Will my bill increase?

Phones 4u says any contract agreed with the shop should remain the same. But until administrators have calculated the assets of the company, there is no guarantee of this.

Is my mobile phone insurance still valid? 

Anyone who purchased mobile phone insurance from Phones 4u should still be protected as the policy is operated by a separate firm.

Where do I go now to compare prices? 

Phones 4u was one of the few stores which offered contracts from a number of networks under one roof. The only major alternatives now are Carphone Warehouse, Currys and internet comparison sites.

 Bled to death by the private equity leeches

Consumer choice and jobs on the High Street have once again been placed in jeopardy by the rapacious behaviour of one of Britain’s private equity firms – which load the companies they buy with debt, then cut costs to the bone in an attempt to make instant profits, Alex Brummer writes.

This time the group concerned is BC Partners, owners of no-frills Phones 4u, which has fallen into administration.

The collapse of Phones 4u will give the shrinking band of mobile phone operators – Vodafone, Spanish-controlled O2 and EE (forged from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile in 2010) – an even tighter grip over the hugely valuable cell phone market.

Most consumers, bamboozled by the vast array of tariffs and phones, have traditionally turned to companies like Phones 4u and Carphone Warehouse for neutral advice.

The companies offered a path through a maze that only the most tech-savvy consumer could master on their own. But cost-cutting and a failure to invest coincided with the rise of smartphones being sold as design icons.

So while Phones 4u stores began to look increasingly utilitarian and downmarket, the mobile phone operators turned their own stores into high-tech emporiums selling high-priced items of beauty.

This coincided with regulators clamping down on mobile call charges. Phones 4u’s pricing model had always been to discount the phones themselves, and make up the shortfall on high charges for calls.

But the regulators’ clampdown means, increasingly, that phone users today tend to pay more for the device – and they go to the phone operators’ more upmarket stores to do so.

Phones 4U is threatened with closure

Many believe that the phone network operators deliberately picked a fight with Phones 4u so that they could expand their own business operations by picking up some of its stores and staff on the cheap.

The company has heaped opprobrium on the operators O2 – which pulled out of Phones 4u stores in January – EE and Vodafone. The big three cancelled their contracts with Phones 4u mainly after disputes about the share of profits they received for allowing the company to sell contracts on their networks. This was certainly a key factor behind the decision to call in the administrators.

However, it is impossible to ignore the dead hand of private equity. In the eight years since John Caudwell sold Phones 4u to its first private equity outfit Doughty Hanson, the retailer has been passed around among the private equity princelings like a second-hand vase at a car boot sale.

After Doughty Hanson, it was sold to private equity firm Providence Equity Partners. Then in 2011 it was sold on to its current private equity concern BC Partners, a derivation of the collapsed Barings merchant bank. All of these deals were financed using debt, and the priority of the owners has been to run the shops for immediate profit. The lack of investment in staff and store development has proved disastrous.

While Carphone recruited graduates, Phones 4u did not. Its staff were younger, less qualified and engaged in high-pressure tactics including ‘streetfighting’ – a practice of accosting would-be customers on the street. Sales targets were raised while commissions paid to staff were allegedly cut.

Just to add salt to the wounds, BC Partners took on £200million of extra debts last year so they could pay their backers a special one-off dividend...of £200million. In effect, they milked the company for all they could while running it into the ground. In the end, even though the company was still trading profitably, it was left with little option but to close.

The immediate beneficiary of Phones 4u’s demise appears to be Carphone Warehouse. Shares in its parent Dixons rose on the news of Phone 4u’s collapse, and it has promised to save 800 jobs at Phone 4u franchises in stores controlled by Dixons.

However the concern must be that the phone network operators which left Phones 4u high and dry – to increase their stranglehold over the market – will eventually treat Carphone with the same contempt.

On the other hand, Dixons Carphone believes it is in a stronger position as it is one of the country’s biggest distributors of Samsung, Apple and Sony products. Phones 4u never took that course – with a private equity firm leeching away its lifeblood, it was not able to.
