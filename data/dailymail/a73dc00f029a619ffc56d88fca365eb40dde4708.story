A Norwegian father has built 3D printer out of Legos to make pancakes.

Miguel Valenzuela, from Oslo, Norway, and his PancakeBot and tour the country making presentations to school children, and he has made the plans to his brilliant invention available online.

The father of two wrote on an IndieGoGo fundraising page that his unique invention was inspired by his daughters and built the contraption to help inspire children to become interested in engineering.

Made from Legos: Valenzuela's original PancakeBot is made from a common children's toy

The original idea for PancakeBot came in 2010 after Valenzuela read about a British designer who created a pancake stamping machine also made out of the plastic bricks.

Once his daughters heard about it, they had to have one of their own.

Videos posted to YouTube show the machine ‘printing’ words and designs such as hearts and galloping horses onto a griddle below.

Amazing: The device can be used to make designed pancakes or regular flapjacks, the only limit is the imagination

According to the PancakeBot website, 
where the 115-page instructions can be downloaded for free, the 3D 
printer uses AutoCAD to draw the designs that the device draws onto the 
hot griddle below.

Valenzuela has actually made two of the printers, one of acrylic and another out of Legos, but it is the Lego one that he is happy to share the plans to for anyone who is interested.

Valenzuela tool his device stateside while attending the Maker Faire outside San Francisco last week.

The Lego chef says he was inspired to attend this year’s festival because a young girl who saw him in New York at another Maker Faire professed her love for PancakeBot.

Inspiring: Valenzuela says children love PancakeBot, and that he hopes to use it to inspire them to a career in engineering

‘This is why we came to the Maker Faire, to see PancakeBot,’ he recalls her saying on the IndieGoGo page.

‘That really touched our hearts,’ he continues. ‘The idea that PancakeBot was getting kids of both genders excited about making and helping expose kids to engineering concepts and food.’

Valenzuela encourages people to hack his invention for even more uses, and says the only limit is the user’s imagination.
