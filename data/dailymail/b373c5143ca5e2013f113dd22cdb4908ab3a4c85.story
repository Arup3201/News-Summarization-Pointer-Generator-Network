A student at the University of Melbourne, she was sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital for emergency surgery.

Jones was killed instantly.

A second unidentified woman in her mid 30s was also killed in the accident.

The siblings were walking to class at roughly 3 p.m. and were passing an old brewery when a 50-foot section of the building's wall collapsed.

Authorities are investigating whether the wall should've been demolished sooner, as they say it collapsed due to a freak gust of wind

Police blamed a freak wind, the Herald Sun reported.

An unidentified North Melbourne man said he ran to help upon hearing the collapse.

'I took my jacket and placed it over the young lady to try and keep her
warm,' he said. 'Then I knelt down in the bicycle path. I was taking 
her pulse on her 
neck and her wrist as there was a nurse above me wearing blue latex 
gloves. She kept asking whether or not the young lady was breathing.'

Bridget was also trapped under the rubble and remains in critical condition after emergency surgery

On social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, friends, family, and well-wishers praised Jones' brave action.

'Zander, a true hero,' one wrote.

Flowers, teddy bears, and candles were left at the scene of the accident in memorial.

An investigation is now underway to determine whether the wall should have been torn down sooner.

The rest of it was demolished that night.
