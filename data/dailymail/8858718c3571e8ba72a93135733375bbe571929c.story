David Ginola's campaign to become the next FIFA president appears to be at an end.

The former Tottenham Hotspur and France winger failed to meet strict FIFA regulations needed by January 29 to run against Sepp Blatter and  will refund all donations towards his £2.3million target.

The 47-year-old with no known football administration experience had to prove to FIFA he had played an 'active role' for two of the last five years, and that he had the support of five national associations.

The idea to back a candidate originated from Paddy Power and David Ginola, being paid £250,000 by the bookmakers to run, apparently topped their shortlist.

Paddy Power were inviting people to become members on www.teamginola.com to pledge support and cash. Paid-for memberships range from £5 to £40,000.

Paddy Power were aiming to raise £2.3million by the end of February to fund the campaign.

The message on www.teamginola.com read: 'A huge thank you for supporting Team Ginola. The crowdfunding page is now closed. 

'All donations will be returned to those that have pledged.

'The fight is not over. Football still needs to change. I urge you to continue to vocalise your craving for change in football in whatever way you can.

'Let it be known that no matter how small you think your voice may be alone, if we speak together we will be heard. Whilst FIFA may not be an open democracy for the footballing public, our opinions will be heeded, only if we persist.'

Yet Ginola tweeted after the announcement to insist he was not prepared to stop fighting for change in football. 'Not giving up, still in the race to reboot football! Will not give up... final nomination results might not be known before 8th February...' he wrote. 

There were doubts about Ginola's running since he announced his intention to challenge Blatter less than two weeks ago on January 16. That press conference was backed by bookmakers Paddy Power - known for their high-profile PR stunts, but not for major sports announcements.

Paddy Power himself admitted it was their idea to back a candidate and that Ginola, being paid £250,000 by the bookmakers to run, topped their shortlist. But he  confirmed on Thursday their involvement with Team Ginola had come to an end.

Power said: 'We're really proud to have been involved in giving the Team Ginola bid a good leg up, but the plan was always for us to step away from the action at this point – and we're sticking to that.

'There's been a brilliant response from the fans to the campaign, which is everything we hoped for given David's manifesto is all about giving the game back to them.

'Even though our part in Team Ginola is over, we're all rooting for David in his continuing bid to take on the FIFA giants.'

Blatter will still face competition to win a fifth term, however, after four others declared an interest in running against the 78-year-old - FIFA vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, former FIFA official Jerome Champagne, former head of Chilean football, Harold Mayne-Nicholls, and Luis Figo.

Ginola's backing down comes the same day the Football Association formally nominate Prince Ali of Jordan for the FIFA presidency.
