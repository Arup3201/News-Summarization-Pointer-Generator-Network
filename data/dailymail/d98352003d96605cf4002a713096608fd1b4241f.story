NATO's planned £850 million headquarters could be scrapped as the consortium building it in a posh Brussels suburb is hovering on the brink of bankruptcy.

The new headquarters - seen by critics as a monument to the ego of outgoing NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen - has run into 'serious financial difficulties' according to the German news magazine Spiegel, which claims to have accessed paperwork relating to the complex.

The magazine claims BAM Alliance's money problems, which it says Rasmussen is aware of but is yet to inform NATO member states about, stems from a simple miscalculation over subcontractor costs and that without an additional £200 million funding, the entire project will grind to a halt.

Shambles: NATO's planned £850 million headquarters could be scrapped as the consortium building it in a posh Brussels suburb is hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and needs a £200million cash injection

The new headquarters has run into 'serious financial difficulties' according to German news magazine Spiegel

Spiegel said: 'Rasmussen is aware of the problem but hasn't seen fit yet to inform the public about it, meaning the taxpayers of the 28 NATO member states.' 

'At a meeting of NATO's Deputies Committee on December 19, Rasmussen's staff asked that the issue be dealt with 'confidentially,' it added.

The building has already more than 
doubled in cost and it is unlikely that NATO would want the PR disaster 
that would follow if the project was scrapped.

The new building is seen by critics as a vanity project by outgoing NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen

German ambassador, Martin Erdmann, 
told Berlin in a confidential memorandum: 'We pointed to the disastrous 
effect on the image of the alliance if construction were to stop and if 
NATO appeared to be incapable of punctually completing a construction 
project that was decided at the NATO summit of government leaders in 
April 1999 in Washington.'

'The risk of a further cost increase is already palpable,' Erdmann added. 

The consortium's spokesman told Spiegel: 'Several unforeseen circumstances including significantly increased security requirements by NATO had led to the construction exceeding the initially agreed sum.' 

He refused comment on the looming bankruptcy.

British taxpayers are currently set to pick up around 15 per cent of the bill for the new NATO headquarters with the increased costs almost certain to push that figure up even higher.

Any additional fee is bound to be controversial at a time when the Coalition is making unpopular cuts to the country's defence budget.

Speaking to the Telegraph, Daniel Hannan, Conservative MEP for South East England, said: 'I'm afraid that, after a while, the primary goal of every international bureaucracy becomes its own expansion and comfort'

'It's true of the UN and FIFA and the EU, and it would be surprising if it weren't also true of NATO' he added.

Flags blow in the wind in front of the current NATO headquarters - which is also in an expensive part of the Belgian capital Brussels. British taxpayers will pick up at least 15 per cent of the bill for the new building
