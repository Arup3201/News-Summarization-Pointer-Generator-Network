It seems everyone is developing some form of wearable tech this year and the latest comes from phone maker Huawei.

The TalkBand 1 comes with a 1.4-inch flexible display, has built-in GPS and a pedometer and will monitor sleep patterns, like the Fitbit.

It looks similar to the fitness bands released from the likes of Nike and Adidas, yet acts more like a Samsung Gear smartwatch – letting users make calls from their wrist.

Unlike the Gear range, however, Huawei doesn’t limit the TalkBand’s use to only its own handsets.

The fitness band connects to any current Android and iOS device.

It syncs wirelessly with devices simply by touching the two gadgets together, via near-field communication (NFC) and the TalkBand 1 is sold with a Bluetooth 4.1 earpiece.

This means users don’t have to hold their wrist to their ear to make and receive calls.

What’s more, the earpiece is hidden inside the band for convenience and the whole device is IP7 water resistant, meaning it can withstand splashes in the shower, for example and survive being submerged in shallow water.

The Talkband 1 will go on sale next month in China before being rolled out to Russia, Japan, Latin America and Europe. It costs €99 (£80/$135).

Another company jumping on the phone and fitness tracker hybrid bandwagon is Alcatel, with its OneTouch Pop Fit.

Many people already use their phone as a fitness tracker, so Alcatel has attempted to combine the two.

The Alcatel OneTouch Pop Fit is a small Android phone with a 2.8-inch screen and weighs 78g.

It’s sold with an armband that can be worn while running, for example, and works with GPS and fitness apps including Runkeeper, as well as music apps such as Spotify.

The Pop Fit additionally has sensitive keys that make it easier to control during exercise along with a transparent flip cover meaning users can keep track of their progress at a glance.

Elsewhere it has a 2MP camera, 1GHz processor and comes in 16GB and 32GB versions.

Alcatel has not announced a release date or price for the PopFit but it will be sold in red, pink, grey, turquoise and yellow.
