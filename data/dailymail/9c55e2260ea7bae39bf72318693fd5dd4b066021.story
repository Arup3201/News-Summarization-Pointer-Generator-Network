This is the jaw-dropping hidden utopia that a Bradford couple chanced upon on holiday.

The underground cave is showered with sunlight that pours through two huge entrances, allowing trees up to 50 metres tall to flourish.

Tucked behind a mountain in Vietnam, Son Doong - meaning river mountain - has sat peacefully under the human radar for as long as records can show.

Caves are defined as 'big enough for a human to fit inside'. Towering above its minuscule explorers, this cave has shocked nature experts.

The couple heard about the cave from a local man who had taken shelter from a storm in the entrance to Son Doong, in the mountains of Quang Binh 20 years ago

The first public tour in August 2013 camps on the floor of the cave. Mr and Mrs Limbert were joined by six tourists, 16 porters, two UK guides, a Vietnamese English-speaking guide, two National Park rangers and a porter manager

Measuring 5.5 miles long, it is home to a
lush green forest, cascading waterfalls, giant stalagmites and stalactites and
a river. The cavern is so large, a 40-story skyscraper could fit within its
walls.

The luscious underground forest is home to
all sorts of cave-dwelling creatures from flying foxes to monkeys.

The cave was first explored in 2009 by
Howard Limbert, 56, and his wife Deb, 53.

The couple, who met at a school caving club, took a gamble four years ago when they dropped their NHS jobs in Bradford to travel the world in
search of new and exciting caves.

They heard about the cave from a local man, Ho Khanh, who had taken shelter
from a storm in the entrance to Son Doong, in the mountains of Quang Binh in
Vietnam 20 years ago.

He heard the sounds of a powerful river
and rushing wind, but was too afraid to venture further in.

Mr Khanh told the Limberts about his
discovery when he led them as a guide through the Vietnamese mountains in 2009.

Mr Limbert said: 'Son Doong is unlike any
other cave on the planet.

'We were so lucky to have the chance
of being the first people to see this new wonder of the world.

'It is always very exciting to
explore somewhere where no one has ever visited, but to have the chance to
explore Son Doong was very special indeed.'

The couple, married for 34 years, relocated to Vietnam
permanently and set up a business leading tour groups to the heart of the cave.

There have now been 25 specialised expeditions into
Son Doong since the cave was first discovered.

And last month, in a groundbreaking adventure, Mr and Mrs Limbert led the first public tour.

Six tourists went on the
first trip, accompanied by 16 porters, two UK guides, a
Vietnamese English-speaking guide, two National Park rangers and a porter
manager.

To enter Son Doong the group of
international tourists from Britain, Australia, the USA and Norway, had to
abseil down through the thick forest under the caves entrance.

Mr Limbert said: 'We have probably lived
in the cave now for over four months in total.

'The tour is incredibly popular and
all clients taken so far say it is the greatest adventure on the planet.'

requests to join expeditions into the world's largest cave and expect all 220
places on tours next year to be snapped up fast.

The couple used to work for the NHS as
biomedical scientists and spent most their holidays on caving expeditions.

Mr Limbert said: 'We have both been
exploring caves for most of our adult life and it has enabled us to visit some
wonderful places in the world and meet some fantastic people. We are lucky that
we both have the same interest.

'We explored the caves of the UK
during our first few years of caving and still continue to explore the
fascinating caves of Britain.

'We caved in Europe and then later in
Mexico, Borneo, Australia and New Zealand.

'We first visited Vietnam on a caving
expedition in 1990 and now we have explored over 200m of new unexplored caves
during the last 23 years of our work in the country.'

The intrepid couple believe there may be a
larger cave for them to discover yet.

Mr Limbert said: 'We still believe that
an even larger cave could be found in the remote mountains in central Vietnam.

'We are leading an expedition of
British cavers in March and April next year to continue our work in the area
and hopefully find another cave larger than Son Doong if that is possible.

'We have only explored around a
quarter of the remote mountains and our guides have found many entrances for us
to visit.

'Hopefully early next year we will
have the chance to explore more amazing caves in the area.'
