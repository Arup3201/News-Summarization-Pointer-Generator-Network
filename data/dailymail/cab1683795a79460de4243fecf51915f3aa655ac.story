Self-proclaimed superhero Phoenix Jones, the trained fighter who patrols the streets of Seattle preventing crime, has disbanded his Avengers-style posse of fellow crime fighters because too many of them weren’t up to the task and were carrying illegal weapons.

Jones announced that he was disbanding the 20-strong Rain City Superhero Movement (RCSM) via Facebook on Thursday with a statement in which he admitted he had lent his civilian crime-fighting training and trust to some of the wrong people.

Phoenix Jones - real name Ben Fodor – first gained attention in 2010 after witnesses spotted him intervening in various crimes throughout the city in his gold and black costume.

His band of costumed vigilantes started to grow and early recruits had to have military or mixed martial arts experience. They carried Tasers, night sticks and pepper spray, but strictly no firearms or illegal weapons.

Seattle police didn’t approve of them, but they gained the cops’ seemingly reluctant tolerance.

Last year Phoenix Jones announced he was hiring, but according to Thursday’s statement his efforts to grow the Superhero Movement has since gone awry.

‘I started fighting crime years ago and inspired a lot of people to do the same.

'I really thought that having a large group of civilian crime fighters was a good idea,' wrote Jones.

'I was wrong, it takes a certain type of person to do this job correctly and unfortunately I have inspired, worked with, and even taught some of the wrong kinds of people.'

He went on to explain that several members couldn’t meet minimum fitness requirements or medical training, while others still lacked professionalism such as refusing to give police their identity.

‘Yea, the team's over,’ Jones told KING5. ‘The fact that we're being less unified, that sucks.’

‘Illegal knives, pepper grenades, smoke bombs, really crazy stuff,' said Jones. 'A lot of things we do are non-negotiable.'

Jones has decided that it is too risky for their brand to have associations with groups that don't adhere to those standards.

‘Anytime any superhero does anything wrong, my name gets mentioned,' Jones added.

Only four superheroes have been allowed to stay with Jones as he rebuilds RCSM with an updated logo.

'If you don't see us, it's not official. It's not us,' Jones said.

Jones says isn't opposed to welcoming old members back into the fold, but they must meet his requirements for superhero activism, like five pull-ups and 25 sit-ups in two minutes and run 2.5 miles in 30 minutes.
