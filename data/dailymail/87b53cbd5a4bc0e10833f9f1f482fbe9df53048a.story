The sheer savagery of the CIA torture programme was exposed to all the world last night.

Cruel and inhuman techniques – euphemistically referred to as ‘enhanced interrogation’ – were used to try to break more than 100 Islamic terror suspects.

Staff at the US intelligence agency were given around $200million (£130million) to use any means necessary to elicit information in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

Shackled: A military policeman gives water to chained prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, the US base in Cuba

Among the torturers were agents with backgrounds so violent and abusive they should have been barred from the agency altogether, according to a Senate report.

Secret jails known as ‘black sites’ were turned into dungeons in a string of countries apparently willing to turn a blind eye.

Prior to the report it was known that detainees were subjected to waterboarding, hooded beatings and sleep deprivation.

But yesterday, the committee described in chilling detail how this violent coercion spiralled into acts of sadistic cruelty.

In the first months of the programme, a beating left one suspect in hospital on life support and unable to communicate.

Another died from hypothermia, naked and chained to a concrete floor. A third was told by his interrogator that he would not escape alive as ‘we can never let the world know what I have done to you’.

The methods in question, based on ‘torturous’ techniques used by Cold War regimes, were already known to lead to false confessions. And so it proved. The CIA, led by two inexperienced psychologists, spent seven years torturing suspects for information that was of little value.

Almost every section of the 499-page report contains deeply disturbing revelations:

Forced to stand for hours with broken legs

Detainees – some with broken legs – were forced to stand in stress-inducing positions for hours and bullet wounds were left untreated. 

Victims were interrogated non-stop for weeks with some prevented from sleeping for up to 180 hours at a time.

One was subjected to 66 hours of ‘standing sleep deprivation’ before the CIA realised he was the wrong man and released him. Another suspect was confined to a coffin-sized box for a total of 266 hours.

Some were shackled with their hands above their heads, forced to walk around naked or hooded and dragged up and down corridors while being beaten.

Stripped naked and chained to the floor

One of the most notorious sites located in Afghanistan became known as the ‘salt pit’ among the Americans and the ‘dark prison’ by former captives.

Opened in 2002, and referred to as Cobalt in the report, it was described as a ‘dungeon’ by its own chief of interrogations.

The site was run by a junior officer with no relevant experience and who had ‘issues’ in his background that should have disqualified him from the CIA.

It was here that an inmate died from hypothermia and prisoners with broken legs were kept standing. Rooms were flooded with bright light and white noise to disorientate inmates.

Anally fed: Alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed was 'tortured with a rectal tube'

Force fed through a rectal tube

In one of the most shocking acts, CIA staff used rectal feeding and hydration tubes as instruments of torture. The use of the technique for control is highlighted in the case of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.

The report describes how a detainee’s ‘lunch tray’ of hummous, pasta with sauce, nuts and raisins was ‘pureed’ and ‘rectally infused’ when he refused to eat it.

Another suspect was fed via nasal tube, a process one lawyer described as like ‘having a razor-blade pulled down your throat’.

Drowning, vomiting and convulsions

The full horror of waterboarding, in which a damp cloth and trickle of water is used to simulate drowning, is laid bare in the Senate report.

Officials rubbished claims by the agency that it used the technique on only three detainees. They described their horror at seeing a ‘well worn’ waterboard, surrounded by buckets of water, at a detention site where the CIA said the technique was not used.

Victims, including Sheikh Mohammed, suffered convulsions and vomiting. He was waterboarded at least 183 times, which the report describes as escalating into a ‘series of near drownings’.

In his case operatives abandoned the damp cloth. Instead they used their hands to form a standing pool of water over his mouth to increase the sensation of dying.

Another victim was left completely unresponsive with bubbles rising from his open mouth after he was violently waterboarded at a black site in Thailand. The treatment left hardened CIA employees distraught and concerned about the legality of what they had witnessed. Several asked to be transferred afterwards.

You will leave this place in a coffin

CIA officers routinely threatened to harm detainees’ children, sexually abuse their mothers, and in one case ‘cut [a detainee’s] mother’s throat’. Several suspects were led to believe they would die in custody, with one told he would leave in a coffin.

Another was told his mother would be brought in front of him and sexually abused if he did not cooperate. The report revealed that some of the staff should never have been working for the agency in the first place.

They were already known for engaging in ‘inappropriate’ interrogations or had ‘anger management issues’. One had admitted to a sexual assault.

The psychological ‘masterminds’

Two contract psychologists were at the root of the entire programme, devising techniques and playing a central role in managing the programme.

Neither had any experience as an interrogator, or any specialised knowledge of Al Qaeda, counter-terrorism or languages. Nevertheless they developed ‘learned helplessness’ methods, in which prisoners are totally dominated. They personally interrogated the most prized suspects.

In 2005, they formed a company for the work and received £52million before Barack Obama terminated the contract in 2009.

The 26 who should not have been held

The CIA claimed it held about 100 people but the Senate investigation found at least 119 were in the agency’s custody.

One aide said they lost track and ‘didn’t really know who they were holding’ because of the chaotic and unmonitored way in which the prisons were set up.

Emails were uncovered in which CIA personnel were ‘surprised’ to find some suspects in their custody. At least 26 detainees were wrongfully held.

The ill-treatment left many detainees exhibiting symptoms of mental illness, including hallucinations, paranoia, convulsions, self-harm and mutilation.

One prisoner slashed his wrists and attempted to chew into a vein through his elbow and cut his arm with a filed toothbrush.

In 2003 one senior operative described it as a ‘train [wreck] waiting to happen’ and that ‘I intend to get the hell off the train before it happens’.

The report demolishes claims that the abuse of inmates in Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison in the second Gulf War were isolated incidents.
