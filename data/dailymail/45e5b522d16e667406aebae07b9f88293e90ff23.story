A passenger flying with Alaska Airlines spotted something in the clouds that made him reach for the camera. 

Tom Korocz was travelling out of Seattle's Sea-Tac airport when he noticed what appeared to be an image of the Alaska Airlines mascot in the clouds. 

The photo was posted online which shows the cloud right next the aircraft's tail.

It was circulated over the internet last weekend.

It is not known exactly who the man is on the tail of the plane but it has been claimed that it is an Eskimo called Oliver Amouak (Tahkhok) and is often referred to as the 'Happy Face'.

Alaska Airlines has not disclosed the identify of the Eskimo in their logo and denies that it is for certain Oliver Amouak.

Oliver’s
 granddaughter, Brenda Ritchey wrote a book compiling Oliver Amouak’s 
family stories of their own traditional, happy and practical lives.

The company that ultimately became Alaska Airlines was born in 1932 when Linious 'Mac' McGee painted 'McGee Airways' on the side of a three-passenger Stinson and started flying out of Anchorage.

In 1934, McGee merged with Star Air Service, creating the largest airline in Alaska with 22 aircraft.
