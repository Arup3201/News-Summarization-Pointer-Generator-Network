Capturing the beauty of nature used to require some serious kit - a dedicated camera complete with an array of state-of-the art lenses.

But the professional's monopoly on breathtaking nature photography could be about to be over.

News photographer Mikael Buck has captured a stunning portfolio of images using just his smartphone as a camera - although he does rely on a detachable lens to zoom in on ice crystals on leaves and insects' hypnotic multi-faceted eyes.

Renowned news photographer Mikael Buck created stunning images by using his smartphone and a lens attachment. This picture shows the head of a purple emperor butterfly on show at the Haslemere Museum in Surrey, including its proboscis - a tubular mouth part used for feeding and sucking

His photos show the iridescent cells of dragonfly wings, furry antennae and ice crystals forming on leaves, which were shot in the woods of London's Hampstead Heath. 

The London-based photographer used Sony’s QX1 lens-style camera, which retails at around £250. It clips onto a smartphone or tablet, as well as a tripod to keep his smartphone steady while talking the close-up shots.

The first set of images taken on Hampstead Heath, show crisp ice crystals forming on leaves, which would be almost impossible to capture with a standard smartphone camera.

Mr Buck used the QX1 and an extra macro lens to reveal the intricate ice structures and kept the same set up to photograph beetles and butterflies in microscopic detail at the Haslemere Museum, which has over 65,000 insects in its collection.

The London-based photographer used Sony’s QX1 lens-style camera, which is designed to work with a smartphone or tablet, as well as a tripod (pictured) to keep his smartphone steady when talking the close-up shots

He photographed the cellular structure of a golden ring dragonfly's wings, hairs on the bottom of a common green birdwing butterfly's wings, a close up of a purple emperor butterfly's eyes and the iridescence on the wings of the same species.

The QX1 works with a smartphone or tablet. It can be used with camera lenses from any manufacturer with the aid of an adapter and costs £249 ($377).

Mr Buck said: ‘Being an editorial photographer, I am used to capturing pictures on a DSLR to accompany the daily headlines so to use something like the QX1 was certainly a change.

‘The sheer detail that can be captured using this lens-style camera is incredible’

Mr Buck said ‘The sheer detail that can be captured using this lens-style camera [the QX1] is incredible’. Here, ice crystals are pictured up close in the undergrowth of Hampstead Heath, London. They almost look like something from a chemistry experiment

Tiny hairs on the bottom of a common green birdwing butterfly's wings are pictured left, together with a close-up of the insect's head (right). Here you can see its compound eyes, which allow butterflies to see ultraviolet light as well as a mosaic view of the world around them

Mr Buck said: ‘Using the QX1 and macro lenses I was able to capture shots of everything from the individual crystals of ice on a frost covered leaf (pictured) to the tiny cells on a dragonfly's wings’

‘Although the cameras in smartphones are getting better all the time, there is a whole world of microscopic detail that you could never photograph with them until now due to the limited nature of their fixed lenses.

‘Using the QX1 and macro lenses I was able to capture shots of everything from the individual crystals of ice on a frost covered leaf to the tiny cells on a dragonfly's wings.’

He said that the tool enables photographers to leave the house with just their phone and a lens, and still be able to take SLR quality images.

‘ It can be remotely controlled using your smart-phone so you can get all kinds of weird and wonderful angles that you simply wouldn't think to try with a larger camera,’ Mr Buck added.

This is the set-up Mt Buck used to capture his icy images in Hampstead heath. You can see his smartphone with the QX1 lens-style camera clipped on (the black part) onto which a large macro lens is also attached, making his gear more than a little bit different from using a standard smartphone camera

A longhorn beetle, is shown left. The insect's furry antennae are longer than its body.  A common green birdwing butterfly is pictured up close on the right. It's found in New Guinea and northeast Australia and has distinctive green stripes and other markings on its velvety black wings

‘Although the cameras in smartphones are getting better all the time, there is a whole world of microscopic detail that you could never photograph with them until now due to the limited nature of their fixed lenses,' Mr Buck said. Here, an elephant hawkmoth is shown
