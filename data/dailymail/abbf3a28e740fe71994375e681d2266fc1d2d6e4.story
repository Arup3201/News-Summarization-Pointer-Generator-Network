Nike insist they remain in talks with Manchester United despite it emerging that the American sportswear company are not expected to renew a long-running kit supply deal with the club because of the cost of a new contract.

Nike has been supplying United’s famous red shirts since 2002 but the current agreement expires next year. Its withdrawal is expected to clear the way for the club to sign a lucrative new deal with German sportswear company Adidas.

Sportsmail revealed in May that Adidas were in pole position to take over from Nike and on Monday columnist Charles Sale told how Adidas executives remain confident they will replace Nike as Manchester United’s shirt suppliers.

‘Clearly Nike’s football business is booming and they could easily afford to do this (deal). They had the right to match any other offer but looking at the deal on the table, they will walk away as it doesn’t make commercial sense,’ a source told Reuters.

United received around £38million from the Nike deal in 2012-13, including its share of profit from the sale of merchandise around the world.

Media reports had suggested the club was looking for a new deal worth around £60m per season.Nike and Adidas are battling for supremacy in the football kit industry, with the American company having made big inroads into a sport that its German rival long dominated.

Off the peg: Manchester United have unveiled their new kit for the 2014-15 season

United 
have unveiled their new Nike kit for the 2014/15 season featuring England striker 
Wayne Rooney and Old Trafford 
team-mates Robin van Persie and Shinji Kagawa.

The
 collarless shirt, designed by Nike, features white on the sleeves and a
 hint of black, and marks the first strip released during Louis van 
Gaal's tenure of the Old Trafford club.

The
 traditional white collar returns for the new campaign, while the words 
'youth, courage and greatness' are embossed in the neck of the shirt.

Rooney and
Co will wear the shirt for the first time later this month when they 
take on LA Galaxy as part of their pre-season tour of America.

The
 home strip is the first to bear the Chevrolet logo and Old Trafford 
fans will be hoping that it brings the club better results than they 
experienced last term.
