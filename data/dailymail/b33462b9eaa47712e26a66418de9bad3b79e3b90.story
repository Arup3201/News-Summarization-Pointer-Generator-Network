A British photographer captured these stunningly detailed portraits – using only an iPhone.

Allie Astell, 42, from Bath, moved to Egypt in 2011, where she found she enjoyed taking photographs of her Bedouin neighbours.

The resulting pictures appear as if they were taken on a professional camera costing thousands of pounds, but in fact the technology used to produce them is found in most people's pockets.

Ms Astell said she first started using her mobile phone to snap photos because the Bedouin were wary of large lenses.

By using her iPhone she was able to be less intrusive and found it easier to get intimate portraits.

She said: 'I don't like carrying around a huge camera. I find it intimidates people and you can take a more natural photo with a phone than with a digital SLR camera. 

'It just fits in my handbag and it's easy to take photos quickly.

'The Bedouin are my favourite subjects for photos. You can't take pictures of the women because it's against their culture – but I find Bedouin men and children fascinating.'

Bedouin means 'inhabitant of the desert' and refers generally to the desert-dwelling nomadic tribes of Arabia and Egypt.

Ms Astell started taking photos on her phone in 2010, but only started taking photography seriously in 2012.

She said: 'I started taking photos with my iPhone 3G while on a holiday to Syria in 2010.

'I didn't start getting into the hobby seriously until I moved to Dahab with an iPhone 4. I downloaded the Hipstamatic app and I really got into it.

'Once I started taking shots I was hooked.

'A self-confessed iPhone addict, Hipstamatic, Instagram and Leme Cam are my favourite apps for photography.

'Now I've got an iPhone 5S. The camera is much better and I've 64GB of memory to play with.'

The latest version of Apple's phone, the iPhone 6, has sold more than 20 million units since it was launched and also comes with an eight megapixel camera.

Ms Astell was born in Morocco to a Syrian mother, Hayfa, and an English father, Geoff, and said she began travelling as a young child with her parents.

She said her decision to move to Egypt was inspired by a trip she took there with her family.

She now runs a web consultancy business, allowing her to work 'from anywhere that has an internet connection'. 

She said her job allows her to indulge in her two real passions – travel and photography.

Her most recent trips have been to the Middle East, including Syria and Morocco, and Norway and Las Vegas, where she photographed the World Beard and Moustache Championships.
