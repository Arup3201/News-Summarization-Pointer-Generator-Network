Sean Dyche has revealed that he tried to sign new England hero Harry Kane on loan for Burnley when he first took over at Turf Moor.

Burnley face Tottenham at home on Sunday and Dyche must try to find a way of stopping Kane whose career has rocketed since honing his skills out on loan at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester earlier in his career.

Dyche was also in the queue to sign Kane after taking over as Burnley manager in 2012, and he believes that the 21-year-old striker's spells in the Championship have helped make him the player he is today.

'He's a player that most people would have had a look at when he wasn't in the side at Tottenham,' said Dyche.

'It's a good reflection of how the loan system can work, and it doesn't have to be the glory loan – the one where it works every time. He's had his ups and downs on loan but that can be a massive part of a young player's development, experiencing the fact that it doesn't always work hand in glove.

'It's not always perfect, you don't play every week, you have to challenge yourself to keep going and keep grinding and be professional every day to be ready to play when you're called upon.

'He was out at Millwall and it was possibly a step too early when he went out to Norwich to play there, and then Leicester a few bits and bobs off the bench.

Kane enjoyed a phenomenal start to his international career by scoring on his debut last Friday

Kane headed home against Lithuania just 79 seconds after coming on to the field as a substitute 

'All of that for a young man who seems to me to have a very good temperament and a very good desire to be a footballer, (shows that) if you stick at it long enough you get your rewards. It has to be the ups and downs of football to bring the reality.'

FA chairman Greg Dyke tabled a series of new proposals last week aimed at increasing the number of homegrown players in the Premier League. Burnley are the only team in the top-flight to field an all-British team this season, and Dyche believes that the only way for players like Kane to truly progress is to be given a chance at the highest level.

Kane was sent on loan to several clubs in the lower leagues, including here at Millwall, before he found fame

'It's not an exact science,' he added. 'The way the FA are trying to take a grip of it is to try and crunch it down to a better chance of elite young players coming through the system, and an improved chance of them being future England players.

'I don't think there's a perfect situation but they are certainly searching hard to find the best situation of allowing those players real growth.

'But that is inevitably playing in the Premier League. The earlier they can get that experience to play at the top level is the best learning curve.'
