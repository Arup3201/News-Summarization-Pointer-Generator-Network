One day soon, six-year-old Molly Bent will become blind.

So before that time comes, she is determined to see as many wonderful places and special events as possible – and has drawn up a ‘bucket list’ of them. 

Molly was born with perfect sight but a year ago was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a disease that is ruining her vision.

Molly, six, is desperately trying to complete a special 'bucket list' of things she wants to see before a genetic condition makes her go blind

'Molly has a list as long as her arm of things she wants to see. She wants to visit London, Australia and Egypt to see the pyramids. I know I won't be able to give her half of that, but I can try,' said Mrs Bent

Her parents Chris, 27, a civil servant, and Eve, 26, are raising funds to  try to ­fulfil her wishes.

Speaking at their Manchester home, Mrs Bent said: ‘It is heartbreaking for us but Molly is so bright. She has a list as long as her arm of things she wants to see.

'I know I won’t be able to give her half of that but I can try.’

'We just want to help her create as many magical memories as we possibly can.

'As parents it is heartbreaking for us because Molly does get upset and asks a lot of questions, but she is so bright and she loves the world around her.

Molly proudly displays a trophy that she won. She has Retinitis Pigmentosa - a genetic condition that Mrs Bent's brother Chris also suffers from

Molly will eventually learn to read braille and have white stick training to help her cope when she loses her sight, but for now her parents are focusing on helping her make memories now

Retinitis pigmentosa is a rare hereditary condition affecting 10,000 people in Britain - it gradually destroys the retina, the light- sensitive layer at the back of the eye.

The condition causes permanent changes to vision but how quickly this happens and how it changes differs between people.

In most of the more common forms of retinitis pigmentosa, the first symptoms occur between childhood and the age of 30.

The first symptom you is people with the condition find it difficult to see in poor light, such as outdoors at dusk, or in a dimly lit room.

This is often referred to as 'night blindness'.

While most people find it takes their eyes about 20 minutes to adapt to dim light, a person with the condition will find it will either take much longer or it won't happen at all.

A second symptom is the loss of some o peripheral vision or peripheral visual field.

This means that when the person is looking straight ahead they become less able to see things either to the side, above or below.

Currently, there is no known cure or treatment for RP or associated retinal disorders.

In her early years Molly, who has younger sister Charlotte, five, and Samuel, two, could see perfectly.

But when she started school, her mother noticed she was struggling to see her homework and watch her favourite programmes on TV.

Opticians prescribed the little girl with glasses, but her parents watched as Molly’s sight continued to deteriorate.

After 18 months of tests Molly was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa - a genetic condition that Mrs Bent's brother Chris also suffers from.

Mrs Bent whose 27-year old husband is a civil servant added: 'Although my brother has the condition and several uncles have had it, I never thought Molly could have inherited it because we were always told that only boys could get it.

'When we got the diagnosis it was a big shock. We don’t know exactly when Molly will go blind but it feels as though her sight deteriorates every time we go to the opticians.

'She now can’t see out of the sides of her eyes and recently she told us that everybody standing far away looks like ‘fuzzy teddy bears.’

'Molly also has night blindness, so she can hardly see in low lights and she falls over quite a lot. She has ended up in hospital after falling over.

'Ever since we got the diagnosis we have been trying to raise funds to create special memories for Molly to have when she does lose her sight.

'We have taken her to the zoo, a butterfly house in Lancaster and to the Manchester Museum to see Egyptian mummies and the dinosaurs.'

As the condition is hereditary, Charlotte and Samuel are also being tested to see if they may be affected by Retinitis Pigmentosa.

Mrs Bent, who is a full time mother said: 'Charlotte and Samuel get tested every three to six months to check for signs. There is still a chance that I could have three blind children and that terrifies me.

'Charlotte is brilliant with Molly on our walks to and from school. She warns Molly when there is a wheelie bin, a stick or lamp post in her way. It makes me very proud.'

Molly will eventually learn to read braille and have white stick training to help her cope when she loses her sight, but for now her parents are focusing on helping her cherish the world around her.
