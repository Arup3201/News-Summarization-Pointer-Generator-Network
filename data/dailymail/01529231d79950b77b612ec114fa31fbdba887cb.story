Dozens of people have been forced to evacuate their homes as wildfires sweep across the Portuguese islands of Madeira.

Firefighters have been battling the flames, caused by scorching summer temperatures of up to 40C (104F), since Wednesday.

Efforts have also been hampered to contain the erupting flames because of high winds.

Saved from destruction: Blackened hillsides are seen in front of saved homes after a fire in Santa Cruz , some 20 km from Funchal, on Madeira Island. Fires raged around the towns of Calheta, Ribeira Brava and in Santa Cruz

Close-run thing: The lush countryside is burnt almost to the back doors of surrounding properties. Most homes were evacuated as a precaution, and homeowners at least have something to return to

Not everyone was lucky: A burnt car sits in a carbonised forest after a fire in Camacha. High temperatures and strong winds fanned the fires, which started two days ago

The latest evacuations took place on Porto Santo, a smaller island near the main island of Madeira.

Television footage showed houses ablaze and firemen telling villagers of Camacha to 
abandon the area.

Enveloped in heavy smoke, local 
residents desperately sprayed water on the outside of their homes while 
others ran to flee the flames.

There have been no reports of deaths or serious injuries.

'The changing wind is strongly 
compromising the effort to put out the flames, and we only have five 
firemen there and one truck,' fire brigade chief Afonso Nobrega told 
Portuguese media.

The Interior Ministry has sent a 
military transport plane with 83 firefighters to Madeira and Interior 
Minister Miguel Macedo flew to the archipelago to co-ordinate the efforts.

On Wednesday, flames several storeys high threatened the outskirts of the region's capital and popular tourist destination, Funchal.

Two homes were destroyed and at least 25 more damaged, according to officials.

A school was among the scores of apartments, hotels, homes and other buildings that had to be evacuated.

In mainland southern Portugal's Algarve region, more than 300 firefighters were struggling to put out wildfires near Tavira, a popular holiday destination near the Spanish border.

Authorities have now deployed planes and helicopters to combat the flames, including an aircraft sent by Spain's civil defence.

Cash-strapped Portugal, which 
received a bailout worth 78bn euros ($116bn or Â£70bn), from other 
European countries and the International Monetary Fund, has had 
relatively few forest fires in the past two years, as temperatures were 
low and rainfall high.

But the country has also suffered a 
drought since the beginning of the year and this, coupled with a 
scorching heatwave, poses a threat of more fires during the hottest 
months of July and August.

Smoke is seen from the window of an airplane landing at the airport of Funchal, Madeira.
