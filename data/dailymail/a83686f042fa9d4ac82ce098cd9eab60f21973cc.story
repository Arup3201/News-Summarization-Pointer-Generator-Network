A 19-year-old boy has died after falling into a coma following being hit with a Taser by police at a Baltimore hospital.

The city's police department has launched an investigation after the incident at Good Samaritan Hospital.

Officers claim that the teenager was part of a violent altercation with at least five security guards earlier this month when they got involved in the struggle.

The teenager, whose identity has not 
been revealed because he is a ward of state, was given an unknown 
amount of medication before officers arrived on the scene, according to reports.

Baltimore police Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez told CBS: 'The person was breathing when the officers left the hospital.

'It was not learned that the individual was in a coma and was possibly brain dead until several days after this incident.'

Police would not reveal if the teenager had been Tased more than once or for how long. 

He was initially brought to the hospital suffering from emotional distress on May 6.

He had been taken to the hospital from a home he was staying at. It is unclear whether the boy was at a foster or group home.

Officials who spoke to The Baltimore Sun would identify the teenager only as a 'ward of state'. It is unclear why he was a ward of state but in Maryland you can remain in state care until the age of 21.

A spokesman for Good Samaritan Hospital refused to comment on the case to MailOnline today because the name of patient could not be provided.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the Baltimore Police Department.

Once witnesses and the responding officers are interviewed for the investigation, the findings will be turned over to the State's Attorney's Office.
