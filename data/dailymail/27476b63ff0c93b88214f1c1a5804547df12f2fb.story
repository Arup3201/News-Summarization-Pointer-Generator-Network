Convicted rapist Ched Evans has spoken out saying he is 'ashamed' of his actions - but has expressed no remorse for the crime and continues to protest his innocence.

The footballer, who was released from prison on Friday after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a woman in a hotel room, has said that cheating on his girlfriend was 'unforgivable' and that he wishes he could 'turn back the clock'.

But the 25-year-old has maintained that the sex was consensual.

Convicted rapist Ched Evans has said he is 'ashamed' of his actions and wishes he could 'turn back the clock' on the May 2011 hotel room incident, but has continued to protest his innocence

Spokeswoman for Rape Crisis charity Katie Russell has said Evans' comments are harmful and insulting to his victim, for whom she said he had never shown any regard.

Evans, who was convicted of rape by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court two years ago, told the Sunday Mirror: 'It was something that should never have happened. And it is something that I will regret for the rest of my life. I cheated on my girlfriend and had sex with this girl - but it was definitely consensual.'   

Evans' mother, Helen Roberts said her son was 'buzzing' and will return home with 'all guns blazing to prove his innocence'. His family and girlfriend Natasha Massey - who has a led a campaign to have Evans conviction overturned - were to throw a coming home party for him. 

Ms Roberts said that her son's critics didn't know all the facts. She told the Daily Star: 'We just hope the feminist gang will soon find something else to go and bang their drum about.' 

Ms Massey has led a campaign to have Evans conviction overturned; his case is to be reviewed by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the coming weeks

Evans, who was jailed in April 2012 for the rape in Rhyl, North Wales, admitted having sex with the woman but she told the jury she had no memory of the incident.

The prosecution said the 19-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse.

An appeal against Evans' conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012 but it is due to be reviewed by the Criminal Case Review Commission in the coming weeks.

Cases normally take several months to be dealt with by the commission, but Evans' case is being fast tracked due to 'issues raised' by his legal team. 

The commission said that was not a reflection of the strength of his case. The request was in line with their 'policy on prioritisation' and 'the facts of the case'. 

Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald also admitted having sex with the victim but was found not guilty of the same charge. 

Debate has raged during the past week about whether the former Sheffield United player should be able to return to football.

Many Blades fans have called for Evans to be rehabilitated but almost 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to take him back.

TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy by claiming his crime was 'non violent' and did not cause 'bodily harm' during a panel discussion on ITV's Loose Women.

Her comments caused a wave of criticism, abuse on social media and led to threats being made against her daughter, fitness instructor Chloe. 

Yesterday Sheffield United said they had not offered Evans a new contract.

In a statement, the club dismissed the report as 'speculative' adding: 'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long-term decision about Ched Evans.'

TV presenter and Sheffield United patron Charlie Webster, who revealed in an interview earlier this year she was sexually assaulted as a teenager, said she will quit her role with the club if they re-sign Evans.

She told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'You will have young people cheering him on when he scores a goal. Not under my name, under my club or community.

'He says he is innocent, he has shown no remorse.'

She was immediately branded a 'hypocrite' by Evans' sister Kylie, who retweeted a message in which the sports presenter posted last month saying she wanted to get a photograph of former heavyweight boxing champion and convicted rapist Mike Tyson.

He was convicted of rape in 1992 after an incident the previous year and subsequently served three years of a six-year sentence.

Miss Webster, 31, later said she was now 'not proud of' her Tyson tweet. 

In May 2011, Evans had been out with his brother and a friend of his, along with McDonald. The group went to a bar and then had a kebab.

Evans said McDonald decided to go back to his hotel and hailed a cab, at which point the victim appeared and asked to go with him. 

Evans took a separate taxi with his brother and his brother's friend, but then received a text from McDonald saying he had 'got a girl'.

He then told his taxi driver to head for the hotel, where he had booked and paid for a room under McDonald's name. 

Evans said when he entered the room McDonald was having sex with the woman and he asked if he could join in. He claims the woman said yes.

When they had finished having sex, Evans said the woman rolled over, so he left.

The prosecution's case was that the woman was too drunk to consent to sex. She had no memory of events after 3am and told police she woke up 'confused and dazed'.
