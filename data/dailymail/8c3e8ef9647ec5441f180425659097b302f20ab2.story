Rafael Nadal showed glimpses of his best form and some rustiness as he beat Jarkko Nieminen 6-1, 6-4 on Thursday to advance to the Madrid Open quarter-finals.

The Spanish world number one is used to rolling over opponents on clay but this year he lost in the quarter-finals in Monte Carlo and Barcelona to dent his confidence ahead of his bid for a ninth French Open title.

The three-time champion started well and swept Nieminen aside in the first set with his powerful passing shots as Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo watched from the stands with his son.

Nadal led 3-0 in the second set before Finn Nieminen, the world number 57, broke back and had break points in Nadal's next service game which he failed to take.

Nadal struggled with his timing but scraped through and next faces sixth seed Tomas Berdych who beat Grigor Dimitrov 3-6, 6-3, 6-2.

'At 6-1 and 3-0 I was playing at my best level since Monte Carlo but then I slowed down a bit and made some errors,' said Nadal.

'I am working on finding my level and performance. Today I did what I had to do but I still need to be more consistent.'

Barcelona Open champion Kei Nishikori of Japan reached the quarter-finals after beating eighth seed Milos Raonic 7-6, 7-6, his eighth successive victory on clay.

In the women's draw, Serena Williams earned her 650th career victory with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Carla Suarez Navarro to progress to the last eight.

Williams, in pursuit of her 60th title, hit 27 winners to her Spanish opponent's five, while securing seven break points in the sun.

'She made me work for every point and it wasn't an easy win,' the top-ranked American said. 'She just won last week, so she is definitely not an easy player to play.'

Williams goes on to play 2011 champion Petra Kvitova after the fifth-seeded Czech beat countrywoman Lucie Safarova 6-4, 6-3.

Australian Open champion Li Na and third-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska also won in the third round.

After a poor opening set, the second-ranked Li overcame a slew of unforced errors and a bothersome toe problem to beat Sloane Stephens of the United States 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, while Radwanska won 6-1, 6-1 over Roberta Vinci of Italy.
