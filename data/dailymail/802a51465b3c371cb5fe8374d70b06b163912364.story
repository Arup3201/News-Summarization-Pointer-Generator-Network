Brazil will have to reach the World Cup final without their suspended captain Thiago Silva.

The defender, who scored the hosts’ opening goal against Colombia on Friday, was booked for blocking goalkeeper David Ospina’s clearance in the second half.

David Luiz added a second goal minutes later to effectively confirm Brazil’s place in the last four, where they will face Germany on Tuesday.

Colombia pulled a goal back through James Rodriguez’s penalty with 10 minutes remaining but Jose Pekerman’s side could not find an equaliser.

Silva’s booking came after Brazil midfielder Fernandinho had escaped a caution despite a plethora of fouls. He has made 10 in his last two games without being punished.

Colombia star Rodriguez was also booked, for the foul that led to Luiz’s stunning free-kick leveller.Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side will take on the Germans in Belo Horizonte next week with Bayern Munich’s Dante expected to replace Silva at the heart of the defence.
