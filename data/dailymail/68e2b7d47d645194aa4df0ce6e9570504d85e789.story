A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a teenager during a brutal sword and knife attack in an affluent suburb of London.

Hani Abou El Kheir, 16, died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico on Sunday evening in a suspected drugs-related attack.

Detectives, who believe at least 10 people were involved in the incident, this morning arrested a suspect during an early morning raid in north London.

Victim:  A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of Hani Abou El Kheir, left and right,  who was believed to have been attacked by a gang wielding swords and knives

Horrific: The 16-year-old died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico, one of London's most affluent neighbourhoods, last Sunday evening

The teenage victim, who lived on the nearby Churchill Gardens estate, was taken to King's College Hospital following the attack but died later.

Detectives said they were keeping an 'open mind' regarding a motive and were being assisted by a number of witnesses who have already come forward.

Details of the attack emerged today as the inquest into Hani's death was officially opened and adjourned.

'This 16-year-old male was chased and assaulted by a large number of 
masked and hooded youths, armed with weapons', coroners officer 
Martin Urquhart told Westminster 
Coroner's Court.

'He sustained serious injuries, and despite medical treatment at the 
scene and at Kings College Hospital, he died later that evening.'

Detective Chief Inspector Neil Attewell, of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said Hani suffered a 'horrific and sustained vicious attack'.

He added: 'The tragic events of last Sunday have left Hani's mother and wider family completely devastated.

Grieving: Family members including Hani's mother Pauline Hickey, pictured with her hood up, lay flowers next to the scene where he was stabbed

Tragic: Hani's mother can be seen laying flowers surrounded by other family members

'Hani's mother has lost her only child 
and is still coming to terms with the heartbreaking events that have led
 to the death of her son.

'I am directly appealing to the parents and carers of those believed to be involved - if you have slightest indication that your child may have been involved in this incident I encourage you to get them to hand themselves in to the police.

'Failing to do so will result in my officers pursuing them until we have caught all those responsible.'

A note from the victim's mother, Pauline Hickey, was left with flowers at the scene where he died.It read: 'My baby. My heart is broken. I love you so much, the pain is unbearable. Your loving mother.'

Another tribute attached to a nearby bus stop was a copy of a touching note written by Hani to his mother, alongside a picture of him as a child.

It said: 'Thank you for being the best mum. Love to mummy, thank you for everything. Love from Hani.'

The tribute was signed by relatives including the teenager's grandparents, and cousins in Ireland.

Coroner Jean Harkin officially opened and adjourned the inquest today. It
will resume at a later date once the police investigation has concluded.
