Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright is giving his Twitter fans the chance to play alongside him at Wembley in his last ever football match.

Wright won the FA Cup twice and the League Cup on the hallowed Wembley turf during his legendary Arsenal stint. 

He also suffered heartache at the Twin Towers as Crystal Palace lost the replay of the 1990 FA Cup final to give Sir Alex Ferguson his first Manchester United trophy.  

Having hit one million followers on Twitter the former England striker, who scored nine goals in 33 appearances for the Three Lions, decided to give something back to the fans.

Wright said: 'I've watched all the FA Cup Finals from 1970 up to the present day, and Wembley is such a special stadium. I never dreamed that I would actually get to play and score there.

'Because it all happened to me at Wembley, I wanted to have a game there and give my Twitter followers the chance to be a part of it.

'It's my last, ever game of football…I wanted to do something really special for the million. I thought to myself I would love to have one more game, I can't even remember the last time I played.

'It's going be special for me but I want it to be special for them. It's going to be something they remember for the rest of their lives. They've got the opportunity to play at Wembley simply because they follow me.

The opponents have yet to be revealed by Wright, who didn't sign professionally until he was almost 22, but his followers will be able to help select the team name, badge and kit in the build up to the game.
