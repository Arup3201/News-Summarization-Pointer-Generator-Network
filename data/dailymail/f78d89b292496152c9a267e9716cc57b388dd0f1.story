Lamp posts, bus stops, post boxes and other city centre landmarks could soon have something to say - thanks to a remarkable new initiative that has given them a BRAIN.

Inanimate objects across Bristol are set to be given individual mobile phone codes allowing them to interact with anyone who texts them.

The clever bit of kit - dubbed 'Hello Lampost' - is set to make the posts and pillars 'come alive' as they 'learn' from conversations and give intelligent answers, as well as spread rumours and spill secrets texted to them in confidence.

Pan Studio are using a £30,000 grant to bring Bristol's urban landscape to life with their scheme.

Company boss Ben Barker said: 'We have been developing the game mechanics and finessing conversation styles of the text messages.

'We hope it will inspire Bristolians to converse and play with their street furniture - and ultimately each other, as they'll get to discover more about other passers-by in their vicinity.

'The more people take part the more fun for all.'

Each object will be given a unique code, meaning that the more texts an object receives, the wider its variety of responses will be.

The internet of things is a vision that sees every single existing, tangible object on Earth connected to a tiny device, providing it with its own IP address.

Then all objects - animate and inanimate - communicate independently with each other. In a world equipped with the internet of things, items such as a medicine cabinet would be continuously aware of its contents.

It would be able to tell you which medicine was running out, and which was approaching its expiry date.

Clare Reddington, Executive Producer of the Playable City Award, is looking forward to how this experiment will allow people to enjoy the city streets.

She said: 'At the start of this year, the MIT Technology Review designated 2013 the year of the Internet of Things - a trend for physical objects to become more connected and interactive.

'We at Watershed wholeheartedly embrace 
with the Playable City Award, a chance for city dwellers to engage with 
the physical landscape around them in a fun and exploratory way.

'It's a complete experiment, and we 
can't wait to find out what we'll discover about our street furniture, 
our city, and in the process, ourselves.'

Hello
 Lamp Post will launch in Bristol on 15 July and run until 8 September, 
and will include bus stops, lampposts, postboxes and charity bins.

Each object will be given a unique code, meaning that the more texts an object receives the wider its variety of responses will be. The objects will be able to 'learn' from their interactions

The process of adding web connections to inanimate objects is called the Internet of Things. Previous objects that have 'come alive' include lamps, fridges and cars
