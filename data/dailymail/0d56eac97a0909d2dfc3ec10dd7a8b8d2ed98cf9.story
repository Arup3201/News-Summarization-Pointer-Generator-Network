Police have identified the mother of 'Baby Hope', a little girl whose body was found dumped in a cooler off a New York highway more than two decades ago.

NYPD cold case detectives had renewed their investigation this summer after highway workers in 1991 found the child, believed to be between 
three and five years old, tied with rope 
and squeezed into a picnic cooler beneath full cans of Coca-Cola, off the Henry Hudson Parkway.

New information was revealed today after authorities received a tip from a woman who believes she knows the sister of 'Baby Hope'.

Grisly discovery: The cooler containing Baby Hope was found in Washington Heights, on an embankment off the Henry Hudson Parkway

Police have conducted follow-up interviews and confirmed the mother's identity using scientific evidence, a source told the New York Times.

No names were being released as the case remains a murder investigation and no charges have been brought so far.

In
 July, around the 22nd anniversary of the unsolved case, police 
circulated the neighborhood around Dyckman Street in Washington Heights 
near the wooded area where the child was found, speaking to residents 
and offering a $12,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest 
and conviction.

The little girl had been malnourished and tests showed she had endured sexual abuse and she died of asphyxia.

She was naked except for a hair-tie with yellow plastic baubles on it. She had black hair and was white, possibly Hispanic.

The child was badly decomposed, making 
her facial features unrecognizable, and no one came forward to claim 
her. No one had filed a missing persons report and there were very few 
clues.

According to police sources on Monday, someone called the tip line in July claiming to have spoken to a woman whose sister had been killed.

Even for hardened New York City cops, the case was a sad and grisly one. Detectives named the girl 'Baby Hope', in the hope that someone would come forward and help them find out who she was and what happened to her.

Two years after her discovery, Baby Hope was buried in St Hamond's ceremony. The police of the 34th Precinct pooled their money and paid for her gravestone. She was buried in a white communion dress. 

Years passed, and still no one came forward. In 2007, Baby Hope's body was exhumed to try and extract a DNA sample, but her bones were in such bad condition it was impossible.

A second attempt in 2011, using improved technology yielded a complete DNA profile, and police immediately ran a check on all their convicted felon and missing persons databases but came up empty-handed. 

Changing neighborhood: Washington Heights has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan, but in the '80s and early '90s, when Baby Hope was killed, the area was deeply affected by a crack cocaine epidemic and gang activity

'It's hard for me to believe that nobody knows who she is,' Detective Joseph Neenan told The New York Times in 1991.

The officer in charge of the case, he was accustomed to searching for missing persons.

'We have the opposite,' he said. 'We have her. We don't know who she is.'

Now, 22 years later, Detective Robert Dewhurst echoes him:

'I feel somebody knows who this girl was,' he told the New York Daily News.

Perhaps Baby Hope 'had little girlfriends that are grown now and know something wasn’t right on the block when she was gone'.

'Everything about this case is already out there,' Sergeant Carlos Nieves, a police spokesman, told The New York Times. “They’re hoping that somebody who hasn’t come out sees this.'

At the time of Baby Hope's death in 1991, Washington Heights was in the thrall of a crack cocaine epidemic and the area was known for gangs and violence.

Now, it has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan and families with young children walk the streets with impunity.

There are a lot of new faces, but police are optimistic that some of the older members of the community remember the case of Baby Hope.
