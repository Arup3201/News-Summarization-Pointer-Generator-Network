There are rare times in football when goalkeepers pull off seemingly impossible saves – and Watford had to rely on one of those from Jonathan Bond to knock Stevenage out of the Capital One Cup.

Think Gordon Banks' save from Pele's header in the 1970 World Cup finals, Peter Schmeichel clawing out Steve Sedgley's header when Manchester United played Tottenham in 1994 or David Seaman defying physics to keep out Paul Peschisolido's header that was behind him in Arsenal's 2003 FA Cup semi-final versus Sheffield United.

Stevenage were only trailing 1-0 and deserved an equaliser but were left stunned when Watford's Bond leapt across goal to keep out and effort from Darius Charles at point-blank range in the 65th minute. The ball struck his body and somehow went over.

At that moment they were ahead by one ruthless move. It had taken until the 52nd minute for the Championship side to take the lead against their League Two opponents. Fernando Foriestieri picked up the ball in the right channel and played a deftly-weighted through ball to Diego Fabbrini. The Italian dropped his shoulder to move one-on-one with goalkeeper Sam Beasant then selflessly passed to Lloyd Dyer to finish. It was his first goal for the club since moving from Leicester this summer.

The gulf in the two sides was evident when the team-sheets were handed out. Watford manager Giuseppe Sannino was able to make nine changes from the side who beat Bolton 3-0 in their first game of the Championship season on Saturday, whereas Stevenage's Graham Westley could not even fill the allotted seven substitutes and named only five on his bench due to a raft of injuries.

But until that punishing breakaway goal the difference in quality was not so clear cut and it was Stevenage, relegated from League One last season, who almost took a shock lead in the 13th minute. Striker Charles held up the ball on the right and laid off to Charlie Lee, whose effort across goal beat Bond but crashed back off the left post. It took several seconds to stop shaking.

Watford's largely second string were inches away from going in front six minutes later. Lloyd Doyley played a long ball into the box and Beasant failed to spot Dyer's run, following the path of the ball instead. When Dyer stretched out a leg to reach the ball it looked to be rolling towards an empty net, only to trickle agonisingly the wrong side of the right post.

In the end, however, it was Bond's save that will be remembered from this tie.
