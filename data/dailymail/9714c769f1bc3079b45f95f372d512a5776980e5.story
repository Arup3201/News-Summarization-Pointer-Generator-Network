As people across Britain took precautions against another onslaught of heavy rain, one father decided the conditions were suitable for taking his toddler out for a seaside stroll.

Giant waves swept up by gales were battering the seafront in Sunderland when the unnamed man yesterday took his young child out in a pushchair for the hazardous walk.

There will be more showers today, mainly along western coasts and in southern England, with isolated showers in central and eastern parts of the UK.

But many parts of Britain will see sunny spells after two days of flooding, which has killed at least one person.

The weather will remain unsettled throughout the week, with rain in the South West tomorrow, spreading to north-east England. After a largely fine and dry Friday, it will turn wet, windy and cloudy again over the weekend.

A 64-year-old angler fishing off the breakwater at the mouth 
of the River Tees in Redcar, North Yorkshire, died after he was swept 
out to sea on Monday afternoon.

The man, along with a 63-year-old, was 
swept off a breakwater at South Gare by a powerful wave at around 
3.40pm.

The 63-year-old managed to make it ashore, but the other man 
died after he was picked out of 10ft waves by an RNLI lifeboat. Both men were from York.

A 13-year-old girl who went missing 
in poor weather while walking her dog on the coast at St Agnes in 
Cornwall on Monday night was later found suffering from a head injury by an 
80-strong team of rescuers.

East Ireland was also hit by severe flooding that has left two people dead. The body of a woman has been discovered 
in a flooded basement in Dublin while another body believed to be that 
of a missing police officer swept away last night has also been found.

In
 the Republic of Ireland, which has also been hit by heavy rain, two bodies have been found.

Police said they were called by worried neighbours to a Dublin house at about 11pm on Monday night.

A commuter makes his way to work through Dublin's flooded streets this morning. Two people have been killed as a result of torrential flooding in East Ireland

A preliminary search of the basement by the Garda Water Unit at 1am ended without finding anyone.

But after the basement was pumped out yesterday morning, the body of a woman was discovered. She is thought to be of Filipino origin and in her 30s.

Separately, rescue workers have 
recovered a body from the River Liffey in Co Wicklow, close to where 
Garda Ciaran Jones went missing on Monday.

The 25-year-old garda, who was 
stationed at Stepaside, south Dublin, had been helping people on the 
upper stretches of the river with his brother and a friend.

The officer was attempting to keep 
people safe from dangerous floods at Ballysmuttan bridge at 7pm 
yesterday when he was swept away.

The Garda press office confirmed that
 a body had been discovered at Ballyward Bridge in Manor Kilbride 
shortly after 9am but it has yet to be formally identified.

Water world: A train in Dublin lies surrounded by flood water late on Monday

Dublin was put on an emergency 
footing last night after torrential rain triggered flooding in the Irish
 capital suspending rail services, closing roads and leaving shops and 
homes under water.

More than one month's rain fell
 in 24 hours and parts of the city were engulfed by floodwaters, 
forcing commuters to wade home.

Dublin City Council activated its 
major emergency plan and sent teams out to evacuate badly hit houses and
 help clear the flood waters.

A number of ferries to and from Dublin were cancelled and flights were diverted from landing at the city's airport.

Bill Payne, a spokesman for 
forecaster MeteoGroup said 58mm of rain fell in Cardinham, near Bodmin in Cornwall, between 
7am and 7pm on Monday.

Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire received 50mm of 
rain in the same period.

One 'crazy' mother and her teenage 
son were rescued in the nick of time yesterday after they were blown out to sea
 on an inflatable rubber ring.

The unnamed woman and her son, 15, 
braved the cold to go for a dip and took two rubber rings into the waves
 off Towyn near Rhyl, North Wales.

But one ring was blown away and the pair were sharing the other when they began to drift offshore.

They were seen in difficulties by a passer-by who called the emergency services.

Mother and son were rescued by inshore lifeboat and taken to hospital suffering from hypothermia.

Temperatures which yesterday reached 19C (66F) will reach a high of around 16C (61F) in East Anglia and the South-East.

A
 flood warning in place for Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire has been lifted
 by the Environment Agency, but two remain in place for Scarborough, and
 Bridlington.

In Cornwall, the council's highways 
and environment services department received more than 300 calls about 
incidents caused by the severe weather over a period of a few hours 
yesterday. These include fallen trees, blocked drains and surface water 
flooding.

Torbay Council closed its seafront to traffic in the afternoon because of fears over flooding caused by the high tide.

An Environment Agency spokesman said 
yesterday: 'There have been some reports of flooding to property and 
continued disruption to travel is possible.

'Given the potential for very heavy 
localised downpours, small, fast responding rivers and streams are 
particularly prone to flooding, especially in Cornwall and West Devon.

'Strong winds and high tides in South
 Devon are also increasing the risk of localised flooding in coastal 
areas. Some precautionary closures of roads have been organised by local
 authorities.'
