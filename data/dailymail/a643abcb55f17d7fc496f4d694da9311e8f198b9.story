Peter Schmeichel says Manchester United’s failure to pick a settled back four will cost them in the long-run this season.

Marcos Rojo partnered Chris Smalling in the middle of the United defence for the 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday and it was their eighth different pairing in nine games.

Schmeichel played in the successful Manchester United sides of the 1990s and with centre back pairings of Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister and then later Jaap Stam and Ronny Johnsen.

Peter Schmeichel was on Match of the Day 2 and was critical of United's defence 

The former United No 1 was full of praise for goalkeeper David de Gea but says he needs stability infront of him.

Speaking to the BBC as part of his Match of the Day 2 analysis, Schmeichel said: ‘On Sunday, De Gea played exceptionally well and was trying to bring some sort of stability to their defence with the way he controlled his six-yard box and came for crosses.

‘But, whoever is in Van Gaal's defence, he does not seem to have enough commanding players who can stand on their own two feet.

‘He needs a centre-half who can take the team by the scruff of the neck and say "this is what we need to do". That player is not in their squad yet.

‘In my time at United, we always had defenders who were leaders and who took responsibility. For various reasons, that is not the case at the moment.’

Schmeichel was full of praise for David de Gea and his performances this season

Schmeichel played at the back with the likes of Jaap Stam during his career at Old Trafford 

United have conceded 13 goals in their nine league games so far, and Schmeichel believes De Gea’s form is the only positive Van Gaal can take from his side’s defending this season.

He added: ‘He has made some stunning saves against Sunderland and Everton, as well as against Chelsea to deny Hazard moments before Didier Drogba put them ahead.’
