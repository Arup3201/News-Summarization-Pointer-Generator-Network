Everybody loves a good cuddle, and one woman is capitalising on people's need for regular hugs as the UK's first professional snuggler.

Kitty Mansfield, from Ramsgate, Kent, opens her arms to people who 'crave intimacy' and want to cuddle up on the sofa, or even in her bed, and is earning up to £360 a day doing it.

The 45-year-old is happy to get cosy in front of a film or while listening to music depending on what her customers want.

They can even stay the weekend as part of her B&B weekend deal, and get into bed with two women for a 'stereo snuggle' with Kitty and her second snuggler, Natalya.

'It's a theraputic service for people who want to be snuggled,' Kitty said.

'People can just come and talk, or they can snuggle wherever they want for as long as they want.

'People want to feel a connection. It's something we have lost out on, touching has become a taboo.'

Dressed in her pyjamas and slippers, Kitty charges £45 an hour for her 'Be Snuggled' business just by wrapping her arms around her clients at her seaside home.

She even invites her clients to bring along their favourite pillow, blanket or teddy bear.

Kitty said: 'From the moment we're born we want to be held, it's just natural.

'I think certain people are better at snuggling than others, but as I like to be close to people, I think I do have a skill.'

Don't cross the line: Kitty draws a line at full intimacy and cuddlers have to wear underwear at all times

The service, which is the first of it's kind in the UK and just one of two in the world, is completely non-sexual.

Kitty's rules clearly state that 'any innapropriate requests or behaviour will result in your immediate exit' and areas normally covered by underwear are off-limits.

She insists that underwear must be worn at all times, and shorts and tank tops are prohibited - clients should wear pyjamas or a t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms.

Kitty launched the business after working as a holistic therapist for ten years, using the power of touch to soothe and heal.

But while her holistic massage has helped her clients deal with their aches and pains, she always felt that a part of the jigsaw was still missing.

After heavily researching the benefits of 'snuggling', she opened Be Snuggled.

She said: 'People love to be cuddled because it feels good and offers simple contact.

'However, not everyone has a suitable cuddling partner, somewhere out there someone is in serious need of human contact, yet he or she has no-one to turn to.

'At Be Snuggled, you will discover a safe, warm and non-judgemental oasis where you can step out of your everyday life, rediscover the pleasure of non-sexual snuggling and enjoy the many psychological and physiological benefits of cuddling.'

Kitty has also written a 'Cuddle Sutra' for her clients, which is filled with detailed descriptions and illustrations, before deciding exactly how they'd like to be snuggled.

Kitty's research has taught her there is a lot more to being snuggled than merely getting close to someone.

'One proven health benefit of cuddling is the release of oxytocin,' she said.

'Known as the feel-good hormone, oxytocin creates a sense of well-being and happiness.

'In addition, physical contact with others can lower blood pressure and reduce stress.'

But Kitty, who is separated, is aware that many will fail to understand the basics behind her Be Snuggled service.

She said: 'People think it's weird for people to just want to be cuddled if it's not sexual.

'People have become so standoffish and political correctness has taken over.

'I think I will get some criticism because it's not a standard type of service I'm offering.

'But the way I see it, hostility is just a symptom of fear.'
