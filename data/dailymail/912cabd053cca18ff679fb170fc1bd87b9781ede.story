Britain is only days away from  getting rid of Abu Hamza after the hook-handed cleric lost his final appeal against extradition.

The ruling by the European Court of Human Rights brings an end to a legal saga which has lasted eight years and cost the taxpayer more than £1million.

Delighted Home Secretary Theresa May wants Hamza – viewed as one of the world’s most dangerous preachers of hate – to now be put on a plane to America ‘as soon as possible’.

Kicked out: The ruling brings an end to a legal saga over Abu Hamza which has lasted eight years and cost more than $1.5million

In previous cases, suspects have been booted out within two weeks of losing their last appeal.

Hamza, who earned global notoriety 
for his fanatical sermons outside the Finsbury Park mosque in North 
London, is wanted by the US authorities for plotting to set up a jihadi 
training camp in the state of Oregon.

He and four other alleged terrorists 
had complained that jail terms of up to 50 years in the US without 
parole breached their right to be protected from ‘inhuman or degrading 
treatment’.

In April, the European Court of Human 
Rights – after two years of hugely expensive deliberation – rejected 
this argument. But the men were allowed to make a final plea for the 
grand chamber of the Strasbourg court to re-open the case. Last night, 
judges also threw this out. There are now no more legal steps they can 
take in Europe to halt extradition.

They can expect to be placed in immediate custody as soon as they set foot on American soil.

The verdict is a relief to the 
Government, which had feared that the judges would block extradition 
altogether, forcing it to release Hamza back on to the streets.

Hamza is also accused by the US of conspiring to take Western hostages in the Yemen and funding terrorism.

Also facing extradition are Babar 
Ahmad and Talha Ahsan, who are accused of conspiracy to commit terrorist
 atrocities overseas and supporting terrorist groups, and Khalid 
al-Fawwaz, who is considered one of the US’s most wanted terrorists 
suspects.

Al-Fawwaz, allegedly a close 
associate of Osama bin Laden, was arrested in connection with bomb 
attacks on two US embassies in east Africa which killed more than 260 
people in 1998.

The fifth man who can be removed, 
Adel Abdul Bary, is also wanted in connection with the embassy bombings 
and has been in prison for 13 years.

The total bill for extraditing the men is estimated to be more than £4million.

Hamza was first arrested at the 
request of the US in May 2004 but the extradition was halted when the UK
 decided to charge him on allegations relating to his sermons.

In 2006, he was jailed for seven years
 for preaching hate and inciting murder at Finsbury Park Mosque. The 
extradition proceedings resumed once Hamza became eligible for release.

He arrived in Britain more than 30 
years ago and has seven children from a second marriage. In the late 
1980s, he headed to Afghanistan but returned a few years later having 
lost an eye and both hands – allegedly blown off by a mine.

Last night, a Home Office spokesman 
said: ‘The Home Secretary welcomes today’s decision. We will work to 
ensure that the individuals are handed over to the US authorities as 
quickly as possible.’
