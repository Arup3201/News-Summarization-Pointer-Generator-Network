Groningen attacking midfielder Albert Rusnak is being earmarked for a return to the Premier League this summer - despite only leaving Manchester City last month.

A clutch of top-flight sides, including West Ham and Swansea, are monitoring the Slovakia Under 21 international after earning rave reviews in Holland this season.

Italian side Palermo are also keeping close tabs on the creative midfielder.

Albert Rusnak is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs 

Rusnak joined Groningen in January after being released by Manchester City

Rusnak has developed a reputation of scoring spectacular goals during his time in the Eredivise this season, and his strikes have not gone unnoticed.

The 20-year-old spent the first half of the season on loan at Dutch side SC Cambuur, where he scored four goals in 17 starts for the club.

His displays at SC Cambuur alerted Groningen, who moved for Rusnak on a permanent move after the forward was allowed to leave City on a free transfer.

And the ex-City man has continued his penchant for spectacular goals at his new club, scoring two in six games.

The attacking midfielder took the decision to leave City last year in search of first-team football.

Rusnak was highly-rated by City coaches following his arrival from FC Kosice as a teenage prodigy.

But the club's big spending era ultimately meant the talented Slovakian could not break into the senior set-up.

And the youngster could now be set to line-up against City as early as next season as English sides weigh up a summer swoop.
