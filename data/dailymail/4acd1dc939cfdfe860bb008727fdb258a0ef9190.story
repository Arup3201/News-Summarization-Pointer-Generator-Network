Finally home: Moslemuddin Sarkar has made it back to his home village in Bangladesh after 23 years

A man who was given up for dead has returned to his home village in Bangladesh after 23 years - the last 15 of which were spent in Pakistani prison.

Family members who long believed they would never see him again were stunned when Moslemuddin Sarkar returned home for the first time since 1989.

Sarkar was helped home by the International Committee of the Red Cross after he was imprisoned in Pakistan for 15 years.

Hundreds of well-wishers lined the streets of
Bishnurampur village, in Bangladesh's northern Mymensingh district, to catch a glimpse
of him and congratulate his tearful and jubilant family.

In a telephone interview, Sarkar said he had 
entered India without valid documents in 1989 without informing his 
family.

He was then caught as he tried to cross into Pakistan in 1997 
where he was jailed for trying to enter the country illegally.

Speaking in a combination of Urdu and Bangali, he added: 'I went to Pakistan believing that I 
would get a better job there. But they caught me at the border. I was 
beaten and tortured in prison.

'I wrote dozens of letters to my 
village address, but did not have any clue that they were never posted. 
At one stage I lost all hope of returning home.'

He added that he
was 'delighted' to see that his mother is still alive.

He added that he

The Red Cross became involved and 
facilitated Sarkar's return after his family received a tip-off that he 
was locked up in Pakistan and turned to the organisation for help, 
according to spokesperson Onchita Shadman, who described him as 'frail 
and overwhelmed'.

Julhas Uddin, Sarkar's younger brother, said most of the family had feared the worst.

The man was helped by the Red Cross who discovered he had been held at a Pakistani prison, like the one in this picture

'We searched for him for years and 
finally gave up hope believing he might have drowned in the sea. But our
mother always believed that her son would return home one day,' he told
AFP.

'My mother passed out as he hugged her
after returning. It was a heartbreaking scene. He could not control his
tears for hours,' he said.
