It claims to be searching for ‘the next singing superstar’.

But as viewers tuned in to watch The X Factor on Saturday, many were left thinking the programme was more interested in advertising.

Just 15 minutes 22 seconds were devoted to singing, during the 1 hour 25 minute programme.

'Advert Factor': Just 15 minutes 22 seconds were devoted to singing, during the 1 hour 25 minute programme while adverts were given a larger chunk of the total time, taking up 21 minutes 35 seconds

Adverts were given a larger chunk of the total time, taking up 21 minutes 35 seconds, while the programme began five minutes behind schedule due to a lengthy string of commercials.

The remaining 48 minutes was made up of chatter between judges, video clips of contestants and host Dermot O’Leary offering support backstage.

And it amounted to a small amount of actual singing being screened during what is ITV’s flagship entertainment show.

Among the commercials were several L’Oreal adverts, featuring judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, 31, and after the programme had ended there was a Costa Bingo one featuring Mel B, 39.

Taking to Twitter, one viewer wrote: ‘The X factor has more TV adverts than actual auditions what a joke,’ while another noted: ‘The worst thing about X factor is the 6,000,000 Advert breaks.’

‘Look forward to seeing the next 3 auditions within the next 45 minutes... # xfactor,’ one quipped sarcastically.

Some suggested the programme be renamed ‘The Advert Factor’.

And others admitted deliberately missing the programme when it was broadcast at 8pm, so they could watch it on catch up later on and fast forward through the adverts.

‘Watching X factor on catch up, adverts destroy the programme,’ one wrote, while another posted: ‘Note to self: X factor must only ever be watched on catch up! [Fast forward through] adverts, judges, all the chit chat c*** and BOOM a tidy 30min show.’

However, while catch up services on televisions allow viewers to skip past advertisements, anyone trying to watch the first episode of series 11 on ITV Player would have been forced to watch the commercials.

Online, the programme was divided into five sections, with viewers unable to move from one to the next without sitting through three or four adverts.

The lack of viewer support will come as a blow for ITV bosses, who had hoped to win over fans with the latest instalment of The X Factor

The lack of viewer support will come as a blow for ITV bosses, who had hoped to win over fans with the latest instalment of The X Factor.

Next week the programme will go head to head with Strictly Come Dancing, when the celebrity dance contest begins on BBC1.

On Twitter viewers discussed which one they would choose to watch, with one writing: ‘Watch Strictly, record X factor, then you can fast forward all of the adverts.’

It is not the first time ITV has been hit with accusations of too many commercial breaks in its programmes.

The X Factor, Britain’s Got Talent, and period drama Downton Abbey have all faced similar claims in the past.

Earlier this year viewers complained that Britain’s Got Talent, which is Simon Cowell’s other talent show, was cutting to an advert break after almost every performance.

Last night a spokesman for the programme said: ‘The number of minutes of advertising shown in The X Factor was no more than is usual in a programme of its length and was fully compliant with allowances stipulated in the Ofcom Code on the Scheduling of TV Advertising.’
