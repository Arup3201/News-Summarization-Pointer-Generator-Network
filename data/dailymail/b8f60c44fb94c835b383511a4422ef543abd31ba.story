Heroin addicts should be handed free tin foil, to encourage them to smoke rather than inject the drug, the Government’s drug tsar said.

Prof Les Iversen, chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, said inhaling heroin was safer than injecting it - because it removes the risk of catching dangerous diseases from needle sharing.

Drug addicts can already access free needles and syringes from the NHS, and Prof Iversen said tin foil should be added to the list of approved paraphernalia.

He said: ‘We recommended that aluminium foil should be part of legal paraphernalia.

'Heroin addicts and other injecting drug addicts can already obtain needles, sterile water and alcohol wipes etc legally so we’ve suggested that foil should be added to that list.

‘Foil can be used as a way of smoking heroin instead of injecting it and is thus considered safer, avoiding the hazards of injecting with possibly contaminated needles.

‘We’ve been subjected to a number of questions from the Department of Health about the safety of smoking versus injecting, and we are still waiting a response.

'We’ve been promised one by the end of the month.’

The Home Office insisted heroin is 'extremely harmful' but ministers will consider the advice.

Figures last month showed heroin usage had stabilised at 0.1 per cent of the population in 2010-11.

But the number of people using methadone, which is prescribed by doctors as an alternative to heroin, has gone up from 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent over the last two years.

Prof Iverson said the provision of foil to heroin users would reduce the risk of infection, cutting costs for the NHS.

He added: ‘I think it’s a good idea because it avoids the harms associated with injecting drug use, both infection at the site of injection and also the danger of transmitting viral and bacterial disease.

‘That can certainly lead to a large charge for the National Health Service and if we can find a safer way I think we should use it.’

A Home Office spokesman said:  'Heroin and crack cocaine are extremely harmful and cause misery to communities across the country.

'The government is considering the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and will respond in due course.'
