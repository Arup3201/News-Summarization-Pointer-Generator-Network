A mother-of-nine earning £38,000 a year in benefits who is pregnant again with twins today revealed she plans to be sterilised.

Cheryl Prudham, 32, and her husband Rob, 29, are set to earn another £1,400 a year when the twin baby girls are born - and that will see their handouts rise to a staggering £40,000.

But part-time carer Mrs Prudham, of Gravesend, Kent, has insisted she will not be made to feel guilty for having more children - and plans to get a sterilisation, so she can focus on her career.

Family time: Cheryl, 32, and Rob Prudham, 29, at their previous home with their children George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, Madison, five, Leon, three, Lenny, two, and Lainey, one

She said: ‘For one, I work more hours than what they are saying and two, I'm going to be sterilised. I'm going to have a caesarean and I'm going to get sterilised at the same time.

‘I'm glad that I am pregnant with twins and I am amazed by it. It’s not anybody else's business. I do a job that most people couldn't do. I care for the elderly every single day.’

Mrs Prudham added: ‘I don't give a s*** if people are on my side or not. I don't care.

‘It is actually no one else's business about what I choose to do in life. It doesn't matter what you say people are still going to judge you. They are still going to bad mouth you.

‘I don't care what people think, it is my choice that 11 children are going to be more than enough. Obviously I want to carry on my career and things like that.’

Income: Mrs Prudham, 32, and her husband are set to earn another £1,400-a-year when the twin baby girls are born. And that will see their handouts raise to a staggering £40,000

The parents, who used to live in a tiny home in Sittingbourne, Kent, first demanded a home last year after hearing about other families on benefits who had landed huge properties.

They repeatedly bid for new council homes through Kent Homechoice, which works alongside Kent County Council. However, they were left furious when they were turned down by the authority.

Instead they agreed a house swap with a family living in Gravesend, Kent who wanted to downsize.

But Mrs Prudham told last week that she is unhappy with the new £200,000 home - because they do not like the new neighbourhood.

She added: ‘We've been here for about three months but I'm not really happy with the new house. We've got enough room but it's just we had to move out of Sittingbourne and we liked it there.

‘But there was nothing available there so I had to do a mutual exchange here and I don't really like it here to be honest. I'm not going to be able to go back to Sittingbourne.’

Mrs Prudham had her first son George, 14, when she was still just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000.

Cheryl and Rob Prudham split the day by working 20-hours a week each which brings in a total of just under £1,400 a month.

Their wages are topped up with £70 a week in working tax credits while their £123-a-week rent is paid for by the council.

The pair also receive £7,326 a year in child benefit and £400 a week in child tax credits.

It means the pair's annual income is £52,722 - £38,000 of which is benefits - which is £18,000 more than the average working UK household.

Now they are due to receive £1,400 a year more in child tax credits for the birth of twins.

She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 13, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, nine.

But the mother then had three unplanned pregnancies - Maisie, eight, Millie, six, and Madison, five. In March 2009 she met her current husband, and they had Leon, three.

They then had Lenny, two, before having daughter Lainey in January last year. Both parents work with as part-time carers and said working 20 hours a week entitled them to a new home.

Speaking last year, Mrs Prudham said: ‘I see other people in the paper and it makes me sick. They shouldn't just get a new home handed to them on a plate. It gives people with big families a bad name.

‘I don't want people to judge us because we have so many children. If I sat on my a*** I would understand people would have something to say. We would probably earn more on benefits.’

The mother also revealed she and her husband did not like using contraception - and she had a number of her children by mistake.

Mrs Prudham added: ‘In the past I have been on contraception but I got pregnant with the coil and the pill just doesn't settle well with me.

'We don't use condoms and me and Rob have never talked about it. I did rely on benefits before but I am motivated to be more than a mother.’

The pregnancy comes six months after the couple said on Facebook that they were going on a two-week holiday paid for by the taxpayer this summer.
