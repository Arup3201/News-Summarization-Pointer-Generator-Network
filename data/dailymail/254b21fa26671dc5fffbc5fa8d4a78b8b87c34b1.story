Some days you can spend hours driving around the tight corners of Paris looking for a parking space.

But this took a whole new meaning, when he was forced into an incredibly tight spot when his search for a space went terribly wrong, leading him to drive into a Metro station.

The driver was found pitched down the stairs to the entrance of the Champs Elysées Metro station, one of the busiest in the city.

Eventually a truck was called in to tow the car out, which drew a massive crowd, presumably much to the driver's embarrassment

The driver was focused on parking his car he failed to notice he was pulling into the station entrance and not a space.

French media reports didn't say if anyone was injured, or if alcohol was the cause of the incident, but it seemed the driver only realised his mistake after driving down quite a few stairs.

Twitter user Sofiane posted a picture, with the description: 'A bloke who confused an entry to the underground car park with the entrance of the Metro.'

The driver is thought to have been searching for a space on the incredibly busy street, and driven into the station thinking it was one of Paris' many underground car parks

The Metro has over 300 stations in Paris, and hundreds of thousands of drivers, and this could be why this particular parking gaffe wasn't the first to have happened in the City of Light.

In 2012, a driver identified only as Johan, 26 at the time, drove his 4x4 SUV partly into the entrance of the Chausee D’Antin Metro, shortly before realising it was not a station entrance.

At the time the driver said he was completely sober, and also claimed he had simply taken a wrong turn.

He said: 'There was a sign indicating parking for the Haussmann shops just
 in front of me, and there was no kerb next to the entrance of the 
steps, so that's how I made the mistake.

'By chance there wasn't anyone on the steps.'

'It was one of the strangest things I've seen in along time,' said an eye-witness who was sitting in a nearby cafe at the time.

Bizarre: In 2012 a confused tourist tried to drive his car down into a Paris Metro station after mistaking it for a car park

Weird: Eyewitnesses said it was one of the strangest things they had ever seen

Blunder: Fortunately the Frenchman managed to brake hard as soon as he realised what was happening

Lucky: Paris traffic police said the driver would not be prosecuted as he did not put anyone in danger and there was no damage to the Metro or the public road
