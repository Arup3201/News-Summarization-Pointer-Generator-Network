Ruud Gullit believes Wayne Rooney was one of the players at Manchester United who 'seriously failed' last season.

The former Premier League champions slumped to seventh in a disappointing campaign under David Moyes, and later Ryan Giggs.

And former Chelsea and Newcastle boss Gullit believes Rooney and new boss Louis van Gaal will have an interesting conversation after the striker's performances.

Experience doesn't matter: Wayne Rooney will have to prove his worth at Manchester United under Van Gaal

'I will be interested to see how things go between Van Gaal and Rooney,' Gullit said in The Sun on Sunday. 'Rooney is one of the senior players who seriously failed this season, so how will that conversation go?'

The England forward scored 17 goals last season, but it is thought Dutchman Robin van Persie may be given the captaincy by his current national team coach.

Gullit claimed in March that Van Gaal's move to take over at Tottenham was a 'done deal', but accepts that the 61-year-old is the perfect man for United.

'Van Gaal is the right man for the situation United find themselves in.

'He has the good fortune that some members of the old guard have left.'
