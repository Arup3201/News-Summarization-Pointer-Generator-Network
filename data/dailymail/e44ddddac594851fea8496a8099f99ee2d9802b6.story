A 103-year-old woman has been hailed as the world’s longest serving girl guide at a special party to celebrate her service to the group.

Dorothy Procter, who now serves with the Trefoil Guides, has been named as one of the world’s oldest girl guides after joining the group in the 1920s.

Dorothy was born in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1910 and joined the girl guides at the age of 14 before travelling across the globe and making a career as a police shorthand typist.

Former typist Dorothy, who took her advanced driving test aged 89, has now had to give up driving due to failing eyesight, but keeps up her duties with the guides.

She now passes her spare time playing scrabble and going to see live classical music as well as attending monthly meetings with the Guides.

Dorothy, of Heswall, Wirral said: 'The Guides is more of a way of life than an activity for me. I’d never turn my back on them, it’s a wonderful service for young girls.

'Once a Guide, always a Guide. It’s a funny story how I got involved with them. My friend knew a lot about flags and one day she said that the Town Hall’s flag was the wrong way around.

'When I asked her how she knew she said "if you were in the Guides you would know" and that’s when I joined.

'Even though I am getting on a bit, I attend the meetings every month.

'It’s very important to me and we get a bite to eat and have a sing along, which is always nice.'

Dorothy attributes her longevity to keeping fit by walking and cycling, she also believes that people must be mentally strong.

She said: 'I have always done a lot of walking and cycling and that is how I’ve managed to stay active all these years.

'Longevity is also down to having good genes to start with, but you also have to be very tough.

'I used to cycle to Yorkshire and Scotland, back when there were no sign posts.

'I remember years ago when a woman asked me if I could swim and I said no, so she just threw me into the pool.

'Then she asked me again if I could swim, so I said yes and that’s how I learned.

'I have been very lucky health wise in my life. I’ve got trouble with my legs but I stay tough mentally, so I get by.'

Dorothy’s 103rd birthday party was arranged by friends and family, who used the landmark occasion to celebrate her time as a Girl Guide.

Sue Dutton, County Commissioner for the Girl Guides, met Dorothy three years ago and described her as ‘a remarkable woman.’

She said: 'When we heard about Dorothy’s history with the guides, we visited her and she took out photographs of her time with the guild and it was just amazing.

'The things she has done during her time as a guide are just inspirational so we asked her to open our 100 year exhibition and she agreed.

'We were really blown away when we first went to meet her.

'She told us all about her time as a guide and she was the life and soul of our opening party at Port Sunlight. She is a remarkable woman.'

During her lifetime Dorothy has seen 19 prime ministers, two world wars and five monarchs.
