Former Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack claimed Mesut Ozil should have fought harder to stay at Real Madrid. 

The 37-year-old was at a loss to explain Ozil's poor form for Arsenal but suggested that a player of his quality should have tried harder to remain at the Spanish giants.

Ballack also mentioned that the same old problems were flaring up for Ozil as, like when he was at Real, the midfielder has struggled to deal with criticism.

Michael Ballack said a player of Mesut Ozil's quality should have fought harder to stay at Real Madrid

Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: 'What's happened with him? I don't know. There must be something behind (the scenes) because his head is mostly down, the body language is not improving even with the world champion (medal) in the pocket. 

'I don't really know what's happened over the last year since he moved from Madrid to Arsenal.

'A player like him with his ability should have tried to stay longer at Real Madrid.

'That is my opinion. You could see there was a little bit trouble, a little bit moaning. I think he played well but you need time to adapt at a club.

Ozil has struggled for form since moving from Madrid for £42.5 and has drawn criticism for his performances

'If there is some ups and downs (at a club) you need to fight these things.

'And now it's a little bit the same situation. He got criticised here (at Arsenal), he's not at his best but I don't see a reaction. 

'A player like him with his ability should show a reaction but he never was the strongest player in terms of fighting, body language. 

'That's his weakness - especially in these situations now when he can't use his technique and his vision. 

Ballack claimed Arsenal fans should trust Wenger's judgement when it comes to Ozil's position in the team

But Ballack, who himself won 98 caps for Germany, insisted Ozil was a great player and could get over his rough patch. Moreover, he insisted that when it comes to Ozil's position, Arsenal fans should trust Arsene Wenger. 

He said: 'When you a buy a player like Ozil you know his strengths and Arsene Wenger knows I think where he is at his best. 

'If he (wenger) thinks he can help the team more as a No 10 I think he would put him at No 10.

'In his younger ages when he grew up from Schalke and Werder Bremen he was mostly in the (centre of) midfield so he felt very comfortable there but in terms of pace he's good on the side as well. 

'But, he needs to learn how to defend as well because on these winger positions you need to defend. 

'At this level, if one player's out you have no chance.'

The former Chelsea man insisted Ozil can play on the wing, but needs to learn how to defend properly
