Thirty-one people are dead and more than 90 injured after attackers drove their cars into an open-air market in China and hurled explosives out the windows.

The attack occurred at 7.50am local time in the city of Urumqi, the capital of the volatile Xinjiang region, and has been described as a 'serious violent terrorist incident' by China's Ministry of Public Security.

Two 4x4 vehicles rammed into shoppers in an open market, Xinhua news agency reported, citing witness reports.

Explosives were flung out of the vehicles, and one of the vehicles exploded.

One
 witness told Reuters he saw the aftermath of the blasts on his way to 
work

'The air was full of the smell of gunpowder and the sound of 
sobbing,' he said. 'There were simply too many (casualties), old folks 
who were at the morning market.'

A business owner told Xinhua he had heard a dozen loud explosions at the market near Renmin Park in downtown Urumqi.

A blast has rocked the capital of China's western region of Xinjiang, after explosives were hurled from two vehicles, killing and injuring at least 31 people

Reports about the incident are being posted on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, with users saying they saw flames and heavy smoke after witnessing multiple explosions

Xinjiang
 has been plagued by violence for years, but rights activists and exile 
groups say the government's own heavy handed policies in the region have
 sowed the seeds of unrest.

Photos
 posted on social media purportedly of the blast, but not verified by 
Reuters, showed a column of smoke and chaos at the market, with bloodied
 people lying on the tree-lined road near small stands selling fruit, 
vegetables and eggs.

'There
 were two vehicles that drove like crazy towards the morning market,' 
another witness who declined to give his name told Reuters by telephone.
 'The market was total chaos.

 Xi Jinping said police would 'step up patrols and security controls 
over possible terrorist targets and prevent ripple effects', Xinhua 
reported. Xi vowed to 'severely punish terrorists'.

A working group led by Guo Shengkun, China's Minister of Public Security, was dispatched to the region to investigate.

The attack was the deadliest in a recent series targeting crowded public places in China.

In March, 29 people were stabbed to death at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming.A bomb and knife attack earlier this month at an Urumqi train station killed one bystander and wounded 79.

A
 car burst into flames at the edge of Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 
October, killing five people, in what Beijing said was a terrorist 
attack.

China has said 
Islamist militants from Xinjiang carried out the attacks. Separatist 
groups in Xinjiang are seeking to form their own state called East 
Turkestan.

Xinjiang, 
resource-rich and strategically located on the borders of central Asia, 
is home to the Uighur people, a mostly Muslim ethnic group who speak a 
Turkic language and are culturally distinct from China's ethnic Han 
majority.

Violent riots 
shook the region in 2009, when hundreds of locals took to the streets in
 Urumqi, burning and smashing vehicles. Dozens were killed in the 
unrest.

But exiles and 
rights groups say China's repressive policies that have targeted 
religious freedoms and economic opportunities for Uighurs are the 
culprits when it comes to unrest.

In
 recent weeks, China has strengthened a crackdown on Uighurs in the 
region, jailing dozens for spreading extremist propaganda and 
manufacturing arms, among other charges.

Christopher
 Johnson, a former China analyst at the CIA, said China's leadership may
 come to the realisation that a policy of constantly tightening controls
 on Xinjiang may not be effective in preventing attacks.

'I'm
 kind of doubtful that they are going to announce some sort of more 
liberal policy,' said Johnson, who now works at the Center for Strategic
 and International Studies in Washington.

'But
 sooner or later I think they are going to have to come to that reality 
because the evidence is just smacking them in the face.'

A timeline of recent violent incidents linked to tensions in China's far northwestern region of Xinjiang between its native Turkic Muslim Uighur ethnic group and China's majority Han. China tightly controls information about such incidents, and it's not always clear what transpired or the exact number of victims and attackers killed.

Aug. 4, 2008: Two Uighur men steal a dump truck and drive it into a group of policemen in the far western city of Kashgar, killing 16 people. The attack comes just days ahead of the opening of the Beijing Olympics, fulfilling expectations that extremists would attempt to disrupt the games.

July 5-7, 2009: Violence breaks out between police and protesting Uighurs in central Urumqi, then spreads through much of the city. A total of 197 people are killed, most of them Han Chinese, in the worst bloodshed in Xinjiang in decades.

July 18, 2011: A group of young Uighur men attack government offices and a police station outside the city of Hotan in southern Xinjiang, killing two officers and two hostages. Of the 18 attackers, 14 are shot dead.

April 24, 2013: Gang members stab and burn neighborhood security patrol officers and then police in a village outside Kashgar, killing 21 officers and local government officials.

June 26, 2013: Assailants raid police and government offices in the eastern Xinjiang town of Lukqun, killing 24 officers and civilians. Police say the attackers belonged to a 17-member extremist Islamic cell.

Oct. 28, 2013: A jeep carrying a Uighur man, his wife and her mother jumps a curb in downtown Beijing and plows through tourists before coming to a stop in front of Tiananmen Gate and exploding into flames. Five people are killed, including those in the vehicle and two tourists, in the first such incident known to have taken place in the capital.

March 1, 2014: Five knife-wielding men and women slash at people at the railway station in the southwestern city of Kunming in Yunnan province, killing 29. The attack is the biggest ever outside Xinjiang, and results in stepped-up security nationwide.

April 30, 2014: Two suspected suicide bombers detonate their explosives at the exit to the Urumqi train station, killing themselves and one other person. Another eight people attack passengers with knives, leaving a total of 79 injured.

May 22, 2014: Two trucks plow through crowds at an open air market in Urumqi as explosives are tossed from their windows. Thirty-one people are killed and 94 injured, the largest number of victims in a single incident of violence involving Xinjiang tensions in recent history.
