Feathered friend: The Viscount circa 1935, with Blue Boy the macaw perched on his shoulder at a garden party at Tredegar House

He was one of the richest peers of the realm, a multi-millionaire with such a stash of inherited wealth he never needed to think about working.

But Evan, Viscount Tredegar, was more than your average spoilt aristocrat — he was one of the most riotously outrageous and toxic eccentrics ever to emerge from the English upper classes.

He studied for the priesthood, but practised black magic and befriended sinister occultist Aleister Crowley.

Even though he married an English actress and a Russian princess, he was a promiscuous homosexual.

He wrote poetry and dressed like Shelley, yet he was so juvenile that he trained his parrot Blue Boy to climb the inside of his trouser-leg and pop its head out of his flies.

The bizarre viscount even ran a homing-pigeon scheme for military intelligence during World War II, but was court-martialled for revealing its secrets to two Girl Guides.

And all around him, as he made his wayward path through life, friends had the mysterious habit of dying. 

‘His friendship was a kind of curse,’ says William Cross, author of a new biography of the Welsh peer.

Evan Tredegar became a figure of horrified fascination to High Society Britain in the Twenties and Thirties as he pursued his twin lusts — higher learning and sex.

What else would you expect from a man whose mother believed herself to be a kingfisher and built bird’s nests big enough to sit in?

The dystopian world that Evan Frederic Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar, built for himself was only made possible by colossal wealth.

When he came of age, the vast Welsh estate his family had owned since the 14th century was bringing in the equivalent of £65,000 a day — or £24 million a year.

Home was Tredegar House, a ghostly, depressingly ugly pile near Newport in South Wales.

Evan’s father had made himself useful during the First World War by handing over his private yacht to the Royal Navy — on condition that he was appointed its captain.

Money rather than service bought the gold braid with which he festooned himself — so while he was still a schoolboy, Evan learned that a title, and colossal wealth, could get you anything you wanted.

At Eton, he forged the friendships that were to shape his screwball life. His best friend Peter Churchill, a cousin of Winston, spent part of his childhood in North Africa and claimed to have sold sexual favours to men in return for pocket-money.

W  hile still at Eton the pair became pageboys to the royal court at Windsor at a time when, author Cross claims, ‘mothers of vulnerable sons were known to insist their cherished boys steer well clear of the well-known paedophiles at court’.

But it was too late — both boys had already acquired a preference for their own sex, and before long Evan was kicked out of Eton under the inevitable cloud.

It further counted against him that while at school he had created a circle of black-magic enthusiasts.

Inspired by Peter Churchill’s tales from North Africa of temples, casbahs, souks and arcades where magicians and tricksters plied their trade, the boys dabbled in rites and rituals which were to become a central part of Evan’s life.

With no need to work, Evan settled on becoming a poet.

The first timer: Despite never hiding his homosexuality and having a constant string of illicit affairs, Viscount Tredegar married Viscountess Lois Sturt in 1928

Moving in the arty circle centred on the bohemian Cafe Royal in London, he became friends with the painter Augustus John and the writer Ronald Firbank, a dandy with red-lacquered fingernails.

During this period Evan developed a taste for partying and buying sex from working-class rent boys.

The viscount was no looker — Virginia Woolf described him as ‘a little red absurdity with a beak of a nose, no chin, and with the general likeness of a callow but student bantam cock that has run to seed’.

And in the helter-skelter world of Britain after World War I, filled with flappers and cocktails and drug addicts, Evan was constantly in search of newer, darker, sensations.

He was fatally attracted to dangerous people.

The occultist Aleister Crowley was known to society as ‘the wickedest man in the world’ and in the Twenties people were genuinely terrified by the mention of his name — a byword for all that was mad, bad and dangerous to know.

Born the son of a brewer in Leamington
Spa, Crowley, who called himself ‘The Great Beast 666’, had built up a 
terrifying reputation as a disciple of the Devil.

His stated purpose was to destroy the country’s religious and spiritual equilibrium.

Little wonder then that the vicious Viscount, with his schoolboy dabblings in the occult, should hasten to Crowley’s side — the pair met for the first time in Paris.

Later Crowley went to stay at Tredegar House where Evan proudly revealed his Black Magick room — ‘far greater than I thought!’ marvelled Crowley.

Despite his ostentatiously weird life — in his garden he kept a boxing kangaroo, a honey bear and a baboon, while in his bed he kept rabbits — Evan Morgan was still considered by ambitious mothers to be one of the country’s most eligible bachelors.

Only when girls got close to him did they realise how completely impossible life at Tredegar House would be.

However, Lois Sturt, daughter of the land-rich Lord Alington, was not so choosy.

She had some of the same madness that infected Evan Tredegar and a whole swathe of the post-war Bright Young People. Needy, nervy, self-centred and eccentric, she was also pretty, sexy and willing to overlook Evan’s homosexuality.They married when she was 28 and he 35.

But it was doomed from the start. Lois had already developed an addiction to drugs which would kill her before long.

When they married in Knightsbridge, the crowds had to be held back by police, but the high-society union between Lois and Evan was not what it seemed.

Each agreed the other could sleep with whom they pleased as long as it didn’t interfere with their life together.

But Evan’s relentless all-male promiscuity and his love of rent boys soon rattled Lois, and before long they parted.

Later
he married the shapely Princess Olga Sergievna Dolgorouky, a refugee 
scarred by her escape from the Russian Revolution, but otherwise an 
innocent abroad.

The marriage was annulled, unsurprisingly, on the grounds of his non-consummation after three years.

Evan showed far greater devotion to his menagerie at Tredegar than he did to either of his wives.

Birds were a big part of his life. His Australian parrot, though described by Evan as ‘witless and uncontrollable’, was nothing of the sort.

After teaching it the trick of crawling up the inside of his trouser leg and poking its head out of his flies, the Viscount promptly walked into the Cafe Royal and performed the routine in front of a packed house.

One of the onlookers recorded that ‘the effect on old ladies present can be imagined’.

Periodically, Evan would decide that he must do something serious with his life.

When war was declared in 1939, he managed to get himself taken on by MI14, the secret service department detailed to handle carrier pigeons bringing back messages from frontline troops in France.

So unused was he to the discipline which goes with military work, that he let two Girl Guides look at the map used to plan the 1942 Allied attack on  Dieppe — which, coincidentally, turned out to be one of the war’s greatest military disasters.

Such was the horror of superior 
officers when they learned that he had divulged highly secret troop 
deployment details — even though it was only to a couple of teenage 
girls — that Tredegar was court-martialled.

Story of a life: Evan Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar, died in April 1949, aged 55, survived by his beloved parrot

He
was found guilty and banished to an honorary post in the Welsh Home 
Guard, but even that small responsibility proved too much for him.

Hopeless in war, the Viscount remained equally rudderless  in peace.

Throughout his life the ostensibly 
high-minded Evan described himself as a poet, modelling himself on 
Shelley and even dressing as the Romantic poet, but he failed to attract
the praise of any but the most sycophantic critics.

Rich though he was,
Evan could not buy literary success — and rich though he remained, he 
could no longer buy friendship in the way he once had.

Indeed, his friendship was something of a curse.

Those who were close to Evan seemed to die in their droves — often tragically young.

First was Guy Colebrooke, a fellow royal pageboy, who died aged 27.

Then Ronald Firbank died of lung cancer at the age of 40.

He was followed by fellow-drinker Sir Guy ‘Fatty’ Laking, who succumbed to alcohol poisoning at 26.

One of Evans’s lovers, the Earl of Lathom, keeled over from tuberculosis brought on by a dissipated life, while another lover, the Hon James Rodney, was killed in a house fire.

Friends Peter Watson, a wealthy art patron, and Sir Johnnie Philipps both drowned in their baths.

And another friend, the artist Nina Hamnett, plunged out of a window, impaling herself on the railings 40ft beneath.

There were suicides, too: the artist Kit Wood, the composer Peter Warlock, fellow Etonian Brian Howard and writer Richard Rumbold.

Even his first wife’s brother, the Hon Gerard Sturt, killed himself.

His sister Gwyneth succumbed to drug abuse and her body was found washed up on the Thames shore in 1924.

And so the party — that gay, abandoned, reckless party of parrots, poetry and promiscuity — eventually ended.

Evan Morgan, whose riches so completely detached him from life, finally parted company with it on April 27, 1949 — a victim to cancer at the early age of 55.

The trouser-climbing parrot survived him.
