A woman who has been imprisoned for more than 30 years for the 1976 murder of a 19-year-old nursing student is set to be released this week, now that another man has been connected to the crime with DNA evidence.

Cathy Woods, 64, was being treated at the Louisiana State University Medical Center in 1976 when she confessed to killing Michele Mitchell.

Mitchell was found dead near the University of Nevada's Reno campus on February 24, 1976 - her throat slashed shortly after her car broke down.

Release: Cathy Woods, 64, is set to be released from prison this week as she awaits a retrial in the 1976 murder case of college student Michele Mitchell. DNA evidence now ties a man to the slaying. Pictured above in court yesterday

Confession: Woods (left) confessed to killing Mitchell (right) while being treated as a mental patient at the Louisiana State University Medical Center. Her public defender believes she only confessed in order to be deemed dangerous, and get a single bedroom at the mental hospital. Pictured above in court on September 8

The psychiatric patient's public defender says she only admitted to the killing so that staff would think she was dangerous, and let her have her own room at the mental hospital.

New suspect: Rodney L Halbower, an inmate in an Oregon penitentiary, recently submitted DNA evidence which now connects him to a cigarette butt found on Mitchell's dead body

'I'm told it was a product of wanting to get a private room,' her public defender Maizie Pusich said. 'She was being told she wasn't sufficiently dangerous to qualify, and within a short period she was claiming she had killed a woman in Reno.'

'I suspect the reason why she thought of this case is because this was the case everybody around her was talking about. This is something she would have heard about many, many times,' Pusich added to SFGate.

Recently obtained DNA evidence, however, links known Reno-area killer Rodney L Halbower to the crime.

A judge accepted Woods' petition for a re-trial, and will be released this week to her family in Bakersfield to await her new court date, July 13, 2015.

‘We are delighted that Cathy gets to go home and we get to try to prove to the rest of the world she was innocent all along,’ Pusich said after the hearing. ‘It's a horribly sad situation but thank goodness today we are moving the right direction.’  

Justice: Halbower was sent to prison not long after Mitchell's murder, the the rape of a blackjack dealer just a few blocks from where the nursing student's body was found

Left for dead: Saleswoman Denise Lampe was raped, murdered and dumped outside a busy shopping mall 

Halbower, 66, only recently submitted a DNA sample after being transferred in 2013 to a prison in Oregon. That sample matches a cigarette butt that was found underneath Mitchell's body.

'No DNA found at the Michelle Mitchell crime scene belongs to Cathy Woods,' her lawyer said.

The FBI said in a statement issued in San Francisco later Monday that Halbower had been named as a person of interest in the killings of five young women in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1976 known as the 'Gypsy Hill Murders.'

Veronica Cascio, 18, was snatched off the street while walking to a bus stop at Bradford Way and Fairway Drive; her body was later found on the Sharp's Park Golf Course, Mercury News reported. 

Just weeks later, Tanya Blackwell, 14, went missing while walking from her home, and her badly decomposed remains were discovered only six months later off Gypsy Hill Road.

Paula Baxter, 17, was abducted February 4, 1976, as she left a school play rehearsal. The high school student was stabbed to death and had her head bashed in.

Carol Lee Booth, a 26-year-old housewife, was discovered in a shallow grave near Colma Creek in March, and the following month, saleswoman Denise Lampe was raped, murdered and dumped outside a busy shopping mall. 

Halbower was first sentenced to prison in Nevada for sexually assaulting a female blackjack dealer in downtown Reno in November 1975, an attack that occurred roughly two months before Mitchell was killed a few blocks away, Woods' Pusich said.

He was later sentenced to two life terms for rape and other charges.

He escaped from prison twice but was recaptured before being paroled in 2013 to begin serving sentences in Oregon.

FBI spokesman Peter Hill disclosed in March that the DNA on the cigarette butt in Reno matched that of semen gathered from at least one crime scene in San Mateo, California, and that FBI agents had reopened the series of cold cases. 

Pusich said Monday the DNA found at two of those California rape-murder scenes also belonged to Halbower.

Woods' brother, Al Carter, 58, told reporters with tears in his eyes after the hearing that he had heard there were other suspects in the 1976 killing. 

‘I'm so happy,’ he said about the possibility of closure for his sister and the family of Mitchell.

Woods was convicted of the murder in 1980, won an appeal before the Nevada Supreme Court but was convicted again in 1985. 

Carter said he had tried to maintain hope his sister would be freed eventually but was starting to fear she would end up dying in prison.

‘I've heard her talk about appeals forever, but she has talked about it for so long, I thought maybe that was her mental condition,’ he said. ‘It turns out, wow, she's right.’
