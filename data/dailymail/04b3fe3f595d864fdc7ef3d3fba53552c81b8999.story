Superstar footballer Cristiano Ronaldo last night denied cheating on his girlfriend with a Brazilian model who won the title 'Miss BumBum' in a catwalk competition.

Andressa Urach had claimed the Real Madrid striker slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a key Champions League semi final which his team lost 4-1 to German side Borussia Dortmund.

The 27-year-old told The Sun: 'I have always thought Cristiano is one of the most gorgeous men in the world, so I couldn't believe it when he got in touch with me.

'He said he was very excited by my 
pictures online and one of the first things he asked me was if I really 
was a Miss Butt Brazil model.'

But Ronaldo said in a statement on Twitter last night: ‘I was informed that The Sun, faithful to its editorial line, will publish an article where is given voice to a so called Andressa - someone seeking the limelight on my account.

‘And I wonder why this happens one day before a very important game for my team. Deeply outraged by a situation intended, in vain, to affect my personal life.

‘I just want to clarify I was in fact at the Hotel Villa Magna on April 22 giving an interview to Manu Sainz, something the reporter himself is able to corroborate. Everything else is pure fiction and forgery.'

The woman had told The Sun it happened a day after the £80million former Manchester United forward was pictured leaving a restaurant in Madrid with his girlfriend Irina Shayk. Miss Shayt, 27, had her arms crossed and wore a downcast face.

Speaking about their tryst, she said: 'It was incredible, his body's perfect, like a Greek god. He went on for hours and would not stop talking about my butt.'

Miss Urach claimed Ronaldo told her he had dreamed about her behind and called her his 'little horse' before asking her to come to Madrid and meet up.

Miss Urach told how the pair linked up at the city's £12,500-a-night Villa Magna hotel after she took a taxi there and waited for him in the lobby.

He arrived in a grey Audi R3 and parked in an underground car park before taking a private lift to his room, from where he texted her his room number, The Sun reported.

Ronaldo is dating Russian beauty Miss Shayk, who is known as one of the world's top swimwear and lingerie models.

On Thursday she was in the UK attending the launch of the new Eleven Paris store in London.

The couple started dating three years ago -  just weeks before Ronaldo announced he had become a father to a baby son with an unnamed American mother.

Although
the Real Madrid player announced he had 'exclusive guardianship' of the 
tot Cristiano Jnr, his mother Dolores is helping to raise the child in 
Portugal.

Over the past few years, Irina seemed to have  embraced the role as surrogate stepmother to the child and has been seen doting over the little boy on frequent occasions.

However, since they started dating in May 2010, the couple regularly go for weeks or sometimes months without seeing each other.

Irina is based in New York for her modelling work, but travels all over the 
world, while Ronaldo splits his time between Madrid and his native 
Portugal.
