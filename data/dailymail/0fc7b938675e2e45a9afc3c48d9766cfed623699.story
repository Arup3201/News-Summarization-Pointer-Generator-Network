Gareth Bale says he is feeling stronger than ever after a full summer of rest and is ready to lead Real Madrid’s quest to win six trophies next season.

If they are to pull off the grand slam they will have to become the first team ever to retain the Champions League but Bale, who goes back to Cardiff next month to compete for the first of those cups, believes anything is possible after another summer of spending in the Spanish capital.

Speaking from Real Madrid’s training camp in California Bale said: 'We have six trophies that we can win and we want to win all of them. It will be special playing the Super Cup in Cardiff. That’s the first one we can win but we will be fighting for everything.

'It’s exciting to start the season as the best team in Europe. I don’t know if that will mean more pressure this season but we certainly have more hunger than ever. We want to retain our Champions League.'

Asked about the advantage of not having played in the World Cup he added: 'It was disappointing not being in Brazil but I have had seven weeks of rest and I can now have a full pre-season.

'I want to have an even better season than last year: I want to give more assists and score more goals; I want to improve in every aspect.'

Last year as Bale’s transfer from Tottenham dragged on beyond the start of the season and he was left playing catch-up with his fitness. There were even doubts over whether he had been worth Real’s huge investment.

He said: 'It was tough adapting without a pre-season but this season will be different in that sense. It was a massive change for me but in time I have become very comfortable here.'

This year it is the turn of James Rodriguez to fit into his new surroundings. Bale said: 'He showed what a great player he is at the World Cup. Hopefully he can repeat that form for us next season.

'The Spanish league is the most exciting at the moment. The best players are playing here and Barça and Real Madrid are always fighting for the Champions League. It’s an honour to play in this league.'

Real Madrid will win six trophies if they retain the Champions League, win the Copa del Rey and La Liga, and lift the World Club Cup, the Spanish Super Cup and the European Super Cup to be played in Cardiff on August 12.
