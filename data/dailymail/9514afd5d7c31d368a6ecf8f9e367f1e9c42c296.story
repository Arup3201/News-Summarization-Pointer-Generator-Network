It was an inscription which confounded Illinois librarians for years.

On the inside cover of a 'scientific' book justifying racism was a note believed to be penned by the US President who ended slavery, Abraham Lincoln. 

Now historians have confirmed the Great Emancipator read 'Types of Mankind' and authored the message around 1861, the year he was inaugurated as president, to better educate himself about his opponents' line of thinking.

Racist tome: Historians have confirmed Abraham Lincoln's handwriting inside a tattered book, 'Types of Mankind', justifying racism that he may have read to better understand his opponents' thinking on slavery

Abraham Lincoln wrote:  'C. H. Moore, EsqClintonDe Witt CoIlls.'Beneath that is a handwritten attestation by attorney Lawrence Weldon:'The above was written by Prest Lincolnin 1861 - Just before he left forWashington. L Weldon.'

'There are certain letters of the 
alphabet that Lincoln wrote in a way that were not common to his era,' Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum Curator James 
Cornelius said, referencing Lincoln's style of writing E's and N's.

'A 
forger can typically do some of the letters in a good Lincolnian way. 
They'll give themselves away on a couple of the others. This all adds 
up.'

The 700-page book, published in 1854, extolled the 'scientific' theory that different races were created at different times and thus could not be equal.

Popular among racists and slave owners during the Civil War era, the book argued it was part of the natural order that white people would enslave Africans and Native Americans.

Librarians at Vespasian Warner Public Library in Clinton, Illinois, where the book was held, had long known of rumors that the handwriting was Lincoln's but never checked its authenticity.

The note said: 'C.H. Moore Esq, Clinton, De Witt Co, Ills.'

Underneath that was an attestation by another writer.

'We didn't know whether we should take it seriously,' the library's assistant director Bobbi Perryman said.

Lincoln rarely wrote in books, according to historians, and this note didn't bear a recognizable signature.

According to Pantagram, Lincoln had borrowed the book from attorney Clifton H. Moore, his friend.

Lincoln allegedly wrote the note in 1861 so the book would be returned to Moore, its rightful owner.

Pantagram theorized that Moore lent Lincoln the book to assist Lincoln with a legal case.

Lincoln reportedly had a client at DeWitt County, Bill Dungey, whose brother-in-law called him 'a negro' and 'Black Bill' to people in town because of his dark skin. 

Dungey explained that he was part Portuguese and sued for libel because being classed as a black man would undermine his marriage to the accuser's sister.

Lincoln won the case.

Local attorney Clifton Moore donated thousands of books to the system, 
which formed the basis of the Illinois library's circulating collection when it 
opened in the early 1900s.

Library director Perryman
 said the library doesn't know exactly when the book was retired from 
circulation - only that it suffered significant wear and tear from being
 borrowed for so many years.

Perryman
 said the library is currently keeping the book in its safe deposit box,
 with plans to restore it eventually and put it on display in a secure 
place.
