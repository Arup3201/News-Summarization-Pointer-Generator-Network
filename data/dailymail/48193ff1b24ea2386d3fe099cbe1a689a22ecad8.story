The new arrival will enjoy an idyllic country upbringing with Prince George as their parents move into their Norfolk home later this month.

Despite official claims that Kensington Palace will remain the family’s primary residence, the Cambridges will increasingly use Anmer Hall as their main base – particularly as they will have two children under two by next spring.

The ten-bedroom Georgian mansion was a present from the Queen following their wedding and has undergone a complete refurbishment, paid for by the couple.

With William’s new role as a pilot with East Anglia Air Ambulance Service based in Cambridge – less than an hour’s drive away – it is inevitable they will spending most of their time in Norfolk.

William’s decision to put off full-time royal duties for at least another two and a half years was always going to offer the perfect window to add to his family.

Both he and Kate never made a secret of the fact that they wanted more children and his new career choice offers them the chance to bring up them up outside the goldfish bowl of full-time royal life.

William is a country boy at heart – his late mother Diana often described her sons as being like ‘caged lions’ in the city. 

Newly renovated: The royal couple have privately complained of feeling ‘trapped’ in their 22-room home at Kensington Palace in London, which is pictured yesterday after news of the Duchess's pregnancy broke

The prince is believed to want his children to enjoy the same carefree, rural existence he experienced on the Royal Family’s vast estates in Norfolk, Scotland and Gloucestershire.

Both he and Kate have also privately complained of feeling ‘trapped’ in their 22-room home at Kensington Palace, which has recently undergone a top-to-toe renovation, funded in part with £4.5million of taxpayers’ money.

The duchess, in particular, has come to resent the paparazzi who have taken to hanging around Kensington Gardens and other parks in the hope of photographing her pushing one-year-old George in his buggy. 

Although the pictures have so far not been used in the UK, there is a lucrative market for them abroad.

And while their spokesman insists that Kensington Palace will remain the couple’s ‘primary and long-term’ official residence, it is all too clear Anmer Hall, which has its own swimming pool and tennis court, will be considered their home.

Living there will allow William, when he is on the day shift, to get home from work in time to help out with his children’s nightly bath – something he has said he enjoys immensely – and be a hands-on father.

The property has had trees planted to shield it from public view and will be guarded round the clock by armed police, while an alarm system has been installed. A source said: ‘Regardless of what anyone says, Anmer Hall will be the couple’s family home.’
