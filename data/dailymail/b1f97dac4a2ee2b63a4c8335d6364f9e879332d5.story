Two women and a man have been jailed for a total of 21 years after being caught on CCTV violently attacking and then robbing a defenceless man.

The sickening footage shows the 40-year-old victim being punched to the ground by the thugs, dragged away from a main road in Eastbourne, Sussex, and kicked in the head while lying helpless in the street.

Louise Gould, 31, Lauren St Pierre, 25, and Wayne Rogers, 29, were walking together after a night out before they saw the man and decided to target him.

Targeted: The shocking footage shows the victim being punched in the head in Eastbourne, Sussex, by a group of thugs

Ganging up: The group then start to kick the man as he lies helplessly on the floor

Rogers, wearing a white hooded-jumper, pushed him against a wall, before punching him in the head.

As the man fell to the ground, he directed another blow to his face.

Then, the two woman are captured on another surveillance camera violently kicking the man on the floor.

A passer-by tries to intervene, urging the group to walk away, but moments later they return and continue the brutal assault.

The trio then went through the mans pockets and stole his mobile phone before casually walking off after they were interrupted by a passer-by.

Intervention: The trio briefly walk away from the scene after a passer-by urges them to leave the man alone

The unidentified man bravely stepped forward and asked them to leave the victim alone.

The
 victim was taken to hospital with severe bruising to his head and face 
after the assault in the early hours of Friday 26th April 2013.

Paramedics called police and officers were able to track down witnesses and the CCTV footage that clearly identified the offenders and was pivotal in securing a conviction at a trial at Lewes Crown Court.

Gould was jailed for nine years, Rogers was jailed for seven years and St Pierre was jailed for five years.

Detective Sergeant John Steven said: 
'This was a sickening attack on an innocent man who was on his way home 
after a night out with friends.'

'He was subjected to a vicious attack that could have been even worse if a member of the public had not bravely intervened.

'It is a miracle that the victim did not suffer any life-changing or life-threatening injuries.'
