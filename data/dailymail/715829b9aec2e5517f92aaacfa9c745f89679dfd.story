John Ibrahim has visited his brother, convicted killer Michael Ibrahim, in hospital after he was shot as he returned to his luxury Sydney flat.

Ibrahim was hit in the shoulder by one of a number of bullets fired at him on his way home in Macquarie Street in Sydney's CBD on Sunday night.

Detectives are reportedly investigating whether the shooting is linked to a feud between the Ibrahim clan and other notorious criminal families, reports the Daily Telegraph.

Police are hunting for a gunman after a man was shot while standing on a footpath just metres from NSW Parliament House on Sunday night

A crime scene remained on Monday outside Ibrahim's luxury Macquarie Street home where he has lived since he left prison in August 2014

Michael Ibrahim spent more than six years in prison after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Robin Nassour in 2006.

He was acquitted in 2012 of conspiring to murder nightclub owner John Macris, who he believed was responsible for gunning down his brother, Fadi Ibrahim, outside a home in Sydney's north.

Sam Ibrahim has been behind bars on firearms charges since his bail was revoked in July last year.

Family, friends and associates, including brother John, flocked to St Vincent's Hospital where Michael Ibrahim has been recovering since the shooting about 10.30pm on Sunday.

The 36-year-old has been sitting up and in good spirits in a stable condition, said hospital spokesman David Faktor on Monday afternoon.

Mr Faktor said the patient had not undergone surgery, correcting earlier information.

Meanwhile, police continued their investigation at the scene of the attack on one of Sydney's most prestigious strip of apartments.

Police are looking for at least two attackers and a white, possibly late model, Audi.  

Several shots were fired, with a bullet removed from this tree at the scene of the shooting, but Ibrahim only was only shit by one bullet to the shoulder

Mr Ibrahim was sentenced to a maximum nine years and four months behind bars for his role in the manslaughter of Robin Nassour in 2006

Police closed off Macquarie Street shortly after the shooting between Bridge and Bent streets as police scoured the area for bullet casings. 

Apart from the man's gunshot wound, police have received no further reports of injuries. 

The shooting took place outside a multi-storey office building at 151 Macquarie Street - just 200 metres away from NSW Parliament House and less than 300 metres from the scene of the Lindt cafe siege in Martin Place.

Michael Ibrahim had earlier vowed to move on with his life at his August 2014 parole hearing.

He told the board he wouldn't break the law if released from jail and would abide by the "most stringent" parole conditions.

Being behind bars while his mother was treated for cancer was a "wake up call", he told the parole board.

He was granted parole, reportedly subject to a range of strict conditions, including electronic monitoring and keeping away from Kings Cross and other parts of Sydney.
