The dash cam of a police patrol car captured the horrifying moment a driver climbed from his car, raised a gun and shot an officer in the head and chest after he was stopped because of a broken tail light.

Officer Matthew Fox, 29, was in a good condition in hospital following surgery after he was shot three times while sitting in his vehicle. The gunman, who fled the scene after firing off rounds, later died in a shoot out with police.

Officer Fox signaled for James Lockart III, 27, to pull over in Hancock County, just east of Indianapolis last Friday night on a routine traffic stop.

Officer Fox initially called to Lockart, telling him to stick his hands out of the driver's window of the white Volvo but the driver fled. Lockart eventually pulled over in a quiet yard.

Before the patrolman had a chance to get out of his car, the driver got out of his vehicle and shot at the patrol car.

There were multiple bullet holes in the driver’s side of the patrol car and Fox was struck in the hand, forehead and chest.

'Fortunately, that bullet to the forehead did not penetrate any critical area,' police spokesman Kendale Adams said.

Fox was able to describe the suspect and the vehicle in which he had fled to other officers who arrived on the scene.

Fox was taken to a hospital in serious condition but his condition was later upgraded.

Minutes later, Indianapolis and Lawrence police cornered the gunman in a nearby apartment complex, blocking the only way in or out.

The suspect crashed into the rear of a police car as he tried to escape, then left his vehicle and began shooting at officers with an assault rifle. Police said officers returned fire, killing the suspect.

An Indianapolis officer’s arm was grazed by a bullet and a police dog was hit during the gunfight. The officer was treated at the scene and the dog was released from care on Saturday morning.

Lockhart had previous arrests for felony battery, misdemeanor resisting law enforcement and possession of marijuana.
