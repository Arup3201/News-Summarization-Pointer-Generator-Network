Michael Jackson looked like he’d been dead for 20 minutes when an ambulance arrived at his mansion, jurors heard yesterday.

Paramedics Richard Senneff and Martin Blount dashed to the star’s aid after Jackson’s bodyguard called 911.

The crew said they found Jackson lifeless and the star’s personal doctor Conrad Murray evasive about what had happened.

They claimed Murray made no mention 
of the fact Jackson had been injected with propofol, the hospital 
anaesthetic blamed for causing his death.

According to evidence lodged in pre-trial papers, Murray said Jackson wasn’t taking any medication.

When pressed, he said he gave the star lorazepam to help him sleep.

‘It didn’t add up,’ said Mr Senneff.

He recalled that Jackson’s pupils were dilated, his skin was cold and his eyes dry.

He said the 50-year-old looked like ‘a hospice patient’.

However, the paramedic said Murray 
insisted Jackson had only just lost consciousness and had no medical 
problems other than dehydration.

Mr Senneff testified that the singer might have lived if his personal physician Dr Murray had called 911 immediately.

Mr Senneff said there was a good chance that they could have restarted Jackson's heart if they had been called when Murray found the singer unconscious.

Murray appeared frantic when the paramedic arrived in the bedroom on the day of Jackson's death in June 2009, Mr Senneff said.

He was the first paramedic to 
reach Jackson's bedroom and said within moments, he and three other 
paramedics were working to revive Jackson.

He said that Jackson, who was wearing pyjamas and looked underweight, was being moved as he walked in. He said the singer was so thin his ribs were sticking out.

Conrad Murray watches the prosecution make their case today

A Los Angeles judge has ordered attorneys in the trial to not speak publicly about the case.

Judge Michael Pastor said this afternoon that prosecutors and lawyers for Dr Conrad Murray were ordered not to comment outside of their respective legal teams.

Pastor didn't specify the reason for his decision. However, he called Matt Alford, a Houston lawyer who is a partner with Murray's attorney, Ed Chernoff, to return this afternoon.

Mr Alford appeared on NBC's 'The Today Show' this morning, in which he said the jury was smart enough to know prosecutors haven't proven their case.

The lawyer cast doubt on the testimony of Jackson's bodyguard Alberto Alvarez who testified yesterday. He said: 'It's kind of like the old Mark Twain adage, "I remember things that didn't even happen".'

The paramedic said that he noticed an IV
stand with an IV bag hanging on it, but that Murray did not answer when
asked if Jackson had an underlying condition.

He had to ask Murray three times about what condition Jackson had before the doctor answered.

'He said, "Nothing. He has nothing",' Mr Senneff said. 'Simply, that did not add up to me.'

Murray eventually told medics that he was treating the singer for exhaustion and dehydration.

When asked what medications he had 
given Jackson, Mr Senneff said Murray told him that he had only given 
Jackson the sedative lorazepam.

The doctor did not mention that he 
had been giving Jackson the surgical anesthetic propofol to help the 
singer sleep.

The veteran paramedic said Jackson 
was cool to the touch, his eyes were open and dry and had an IV in his 
leg.

He said that when they connected the singer to an EKG it showed a flatline.

As paramedics were about to give up 
they felt a pulse in Jackson's groin. They stopped CPR to check him 
again on a monitor, but again it showed a flatline.

Sugar levels in Jackson's blood also showed no change.

After trying multiple heart-starting medications and other efforts, Jackson was still lifeless.

In a call played to the court, emergency room personnel at a nearby 
hospital advised Mr Senneff to declare Jackson dead in his bedroom.

Mr Senneff said Jackson was transported because Murray wanted the life-saving efforts to 
continue.

The paramedic added that after he 
took Jackson down to the ambulance he returned to the bedroom to pick up
equipment, where he saw Murray picking up items from the floor.

Murray, 58, has pleaded not guilty to
involuntary manslaughter. If convicted, Murray could face up to four 
years in prison and lose his medical license.

Prosecutors contend the Houston-based
cardiologist repeatedly lied to medics and emergency room doctors about
medications he had been giving Jackson in the singer's bedroom.

Authorities contend Murray 
administered a fatal dose of propofol and other sedatives. Murray's 
attorneys claim Jackson gave himself the fatal dose after his doctor 
left the room.

Prosecutors are expected to call another paramedic who treated Jackson.

Murray's trial is expected to last five weeks and is in its fourth day.

The dispatcher calls time of death in
the phone call, but Mr Senneff tells him that Murray wants to continue 
efforts to revive the singer.

An executive for the maker of a medical device used by Michael Jackson's doctor to monitor the singer told jurors today that the equipment was not adequate for the continuous monitoring of patients.

The $275 fingertip device that monitors the pulse and blood oxygen levels was recovered after Jackson's death and was being used by Dr Conrad Murray while he was giving the singer doses of the surgical anesthetic propofol.

Prosecutors called Nonin Medical executive Bob Johnson to try to show that Murray lacked enough equipment to care for the singer during the treatments. Propofol is normally administered in hospital settings.

Mr Johnson said the model that Murray used had no audible alarm and was not intended to be used for the continuous monitoring of patients.

Robert Russell, a former patient of Conrad Murray, on the stand

Jurors also heard from a former 
Murray patient who lauded the doctor's treatment of him, but said his 
cardiologist became increasingly distant and hard to reach while working
with Jackson.

'I felt like I was getting the best 
care in the world,' said Robert Russell of Las Vegas, before Murray 
became the singer's personal physician.

After Murray began treating Jackson, 
Russell said he couldn't get answers about his own treatment. He called 
Murray's office on June 25, 2009 - the day Jackson died - and demanded 
to speak to the doctor.

The doctor left him a voicemail at 
11:49am. Prosecutors are using records to show that Murray was on the 
phone in the moments before he realised Jackson was unconscious.

Russell told jurors Murray's message 
seemed odd because the doctor said he was going on sabbatical, despite 
telling the salesman and his wife months earlier that he was going to 
work for Jackson.
