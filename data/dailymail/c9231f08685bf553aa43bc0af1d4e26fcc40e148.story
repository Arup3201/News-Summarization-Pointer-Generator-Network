A grumpy grandmother who unwrapped what she thought was a brand new iPhone on Christmas Day was overjoyed to discover that the prank present was actually a novelty chocolate bar. 

Jordan Graham, from Utah, bought the sweet treat for his grandma and wrapped it up in an iPhone box, before videoing her reaction when she opened it in front of her family. 

Much to Jordan's delight, his horrified relative - having no doubt never held an iPhone before - has no idea that the cellophane-wrapped phone is in fact a fake made out of chocolate, and quickly begins to grumble to her grandson about the inappropriate present.

Unimpressed: Jordan Graham's grandmother is horrified at the thought of being given a new iPhone for Christmas

'I'm not equipped to handle this': The elderly woman quickly insists that she doesn't need the complicated cellphone because she has a landline at home

'You are kidding me,' she says, glaring at the unwrapped gift. 'I don't [need it], Jordan.

'The problem is that I'm really not equipped to handle this. 

'I have a landline phone at home - nobody knows about them anymore I guess - had it for as many years.'

After pulling the chocolate cellphone out of the iPhone box, she continues to lament the over-complicated technology, without any idea that the offensive gadget is, in fact, a fake.

That is until her grandson tells her to put it in her mouth and take a bite. 

'Open it up,' he says, while filming his grandmother's shocked reaction. 'Now I want you to put it in your mouth... I want you to take a bite out of your phone.'

Relief: Jordan's grandmother is thrilled to learn that her new iPhone is, in fact, a novelty chocolate bar

'Thank god!' The poor woman is so much happier with her chocolate phone, which she declares is 'as sweet as can be'

It takes a few seconds before his poor victim fully understands the joke - but as soon as she realizes that her new phone is actually a fake, her joy and relief are easy to see. 

'Oh thank god!' she exclaims.

'Bless your heart, it's chocolate.' she adds, laughing hysterically. 'So I don't have to worry about what the hell I'm supposed to do with it.'

And while many would no doubt be horrified at such a cruel prank, the elated grandma seems absolutely thrilled with the sweet gift, insisting that she is going to treasure it rather than eating it.

'I'm going to keep it for a little bit,' she says, holding up the fake phone for everyone to see. 'It's just as sweet as it can be! Look at that.'
