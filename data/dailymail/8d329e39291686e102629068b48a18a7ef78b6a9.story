A Queensland mother has claimed she was forced to spend over $2000 on head lice treatment for her daughter due to a perpetual nit problem at her child's school.

Katherine Forster, from Logan City, south of Brisbane, in Queensland, has spent a staggering amount on lice killer over the past year after applying lotion to her daughter Chloe's scalp every two days.

But she says she is still losing the battle against the bugs.

MsForster blamed her daughter's Marsden State Primary School, in Logan City, for allegedly not sending out letters to other parents to warn them of the infestation.

'It's ridiculous. It's a complete outbreak at the moment,' she told Channel Nine's Today show.

'Lately the school hasn't sent any letters so hasn't done anything to help with the outbreak,' she said.

Worried: The Queensland mother is concerned her daughter's school allegedly hasn't contacted other parents

Losing battle: Ms Forster applies treatment to her daughter's head every two days

Chloe appeared with her mother on the show and admitted that there has been a nit problem at her school.

Her concerned mother, said: 'I've spoken to the principal in regards to things that can be done and they just said there's nothing they can do.'

Head lice are small, wingless, egg laying insects, which can grow to about 3.5mm (the size of a sesame seed or pin head). 

Inspection: The costly cream has not not prevented the nits from coming back again and again

They live on the hair and feed by sucking blood from the scalp.

According to advice from the Queensland government, 'all parents should check their children and other family members for head lice regularly'.

The government's website says 'the most effective way to detect head lice is by using the hair conditioner and combing method'.

The school: Ms Forster pointed the blame at Marsden State Primary School, in Logan City, south east Queensland

A spokesperson for the Department of Education, Training and Employment told MailOnline: 'Primary responsibility for the management and treatment of head lice in students belongs with parents, not school staff or nurses.'Clear advice outlining management strategies and communication options in the event of head lice infestations is available to principals on the Department’s website.'If an infestation does occur, schools will determine the most appropriate course of action for addressing the issue at a local level.'The presence of head lice is not a notifiable condition, unlike measles or whooping cough, and there is no legislated requirement for schools to send home letters to parents when advised that a student is being treated for head lice.'The spokesperson added: 'Marsden State School has received one complaint about head lice from a member of the school community, and as such is not aware of a head lice infestation.'The school responded with individual advice for the family to avoid chemical treatments and use comb and conditioner method as per Queensland Health recommendations.'
