The weary faces of the men who endured the trenches of Europe and the determination of those treating them are captured in this forgotten trove of photos.

The timeworn photo album belonging to nurse Catherine Bennett - lost for years in the locked cabinet of an earl’s study - reveals the courage of British troops injured during World War One.

The album was discovered by chance inside a locked drawer of a study in Earl of Stamford's stately home, Dunham Massey in Greater Manchester. 

Stretchered: Men carry an injured soldier into Dunham Massey, which became known as Stamford Military Hospital and treated 282 soldiers between April 1917 and January 1919

The Georgian stately home served as a military hospital between 1917 and 1919, nursing hundreds of traumatised ‘Tommies’ back to health.

The candid images recorded by Sister Catherine and carefully preserved in the gilt-edged album she kept show the range of injures suffered by troops during tortuous exchanges in France and Belgium.

Road to recovery: Sister Catherine captioned this photo 'W Timms in bed with broken leg'. The album reveals the range of injuries suffered by troops in the trenches

'Safely tucked up in bed': the troops were brought to Dunham Massey from the battlefields of France and Belgium

The saloon at Dunham Massey, which was used as a ward: even the lady of the manor rolled up her sleeves to help run the hospital and get the soldiers back to health

Ladies of the manor - including Lady Penelope, widow of the 9th Earl of Stamford - cast away fine clothes and rank to help run the hospital.

And as part of the centenary celebrations for the Great War, National Trust staff who run Dunham will transform the stately home back into Stamford Military Hospital.

They will spend the next few months re-instating wartime features and artefacts for when the home re-opens next March.

Convalescing community: Dunham Massey will be transformed into a military hospital again for next year's centenary of the start of 'war to end all wars'

Nursing times: Sister Catherine Eva Bennett, whose album was lost for years in the locked cabinet of a Cheshire earl's study, and Lady Jane Grey - Lady Penelope's daughter - who was only 15 when war broke out

Household troops: almost 300 soldiers were treated at Dunham Massey. This photo of soldiers and staff is taken in the gardens of the 3,000-acre estate

Sister Catherine’s album was found during a clearout of the study belonging to the tenth Earl, Roger Grey, who died in the 1970s.

The album has now been scanned by conservation staff at Manchester’s John Rylands Library and will play a key role in the new exhibition, ensuring visitors never forget the price paid by British soldiers and the efforts made to save them.
