Cristiano Ronaldo remembered Real Madrid great Alfredo Di Stefano on Monday when receiving his award for scoring the most the goals in the Spanish league last season.

'I want to take advantage of this opportunity to say that it's too bad Don Alfredo Di Stefano can't be here to give me the award,' Ronaldo said at the gala in the Spanish capital.

Real legend Di Stefano died in July after suffering a heart attack in Madrid at the age of 88.

The Argentine forward helped Madrid win five straight European Cup titles from 1956-60. He was voted European player of the year in 1957 and 1959 and named Madrid's honorary president in 2000.

Madrid club president Florentino Perez said on Saturday that Ronaldo was 'a dignified heir to Di Stefano,' to which Ronaldo said that he was humbled by the comparison.

'I watched many videos of him because I didn't see him play (in person), and he was phenomenal,' said Ronaldo. 'Being connected to him is a privilege and an honor. It's something that motivates me to work more. I knew him personally since I arrived at Madrid, and to me he was an exceptional person.'

After just 11 games in La Liga so far this season, Ronaldo has scored a mesmerising 18 goals for Real Madrid 

Ronaldo led La Liga with 31 goals last season, when Madrid finished third behind champions Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.

Ronaldo has had a brilliant start to this season, scoring 23 goals in 17 appearances for Madrid, as he looks to again be named FIFA Ballon d'Or winner. His league-leading 18 goals has helped Madrid to the top of the Spanish standings, two points ahead of Barcelona after 11 games.

'Perhaps I am playing at my best, I am trying to improve on last year,' Ronaldo said. 'I am happy, the team is playing well and getting better. My goal and assist numbers aren't bad.'

Ronaldo's next match will be for Portugal in a European championship qualifier against Armenia on Friday.
