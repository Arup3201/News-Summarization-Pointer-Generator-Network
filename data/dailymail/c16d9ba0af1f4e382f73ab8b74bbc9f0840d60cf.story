An ex-convict with a history of mental illnessÂ  eyed in the stabbing that left a six-year-old boy dead and his seven-year-old friend clinging to life was released from prison only two weeks ago despite a history of mental illness, it has been revealed.

Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was paroled May 23 and is suspected in multiple stabbing attacks that have left two people dead and two others hospitalized in the weeks since.

His original five-and-a-half-year sentence stemmed from attempted murder and assault convictions, records showed.

Accused: Daniel St. Hubert being arraigned Thursday night in Brooklyn criminal court

Cops unknowingly encountered the suspect only hours before the vicious attack in a Brooklyn housing project that sent shockwaves through the city.

He was urinating on a sidewalk when police approached him, sources told the New York Daily News.

He claimed that he didn't know it was illegal and, after showing proper ID, he was released with a summons, said police.

His reported actions over the next few hours are unspeakable.

St. Hubert is accused of entering the Boulevard Houses in East New York, and stabbing to death P.J. Avitto in an elevator.

The attack left Mikayla Capers seriously injured, she is currently fighting for her life in a city hospital.

Victims: Six-year-old P.J. Avitto, left, was stabbed to death in an elevator in his housing block on Sunday, while seven-year-old Mikayla Capers was left in critical condition. St. Hubert has been arrested in the attack

Killed: 18-year-old Tanya Grant-Copeland, pictured, was stabbed on Friday four blocks from where the children were attacked but police are still investigating whether St Hubert could be responsible

The mentally ill man was then arrested
 only hours later for the stabbings after police patrolled the area 
around his mother's home in Queens - and now he is suspected in yet 
another grisly murder, police said.

St. Hubert didn't put up any resistance 
during his arrest, though he has a record of assaulting both a police 
and correction officer, and was angrily ranting to himself in a holding 
cell late Wednesday night, said NYPD spokesperson Stephen Davis.

St. Hubert appears on surveillance 
video near the subway stop where a homeless man was stabbed early 
Wednesday morning on a platform, Davis said.

Witnesses
 to the seemingly random attack also described the suspect using an 
8-to-10-inch knife with a brown handle similar to one recovered on St. 
Hubert when he was arrested, Davis said.

The 52-year-old drifter is recovering in a hospital and expected to survive the disturbing attack.

St. Hubert is also suspected of stabbing to death 18-year-old Tanaya Copeland on Friday four blocks from where the attack of the young children happened, authorities said.

Media frenzy: Reporters and photographers crowd the sidewalk for even just a glimpse of the man accused of the horrific stabbings

Plea: Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce appealed for help tracking down the stabbing suspect hours before he was arrested on Wednesday

Further testing of evidence collected 
at that scene needs to be conducted, Davis said, but a similar knife was
 recovered where Copeland was killed.

St.
 Hubert was being held in a Williamsburg, Brooklyn precinct on Thursday 
and unavailable for comment. It wasn't immediately clear if he had made 
any statements or had asked for an attorney.

Meanwhile, the father of Prince Joshua Avitto, the six-year-old boy who was fatally stabbed, said on Thursday that if he saw the suspect, he'd ask him, 'What made you do this to a little baby?'

'I'm at a loss for words,' Prince's father, Nicholas Avitto, told Fox 5 News. 'The bottom line is he got out and this tragedy took place after he was released from jail.'

St. Hubert was picked up just after 
8pm Wednesday by detectives who had been tracking him, police said. He 
was identified by forensic evidence recovered on the knife at the scene 
of Sunday's elevator stabbing, police said.

At
 a Wednesday evening press conference attended by the mayor, officials 
said investigators believed St. Hubert had no car and may have been 
riding the subways.

Davis said St. Hubert, who has an extensive criminal history, had previously been arrested on disorderly conduct charges for taking up two seats on the subway and other infractions.

St. Hubert hasn't yet been officially charged but murder and assault charges are likely coming, said Davis.
