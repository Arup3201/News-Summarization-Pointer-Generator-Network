The Sanford, Florida police chief in charge of the investigation into the shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin resigned temporarily on Thursday.

Bill Lee Jr., stood down as the outcry over the death of the 17-year-old, gunned down by a neighborhood watch captain as he went to buy candy, spread across the U.S..

It also emerged today that the police officer who first responded to the scene had been previously involved in another racially-charged investigation.

The officer, Anthony Raimondo, was involved in an alleged police cover up of an incident in which the white son of a police lieutenant punched a black homeless man and was never arrested.

The resignation of Mr Lee was the first significant action in the 
case.

'I'm aware that my role as the leader of this agency has become a distraction,' Mr Lee said.

'It is my hope the process would move swiftly and thoroughly through the justice system,' he continued.

His announcement came just hours after the local city commission gave him a vote of no confidence.

During
 the Wednesday meeting, city commissioner Velma Williams said that 
Sanford had long had racial tension and the death of Trayvon Martin is 
hurting any chances of advancement.

'And now this. It's a national embarrassment,' said Ms Williams, who is the only black commissioner.

The actions of the Sanford Police Department following the shooting of Trayvon Martin on February 26.

Immediately after they responded to the scene, they took George Zimmerman back to police headquarters but while there, they did not test him for alcohol or drugs. Considering he is heard slurring his words on the 911 call, that was a particularly agregious move.

Not only that, but playing into to thoughts of Mr Zimmerman, the police instead tested Trayvon's dead body for alcohol and drugs. He was clean.

They allowed Mr Zimmerman to leave the police station without pressing any charges.

And until the very recent press buzz about the case, they proceeded to do no further investigation after that fateful night.

It has taken almost a month for anything to change in the case, which has upset Trayvon's family and their supporters.

Ms Williams nearly fainted after the close vote, which ended up 3-2 against Mr Lee, because she was so emotional.

The
 two commissioners that supported Mr Lee- Patty Mahany and Randy Jones- 
said that the police chief is essentially being given a trial in the 
court of public opinion which is unfair.

The case has
 caught national attention and brought severe scrutiny to the practices 
of the Sanford, Florida police department and their murky history of 
dealing with cases involving racially-motivated crimes.

In the case involving Justin 
Collison, the police lieutenant's son, Mr Raimondo chose not to press 
charges against the boy even though he broke the homeless man's nose. Mr
 Raimondo was the one to release the teen from custody.

There
 was a video of the incident, and the police chose to cover it up. Only 
after local news outlets found out about that cover up did they press 
charges against the boy.

Though
 the police chief at the time resigned in the incident's wake, Mr 
Raimondo was investigated and received a formal complaint.

Including that incident, he has three validated complaints on his file, and another one pending.

Trayvon's parents held a brief press conference shortly after the news was announced saying that they were not satisfied.

'The
 temporary step down of Bill Lee is nothing!' Tracy Martin said after 
meeting with federal investigators to go over the details of the case.

'I'm aware that my role as the leader
 of this agency has become a distraction. It is my hope the process 
would move swiftly and thoroughly through the justice system.'

'We want an arrest! We want a conviction for the murder of my son!' he said to crowds of supporters and fans while standing next to Reverend Al Sharpton.

Trayvon's death was memorialized across the country on Wednesday and there was a massive march in New York in support of Martin's parents who want the shooter, George Zimmerman, arrested.

Others are taking more pointed 
action, and a black militia group have announced that they plan to 
attempt a citizen's arrest on Mr Zimmerman.

The New Black Liberation Militia said 
that they hope to find him and bring him into the custody of federal 
authorities because they feel that the Sanford police have not been 
sufficient.

Coming together: Thousands of protesters, some banding together from other causes, attended the Million Hoodie Rally in Manhattan's Union Square on Wednesday

The latest finding about the 
involvement of Mr Raimondo in both the Collison incident and the latest 
shooting will not reassure them at all.

'We'll find him,' militia leader Najee Muhammed told local WKFTV.

'We have his mugshot and everything.'

This is exactly the kind of action that Trayvon's parents do not want.

Mr Martin and Sybrina Fulton have appeared on numerous talk shows and news segments in an effort to publicize the February 26 shooting and put pressure on the police department to arrest Mr Zimmerman.

While in New York to appear on the Today Show, the parents heard that a Million Hoodie March, named so in honor of Trayvon who was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt at the time of his death, and agreed to speak at the initial rally.

The teen's mother, Sybrina Fulton, told the crowd: 'My heart is in pain, but to see the support of all of you really makes a difference.'

The demonstrators responded: 'God bless you!'

The march started in Union Square and proceeded to splinter off, with some heading north to Times Square and others headed south to the Wall Street bull statue, much like the Occupy Wall Street protesters frequently did.

'We're not going to stop until we get justice,' said the teenager's father, Tracy Martin, after thanking the crowd that marched in Manhattan. 'My son did not deserve to die.'

'I don't feel this is the time to break down, even though it's a very troubling time in my life.

'I've told myself, when I get justice for Trayvon, then I'll have my time to break down.'

The case is now being reviewed by the 
Justice Department's civil rights division to address the tension in 
Sanford. The FBI has also been sent to reopen the case.

Florida is among 21 states with a ‘Stand Your Ground Law,’ which gives people wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat during a fight.

The self-defense law helps explain why a neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman has not been arrested in the shooting death of an unarmed teenager.

The Florida law lets police officers on the scene decide whether they believe the self-defense claim. In many cases, the officer's defer to making the arrest, letting the courts work out whether the deadly force is justified. In this case, however, police have said they are confident they did the right thing by not charging 28-year-old Zimmerman, a white Hispanic.

Martin's family questions Zimmerman's story, and believes if their races were reversed, there is no doubt a black shooter would be jailed, even if he claimed self-defense.

‘They are making it look like Zimmerman is the victim and their son is in the grave,’ said Benjamin Crump, attorney for Martin's parents. ‘It's about equal justice.’

In a statement released Wednesday, Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee insisted his officers were ‘prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time,’ including physical evidence that supported Zimmerman's self-defense claim.

‘The Sanford Police Department has conducted a complete and fair investigation of this incident,’ Lee said, adding that it's now up to prosecutors to determine whether to bring charges.

Late Wednesday, commissioners in Sanford, a city of 53,000 people outside Orlando that is 57 per cent white and 30 per cent black, voted 3-2 to express ‘no confidence’ in the police chief.
