Victor Valdes has been deemed the best goalkeeper in the history of the Spanish league.

The 32-year-old former Barcelona keeper, who is training with Manchester United, topped a list ahead of Thibaut Courtois and Iker Casillas.

The study, carried out by the Centre for Research of Football History and Spanish Statistics (CIHEFE), analysed keepers since 1928.

Victor Valdes spent 12 successful years with Barcelona before leaving this summer

Valdes helped the club win six La Liga titles, three Champions Leagues and six Copa del Reys

Iker Casillas was ranked way down the list in 20th, despite his long and illustrious club and international career

Valdes tops the list ahead of Courtois (Atletico Madrid), Francisco Liano (Racing, Sport and Sporting), Roberto Rodriguez, “Rodri” (Atletico Madrid and Celta) and Mariano Garcia Remon (Real Madrid).

Despite winning 160 caps for Spain, compared to Valdes' meagre 20, Real Madrid's Casillas is ranked way down the list in 20th place.

Meanwhile, Santiago Cañizares was eighth, Luis Maria Arconada 13th and Andoni Zubizarreta 17th.

The report detailed 790 players and concluded Valdes was the ‘ideal prototype’ for a goalkeeper.
