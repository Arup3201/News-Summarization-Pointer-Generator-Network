Costly mistake: Lee Neale, 43, faces a £4,000 bill after his daughter racked up the huge sum playing 'free' games on his iPad

A father has said he may need to sell his car and two motorbikes after his daughter ran up a £4,000 bill playing 'free' games on his iPad.

Lee Neale, 43, had his bank account frozen when Lily, 8, bought in-app extras while playing on the tablet using the password she had seen him entering when downloading items.

Lily ran up a bill of more than £2,000 in just six days and more than £4,000 over the course of five months topping up rewards and enhancements in 74 transactions.

Mr Neale claims the schoolgirl was unaware she was being charged 'real money' for the in-game purchases and asked to Apple to scrap the charge.

But Apple has refused and he now faces selling off his car and two prized off-road motorbikes to recoup the money.

Mr Neale said: 'Lily is only eight and hasn’t grasped the concept of money. She probably wouldn’t know how much a bag of crisps costs.

'I was very surprised how dismissive Apple were. This was an eight-year-old girl. Basically iTunes have told me categorically that I won’t be getting my money back.

'I am also disappointed that my bank didn’t alert me to what was going on.

'Now my dad is having to lend me money in the short term and I’m in the process of selling my car, my son’s off road motorbike and probably my bike too.

'I just think these in-app purchases are terrible and people need to be aware.'

Mr Neale, from Peasedown St John, Somerset, allowed Lily to use his iPad so she could play numerous games including Campus Life, My Horse, Hay Day and Smurf’s Village.

Although the games are initially free to download there are numerous in-game extras that can be bought in the form of jewels, coins or upgrades.

Mr Neale, an aerospace designer, said he was only alerted to the huge bill when he was prevented from withdrawing money from his bank.

He added that messages alerting him to iTunes purchases were going to his work email account - which he was unable to access as he was on deployment to another company.

The father contacted Apple to explain the mistake but was told 'all purchases made on the iTunes Store are final'.

He said: 'There are numerous games where Lily had been inadvertently making in-app purchases, but the major culprits were Campus Life, My Horse and Injustice, a super hero game.

'Almost as bad are Hay Day, Gymnastics Events and Smurfs’ Village. She just thought it was all free.

'It was not until I grilled her that she said she had been using a password that she had seen me put in when I had downloaded free games for her.

'She is only eight-years-old. Even when I sat her down and explained that what she was doing had cost dad money, I still don’t think she really understood.'

Apple was today unavailable for comment.

Customers who accidentally rack up huge bills on iTunes do not have an automatic right to a refund.

But Apple announced earlier this year that it will pay out £66million in compensation to parents in the U.S. whose children ran up massive bills using its free apps.

Youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents' credit cards.

Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families.

A number of software companies have developed games that are popular with children.

These 'bait apps' let you buy credit in order to progress through the game.

When children purchase 'currency', their parent's iTunes account gets automatically charged.

Apple started requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in March 2011.

But many parents around the world had already been hit by large and unexpected bills.

A
US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania 
who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. 
In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly 
addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency.

Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million).

The
case involves games such as Angry Birds, pictured above, Zombie Takeover, Playmobil 
Pirates, and Racing Penguin, some of which are offered as free downloads
on tablets such as Apple's iPad.

But the company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the UK and any refunds are currently given on a case-by-case basis.

The Restrictions menu in Apple's iOS software lets you control in-app purchases, and can even be used to stop children downloading apps entirely.

Parents can set a password for in-app purchases or turn them off altogether.

It's also possible to prevent apps being deleted or installed and control access to age-restricted content.

To prevent in-app purchases in iOS, open 'Settings' then choose 'General' and 'Restrictions'.

Then tap 'Enable Restrictions', choose a PIN and enter it a second time to confirm.

Now you can set restrictions from the menu below.

In the 'Allowed Content' menu, slide 'In app purchases' to 'Off' to stop children's ability to run up bills.
