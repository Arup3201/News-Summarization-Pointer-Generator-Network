Nigel Farage's former flatmate has branded the UKIP leader a 'salesman' claiming he is not not up to the job of leading the party and should step down to make way for someone younger.

Godfrey Bloom, a former UKIP MEP now sitting as an independent after losing the whip for hitting a journalist and calling women sluts, shared a flat with Mr Farage in Brussels for several years.

But on the eve of Mr Farage's second televised debate over Europe with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, he took a swipe at his former colleague saying UKIP needed to 'sharpen its game'.

Attack: Former UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom, right, has branded Nigel Farage a 'salesman' suggesting he should step down as party leader and make way for someone younger

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph Mr Bloom was asked if he believed Mr Farage was intelligent, to which he replied: 'In what way?'

And he suggested that Mr Farage was effectively standing in the way of many 'bright young people' who were waiting in the wings.

He said: 'Nigel has been doing it for 20 years: I think perhaps one might argue that's too long.'

In 2012 Mr Bloom made the headlines for outspoken comments about 
aid to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’ and women being ‘sluts’ for not doing the 
cleaning properly.

He was finally forced out of UKIP after he hit
 a TV journalist over the head with a conference programme in an angry 
on-camera clash.

Yesterday Mr Farage boasted how his party is harvesting thousands of votes from the BNP, with his anti-EU agenda and tough line on immigration was proving increasingly attractive to supporters of the far-Right party.

‘I would think that we have probably taken a third of the BNP vote directly from them.’ BNP candidates secured 940,000 votes in the European elections in 2009, but the party’s support has slumped since then.

Nick Clegg is expected to ramp up his attack on the Ukip leader after polls suggested the Deputy Prime Minister came off worst in the first clash last week, which included arguments over immigration figures and the number of laws coming out of Brussels.

A YouGov survey of 1,003 viewers found that 57 per cent thought the Ukip
 leader had performed better, with 36 per cent backing the Deputy Prime 
Minister.

Mr Farage was criticised over recent days after naming Russian president Vladimir Putin as the world leader he admires most.

Mr Clegg has already branded the comments 'grotesque' and 'extreme', and is almost certain to raise them during the discussion.

Farage has insisted he was merely expressing respect for Mr Putin's handling of the Syria crisis, not his political approach.

Ukip membership is said to have surged over 25,000 in the LBC radio hosted debate last Wednesday, and party strategists will be hoping he can raise their profile further.

Meanwhile, Mr Clegg is seeking to gain wider advantage by painting himself as a conviction politician - and the only genuine pro-European among the main three leaders.

He said he believed he could 'unsettle' Mr Farage who he described as 'touchy' and unable to cope with the pressure of real political debate.

A poster launched by the party ahead of the showdown on BBC2 this evening mocks David Cameron and Ed Miliband as 'missing in action', saying the Liberal Democrats are the only ones 'standing up for British jobs'.

Party president Tim Farron said: 'David Cameron and Ed Miliband have ducked these debates. Nick Clegg is the only political leader prepared to put his neck on the line and stand up for British jobs.
