Team news

Manchester City

Manchester City strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko are both fit for the Barclays Premier League visit of Stoke on Saturday.

There were reports Aguero may have suffered a training ground injury this week, but the club have dismissed them and the Argentinian continues to build his match-fitness. Dzeko has recovered from the blow to a thigh sustained against Liverpool on Monday.

Scoring non-starter: Despite failing to start a Premier League game this term, Sergio Aguero has already scored twice for Manchester City and is passed fit as the champions take on Stoke this Saturday

New £32million defender Eliaquim Mangala and loan midfielder Frank Lampard remain short of match-fitness while striker Alvaro Negredo (metatarsal) is out long term.

Provisional squad: Hart, Caballero, Zabaleta, Sagna, Kompany, Demichelis, Nastasic, Boyata, Clichy, Kolarov, Silva, Nasri, Milner, Navas, Toure, Fernandinho, Fernando, Aguero, Jovetic, Dzeko.

Stoke

On-loan Chelsea winger Victor Moses is likely to start on the bench at Manchester City on Saturday despite impressing on debut in midweek.

The Nigeria international featured significantly in the Capital One Cup victory over Portsmouth, but is not yet fit enough to play 90 minutes.

Pick me, boss: Victor Moses impressed mid-week but is unlikely to start at Manchester City

Utility player Geoff Cameron is out with a thigh problem sustained in the cup game, but defender Phil Bardsley and Bojan Krkic could be fit after being rested in midweek.

Provisional squad: Begovic, Bardsley, Wilson, Shawcross, Pieters, Sidwell, Whelan, Odemwingie, Arnautovic, Nzonzi, Biram Diouf, Sorensen, Wilkinson, Muniesa, Adam, Walters, Bojan, Crouch, Moses.
