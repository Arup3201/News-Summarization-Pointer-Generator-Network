Alex Corbisiero will be out of action until ‘early 2015’ with a shoulder ligament problem which will require surgery and a lengthy recovery period.

England’s premier No 1 will miss the autumn series against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia and may face a mad dash to prove he is ready for the RBS 6 Nations.

As he contemplates another prolonged injury lay-off, the 26-year-old Northampton prop must wonder whether he will ever escape the cyclical spectre of damage, surgery and rehab.

The England prop needs surgery and faces a long recovery period in yet another set-back to his career

Corbisiero will miss Tests against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia and maybe the 6 Nations

Leicester lock Geoff Parling has also been ruled out of the November matches but he has been available for long periods since emerging as a Test player, whereas the same cannot be said for Corbisiero.

It is a testament to his rare talent as an accomplished scrummager and mobile forward that New Yorker Corbisiero made it to Australia last summer and had a major hand in a Lions series triumph — starting and excelling in two Tests. His troublesome knees had so nearly denied him that honour, only for an injury to Ireland’s Cian Healy to open the door.

Sadly, Corbisiero has played just 19 of 40 possible internationals for England since making his Test debut in February, 2011. There has been a solitary appearance for his country in the past 22 months, as his knees have required frequent medical intervention.

Now, having missed the summer tour of New Zealand in order to ensure he tackled this season in peak condition, this latest harsh twist of fate consigns him to another long absence. 

While this is an unrelated issue - a different joint - the figures point to a persistent problem in terms of withstanding life at the sharp end of his brutal profession.

Corbisiero played nine times for Northampton last season, following his transfer from London Irish. In six full seasons in the Aviva Premiership he has started a mere 33 games - no more than six in any one season. When he left the Exiles, their director of rugby, Brian Smith, claimed his knee problems were ‘degenerative’.

Geoff Parling receives treatment during Leicester's game against Bath last week

Mike Brown (Harlequins, full back): Sore ribs. Return: this weekend.

Dan Cole (Leicester, prop): Neck surgery. Return: late November

Alex Corbisiero (Northampton, prop): Shoulder surgery. Return: ‘early 2015’.

Owen Farrell (Saracens, fly-half): Hamstring strain. Return: mid-October.

Geoff Parling (Leicester, lock): Persistent concussions. Return: December.

Ed Slater (Leicester, lock): Knee ligaments. Return: next season.

Manu Tuilagi (Leicester, centre): Groin injury. Return: weekend after next.

Mako Vunipola (Saracens, prop): Knee surgery. Return: November.

Anthony Watson (Bath, wing): Foot injury. Return: possibly Friday.

Tom Wood (Northampton, flanker): Back injury. Return: 1-2 weeks.

Tom Youngs (Leicester, hooker): Shoulder operation. Return: late December.

The player himself is well aware that Joe Marler has established himself as a pedigree Test performer and that Mako Vunipola, while also likely to miss the autumn matches, is another high-class alternative.

No wonder Corbisiero recently explained that his priority is simply to play, saying: ‘My main goal for this season is to stay healthy, stay fit, keep playing and build back my old form and keep improving. The knees feel good. My load is managed. I’m in as good a shape as I’ve ever been.’ 

Unfortunately, that positive state was shattered by a collision during Saturday’s home win over Bath. A statement issued by Northampton on Tuesday read: ‘Alex has sustained a ligament tear to his shoulder that will keep the England prop out of action until early 2015.

‘The specialist’s advice is that the tear needs surgical repair so that he can play to an optimum level in the future.’

Meanwhile, Leicester confirmed that Parling will take an enforced rest in an attempt to alleviate his recurring concussion problems. ‘He saw the relevant specialist this week and will have time out of the game now,’ said Richard Cockerill, the Tigers’ director of rugby. 

Manu Tuilagi (in action for England against New Zealand) is recovering from a groin injury

‘He’ll probably be another couple of months out - probably three or four weeks of complete down time and then he’ll be reintegrated into training. You’d like to think that by December he’ll be playing again. And there’s no doubt about that, he will play again.’

On a brighter note, Cockerill insisted that Manu Tuilagi’s groin injury is not serious, even though it will keep him out of Saturday’s trip to Gloucester.

‘He’s improving well but he’s not quite where he needs to be,’ he said. ‘We find that most of the Pacific Island boys heal quite slowly. Manu’s brothers were exactly the same. The Tuilagi gene is big, quick and nasty, but slow healers. When they’re fit they’re dangerous, but when they’re injured they slow down!’
