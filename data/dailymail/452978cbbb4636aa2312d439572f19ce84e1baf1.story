Comrades of missing sailor Timmy MacColl left a space on deck where he should have stood as their ship returned to port in the UK yesterday.

The 27-year-old father-of-two, originally from Killin, Scotland, vanished on a night out socialising when the ship was docked in Dubai more than 12 weeks ago.

Despite a large media campaign in the Emirate, there has not been an update on the case from Dubai police for weeks. It is feared he may have been kidnapped.

Touching tribute: A space is left on deck where missing Leading Seaman Timmy MacColl should have been standing as HMS Westminster returns to port in Southampton yesterday morning

There were tears yesterday as sailors lined the deck of HMS Westminster as it arrived at Portsmouth. In tribute to their missing comrade the ship's company left a space where he should have been standing.

On land, the family of Leading Seaman MacColl stood at the shoreline as the vessel made its way to dock at 10am, unfurling a banner that read, simply: 'Bring Timmy Home'.

Leading Seaman MacColl’s pregnant wife Rachael, 25, watched the ship arrive from the privacy of the dockyard. The return comes as an anonymous benefactor put up a 'substantial cash reward' for any information

Missing: Timothy MacColl, 27, from Gosport in Hampshire, with one of his two children. He vanished more than 12 weeks ago

Mrs MacColl - who married her husband 
seven years ago after they met at HMS Collingwood - hopes the reward 
will lead to a development in the case.

'The
reward will be paid if information given actually leads to Timmy being 
physically located,' she said. 'If someone knows something please come 
forward.

'My life can’t move
forward until I find him. It’s not just emotionally, it’s financially, 
my children, his family. Our family deserves answers. That’s the main 
thing, we just need to find him.'

Timmy went missing after being put into a taxi by two shipmates outside the Rock Bottom Cafe nightclub at 2am on May 27.

He had no ID and only a Nokia phone, which has never been found.

The cab was told to go back to Port Rashid where Westminster was docked, but the sailor never arrived.

The
driver has told Dubai police the sailor got out of the car when he got 
lost inside the port and pulled over to ask for directions.

Mrs
MacColl, who is expecting their third child in October, made a trip to 
Dubai and retraced her husband’s last-known steps last month.

She fears he has been kidnapped. Land and sea searches around Port Rashid failed to find any clues.

'We are told Timmy gets in the taxi, he gets out of the taxi at the tea shack and that’s it,' she said.

'We’ve
not been told how they know this information is true. And we’ve not 
been told about forensics on the vehicle or anything like that, so we 
don’t even know if it was Timmy in the taxi.

'It’s
assumed it was Timmy in the cab. It has been ascertained now that there
were other members of the ship’s company in Rock Bottom.

'They would have left at some point and got a taxi back. There’s nothing after he is seen on CCTV leaving the bar.

'The
description of his clothing given to the police by shipmates was wrong,
he was wearing blue and white checked shorts with a red T-shirt and 
dark-blue canvas shoes.'

Mixed emotions: Friends and relatives of Timmy lined the shoreline to 
release yellow balloons and unfurled a banner as the ship returned to its 
home port of Portsmouth, Hampshire

Difficult time: Timmy's friends and family hug as HMS Westminster returns to Portsmouth. They are calling on the British police to become involved in the search after hearing nothing from the Dubai police for weeks

Tearful crowds shouted 'Welcome home 
Westminster' as the ship passed yesterday and 50 yellow balloons were 
released in tribute to the missing sailor.

The Captain of HMS Westminster said he was 'desperately disappointed' to be returning home without Leading Seaman MacColl.

Mrs
MacColl's uncle Neil Cunningham - who flew out to Dubai to help with 
the search in June - joined her mother, aunt and grandfather yesterday 
at Portsmouth's Round Tower fort to watch the Westminster's arrival.

He said: 'Not knowing what happened to Timmy has been hard for Rachael but she has been amazingly strong and resilient.

'She has shown immense strength of character and will never give up searching for him.

'Outwardly
she displays such strong emotions. When she is with people she is fine -
she has the comfort and support of family and a good network of 
friends.

'But when she is alone with the children - particularly early in the morning - things are more difficult.

'We will go on searching for Timmy forever.'

Family man: His wife Rachael, who is expecting their third child in
October, has vowed to find her husband

Mr
Cunningham, 42, added: 'We are also here to support the ship’s company 
who have gone through the same awful 77 days as us, missing a ship 
mate.'

Mrs MacColl’s 
grandfather Jim Cunningham said: 'It has been a very, very fraught time 
for us. We never realised it was going to continue for this long without
a positive outcome.

'I have
wanted Hampshire Constabulary to be involved in this case from the 
start. They have experience of dealing with other forces and a good 
track record with murder enquiries.'

Mrs MacColl’s mother Jacqui Brien also vowed to never give up hope.

But she said the couple’s son Cameron, seven, and daughter Skye, four, are struggling to understand what’s going on.

Cameron thinks his dad has been kidnapped - 'like in the film Pirates of the Caribbean'.

Mrs Brien, 46, added: 'Someone knows something. Whatever has happened we need to find Timmy or we’ll always be wondering.

'We have shed more tears this last week than any other - I think it was knowing the ship was coming back without Timmy.

'The closer my daughter gets to her due date the harder it gets. It is really hard for her. We feel empty and numb.'

Departed: Routine checks were carried out by the Navy before the HMS Westminster sailed, but they could not locate the leading seaman and local authorities were alerted

Concerning: The sailor, right, has not been seen since getting into a taxi at around 2am on May 27. It is known that he had just left the Rock Bottom Bar, left, which is at the Regent Hotel in the area of Deira

Neil
Cunningham said the family is struggling to gather information and 
added: 'I keep trying to get the Dubai police to speak to me but they 
won’t unless I’m out there in person.

'I’m
requesting information from the home secretary and speaking to the 
Royal Navy’s investigation branch, which is doing a sterling job in very
trying circumstances.'

The Royal Navy has continued to express its 'concern' for Timmy’s safety.

A
spokesman said: 'The matter is being treated as a missing person case. 
The MoD and Royal Navy continue to liaise with and provide assistance to
the Dubai authorities.

'The Foreign Office also remains in contact with the Emirati police about their ongoing investigation.'

Captain
Nick Hine, Leading Seaman MacColl's commanding officer, said: 'Clearly 
we are all desperately disappointed that Leading Seaman MacColl remains 
missing.

'Our thoughts and prayers remain with his family at this particularly difficult time.'
