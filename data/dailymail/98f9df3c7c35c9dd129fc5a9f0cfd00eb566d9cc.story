Michael Carrick has credited the return to form which has seen him recalled to the England squad down to the influence of Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal.

The midfielder, hailed by Sir Alex Ferguson last year as the best English player in the game, has won countless club trophies but struggled for consistency at international level throughout his career.

Now 33 years old, he is one of the oldest heads in Roy Hodgson’s squad and is a strong contender for a place at the bottom of the midfield diamond the England manager so often prefers to deploy.

Carrick had particular praise for the Manchester United manager's aura and straightforward nature

‘Van Gaal has improved me,’ Carrick said. ‘Certain situations in games, he's helped, not just individually but as a unit, as a defensive unit, as a group of players. I've definitely learnt from him.

‘He's been great from the start for me. I couldn't ask for any more from him in terms of what he's given me, and the support and confidence to be a big part of the team.

‘A lot of people at the top of their field, whether it's business or sport, tend to have that aura, and he's certainly got that belief and clarity in what he wants and what he expects from players.

'He's really straightforward and honest. ‘What you guys see when he speaks publicly, he's exactly the same with us. He's straight down the line and honest and says it exactly as it is.’

Carrick is still yearning to improve his game further, despite moving into the twilight of his career, and tries to learn from the very best in his role.

‘You can look at a few – Andrea Pirlo, Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets,’ he said. ‘Busquets probably doesn’t get enough credit for what he brings to Barcelona. There’re a few out there. ‘I thought Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta for Paris Saint-Germain against Chelsea were terrific, especially when they went down to 10 men. I like watching and still trying to learn from others.’

Carrick has also gained his footballing education alongside one of the midfield masters in Paul Scholes, and their former United team-mate and England coach Gary Neville compared the pair to ‘going into a bar and hearing a piano playing’ due to the calm they brought to the midfield together.

‘It made me laugh,’ Carrick said. ‘I can see Nev saying that, but it was quite nice in a way. Playing alongside Scholesy I learned so much. He’d take the ball anywhere, he’d put his foot on the ball and try to have influence on the game.

‘It is a lot about your personality, as a person, as a player, that is how I am really, quite quiet and understated, it suits me.’

In the absence of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, England’s midfield is crying out for an experienced head in the middle and Carrick, if he can stay injury free, is eyeing Euro 2016 as his tournament.

’That’s definitely what I’m striving towards,’ he added. ‘I’ d love to have another real crack at it. Trying to have a bigger influence in the team is the target.’
