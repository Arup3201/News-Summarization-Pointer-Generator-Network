Quitting: Embattled San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has reportedly agreed to leave office as part of an agreement made in court amid the multiple accusations of sexual harassment against him

Embattled San Diego Mayor Bob Filner will resign as part of a deal in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him and amid a chorus of fellow Democrats and a long line of women who say Filner mistreated them.

The mayor was seen leaving his office with packing boxes late Wednesday. He will formally leave his post following a city council session on Friday.

City Attorney Jan Goldsmith announced Filner had come to an agreement Wednesday evening after three days of mediation before a former federal judge.

Goldsmith’s announcement did not 
include specific details, however sources tell NBC San Diego that the 
mayor is indeed stepping down.

‘The
City Council has not heard of this proposal and our process at City 
Hall as well as the mediation process requires that we maintain the 
confidentiality of the proposal until they have heard of it,’ Goldsmith 
said.

Filner's attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.

The
sex scandal swirling around Filner has plunged the city into political 
turmoil. The public has seen only glimpses of the mayor for the past 
several weeks. Meanwhile, a recall effort has started and women continue
coming forward and saying Filner made unwanted advances and 
inappropriate statements to them.

Dianne
York, the latest of at least 17 accusers, said Filner placed his hand 
on her buttocks while she posed for a photo with him about three months 
ago. York told reporters at a news conference Wednesday in National City
that the incident took place after a meeting at his office. She said 
she reported it to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.

Filner, a 70-year-old former congressman who took office last December, has seen his political support crumble.

Accusers: At least 17 women have publicly accused Filner of behaving inappropriately toward them, including Dianne York (pictured) who announced Wednesday that Filner groped her why they posed for a photo several months ago

Going public: Dianne York speaks about her allegations against San Diego Mayor Bob Filner during a news conference Wednesday. York is among 17 women who publicly claimed the mayor harassed them

The entire City Council has called on him to resign, as have members of Congress, state legislators and other political leaders.

The
mayor's former communication's director, Irene McCormack Jackson, was 
the first woman to go public with harassment allegations and is the only
one to file a lawsuit against Filner and the city. She claimed the 
mayor asked her to work without panties, demanded kisses, told her he 
wanted to see her naked and dragged her in a headlock while whispering 
in her ear.

Victory? Irene McCormack Jackson (right) with attorney Gloria Allred. Jackson is one of Filner's former staffers innvolved in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the mayor that has culminated in his resignation

Michelle Tyler, a nurse, claims Filner made inappropriate advances on her while she was seeking help for a disabled Marine. Her complaint was among a chorus of accusations that have now unseated the mayor

Going public: Great-grandmother and senior citizen Peggy Shannon, who works in San Diego City Hall, alleges she was the victim of continuous inappropriate sexual advances by Mayor Bob Filner

Other 
accusers include a university dean and a retired Navy rear admiral. Some
contend he cornered, groped and forcibly kissed them.

Success? Greg Timms signs a petition to recall San Diego Mayor Bob Filner Wednesday. Pressure from voters, the city council, and his accusers caused Filner to finally resign effective Friday, say reports

McCormack's
attorney, Gloria Allred, declined to comment on the settlement 
agreement but scheduled a news conference for Thursday in Los Angeles. 
Filner's former fiance, Bronwyn Ingram, is expected to join her.

Ingram called off the wedding in June and said it was because Filner seemed unable to control his impulses toward women.

Filner
announced three weeks ago that he would undergo therapy after 
acknowledging he has disrespected and intimidated women. He has denied 
any sexual harassment.

Should
Filner resign, City Council President Todd Gloria would become acting 
mayor until a special election is held. Gloria and Councilman Kevin 
Faulconer were among those at the settlement talks.

Meantime,
the petition drive to recall Filner is in full swing, and calls from 
his own party urging him to step down were mounting with the Democratic 
National Committee planning to vote Friday on a resolution calling on 
him to quit.

Michael Pallamary, chair of the Recall Bob Filner campaign, urged recall supporters to continue working.

‘The
effort to qualify a recall to remove Bob Filner from office will 
continue unabated in its strength of purpose and momentum until a 
resignation has been tendered by Filner and an election called by the 
City Council to replace him,’ he said in a statement.
