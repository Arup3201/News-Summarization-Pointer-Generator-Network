Peyton Manning's performance for the Denver Broncos in last night's championship win may have won him the admiration of sports fans in the city, but his pre-snap call of 'Omaha' has also charmed people in Nebraska.

So much so that an Omaha zoo has now named a baby penguin after the NFL star to say thank you for drawing attention to their city.

The fuzzy little Rockhopper penguin, who lives at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, has been named Peyton in honour of Manning, who threw 400 yards and two touchdowns in last night's game to take the Broncos to the Super Bowl for the first time in 15 years.

Peyton the penguin: This baby Rockhopper penguin at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquatic Centre has been named after NFL star Peyton Manning

Called it: The zoo came up with the name to thank Manning for drawing attention to their city with his pre-snap call of 'Omaha', which has attracted a lot of attention

Mysterious: The real-life Peyton has stayed quiet on the meaning of the call, saying it signifies different plays depending on the weather, direction of play and what jerseys the team are wearing

Dennis Pate, CEO of the zoo, said: 'We thought it would be a really cool way to thank Mr Manning for using the word Omaha in his pre-snap chants.

'We hope that Mr Manning and his family will consider coming to Nebraska to see his namesake some time in the near future.'

Manning has so far kept the meaning of the call a mystery, saying the play it signifies changes depending on the weather, direction of play and what jerseys the team are wearing.

The Broncos beat the New England Patriots 26-16 to secure Manning's third trip to the Super Bowl, of which he has won one.

Thank you: Dennis Pate, CEO of the zoo, said the idea was a cool way of thanking Manning for drawing attention to Omaha and hopes he will visit his namesake at the zoo

Star: Manning threw 400 yards and two touchdowns in last night's championship game to take the Broncos to their first Super Bowl in 15 years

Victorios: If the Broncos win then Manning will become the first quarterback to claim the title with two different teams. He won it in 2006 while playing for the Indianapolis Colts

They will face the Seattle Seahawks after they beat the San Fransisco 49ers 23-17 thanks to a fourth quarter touchdown pass by Russell Wilson and some tenacious last-minute defending.Â 

After the victory, Manning said: 'Being in my 16th season, going to my third Super Bowl, I know how hard it is to get there,' Manning said after the game.

Manning will try to become the first quarterback to win the Super Bowl with two different teams, at the Meadowlands on Feb. 2 against Seattle. He won the title in the 2006 season while paying for the Indianapolis Colts.

The game will be played in New Jersey at MetLife Stadium, where Eli Manning's New York Giants play their home games.
