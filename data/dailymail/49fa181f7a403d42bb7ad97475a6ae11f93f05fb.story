With the Duchess of Cambridge, Sophie Wessex, Zara Phillips and countless society girls wearing her designs, milliner Jane Taylor is already well-known in certain circles.

The British milliner hit the headlines during the Jubilee celebrations when the Duchess of Cambridge chose to wear a £700 beaded cocktail hat from the brand and the Countess of Wessex chose a blue Jane Taylor design to complement her silk suit.

But now the high society hat maker is 
set to expand her customer base as she launches a website selling 
designs that can be afforded by more than just princesses and blue 
bloods.

Jane Taylor has just launched a new website with prices starting at £150 - just in time for Royal Ascot in June

The brand, based in Fulham, south west London, is celebrating its fifth birthday with a global expansion project to meet the growth in demand fuelled by customers wanting to emulate the likes of Kate.

'The new website makes the shopping experience a lot more hassle-free for the consumer and allows them to view the pieces online,' said Jane.

'Our audience has expanded globally 
over the last couple of years, and the new website makes it a lot easier
for our international clients as well.'

'We’ve had a promising year dressing a variety of high-profile clients, and our clientele is constantly expanding,' she said.

Last summer season the label dressed the Duchess of Cambridge, Zara Phillips, Sophie Countess of Wessex 
and Princess Eugenie for a variety of events.

'I have faced a number of 
challenges with the expansion of the business - namely there not being 
enough hours in a day,' she goes on. 'We are very busy at the moment, especially with 
the run up to Ascot.'

The online collection will include bridal and bespoke designs as well as glamorous, bejewelled pieces and ready-to-wear hats.

For those looking to mark a special occasion there are intricate styles costing up to £1,700 alongside more affordable off-the-peg designs.

'We have expanded our range of 
stockists to include Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Fortnum and Mason, 
Fenwicks, and House of Fraser, who are also carrying our Taylor 
diffusion range,' said Jane.

'Our
AW14 collection has been previewed and reviewed very well by the stores
which is always great. The focus has been based on using a sustainable 
and ecological new fabric as inspiration.'

'The brand is also expanding to 
include international wholesale, and we’re currently speaking to a 
number of overseas retailers to include our collection, which is of 
course very exciting.'

Jane says that her proudest moment to 
date has been seeing the Duchess of Cambridge wearing her hats during 
the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

The website, she says, is an 'exciting 
opportunity' for the public to get their own piece of royal style.

'We have a number of collaborations and special projects on the way too - watch this space.'

Zara Phillips wore a grey felted wool hat decorated with handmade bloom to Cheltenham Festival last month while Florence Brudenell-Bruce opted for a Missoni dress, cut out heels and a Jane Taylor hat at Ascot 2012

'The fascinator is dead and I’m delighted,' Treacy told the Sunday Times.

The milliner to the stars, whose clients include Madonna and Lady Gaga, added: 'The word fascinator sounds like a dodgy sex toy and what’s so fascinating about a fascinator?

'Mass production means that they became so cheap to produce that now they are no more than headbands with a feather stuck on with a glue gun. We’re seeing a return to proper hats.'

Jane Taylor

Jane Taylor launched her first bespoke range in 2008, selling to private clients and dressing women for the Henley Regatta and Ascot, quickly establishing herself as the go-to milliner.

Today Jane designs, handmakes and showcases her collections from her design studio  in Fulham.

Taylor has already designed for the Royal Family and guests at the Royal Wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as well as collaborating with leading British designers such as Caroline Charles and well-known figures in the TV & music industry. Both Rita Ora and Paloma Faith have worn Jane’s creations.

Jane's pieces are now regularly featured in all the leading fashion titles and stocked in major department stores. 

During a momentous 2010/11 –  Jane was introduced to the Queen & Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace for the British Clothing Industry reception and was described by James Sherwood (stylist to BBC’s Royal Ascot presenters) as ‘One of the most talented young British milliners - she's a real talent'.

Jane Taylor has also designed bespoke pieces for European Royalty such as the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, Princess Marie of the Netherlands, and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark. Guests at both the Royal Weddings of Zara Phillips & Mike Tyndall, and the Prince of Monaco wore Jane’s headpieces? and more recently The Countess of Wessex regular client and Zara Phillips were photographed wearing Jane Taylor at the races.

Jane’s proudest moment to date was seeing The Duchess of Cambridge wearing two of her hats during the Queens Diamond Jubilee celebrations, one to St. Paul's cathedral for the thanksgiving ceremony and the other when touring the Solomon Islands with The Duke of Cambridge.
