Being a fox, Roxy doesn't look quite right at the end of a lead.

But, remarkably, she is happy in her role as a family pet.

Whether its going for a walk, munching from a dog bowl or playing with toy bones, she's perfectly at ease with her canine chums.

And she'll happily walk around the shops with the big-hearted animal lover who took her in.

She has even been known to lounge around in the house, trying to show the household's pet dogs she is boss.

'Most spoilt fox in Britain': Roxy eats from a dog bowl. Her owner says he has put her in with chickens - and they just peck at her

Her owner, Geoff Grewcock, 61, says 
she won't eat raw meat and can even sit placidly in a chicken coop while
 the hens peck at her.

Roxy,
 a ten-year-old red fox, was taken in by Geoff who runs an animal rescue
 centre in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, after she was found tied to metal 
railings.

He intended to rehabilitate her into the wild, but quickly realised she was tame and didn't know how to hunt for herself.

It was then that he decided to look after her at his home, giving her a pen in the garden and introducing her to his pet dogs.

Top dog: Roxy - who once leapt into a pushchair and fell asleep - leaps at a dog as she goes for a walk

Britain's tamest fox? Roxy goes for a walk on a lead along with a dog. She was rescued by Geoff Grewcock, 61, after being found tied to some railings

Before he knew it, she was playing 
with the pooches and enjoying dog toys, as well as wanting to go out for
 walks with her new friends.

Geoff, a grandfather-of-one, said: 'She seems to get tamer and tamer.

'She has no hunting instinct at all - you can put her in with the chickens and she would just sit there while they peck her.

Fox thinks its a dog: Rosie Clinton, 19, takes Roxy for a walk at the sanctuary where she has been looked after in Nuneaton, Warwickshire

'She has cooked chicken for dinner because she doesn't like any raw meat.

'You can stroke her and people in Nuneaton love to make a fuss of her when they see her out walking.

'Once, she even jumped in a pushchair with a little two-year-old and curled up asleep - the little girls' mum knew her and didn't mind at all.

'I let her in the house sometimes but she causes havoc playing with the dogs so she has her own pen in the garden.

'She has dog toys in there and sometimes she teases the dogs by sticking her big rubber bone through the wire and snatching it back when they try to eat it.

'She's a great favourite around here - she must be the most spoilt fox in Britain.
