A graduate student who lost four limbs in a horrific flesh eating infection has revealed her state-of-the-art $200,000 prosthetic hands for the first time.

Aimee Copeland, 24, of Snellville, Georgia, was cut in her right leg in a zip-lining accident in April 2012. She fell from the line into the Tallapoosa River, where the wound became infected with necrotizing fasciitis which threatened to kill her.

Doctors were forced to amputate her left leg, right foot and both hands to keep her alive. 

New hands: Aimee Copeland, 24, revealed her $200,000 bionic hands for the first time today

State of the art: The hands allow Aimee to carry out everyday tasks like signing her name and chopping vegetables

Everyday activities: The 24-year-old said she was glad to be back to doing normal things like cooking and cleaning

But today was a happy one for the 
University of Georgia student, she showed off a major milestone in
her recovery - her prosthetic hands.

Appearing on the Today show she 
revealed what she is now able to do from signing her name to chopping 
vegetables and shaking hands.

The hands are already proving so effective that she feels she can do 'pretty much whatever she wants to'.

She first tried the Touch Bionics hands at the beginning of the week at the company's clinic and already she's able to lift and grip with both hands.

She filmed herself picking and eating a potato chip out of a bag which she said was the most satisfying activity so far.

Her prosthetist Robert Kistenberg, who
is co-director and prosthetics coordinator at Georgia Institute of 
Technology, is the expert behind the limbs.

Explaining them on the show, he said 
that they work off the electrical and chemical reaction created every 
time we flex or contract a muscle.

'That electrical signal is very, very 
slight,' he said. 'But our electrodes are sensitive enough to pick it up
through the skin.'

'She’s very smart and very adept,' 
Kistenberg said of Aimee. 'I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next month or two 
she’ll be able to use them without thinking about it.'

'There are things that she's done in 
two days, three days that it takes other people 6 months or a year to 
gain control over these devices.'

For Aimee her ambitions are simply to restore a bit of normality.

Cooking and cleaning: Aimee said everyday activities were the things she had missed most. She couldn't wait to use the hands on returning home

Hope: Aimee Copeland, the graduate student who had to have four limbs amputated after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria, has been given $200,000 prosthetic hands

'I'm really looking forward to 
cooking with these and to cleaning my house,' she said. "I’m 
sort of OCD, so it seems like a weird thing to want to do, but I really 
want to clean.'

'Sometimes I wake up and I’m just 
like, ‘Oh my God, is this my life? This is 
crazy!'

'I look at 
pictures of how I was before, and I feel almost disconnected from that 
person because my perspective now is so different than the point of view
of that girl.'

'And so, in a way, it almost feels 
like I died a year ago and I was reborn as someone different.'

Discussing using the hands for the first time, she said she was hopeful it would develop naturally.

'It's almost like a muscle memory with
these things. 'You know, it's like you got to find the 
sweet spot and be able to pick things up naturally. And that'll come 
with time.'

She is currently finishing her master’s degree in psychology and then plans to start a program in social work.

The hands would normally cost 
$100,000 each but the company who produces them have hired Aimee as a 
spokeswoman so are providing them free of charge. 

Support: Prosthetist Robert Kistenberg is impressed by how well Aimee has adapted to having the hands

Electrical impulse: The hands react to the chemical and electrical signals made when muscles are moved

She is also due to have a prosthetic leg fitted later this year.

The wound on Aimee's leg initially received 22 stitches and ran up to her thigh.

However, she quickly suffered problems returning to the emergency room as it was clear the wound wouldn't heal and her leg turned a dark purple color.

As soon as doctors realized what the infection was they amputated her leg.

'I wasn’t able to walk,' she told show host Katie Couric. 'I wasn’t able to speak. The only thing I was able to babble was, ‘I think I’m dying'.’

It was then her hands and foot turned back and doctors had to amputate them too.

Speaking on her recovery earlier this month, Aimee said she wanted to spread a message of hope.

'I'm
doing great, and regardless of what happens to you, regardless of the 
circumstances in your life- there's always so much joy out there and 
you've just gotta find it,' she said.
