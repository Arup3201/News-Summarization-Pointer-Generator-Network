A Toronto-based artist is bringing new life to thrift store art by painting unexpected images and pop culture icons onto the previously discarded canvases.

David Irvine trawls thrift shops, yard sales and even street curbs for unwanted paintings and prints that he can transform into innovative works of art as a part of his Re-Directed series.

'It's been a popular series, because of the upcycling and humor and all that,' he told The Guardian. 'I think a lot of people can relate to the themes and pop culture.'

Mr. Irvine, who features his work on his website The Gnarled Branch, has started selling the original pieces from the series on Etsy as the demand for his work continues to grow.

While the Re-Directed originals cost $250 or more, prints of his work are available at Redbubble and Society6 for approximately $25.

Over the course of five years, Mr Irvine has revived hundreds of paintings and prints by incorporating animated images into the scenery. 

'Usually it's a vision that comes to me almost immediately,' he said, 'Whether it's a flying saucer or a piece of steak.'

The artist explained that he makes an effort match the style of the original painting when adding to the piece.

'I try to use the same color palette and technique, so it doesn't look like it's just stuck on.'

While Mr Irvine adds his own special touches to each work of art, he notes on his website that he will never paint over the original artist's signature. 

The artist said that he enjoys using old salvaged prints as medium for his work because there is 'a certain nostalgia to them'.

'I really like the old-style frames,' he said. 'You just don't see these in department stores any more.'

For those who have a particular image or idea in their mind, Mr Irvine accepts commissions. He will also add images to customers' personal paintings as long as they live close enough to deliver the piece to him.

Mr Irvine, who has been creating art for over 25 years, was inspired to name his business The Gnarled Branch after he repaired and refinished a previously trashed wooden table in 2004. 

The positive response he had received from his family and friends encouraged him to branch out and move away from more traditional forms of art.   

Mr Irvine also sells fine art, as well as painted ornaments, furniture, boxes, pins and magnets on his website.
