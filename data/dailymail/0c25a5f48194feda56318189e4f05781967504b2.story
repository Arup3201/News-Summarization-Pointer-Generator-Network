Israeli rabbis have given approval to the creation of a series of high-rise cemeteries to alleviate the country's grave yard crasis. 

Architects proposed that multi-story 'artificial caves' would stay within the spirit of Jewish law while also allowing them to maximise space in such a densely populated country.

The Yarkon Cemetery on the outskirts of Tel Aviv is the main burial ground in the city with 110,000 graves situated in its 150 acres. But under the new plan, 30 multi-storey 'caves' will provide an additional 250,000 graves which should be sufficient for a further 25 years. 

The Yarkon Cemetery in Tel Aviv is the first to develop a multi-storey burial ground to cope with Israel's grave capacity crisis 

The new building is one of 30 planned for the cemetery and should provide enough capacity to last a further 25 years 

The Israeli government has implemented new rules restricting the purchase of new traditional outdoor graves 

Initially ultra-orthodox Jews were sceptical about the project but eventually declared the practice kosher and in accordance with their burial practices.  

Yaakov Ruza, the rabbi of the Tel Aviv burial society, a semiofficial organisation that oversees Jewish burials, said the new forms of burial have been endorsed by leading Jewish ultra-Orthodox figures.

The towers, for instance, have pipes filled with dirt inside their columns so that each layer is still connected to the ground. In many ways, Ruza said the new types of burial represent a return to the Holy Land's ancient origins of burying inside caves and catacombs.

He said: 'This is an artificial cave. Once they used to build a cave into a mountain. Now we are taking these artificial caves and turning them into a mountain.'

Architect Tuvia Sagiv said: 'The source of all this is that there is simply no room. It's unreasonable that we will live one on top of the other in tall apartment buildings and then die in villas. If we have already agreed to live one on top of the other, then we can die one on top of the other.'

Sagiv said the Yarkon Cemetery has been his flagship project and has completed the first of the 70-foot-high buildings. 

He said: 'It takes some getting used to, but it just makes the most sense.'

The first of the buildings has not yet been completed. 

The Israeli plan is not unique as there are already vertical cemeteries in Brazil, pictured, Japan and China due to overcrowding

The Brazilian solution, pictured features a series of over-ground crypts where families can visit the space where their loved one is held

Cemetery overcrowding presents a challenge the world over, particularly in cramped cities and among religions that forbid or discourage cremation. The reality of relying on finite land resources to cope with the endless stream of the dying has brought about creative solutions.

The world's tallest existing cemetery is the 32-story high Memorial Necropole Ecumenica in Santos, Brazil. In Tokyo, the Kouanji is a six-story Buddhist temple where visitors can use a swipe card to have the remains of their loved ones brought to them from vaults on a conveyer belt system.

Versions of stacked cemeteries already exist in some shape or form in places like New Orleans and across Europe, in Egypt's Mountain of the Dead, in China and in the amphitheater-like Pok Fu Lam Rd Cemetery in Hong Kong.

But the future will likely look more like the ambitious plan of Norwegian designer Martin McSherry for an airy cemetery skyscraper that looks almost like a gigantic honeycomb with triangular caverns.

Other plans for cemetery towers have been presented for Paris and Mumbai. In Mexico City, another big project has been proposed: the Tower for the Dead, which will combine a vertical necropolis and an 820-foot-deep subterranean complex. 

Many cities have severe problems with overcrowded cemeteries such as the Montmarte graveyard in Paris 

In Lebanon, the Bashoura cemetery for Sunni Muslims is packed to capacity in the city of more than one million people 

Under Jewish law, cremation is prohibited so burial space is at a premium such as in the Washington Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York

The Washington Cemetery dates back to the late 1800s and is predominately used by New York's Jewish community 

In China, Beijing residents have been provided subsidies to buy space in vertical cemeteries.

The world's tallest existing cemetery is the 32-story high Memorial Necropole Ecumenica in Santos, Brazil. In Tokyo, the Kouanji is a six-story Buddhist temple where visitors can use a swipe card to have the remains of their loved ones brought to them from vaults on a conveyer belt system. 

But only in Israel does the phenomenon appear to be part of a government-backed master plan. Aside from those who have already purchased their future plots, individual outdoor graves are no longer offered to the families of the more than 35,000 Israelis who die each year.

The first space-saving option is to put graves on top of each other - separated by a concrete divider - and have a shared headstone. This is common among couples and even whole families, and every new pit dug in Israel has room for at least two graves in it. 

The second option is stacking the dead above ground into niches built into walls, a bit like in a morgue, but adorned with headstones. The third, and most revolutionary option, is to be buried in a building where each floor resembles a traditional cemetery, without the blue sky above.

For this upheaval to take off in Israel, though, the blessing of the rabbis was needed. Israel's rabbinical authorities oversee all burials of Jewish Israelis.

The Jewish burial ritual is based on the passage in Genesis in which God banishes Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden: 'For dust you are - and to dust you shall return.' Jewish law stipulates that all bodies be buried separately on a layer of dust and earth. 

Jerusalem's burial society even has plans to dig an actual underground cave to find more room for the dead.

In the Nueva Esperanza cemetery in Lima, Peru, locals have built their own version of the high-rise grave to maximise available space

In the City of the Dead region of Cairo, Egypt, more than half-a-million people live in the spaces between the tombs 

Japan is another country facing a grave capacity crisis which has led to a high-tech solution in Tokyo with one cemetery using a conveyor belt system where relatives can order their ancestor to be delivered from the vaults automatically 

Proponents say the new system is more sustainable, environmentally friendly and user friendly - providing a more comfortable visiting experience.

But resistance has emerged from a public wary of change. In one famous case, a bereaved family threatened a cemetery official that if their loved one was put in a wall they'd put the official in a wall too.

Shmuel Slavin, a former director-general of Israel's Finance Ministry who put together a report on the country's burial crisis, said there is no reason for such an emotionally fraught overhaul of an ancient tradition. He believes there is enough space in outlying areas, such as the vast Negev Desert in southern Israel, to build new cemeteries.

He said technological advances could allow more burials in existing cemeteries, and that the new 'dead cities' will be expensive to build and maintain.

But the bottom line, he said, was that people just don't want to be buried that way. 'People don't want to hear about it,' he said. 'There is a matter of tradition here. People want to be buried like their parents.'

Officials say that those who insist on traditional burial will still have that option; they'll just have to drive a little further and pay for it. Cemeteries, they say, are not designed for the dead but rather for the living who want to visit them. The hope is that by attending funerals, people will be exposed to the new system and learn to appreciate its upside.

Either way, burial officials say a growing number of people understand that change is inevitable.

Chananya Shahor, manager of the Jerusalem burial society.'We are all in favor of burying in the open field so long as it does not infringe on our lives. So if there is no more room to build homes in Jerusalem, I prefer burying in layers. God gave us land for living, not for dying.' 

The National Cemetery in Port-au-Prince, Haiti is oneof the most severely overcrowded in the world

In New Orleans, pictured, most graves in the city are above ground because of the high water table. As soon as a grave is dug in the city it is soon filled with water and if a traditional grave is not reinforced by concrete the body can be pushed above ground
