The heartbroken parents of a beautiful four-week-old baby boy who died due to complications arising from whooping cough have been forced to defend themselves from online trolls.

After urging other parents to get themselves and their children immunised against the deadly disease, Greg and Catherine Hughes have been inundated by messages from strangers - but not all of them have been kind.

‘To all the strangers sending me Facebook messages and asking why my son wasn't vaccinated. He was 4 weeks old!!! Too young to be vaccinated!,’ mother Catherine wrote on Facebook.

‘Go learn something about immunisation and stop bothering me. Our whole family was vaccinated but we live in the state with the worst vaccine rates and sometimes family vaccination just isn't enough to protect our babies,’ she added.

Riley Hughes died at just 32 days old after suffering complications arising from whooping cough

Riley's parents Greg and Catherine Hughes have been inundated by messages from strangers 

In the comments section of a Daily Telegraph article online a man named Rich also asked ‘if the mother of baby Riley was immunised and breast feeding?'

'This is one of the simplest ways to protect a child too young to be vaccinated,' he said.

‘Thank you for questioning me. I was fortunate to breastfeed my daughter for two years and my son Riley for the four weeks of his little life until he had to use a feeding tube in hospital, where I then expressed milk,’ Catherine responded.

‘I was also vaccinated as a child and received the booster shot three years before his birth, and was told my medical professionals this was sufficient. - Riley’s Mum.’

The couple, from Perth, who set up a Facebook page to honour their son Riley Hughes after he ‘passed away peacefully in the arms of his mummy and daddy’ at 2pm on March 17, aged just 32 days, publicly spoke about their son’s death in the hope it would help prevent more children dying from the preventable disease.

Riley’s father Greg posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’

Two days before Riley died his mother posted a photo of him wrapped in a blanket in hospital 

‘Our greatest desire out of our own personal tragedy is to stop parents from having to endure the heartache of preventable childhood deaths,’ Riley’s dad Greg wrote on the Facebook page Light for Riley.

Catherine Hughes has stood up to people who questioned her online

The newborn, born on February 13, died in Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital as a result of pneumonia-based complications arising from whooping cough. 

The brave family have now raised an incredible $36,000 for the Princess Margaret Hospital Foundation after setting up a fundraising page in honour of baby Riley.

Greg Hughes wrote: ‘It was with a mixture of tears and joy that I logged on early this morning to see that we'd surpassed our initial goal of $32,000! The last few days have been unbelievably difficult for my family, but this incredible show of humanity has kept us occupied and given us a drive to change the world.’

Updating the more than 50,000 who now follow the Light for Riley Facebook page, Greg said ‘We're hearing that across Australia many Medical Practitioners, Pharmacies and Suppliers are completely out of the vaccine.

‘We've seen change in WA and NSW with whispers that other states are hopefully set to follow suit. None of this could have been achieved without the phenomenal response from the people on this page. The support has been worldwide and humbling to say the least.

‘Thank you so much for your continued support, please continue driving the message and donating to this worthwhile cause. We're just getting started.’ 

Two days before his death, his mother Catherine posted a devastating photo of her son wrapped up in a blanket in his hospital bed urging people to get themselves and their children immunised against whooping cough.

Riley's father Greg appeared on Sunrise on Monday morning to thank the community for their fundraising and support 

‘If you haven't been immunised against whooping cough (pertussis) please consider getting it done. Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle with it at PMH please keep him in your thoughts!,’ she wrote.

'If you're anti-immunisation/anti-logic/anti-duty of care to your society as a whole, then feel free to take a look at this picture of my son in hospital right now at 4 weeks old with whooping cough - and then come and tell me how you think immunisation is a bad thing,' Greg added.

On March 17 Catherine then posted the tragic news that Riley had died.

‘We are devastated to let everyone know our gorgeous sweet month-old son Riley John Hughes lost his battle with whooping cough at Princess Margaret Hospital earlier today,’ she wrote.

‘He passed away peacefully in our arms after a tough fight. The staff at PMH were amazing and did everything they could to save his little life but the whooping cough was too severe. RIP Riley. Forever in our hearts.’

His mother Catherine Hughes posted a brave tribute to her baby boy and thanked Perth's Princess Margaret Hospital for doing 'everything they could to save his little life' 

'Heartbreaking to watch 4 week old Riley struggle,' Catherine Hughes wrote as she urged people to get themselves immunised 

Riley’s father Greg also posted a touching tribute on Facebook to his ‘darling little angel Riley’.

Greg wrote that Riley was ‘cruelly cut down before his life had an opportunity to start’.

‘I'm an absolute shell of a man without my baby boy and I'm truly not sure how I'll cope,’ he said as he honoured ‘the short but enormous legacy this little man has left behind’.

The Facebook page Greg and Catherine have set up already has over 25,000 likes.  

Greg wrote that the family’s long-term goal is to ‘be the drivers of change within this country surrounding the treatment, management and long term eradication of this horrific disease. We invite you to share this page with anyone and everyone.’ 

Catherine told Mamamia that her whole family is immunised and that they had also asked their friends and families to have boosters.

The Department of Health says it does not know how the child contracted the respiratory disease, also known as pertussis.

Whooping cough is part of the routine vaccination schedule for babies at two months, four months and six months of age. Booster doses are given at 4 years and 10-15 years.

Infectious Diseases Expert at ANU Medical School Canberra, Sanjaya Senanayake, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From my point of view immunisation is wonderful particularly for whooping cough.'

Whooping cough (also known as ‘pertussis’) is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. 

The government health website says the disease is 'highly infectious and most serious in babies under the age of 12 months'.

Babies are at greatest risk of infection until they can have at least two doses of the vaccine (minimum 4 months old) as the mother’s antibodies do not provide reliable protection.

It’s very rare for children who have been immunised against whooping cough to get the disease – and if they do, it’s usually not as serious.

Symptoms  

The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive ‘whooping’ noise, which is how the condition gets its name.

The early symptoms of whooping cough are often similar to those of a common cold and may include:

These early symptoms of whooping cough can last for one to two weeks, before becoming more severe. 

The second stage of whooping cough is often called the paroxysmal stage and is characterised by intense bouts of coughing. Each bout of coughing usually lasts between one and two minutes.

Infants younger than six months may not make the ‘whoop’ sound after coughing, but they may start gagging or gasping, and may temporarily stop breathing.

He explained infants are 'at a high risk of dying if they get infected' and that the death rate from whooping cough in infants under 6 months of age is about 1 per cent.

'It's important to listen to the experts,' Mr Senanayake said. 'Whooping cough is lethal in babies and in adults people can be absent from work for the persistent cough, it's a nasty infection.'

According to the department's notifiable disease report, there have been 244 cases of whooping cough in WA in the year to date, compared to 292 cases for the corresponding period last year and 232 cases in the first 10 weeks of 2013.

Data recorded on immunisation rates across Australia on the Department of Health's website shows, in 2012, WA had the lowest vaccination rates for whooping cough and for immunisation overall.

In WA 91 per cent of children were immunised against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis by 12 months of age and 90.2 per cent were fully immunised. 

In 2013, the Department of Health report said that despite a long-standing immunisation program, 'pertussis remains highly prevalent in Australia and the least well controlled of all vaccine-preventable diseases'. 

'Epidemics occur every 3 to 4 years. In unvaccinated populations, these outbreaks can be very large. In vaccinated populations, outbreaks are smaller, with greatly reduced mortality and morbidity, and may continue to occur every 3 to 4 years or be more widely spaced,' the report said.
