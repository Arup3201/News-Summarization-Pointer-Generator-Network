The Duke of Edinburgh proved he's back on his feet after his recent health scare by looking happy and relaxed as he undertook a solo engagement in East London today. 

Prince Philip visited the Royal Victoria Dock in Newham to  inaugurate the world's oldest complete steamship, the SS Robin.

The ship has been restored with the help of lottery funding and will now have a permanent home in the capital. The cause is close to the Prince's heart as he has been campaigning for decades to save the ship for the nation.

Back to his old self: The Duke of Edinburgh smiled and waved as he arrived in East London today and chatted to staff who have worked on the SS Robin

Preserved: The Prince is given a tour of the world's oldest complete steamship that he campaigned to save for the nation

In the Seventies the ship, that was built in Britain 1890, was due to be scraped after working as a trade ship in the Atlantic ocean for the British and then Spanish for nearly a century. It survived the First and Second World Wars not to mention numerous treacherous sea voyages.

The ship was bought back from the Spanish by the Maritime Trust in 1974 and then returned to British shores, where campaigners, supported by Prince Philip, made it's preservation possible.

The Prince was given a tour of the newly restored ship today, before it will be opened to the public next year, and met staff who had made the £3m restoration possible.

All board: The prince had to cancel an engagement earlier this week but was feeling shipshape again today

Inauguration: The SS Robin now has a permanent home in Royal Victoria Dock, East London

David Kampfner, chief executive and co-founder of the SS Robin Trust, said: 'She's a true London icon, symbolising the spirit of engineering, innovation, technology and true grit which made - and continues to make - the East End great.

'In his speech the Duke was saying the vessel was very high tech when it was built. He described it as the 'jet plane of its day'.

'That resonates with him. People think of its history but it was very modern when it was built. He related it to the origin of modern shipping.'

Historic: A plaque was unveiled during the visit to mark the occasion

The Duke attended today's engagement 
without his wife the Queen, who yesterday took part in a ceremony to 
mark the 60th anniversary of her coronation.

His visit proved the 92-year-old is back to his old self after being taken ill earlier this week.

On
Monday, he cancelled an official engagement he was due to undertake 
with the Queen attending a gala reception for the Royal National 
Institute of Blind People at St James’s Palace.

He
was not taken to hospital but rested at Buckingham Palace before then 
being well enough to join the Queen at the coronation service at 
Westminster Abbey yesterday.

However, he then excused himself from the evening celebrations at Buckingham Palace.

His latest health scare comes after 
he was hospitalised last year with a bladder infection during the 
celebrations to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubliee.

Speaking
on Daybreak this morning, his grandson, Peter Phillips, said the public
should not be surprised if Prince Philip and the Queen give the 'odd 
engagement' a miss from now on due to their increasing age.

He confirmed his grandfather had recovered after feeling 'under the weather' earlier this week adding about him and his grandmother: 'You have got to remember his age, both of their ages, you know... what they do at their age - they do a lot more than most other pensioners of their equivalent age.

'So if occasionally there is the odd engagement cancelled, it shouldn't come as such a surprise, given the workload that they do have.'
