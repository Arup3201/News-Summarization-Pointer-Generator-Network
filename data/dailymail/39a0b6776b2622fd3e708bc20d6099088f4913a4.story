Festive: Nigella Lawson, pictured on one of her Christmas-themed television shows, did not prepare mince pies or Yule logs and 'only made a Christmas pudding once', the Grillo sisters claim

Nigella Lawson relied on caterers, hired a team to decorate her Christmas tree and never cooked festive foods such as mince pies, her former assistants have claimed.

Francesca and sister Elisabetta Grillo have said festivities in the chef's household were a far cry from the celebrations she portrays on screen.

The sisters make the extraordinary claims a week after they were cleared of a £695,000 credit card fraud against their former employers.

The Grillos say the chef only cooked a Christmas pudding once and they never saw her prepare mince pies or Yule logs.

They claim Nigella had a tree delivered and her team were asked to decorate it.

They added the chef occasionally hired caterers and, for the past few years, the family went to her husband's gallery for their meal on December 25.

Speaking to The Sun, Francesca Grillo, 35, said: 'I never saw her make a mince pie or a Yule log at home.

'Caterers sometimes came in to do the cooking, then in the last few years the family ate out.'

The sisters, who worked for the family between 2001 and 2012, said the atmosphere in the household was often tense and December was 'very stressful'.

The sisters added Nigella would wear tracksuits and 'an old granny dressing gown' while walking around the house.

Speaking with reporter Ryan Parry from The Sun, they added: 'Remember she was just a brand. Real life was different.'

Nigella herself does not claim to maintain a 'goddess' image behind closed doors

Speaking to Louise Gannon for the Mail On Sunday’s Event Magazine, she said: ‘I happen to be incredibly lucky because I’m in a position where I do a job I love and I’m asked to do something like this.

‘If I wasn’t working I’d be lying on a sofa in some awful clothes reading a book doing absolutely nothing. I wouldn’t even put a brush through my hair. I am actually intrinsically a terribly lazy person.'

Claims: The sisters say Nigella would hire in caterers, have a team decorate her Christmas tree and the family would eat their festive dinner at her former husband's gallery

Ready: The chef posted this picture of a large festive table on her Twitter profile last night

Preparations: Nigella also tweeted pictures of her gravy as well as updating her followers of her Christmas dinner preparations

Last night, Nigella tweeted a picture of a large table adored in a red table cloth with the words 'Now it feels like Christmas!'

She is thought to be hosting for 30 people this year.

A spokesman for Nigella said they were not commenting on the claims.

Last week, the Grillo sisters were cleared of fraud at Isleworth Crown Court.

Yesterday, Nigella's sister Dominic Lawson slammed any suggestion the TV chef had a bad character, saying he was 'full of admiration' while watching his sister in court.

'As I sat a few feet away from my sister during this ordeal, I was overwhelmed with admiration', he said.

During the sisters' trial, it was revealed that Saatchi did not like Nigella hosting dinner parties for her friends.

Extraordinary claims: Nigella's former assistants Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo arriving at Isleworth Crown Court during the case earlier this month

It is claimed the advertising tycoon didn’t like her friends, or the riotous kitchen suppers which she had been in the habit of throwing when she was married to John Diamond.

It has been reported the hosting ban was a cause of contention between the couple, and that eventually Nigella resented not being able to see her crowd.

Creature of habit: Saatchi owned 12 identical suits, which he wore everyday and made a series of bizarre demands, the sisters said yesterday

According to Nigella, Saatchi disliked them, calling them ‘Nigella’s coven’.

Saatchi is also renowned for his bizarre eating habits.

In 2008, he shed 5st in nine months by eating nothing but eggs, three for each meal, always hard-boiled or scrambled.

In
 the following years he shunned his wife’s food and only ever ate fish, steamed or grilled, with no oil.

Yesterday, some of Saatchi's more unusual living habits and requests were revealed by the Grillo sisters.

They said that Saatchi owned 12 identical £1,000 Paul Smith suits which he would wear every day teamed with a white shirt from Turnbull & Asser.

They said Saatchi would demand his two favourite drinks - cloudy lemonade and Starbucks Frappuccinos - were always in good supply at their £27million Chelsea mansion.

He even demanded the assistants buy 12 television controls so he would never be without a remote, they claim.

Nigella has said she is concentrating on work in order to move on from the past, 'extremely difficult', months.

Speaking to Event Magazine she said: ‘The past months have been extremely difficult but I am looking forward to getting back to work and to looking after my family.

'I will survive this and move forward. I just want to focus on my family life and work.’

Answering questions about her new TV show The Taste, a cross between The X Factor and The Voice, Ms Lawson, 53, admits: ‘I’m a woman obsessed with food . . . I have an instinctive urge to feed people.

‘No one, not even the man who comes to fix the boiler, can leave my house without something wrapped in tinfoil. I don’t fight that urge.’

Moving on: Miss Lawson, pictured arriving at the trial of her two former aides, has said she is focusing on family and work to move past the 'extremely difficult' past few months
