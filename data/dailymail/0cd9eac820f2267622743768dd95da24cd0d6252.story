With no more than an electric toothbrush and a dirty wall at his disposal graffiti artist Moose added a stunning new Christmas-themed attraction to London's South Bank.

Moose, whose real name is Paul Curtis, used a Philips Sonicare toothbrush to cleverly clean away the dull green gunk on the concrete wall and create a winter landscape with rolling snow-capped hills, trees and a cute cottage at its heart.

To say Moose, whose trademark style of work is to clean dirt off surfaces, made the most of the moss would be an understatement.

'I think it's amazing,' said a passer-by. 'It's really nice to have something that's created so simply with something that's every day. It's a lovely addition to the South Bank.' 

Moose was impressed with both the tool he'd been challenged to use and its surroundings. 

He said he was on a mission to brighten up the lives of the workers who were looking 'quite miserable' on their way to work, and was a sparkling success.

In a part of London where creativity is embraced and renowned landmarks are found at every turn - including the London Eye, Waterloo Bridge, Royal Festival Hall and the Thames - his handiwork was certainly not  out of place.

'The moss and everything is coming straight off, and leaving a white, fluffy surface,' Moose said during his creative process. 'What a great thing to do with your afternoon, it's quite surreal really.

'It's been great for me. I've really enjoyed doing it. Regardless what [the toothbrush] does for teeth, it's incredible what it's done for the wall.'
