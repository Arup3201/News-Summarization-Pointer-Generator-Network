Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber said Friday his fiancée will have no role in his administration for the rest of his fourth term after questions were raised about her consulting work.

Visibly nervous as he addressed reporters with a shaky voice, Kitzhaber said Cylvia Hayes would continue her consulting business but would not work for organizations that 'have anything to do with the state of Oregon.'

The Democratic governor has been on the defensive about Hays' work since newspapers first raised questions in October surrounding her consulting for organizations that want to influence the state.

'These issues have become such a distraction that I want to make it very, very clear that she will have no policy role and no political role in the administration during the remaining four years of my term,' Kitzhaber said at a news conference at a state office building in Portland.

Hayes played an active role in Kitzhaber's third term, attending meetings, communicating with state officials and helping him push for environmental and clean energy policies.

At the same time, she did consulting work for several organizations involved in similar policies.

He previously said her role would be re-evaluated but hadn't ruled out her continuing involvement in his administration.

Kitzhaber was forced to respond to new reports this week in state newspapers that Hayes was paid $118,000 over two years for a fellowship with a green energy group — money that may not have been reported on her taxes.

Kitzhaber said legitimate questions have been raised but he wouldn't address them.

'Cylvia and I file separate returns. I have not reviewed, did not prepare and cannot answer questions concerning her tax returns, and those questions need to be directed specifically to Cylvia,' Kitzhaber said.

As Kitzhaber dodged rapid-fire questions from a large contingent of media, Hayes was in Sweden on Friday visiting friends at her own expense, he said. She has been unavailable to comment on the tax issue.

She'll travel later to Berlin for meetings with an organization that promotes using happiness to evaluate the success of economies and public policies. 

The organization, funded by the German government, is paying for her trip. It also paid for Hayes' 2013 travel with Kitzhaber to study happiness indicators in Bhutan.

Kitzhaber repeatedly deflected questions about whether her work constituted a conflict of interest, saying the Oregon Government Ethics Commission will decide. 

At one point, he compared himself to Marshawn Lynch, the Seattle Seahawks running back who spent an entire Super Bowl press conference answering every question with the same response.

Kitzhaber insists that he and Hayes worked hard to draw a clear separation between her public and private duties and to properly declare conflicts where they existed.

'That was our intent, and the ethics commission will make a determination as to whether or not we were successful,' Kitzhaber said.

Asked whether he's been blinded by love, he said he does not believe he is. He said he still plans to marry Hayes, to whom he proposed last summer, and has no intention of resigning.

'I'm not going to consider resigning, of course not,' Kitzhaber said. 'I was elected by the people of this state to do a job and I'm going to do it.'

Hayes has been under intense scrutiny over her business and embarrassing revelations of her past personal life.

Last fall, following a newspaper report, she acknowledged that in the 1990s she illegally married an Ethiopian immigrant so he could seek residency in the United States, and that she had never told Kitzhaber about the sham marriage that ended with the filing of divorce papers in 2001.

The controversy comes as Kitzhaber gears up for the five-month legislative session during which he's pushing an ambitious agenda on education and climate change, a priority for Hayes.

Hayes admitted in an email to the East Oregonian that she had been paid the money by CEDC. 

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from CEDC on Friday.  

The paper also confirmed that she did not disclose $88,000 in tax filings for 2012 - claiming her income  was just over $27,000 from her own business venture, 3E Strategies.

The paper reported that since Kitzhaber was sworn in as governor in 2011, his fiancée has pulled in around $213,000 in consulting fees.    

According to her first lady biography on Oregon.gov, Hayes has 22 years of experience working in clean energy and has served as a member and co-chair of the Oregon Renewable Energy Working Group.

Her own consulting firm, 3E Strategies, had led to an ethics investigation, following complaints.

In November, the Oregon Government Ethics Commission opened a preliminary investigation into Hayes' consulting work.

The commission received three complaints about Hayes' work as a private consultant.  

The preliminary investigation was to determine whether the commission should proceed with a full-fledged inquiry that could lead to sanctions.

The commission also rejected Kitzhaber's request for an advisory opinion about whether ethics laws apply to Hayes, whom he first met in 2002.  

Officials said the questions asked by the governor's office will be addressed in the investigation.

Kitzhaber said Hayes carefully avoided conflicts of interest. Among those who filed ethics complaints were the Republican state party and a Republican state representative. 

A decision will be made on March 13 on whether a full investigation will take place.
