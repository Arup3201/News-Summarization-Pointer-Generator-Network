The nephew of John Travolta has come forward in a new interview to describe his decision to leave the Church of Scientology, and what his life has been like since. 

Sam Travolta Jr. says he decided to leave Scientology in 2007 after almost taking his own life, and has now been forced to live on the run.

'It's psychological warfare and after a while it gets to you,' he said of being a member of the polarizing religion.

'Things got so bad that I tried to jump off a bridge in Los Angeles in 2007, trying to kill myself.'

He spent 28 days in a mental institution following this incident, and that is when he finally left the church.

Sam Travolta Jr. says he decided to leave the Church of Scientology (above) after he tried to take his own life, at which point members began mouthing to hi, 'You are dead'

Speaking with The National Enquirer, Sam did however say that his famous uncle did everything he could to help him, but even he could not stop the attacks that were waged against him after his decision to leave.

'Planting drugs on me' and 'spreading rumors around town that I was psychotic, and even worse - a pedophile,' are just two of the ways Sam claims members of the church tried to bring him down after his decision to leave Scientology. 

''My uncle told me, "Sorry, Sam, I can't help you. They don't care who I am."'

His uncle does however supply Sam with a monthly allowance, which is greatly appreciated by the struggling screenwriter.

Sam also says in the interview that Travolta has never pressured members of his family into joining Scientology, though he does say he would be 'friendlier' to those individuals who were members of the church. 

The other claim Sam makes against the church, and one that has been brought up frequently by former members, is the amount of work required of members for little to no pay.

Sam claims he worked as a file clerk, 'making $36 for a 60-hour week.'

Then, there was the treatment he received from other members shortly before he left the church.

Sam, claims they 'would mouth to me, "You are dead," over and over again. It was all about mental control for them.'

The 47-year-old says he has moved on now that the attacks have stopped, and he is finally trying to get his life back on track.

Sam's interview meanwhile could not come at a worse time for the church, with the HBO documentary Going Clear set to premiere later this month. 

The film takes a look at the religion, and how its treatment of A-list members like Tom Cruise and Travolta, differs from others in the church.

It is based on the book of the same name, which was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2013, and is based on interviews conducted with over 200 members of the religion who decided to leave the church.

John Travolta's lawyer has denied the claims made by his nephew in this interview.
