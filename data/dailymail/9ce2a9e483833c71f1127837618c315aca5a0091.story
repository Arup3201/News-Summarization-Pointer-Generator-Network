A father and his son have a ripper fishing tale for years to come that would make many a seaman green with envy.

Dave Lock was fishing with his father, Andrew, at one of their favourite fishing spots near Carnac Island off Fremantle - south of Perth at 9am on Wednesday when some unexpected drama interrupted the beautiful calm day.

Dave was filming his father, Andrew, who had just hooked a salmon and was about to reel in the fish, when a four-five metre great white shark appeared and all hell broke loose.

Dave Lock thought it was just another fishing trip until all hell broke loose

At first, the shark seemed disinterested and momentarily turns away

But then the predator reappears determined to snare the salmon which is moving nearer to the boat

The five-metre shark attempted to eat the fish, which jumped out of the way, but it missed its prey and crashed into the seven-metre boat instead.

The fierce impact saw both Dave, still filming, and his father hit the deck and the shark left its teeth marks behind on the side of the boat as a lasting memory.

'It touched my right knee with what must have been its nose or fin - that's how it close was,' he said. 

'It happened so quickly that I didn't have time to be scared.'

The 27-year-old said it wasn't until he watched the footage that he realised how surreal the moment was.

'Looking at it now I realise how insane it is - I thought "holy cr**",' he said.

'I was just taking a photo of dad and the shark photo-bombed,' he said. Then we drove away as it drifted off.'

Dave, who has been fishing for at least 20 years, said he had seen endless sharks in his time but not such a physical encounter.

'It just goes to show how powerful they are so I think it's important to educate people that they should not be messed around with,' he said.
