Earlier this month, Iran agreed to temporarily stop its nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions.

And that's good news for animal breeders in both countries looking to make more Iranian-American calves. 

Despite most trade with Iran being illegal, the U.S. sent nearly $2million dollars worth of bull semen to the Persian nation in 2012. In April 2013 alone, the U.S. sent $820,000 according to U.S. Census information gathered by Quartz.

Altogether the U.S. sent $45.7million in humanitarian aid to Iran last April. While the number seems like a lot, it's nothing compared to the $26.2billion sent to our biggest trading partner - Canada.

Bovine sperm side-steps the usual rules against trade between the two nations since it qualifies as humanitarian aid.

1. Rice - $18.6million

2. Lentils - $10.33million

3. Chickpeas - $7.02million

4. Chemical woodpulp -$3.3million

5. Butter - $1.9million

6. Vegetable seeds - $1.4million

7. Medical equipment - $1.1million

8. Bovine semen - $820,000

9. Dental equipment - $590,000

10. Fruit seeds - $250,000

11. Cattle - $110,000

12. Animal feed - $90,000

13. Veterinary vaccines - $60,000

14. Fertilizer - $40,000

15. Battery parts - $40,000

16. Nickel alloys - $30,000

17. Chemicals - $20,000

18. Others - $20,000

It's not the most exported item to Iran, but it's still in the top 10. Foods like rice, lentils, chickpeas and butter top the list.

In addition to sending food, the U.S. sends products to help Iran make their own, like vegetable and fruit seeds, fertilizer and animal feed.

The bovine semen is one part of that effort, helping to sire more cows as beef production has become an important issue in Iran. 

The country has made it a goal to be 
self-sufficient in all types of meat production by 2016, and they plan 
on investing the equivalent of $735million U.S. dollars into the 
industry over the next three years according to Global Meat News.

'Currently,
despite the great potential in the field of animal production and the 
creation of a number of agro-livestock farms, there are still many 
challenges in the industry, and some livestock enterprises operate only 
at 20 to 30 per cent of their production capacity,' said Cyrus Rusta, 
head of the Central Association of Animal Breeders.

They're
certainly not far off from self-sufficiency. In 2012, they produced 
970,000 tons of meat, which satisfied the demand for 90 per cent of the 
Iranian population.

But Iran isn't the only country after America's bull semen. 

The U.S. is the number one exporter of the product in the world, since many farmers want to breed high milk-yielding American cows.

American cows have become the most efficient milk producing bovines in the world - making 21,697 pounds of milk in 2012.

Of course this has to do with advances in agricultural technology, but its also due to breakthroughs in breeding.

American farmers have the ability to predict how much milk an offspring will make based on data fathered from the parents which helps in choosing which cows to mate with specific bulls.
