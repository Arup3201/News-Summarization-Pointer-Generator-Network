But it's not just all about the first Tuesday in November - the city develops a festival fever from the Friday night before and people arrive from all over the country to transcend into Cup craziness. 

No time for people to put their feet up - Derby Day is on the Saturday before, when 90,000-odd people don their Saturday best and make the trek to Flemington racecourse.

Sunday might not have a race on, but turn on a TV or radio or pick up a paper and it's wall-to-wall Cup coverage.

And Monday, with just 24 hours to go, tens of thousands of people lined Swanston St for the annual Melbourne Cup parade.

The event becomes a real who's who of the celebrity world as the rich and famous quaff expensive champagne and dine on fresh caviar, trendy burgers and bespoke desserts in the famous birdcage at Flemington.

Whispers have started that controversial couple, The Bachelor's Blake Garvey and Louise Pillidge, might make their first public appearance in the flesh. 

Celebrities will be on Rolling Stones alert at Lavazza, which is confirmed to be hosting Tyrone Woods, son of Ronnie Woods.

The Stones might drop by, given they are scheduled to perform at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne the following day.

There is talk Lara Bingle, rumoured to be pregnant to partner Sam Worthington, may swan into the birdcage to catch up with friend, fellow model Bambi Northwood-Blyth?  

Last Melbourne Cup Carnival, she broke the Victoria Racing Club dress code by flashing her midriff as she partied at the Lavazza marquee. 

Controversial businessman Geoffrey Edelsten, 71, is a regular Cup Day attendee, with his former wife Brynne Gordon always turning heads with her flamboyant racewear ensembles.

This year, Edelsten will take new fiancee, 25-year-old American DJ Gabi Grecko, to the Emirates marquee. 

Sunrise co-host Samantha Armytage will also join the party at Emirates, as well as the woman she replaced on the Seven Network's breakfast program, Melissa Doyle.

Rebecca Judd is also expected at Emirates with husband Chris Judd.

Model and new mum Megan Gale will join Ashley Hart in the Swisse marquee, where Lleyton Hewitt and his wife Bec are also on the guest list.

A conservative found the Melbourne Cup costs employers  $1.2 billion in lost productivity. Pictured are revellers at the end of Derby Day at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne on Saturday

Meanwhile, research by HR firm Randstad found that 77 percent of working Australians spend three and a half hours or more celebrating the Melbourne Cup.

The survey found that 15 percent watch the race and participate in office sweepstakes before getting back to work, and just 8 percent are too busy to watch the race at all.

The survey, taken in 2010 but adjusted to account for the Australian Bureau of Statistics' current size of the workforce and average hourly wage, found that a conservative estimate of the Melbourne Cups' cost to productivity  is $1.2 billion.

Taking into account costs associated with employees taking Monday off, particularly in Victoria where Melbourne Cup Tuesday is a public holiday, and the loss of productivity over much of  Wednesday, the number would be much higher, Randstad's Mike Roddy said.

Paul Dundon, managing director of workplace absence management firm Direct Health Solutions, said figures show the number of full-time employees who call in sick on the Wednesday following Melbourne Cup day jumps by 25 percent.

With just over 8 million full-time workers in Australia, for employers that means an extra 80,000 people don't go to work at a cost of $24 million, Mr Dundon said.

This is based on the absenteeism rate jumping from the daily average of 4 percent to 5 percent, and the cost of a sick day costing employers $300.

Mr Roddy said the majority of Australian workers expect to engage in Melbourne Cup festivities at work.

'From lunchtime onwards tomorrow you only have to look in any foyer of any workplace and fascinators will be filling the room with people going to lunches or getting on the bus to go to the races,' Mr Roddy said.

'There are various lunches and functions in the office and it's almost like a graveyard shift between two and five o'clock.'

But Mr Roddy said bosses should take advantage of the benefits of organising a Melbourne Cup event, as it could motivate employees to work longer or harder later down the track.

'If you weren't to allow people to celebrate you could be perceived as draconian,' he said.

'It's an opportunity to use this as a tool for having bit of fun and connecting with your people.'

The race also puts a drain on Australians' purse strings thanks to increase in people gambling, buying new outfits for Melbourne Cup functions and the jump in spending at pubs, clubs and restaurants around the country.

But this spike in spending injects millions into the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors of the economy, particularly in Victoria.

Almost 14 million Australians will spend $400 million betting on the Melbourne Cup tomorrow, or an average of $29 each, according to insurance firm Asteron Life.

Last year the Melbourne Cup Carnival injected $177.5 million into Victoria's gross state product

Last year IBISWorld estimated that Melbourne Cup boosts spending on food and alcohol by $167.9 million thanks to the number of events at workplaces, bars, clubs, restaurants and private homes.

And a study undertaken on behalf of Victoria Racing Club found that last year the Melbourne Cup Carnival injected $177.5 million into Victoria's gross state product.

More than 48,000 visitors travelled to Victoria specifically for Melbourne Cup, spending $25.6 million on accommodation.

Retail spending for the Cup hit $53.1 million in Victoria alone, with race enthusiasts buying more than 62,000 hats and fascinators, 60,000 pairs of shoes, 50,000 dresses, 30,000 items of jewellery, 27,000 ties, 21,000 handbags, 18,000 suits, 17,000 items of underwear, 14,000 shirts, 11,000 pairs of sunglasses and 13,000 pairs of socks and pantihose.
