One night last November, when we arrived home from school, Mummy and Daddy told us that they had heard strange sounds from the area behind our garage.

We put on our wellies and ran excitedly across the grass, past the chickens and the pond, to the back of the garden where Daddy parks his car.

Balancing on top of the builders' rubble and our old bikes was a pile of sparkly boxes.

He's the genuine article: Scott and Megan met the real Santa Claus at his snowy home at the top of the planet

There was a small one labelled 'Megan', a slightly bigger one labelled 'Scott', a bigger one still labelled 'Mummy', and the biggest one of all labelled 'Daddy'.

We tore off the silver ribbon and bows and opened the boxes. Each one contained a jumper with a picture on it. Megan and Daddy had a snowman, Scott had a Father Christmas and Mummy had a sparkly penguin.

In ours we also had a rolled up sheet of thick paper, tied with a red bow.

Daddy unrolled it and read what it said. Written in swirly hand writing, like we'd seen in old books, it said: 

Dear Megan and Scott

I hear from my robins that you have been very good this year.

I'd like you to come and meet me at the North Pole.

Your mummy and daddy can come too.

It's very cold, so I have asked my elves to send you some new jumpers to keep you warm.

See you soon!

Lots of Love, Santa x

For a moment we didn't quite understand. Then Mummy and Daddy explained. We had been written to by the Real Santa Claus, and he'd posted us the boxes and the letter from his home at the North Pole. We've both seen all the helpers who look like Santa that appear around town at Christmas. But this was the Real Santa, really inviting us to visit him in his real home at the real North Pole.

And he'd sent us new jumpers to keep us warm. We couldn't believe how lucky we were. Thank goodness we'd been good! A few weeks later Mummy and Daddy drove us to the airport in Bristol. Santa had sent a special plane to collect us and some other lucky children.

We were worried it would take a very long time, but by the time we'd watched a film and done some colouring we were there. When we arrived at the airport at the North Pole we had to collect our suitcases, but before they arrived we spotted two elves with pointy ears who had been hiding under the place where the bags go round.

Jumpers required for big adventures: Scott and Megan with mum Kirsty and TV presenter dad Martin Roberts

They were very naughty elves, because they kept tapping people on the back and then running away. It made us laugh a lot.

All around the airport it was snowy. There was a man dressed in funny clothes that Mummy said everyone would have worn here years ago. He had a pet reindeer. We gave it a carrot. It looked a bit like Sven from Frozen. In fact, everything looked frozen.

We got on a coach that took us to the place we were staying. On the way, some different elves made us sing silly songs.

After half an hour Mummy and Daddy said the songs were driving them mad. But we carried on singing. Our hotel was made from wood. The room was really big and had a TV. There was a kitchen where Mummy could cook our tea. The best thing was that the room had a balcony that was covered in snow that came up to our tummies.

There were lots of other wooden hotels all around, and a place we went to for our breakfast. There was even a supermarket. We didn't think they would have a supermarket at the North Pole - especially one that sold DVDs.

That night we went for a ride on special machines that could go through the snow. They were like the ones from Scott's Star Wars LEGO. Daddy drove one, and we snuggled under a blanket in another with Mummy. We went through the car park and out into the forest.

Eventually we arrived at a place where there was a bonfire and a man who gave us hot chocolate with marshmallows in it. The grown-ups said we had come to see the Northern Lights, but someone had switched them off. The next day we got on another coach and went to a secret place in the forest. There were loads of fun things to do, like sledging, rides on a sleigh pulled by real reindeer, and a funny show starring the elves.

But then we got into a special sledge that was pulled by an elf on a sort of motorbike for the snow.

A bit different to a sleigh ride: A snowmobile ride in search of the Northern Lights was also part of the holiday

We went down a path through the trees to a clearing where there was a little wooden house. Inside the house, sitting beside a roaring fire, was the Real Santa Claus. He looked the same as lots of other Santa Clauses we'd seen, but his tummy was even bigger and his beard even longer and whiter than anyone else's.

Somehow he knew our names, and he asked us what we wanted him to bring us on Christmas night. He said we could take a picture and gave us an early Christmas present.

On the way home we heard Mummy and Daddy say that it had cost a lot, and that the food 'left a bit to be desired'. We didn't understand what they meant. Santa had invited us to come for free. And as for the food - it was better than eating snow, and the hotel was at the North Pole, so the person cooking would have to find things to cook in the forest.

And anyway, on Christmas Day we got exactly what we had asked Santa for, so it was worth it.

I hope we get invited again this year, although Santa did say that there were a lot of children in the world that he wanted to invite, so it's OK if we don't as we've already had our turn.

And if any silly boys or girls at school say 'there's no such thing as Santa Claus', we will know they are fibbing, because we have met him.

Scott and Megan Roberts, aged 6 and 4, were 'invited' to visit Santa Claus

They visited Father Christmas at his home at the North Pole (well, Lapland)

Garish Christmas jumpers were required (well, it can be chilly that far north)
