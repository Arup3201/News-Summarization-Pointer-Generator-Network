A deadly Eastern Brown snake has been busted in a backyard after slithering its way into a beer can.

The venomous reptile, seemingly determined to sip on some poison rather than injecting it into others, was found in Mawson Lakes, north of Adelaide.

Lauren Lehman spotted the four-foot snake in her yard over the weekend, according to Nine News.

'I screamed, I cried, I felt sick, I didn't know what to do,' Ms Lehman said.

She said she immediately called in the experts, and Snakes Away's Ian Renton arrived to take the snake away.

'In the last 30 years that I've been in the industry I've probably only seen six to seven of these issues,' Mr Renton said.

Mr Renton's son, Corey, was filmed carrying out the delicate operation to free the trapped snake.

'I'm now going to try and cut his head free and hopefully I can do this without getting bitten,' he said in the video.

Eastern Brown snakes are found across Adelaide and the suburbs, with Mawson Lakes one of the most common places for snake catcher call-outs.
