British children are in need of personalised weight loss programmes to combat an obesity epidemic, a public health watchdog has warned.

The body said that advertising for unhealthy snacks and confectionary should be banned on children's television to help the UK's 1.3million obese children lose weight.

Public Health England also suggested that councils should be given the power to formulate health programmes to 'deal with this problem head on'.

The agency, which started operations yesterday, has a wide-ranging remit to 'protect and improve the nation's health and wellbeing'.

British children are in need of personalised weight loss programmes to combat an obesity epidemic, according to the new watchdog Public Health England

Professor Kevin Fenton, the agency's Director of Health Improvement and Population Healthcare, said that authorities should use 'local individual plans' as part of a 'range of effective tools' to combat obesity.

He suggested that restaurants should also reduce portion sizes for children and promote healthier food.

Professor Fenton said that information on pupils' height and weight, which is already collected by schools and passed to the Department of Health, could be utilised more effectively.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'Innovation can be put in place at the local level when local councils understand the nature of the epidemic and take steps to help to intervene.'

Recent figures show that a tenth of British children are obese when they start school, while twice many are obese when starting senior school.

Overall, a third of children are overweight or obese by the time they are in their final year at primary school.

In 2011/12, 9.5 per cent of children in reception class aged four and five were classed as obese, rising to one in five pupils in year six aged ten and 11.

Fuelling the epidemic is a lack of attention from parents, with almost half of parents whose children are obese wrongly stating that their children were 'about the right weight'.

The watchdog also suggested that councils should be given the power to formulate health programmes to deal with obesity head on

A recent Department of Health briefing suggested that current obesity rates are worse, with 22 per cent of four to five-year-olds classed as obese and 34 per cent of 10 to 11-year-olds.

Referring to Britain's 'obesogenic environment', Professor Fenton said: 'It is about being mindful about what we are offering to our kids and ensuring we are looking at portion control and healthier options in schools, pubs or community - all of us have a role to play.

Speaking about a potential ban on unhealthy food adverts on children's television, he added: 'Are we ensuring that we don't have access to unhealthy TV adverts at a time when kids are watching television. Should we be thinking about how those advertisements are being placed?

'In other countries they have delinked advertisements which promote toys and food, adverts that promote kids coming into restaurant establishments, that is one of the options that is being looked at.'

The warning comes shortly after doctors claimed that parents are creating a 'cancer timebomb' by letting their children spend too long sitting down.

The experts also claimed that children are being put at risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes because of their sedentary lifestyles.
