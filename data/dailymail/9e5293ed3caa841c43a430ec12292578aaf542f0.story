An alleged would-be robber was shot dead after a botched stick-up attempt.

Justin Slivinski, 24, of Oviedo, Florida, was killed Friday night when he and accomplice Austin Lee Harvey, 19, tried to rob a man at a local drive-through ATM, police say.

Slivinski and Harvey were allegedly armed with knives when they approached the victim's truck at about 10.20 p.m. at a Fairwinds Credit Union ATM, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

When the two robbers drew their knives, the victim pulled out a handgun and shot Slivinksy twice. Slivinski was taken to a local hospital, where he died.

Harvey ran off after the shooting but a tipster led deputies to him soon after.

Harvey was arrested Saturday afternoon and now faces attempted armed robbery and murder charges.

Police say the murder charge was added because robbery attempt contributed to Slivinski's death.
