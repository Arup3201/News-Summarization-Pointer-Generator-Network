By his own exorbitantly high standards, Cristiano Ronaldo had been in something of a rut as of late. 

The three-time Ballon d'Or winner had failed to score in his past three games for Real Madrid and was under scrutiny from some sections of the Spanish press ahead of Los Blancos' round of 16 Champions League tie with Schalke.

But in the 26th minute, Ronaldo proved his doubters wrong, thumping a powerful header past third-choice keeper Timon Wellenreuther from Daniel Carvajal's cross to give Real a 1-0 lead.

It was refreshing to see that the media's cynicism had not spilled over into Real's fanbase and several supporters brought banners of well-wishes for Ronaldo.

To the casual observer, three games without a goal might not seem that big a deal, especially considering that Ronaldo had already netted 36 times beforehand.  

But the mini-drought came as a sub-plot to a wider concern about the player's form or rather his attitude. 

Ronaldo was recently criticised for going ahead with his birthday celebrations in a nightclub just hours after Real had lost 4-0 to city rivals Atletico in the Madrid derby.

The goal against Schalke, incidentally, was Ronaldo's 464th for club and country since starting his career in 2002.
