She didn’t let pregnancy slow her down, and it seems Zara Phillips is determined not to let the stresses of having a young child get the better of her either.

Like many modern mothers Zara has shunned the traditional longer period of maternity leave, instead opting to return to work mere months after giving birth.

The Queen’s granddaughter took part in a cross country course walk for Musto clothing competition winners during day three of the Mitsubishi Motors Badminton Horse Trials in Badminton today.

Zara, whose face was partially concealed beneath a baseball cap and sunglasses, seemed to really be enjoying the day

Clearly at ease in her beloved countryside, the 32-year-old royal smiled and laughed with her companions, covering her face with a large pair of sunglasses and a bright blue baseball cat.

Dressing practically for the days activities, Zara wore a pair of jeans under sturdy brown knee high walking boots, keeping warm in an anorak displaying the logos of the event’s supporters.

The rather blustery and unpredictable weather didn't seem to bother the group.

Despite only having given birth to her first child, Mia, in January, Zara has already regained her fit physique, no doubt helped by her levels of exercise both during the pregnancy and after the birth.

Although she took an eight-month break from eventing the accomplished equestrian, who has represented Britain in the Olympics made her competitive comeback just months after giving birth.

The new mother galloped to ninth place at the end of last month at the Symm International Horse Trials in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

The embodiment of modern motherhood, Zara was seen cradling her three-month-old, the Queen's fourth great-grandchild, in between the trials.

She has since competed in various trials and spotted at numerous racing events, as she effortlessly combines motherhood with her career.
