Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola insists he will not be tempted into the transfer market again this summer despite the club's growing injury list.

The German champions face bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup on Wednesday but they will be without Rafinha and Thiago Alcantara, with key man Franck Ribery also a major doubt.

Yet the Spaniard is adamant that he has the depth necessary to compete on all fronts this season and he does not need any further additions in this transfer window. 

No more players: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola insists he does not need anymore signings

Ready: Bayern face rivals Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup on Wednesday evening

 

Doubt: Winger Franck Ribery (left) is unlikely to feature against Dortmund on Wednesday in the Super Cup

Guardiola said: 'No, no new players. Thiago will be back and Rafa will be back and Franck will be back so I am happy about this squad.'

French winger Ribery is still struggling to recover his fitness following the back injury which ruled him out of the World Cup, while defender Rafinha tore ankle ligaments at the weekend.

Thiago, meanwhile, is continuing his recovery from knee ligament damage he sustained in May and Guardiola will not put a date on when he will return to the fold. 

Guardiola is also adamant that he will be able to give his six World Cup winners adequate rest this season by rotating his squad accordingly. 

The 43-year-old said: 'Thiago will be back soon. He really wants to come back as soon as possible but for these issues we have a doctor and you should ask him

'It's great for these players and obviously for the club (to have six World Cup winners),' he said.

'They have time, I know what they can do but they need time. At the moment we have no time.'

Looking ahead to the Dortmund game, Guardiola says he must asses the availability of his players. 

He explained: 'We have training today. I have until the last moment to decide who plays. Who can play for how long, 15 minutes or 20 or 30 minutes.

'This is a final, and it is not about testing and trying out things. No, no, I am clear about what we need to do. I know who our opponents are, how hard it is going to be. It is not about testing anything.

'I think I only have eight or nine players who can play the full 90 minutes. So I have to see who can play and for how long.'

Rotation: Guardiola says he will utilise his squad this summer so his World Cup stars do not get fatigued
