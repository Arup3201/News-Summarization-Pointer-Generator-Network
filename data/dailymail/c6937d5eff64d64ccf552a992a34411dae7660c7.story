Chelsea midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah is discussing a possible loan move to Bordeaux.

Chalobah returned to Chelsea last week after an unproductive loan spell at Burnley where he made just four appearances.

The 20-year-old is highly rated at Chelsea and Jose Mourinho will be keen for Chalobah to sign for a club where he will play first-team football for the second half of the season.

The England youth international had spent the previous two seasons playing Championship football with loan spells at Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest and Watford.

Chalobah has featured 21 times for the England Under-21s but is yet to make an appearance for Chelsea's first team.

Meanwhile, Bordeaux president Jean Louis Tiraud wants an answer from Arsenal in the next 24 hours about the future of Yaya Sanogo.

Arsene Wenger wants Sanogo to go on loan to a Premier League club and Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Swansea, Stoke and Everton have shown an interest.

But Tiraud said: 'Sanogo wants to come on loan to Bordeaux, and he has told his manager Arsene Wenger that.

'We are working on bringing Sanogo to Bordeaux. We are going all in on this target. We have asked Arsenal to give us an answer on Tuesday or Wednesday latest.'
