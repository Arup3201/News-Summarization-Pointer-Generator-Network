A London-based artist was shot dead while protecting his family when four gunmen burst into his first wedding anniversary party in South Africa.

Clinton De Menezes, 43, was gunned down when the armed men climbed a balcony of a friend’s house near Durban where the artist was celebrating in the early hours of New Year’s Eve.

A friend and best man, Simon Malpas, grappled with the gunmen and attacked them with a chair to try and keep them out of the house.

Mr De Menezes, who lived in west London 
until he moved to Kenya last year, hid his wife and seven-year-old 
daughter Eva in a bathroom and was killed as he tried to fight of the 
assailants.

Hero: London-based artist Clinton De Menezes with his wife Nicola and seven-year-old daughter Eva whom he saved from four gunmen who shot him dead after bursting into his first anniversary party

As Mr De Menezes lay dying his wife Nicola Saward kissed him and then closed his eyes, the Evening Standard reported.

She thanked him for being a loving father and husband, a friend said. His daughter Eva, who was hidden in a laundry basket, also said goodbye to her father.

The four men escaped with a wallet and three mobile phones. Four suspects have been arrested after police recovered a 9mm pistol from the scene.

The couple, who got together a decade ago, had flown to Durban to celebrate their anniversary with Mr Malpas and his wife Amanda in the nearby town of Westville.

Mr De Menezes was born in South Africa
 and moved to the UK in 2007.

His art includes paintings, installations,
 drawings and photography.

It has been displayed in galleries across the world including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

Today Antonio Capelao, who runs the Bicha Gallery in Fulham and has worked with Mr De Menezes since 2011, said he was 'absolutely devoted to his family'.

Mr Capelao said: 'A friend called and told me what happened on the phone. I couldn’t believe it for a long time - I still can’t believe it now.

'I was so shocked. I just didn’t know what to do to be honest.

'He was a very interesting guy, but he also was absolutely devoted to his family. When he told me they were moving to Nairobi I said "why?".

'But he said "My family is going and my place is with my family". He had a very strong family bond.'

He said Mr De Menezes was 'very professional' and a 'fun guy'.

He added: 'The last time I spent time with him was last summer. I spent a few hours chatting with him in his garden. We were talking about all sorts of things over a glass of Prosecco.

'This is another tragic thing - his career was really taking off and his sales were amazing.

'His work was sitting in New York next to work by famous artists like the Indian Sculptor Anish Kapoor. I’ve shown it all over the world, in Hong Kong, Singapore, New York.

'He was an inspiring artist and a man of integrity. Our thoughts and hearts go out to Nicola, Eva and his family and friends.'
