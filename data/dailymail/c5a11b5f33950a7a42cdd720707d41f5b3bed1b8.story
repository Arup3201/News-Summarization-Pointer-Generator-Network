The discovery of a room-dividing screen decorated by Charles Dickens with 800 images of the great and the good of the day has stunned historians.

It is believed to have been created in 1850 by Victorian novelist Dickens and his actor friend William Macready to educate the thespian's children and is a Who's Who of famous people from the 19th century.

It includes images of the Duke of Wellington, Napoleon, Isaac Newton, Admiral Nelson, William Blake, Mozart, George III, Byron, John Swift, Samuel Butler, William Hogarth and George Washington.

Scenes from Shakespeare plays like Henry VIII were also stuck onto the screen by the two friends who spent hours gluing etchings and prints to the 7ft tall divider at the actor's home

Charles Dickens came into contact with several of society's most prominent figures during a career that saw him undertake several roles.

The Great Expectations author once worked as a reporter, covering Parliamentary proceeding, where he interacted with several politicians.

He later took up a post as editor of The Daily News in 1846.

Dickens used that platform to encourage social transformation.

Philanthropist Dickens, together with friend Charles West helped Great Ormond Street Hospital survive financial struggle.

Dickens also held ties with several well known figures in America, Ralph Waldo Emerson who led the Transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century, and poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. 

Rebecca Donnan, the expert who is restoring the artefact, said: 'It really is a lovely thing and it is remarkable the difference when the surface grime is removed.

'It is a very complicated object with multiple layers. It has a timber frame with textile stretched across it with etchings and engravings on that.

'They have been stuck on with an animal or wheat starch glue and then varnished over. There have also been running repairs and it has aged and deteriorated and the wood has created acidity.

'The varnish has discloured and it has been in a room with coal fire and people smoking.

'I'm cleaning it with a special gel and also saliva. Saliva is viscous and has a special enzyme that helps remove dirt.

'It only works for a short time because it has to be at body temperature, but it lifts the dirt.'

The descendents of Macready recently 
gave the screen to the Friends of Sherborne House - Macready's old home 
in Dorset.

John Sutherland-Smith, chairman of the Friends of Sherborne House, said: "The screen was put together in the 1850s.

'Charles Dickens and William Macready were very close friends; Nicholas Nickleby was dedicated to Mcready.

'The family story is that Dickens would visit Macready and together they made the screen, probably to educate the children.

On closer investigation, playwright William Shakespeare (left) is also seen as well as a portrait believed to be that of Henry VIII (right) who became King of England in 1509

'It is canvas on a wood frame and the pictures are probably from periodicals and have been stuck on with glue in a large collage.

'The pictures include the names of the day as well as Shakespeare and classical history - things Macready would want his children to know.'

The 10ft wide screen was found among the possessions of Sir Neville Macready's late mother and was bequeathed to the Friends of Sherborne House.

Sherborne House, was built in 1740, and is currently being sold by Dorset County Council which used to run it as a school.

The screen is being restored having been left to gather dirt for a reported 160 years

The restoration is being completed with the unlikely use of saliva in order to remove the dirt that the screen has accumulated over time
