Men are more likely to make women hot under the collar by switching on a blender than turning on a power tool, according to new research.

A team of neuroscientists were flown in from London to conduct scientific testing on 20 Australian couples to determine what domestic duties aroused women the most.

While their male partners were performing activities from traditional do-it-yourself tasks and drilling to cake mixing, coffee-making and blending, their female counterparts had their mental, emotional and physiological responses monitored.

New research has found women are more aroused by their man cooking in the kitchen than using power tools

The research - which is the first of its kind in Australia - was commissioned by home appliances brand Sunbeam.

It was found that female partners were more aroused when their significant others were making a cup of coffee or whipping up a cake (57.5 per cent) than using a power drill or a saw (55 per cent).

Additionally, women were happier when their man was cooking than helping around the house, including ironing and building flat-pack furniture.

The research also showed that seven out of 10 women likened receiving a home-made coffee from their partner to receiving a gift or a loving embrace.

Sexologist and relationship expert Dr Nikki Goldstein said she was not surprised by the findings.

'As a woman, I agree with the research,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'But it will surprise some men because I think a lot of men think women are turned on by men doing masculine activities.'

Dr Goldstein said seeing men in the kitchen showed off their creativity, especially with the rise of more male celebrity chefs like Curtis Stone.

'They’re thinking outside the box and I think that is very appealing to a women,' she said.

'Men can say "I care about you, I love you" but when they make something tangible like a coffee, it shows them they care.'

Dr Goldstein also advised couples to spend more time together in the kitchen to strengthen their bond.

'I think it’s good for couples to get in the kitchen together because they can share what happened during their day and experience something together,' she said.
