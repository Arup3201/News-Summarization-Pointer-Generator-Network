Police officers carrying out stop and search checks will be forced to wear body cameras, under radical plans set out by the Liberal Democrats today.

Armed police and riot squads will also be forced to wear cameras to record their behaviour under the plan, Home Office minister Norman Baker announced.

The proposal is designed to restore public confidence in the system amid concerns raised by the Home Secretary Theresa May that black and ethnic minorities are unfairly targeted by police officers.

The Lib Dems also want to force police to get a judge’s permission before carrying out certain stop and searches.

Black people in Britain are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched than white Britons

Under the current rules, a senior officer can authorise stop and searches in a certain area without any suspicion of wrongdoing – if they fear violence is about to erupt or that people are carrying weapons without good reason.

But there has been widespread concern over the way these ‘Section 60’ powers are used.

Black and Asian youths are significantly more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white Britons.

Earlier this year, the Home Secretary Theresa May pledged to tighten rules on stop-and-search amid warnings that as many as 250,000 a year may have been illegal.

Today, Mr Baker promised to go further. He said: ‘Far too many innocent people are subjected to stop-and-search, which is often based on crude stereotyping of minorities.’

He added: ‘Stop-and-search has led to tension, and it’s something that cannot be ignored.’

Lib Dem minister Norman Baker wants police making stop and searches to wear body cameras

The Lib Dems have pointed to figures showing black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people.

In some areas this rises to 29 times more likely, according to research released by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in November last year.

Those from Asian or other ethnic minority groups were twice as likely to be stopped as white people;

In London, black people were nearly 7 times more likely to be stopped, mixed race people 2.6 times more likely and Asians and others twice as likely.

The Lib Dems said body cameras would ‘help build confidence in the Police, and give the public the reassurance that both the Police and public’s actions will be recorded’.

The Metropolitan Police is running a series of trials of body cameras. Senior officers believe footage of incidents of officers responding to life-threatening and other situations will show the force’s professionalism.

They highlight the images caught by the public of armed officers overpowering the killers of drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich last year.

The pilot scheme follows controversy over the death of Mark Duggan, 29, who was shot by Met marksmen in Tottenham in August 2011. Riots erupted in the area after the killing.

Officers, including 999 response teams, in 10 London boroughs have been equipped with 500 small cameras as part of the trial. Firearms officers will also be testing the technology.

Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe believes the use of cameras will help to fight crime, defuse violent situations, lead to speedier justice and make the force more accountable.

A Met spokesman said: ‘Officers taking part have been given training and guidance about when cameras are to be used, which means they will routinely collect evidence in incidents such as domestic abuse and public order, but also for potentially contentious interactions such as the use of stop-and-search.’
