From sexy lingerie to nail varnish, it seems any products can be linked to the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film.

But now JD Williams has turned the erotic novel on its head by launching its 'Over 50 Shades of Grey' lingerie campaign.

Aimed at the more mature woman, the range is far from the leather and lace usually associated with the EL James books, and is all modeled by women over the age of 50.

The women hold signs proclaiming 'Age is just a number', and 'We're over 50 shades of grey', while proudly showing off their figures in simple but elegant shapewear from the retailer.

The campaign is in direct response to research showing that three out of five UK women aged 50 plus feel underrepresented in the media.

The mature market currently stands as the UK’s fastest growing fashion sector, which is now worth £6.7bn and is emerging as Britain’s most powerful consumer group, yet it’s widely ignored.

The brand hopes that the images, which will be shown online, will promote body confidence for all women regardless of age, shape and size.

Modeled by women over the age of 50 and hair various 'shades of grey' the campaign makes a tongue-in-cheeky connection with the upcoming film adaptation of the erotic novel

JD Williams spokesperson Carie Barkhuizen said: 'We can expect to be bombarded with images of young women looking luscious in lingerie at this time of year, but what about the more mature woman? 

'Interestingly, our research also discovered that 52 per cent of UK women feel most confident over the age of 45, so what better way to showcase that confidence by featuring mature models over 50 looking just as fantastic – and sexy – in lingerie as their younger counterparts?

'Age is just a number and I think our campaign proves that you can good in lingerie at any age!'
