Daniel Agger has claimed that Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers doesn't think he's 'good enough' to select him in the Reds' first team.

The Danish defender struggled to nail down a starting position under Rodgers last season and is unsure whether he has a future at Anfield.

When asked about his Liverpool future, Agger told the Daily Mirror: 'I don’t know. That’s up to the manager. I can’t go and put myself on the team sheet.

'It definitely wasn’t great to be left out, but I don’t make the decisions.

'I think it is because the manager doesn’t think that I’m good enough.'

However, the 29-year-old insists that no decision will be made about his future until he has returned from his summer holidays.

'I’m not thinking about my future,' he said.

'Now my focus is on the next international games with Denmark. Then I’m looking forward to a long five-week holiday. My body and mind need to relax.'
