In a move that adds new meaning to the term surfing the web, researchers are working on creating a 'deep-sea internet'.

A team of scientists from New York have already successfully experimented sending data below the surface in Lake Erie, and are now hoping to create an industry standard for underwater communications in the world's seas and oceans.

The technology could be used to send data between submarines, for example, collect and send data from the sea floor to help detect tsunamis and other disasters sooner, as well as monitor fish and mammal numbers. 

A team of scientists from New York have begun testing an underwater Wi-Fi network. The system involves data being sent to and from two 40lb sensors, pictured, using sound waves. The data can be sent in real-time from a laptop and the sensors have a wider underwater range than current radio wave technology does

Traditional networks, used on land, use radio waves to send data through satellites and antennae.

Radio waves have a weak range 
underwater so agencies such as the Navy and National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) use 
sound wave-based methods to communicate underwater.

Melodia's system sends commands and data from a laptop to two 40lb sensors placed on the sea bed.

These commands are converted into sound waves that transmit data back to laptops and other wireless devices in real-time.

Other examples given by the team, led by Tommaso Melodia, associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of Buffalo, include offshore oil and natural gas exploration, surveillance, pollution monitoring and more. 

'A submerged wireless network will give us an unprecedented ability to collect and analyse data from our oceans in real time,' said Melodia.

'Making this information available to anyone with a smartphone or computer, especially when a tsunami or other type of disaster occurs, could help save lives.'

Traditional networks, used on land, use radio waves to send data through satellites and antennae.

Radio waves have a weak range underwater so agencies such as the Navy and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) use 
sound wave-based methods to communicate underwater.

For example, NOAA relies on 
acoustic waves to send data from tsunami sensors on the sea floor to 
surface buoys.

The buoys convert the acoustic waves into radio waves to 
send the data to a satellite, which then redirects the radio waves back 
to land-based computers - a slow and lengthy process.

Melodia's system would solve this problem by sending data between a network of underwater sensors to laptops, 
smartphones and other wireless devices in real-time using sound waves.

Electrical engineering students including Hovannes Kulhandjia, pictured, have already successfully experimented sending data below the surface in Lake Erie, pictured. The team hopes to use the technology to detect tsunamis more accurately, monitor the levels of fish and mammals, search for natural gas and more

During tests, Hovannes Kulhandjian, left, and Zahed Hossain, right, sent a command to the sensors. They knew it had been successful when the soundwaves ricocheted off a nearby concrete wall

Melodia recently tested the system in 
Lake Erie by dropping 
two, 40lb sensors into the water.

Reserachers Hovannes Kulhandjian 
and Zahed Hossain typed a command into a
 laptop that was transmitted to the sensors.

A series of high-pitched chirps bounced off a
 nearby concrete wall seconds later, indicating that the command had been received by the sensors and activated the sound from the sensor.

A deep-sea internet could, for example, join networks of buoys together that can detect 
tsunamis quicker and more reliably than current methods, said Melodia. 

It could also be used by the energy industry to search for underwater oil and natural gas.

'We could even use it to monitor fish
 and marine mammals, and find out how to best protect them from shipping
 traffic and other dangers,' Melodia continued.

'An internet underwater has 
so many possibilities.'

Melodia's work is detailed in the The Internet Underwater: An IP-compatible Protocol Stack for Commercial Undersea Modems paper being presented at the annual International Conference on Underwater Networks & Systems in Taiwan in November.
