A 14-year-old Colorado boy will spend 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to killing his father and trying to conceal the slaying for six days by keeping the body at home and telling the man's employer he was sick.

The boy, who was identified by local news outlets as Kai Kelly, entered the plea Tuesday under a deal with prosecutors and will be sentenced Thursday, The Vail Daily reported.

He will serve seven years in youth prison before entering adult prison on his 21st birthday to serve the last three years of his sentence.

Investigators say the teen was 13 when shot his 50-year-old father, Joseph Kelly Jr., twice in the head with a rifle on or around April 30, when the man was scheduled to meet with a sheriff's deputy investigating a graffiti case involving the teen.

The father didn't show up for the meeting or work. 

The son called his father's boss for several days to say he was sick, but the employer became suspicious and alerted authorities.

When deputies arrived at the home, the boy answered the door and told them his father was dead inside.

During Tuesday's court hearing, the teen sat quietly and answered questions from Judge Fred Gannett to make sure the teen knew to what he was agreeing.

After the proceedings, the boy smiled softly when his mother, who was divorced from the father, was allowed to sit beside him at the defendant's table to talk before he was taken back into detention. 

Authorities said they still don't know a motive for the killing.

Before the slaying, the boy was under 
scrutiny for spraying graffiti, the Eagle County Sheriff's Office said.  

The
 sheriff's office said the boy's mother had not been living in the home 
with her son or ex-husband.

Neighbors
 told KCNC-TV that the man and his son lived in the home for more than a
 year, but no one heard anything out of the ordinary until deputies 
showed up.

Joseph Kelly's employer at the Eagle County ECO Transit Department said the son called in to report his father sick several days in a row. He grew suspicious and reported the situation at around 11.30am Monday.

'Several' types of weapons were in the home, according to VailDaily.

The Denver Post reported Kai Kelly was a student at St. Clare of Assisi Catholic School, and he also has been taking lessons at a karate school in Gypsum. In November, he took third place at the U.S. Karate Nationals.
