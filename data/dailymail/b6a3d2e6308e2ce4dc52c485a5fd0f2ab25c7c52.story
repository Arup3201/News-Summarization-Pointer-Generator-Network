Spring City Councilman Neil Sorensen wants every citizen and teacher armed. The full city council has agreed to debate the bill next month.

Officials in a small Utah town want to
make sure every head of household has a firearm and knows how to use it, and
they want to give school teachers training with guns too.

Spring City Councilman Neil Sorensen first
proposed an ordinance requiring a gun in every household in the town of 1,000.

The rest of the council scoffed at making it a requirement, but they
unanimously agreed to move forward with an ordinance "recommending"
the idea.

The council also approved funding to offer
concealed firearms training Friday to the 20 teachers and administrators at the
local elementary school.

'It sends a statement that criminals
better think twice,' Sorensen told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

'If a teacher would have had a concealed weapon in Sandy Hook, I think the
death loss would have been fewer. If sane, trained people had guns, they could
have shot back.'

Sandy Hook is the school in Newtown,
Connecticut, where a man killed 20 children and six adults in a rampage in
December.

The measure, which will go before the full
council in February for further review, seems to have the support of the
council's five members and many residents in the farming community about 90
miles south of Salt Lake City.

But school administrators don't think
arming teachers is wise, and they are not encouraging teachers to participate
in Friday's training.

'The more guns you have in the
school, the more dangerous it is,' said Leslie Keisel, superintendent of
the North Sanpete School District.

Councilman Noel Bertelson said making guns
in every house mandatory was too much, but he agrees the town would be safer if
everyone was armed. With only a part-time police force, he said, response time
is not like it is in a big city.

'If a person is able to take care of
themselves for a while, it would probably be a good thing,' Bertelson
said.

Police lead students out of Sandy Hook Elementary School last month after 20 children were fatally shot. Sorensen said mass shootings such as this would be reduced if teachers had guns

The community is still reeling from the
double-murder on New Year's Eve 2011 of an elderly couple in nearby Mount
Pleasant. Sorensen said what used to be a peaceful, quiet town has been sullied
by increasing criminal activity.

Thefts of metal for scrap and other
property also have become a problem, Councilman Boyd Mickel said.

'We are kind of tired of people
breaking in and taking stuff,' said Mickel, explaining why he voted to
urge every house to have a gun.

Timm Thompson, a coal miner and father of
four girls who lives in Spring City, backs the council's measure.

'People think small towns are a good
place to live,' Thompson said. 'But there is more crime and drugs
than you can imagine.'

Thompson, who owns 78 guns he keeps locked
in a safe, doesn't want teachers to act as police officers. He said some kids
are "hooligans" and could overpower teachers for the guns.

The legislation would arm and train every citizen with a gun, such as this one

Sisters Katy Harmer and Caroline Lott,
however, say arming teachers would make them feel better about sending their
children to the Spring City Elementary School. The co-owners of the town's
coffee shop, Das Coffee, said most Spring City residents keep guns for hunting,
leaving only a handful without weapons.

Spring City leaders say they got the idea
from a city in Georgia that passed a similar law. In 1982, Kennesaw, Georgia,
made headlines by requiring heads of households to own a gun and ammunition.

On
its website, Kennesaw boasts that its burglary rate declined after the law took
effect.

But Thomas doesn't believe having more
armed teachers would necessarily prevent or mitigate the damage in mass
shootings. Utah law allows teachers to have concealed weapon in classrooms, but
the district doesn't advocate for that, Thomas said.

'By bringing weapons into school, are
we creating more problems than we are solving?' he asked. 'It could
create a new problem. We don't want to deal with that problem.'
