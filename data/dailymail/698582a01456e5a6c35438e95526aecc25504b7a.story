Michigan police officers have been deemed 'heroic' after taking down a rampaging knifeman without shooting him dead after he stabbed three passengers and a conductor on an Amtrak train.

Michael Williams, 44, from Saginaw, allegedly attacked two men, one woman and an employee at a station near N 6th Street and Pokagon Street in Niles, 100 miles east of Chicago, on Friday evening.

Within seconds, police stormed the train and spotted Wilson wielding a knife, it is said. But instead of firing at the suspect, they subdued him with a Taser, before handcuffing him and taking him to jail.

The train's conductor was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, while the other victims were treated for less serious injuries. They have now all been stabilized, according to reports.

It comes just a day after Los Angeles police officers shot dead an apparently armed man near the city's famous Hollywood and Highland intersection in front of dozens of shocked tourists.

It also comes as protesters across the U.S. are demonstrating against grand juries' decisions not to indict two police officers for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown and 43-year-old father, Eric Garner

On Saturday, Tyler Vandermolen,  a passenger on the Blue Water service at the time of the Niles stabbings, credited the cops who arrived at the scene with preventing even more bloodshed.

'It was pretty incredible that they may have saved some lives,' she told The Associated Press.

Niles Police Chief, Jim Millin, said officers had been dispatched to the Amtrak station following a report of a passenger acting suspiciously on the train from Chicago to Port Huron in Michigan.

Speaking of the moment they arrived on the platform shortly after 7pm, Mr Millin said: 'They saw commotion in the train car. They had to forcefully work their way through the crowd.

'As soon as the first officer turned into the car, Mr Williams was less than 10 feet away and he had the knife in his hand. The officer used his Taser and was able to subdue him.'

Train: The train's conductor was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, while the other victims were treated for less serious injuries. Above, the Blue Water service was cordoned off by police for around six hours

Station: The victims have now all been stabilized, according to reports. However, they are yet to be identified

'Certainly, there's a possibility he could have kept on assaulting passengers and things could have been a lot worse' if the officers had not acted in the way they did, he added. 

Williams was charged with attempted murder on Saturday following the stabbings in Niles, around 10 miles north of South Bend, Indiana. He is being held on $1million bond at Berrien County jail.

Mr Millin said the motive for the attack remains unknown, saying: 'It doesn't appear he was screaming or in anger against any of these people. He just started cutting and stabbing.'

After the stabbings, at least one of the four victims was taken to SB Memorial Hospital with stab wounds. Two others are believed to have been hospitalized at Lakeland Healthcare Hospital in Niles

Response: On Saturday, Tyler Vandermolen, a passenger on the Amtrak service at the time of the Niles stabbings, credited the cops who arrived at the scene (pictured) with preventing even more bloodshed

Emergency crews: 'It was pretty incredible that they may have saved some lives,' Ms Vandermolen said

Shocked: Commuter Chris Maynard, who posted a photo of a black male suspect lying on the floor of the train, tweeted: 'Crazy world we live in. Some man just stabbed 4 people one car away from me on the train'

A woman named Amanda said: 'As a commuter, the stabbing on an Amtrak train really has me concerned'

Passenger Caitlin Cipri, who was travelling on the train from Chicago to Port Huron, Michigan, said she was packing up her things to leave the car when she heard a loud screaming.

She said she initially thought the suspect was punching a passenger until she saw the butt of a knife. She then reportedly saw the man stab two other people.

'It was terrifying and you don't think something like that is going to happen to you,' she told the South Bend Tribune in Indiana. 'It's terrifying that things like this happen.'

On Friday night, people across America were taking to Twitter to express their shock at the stabbings on the train, which was carrying 172 passengers at the time.

Alongside the image, Mr Maynard wrote: 'Crazy world we live in. Some man just stabbed 4 people one car away from me on the train.' He later told CBS police used stun guns to subdue the suspect.

Another commuter, Gerald Stewart, tweeted a photo showing blood spattered across the floor of the train car, with the caption: 'Multiple standings in Michigan... sad, sad stuff.' 

One Twitter user, using the handle @Mic_Hael_97, wrote: 'The Amtrak station has so many cops... crazy someone would do that.' 

Investigation: Police are investigating the incident at the station (pictured). The train set off from Chicago

And a woman named Amanda, also from Chicago, said: 'As a commuter, the stabbing on an Amtrak train really has me concerned.'  

In a statement, Amtrak said the incident took place on board Train #364 at the Niles Train Station. The train finally resumed its journey at 1.20 am on Saturday.

The victims of the stabbings are yet to be identified. Williams, who apparently had a drug conviction in Saginaw County in 1997, is scheduled to appear at court on Monday

Police are investigating.
