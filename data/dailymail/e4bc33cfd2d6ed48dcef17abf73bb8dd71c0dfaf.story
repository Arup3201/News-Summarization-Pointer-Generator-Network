A brave Abigail Hernandez today faced her alleged kidnapper with a surprise appearance in court  to see him held on $1million bail.

Abigail arrived with her mother Zenya and sister Sarah and looked pale and drawn as she took her place on the front bench. It was her first public appearance since returning home last week after going missing nine months.

The suspect Nathaniel Kibby, 34, walked into court flanked by his publicly provided legal team, wearing an orange jumpsuit and requested financial legal aid.

Details of what led authorities to arrest Kibby were not released in Conway Circuit Court today, but a law enforcement source earlier revealed the suspicion that Abigail was held hostage in a shipping container on Kibby's property.

Abigail's presence in court today, 
sitting just steps away from Kibby, came as a surprise since family 
friends told NBC News that she wouldn't show.

As soon as the hearing finished the Hernandez family rushed from the court.

Following
 the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Jane Young held a press 
conference where she said Abby has a 'level of strength that I'm not 
sure many of us have'.

During
 the hearing, Young asked to have the case files sealed for 10 days 
while they continue to search Kibby's home  in the course of the 
investigation. At the press conference, Young added that they are not 
currently investigating any other suspects.

Kibby
 is due back in court on August 12 for a probable cause hearing, at 
which point more details of Abigail's disappearance may be revealed, 
Young said.

Before the hearing, Zenya looked 
incredibly animated and upset, sitting next to her two daughters and 
supporters Amanda Smith and Paul Kirsch.

She
 could be seen arguing with an officer, believed to be a member of the 
FBI. Paul, who helped run the Find Abby webpage, had to talk to her to 
calm her down. A line of State Troopers, FBI Agents and police officers 
protectively sat behind the family.

The
 arrest yesterday of the 15-year-old's alleged abductor has only left 
more questions in her mysterious nine-month disappearance, and surprise 
return home.

While little has been publicly said about what led to Kibby's arrest, a law enforcement source told NECN
 that they believe he kept Abigail hostage in an orange shipping 
container at the back of his property, located 30 miles north of her 
hometown of Conway where she reappeared last week.

That shipping container is now surrounded by crime scene tape and neighbors have described the large storage box to WMUR as an 'above-ground bunker' that they believed was soundproof.

Many of Kibby's neighbors have 
described him as 'scary' but still said there was no indication he was 
hiding a teenage girl on his property.

Neighbor Michelle Smith says she hopes the shipping container wasn't used to hold Abigail hostage.

'I would hope not,' she told WMUR. 'I would hope that she can't be that close and nobody knew it.'

But those who lived close to Kibby were also wary.

'He's
 been called crazy Nate. I don't know too much about him, he's pretty 
much a loner. But I always told the girls stay away from that trailer,' 
neighbor Debbie Demers told NECN.

'He likes his guns and it was a little shooting range back there,' she added.

Kibby
 was arrested Monday afternoon at his home and charged with the felony 
kidnapping of Abigail 'with purpose to commit an offense against her.'

Strong: Assistant Attorney General Jane Young held a press conference after the arraignment Tuesday and said Abby has a 'level of strength that I'm not sure many of us have'

Distance: Abigail Hernandez returned home to Conway, New Hampshire last week after going missing for nine months. Her alleged abductor was arrested at his home 30 miles north in Gorham

Tuesday's court appearance will be one of many Kibby has had in the past few months while Abigail has been missing.

On
 October 22, just 13 days after Abigail went missing walking home from 
Kennett High School, Kibby was charged with marijuana possession in her 
hometown of North Conway. He plead guilty to the charge in court in 
December and settled it by paying $434.  It was also revealed that Kibby attended Kennett in the 90s and had a prior address in North Conway during those years.

And just last week, three days after Abigail showed up at home, Kibby was found guilty of criminal trespass.

The
 sentence and fine in the trespassing case was suspended for one year, 
as a judge ordered Kibby to stay away from his victims.

'When
 I heard it on the news, I was beside myself,' Tammy Shackford, a victim
 in the trespassing case, told WMUR. 'He is not a normal person. He is 
not right.'

According to a letter Kibby wrote the Sheriff's office, the trespassing case was in connection to a fight he got into after a car accident with a man identified as Eric Ray.

The argument allegedly turned violent when Kibby shoved Ray's wife Tammy, but he told authorities that Ray was exaggerating the incident.

'I considered informing (Eric Ray) I was armed with a carry pistol, but decided against it. I tried to sympathize with his anger and felt it was best to turn the cheek,' Kibby wrote.

The charges during Abigail's disappearance are just a few in Kibby's lengthy criminal history, that is centered mostly on his teen years.

When he was 17, Kibby was charged in five criminal trespassing cases, with two counts of receiving stolen property, providing false information to purchase a firearm and theft.

Hernandez family friend Paul Kirsch was with Abby and her mother Zenya when news broke of Kibby's arrest. 

He said he wasn't sure whether Abby knew Kibby, but is glad the family is finally getting some good news.

'The
 family can kind of get some closure. They thought they could get it 
when Abby came back. Then questions started. Now, they can get closure,'
 Kirsch said. 'The family is overwhelmed with support, and they are 
exhausted and frankly breathing for the first time in nine months. … 
This is one of the best days I can think of. Now they get to be the 
Hernandez family again.'

Abigail made headlines last October 9 -
 just days before her 15th birthday -  when she unexpectedly disappeared
 after last seen by her boyfriend walking home from school.

Clues: Last week police released video of Abby on the day she 
disappeared, left, and a sketch of a man they believe drove her away in a
 blue pick-up

The
 only contact she had with any friends or family was a letter believed 
to have been sent by the schoolgirl to her divorced parents, Zenya and 
Ruben Hernandez, in the weeks after her disappearance.

Then on July 20, she suddenly reappeared.

Kibby's
 arrest came just hours after Hernandez's mother gave an interview on 
Monday, to speak out against rumors surrounding her daughter's 
disappearance.

In an interview with the Today show, mother Zenya Hernandez shut down speculation that her daughter ran away because she was pregnant.

'She did not run away': Zenya Hernandez spoke with the Today show on Monday to dispell rumors her daughter ran away nine months ago because she was pregnant. Mrs Hernandez says she believes her daughter was abducted

'The
 majority of people somehow believe that she was pregnant. She was not. 
She did not run away. I firmly believe that,' Mrs Hernandez said, adding
 that she does not believe her daughter knew her alleged abductor.

On Saturday, police released a sketch of
 the man believed to have abducted Abigail, according to the teen's 
descriptions.

Despite conducting a three-hour 
interview with the teen, it is unclear whether they know where she was 
or if she was taken by force.

‘Our biggest challenge is, we’re 
dealing with incomplete information,’ Kieran Ramsey, assistant special 
agent in charge of the Boston Division of the FBI told The Boston Globe. ‘The
 victim in this case is a 15-year-old girl. It’s not as cut and dried as
 people think that somebody can exactly recount what happened, when, and
 where.’

They
 have also appealed for witnesses who may have seen Abby return after 
she was apparently dropped off on the same road that she was possibly 
abducted from all those months ago.

Sources
 close to the investigation said the teenager has so far not been able 
to tell officers many facts about her disappearance.

But
 they are convinced a crime has been committed - as they believe there 
is no way the 15-year-old could have stayed hidden for nine months 
without some kind of adult involvement.
