Carefree and beaming with joy as they make their way around the lazy rapids sat on an inflatable ring, these two young girls look like they are having the time of their lives at the water park.

With high colorful slides towering above the horizon in the background, it could be a scene from any thronged tourist attraction on a holiday island in Greece or Spain.

The sinister presence of soldiers dressed in full military regalia lurking around in the background is the only giveaway that this is in fact North Korea - a land not exactly renowned for it's laid back, fun-filled atmosphere.

The pictures - released by a state news agency - are the latest attempt by Kim Jong Un's propaganda machine to convince the rest of the world that the secretive communist state is a wonderful place to live.

The country is often portrayed as an isolated and poverty stricken state with one of the lowest living standards in the world.

But these pictures show Koreans at play - splashing around at the Munsu Water Park in the nation's capital, watching a 3D film, playing tennis and enjoying a ride on the bumper cars - in a bid to show that the country isn't all about military might.

A 'miniature world' resort featuring scaled down models of global landmarks such as Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower has been built and a luxury ski resort with a giant chalet and hotel complex is being built in a remote part of the country.

The apparent glamorous lifestyle in North Korea even extends to the nation's roads - instead of traffic lights and stop signs, attractive young women in pristine uniforms direct the traffic from the middle of the road instead.

Concentrate: Displaying riveting focus, they are only allowed to turn counter-clockwise, directing traffic with forceful and halting movements

Different: Instead of using traffic lights to control the stop and go flow of the cross-roads, attractive women dressed in perfectly crisps and identical outfits dangerously stand in the middle of the road on a small platform

But most North Koreans will never be able to afford to set foot in places like the luxury ski resort.

Over
 the past few months, numerous recreational sports parks, basketball 
courts and inline skating rinks have also been erected in Pyongyang.

They are part of a drive to get more people interested in taking part in recreational activities and particularly sport.

Officials
 hope that sport and recreation will help energise and mobilise the 
population - they call it the 'hot winds of sport blowing through 
Korea'.

'All of Wonsan 
will be turned into a tourist area,' Ri Ki Song, an economist for the 
Institute of Economy at North Korea's Academy of Social Science, said in
 a recent interview in the capital.

'It
 will have a big impact on the economy. We are now trying to build a lot
 of tourism sites, and skiing is the kind of sport that developed 
countries enjoy.

'It will also be a place for our own people to use.'
