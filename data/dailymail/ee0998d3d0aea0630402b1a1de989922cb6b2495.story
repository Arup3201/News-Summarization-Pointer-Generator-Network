America's NFL have put in place plans to embrace Remembrance Sunday with a lot more detail than previously shown by British sports in honouring the war dead.

Jacksonville and Dallas meet at Wembley on November 9 in the third regular-season NFL game there this autumn.

And, in a partnership with the Royal British Legion, the uniforms and helmets of both teams will feature the poppy logo, which will also be displayed to big effect on the pitch.

At the end of the match, 80,000 poppies will be dropped from the roof into the stands and all the kit and equipment will be auctioned, with the proceeds going to the Poppy Appeal that supports the Legion’s work with the Armed Forces.

Alistair Kirkwood, managing director of NFL UK, said: ‘The NFL has a tremendous respect and admiration for the service given by the military, both in the US and UK.’

Premier League clubs now all wear poppies on their shirts in fixtures around Remembrance Sunday but only after a Sportsmail campaign. England’s football team weren’t going to have poppies on their kit when they played Spain on November 12, 2011, owing to a FIFA edict but again Sportsmail pressure resulted in FIFA allowing poppies adorning black armbands.

Roy Keane’s second autobiography, to be released on October 9, is likely to create even more publicity than Kevin Pietersen’s book, which comes out on the same day.

The 43-year-old has not given his employers at Aston Villa or the FA of Ireland an advance view of the contents of The Second Half, written with award-winning author Roddy Doyle.

Keane will have the platform of being on international duty with the Republic of Ireland before the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany. Manager Martin O’Neill said: ‘We will just have to deal with it.’

Keane will surely have his say about former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who described him as an ‘intimidating ferocious individual’ in his recent memoirs.

A sure sign of cycling’s boom is the arrival on the scene of football agents. 

Leading middleman Mark Curtis is the first to recognise the opportunities and now represents newcomer Leopold Konig, who turned to Curtis to secure a dream move to Sky. 

It was Curtis who negotiated Konig’s two-year, seven-figure contract with Sky cycling chief Sir Dave Brailsford. The Czech is expected to be Chris Froome’s chief support rider next year.

Fulham owner Shahid Khan’s five-strong search committee to identify the next manager at Craven Cottage surprisingly includes fan David Daly, a senior director at Nike, when Fulham are in year two of a four-season kit contract with arch-rivals adidas. 

Previous boss Felix Magath was recommended by Craven Cottage CEO Alistair Mackintosh but chosen by Khan.

Bjorn in Ryder frame

European Tour board members expect Padraig Harrington and Thomas Bjorn to be sounded out about the Ryder Cup captaincy in 2016 as well as favourites Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez.

If Bjorn wants to be considered, it will complicate the selection process. The Dane, as chairman of the European tournament committee, was expected to be the fifth man on the nominations panel who would likely give a possible casting vote to Clarke.

Meanwhile, Clarke’s bid for the captaincy will not be helped by the upset caused when he withdrew from the 2014 race and publicly backed Colin Montgomerie rather than Paul McGinley.

It could cause complications if Thomas Bjorn (pictured left drenching Spain's Sergio Garcia, right, as they celebrate winning the Ryder Cup) becomes a contender for the post of Europe captain for 2016

Former Chelsea and Southampton star Ken Monkou, player of the year at Stamford Bridge in 1990, has been declared bankrupt following a number of failed business ventures. 

These included a proposed upmarket quarterly magazine Football Life that has gone into liquidation owing £216,000 to 44 creditors.

Wacky Leeds chairman Massimo Cellino’s view of win bonuses is that players should return them if they lose. So instead of a cash incentive, the Leeds team receive two extra shirts for a victory - much to the concern of the kitman.
