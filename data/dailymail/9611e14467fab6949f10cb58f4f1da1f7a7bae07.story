Jim Toth 'feels awful' that his wife Reese Witherspoon was involved in his DUI incident over the weekend, it has been reported.

The actress was arrested for disorderly conduct after allegedly resisting the orders of a police officer in Atlanta, Georgia, early on Friday morning.

She and Jim were both jailed after he failed to pass a sobriety test, and Reese has now pulled out of a scheduled appearance on Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday to save face.

Regrets: Jim Toth 'feels awful' for involving Reese Witherspoon in his DUI incident, it has been reported

While she has issued a publicly apology for her embarrassing behaviour, her CAA agent husband apparently feels just as bad.

A source close to Jim told People that he 'feels awful that he involved Reese in the situation.'

'He made a bad decision and it certainly made things worse that he dragged her 
into it.'

Jim was reported to have blown a .139 on the sobriety test, which is well above the legal limit of 0.08.

The source added that Jim 'has to pay the consequences, bottom line. He gets that.'

'Jim has always been a big social 
drinker,' the source went on. 'A lot of his job is being social. He's 
out to lunch or dinner almost every day of the week, schmoozing clients 
and taking business meetings.'

The insider said: '[The arrest is] 
just going to make the two of them stop and pause, and think about maybe
how much Jim's drinking plays a role in their lives – if it does or 
not.'

According to Late Night With Jimmy Fallon's website Reese will no longer be making an appearance on the show on Tuesday.

She was set to appear alongside footballer Eli Manning but her slot is now being filled by comedian Adam Ferrara.

It has also been claimed that the star has been hanging out with Chelsea Handler and Cameron Diaz in the wake of the incident.

She was spotted having drinks with 
her two famous friends and her husband at the Greenwich hotel on Sunday,
according to Us Weekly.

'Nobody was drunk - it was pretty 
tame,' a source told the publication, claiming the group instead sipped 
on San Pellegrino water. 'They all seemed really happy. There was no 
indication that there was anything wrong.'

Atlanta’s Department of Corrections 
confirmed that the couple were arrested on Friday after Toth was stopped
by a patrol car under suspicion of driving under the influence of 
alcohol.

According to a police report released on Sunday, Reese was handcuffed and briefly jailed for refusing to obey orders given to her by an officer of the law.

Reese, 37, and Toth, 42, were released on bail at 3:30 in the morning on Friday, before which the couple both posed for mugshots.

It was initially thought Reese and Jim would be in court on Monday morning in Atlanta, but TMZ reports the couple's cases have been postponed, with Reese's set for May 22 and Jim's for May 23.

The family is currently residing in Atlanta to shoot Reese’s new movie The Good Lie.

Toth was apprehended after midnight on Friday for recklessly weaving across Peachtree Street in the city of Atlanta.

The police report alleges that the Hollywood agent smelled of alcohol and appeared 'disheveled'.

After pulling the DUI suspect over, a sobriety test was conducted in a Walgreens parking lot.

Reese is said to have been warned to remain inside her vehicle, while her husband was subjected to the DUI test.

The officer on the scene claims that the actress became clearly agitated and eventually disobeyed his verbal commands.

The officer reported: ‘Mrs. 
Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not 
believe that I was a real police officer.’

The law enforcer explained in the report: ‘I told Mrs. Witherspoon to sit on her butt and be quiet.’

But
once Toth was handcuffed, the mother-of-three disembarked from her 
seat, telling the officer that she was a ‘US citizen’ and that she had 
the right to ‘stand on American ground’.

The report then described how Reese resisted him as he grabbed her arms to arrest her.

Toth is said to have made a verbal attempt to calm his hysterical wife.

The
officer’s report further details: ‘Mrs. Witherspoon asked, “Do you know
my name?” I answered, “No, I don’t need to know your name.” I then 
added, “right now.” Mrs. Witherspoon stated, “You’re about to find out 
who I am.”’

According to the arresting officer: 
‘Mrs. Witherspoon also stated, “You are going to be on national news.” I
advised Mrs. Witherspoon that was fine.’

Toth is said to be facing charges for driving under the influence and failure to stay within his lane while on the road.

While Reese’s alleged violation is ‘disorderly conduct (obstruction)', which falls under municipal ordinance.

On Sunday Reese issued a statement which said: 'Out of respect for the ongoing legal situation, I cannot comment on everything that is being reported right now. But I do want to say, I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said.

'It was definitely a scary situation and I was frightened for my husband, but that is no excuse. I was disrespectful to the officer who was just doing his job. I have nothing but respect for the police and I’m very sorry for my behavior.'
