Speaker's wife Sally Bercow is facing a six- figure payout for libelling a Tory peer on Twitter.

She has lost a High Court battle with Lord McAlpine over a tweet suggesting he was a child sex offender.

Mrs Bercow now faces a  crippling payout and legal costs totalling more than £100,000 after the court decided the  message was libellous.

The tweet – sent to her 56,000 online followers on November 4 last year – said: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*’

Libellous: Sally Bercow's tweet about Lord McAlpine during the child abuse storm was libellous, the High Court ruled today

She wrote it just two days  after the 
BBC’s Newsnight  programme wrongly implicated the former Conservative 
Party treasurer in allegations of abuse at a Welsh children’s home in 
the 1970s and 1980s.

Although the programme did not name Lord McAlpine, it led to widespread internet rumours that he was connected to the abuse.

The peer has already agreed a £185,000 settlement with the BBC as well 
as £125,000 with ITV after Phillip Schofield revealed his name through 
an on-screen blunder.

In February, he announced he was dropping defamation claims against 
Twitter users with fewer than 500 followers, saying he wished to ‘draw 
this unfortunate episode forced into my life to a close’.

Mrs Bercow, 43, has always insisted her tweet was not defamatory.

During the hearing last month her lawyer, William McCormick QC, said: 
‘It’s the sort of random thought, if one was sitting in one’s room with 
one’s family, you might just come out with but instead of speaking it, 
tweet it.’

But Lord McAlpine’s lawyers said the tweet ‘pointed the  finger of blame’ at him, suggesting he was a sex offender.

Yesterday, Mr Justice Tugendhat agreed with the peer and said the 
message provided her online followers with ‘the last piece of the 
jigsaw’ in identifying Lord McAlpine as the subject of the Newsnight 
documentary.

He said: ‘In my judgment, the reasonable reader would understand the 
words “innocent face” as being insincere and ironical. There is no 
sensible reason for including those words in the tweet if they are to be
taken as meaning that the defendant simply wants to know the answer to a
factual question.’

He added: ‘It is an allegation of guilt. I see no room on these facts for any less serious meaning.’

Last month, Mrs Bercow was directed to pay Lord McAlpine’s estimated £17,000 legal costs incurred during a preliminary hearing.

She previously declined three offers to settle the case, but has now agreed to settle the dispute for an undisclosed sum.

Her total legal bill, which will include his costs, will reach an estimated £100,000, insiders said yesterday.

Fame: In 2011, Mrs Bercow defied opposition from her husband to take part in Celebrity Big Brother alongside celebrity photographer Darryn Lyons

In a statement after the ruling, Mrs Bercow said: ‘Today the High Court 
found that my tweet constituted a serious libel, both in its natural 
meaning and as an innuendo.

‘To say I’m surprised and disappointed by this is an understatement. 
However, I will accept the ruling as the end of the matter.

‘I remain sorry for the distress I have caused Lord McAlpine and I 
repeat my apologies. I  have accepted an earlier offer his lawyers made 
to settle this matter.’

Lord McAlpine’s solicitor, Andrew Reid, said the peer was ‘pleased’ with the result.

He added: ‘The apologies previously 
received from Mrs Bercow did not concede that her tweet was defamatory. 
Clearly she must now accept this fact.

‘The failure of Mrs Bercow to admit that her tweet was defamatory caused
considerable unnecessary pain and suffering to Lord McAlpine and his 
family over the past six months.

‘With knowledge of the judgment, I am pleased to be able to say that Mrs
Bercow has finally seen sense and has accepted an offer of settlement, 
which Lord McAlpine made back in January.’
