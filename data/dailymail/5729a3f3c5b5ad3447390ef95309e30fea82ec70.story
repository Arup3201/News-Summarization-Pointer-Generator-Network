Bernie Madoff and his wife tried to kill themselves together while he was awaiting justice for his $60billion Ponzi scheme.

Ruth Madoff, in her first public comments on life with her husband, said they swallowed a large number of pills because they ‘couldn’t go on any more’.

The couple lay down on their bed next to each other on Christmas Eve 2008 hoping to die, but woke up the next morning unharmed.

Desperation: Ruth Madoff, wife of disgraced financier Bernie, has spoken for the first time about how they tried to kill themselves when the burden of his crimes became too much

Mrs Madoff, 68, said she and her husband, 73, had been driven to desperation by the abuse they received since he confessed earlier that month to being behind the world’s biggest ever financial crime.

She told U.S TV network CBS: ‘I don’t know whose idea it was, but we decided to kill ourselves because it was so horrendous what was happening.

‘We had terrible phone calls. Hate mail, just beyond anything and I said: ‘I just can’t go on anymore.’

They did not drink alcohol for fear of vomiting but swallowed a number of pills.

Disgraced: Bernie Madoff was sentenced to 150 years for his billion dollar scam

Mrs Madoff said: ‘I took what we had, he took more,’ adding that the fact it was Christmas Eve ‘added to the whole depression’.

But the plan did not work. She said: ‘We took pills and woke up the next day… It was very impulsive and I am glad we woke up’.

Before trying the kill themselves Mrs Madoff sent her son Andrew a package of sentimental items such as jewellery and when he later asked why, she revealed their plot to him.

Mrs Madoff’s disclosure is the first time she has spoken in public about life with her husband, but she is unlikely to receive sympathy with many of Madoff’s victims - or some of his own family.

Bernie Madoff is serving 150 years in a North Carolina jail for his crimes but the fallout on his family has been even more devastating.

Last December his son Mark Madoff hanged himself in his Manhattan apartment on the second anniversary of his father’s arrest.

He and brother Andrew had been the ones who turned him in but after years of negative headlines he was unable to move on, and took his own life at the age of 46.

His widow Stephanie Madoff Mack recently broken her silence and told how if she saw her father-in-law again she would ‘spit in his face’.

She added that she was still furious and accused him of ogling her when she was pregnant and being a hygiene freak.

Mis Madoff Mack's book, The End Of Normal, also paints a deeply unflattering portrait of her mother-in-law as so obsessed with dieting she would pour salt all over her food to stop her eating too much.

It also claimed Ruth Madoff has had two face lifts and would fish the carcass of the roast chicken out of the trash because she loved licking the bones.

Revelations: Stephanie Madoff Mack, the Madoffs' daughter-in-law has released a book about life inside the family

The book from Miss Madoff Mack is the
first account from somebody inside the family of what it was like to be
caught up in the scandal.

It
shows how despite appearing to be what she calls 'the perfect family', 
there were dark secrets – and extremely unpleasant personalities.During 
their first family holiday in Florida, Miss Madoff Mack writes how 'the 
two of them (Ruth and Bernie) spent the entire time trash talking the 
hired help'.

Since Bernie Madoff was jailed his wife - who has stood by him - has exchanged the lifestyle of a billionaire for a modest £200,000 flat in Florida where she hands out meals to the homeless.

She is also now so poor that relatives are giving her handouts and she has been reduced to driving around a rusty 14-year-old car.

Three years on Madoff’s victims have finally started to receive some of their money back.

More than 1,200 account holders earlier this month split the first $316million although that is a fraction of the $9billion that has been recovered.
