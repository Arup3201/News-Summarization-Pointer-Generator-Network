Doctors are still administering a flu vaccination that is banned from being used on children under five after it caused a five-year-old girl to become severely disabled.

The use of bioCSL Fluvax on children under five years old was blacklisted after an increase in febrile convulsions in children was linked to the vaccine in 2010.

Febrile convulsions, or febrile seizures, occur when normal brain activity is interrupted by a fever and usually it happens without warning.

Doctors are still administering the bioCSL Fluvax to children under five four years after it was banned of that use

So far this year, there have been 31 reported cases of the bioCSL Fluvax being administered to children under the age of five.

It has dropped since last year when there were 43 reported cases.

Australia's chief medical officer Professor Baggoley said doctors still giving the vaccine 'defies belief'.

Prof Baggoley said he had sent out letters to doctors and took other measures to inform them.

He admitted this year's figures were low, considering 48,360 children under five were given other suitable flu jabs last year.

There were also no reports of adverse events.

So far this year, there have been 31 cases of the flu vaccine used on children in this age group

The Federal Department of Health advises that the vaccination should only be used in children five to nine years old after careful consideration of the benefits and risks.

In response to the banning of the use of bioCSL Fluvax in children under five, the Therapeutic Goods Authority ordered all sides of the packaging be plastered with a warning that reads: 'Do not use in children under five years' in white text on a red label. Its product information pamphlet also contained a black box warning with a similar message.

As well as that magnets to put on vaccine fridges were distributed amongst doctors reminding them not to use it on kids that fell in that age group.
