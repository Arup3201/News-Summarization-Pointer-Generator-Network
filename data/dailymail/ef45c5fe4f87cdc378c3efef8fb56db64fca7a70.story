A Native American chief has called for a boycott of FedEx until the Washington Redskins - who play at FedExField - change their team name.

Osage Nation Chief Geoffrey M. Standing Bear wrote a letter telling tribal employees to stop using the service until the name is changed 'to something less inflammatory and insulting'.

'Other reports reveal the name Redskins is derived from a horrible former practice of removing the skin of Native people for the purpose of collecting bounties,' he wrote, KRMG reported.

His tribe added in a news release that Redskins owner Daniel Snyder 'chooses to stick with a brand which dictionaries define as disparaging and offensive'.

Boycott: Osage Nation Chief Geoffrey M. Standing Bear has written a directive to all tribal employees telling them to stop using FedEx until the Washington Redskins - who play at FedExField - change their name

FedEx bought the naming rights to the stadium in a 27-year deal for $207 million in 1999.

The tribe, which has 18,000 members, is based in Osage County, Oklahoma. But it is not the only one planning to boycott the services.

The National Congress of American Indians has spoken out against the name, while the Native Voice Network, which represents Native American organizations, has also targeted FedEx.

The Native Voice Network, which says the name has a negative, dehumanizing effect on children, told CNN that they supported Standing Bear's call to boycott the company.

'We're very proud of their position and we'd love to see other tribal communities do the same,' she said.

As well as owning the naming rights, FedEx's chairman, president and CEO Fred Smith is also part of the team's ownership group.

Patrick Fitzgerald, FedEx's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said the company is proud of its links to the stadium, which is used by a wide-range of groups. 

'Offensive': FedEx bought the naming rights to the stadium in a $207 million deal in 1999 - but now Native American tribes have attacked the company for supporting the team name, which they say is insulting

But he added that 'we continue to direct questions about the name to the franchise owner'.

Snyder previously said the name 'captures the best of who we are and who we can be, by staying true to our history and honoring the deep and enduring values our name represents'.

The owner insists that the name honors Native Americans, rather than disparages them.

The Osage Nation, which is based in Pawhuska, is among several Oklahoma-based tribes that have called on the team to change its name.

Those tribes include the state's five most influential -including the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole nations - that represent more than 500,000 tribal citizens across the U.S.
