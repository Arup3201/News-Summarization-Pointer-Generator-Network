A newly-revealed 911 call today shed light on a dispute between soccer star Hope Solo and her fiancé on the night before their wedding, which went on as planned despite the melee.

The November 13 fracas in Solo's Washington state home resulted in the arrest of former NFL player Jerramy Stevens, but the charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence.

Shortly after his release from jail, the couple married - a mere two months after they started dating.

Trouble in paradise? A newly-revealed 911 call has shed some light on a dispute between soccer star Hope Solo and her fiance Jerramy Stevens on the night before their wedding, which went on as planned despite the melee

The caller told the dispatcher that he was Marcus Solo, Hope's brother, and and asked that officers respond to her home, where a pre-wedding party appeared to have taken a violent turn.

The recording of the 911 call was revealed last night by KOMO News.

At the beginning of the call, he says: 'There was a little fight inside the house and she got thrown to the ground and she might have dislocated her hip,' referring to a female party guest who wasn't his sister.

When asked if any weapons were used in the fight, Marcus Solo said: 'A stun gun, actually.'

He adds that many of the people in the home had been drinking alcohol.

Marcus Solo, however, never identifies Stevens - or anyone else - as the aggressor in the fight.

When pressed about the person who started it all, he replies: 'We won't go there. Please get here.'

Police have previously said that Marcus used
 a 'stun gun' to fight off a group of men who had not been invited to 
the party.

When cops arrived, Solo was said to have been left nursing a cut elbow following the altercation. Others in the home suffered minor injuries.

Stevens was found hiding in a bedroom by
 police, lying between a bed and the wall. He claimed to have been 
sleeping and unaware of the fight, but his story crumbled as officers discovered dried blood 
on his shirt.

He was  arrested for fourth-degree domestic violence assault after admitting he had fought with Solo.

An officer reported: 'He and his fiancée
 Hope had an argument about whether they would be living in Florida or 
Washington after their marriage.'

A judge determined there wasn't 
enough evidence to hold Stevens and he was released, but the matter 
remained under investigation.

Hours later, Solo and Stevens were 
married. The couple wed at a farm 
near Snohomish, Washington state, in a ceremony that Solo's aunt Kathleen
 Shaw called 'beautiful'.

Her teammate Jillian Loyden, a backup goalkeeper to Hope on the U.S. 
National women's soccer team, was also a guest and tweeted: 'Happy to
 witness such an amazing celebration of real love.'

Solo herself uploaded a picture of her 
and her new husband in Seattle the day after the wedding, with Stevens 
clearly wearing his gold wedding band.

She spoke out about her relationship after a workout with her teammates in Portland, Oregon.

The U.S. soccer star has since maintained that her husband never hit her.

'I'm happy,' Solo insisted. 'I'm happily married.
 I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my 
life... My life is great.'

Stevens, 33, was arrested again at his Tampa, Florida, home - a day after the wedding - for violating  probation - stemming from a marijuana possession charge brought in October 2010.

A Florida Department of Corrections 
spokesperson told NWCN that Stevens' probation had allowed him to travel to 
Washington state, where he married Solo, as long as he did not get arrested.

Although the charges were later 
dropped, simply being arrested allowed a violation of his probation in Florida, the spokesperson told the news channel..

The probation stems from an arrest in October 2010, when he was playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was busted near the team's hotel after an officer found marijuana in a bag alongside his equipment, and he was placed on probation until October 2013.

Solo has had a stellar career with the national team, helping the team to two straight Olympic gold medals.

Stevens himself also enjoyed a 
successful sports career at University of Washington. He was the No. 
28 pick of the 2002 draft by the Seattle Seahawks.

His best season with the Seahawks was in 
2005 when he started a career-high 12 games and had 45 receptions as the
team won the NFC championship.

But he also was involved in incidents away from football 
that included reckless driving charges for crashing into a nursing home.

He and Solo, who also attended Washington, started dating following the London Games.

'Like I said, we're happy, and ultimately that's all that matters,' she said.

Marcus: 'Umm… A stun gun, actually.'

Dispatcher: 'OK, hold on. How many people are there?'

Marcus: 'There's about a half-dozen, not more.'

Operator: 'About a half dozen?'

Marcus: At least… Eight maybe?'

Dispatcher: 'Was the fight physical other than the stun gun?'

Marcus: 'There was definitely a physical altercation and an innocent bystander got hurt.'

Dispatcher: 'OK, and who was the person who was the instigator?'

Marcus: 'We won't go there. Please get here.'

Dispatcher: 'All the parties that were fighting, are they separated?'

Marcus: 'Yes, ma'am.'

Dispatcher: 'Are all of them still there?'

Marcus: 'I don't know.'

Dispatcher: 'Anybody using drugs or alcohol today?'

Marcus: 'Alcohol, definitely.'

Operator: 'And, the female - where is she located?'

Marcus: 'She’s here.'

Operator: 'Ok, but in living room, bedroom?'

Marcus:  'In the living room area, dining room.'

Dispatcher: 'What did this start over?'

Marcus: 'I don't know.'

Operator: 'Sir?'
