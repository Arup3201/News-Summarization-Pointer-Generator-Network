Question: Where do you take up residence if you’re one of the world’s biggest and most powerful owls, with a 6ft wingspan and talons like scalpels? Answer: Pretty much anywhere you damn well like, actually.

Unless, of course, you fancy descending upon the otherwise untroubled environs of rural England in search of tasty morsels such as cats, poodles, gardeners...

That is why the good citizens of Northam, Devon, were at odds with each other yesterday over a whacking great eagle owl called Eyeballs.

Scroll down for video

Friend or foe: The owl, nicknamed Eyeballs by residents, made regular visits to a man's lounge room before it was captured because neighbours claimed the bird of prey was attacking people and pets

The bird of prey, which stands over 
2ft tall and weighs as much as a small dog, took a liking to the 
well-to-do area near Westward Ho!

Locals nicknamed him Eyeballs after 
his enormous orange eyes and put out scraps to entice him into their 
gardens.

Occasionally you could spot him 
perched on a windowsill, and he even ventured inside, flapping around 
the living room of one friendly resident.

Bird of prey: It is believed that Eyeballs escaped from a sanctuary or was set free by cruel owners before becoming a local fixture in Northam village in Devon

'Trapped in their homes': Some residents claimed they were scared to leave the house or use their gardens as reports spread of the bird attacking a dog and a gardener

But some were not so keen. Sandra and 
Peter Morris, for example, said he attacked their poodle, Minnie. Others
feared he could harm children after he swooped on a gardener and drew 
blood from his neck.

Eventually, experts from the Owls-R-Us
organisation arrived to capture the bird.

But now police are 
investigating whether it was done legally after a complaint from one 
resident who claimed: ‘I saw the guy swing a net at it. I saw the wings 
of the owl flapping. He was screeching ... the net was quite small.

‘I was totally shocked and fearful for his safety.’

Captured: Eyeballs was seen regularly around the village before it was captured by experts at Owls R Us and taken to their sanctuary

Police investigating: One resident called the police after Eyeballs was captured, questioning the legality of the way the owl was captured

Police confirmed an investigation was 
being carried out into the capture of Eyeballs, a Eurasian eagle owl 
thought to have escaped from a nearby wildlife centre.

Last night the owl was being cared for at a Devon sanctuary and was said to be ‘comfortable’.
