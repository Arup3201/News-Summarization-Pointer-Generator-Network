When they bought a luxury holiday villa in Spain, John and Jan Brooks were looking forward to long, peaceful summers there with their family.

But their dream turned into a nightmare when officials told them the home had to be demolished because it had been built illegally.

After an eight-year legal battle to keep the £170,000 property, it has now been bulldozed. All that remains is a pile of rubble and an empty pool.

Destruction: John and Jan Brooks, from Taunton, Somerset, bought the three-bedroom villa on a hillside near Cantoria, Andalusia, for around £170,000

Destroyed: John and Jan Brooks bought the property for 200,000 euros which is around £170,000

Demolition: John and Jan Brooks' dream £170,000 three-bedroom villa in Cantoria, Andalusia, is bulldozed because it had been built without permission by a rogue developer

Mr and Mrs Brooks used their pension 
money to buy the hillside villa in Cantoria, Andalucia in 2005.

The 
couple planned to enjoy their retirement there but within a year they 
were told they would have to leave because the property had been built 
without planning permission.

The house was one of four illegally built
on restricted land in the Sierra de los Filabres, which were all bought
by unsuspecting British expats

Mr
Brooks, 73, a retired sales manager, of Taunton in Somerset, said: 
‘There are no words to adequately describe our anger at the greedy, 
selfish, corrupt creatures who caused this situation.

'It was beautiful and all that remains now is a dust-filled swimming pool.

  Attracted by the year-round sunshine and low property prices, thousands of retired expats have swapped Britain for Spain.

But scores have lost out to the country's planning red tape.

Helen
and Len Prior were left living in their demolished garage in Vera, 
Almenia, after their villa was knocked down. Their property had planning
permission but it was knocked down because of 'irregularities' in 2008.

Days later, officials demolished 10 more properties in the area - including at least four that belonged to British expats.

David
and Janet Hartshorn were sentenced to eight months in prison in 2011 
and ordered to demolish their home after it was built on protected land 
in Torrox, east of Malaga.

'It had magnificent huge wooden doors 
and a massive roof terrace on top where you could have had a party for 
50 people, it was so huge.

'It was in a stunning spot, that's why
we were tempted by it. It was our pension and a place where in happy 
times we enjoyed great times with our family.

'We feel so angry about what has happened. Now it is has been torn from the ground. Even the rubble has gone.

The property was 
built by developer Francisco Pedrosa who was handed a five-month 
suspended jail term last year.

He
was also ordered to give the duped expats full compensation. However, 
the couple fear they have no prospect of getting their money back as 
Pedrosa has since declared himself bankrupt.

Local
mayor Pedro Llamas also illegally authorised the supply of water and 
electricity to the home and also received a suspended prison term.

Ruins: The remains left after the British couple from Taunton, Somerset, had their villa in Andalusia knocked down because it was built without permission

Poolside debris: The three-bedroom villa cost the British couple £170,000. Now they will have to try and recover their savings

Splash: A man jumps into the swimming pool at the Spanish villa - but the property has now been destroyed after a court order

John and wife Jan, 70, a retired PA, 
first bought a home on the island of Menorca 13 years ago but decided to
sell up in 2005 and invest the cash in a mainland retreat.

They bought the house inland from Almeria for €180,000 and spent a further €20,000 on a beautiful kitchen and huge pool.

Llamas challenged his conviction but 
the supreme court upheld a two-year suspended prison sentence and he was
forced to give up public office for 23 months.

Remains: John and Jan Brooks' possessions lie abandoned on the hillside near where their three-bedroom villa stood

Remains: The demolition team were called in after a court in Almeria ordered on Monday that the properties built without permission must be destroyed

The local government sent in their own
machines to flatten their home on Monday and the remaining two 
illegally-built houses are set to be torn down in the coming days.

Campaigners estimate corrupt developers built 300,000 illegal properties during a ten-year housing boom in Spain.

Angry John said: 'We have no intention of ever setting foot in Spain again.

'Why should we spend money in Spain and give them the pleasure of having any more of my money? Never again.'
