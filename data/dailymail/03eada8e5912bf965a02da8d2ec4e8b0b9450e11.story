Anchors at a Missouri affiliate station laughed off a furry visitor and kept on with a live newscast last week, after a mouse dropped down into the studio.

The creature's plummet took place December 9 as Christian Bryant and Angie Bailey were on-air with Columbia station KOMU.

A loud background noise was heard as footage of Hillary and Chelsea Clinton meeting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge appeared on screen.

'I think we found our mouse. I think we found our mouse. We found our mouse, you guys,'  Bryant said, before a camera cut back to the studio showed him laughing.

Watch what happens live: A mouse dropped down from a ceiling into the studio as KOMU reporters were on-air

The anchors did not scream and did not appear to try to leave their desk during the incident.

Bailey began 'You would not believe -'

'We actually found our mouse,' Bryant said.

' - the chaos,' Bailey continued. 'You guys have never killed a mouse before I take it.'

'Oh, he is tiny, too,' Bryant also said.

'They flocked,' Bailey said while Bryant laughed. 'I'm glad Christian is still sitting here, otherwise I think I'd be in this room by myself right now.'

Bryant said during the KOMU broadcast 'I am immovable right now. I am a stone, you see it?'

'We're gonna do a little more news, but he is - he's right there,' Bailey said, gesturing off-camera to the rodent. 'We're gonna get him.'  

Look at him! Christian Bryant and Angie Bailey peered over at the mouse, which fell off-camera during the newscast 

Bryant tweeted 'Y’all, a mouse just dropped from the ceiling here in the studio. Tuesday just went from 0-100 REAL quick.'

Speaking about the experience, he told Newsy 'To my left, there is the reporter and the floor director. And you see this thing, like, fall from the sky, right. It just fell from the ceiling [...] And they just drop whatever stuff they had and just ran to the other side of the studio.'

'And it was this tiny, like, field mouse, and it had a long tail and it was brown. Uh, it was like this big,' he also said, gesturing with his thumb and forefinger.

Bryant heard about 'scurrying' sounds after arriving at the office, but didn't remember this before the mouse made its debut, he told Newsy.

Newsy reported that he also said 'everyone' thought he was at fault  because he did not ensnare the mouse, which escaped.
