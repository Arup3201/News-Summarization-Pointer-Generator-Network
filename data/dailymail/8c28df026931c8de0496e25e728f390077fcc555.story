He hears 'bruh', 'on fleek' and 'chill' on a daily basis.

Now, a Chick-fil-A manager has compiled a list of slang terms his staff are not allowed to use.

It includes 'bae' (baby or sweetie), 'cuz' (because), 'or naw' (oh no), 'ratchet' (trashy), 'guh' (irritated or angry) and 'fam' (loved ones, such as friends or family).

It also features  '3hunnid', in reference to the phrase 'Keeping it 300' - made famous by Kanye West - which describes how someone is '300percent real and honest' as opposed to the traditional '100'.

Blacklisted: A Chick-fil-A manager has compiled this list of slang terms that his staff are not allowed to use

The fast food restaurant manager, named Eric, put together the list of blacklisted words, before handing it to his staff with the warning: 'You will speak properly when you walk through these doors.'

One employee uploaded a photo of the document to the social networking site Reddit, alongside the words: 'I work at Chick-fil-a and Eric, our manager, is tired of our s***.'

According to the list, the words 'on fleek' (on point or really great), 'bruh', 'zero' and 'one hundred', 'fool', 'about a week ago', 'Felicia', 'Salty', 'Childish' and 'Turn up' are banned. 

The phrase 'Ebola' - the name of a deadly virus which has so far killed nearly 5,000 people and staff have apparently been accusing each other of having at work - is also considered unacceptable.

And the phrases 'I'm legally blind' and 'chill' (in its casual, rest-oriented context) are not allowed.

At the bottom of the list, Eric tells his employees: 'You are a professional so speak professionally.' He adds that crossing out words will result in no 'employee meals'. 

Chick-fil-A is a fast food restaurant chain based in the Atlanta suburb of College Park, Georgia.

Founded in 1946, it specializes in chicken sandwiches and has more than 1,700 branches across 39 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
