A British man was crushed to death by his own digger as he worked on his farm in Spain.

The 66-year-old died from serious head injuries after falling from the digger on land in Sella, near Alicante yesterday.

It appears the pensioner fell from the machine into a 13ft deep pit and that the machine landed on top of him.

The accident occurred at 8.25pm on Tuesday, and paramedics were called to the scene.

He also suffered severe injuries to his hands and legs.

Paramedics were called and he was taken to a nearby hospital, but was declared dead soon after.

Spain is a popular destination for Britons looking to move abroad when they retire.

Nearly 400,000 British citizens are registered as living in Spain, as of September last year.
