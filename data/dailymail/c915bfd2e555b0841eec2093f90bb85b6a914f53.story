A bargain hunter more than he expected from an auction when he discovered  $127,000 in bonds hidden inside a desk he bought for $40.

Phil LeClerc, of Weymouth, Massachusetts, found an envelope of the savings when he was looking through the dresser for a missing knob. 

He had bought the Governor Winthrop secretary desk at a Holbrook auction house on November 19.

Lucky find: A bargain hunter got a lot more than he expected from an auction when he discovered more than $127,000 in bonds hidden inside a desk he had bought for $40

A son was selling his father's home and furniture to pay for the assisted-living facility he was moving into.

LeClerc was searching for a missing knob that had fallen into a space between desktop and the drawers when discovered the white paper envelope.

'I banged the desk forward and when the knob came out the envelope dropped,' LeClerc told The Enterprise.

Inside was a stack of bonds that matured in 1992.

'The first piece I saw was $500 and that was enough to shake me up,' LeClerc told the newspaper.

By the time LeClerc finished counting the bonds, they totaled $127,000, he said.

Six were worth $10,000 each.

'First I said, 'Oh, this can't be real. This doesn't happen,' he said reports the Boston Globe.

'It was really a fluke that it was found. If I wasn't looking for the knob … I never would have found it.'

Upon realizing the value of his discovery, LeClerc contacted the auction house to try to return them to the original family. 

'The family had been looking for them for years,' Marg-E Kelley, who works at the auction house said.

The family which owns the bonds requested that their name not be used.

Governor Winthrop desks have developed a reputation over the years for hiding long-forgotten items in the secret drawers and compartments that fill the desks.
