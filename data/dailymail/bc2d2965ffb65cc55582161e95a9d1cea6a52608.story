The ex-wife of a music school director accused of rape gave a present to a teenage girl her husband was having an affair with, a court heard today.Â 

Michael Brewer, 68, is accused of 
committing a string of indecent assaults against a girl in the late 
1970s and early 1980s while she was at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester.

Mrs Brewer denies sexually assaulting the teenager more than 30 years ago and aiding and abetting her rape.

Mrs Brewer told Manchester Crown Court she had never had any sexual contact with the alleged victim who was 
said to be 18 at the time.

The jury heard previously that Brewer 
quit Chetham's at the end of 1994 after his affair with a different 17-year-old 
pupil emerged, in which he regularly fondled her naked breasts in his 
office.

Giving evidence, Mrs Brewer, who goes by her middle name Kay, was said to have given the AA
Milne book House at Pooh Corner to the 17-year-old her husband was in love with.

The book was said to have included an inscription 
along the lines of 'Don't worry about things, he is just a normal human 
being with all the same insecurities and doubts as you, love Kay'.

Mrs Brewer was said to have known 
about that relationship and on one occasion allegedly visited her 
husband's office where he showed her matching engraved watches he had 
bought for himself and his teenage love interest.

Asked about her knowledge of that 
relationship, Mrs Brewer confirmed she was told about it by her 
ex-husband 'a matter of days' before it became public knowledge.

'Did you understand it was a normal teacher/pupil relationship or something different?' Miss Baxter asked.

Mrs Brewer replied: 'It was something different.

'That he had fallen in love with her and that she was in love with him as well.'

She added she assumed the girl was 18 and that she understood it to be a non-sexual relationship.

She said she was in a relationship 
herself with another man at the time but that her and the co-defendant 
still lived together then.

'We had been married for 20-odd years and we had drifted apart,' she explained.

'We got on fine but the spark had gone.'

Miss Baxter asked her what her reaction was when she learned of Brewer's affair.

Mrs Brewer said: 'I was happy that he had somebody he was fond of.

'I think he hoped it would go on after she had left school.'

She said she could not remember going 
to his office to see the watches her husband had bought and could not 
recall giving a book to the teenager but conceded that was 'the sort of 
thing I might have done'.

Under cross examination by prosecutor Peter Cadwallader, Mrs Brewer said she did not think that it was possible there could be any sexual activity between the pair.

She said: 'That was not the way he was. I did not know her but I knew him.

'I did not suspect. It did not cross my mind.'

She said he was not the type of man to go sleeping around.

She denied she was aware that her husband was involved in sexual relationships with either the 17-year-old or the alleged victim in the trial.

Mr Cadwallader said: 'Even though you 
regret it now, in your 30s you sexually assaulted (the alleged victim). 
Is that not correct?'

'No I did not,' Mrs Brewer replied.

'And you aided and abetted Mr Brewer to rape her,' Mr Cadwallader said.

'No,' she said.

Mr Cadwallader continued: 'And you were very sexually excited about the incident?'

Mrs Brewer said: 'Absolutely not.'

'You were encouraging (the 17-year-old
girl) to get involved in a similar relationship with your husband in 
1994?', the prosecutor said.

'No,' Mrs Brewer said.

'Did you think that you might have the
opportunity to have a bit of fun with (the 17-year-old) as you did with
(the alleged victim)?' Mr Cadwallader asked.

Sighing, the defendant said: 'No.'

Mr Brewer was awarded an OBE for services to music in 1995 after he served as director of music at Chetham's.

He then became artistic director for the National Youth Choir and has also directed the World Youth Choir.

Mrs Brewer, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denies one count of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape.

Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, denies rape and eight counts of indecent assault.
