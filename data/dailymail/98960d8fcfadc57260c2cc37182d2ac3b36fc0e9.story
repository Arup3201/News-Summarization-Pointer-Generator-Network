Seven's Sunrise team has hit back at reports co-host David Koch was in the firing line to get axed from the show.

A story which ran in The Australian and was then repeated again on Channel Nine's A Current Affair suggested the presenter was about to get the boot in a line up change back in 2011.

However the story was rubbished by the Sunrise breakfast team on Tuesday as a 'big steaming pile of poo.'

Setting the story straight: David Koch hit back at claims on Sunrise on Tuesday he had faced the axe on the Channel Seven show

The war of words started with an article in The Australian on Monday, which detailed an email sent by the former executive producer of Sunrise Adam Boland while he was still working at the Seven network three years ago.

He advised getting rid of 'Kochie' and said reinvigorating the morning line up would potentially help ratings.

After the story ran on A Current Affair on Monday night, Koch, 58, was barraged by worried viewers, thinking he was about to get the boot from Sunrise.

Cruel comments: Kochie's use of the word 'sane' when trying to defend himself was seen by some viewers as a dig at Adam Boland's mental health issues

He addressed the rumours on the breakfast show on Tuesday saying: 'Well no. That (the email) was in 2011 from a bloke who had moved on and saner heads prevailed.'

Samantha Armytage added: 'Of course they were sane,' with the team laughing in unison.

Co-host Natalie Barr then got involved in the conversation saying: 'Brilliant minds stepped in.'

Koch said: 'He wasn't looking at anything because [Boland] wasn't in charge of this show at the time.

'He was simply sending an email with his thoughts. Thoughts that were rejected by those actually running the joint.'

But not all of the Sunrise team seemed to be happy to take the story so calmly, with his co hosts appearing exasperated.

On the defence: The Sunrise team laughed at the story of line up changes, with Samantha Armytage saying it was a 'pile of poo'

Armytage, 36, who replaced Melissa Doyle, 44,  earlier this year, rolled her eyes saying: 'I cannot believe that we have given this (claim) more airtime. It's such a big steaming pile of poo.'

However Koch's remarks were taken by some as a dig at Boland's issues with mental illness - he has struggled with bi-polar for a number of years.

The presenter used the word 'sane' and was seen to be mocking the former Sunrise executive producer.

He took to twitter to defend himself saying: 'In defending the ACA story I innocently used a common turn of phrase which has caused offense to some. I am sorry. That wasn't my intension.'

Armytage also posted an apology saying: Apologies to all about this morning's poor choice of words. My grandfather was bipolar. I would NEVER make light of it.'

The Australian initally ran the story regarding Boland on Monday - saying it had been given access to an email sent from Boland to Seven's then head of news and current ­affairs, Peter Meakin, and chief executive David Leckie, with a couple of other executives.

He outlined his ideas to reinvigorate the show saying: 'Sydney and Melbourne are already gone and we’re on the verge of losing Brisbane. We can’t be a show held up by Adelaide and Perth!'

New show: Boland was behind Channel Tens new morning show Wake Up - presented by Natarsha Belling and James Mathison

Boland, 36, was at this point in a senior role at the network and said the line-up change should be in place for the first day of non-ratings with 'new hosts, new set and new format.'

He said: 'It is my view the hosts should be Matt White and Kylie Gillies. I think Kylie has ­proven her star ability on TMS (The Morning Show). It’s unfair to judge her alongside Kochie.

'Kochie could arrange a breakfast radio shift for next year if we give him enough notice.'

The story broke on the same day ABC ran its Australian story profile on Boland - where he revealed he had considered committing suicide due to his mental illness issues.

The former TV wunderkind jumped ship from Seven to Channel Ten in March 2013 and was employed to revive the networks breakfast format.

Boland has struggled for years to cope with his bipolar disorder, a condition which sees sufferers experience extreme highs and lows.

In the program he revealed he had a mental breakdown just days after the Channel Ten launched its new morning line up - which includes Wake Up and Studio 10.   

Boland revealed he briefly contemplated suicide while in his apartment: 'I walked around the bedroom and I looked at the balcony and I thought: "Yeah, you know, here's a way."'

Instead he woke his partner Kenny Ang and told him he needed to go to hospital.

Following the breakdown Boland started taking medication for his illness and returned to work, but by January this year he decided he could not go on.

He told Australian story: 'It finally struck me, I wasn't trapped by Channel Seven, I was trapped by television.'

Boland's new focus is to find an identity beyond television and advocate on behalf of those with mental illness: There is a stigma and I think the media has a duty to help smash that,' he said.

'Mental illness is as valid as any other illness.'

Boland was in New York with his partner when the documentary aired.

He tweeted his thanks for the support he has received saying: 'Wow. Really appreciate all of the kind messages. And a special thanks to #australianstory for putting up with me. I hope it helped others.'
