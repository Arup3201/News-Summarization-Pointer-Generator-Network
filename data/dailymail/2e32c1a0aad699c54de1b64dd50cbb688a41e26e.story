The heartbreaking story of a baby boy who was found abandoned in a Sydney drain has sparked renewed calls for baby safe havens to be introduced in Australia.

Since the shocking incident emerged a woman has now been charged with attempted murder.

She has been accused of leaving her son in a 2.4 metre-deep drain in Quakers Hill in Sydney’s west when he was just one day old.

Campaigners believe that this is another example of the need for ‘baby hatches’ that allow parents to safely place unwanted babies.

Labor Senator for Tasmania Helen Polley, who has been pushing for their introduction in Australia for seven years, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘I’ve seen, read and cried over too many babies since 2007, no more.’

Found: The baby boy who was abandoned in a drain near the M7 in Sydney last Monday

‘I don’t know the details of this woman but for a lot of younger women, who hide their pregnancy and then deliver in a toilet, they need a lot of help and assistance. I think society owes them that,’ she argued.

So is rolling out a nationwide baby hatch scheme the best way to save abandoned children?

In Germany, Canada and China parents who do not want their child or cannot care for them because of poverty or their own illnesses - such as post-natal depression - are able to leave them in a safe padded hatch.

After two to three minutes an alarm is sounded to notify staff that a child has been dropped off, also giving the parents enough time to walk away anonymously and without fear of prosecution.

France has gone so far as allowing a mother to leave her baby in hospital for adoption after giving birth without having to register as the mother.

The storm drain, were a baby was found this weekend, was just large enough for the baby to fit through

Lorana Bartels, a law professor at the School of Law and Justice at University of Canberra, told Daily Mail Australia that while baby hatches are worth trialling in Australia they should not be ‘a substitute for proper anti-natal and post-natal care and appropriate child protection measures generally’.

She pointed out that Australia has its own unique legal system – one that currently criminalises mothers who cannot care for their children – and the country should run its own trials before introducing baby hatches nationwide.

* 2011 baby Willow found dead in a Kingston park, Tasmania.

* 2007 baby Catherine left outside Dandenong hospital, Victoria

* 2007 baby Joan left on the doorstep of a Sydney church

She warned that the hatches would only potentially be beneficial if they did not cut funding from other services for mothers who are struggling.

‘There is a hypothetical pot of money and if it doesn’t go to counselling it could jeopardise other lives.

‘But if baby hatches could be in addition to other services it is worth trialling. Not nationally yet, that’s overkill, but I would like to see a jurisdiction go ahead with it.

‘They would need an advertising campaign and social media so mothers knew it was available. Then they could evaluate how much it was used.’

Ms Bartels said in essence she is in support of change: ‘In case after case, women are quite overtly calling out for help… one women called parent helplines and said she can’t cope and “I can’t be alone with my child”, then she killed her baby and was convicted of murder.

The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child says there are baby boxes across Europe but Germany has the most with 99 across the country

‘That’s a failure of the system in my opinion, she was ill and she needed help.’

'We really need to be aware of the fact that the ones we see are the tip of the iceberg. We don’t know what the other cases are,’ she added.

Senator Polley goes even further in her belief that Australia needs to change the way it treats struggling parents and unwanted babies.

She first heard about baby hatches in 2007 when her youngest daughter was pregnant.

‘She said “mum you have to do something”, she was watching a US show about abandoned babies.’

Since then, Senator Polley has visited hospitals in Germany and Italy and been moved by stories about abandoned babies left in plastic bags and in bushes in Australia.

‘In Rome they have on average one baby a month that is relinquished and they have a specially appointed judge who adopts them out to loving families,’ she explained.

‘There was the Angel baby left at a bus station in Victoria who passers-by noticed but thought was a kitten, they didn’t realise it was a little boy. He lay in a morgue for two years before he could be buried,’ she said of the baby she cannot forget.

‘They are never going to take their first step, go to school, ride a bike… these women who are obviously desperate need another option.’

Some fears about baby hatches are that they could encourage women to abandon their children but Senator Polley said there is ‘no evidence that there has been an increase’ in the countries that currently use them.

So far no Australian government has supported the hatches because they believe they are already doing enough for parents.

Senator Polley argued that the scheme would be low cost if they attached the baby hatches to hospitals where the facilities to care for babies already exist.

‘You could have the legislation changed so these baby shoots can be in our hospitals, so there would be not any major costs just a case of changing laws so there are no prosecutions.

‘But we shouldn’t put a dollar figure on a baby’s life.

‘We need to do more… we are a wealthy country and the extra money on baby hatches would be small. We need to reach out to these young girls and stop them giving birth in toilets.’

What both women agreed on is the fact mothers don’t abandon their babies unless they are ‘desperate’.

Karen Healy, National President of the Australian Association of Social Workers and Professor of Social Work at the University of Queensland said that this most recent case of abandonment was a highly unusual case.

In China, abandonment has been encouraged by the one-child policy and a traditional bias for sons, who support elderly parents and continue the family name, leading to the abandonment of girls

'Parents abandoning their child is extremely rare in any situation. There would be less than ten cases of outright abandonment across Australia each year, but even among these this is highly unusual,' Ms Healy said.

'Babies are generally left on church doorsteps or at hospitals, in high-traffic areas where the parents know someone will find them and take care of them,' she said.

'Typically, parents will abandon their baby because of a complete inability to take care of their child, and very often they are looking for someone else to care for child but don't want to be investigated.'

'But this is quite a different scenario, and it's clear they wanted the baby hidden. There must be some element of shame, where their families weren't aware they were pregnant,' Ms Healy said.

'It has the hallmarks of mental illness or a serious drug addiction, and I can't think of another case like this.'
