Germany will travel to this month's World Cup in Brazil with only one out-and-out striker after coach Joachim Low cut Kevin Volland from his final 23-man squad on Monday.

Hoffenheim forward Volland joined defender Shkodran Mustafi and left back Marcel Schmelzer, still nursing a knee injury, as the three players left out of the final squad after being included in a provisional selection for a training camp in Italy.

Volland's exclusion came as a surprise given the stocky striker's physical strength and all-round play were seen as a good alternative to veteran 35-year-old forward Miroslav Klose.

Brave: Head coach Joachim Low is likely to play Thomas Muller in a more advanced role

'Obviously Shkodran, Marcel and Kevin are very disappointed and I an understand that because they had every right to hope they would be in Brazil,' Low said.

'All three are players who still have the chance to take part in several big tournaments in their careers.'

Attacking midfielder Mario Gotze played as a striker in the 2-2 warmup draw against Cameroon on Sunday.

Low, however, included Borussia Dortmund's Erik Durm, who can play as left back, in the final squad after he won his first cap on Sunday as well as first-choice keeper Manuel Neuer and captain Philipp Lahm, who are racing to get fit following injuries.

Little-known Mustafi, a surprise call-up in the provisional squad, made way for a more experienced backline, arguably Germany's weakest point while Schmelzer paid the price for missing too much training due to his injury.
