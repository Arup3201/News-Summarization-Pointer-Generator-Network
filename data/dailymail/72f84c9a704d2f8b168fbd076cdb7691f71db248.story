A woman accused of
taking her baby daughter from the legal custody of her father in
the United States 20 years ago has been  extradited from
Australia to face criminal charges in the United States,
authorities said on Saturday.

Dorothy Lee Barnett is charged with taking the child from
her ex-husband, Benjamin Harris Todd, in South Carolina during a
court-approved visit in 1994 when the child was less than 1 year
old.

She reportedly picked up the baby to take her to a birthday
party and never returned. The father had legal custody of the
child.

Barnett was not found for almost 15 years, during which time
she relocated to South Africa, New Zealand and Australia,
remarried and changed her name, authorities said.

Dorothy L. Barnett allegedly did not have custody of Savanna when she took her from her South Carolina father to attend a birthday party and vanished in 1994

Barnett (pictured left in the 90s and right 
in an artist impression) was located and arrested in Queensland in 2013 after she disappeared with her 10-month-old baby from South 
Carolina in 1994

She was indicted on charges of international kidnapping and
passport fraud in 2012 and arrested the following year on an
extradition warrant in Queensland, Australia.

An Australian judge signed an order for her extradition to
the United States last month.

The daughter, who is now an adult, supported her mother
during court appearances, Australian media reported.

The case received international attention from advocates of
missing and exploited children.

Barnett, 54, was booked into a Charleston county jail on
Friday, records show.

She is likely appear in court on Monday, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Nathan Williams said. He would not comment further.

Savanna Todd has remained a missing person for 
19 years after allegedly being kidnapped by her mother in 1994. Pictures of 
her as a baby (left) were used to create impressions of what she might 
look like today (right)

Savanna was by her mother's side during a court appearance last year when she was denied bail. She held a sign saying 'We love you Mum'

Barnett's attorney, Russell Mace, could not be reached for
comment.

The father, who reportedly traveled to Australia to try to
build a relationship with his daughter, was not available for
comment.

His lawyer, J. Graham Sturgis, said Todd has no part in the
federal case against his ex-wife.

Barnett and Savanna's father, Benjamin Harris Todd, separated in 1993 after two years together

Court documents say Savanna's father Benjamin Todd (right) was the one who lead authorities to find his ex-wife
