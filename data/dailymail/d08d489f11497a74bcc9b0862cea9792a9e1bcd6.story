A businessman branded his estranged wife a ‘greedy cow’ for refusing a £27million settlement during their bitter divorce battle, a court heard yesterday.

Scot Young, 51, a ‘fixer’ to the super-rich and a property tycoon who was said at one point to be worth £400million, now insists that he is penniless and in debt.

But his estranged wife Michelle, 49, is fighting a high-profile court battle with him. She claims he is hiding his fortune to prevent her from getting a sizeable divorce settlement.

A judge heard yesterday that he had told an 
acquaintance he preferred using cash so that Mrs Young could not 'keep 
track' of his spending habits.

Mr Young, 51, is said to have once been worth as much as £400million, but now claims he is penniless as a result of the global financial crisis and recession.

He was known to be a 'fixer' to the super-rich as well as a property dealer, and apparently associated with the likes of Simon Cowell, Sir Philip Green and the late Boris Berezovsky.

Mrs Young, 49, told the divorce hearing that her husband was worth 'a few billion at least' adding that she would be willing to settle for £300million as well as her legal costs.

Paparazzi photographer Dennis Gill told the court that he discussed the couple's situation with Mr Young outside upmarket Japanese restaurant Nobu in 2009.

'He said he would pay me £2,000 in cash tax-free if I would follow his wife on Friday taking a video and photos of whom she was with', Mr Gill's sworn affidavit read.

'I said "OK sure" and he said he would call me. Scot then said, "Between me and you mate, I offered her £27million and she refused it, only a greedy cow would refuse that."

'He then said, "What greedy cow would refuse that?" I said that was not for me to say. He told me to keep it under my hat and not to tell anyone.

'He continued chatting and told me that he pays for everything in cash so that his wife cannot keep track of what he is spending.'

However, when he was giving evidence orally Mr Gill distanced himself from his written statement, saying that he is deaf and may have misheard Mr Young.

'To the best of my knowledge, I did hear him say that, but I could have misinterpreted, because of my ears,' he said. 'It could have been wrong, it could have been right.'

But at another point in the proceedings, he insisted he was '1000 per cent sure' that Mr Young made the remarks attributed to him.

Mr Gill also told the hearing that Mrs Young, who claims to live in a bedsit and rely on food hand-outs, was lying about her lifestyle.

'I have seen Michelle at many of the most exclusive nightclubs,' he said, adding that he had seen her partying with TV star Donna Air, who is dating the Duchess of Cambridge's brother.

He asked: 'How can she afford to go to one of these places, and she is telling me she's broke?'

Mr Young's former solicitor Stanley Beller told how he fell out with the tycoon after a business deal went sour and the lawyer was later struck off.

He accused the businessman of taking £13million worth of share certificates from his office.

Mr Young, who had been a guest at the bar mitzvah of Mr Beller's son, repeatedly accused his former friend of lying, but the lawyer responded: 'I'm not going to sit here and be called a liar by this cheat.'

Earlier this year Mr Young was jailed for three months after being found guilty of contempt of court for refusing to reveal information about his finances.

The couple, who began a relationship in 1989 and had two children before splitting in 2006, have been engaged in divorce proceedings for several years.

The High Court hearing continues.
