Fears of a cover-up have emerged following the arrest of a young heir to the Red Bull energy drink empire, accused of killing a motorcycle policeman after hitting him with his Ferrari.

Vorayuth Yoovidhya, the grandson of the late Red Bull creator Chaleo Yoovidhya, is suspected of knocking down Wichean Glanprasert, 45, and dragging his body down a Bangkok street in the early hours of the morning.

Yoovidhya, thought to be in his late 20s, was taken in for questioning after police 
allegedly traced oil streaks for several blocks to his family's gated 
estate in a wealthy neighborhood Bangkok.

Toopgrajank, Bangkok's most senior police official said he took charge 
of the investigation after a lower-ranking policeman initially tried to 
cover up the crime by turning in a bogus suspect - the family's driver who allegedly claimed he had been behind the wheel.

He told reporters: 'A policeman is dead. I can't let this stand. If I let this case get away, I'd rather quit.

'I don't care how powerful they are. If I can't get the actual man in this case, I will resign.'

The story is headline news in Thailand where many are now speculating as to whether or not justice will be properly served.

One comment on the popular Thai website Pantip.com read: 'Jail is only for the poor. The rich never get punished.'

While a reader of the Bangkok Post suggested Vorayuth would  'receive a suspended sentence and never do any jail time.'

The Yoovidhya family was ranked the fourth richest in Thailand this year by Forbes magazine, with a net worth of $5.4billion.

Red
Bull creator Chaleo Yoovidhya died in his 80s in March, leaving his 
heirs a wide range of businesses, including shares in the globally 
popular energy drink brand, hospitals and real estate.

The family also co-own a company that is a sole authorised importer of Ferrari cars in Thailand. They have reportedly offered to pay for the policeman's funeral.

The Thai justice system has been 
heavily criticised in the past for showing leniency to the wealthy and 
those with political connections.

One recent case involving an 
aristocratic underage driver who killed nine people after her vehicle 
hit a minibus resulted in just a driving ban.

Yesterday Police Commissioner Anuchai Lekbamroong took to the airwaves to insist there would now be a full and vigorous investigation.

He said: 'Do not worry that the case will end up with leniency simply because it involves a wealthy family.

'The police will make the decision based on evidence. Everything the police do is being scrutinised by the public.

Following the crash a team of officers searched the Yoovidhya family compound and confiscated a dark grey Ferrari with a dented front bumper.

Vorayuth later admitted to having hit the policeman but claimed the motorcyclist had cut in front of him.

He has been charged with reckless 
driving and failing to stop or inform authorities before being released 
on a bail of 500,00 baht (£10,000)

The charges carry a maximum sentence 
of 10 years in jail. It is not known whether Vorayuth was over the 
alcohol limit at the time.
