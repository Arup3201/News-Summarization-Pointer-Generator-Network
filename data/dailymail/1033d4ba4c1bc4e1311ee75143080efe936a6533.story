Plans to tear up the official definition of child poverty will be put on ice today following a Government row.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith proposed that factors such as family breakdown and debt should be included in a new measure of children’s life chances.

But senior colleagues are understood to have warned that the move would leave the Government open to charges of deliberately changing the goalposts in an attempt to mask the alleged impact of its austerity policies.

Clash: Lib Dem sources said plans by Iain Duncan Smith (left) to change the definition of child poverty were blocked by George Osborne (right) amid fears it would lay the Government open to claims of 'goalpost-shifting'

Lib Dem sources insisted they had been prepared to back the plan – but claimed it had been blocked by Chancellor George Osborne.

One well-placed source said the reform was now ‘on hold’ and there is now unlikely to be any significant changes to measuring child poverty before the next election in 2015.

The current measure – 60 per cent of median earnings – was made law under Labour.

The minimum wage will rise to £6.50 an hour – below the hike to £7 suggested by the Chancellor – it emerged yesterday.

The Low Pay Commission instead recommended a 3 per cent increase, up 19p on the current rate of £6.31, from October.

The independent advisory group held out the prospect of further above-inflation increases this year, but there appears little chance of the rate reaching £7 by 2015/16, as George Osborne hinted last month.

Sources said it was unlikely the Government would overrule the commission to impose a bigger than recommended rise.

A Conservative spokesman said the rise ‘would be welcome news – a real-terms increase for millions of people for the first time in over five years plus the prospect of more above-inflation increases to come’.

In January, the Chancellor said he backed a dramatic increase in the £6.31 rate, delighting Tory MPs but alarming business leaders, who insisted it should not be raised by more than inflation.

Mr Osborne said low-paid workers should now ‘enjoy the fruits’ of the economic recovery. But Labour accused him of ‘misleading and empty rhetoric’.

In a further rebuke to the Chancellor, a source close to Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said it was ‘unhelpful for politicians to speculate about what the minimum wage should be’, insisting it should be left to the independent expert body.

David Cameron, Mr Osborne and Mr Duncan Smith have now agreed that reform would be ‘complex’ and further work would be needed to ensure any new system was ‘robust’.

The Government is thought to be preparing various measures to help the poorest in society in a riposte to Church leaders, who last week criticised its welfare reforms. They are likely to include moves to reduce energy and water bills, an expansion of free school transport and boosting of credit unions. Despite a  £170billion increase in welfare spending, Labour failed to meet its aim of halving child poverty by 2010/11.

In 2012, Mr Duncan Smith argued Labour’s definition of child poverty – based purely on family income – was perverse when other factors can be just as critical in determining children’s life chances.

He suggested broader ways of calculating child poverty – including whether their parents are in work, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt and poor health.

The Work and Pensions Secretary says the Government’s new universal credit, which will replace all out-of-work benefits from next year, will ensure the vast majority of children will be lifted out of poverty if at least one parent works 35 hours a week at the minimum wage, or 24 hours if they are  a lone parent.

Rachel Reeves, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, said: ‘Any attempt to change the way poverty is measured won’t do anything to help the children whose lives are being damaged by the rise in poverty we are seeing under this Government.’

A Whitehall source said Mr Duncan Smith remained committed to finding a more comprehensive definition of poverty but acknowledged there was no agreement on exactly what it should include: ‘There is a lot of work going on about this and that will continue, but it has become clear that there is no simple answer.’

Instead, Mr Duncan Smith will today publish a detailed consultation on a new child poverty strategy, spelling out action on unemployment, family breakdown and drug addiction, as well as reaffirming the Government’s commitment to ending child poverty by 2020.

Labour work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: 'Any attempt to change the way poverty is measured won't do anything to help the children whose lives are being damaged... under this Government'
