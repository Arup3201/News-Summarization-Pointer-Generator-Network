Liverpool face a ‘Group of Death’ next season on their return to the Champions League, with the Anfield outfit faced with the prospect of a group including Real Madrid and PSG.

Brendan Rodgers’ side will be seeded in Pot Three as a result of a four-year exile from the competition that has lowered their UEFA ranking — and as a result will be handed a tough group.

Trouble ahead: Liverpool face a Champions League group of death next season

Liverpool will also be drawn against a second seeded team, which include French champions Paris SG, Italian champions Juventus and Borussia Dortmund. Monaco and Roma lie in wait as two of the sides in Pot Four.

The easiest draw Liverpool can expect would be against the likes of Porto from Pot One and Swiss champions Basel from Pot Two.

Back then: Liverpool haven't been in the competition since 2009-10, where they exited at the group stage

Manchester City have been forced to tackle Groups of Death in their three seasons in the competition, but will find themselves elevated from Pot Three to Pot Two next season owing to their progression to the knock-out stages of this year’s Champions League and Manchester United failing to qualify for the tournament next season. As a result City will avoid another second seeded side.

However the Premier League champions-elect are facing a £50million fine and restrictions on their Champions League squad size and a wage limit for failing UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules.

It is believed a Champions League squad reduction could see the club restricted to using between 18 and 21 players. A normal squad size is 25.

Tough ask: Liverpool could face one of finalists Atletico Madrid or Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid (below)
