He's supposed to bring sweet treats at Easter time - but it looks like these children would be happier if the Easter Bunny just stayed at home.

These hilarious videos reveal terrified youngsters as they come face-to-face with the Easter Bunny as it arrives at their homes or parties to hand out chocolates.

But instead of welcoming the fluffy friend, their screams and cries can be heard as they run for protection behind the nearest adult.

Unhappy Easter: A little boy begins to cry as he's placed in front of the Easter Bunny for a picture

Too much: Eventually the young boy decides he's had enough and runs back to his parents

And it's little wonder, as some of the giant rabbits look pretty hare-raising.

In one video, three young boys are posing in their smartest, matching clothes for a photographer - until a lurking bunny puts an end to the fun.

Other footage shows complaining kids squirming in the laps of the Easter Bunny as he attempts to hold them to pose for pictures.

And in other videos, as the Easter Bunny runs into a group of children, instead of running towards him to see what he is bringing, they run away - certain he's hatching a plan.

Terrified: In another video, two young sisters begin crying at the mention of the East Bunny

Hitting back: A little girl lashes out at a toy bunny brought into her room by her parents

Horror: Another little boy cowers behind his parents for protection when he spots the giant rabbit

In other videos, there's no sign of the big bunny, but just a mention of his name is enough to make the tots scream and beg their parents not to let him inside.

And one particularly energetic girl reacts by punching a toy bunny, clearly distressed from previous years' introductions to the giant rabbit.

The hilarious videos were shared by the children's chuckling parents to YouTube.
