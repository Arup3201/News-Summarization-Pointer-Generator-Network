The Olympics are an opportunity for athletes of all disciplines to come together - and when the competition heats up, hormones begin to bubble over.

Now snowboarder Jamie Anderson, who took gold earlier this week in Sochi's slopestyle event, has admitted that the online dating app Tinder is 'next level'.

Anderson, who took gold in the event Briton Jenny Jones won bronze, said that she eventually had to delete her account to focus on the Olympics.

'Tinder in the Olympic Village is next level,' the 23-year-old from South Lake Tahoe, California, told Us Weekly. 'It's all athletes! In the mountain village it's all athletes. It's hilarious. There are some cuties on there.

'There was a point where I had to be like OK, this is way too distracting.

'I deleted my account to focus on the Olympics.'

Anderson, described by Jones as a 'hippie', described winning gold earlier this week as 'Kind of a big deal'.

'I think it's fair to say Jamie marches to the beat of her own drummer,' American coach Mike Jankowski said. 'She likes to do things her way out here.'

Tinder is a location-based dating app 
that lets users browse for prospective partners nearby. Users choose yes
 or no, and if there's a mutual match the app lets them know.

Anderson's frank comments come after fellow snowboarder, New Zealander Rebecca Torr joked that she wanted to meet the Jamaican bobsled team on the app.

Miss Torr wrote on her Twitter feed: 'It seems so far that not many Olympians use tinder.... Just wanna match with the Jamaican bobsled team.'

A
 record 150,000 condoms were handed out during London's Summer Games two
 years ago - 15 each for the duration of the event - and countless tales
 of raunchy post competition liaisons spilled out into the public eye.

Tinder wasn't launched in time for 
London 2012, but its gay equivalent Grindr made headlines after crashing
 almost immediately when athletes began arriving at the Olympic Village 
en masse.

Despite her initial disappointment, Torr's chances of meeting a match online have got a boost after her tweet was picked up by the Olympic Village Daily newspaper which runs for the course of the Games and is handed out to athletes.

'My tinder tweet made the Olympic village daily. Hopefully it brings me more matches and closer to the Jamaicans!' she joked.

And before leaving Sochi, she was granted her wish as she finally met the Jamaican team - although presumably not via Tinder.
