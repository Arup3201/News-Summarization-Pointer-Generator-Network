Sexual motivation: After nurse Simon Goad tried to coax a seven-year old girl into his car, police found thousands of indecent images of children in his home

A nurse has been jailed for four years after he attempted to abduct a seven-year-old girl while she was out riding her bike.

Senior nurse Simon Goad, 46, tried to entice the girl into his car near her house in Doncaster, South Yorkshire last September.

He approached her saying: 'You look a bit wet, get in my car and I’ll take you home’.

The terrified girl ran home to tell her mother, who looked outside to spot Goad loitering in an alleyway next to their house.

She took photographs of him to give to police, which meant they were able to track him down straight away.

Sarah Wright, prosecuting at Sheffield Crown Court, said there was ‘sexual motivation’ in his attempt to abduct his young victim.

When Goad, a nurse at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, was arrested by police officers found more than 8,000 indecent images of children on his computers.

They also found a video of him abusing children online. He had filmed himself asking three Asian girls, aged about five, seven and 12, to strip via a webcam while he performed a sex act.

When police checked Goad’s computers they found indecent images of children, some as young as four and involved in sexual activity.

When arrested Goad claimed to have been near the girl's house ‘looking for scrap metal’ and it was a coincidence he happened to walk down the same alleyway as the seven-year old.

Gul Nawaz Hussain, who defended Goad, said: 'Mercifully, the young girl does not suffer any long-term impact. I understand she is stoic and has made a full recovery.

Disturbing: The judge at Sheffield Crown Court heard how Goad had pursued the girl back to her home where her mother saw him loitering outside

'Goad is truly remorseful and full of shame. He had good employment and a stable family life, all of which he has thrown away.'

Sentencing, Judge Paul Watson told the nurse: 'There is another side to your character, a much darker side, which manifested itself last September when you attempted to abduct this little girl.

The judge said the images on Goad's computers were 'particularly disturbing.'

'There was a particularly vile clip of your interaction with young girls you were abusing over the internet for your gratification.'

Professor Hilary Chapman, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust chief nurse, said: 'As soon as we were made aware of the allegations surrounding Mr Goad we immediately suspended him.' 

'He resigned from his job as soon as he was charged.'

His role did not involve working with children and when we were made aware of the charges he was referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. He has since been removed from the Nursing Register.'

Goad pleaded guilty to attempted child abduction and nine charges of possessing indecent images.
