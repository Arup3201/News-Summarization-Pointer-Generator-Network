Luis Suarez was in a more cheerful mood in training on Thursday after his tears during Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace earlier in the week.

The Uruguayan looked in high spirits and shared jokes with his team-mates at Melwood as the Reds prepared for their final game of the season against Newcastle at Anfield.

Steven Gerrard was less happy, and 
looked in a contemplative mood with Manchester City inches away from 
completely taking away Liverpool's Premier League title dream.

The
 Uruguayan had to be consoled by the Reds skipper on Monday night after 
losing a 3-0 lead with 11 minutes remaining, and with it seeing their 
chances of a first title in 24 years fade.

Liverpool
 must win and hope West Ham beat City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday at 3pm to 
take the Premier League title and stop Manuel Pellegrini's side from a 
second league success in three years.
