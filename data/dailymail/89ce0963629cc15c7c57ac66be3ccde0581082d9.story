After a year posing for photographs at tourist spots around the world, Sam the skeleton is doubtless looking forward to resting her bones.

Since owner Susan Weese first came up with her plan to take pictures of the bag of bones every day for a year last Hallowe'en, the 42lb medical skeleton has visited the likes of Venice, Paris, Rome and New York.

And while the project may now be about to draw to a close, Sam and Susan, 57, still have Texas and San Francisco to tick off their list.

Cesar: Sam dresses up as the great Roman emperor and is flanked by legionaries at the Colosseum

Queen of the Adriatic: Sam takes a romantic ride in one of Venice's famous gondolas

The City that never sleeps: Sam appeared to be slightly overwhelmed when she arrived in bustling New York

Munch: Sam tucks in to a pretzel during a well-earned break on her round the world trip

Well earned pint: Sam donned traditional German dress and posed for a picture drinking a pint of lager

The pair set out on their jaunt on November 1 last year - the traditional Day Of The Dead.

Sam was seated in the passenger seat of Susan's car, a decision that was not lost on other motorists, who showed their appreciation by sounding their horns.

As well as a trip to the Empire State Building in New York, Sam was treated to a tour of the Colosseum in Rome, and even had a ride on one of Venice's romantic gondolas.

When the 
project comes to an end this month Susan plans to retire Sam to her 
studio as she has now become part of the family.

Strange customs: Sam has to fly 'over sized' and it has proved tricky getting her through airport security

Park life: After the hustle and bustle of the city, Sam takes a stroll through New York's Central Park

Not shy: Sam persuaded this young couple to appear alongside her in one of the snaps for the album

Spooky plan: Susan (right) came up with the idea for the photographic project last Hallowe'en

She hopes to get another, slightly lighter skeleton to take on future trips.

Susan,
from Albuquerque in New Mexico, first became interested in bones 
30 years ago when she worked on medical illustrations.

She said: 'Sam is 42lbs and if I carry her in my arms I get bruises everywhere.

'She
flies over sized, which is hard getting through airports. She got held 
up by the Department of Agriculture in Newark because they had to make 
she was not real bone.

'The only day I had to take pictures when we 
were in New York was a cold, rainy, windy day. Carrying her across the 
Brooklyn Bridge was no easy task.

'Most of my friends have been 
tremendously supportive. They give me and Sam lots of skeleton gifts and
some have opened their closets and shared interesting bits of 
wardrobe.'

Lazy bones: Sam is pictured wearing sunglasses and lying on an inflatable rubber ring in a swimming pool

Connected to fellow tourists: Sam enjoyed a taste of the Big Apple, wearing a Statue Of Liberty hat and posing with other travellers

Road to hell: Sam certainly caught the attention of other motorists, who tooted their horns in appreciation

Ball game: Sam even managed to take in a baseball game when she paid a visit to the Windy City, Chicago

The beginning: It is not known as the Land of Enchantment for nothing, as Sam the skeleton's exploits prove
