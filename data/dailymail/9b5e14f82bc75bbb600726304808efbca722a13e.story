The 'baby gap' is left after giving birth and is where the stomach muscles have separated

Approaching the end of my ‘fourth trimester’, I recently decided it was time to try and sort out my stomach.

Feeling brave, I force myself to really examine my new reality.  Once finely honed by Pilates with definition that I was inordinately proud of, I’m now left with a jiggling and sagging mess.

Determined to be kind to myself in this process, I shake off my discouragement and head to the gym.  Here’s what I find when I attempt my first sit up – I can’t.

Whereas pre-baby I could do 75 without breaking a sweat, now I can’t manage a single one.  My abdominal muscles are not just weak, post baby and Caesarean – they seem to have disappeared completely.

And I soon realise I am not alone.

Caron Bosler is a Pilates Guru who has worked with lots of high profile pregnant women – including a famous Royal she refuses to talk about.

She has created a new technique, called the AB Method, specifically designed to help post-natal women reclaim their abdomen.

She says, ‘The AB Method was developed when I realized how much pelvic floor control and abdominal strength I lost with the birth of my daughter Amanee Bham two years ago.  In fact I’ve named the method after her.  I have spent my entire life working out and am a former professional dancer, and yet pregnancy affected me far more than I anticipated.’

She continues, ‘In addition to the strain of pregnancy, on top of that, there is the whole process of feeding. And like most new mums, I constantly found myself rounded over whilst feeding and holding my baby. This throws the back into an awkward position; straining with the weight of a squirming baby.  Combine this with the natural Linea Alba separation of the abdominal wall and loss of pelvic floor stability and like many women, I discovered how easy it is to feel out of control of your own body.’

And Caron quickly determined that ordinary Pilates were just not cutting it.

'Whereas pre-baby I could do 75 sit ups without breaking a sweat, now I can't manage a single one,' says Ahsley

‘Obviously, Pilates was great keeping me and my clients in shape all the way throughout pregnancy. But a vital piece was missing to get back on the road to full recovery.  What I needed to do was form a clear pattern of exercises that new mothers could do to help this process.  A lot of mother's aren't aware that when the stomach muscles separate (Diastasis Recti) to make room for the baby that they need encouragement to go back together. There are a few simple exercises that with constant use and slow progression can encourage the natural gap that forms in the muscles to close.’

I turn up at Caron’s sun filled studio on Gloucester Road, sceptical but open minded. I’d trained with her before, but never coming from such a place of weakness.

The first thing she has me do truly startles me.

The AB method aims to close the 'baby gap' left in the abdomen by separated muscles

She has me lie down and attempt a basic sit up, raising my shoulders just slightly off the matt.  Then, using gentle pressure she guides my fingers to just below my belly button – and I feel a hollow space.  I can feel a gaping hole in my abdomen, an actual gap between my muscles that I can feel with my hands.  And it’s big. ‘That’s about three fingers worth,’ she says, ‘it’s significant yes, but I’ve worked with this before. Don’t worry, you can do this.’

Caron says that this ‘baby gap’ has to be addressed before you can really kick start your fitness routine.

‘The problem I found is that there was no clear way to get from the open gap in the abdominals back to full range of movement without the fear of reoccurrence. Unless the gap is brought back together, any abdominal twisting movements or movements bringing the feet over the head will cause the stomach muscles to separate again.

What I’ve developed is a clear pattern of movement initiating from the closing of the Linea Alba. From there we slowly add on the pelvic floor and postural exercises to bring the body back into full range of movement. Once the body is back in harmony then we can get back to normal exercise. ‘

And while I must admit that the yummy mummy tummy tuck has a certain appeal – I’ve learned it doesn’t address the real problems underneath.

Experts I spoke with all agreed that in a tummy tuck, even when the diastasis (or separation) is successfully stitched surgically, nothing has been done to change the strength, tone or function of the muscles underneath, which support the stomach and back.

And while private tuition can be expensive, Caron offers a special rate to pregnant and post- natal women.  She says, ‘It’s something I feel passionately about. I see so many women who are pregnant or just post baby and I know there are special issues there– and as a new mum myself, who is currently expecting my second baby, I’m really engaged in this subject. There’s nothing that gives me greater satisfaction than helping a woman during this extraordinary time in their lives.’

Start
 lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip width apart. 
Place your hands on either side of your belly button with your thumbs 
towards your head and your fingertips towards your toes. Your fingertips
 should be at least 4 inches apart. Take a breath inhaling. As you 
exhale, slowly pull your navel in towards your spine and push your 
abdominal muscles together with your hands.  You can do this exercise 
very soon after a natural birth. Repeat 10x every day.

Adding on

Once
 you have mastered the feeling of your abdominals pulling in with your 
hands trying to encourage the gap to close, add the pelvic floor. As you
 inhale everything is relaxed, as you exhale slowly pull the pelvic 
floor in and up as the navel pulls down and the hands push the muscles 
to close. Repeat 10x

Knee Folds

Start
 in the same position as above with your hands on either side of your 
belly button. Take a breath inhaling. As you start your exhale slowly 
draw the pelvic floor in and abdominals down. Continue to exhale and 
fold one knee in towards your chest so that the knee is above the hip 
bent at a right angle. Inhale to relax. On the next exhale, fold the 
other knee in towards the chest at a right angle. Repeat 10x

Knee Opening

This
 time start with the knees and feet together but keep the rest of your 
positioning the same. As you inhale slowly open the right knee out to 
the side making sure your hips do not move. As you exhale, slowly draw 
the pelvic floor in and the abdominals down. Continue to exhale and 
deepen the abdominals pulling down in order to draw the leg back up into
 center. Repeat other side and repeat 10x.
