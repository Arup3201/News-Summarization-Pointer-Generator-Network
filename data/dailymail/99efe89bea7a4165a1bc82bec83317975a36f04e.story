Target has defended its decision to only stock larger sizes of its new Lily Pulitzer collection online, not in stores, a week after an angry consumer backlash erupted.

'The last time we did this, it didn't work,' said Target spokesperson Joshua Thomas told Refinery 29, referring to poor sales of the plus sizes it tested with its Calypso St. Barth collaboration in 2011, which was also offered exclusively online.

Last week, one Twitter user, grownandcurvywoman, echoed the sentiments of many plus-size consumers when she tweeted: 'It's like Target is dating a fat girl but won't take her out in public.. that's how I feel right now.'

Eagerly anticipated:  Target's upcoming collaboration with popular American fashion label Lilly Pulitzer goes on sale on April 19, with sizes larger than US 18 available, but only online 

Responding to the criticism, Mr Thomas said Target was offering its Lily Pulitzer collection in sizes larger than US 18 exclusively online to 'try different things' and 'be flexible.'

He added: 'We need to take a measured approach in terms of responding to the guests.

'They say this is something they want to purchase; so we're hearing the feedback, we're seeing the feedback, and what I think is really important, we are responding to the feedback.'

Target had previously described its decision to include larger sizes in the collection as 'democratic'. 

Outrage: After being applauded for its decision to include plus sizes in the collaboration, Target later revealed the larger options would only be available online

Grown and curvy: Many plus-size fashion fans have hit back at the store's decision, accusing it of discrimination against certain groups of customers 

'They're really saying we only want 40 [per cent] of customers to be seen in store,' Sarah Conley added. 

The disappointing revelation only came to light after a customer queried a Target spokesperson on its plans for plus size stock of the collection via its Twitter account. 

'The question is, is [plus] size going to be sold in every store carrying the line or select store[s] of the standard online online,' FatGirl_fashion tweeted, to which a Target representative replied: '... The plus sized collection will be available online only.'

Just hours earlier, Target's senior vice president of apparel and accessories Stacia Andersen released a statement about the store's plans to include a selection of larger sizes in the limited edition collaboration, something which has happened only rarely in the past. 

'It’s really important for us that we can provide stylish apparel for everybody, and we felt like this collection was the right time to do it,' she told Fashionista.com. 

'They only want 40 per cent of customers in store': The plus-size community has been left feeling angry and frustrated at the news

Ongoing issue: It is not the first time that Target has been accused of disrespecting plus-size men and women

Disappointment: Some women have stated that they are sad to be missing out on the chance to actually browse the clothing in-store

'This project is so democratic. When we do these collaborations, there’s a certain group of people that always really respond to them. 

'But this, anybody can wear this. There’s just such a range that anyone can find something that they love.'

The statement was initially praised by the plus-size community - many of whom applauded what they believed to be Target's attempt to change the way it views its larger customers.

'This is a victory for plus-size women...' Plus Model Magazine's Marcy Cruz wrote online. 

'It seems Target is willing to try this and see if plus sizes will sell. And we think Lilly Pulitzer is perfect. 

'It’s a well-known loved brand that’s chic, stylish and fun and known as the mother of American resort wear.'

Bright and bubbly: The bold collection is full of unique prints and patterns

The best is yet to come: The collaboration will launch in-stores and online in April 

However, following the recent clarification about Target's plans to only stock the larger sizes online, many are now accusing the retailer of being hypocritical. 

'I'm excited about the offering but I'm really sad that we won't be getting the shopping experience,' Jeniese Hosey said on Twitter, before adding: 'I feel like we got served steak on a garbage can lid... like my Grandma used to say...'

This is not the first time that Target has faced criticism from its plus size customers; in August, fashion blogger Chastity Valentine called for a nationwide boycott of the store, after it was revealed that the retailer would not offer any plus sizes as part of its recent Altuzarra collaboration. 

'All I want is the clothing you offer all your other regular sized customers, but you always leave me out,' she wrote on her blog Garner Style. 

'With that being said, I have to end this relationship. It’s you, not me and for my own well-being and my self dignity I have to sever ties between us.'
