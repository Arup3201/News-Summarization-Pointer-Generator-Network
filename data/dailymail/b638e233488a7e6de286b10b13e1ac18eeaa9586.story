It was the playground of a psychopathic rich kid.

John du Pont inherited his parents' sprawling Liseter Hall estate in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, once used for rearing champion horses, and turned it into a wrestling camp.

Training America's Olympic team, the crazed self-appointed head coach made eccentric orders. For example, to paint some of the vast buildings pitch black.

In 1996, the once glorious property became the scene of horror when Du Pont shot dead Olympic gold medalist Dave Schultz.

The story has been turned into an Oscar-tipped movie.

And now the estate, too, has been given a new lease of life.

John du Pont's estate in Newtown Square, PA, has been transformed into a luxury complex. Pictured is the newly-constructed clubhouse

Controversy: The property, pictured in 1996, where Du Pont trained the US Olympic wrestling team was the set for the movie Foxcatcher

Shooting: On January 26, 1996, Du Pont (pictured left, foreground) shot dead his assistant coach, Olympic gold medalist Dave Schultz (pictured left, behind). In this year's Oscar-tipped movie, Mark Ruffalo plays Schultz and Steve Carell plays Du Pont (together, right)

Chilling: Du Pont (left) was ruled mentally ill and sent to jail where he died in 2010. Carell (right) is tipped for best actor for his portrayal

Vowing to restore Liseter to its triumphant days, the Toll Brothers razed the entire estate in 2013, losing Mr du Pont's mansion and the outhouse where Dave Schutlz lived and was killed.

In its place, the company has built 449 carriage and single-family homes in six clusters on the 200-acre estate.

Ranging from $600,000 to $1.1 million, they have attempted to maintain the original style in each home.

And the barn has been transformed into a communal area surrounded by tennis courts, a pool, and a gym.

'There are vistas that were left untouched, and you can imagine what it was like in the heyday of the estate,' the firm's senior vice president, Brian Thierrin, told the Wall Street Journal.

Communal area: This is the newly-transformed barn which is now a communal area with a bar and pool table, and tennis courts outside

New lease of life: This is one of the redeveloped properties on the sprawling estate, which range from $600,000 to $1.1 million

Restoring its glory: The estate was once a glorious horse-rearing farm with grand vistas and idyllic views from the numerous buildings

Old style: Using dark wood, paneling, and Art Deco patterns, the Toll Brothers hope to rejuvenate the original style of the estate

Enormous: This is a birds-eye-view of the landscape in Pennsylvania which was once home to America's wrestling team

It is a first attempt at rejuvenating the idyllic plains after Mr du Pont's erratic behavior cast it into a shadow of scandal - portrayed in this year's blockbuster movie by Steve Carrell, who is nominated for the Best Actor Oscar.

A bird watcher by trade, du Pont was enthusiastic about sports, and transformed his property into a luxurious training facility before scouting a world-class wrestling team.

With a swimming pool, shooting range, wrestling gym and accommodation for the sportsmen, du Pont lured Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz - played by Channing Tatum in the movie - to be his key player.

Driven to a near mental breakdown, Mark eventually left Foxcatcher Farm to coach at Brigham Young University.

After months of negotiations, Du Pont persuaded Mark's brother and coach, also an Olympic gold medalist Dave Schultz, to join the team in his place.

Quaint: This is the entryway of a model home, known as Weatherstone Manor, which is one of 123 homes sold on the estate so far

Family space: The dining table room of the manor has vast French windows looking out onto the former racetracks

Undeterred: The Toll Brothers said they do not shy away from the estate's dark past and that it has not deterred potential buyers

Traditional: The sleek colors of the interior are designed to reflect the grandeur and history of the estate that Du Pont inherited 

The redevelopment has coincided with the release of Foxcatcher this year. It is tipped for numerous Oscars including Best Picture

Dave - played by Mark Ruffalo in the movie, for which he earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination - lived on Foxcatcher Farm from 1989 to 1996, training the team.

On January 26, 1996, Dave was fixing his car in the snow when du Pont drove up to him and shot him dead.

Ruled to be mentally ill but not insane, Du Pont was jailed. He died behind bars in 2010 at the age of 72. 

The checkered past of the estate has not been masked by the Toll Brothers.

'You point it out, you don’t hide from it,' Thierrin said of the murder scene.

Six model homes are open for touring every day from 10am to 5pm.
