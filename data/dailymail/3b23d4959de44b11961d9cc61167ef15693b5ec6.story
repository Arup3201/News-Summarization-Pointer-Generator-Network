Shot dead: Maxwell Gadau lost his life on September 28 in Chicago after walking to a drug deal with a 17-year-old girl, who was also shot

A fifth teenager has been arrested by police investigating the fatal shooting of a Chicago high school student Maxwell Gadau.

The arrest of the suspected gunman, 17, comes just one day after four other teens, including two of the teen's friends were charged in connection with the death of Gadau and a 17-year-old girl last month.

The fifth teenager, who so far has not been named, was taken into custody during a class at Harlan High School after apparently being named by the four other suspects.

According to Skokie Police Commander David Pawlak, two of the four named suspects, Dzevad Avdic and Jeremy Ly were friends with Gadau and are being held without bond along with Myles Hughes and Nicholas Smith. They are all 19.

The arrests came just hours after a memorial service for Gadau and his mother, Patricia Gadau said the news had brought her 'great relief'.

'That to me is a blessing. On the day of his service, I know no other child will be harmed by these boys,' said Patricia Gadau to the Chicago Tribune. 'The community will feel safe again.'

Speaking to the newspaper, Gadau said that she was devastated at the 'betrayl' from her son's friends.

'It’s sad because I know their parents raised them here in Skokie to protect them from what we’ve been exposed to,' said Gadau to the Chicago Tribune.

During the first court appearance on Sunday of Avdic, Ly, Hughes and Smith, prosecutors alleged that shooting was a drug deal for marijuana that went wrong.

Patricia Gadau told NBC that her son was asked by the girl to go with her to the deal for 'protection'.

'Max went to front of the house, to the car, where they were approached by two men on foot and they shot him,' she said to NBC.

'She wanted him to protect her and he did, and he lost his life for it.'

Grief: The community of Skokie has been left devastated by the death of the popular high school student

Respect: Family and friends gathered Sunday at a memorial service in Evanston. in the north of Chicago

Prosecutors have alleged that Avdic was behind the robbery and Ly was the one who suggested they try to mug the 17-year-old girl.

They further allege that Avdic was responsible for the deal using text messages and drove Hughes, Smith and the 17-year-old arrested on Monday to the pre-arranged point where the shooting took place.

Gadau was shot in the back and the teen girl was shot in the face. The girl remains hospitalized and is on a respirator, officials said.

According to prosecutors, the teens smoked drugs as they sped away from the scene.

Gadau said one of the teens was even on the same swim team as her son.

An attorney for Nicholas Smith, Edgar Howard, said his client is innocent.

'He was just a passenger in the car,' said Howard to NBC.
