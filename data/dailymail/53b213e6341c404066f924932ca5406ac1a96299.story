The body of a man found in an esky by Queensland police this week is believed to be that of a  father-of-four from Napier on New Zealand's North Island.

Homicide detectives  discovered the body, cut into pieces and shoved into a large esky, in bushland at a house in Edmonton in far north Queensland on Wednesday.

Police have not publicly identified the victim but family members of Campbell Paterson  have told  New Zealand media they are 'just getting to grips' with the news and loss of their loved one.

'We are having a family get together tonight and will be talking about it [among] ourselves. It's obviously very difficult and sad for us right now, especially [for] Campbell's kids and wife,' a family member told Hawke's Bay Today.

A local 32-year-old man, David Hickson, was arrested and charged with murder and interfering with a corpse at the Cairns Magistrates Court on Thursday.

Hickson is believed to have known and regularly associated with the victim, according to the ABC.  

It's reported the victim had recently moved to Cairns for work, and had been  returning to Napier every three months to be with his wife and children.

Cairns Regional Crime Coordinator Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar says information received about seven days ago led detectives to believe the dead man may have been missing and had possibly met with foul play.

'It's important to remember that he wasn't reported missing,' he told reporters in Cairns on Thursday. 'We believed there were some suspicious circumstances around the potential this guy might be missing and we've launched it from there.'

He wouldn't divulge the information police had, but said the two men knew each other.

Det Insp Asnicar says police were investigating the possibility the dead man's body was moved.

He urged anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious, such as an 'unusual' looking vehicle or 'sounds of violence,' in the Edmonton area over the past two to seven days to come forward.

Hickson is due to reappear in court on December 17.
