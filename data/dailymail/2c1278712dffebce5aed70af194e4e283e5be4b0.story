Nigeria are implicated in another match-fixing scandal after an agent was filmed claiming he could rig matches in Brazil.

Football
 agent Henry Chukwuma Okoroji was caught on camera insisting he could 
organise games and certain outcomes during the World Cup.

The allegations, which emerged in a national newspaper on Sunday, saw Okoroji suggest he could arrange a yellow card for 250,000 (£40,660) and a penalty for 2100,000 (£81,370).

Plot: A Nigerian football agent has claimed that he could arrange a yellow card for £40,000 and a red card for £80,000 during this summer's World Cup

This comes just days after the 
National Crime Agency (NCA) investigated allegations that last week’s 
friendly between Nigeria and Scotland had been targeted. Speaking to a 
reporter from a hotel room in Milan, Okoroji and an associate — referred
 to as Joe — outlined their prices.

To
 enhance their credibility, the pair also invited Lazio and Nigeria 
footballer Ogenyi Onazi to the meeting, however, there is no suggestion 
he was involved in the match-fixing plot.

Okoroji
 said he had already recruited two Nigerian players for this summer and 
was planning to fly to Brazil to oversee his scams.

The
 agent said: ‘Hundred per cent, two players. It’s left up to you people 
what you want to do. You will pay for a yellow or a red card or a 
penalty.’

After making the offer, Okoroji rang a top Nigerian player and claimed he had agreed to take part in the fix.

But Okoroji added: ‘The player cannot come because of his career.

‘These things you cannot speak on the phone because the agents are monitoring his calls.’

Duped: Lazio player Ogenyi Onazi was prompted into coming to the meeting in a bid to enhance the agent's credibility. He is not thought to be involved in the plot

A spokesman for the NCA, who are now said to be investigating the claims, said: 'The 
NCA will from time to time provide operational detail necessary for 
public reassurance purposes.

'It
 does not routinely confirm or deny the existence of specific operations
 or provide ongoing commentary on operational activity.'

Last week an investigation was launched over claims of attempted match-fixing in a friendly between Scotland and Nigeria.

Thirteen footballers were arrested in April in connection with alleged spot-fixing and another six 
rearrested over the claims.

Despite the allegations, England are confident 
the game at its highest levels is clean of the scourge of match-fixing, a
 survey conducted by international players' union FIFPro has revealed.

Over
 1,500 players from eight countries - England, Scotland, Finland, 
Greece, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Slovenia - submitted responses to a 
questionnaire that tested their knowledge about the extent of fixing, 
approaches to fix matches, sharing inside information and betting rules.

There have been a series of arrests 
following suspected attempts to fix matches in the lower English 
football leagues in recent months. There have also been allegations of 
illicit activity in cricket.
