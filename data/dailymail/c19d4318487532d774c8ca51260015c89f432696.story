Younes Kaboul has been named as Tottenham’s new captain.

The Frenchman has led the side on several occasions this season and has now been chosen by manager Mauricio Pochettino as the permanent successor to fellow central defender Michael Dawson, who joined Hull last month.

Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and striker Emmanuel Adebayor will both act as vice-captains.

Adebayor made his 100th appearance for Spurs in Saturday’s Barclays Premier League draw with Sunderland.

The 28-year-old Kaboul joined the club for the second time from Portsmouth in January 2010 and has made 131 appearances in his two spells in north London.
