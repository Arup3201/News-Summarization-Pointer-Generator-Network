Shane Warne has questioned the psyche of the England selectors after they opted for Matt Prior ahead of Jos Buttler for the series against Sri Lanka.

Prior will keep wicket when the first Test starts at Lord's on Thursday morning, even though there were calls for Alastair Cook and co to opt for the Lancashire glovesman.

Former Australia spinner cannot fathom why the 32-year-old has got the nod over the youthful Buttler.

Safe hands! Shane Warne argues that Jos Buttler should have been selected in the England squad this week

Keeping his spot: Matt Prior will be behind the stumps when England face Sri Lanka at Lord's on Thursday

'I find it really surprising they have gone back to Matt Prior. When you are restructuring the team, why pick Prior and not Jos Buttler?' Warne wrote in his Daily Telegraph column.

'He has just shown how dangerous he is with the bat with a brilliant one-day hundred, so stick with him while he is on a roll.Â 

'England dropped him for a reason. He was not doing the job properly.'

Buttler's performances with the bat in county cricket haven't been enough to force his way into Peter Moores' squad.

The 23-year-old averages only 36 in the County Championship; but that shouldn't have stopped England including him, argues Warne.

'I hope this is not a teacher's, or should I say, coach's pet selection. Buttler gives that extra dimension with his batting,' he added.

'I played for Australia when Adam Gilchrist first came into the side. He was not a complete keeper then, but he improved and everyone wanted a Gilchrist, and why wouldn't you, because of his brilliant batting at seven.'

Too much to ask? Warne wants Alastair Cook's men to play an exciting brand of cricket this week
