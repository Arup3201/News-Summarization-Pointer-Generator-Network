Imagine being given the chance to embark on a restorative two week holiday  to anywhere you want in the world.

Now imagine you don't have miss any work for it, you can get there instantly and it costs virtually nothing.

It could soon be a reality as Paul McKenna has devised the world's first holiday hypnotherapy service to transform Britain's hungover workforce this bleak January.

Paul McKenna has designed the world's first holiday hypnotherapy service that takes just 20 minutes

In one twenty minute session  the world renowned hypnotist and self help guru promises to revitalise, refresh and restore your mojo by reproducing the feeling you get after a two week holiday.

Virgin Holidays and McKenna will launch the experience today, the day most of the nation returns to work after two weeks of overindulgence, and the time of year when we start longing for an overseas break.

McKenna will be delivering the bespoke service one-to-one in a 'hypno-pod' at House of Fraser Bluewater in Kent until Tuesday 6 January.    

After the session you will feel as though you have just been on a two week holiday

McKenna says, 'This is a truly pioneering experience and I'm so excited to be working with Virgin Holidays to help lift the nation's post-Christmas blues.

'Together we're going to help the great British public feel like they've been relaxing with loved ones in their dream holiday destination despite the freezing temperatures outside.'

He adds: 'The aim is to bring people round from the hypnosis so they feel as refreshed and revitalised as they do after a two week break. 

The service will launch 5 and 6 January in Bluewater shopping centre in Kent in a 'hypno-pod'

We'll simulate the feeling you get when the brain releases endorphins, the natural feel-good hormones often associated with a holiday. It's really a very exciting proposition.'

Mark Anderson, Managing Director at Virgin Holidays comments: 'This experience could not come at a better time for the great British public. 

Nothing beats the feeling of an amazing holiday, and we think they have the right to flaunt it even in the dark depths of January before they get the real thing later in the year.

'We know that the average British worker typically holds out until lunchtime on the first day back at work before they start dreaming of sunnier climes. 

'Last year we saw a 32 per cent increase in traffic to the site on the first day back at work after Christmas with peak browsing time at 12:43pm.'
