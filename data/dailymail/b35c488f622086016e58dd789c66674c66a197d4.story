A funfair operator and her two young sons have died after a fire ripped through the caravan where they were living during the winter.

Sadie Peters, 36, and her children - aged just one and six - were declared dead at the scene after a blaze broke out at 1.45am at a long-standing site for fairground families in Newchapel, Surrey.

Her 35-year-old husband John and eldest son, aged ten, survived and were treated for burns.

Mr and Mrs Peters belonged to families which have spent generations travelling the country to run fairs, according to the president of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain.

Tragedy: Fairground operator Sadie Peters and her two sons, aged one and six, died in a fire in Surrey

Blaze: The site was cordoned off this morning by police and firefighters as they investigated the fire's cause

Guild president David Wallis, 70, said  distraught members have rallied round the family and a permanent benevolent fund will donate money to the survivors.

'We represent 20,000 people overall and every one of them feels for the family at this time, especially so close to Christmas', he said.

'There is a strength in the community where we stick together and support each other. That's what we'll be doing now.'

The  site where the fire happened is reserved for travelling fairground families and was cordoned off this morning while police and firefighters investigated.

One neighbour who has lived on the close-knit site for 20 years, and asked not to be named, said: 'I was woken up at around 1.30am, I heard the fire engines outside.

'They are a family of five. Her eldest son and husband were asleep on the sofa when it happened, so I have heard, and they tried to save the family but couldn't.

David Wallis, president of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain, said: 'There is a strength in the community where we stick together and support each other. That's what we'll be doing now'

One resident said: 'Most of us are related - everybody knows everybody - and it's just a tragic accident'

'My husband ran down to help and said the scene was devastating. There was screaming and crying. It must have been horrible.

'We are a very close knit community and for this sort of thing to happen is just such a shock. For it to happen around this sort of time of year as well just makes things worse. We are all thinking of the family now.' 

Another resident said: 'I know who they are, obviously we all do, we are a small community and everyone knows everyone here.

'We are not related to them but there is a national grief. Everyone in the fairground industry knows everyone up and down the country. 

'We are just completely devastated. For a family to be ripped apart like that is just tragic. 

'We are all thinking of them and praying. I just can't believe what has happened. I am struggling to get my head around it. 

'I don't know how her husband and son are going to cope with it all.'

One resident of the site said: 'It's very upsetting. It's two small children and their mother. This is a big community of people who all get on well and they're all completely devastated.'

Another added: 'Most of us are related down there - everybody knows everybody - and it's just a tragic accident.'

Countryside: The site set aside for fairground workers is in Newchapel, Surrey. Parish councillor Graham Marks said: 'I'm very shocked and saddened. The residents there are part of our community. They support us'

A Surrey Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 1.37am on Tuesday 30 December to a report of a caravan fire.

'Three fire crews were sent to the incident and put out the fire using hose reels.

'Sadly, two children and one woman have died. A man and another child were also treated for burn injuries at the scene and the child has since been taken to East Surrey Hospital.

'Surrey Fire and Rescue Service & Surrey Police are carrying out a joint investigation and our thoughts are with the family and friends of those involved at this tragic time.'

A Surrey Police spokesman said earlier: 'Surrey Police and Surrey Fire and Rescue units are currently at the scene, which remains cordoned off while inquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding the fire continue.'

Called The Plantation, the site has been set aside for fairground families for around 30 years. It won permission to expand by four plots on the green belt in 2011.

A Tandridge District Council report in December last year said there were 72 families living on 38 plots, some of whom were 'doubled up' at a rate of two or three to a plot.

Backed up: Traffic waited to pass the scene as police and firefighters continued their investigations

Tragic: Another man and a child were treated and the scene, and the child was later taken to hospital

'Overcrowding is a significant issue', it said. 'There are significantly more families residing at The Plantation than the original planning approval allows for'.

The carnival workers were concerned there was not enough room to store their equipment, it added.

Parish councillor Graham Marks told MailOnline: 'They use it for a winter's quarters to educate their kids and repair all the fair equipment, then from Easter onwards they're usually travelling the country.

'I'm very shocked and saddened. The residents there are part of our parish and part of our community and have been for many years. They support us and any fundraising we have.'

District councillor Ken Harwood added: 'These incidents are always tragic but this time of the year it's particularly poignant. As a community everybody feels something like this.'

A Tandridge District Council spokesman said it had not found any evidence that the layout of the site had changed since last year's report.

'Tandridge District Council has no role in the management of the site which is in private ownership,' he said. 'The Council has no direct involvement in this investigation but will assist should the services of the Council be required in any way.

'We would express our sympathies to other members of the family.'

A South East Coast Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We sent two ambulances, two cars and three vehicles from our Hazardous Area Response Team.

'Sadly as a result of the fire three people were pronounced dead at the scene. We also treated a man and a child at the scene for burns and/or smoke inhalation.'
