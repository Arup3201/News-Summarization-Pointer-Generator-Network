A graduate student who shamed his insurance company into agreeing to pay his mounting cancer bills by targeting its CEO on Twitter has died.

Arijit Guha's wife Heather Ehlers set up a tribute page to the 32-year-old on Facebook, where his battle with cancer is described as 'spirited, graceful, and inspirational'.

He was diagnosed with colon cancer aged 30 and vented his frustration at insurance company Aetna on Twitter when he was told he had exhausted his policy's $300,000 lifetime limit - despite having at least $118,000 of medical expenses still to pay.

'Inspirational': Arijit Guha, who shamed his insurance company on Twitter into paying his medical bills, has died

But the firm eventually backed down and told Mr Guha, who had taken out the policy under Arizona State University's health plan at $400 a month, it would pay 'every last penny'.

A close friend told ABC News that Mr Guha had run out of treatment options and had been in hospice care for 'many months'.

Ms Elhers said he died at home. She wrote on Facebook that 'his life was one of love, optimism, joy, humor, and compassion' and described him as a 'rabble rouser, do-gooder, mustache enthusiast'.

She added: 'My heart is aching, but 
the pain is eased a bit knowing that he has the support of such an 
amazing community of people, so many of whom have never met him.'

'Life and hope': Family and friends have been leaving tributes to Mr Guha on the Facebook tribute page

Facebook user Naveen Rao, from Austin, Texas, wrote that Arijit's life story and what he achieved on Twitter 
would stay with him 'forever', and Mario Gastelum added: 'May his 
message of affordable health care live long. God Bless his work'.

Gregory Nickerson said he learned 
from Mr Guha's actions to 'defy convention and challenge the norm', and 
Richard J. Martin added: 'God Bless him for making a difference and 
standing strong.'

Mr Guha had revealed he was 'in shell shock' and was relieved when Aetna's CEO Mark Bertolini agreed to pay out.

The Phd student discovered he had 
cancer after returning from a trip to India. Stomach pain, which he 
initially thought was bug picked up on his trip, was diagnosed as stage 
four colon cancer a month later.

However, it was only after his diagnosis that he learned Aetna were to restrict payment for his treatment.

While he was still able to receive 
life-saving treatment, Mr Ghua had no way of paying for it and was 
facing potential medical bankruptcy.

He discovered soon after undergoing surgery and chemotherapy, he had exhausted his policy's lifetime limit.

Despite the law abolishing lifetime 
limits, under the Affordable Healthcare Act, this did not include 
student health plans until August 1.

Out of desperation and frustration, furious Mr Guha took to Twitter to highlight his case.

The company responded with this tweet: 'We care about members. We want you to be empowered to be healthy and make informed decisions.'

To which Mr Guha replied: 'That's so sweet that you want me to be 
empowered. Does [Mark Bertolini] care to empower me by paying my $118k - 
and counting - in bills?'

Other Twitter users waded in on the argument, many mocking the choice of words used by the patient.

One user, @Chris_Ashworth posted: 
'[Aetna} want you to be *empowered to be healthy*! They are denying you 
coverage to *empower* you. See?'

Another, @ItsLerema tweeted: 'My
 bud, a PHD students with Stage 4 [cancer] was shamefully kicked off his
 insurance. Btw congrats [Mark Bertolini] on the $10.6m CEO salary.'

Social action: Cancer sufferer Mr Guha used Twitter to highlight his frustration at the situation he was in

It was at this stage Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini responded to the tweets, denying Mr Guha had been kicked off his policy.

Mr Guha asked him: 'True or false: I am in this situation because your company offers a crappy product?'

And Bertolini replied: 'False. Why do you think the premium was so low? Do you look at your policy limits when you buy other insurance (auto)?'

The cancer sufferer then asked: 
'Moreover, isn't it morally reprehensible that you offer such a limit 
product? One that caps benefits so low?'

After a flurry of angry online exchanges continued between the two and their discussion then moved to the telephone.

However, the next day Mr Guha made the announcement via his Facebook page that Aetna had backed down.

Wading in: The online exchange prompted a series of angry tweets from other Twitter users

He wrote: 'Breaking news: Aetna just agreed to cover the full extent of my bills. Every last penny.It's a battle I never should have been waging, but things were what they were and I'm so absolutely thrilled we won!'

Before his victory with Aetna, Mr Guha had launched a fundraising campaign called Poop Strong - based on the cancer survivor Lance Armstrong's slogan of Live Strong.

He had managed to raise more than $100,000 by selling t-shirts with the Poop Strong logo on them to pay for any ongoing and future treatment - a sum he planned to donate to charity when Aetna agreed to pay his bills.

CEO Bertolini - a former paramedic - later tweeted: 'The system is broken and I am committed to fixing it. I am glad we connected today and got this issue solved, I appreciate the dialogue no matter how pointed.'

Mr Guha had told ABC News: 'I am incredibly pleased and in shell shock and trying to figure out what just happened. It's a huge relief.'
