Tim Sherwood is closing in on the Aston Villa job after entering advanced negotiations with chief executive Tom Fox.

The former Tottenham Hotspur head coach is understood to have been interviewed and expressed an interest in taking over from sacked Paul Lambert.

Villa are keen to make a swift appointment to spark an upturn in results with the side in the Premier League relegation zone, but also want a manager who can stay for the long term.

Tim Sherwood is in advanced talks with Aston Villa about replacing Paul Lambert 

Sherwood has sought guarantees and financial assurances from Villa 

Paul Lambert was sacked this week following defeat by Hull on Tuesday night 

That would appeal to Sherwood, who pushed for an extended deal during talks with Spurs chief Daniel Levy before settling on an 18-month contract.

Since being sacked at White Hart Lane last May, Sherwood has this season come close to returning to management at West Bromwich Albion and Queens Park Rangers before each move fell apart.

Sherwood has sought guarantees and financial assurances during both those previous discussions and is likely to do so with Fox also.
