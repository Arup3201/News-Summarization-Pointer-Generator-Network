Australia's cricketers have failed to honour the memory of batsman Phillip Hughes by sledging again, according to BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew.

The sport was shaken by the death of Hughes on November 27 after a bouncer hit him below the line of his helmet during a Sheffield Shield match in Sydney. He died three days short of his 26th birthday.

In an emotional funeral that was broadcast around the world, Australia captain Michael Clarke delivered a moving eulogy in which he pledged: ‘Phillip’s spirit, which is now part of our game for ever, will act as a custodian of the sport around the world.’

But Agnew has cited a number of flare-ups during the recent Australia-India Test series as evidence that sledging is again, regrettably, to the fore.

‘Michael Clarke said very clearly that Hughes’s memory would run through the team, and would be there in the way they would play their cricket,’ said Agnew (right). ‘Well, I haven’t seen evidence of that.

‘I really hoped that out of this tragedy might have come some good. But the players haven’t behaved any better, and I think that’s a real disappointment.’

Sledging was pervasive from both sides during Australia’s Ashes victory against England last winter. And on the evidence of Australia’s series against India, which they won 2-0 under stand-in captain Steve Smith, more of the same can be expected when the Ashes are contested again in England this summer.

Among a number of dubious incidents, Virat Kohli was hit by Mitchell Johnson throwing at the stumps during the third Test in Melbourne. The Indian centurion said verbal insults had come at him ‘throughout the day’ and specifically complained that Johnson had called him a ‘spoilt brat’.

Kohli recalled: ‘I was really annoyed with him hitting me with the ball, and I told him that’s not on. “Try to hit the stumps next time; not my body.” You have got to send the right message across.

‘I am not there to take unnecessary words. There’s no good reason that I should respect some people when they are not respecting me.’

Indian great Sunil Gavaskar blamed his compatriots, three of whom were fined for poor behaviour. He said, reproachfully, that the Indians had ‘started it’ but it had ‘backfired’.

Former Australian star Ian Healy agreed that the bad blood was ‘out of control’.

Agnew, a consistent and outspoken opponent of sledging, which he believes tarnishes the spirit of cricket, added: ‘It’s all you hear on a cricket field — “Knock his head off, knock his head off.”

‘Cricket has gone too far. It shouldn’t be posturing, abusing.

Jonathan Agnew believes Australia's cricketers have failed to honour the memory of Phillip Hughes

‘I know there has been a lot of bad blood between Australia and India for some years now, but it was an opportunity. I have that Michael Clarke speech tucked away ready to throw at the Australians.

‘If this is really how you feel, then let’s see how you play.’

Agnew recognises the need for aggressive bowling. He told the Radio Times: ‘The bouncer shouldn’t be banned. Hitting batsmen, I’m afraid, is part of the game. But it’s the histrionics, the nonsense, the prancing, the in-your-face nastiness. It’s become accepted, and actually it’s not acceptable at all.

‘The comments Michael Clarke made, I thought, summed up how people felt at the time about the way that cricket should be played.

‘The onus is on Australia to lead the way, and for others to grasp the opportunity. We owe it to Phillip Hughes.’

Meanwhile, former England one-day captain Adam Hollioake has questioned the ECB’s ability to plan properly for a World Cup. Speaking to The Times, Hollioake also criticised selectors for overlooking Ben Stokes.

‘Stokes, how does that guy not make it to a World Cup squad?’ said Hollioake.

‘He plays in my team every day of the week even if he scores 10 ducks in a row. He can bat, he can bowl. He’s a good cricketer. End of story.

‘England has the best one-day players in the world, we’ve got the best system, the best everything.

‘But we just don’t know a good player from a bad one.

‘The fixtures are mapped out years in advance. The chance is there to identify people, give them a run, and let them get used to the conditions. You should be able to plan it.’

Ben Stokes should not have been overlooked by selectors, says Adam Hollioake
