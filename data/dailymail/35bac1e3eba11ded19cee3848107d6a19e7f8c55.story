Geelong football player Mathew Stokes has slammed Prime Minister Tony Abbott in an open letter for 'isolating' Indigenous Australians with his remark about the 'lifestyle choices' of remote communities.

In his comment, published on his Victorian club's website on Friday morning, the 30-year-old  noted that while he did not think Mr Abbott was 'deliberately being racist', he believed that 'one comment from someone in such a powerful position can cause so much damage'.

'His words have isolated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders even more than they are already,' Stokes wrote.

The letter comes after Mr Abbott voiced his support for the closure of over 100 remote Aboriginal communities across Western Australia earlier this month.

'It's the job of the taxpayer to provide reasonable services in a reasonable way, indeed to provide high quality services in a reasonable way,' he told ABC Radio in Kalgoorlie.

'What we can't do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices if those lifestyle choices are not conducive to the kind of full participation in Australian society that everyone should have.'

The comment sparked a furious response from the Labor Party, The Greens and Indigenous leaders such as Noel Pearson who branded it 'racist', disrespectful and 'ignorant'.

Stokes has now added his voice to the debate after being disappointed by discussions amongst his own teammates following the highly controversial remark.

'The comments from my circle of mates ranged from ignorance, misinformed and that old Australian way of using humour to get away with some pretty offensive statements,' Stokes wrote.

'I thought to myself at the time, if that is coming from the mouths of my mates – many who are educated and have some understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues - imagine the conversations going on at smoko all over the country!'

'So my open letter today is not about politics, or a commentary on what we as a country do right or wrong. It's not about past decisions made, dollars spent or programs funded. It's about the damage caused by one single statement. It's about the disharmony that can come from one man's words.'

He went on to question how the comment would reflect back on Australia, saying 'for him to make the remarks he did, as the leader of our country – what must the world think of us?'

Stokes also reflected on his own experience of growing up as an Indigenous Australian, admitting that while he had not been on the receiving end of much racism, he empathised with those who had

'We have such a divide from our First Australians and comments like this have ability to drive us further apart.

'I am a strong supporter of the work being done to close the health gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous Australians and there is much great work being done, but comments like those made recently by our PM only serve to empower the ugly side of our society.'
