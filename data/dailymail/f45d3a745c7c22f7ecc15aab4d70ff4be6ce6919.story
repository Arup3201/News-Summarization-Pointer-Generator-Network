Oil leaking from a ruptured pipeline exploded in an eastern Chinese port city, killing at least 35 people, injuring 166 and contaminating the sea in one of the country's worst industrial accidents of the year

The leaked oil triggered two massive blasts, one of them tearing up concrete along a city road in Qingdao.

Photos posted online showed ripped slabs of pavement, bodies, overturned vehicles and shattered windows in nearby buildings.

Black smoke rose above gigantic fuel silos and darkened much of the sky.

The pipeline owned by China's largest oil refiner, Sinopec, ruptured early Friday and leaked for about 15 minutes onto a street and into the sea before it was shut off.

Hours later, as workers cleaned up the spill, the oil caught fire and exploded in two locations, the city government said.

One eyewitness told Beijing News that he was driving past Qingdao's Huangdao 
district when he felt the force of the blasts, and then realized the 
ground had fractured.

The air was pungent, many cars on 
both sides of the road were overturned and there was dark smoke rising 
in the distance, he said.

'It felt like an earthquake, and I was dumbstruck,' he said, adding there was chaos on the street as people ran, panicking, in all directions.

Authorities have ruled out terrorism, but the incident remains under investigation.

According to state TV broadcaster CCTV, President Xi Jinping has urged local officials to find anyone missing, treat the injured and find the cause of the accident.

A statement from Sinopec said: 'We will investigate the incident with responsibility and give timely reports.'

The Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau said barriers had been set up to contain the oil as it spread into the sea, but a mixture of gas and oil from a storm sewer exploded and caught fire.

More than 32,000sq ft of sea surface was contaminated, the city government said.

Authorities said the oil had seeped into underground utility pipes, which could have been a factor in the blasts, but they did not elaborate.

They assured the public that the explosions did not affect any petrochemical plant or military facilities in the seaside district and that air quality remained good after the disaster.

The accident is likely to add to growing concerns among the Chinese public about safety and the environmental risks that come with oil pipeline projects.

It is China's third deadliest industrial accident this year, following a chicken factory fire in June in Jilin that killed 121 and a mining accident in March, also in Jilin, that killed 36.
