A Chinese camera shop almost brought a city to a standstill after hiring a group of young girls  wearing bikinis to do the cleaning.

Dozens of men rushed to get a look at the girls who stripped off to clean windows and floors at the Golden Eagle Nikon flagship store in Taiyuan, the capital of North China's Shanxi province.

Professional photographers as well as passers-by stopped to take pictures and a crowd quickly grew on the street, the People's Daily Online reported.

The girls hold mops and brooms before being sent off to clean the store as part of the PR stunt 

According to the owner, the stunt was specially designed to attract the attention of as many people as possible and hoped that it would bring good business and interest in the process.

Store manager Jin Yeh said: 'I wanted the store to look clean and fresh to make a good opening on our first batch of customers and for the media. 

'But of course we are a camera shop and photographers like to have good things to photograph, so I wanted to have some models here as well to pose for them.

'From that point, it was a simple matter to decide to combine the two, I had the shop cleaned up, pretty girls for amateur photographers to photo.'

The third floor of the building has the facilities to enable photography lectures and training as well as exhibitions to take place as well as a centre of planning for large scale photography events.

This joint venture between the training centre and Nikon was signed in July 2014 and its aim is to provide provincial photography enthusiasts especially media photographers an important platform for their work to be exhibited. This cooperation creates a truly interactive media business.

The Visual Director of the training centre, Liu Yu, the general manager of the Golden Eagle store, Li Hang, as well as almost 100 freelance photographers from the Shanxi News Network all showed up. 

The manager said he wanted the store to look as clean as possible but also wanted something for visitors to take pictures of
