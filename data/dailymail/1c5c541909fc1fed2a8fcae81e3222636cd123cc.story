Porsche is replacing the engines of all of its £100,000 current model 911 GT3 supercars after two of the 200mph vehicles caught fire.

It has told hundreds of wealthy and celebrity owners - including BBC Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond - to stop driving the cars because of the blaze risk while the engines are replaced.

The multi-million pound engine replacement announcement follows Porsche’s decision last month to warn the drivers of all 785 of the model year 2014 911 GT3 cars produced of the fire risk. That includes 160 in the UK of which 60 are still to be delivered.

But it is understood deliveries of up to a further 1,000 of the two-seater sports cars world-wide have been halted while the engines are replaced, making nearly 1,800 vehicles affected in total – nearly £200million’s worth of vehicles at showroom prices.

In Britain alone the tally of cars affected will top £16million.

Top Gear presenter Mr Hammond, nicknamed 'Hamster', recently wrote of his love for the GT3, saying it was 'so good, I had to buy one myself'.

Road-testing the vehicle he noted: 'There are no bad points about this car'.

Porsche’s engine replacement programme came after the Stuttgart-based car-firm said it investigated two engine fires in which a loosened fastener caused oil to leak, which then caught fire.

The two fires happened in Italy and in Switzerland but no one was injured, said a Porsche official.

The GT3 is the sportiest of the 16 variants of the Porsche 911s on sale and is often driven by their owners on race tracks at special ‘track days’. Other 911 models and variants are not affected, said Porsche.

Porsche, part of the giant German Volkswagen group, said it is cooperating with regulators in the recall and engine replacements, and is in touch with each customer who owns one of the affected vehicles.

Porsche did not say how much it will cost to replace the 785 engines. The new engines will have ‘optimized fasteners’ said the company.

The Porsche 911 GT3 went on sale at the end of last year and has a UK list price of £100,540. It has a top speed of 196mph and can accelerate from rest to 62 mph in just 3.5 seconds

A Porshe UK spokesman said: ‘As far as the cost of an engine is concerned, we're unable to give a definitive figure as it will vary according to each situation, such as how much needs replacing, labour costs and so on. But as far as Porsche is concerned, we don't put a price on our customers' safety and our engineering reputation.’

In a statement Porsche in Stuttgart said: ‘Sports car manufacturer Porsche will be replacing the engines of all 911 GT3 vehicles of model year 2014. This is the corrective action derived from intensive internal analyses that were initiated in response to two engine fires.

‘Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that engine damage resulted from a loosened screw joint on the connecting rod. The loose connecting rod damaged the crankcase, which in both cases led to leakage of oil which then ignited.’

Porsche said: ‘After becoming aware of the two accident cases, Porsche promptly took action to avoid any risk to customers by advising them to cease using the affected 785 vehicles until further notice and have them picked up by a Porsche Centre.

‘Now, engines with optimised screw fittings will be used in all Porsche 911 GT3 vehicles of model year 2014 – including in those that have not been delivered yet.

‘The relevant Porsche Centres are in direct communication with customers worldwide to discuss the further course of action.

‘Porsche points out that no other 911 models or other model series are affected by this action.’

Of the 785 GT3 models that will have engines replaced, about 400 were shipped to the United States, and about half of those have been sold.

It has a base price of about $131,000 (94,200 euros) in the United States and about 137,000 euros ($191,000) in Europe.
