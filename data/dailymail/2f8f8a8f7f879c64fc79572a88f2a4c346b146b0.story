Denis Napthine has announced he will step down as leader of the Liberal party after taking his government to a loss in Saturday's Victorian election.

At the end of his concession speech, Dr Napthine announced he would call a meeting of the Liberal party where he would stand down as leader.

'I can say that it is time for me to step down as leader,' he said. 'It is time for renewal, it is time for change.'

Victorian Premier Denis Napthine concedes defeat  in the Victorian state election in Melbourne and announces he will step down as leader of the Liberal party

'I believe the party has plenty of opportunity to choose a new leader for a new future so that the Liberal Party will continue to be a strong, dynamic political force here in Victoria.'

Michael O'Brien and Matthew Guy are the two most likely contenders to succeed Dr Napthine.

'Those two have been excellent ministers, both as Treasurer and as Planning Minister,' Liberal MP Mary Wooldridge told the ABC. 

The results make the Napthine Coalition  Victoria's first government in 59 years to be kicked out after just one term in office. The last government that failed to win re-election in the state was Labor, defeated in 1955.

And while more than a million pre-poll votes are still to be counted, Denis Napthine conceded the  the figures show a Labor win.

'The figures clearly indicate that there has been a swing to the Labor Party and they will have a majority in the legislative assembly,' Dr Napthine said in his concession speech. 

'Therefore, it's appropriate for myself as leader of the government, as leader of the Liberal Party, to do the right thing by the people of Victoria and to contact Mr Andrews and inform him that I have conceded that he has won this election and we congratulate Mr And Andrews on that victory.'
