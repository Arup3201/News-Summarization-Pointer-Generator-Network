If you’re considering booking the holiday of a lifetime to New York, Australia or Dubai you might want to think twice before choosing this travel agency.

Online review site TripAdvisor has been flooded with furious holidaymakers who have received poor treatment at the hands of Blue Skies Travel (UK) Ltd, which also shares its phone number with Bright Skies Travel and Fly Vacations.

On the most recent discussion thread about the company on TripAdvisor, started on September 7 2014, there have already been 117 posts, few of them positive. 

Cry for help: Upset customers who booked through Blue Skies Travel (UK) Ltd are complaining on TripAdvisor

Thomas D from Belfast says, ‘Do not book with this Travel Agents!!!!!! We are due to leave on Sunday 26th October and we still have no holiday booked! When querying with Clive he sent us over a confirmation of a reservation for flights. 

'I spoke directly to United airlines who confirmed that infact all he did was reserve it and not paid for our flights!!! and after numerous calls and emails Clive is ignoring us and we are now getting from trading standardas [sic]' 

Poor service: Many of those  who have booked a trip to New York with Mr Allan have failed to hear from him 

Bernadette C from Blackpool added, 'I have not received any paperwork and have left countless messages with Clive Allard and his 'team'.

We have been advised by the police to take further action which is what I will be doing as Jet2.com have no record whatsoever of our flights....and I too am completing a form with the Fraud Squad immediately - Jet2.co were very interested too in wanting all his details and I will certainly not be fobbed off any further!!!!!!!'

Kirb80 equally despairs, ‘Like all of the previous postings, I have tried numerous different ways to try and contact him. He is not currently answering his mobile and you cannot leave a message as it is full.

Both my hotel and flight had reservation numbers but last Wednesday the flight reservation was cancelled due to Clive not paying for it.'

The Kent-based company Blue Skies Travel (UK) Ltd is registered at Companies House and was set up two years ago. Its director is listed at Clive Allard, who used to head up tour operator Travellers Cities until it collapsed two years ago leaving many out of pocket. 

Call back? Fly Vacations website has a notice claiming there is a ‘temporary fault’ with their phone line system

Action Fraud confirmed yesterday that it has referred complaints about Blue Skies Travel (UK) and Bright Skies Travel to the Met Police. 

The Civil Aviation Authority said that it would be looking at the TripAdvisor comments 'to see what might be happening'.

It should be made clear that the company, though of similar name, is not connected to Blue Skies Travel.

Despite attempts to contact Mr Allard by both customers and MailOnline Travel, he has not yet responded. 

The Fly Vacations website has a notice claiming there is a ‘temporary fault’ with their phone line system but if customers use their ‘Contact’ page, they will get back to you ‘as soon as possible.’
