He was famously found guilty of causing the death of Michael Jackson by involuntary manslaughter in an explosive high profile trial in 2011.

But despite being released from Los Angeles County Jail today, it appears that the disgraced doctor Conrad Murray could be preparing to release a book about his life and time with the singer.

According to TMZ, he does not yet have a publisher for the book but a deal is on the cards and  some have suggested he may even be approached to take part in a reality TV show.

The former cardiologist was convicted in 2011 of Jackson's death in June 2009.

After he was found guilty of 
involuntary manslaughter, the state of Texas revoked Murray's medical 
licence citing his felony conviction as the cause.

Earlier this month, Jackson's one-time personal doctor filed a civil petition in
Texas, asking a civil court judge to stop the state medical board's 
revocation of his medical licence pending his criminal appeal in 
California.

Murray’s Texas attorney is proceeding on the basis that the 
conviction isn’t 'final' until all appeals have been exhausted.

Charles
Peckham spoke of his client's desire to return to the medical profession saying, 'Dr. Murray has an unquenchable desire to help people, 
and no matter where it is, he will return to his given profession of 
healing'.

However
Murray's attempts to return to 'heal' people may well be thwarted after the Los 
Angeles District Attorney's office vowed to fight the convicted felon's efforts to 
get a medical licence anywhere in the country.

The 60-year-old's actions are likely to cause distress to Jackson's family who are 
already furious that the doctor is set for early release, having 
only served half his sentence for causing
Michael's untimely death.

Michael's
brother Jermaine Jackson said his famous family has been left outraged 
over the early prison release of the man they hold responsible for the death of global superstar Jackson.
