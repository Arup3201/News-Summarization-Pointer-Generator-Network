Sunderland slumped to an embarrassing 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa in front of their biggest crowd of the season as disgruntled supporters tried to storm the home dugout.

Head coach Gus Poyet insists he will not walk away after the result which leaves the Black Cats one place above the relegation zone.

But it was an alarming performance which has raised serious questions over his future and that of Sunderland’s top-flight status.

Sportsmail was at the Stadium of Light to witness their sorry display and brings you the merit marks which lay bare their shortcomings…

Gus Poyet can't bear to watch as his Sunderland side are dismantled by Aston Villa at the Stadium of Light

Costel Pantilimon 4 – Left exposed for three of the goals but was outwitted by Agbonlahor for crucial second which changed mood inside stadium.

Anthony Reveillere 3.5 – Looked a class act when he first signed, now looks like a 35-year-old veteran struggling with pace of Premier League.

John O’Shea 3 – The usually-dependable skipper was shambolic and will be wishing Republic of Ireland No.2 Roy Keane had not been in the stands.

Wes Brown 3 – Another who is looking like age is catching up with him and was helpless to prevent Villa from running riot in the first half.

Patrick Van Aanholt 3 – Afforded little help by those around him but Villa soon realised the weakness in Sunderland’s side and attacked at will down the left, where Van Aanholt had no answer.

Liam Bridcutt 4 – N’Zogbia ran all over him and the holding midfielder offered little resistance to wave after wave of Villa offensives.

Ricky Alvarez 3 – No surprise to see him hooked at the break after a typically ineffective first half. Reports that an £8m deal is already agreed for the Inter loanee must be a worry for Sunderland supporters.

Seb Larsson 4.5 – He ran about and gave his all but was involved in the bizarre incident at start of the second half where he failed to appear until the 49th minute. It was in keeping with the home side’s disastrous afternoon.

Ricky Alvarez is set to join the club for £8.5million from Inter - he was ineffective again in the first half 

Jack Rodwell 5 – It was arguably his best display in red and white, but there hasn’t been much to choose from. He at least got on the ball, although did little with it.

Steven Fletcher 3 – Asked to man the left-hand side of midfield, it was a tactic which backfired spectacularly as Villa right-back Bacuna had a hand in three of the goals.

Jermain Defoe 3 – Was anonymous and failed to pounce on the one decent cross flashed through the goalmouth by Fletcher.

Jermaine Defoe was anonymous up front and missed the few opportunities that did come his way

Subs

Connor Wickham (on 46) 5 – The second half was nothing more than a training-ground exercise and, like the rest of them, Wickham went through the motions. 

Manager

Gus Poyet 2 – Started with just one up front against lowly Villa and stationed striker Steven Fletcher on the left-wing. It was a negative set-up and produced a negative performance. He insists the players are still on board with his message, but the evidence on the pitch suggests otherwise.
