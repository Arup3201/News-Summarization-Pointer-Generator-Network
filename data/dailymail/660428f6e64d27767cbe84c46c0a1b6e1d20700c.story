A university student who fell to her death through a warehouse roof  may have been engaged in a ‘drunken prank’.

Vanessa Clarke plunged more than 20ft on to the concrete floor of a builders’ merchants in the early hours.

It is not yet known why the  22-year-old, who was studying computer science and business, had climbed on to the building.

But as tributes to the undergraduate were paid yesterday, a source close to the investigation said it may have been the result of alcohol-fuelled high jinks.

Miss Clarke, who is thought to be from London, was a third-year student at the University of Bath, and a member of its cheerleading squad, the Bath Jets.

She fell through the roof of a Travis Perkins warehouse in the town, close to a popular student pub, the Green Park Tavern.

Yesterday a cheerleading shirt and bouquets of flowers were left on railings opposite the site.

One message on a bunch of  flowers read: ‘Colourful ones for a colourful princess.’

On Twitter, Satender Kumar Mall wrote: ‘Sad to hear that my project colleague Vanessa Clarke passed away ... May her soul rest in peace. She was honest and hard-working team member.’ Another friend, Bath student Stephen Goater, said: ‘Truly a pleasure to have known and worked with you, Vanessa.’

Yesterday Bath University released a statement in which it said the institution was ‘saddened’ to confirm Miss Clarke’s death after she fell at around 4am on Saturday.

It continued: ‘Police are treating Vanessa’s death as a tragic accident and inquiries are continuing.

‘The university wishes to express  its deepest sympathies to her family and friends.

‘We recognise the impact this will have on students and staff who  knew Vanessa and are offering a range of support.’
