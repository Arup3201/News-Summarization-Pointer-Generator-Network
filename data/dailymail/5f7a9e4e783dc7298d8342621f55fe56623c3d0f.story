Vets who operated on a dog who was rushed to hospital after becoming sick were shocked to find he had swallowed 43 socks. 

The three-year-old Great Dane, was rushed to the DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital in Portland, Oregon, after his owners became concerned when he began to retch and vomit.

But when vets operated on pet they found the reason he was unwell was because he had ate the garments, solving the mystery of why the family's socks kept going missing.

All 43 socks, which were removed by surgeons, from a three-year-old Great Dane's stomach at the DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital 

The family took the dog to the animal hospital after he fell ill and was described as being generally miserable.

Vets then examined the Great Dane and performed x-rays, which revealed what they described as 'a large quantity of foreign material'.

It was then decided to perform exploratory surgery and two hours later, surgeons had removed 43 and a half socks from the dog's stomach.

Luckily the dog was unharmed and after spending a day in the hospital was free to return home to his family.

Surgeons carried out exploratory surgery after this x-ray showed a 'large quantity of foreign material' inside the dog's stomach 

Hospital spokeswoman Shawna Harch, said it was one of the strangest cases in the hospital's history.

This is despite the hospital also having to operate on another dog that had swallowed Gorilla Glue, with the video of the procedure posted to their website.

The x-ray and pictures came to light after a contest from the Veterinary Practice News, which shows some of the strangest things pets have swallowed.
