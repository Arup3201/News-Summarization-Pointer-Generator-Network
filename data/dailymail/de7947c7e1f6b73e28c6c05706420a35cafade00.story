The pregnant wife of a Missouri crop duster pilot killed in a tragic plane crash has revealed that, just before his death, her husband heard their unborn baby's heartbeat for the first time.

'I'm so thankful for that,' said LeAnn Malone, whose husband Hollis Malone died August 20 while doing the work he loved.

The 29-year-old pilot also left behind a 2-year-old son named Rylan when he died in the west Tennessee tragedy.

The fourth generation pilot and his wife had just announced LeAnn's second pregnancy when he died just a day after listening to his new baby's beating heart.

Over 2,000 people attended Malone's funeral, which LeAnn told KFVS is a testament to what a great man he was.

'He was the most loving caring, would do anything for anybody, full of life,' she said.

She also said he died doing what he loved. 

'Being a pilot is in his blood, he's a fourth generation pilot, and he had every intention of Rylan being a fifth generation,' Malone said.

Investigators have yet to uncover a cause of the crash, which occurred in the community of Bible Hill.

'I wish I would have talked him out of going into crop dusting at times, but I didn't want to hold him back from his dream,' Malone told KFVS. 'And I wanted to be supportive - but I knew how dangerous it was.'

Regardless of what happened, a mourning wife must now deal with the loss of the family's breadwinner as she prepares for the birth of their baby.

Malone had no life insurance, so friends and family have started a GoFundMe  page in hopes of helping his family financially.

'If Hollis touched your life in even the smallest way I just ask that you would consider a donation in his name,' the page reads.
