A Manhattan judge criticized Philip Seymour Hoffman's alleged drug dealer for claiming he had a heroin addiction in court on Friday after telling the post he was sober in an interview with The New York Post days earlier.

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin presented Robert Vineberg's interview to the court room during his bail hearing and he wasn't thrilled with Vineberg's contradicting stories.

'Some of the statements made on Mr. Vinebergâ€™s behalf are inconsistent,'said the judge.

Hopeless addict? Robert Vineberg's defense team claim the 300 bags of heroin found in his apartment were for personal use

Phillip Seymour Hoffman was discovered dead in his Greenwich Village apartment with a needle sticking out of his arm earlier this month

'He claims he is clean, you claim he is in the throes of a decade or more long addiction,' said McLaughlin to Vineberg's defense lawyer Ed Kratt.

The defense claims that the 300 glasslines of heroin found at the jazz musician's apt were for personal use and that he didn't sell any drugs to Hoffman.

The New York Post reports that the judge called Vineberg's amount of drugs 'off the charts' and valued the stash at $3,000.

Vineberg denied selling the 73 bags of heroin to the actor.

The troubled actor was discovered dead in his Greenwich Village apt with a needle sticking out of his arm.

McLaughlin's bail is set at $200,000 over $40,000 cash which is expected to be set by bail bondsman Ira Judelson.

Musician Robert Vineberg was regarded by friends who attended the court on Friday as 'talented' and 'generous'

Vineberg told The New York Post in his controversial jail interview that Hoffman was a 'hardcore addict' but that he himself was almost clean.

'He was using needles,' he said of the famous actor.

The Jazz musician has also been linked to other celebrity users such as Amy Winehouse.

Cops raided Vineberg's apartment at 302 Mott street after a confidential witness said that they'd seen Hoffman at the residence.

Vineberg told the post that he 'could have helped' the actor whom he'd known for about a year.

Friends of the musician who'd once toured with Wyclef Jean, came to the court to show their support.

Saxophonist Duke Guillaume who knew Vineberg more than 20 years said 'It was a shock to everyone...It's not the Robert we know.'
