Matthew Richell died after he was swept onto rocks while surfing at Tamarama Beach, in Sydney's east, at 2pm on Wednesday

A 41-year-old surfer who died after hitting his head at a popular Sydney beach was a well-known book publisher who had moved here from the UK with his young family.

Matthew Richell died after he was swept onto rocks while surfing at Tamarama Beach, in Sydney's east, at 2pm on Wednesday.

The father of two was pulled from the water by fellow surfers and paramedics unsuccessfully tried to resuscitate him.

Mr Richell was the head of Hachette Australia and had moved to Balmain with his wife Hannah and two children aged six and three, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Police said the book publisher had started out at Bronte beach before he was carried north towards Tamarama.

A jetski was on its way from nearby Bondi but a wave reportedly knocked him into rocks in an area known as 'The Twins' before he could be reached.

'It's dangerous in there because you have a lot of ledges underneath. You've got sharp rocks and there's no other way out of there,' Bondi lifeguard Bruce Hopkins told the newspaper.

Tamarama beach is not patrolled by life guards in the winter months.

A spokeswoman for Hachette Australia could not comment on Mr Richell's death but did say his family were too distraught to speak after police informed them of the death.

Mrs Richell was one of Hachette's authors and wrote Secrets of the Tides and The Shadow Year.  

The CEO of the UK arm of Hachette, Tim Hely Hutchinson, issued a statement following Mr Richell's death on Wednesday.

'Our thoughts and most heartfelt condolences are with Matt's wife Hannah, his family, his colleagues and many friends in publishing and more widely,' it read.
