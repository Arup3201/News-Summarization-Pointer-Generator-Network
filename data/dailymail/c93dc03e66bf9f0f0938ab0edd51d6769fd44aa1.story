John Gasovski, 48, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head on Sunday morning

The Sydney father-of-four whose body was found at the Jamberoo Mountain Lookout with a gunshot wound to the head may have been involved in organised crime, say police.

The body of John Gasovski, 48, was found on Sunday morning dumped in bushland.

A coroner's report said the Arncliffe man was killed by a single gunshot wound to the head in an 'execution-style' killing.

Police believe he had become involved with organised crime figures who had links to drugs.

'Police are examining any possible links between Mr Gasovski and organised crime. Drugs are one line of inquiry,' a police spokesperson told MailOnline.

'He involved himself in some way with criminal identities and we are trying to identify who those individual are.'

Police also revealed that they did not think Mr Gasovski's body had been lying in the bush for long before it was found, though they are waiting for forensic results to confirm the time frame.

Police are also investigating Mr Gasovski's whereabouts in the days preceding his death, saying they were not confident he even went to Canberra as he told his family, or remained in the Lake Illawarra/Wollongong area.

Mr Gasovski advised his family that he was going on a business trip to Canberra on Monday June 9 and that he would return the following day.

After no sign of him, his family contacted police to report him missing by June 12.Jackie Gasovski, the wife of the deceased, told the Mail Online that she is 'wracked with grief'.

'My husband was a good man and a good husband and he loved his children and his friends,' Jackie Gasovski said.

'He will be missed by everyone.'

Police Strike Force Berek, comprising of detectives from Lake Illawarra, St George and State Crime Command's Homicide Squad, are investigating the movements of Mr Gasovski's, leading up to his death.

They are also currently probing his business dealings and associates.

His body was found at the Jamberoo Mountain Lookout in Budderoo National Park by a park ranger

A member of the public discovered the corpse in the 7000-hectare Budderoo National Park, west of Kiama

State Emergency Service volunteers spent several hours searching the dense bushland where the body was found looking for clues.

Police are treating his death as suspicious and a murder investigation is underway.

It remains unclear if Mr Gasovski was shot at the lookout or another location.

CCTV footage from a number of locations is also being trawled for clues.

Mr Gasovski's Facebook page said he ran a company called JSJ Communications.

JSJ Communications was placed into liquidation in June 2013 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) issued a note to deregister the firm.

The lookout, in the 7000-hectare Budderoo National Park which is west of Kiama, is well-known for its spectacular views of NSW's south coast.

Police urge anyone with information about the incident to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
