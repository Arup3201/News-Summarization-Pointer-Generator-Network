When Caitlin Miller first met Scott Worgan six years ago it was ‘love at first sight’.

Now Scott's heart-warming proposal video has gone viral after the father-of-two enlisted his impossibly cute little girls to help him pop the question to the love of his life.

The 29-year-old, from the Central Coast in NSW, wrote out a series of signs for his romantic proposal and asked his daughters Scarlett, 3, and Sienna, 20 months, to hold them up in front of the camera.

‘You’re so amazing in every way. Everything you do for us. Everything you do for daddy makes us feel so special,’ one card reads. 

At one point Scarlett holds a sign upside down and Sienna hides behind them. 'Wouldn't it be cool if we were your flower girls?,' they ask.

Amazingly 27-year-old Caitlin had no idea what her partner had been planning for weeks, as he even managed to keep his little girls from spilling the secret.

'I'm still crying,' Caitlin told Daily Mail Australia as she revealed how Scott managed to film the proposal with their daughters in just one take.

The couple met in 2009 while they were both working at the same insurance company and quickly fell in love.

‘We became friends first of all, with some flirting in the office. Things started progressing from there. It was a quick little thing and we just fell in love and moved in together five months later,’ Caitlin recalled.

The pair had their first daughter, Scarlett, in 2011, and Scott has never stopped doing all he can to make Caitlin happy.

‘He’s a bit of a perfectionist and a romantic. He loves to cheer me up and do sweet things like making videos when I’m having a bad week,’ she explained.

The cute little girls told their mum Caitlin 'you would be such a beautiful bride' 

‘He makes videos for my birthdays and our anniversaries and when I’m having a bad day. He always picks me up with these little things so he knew I wouldn’t catch on till half way through.’

The pair had often spoken about marriage since having their first child but never really made plans and Caitlin had ‘no idea’ on the day that he was about to propose.

‘I was in shock that my oldest didn’t say anything, she is a bit of a chatterbox and she just stood still in the video and they did one take.’

While Scott was making the video with the girls one Saturday, Caitilin was at work and came home to find all the blinds shut.

‘My daughter came out and said “we made you something”. The next minute Scott came out with three cards saying “welcome home mummy” to cover it up,’ Caitlin recalled.

What the touching video doesn’t show is Caitlin’s shocked reaction as Scott handed her a ring just as their daughters held up the ‘marry daddy?’ card.

‘I was sitting on the couch in the lounge room and he was sitting next to me and pulled the ring out,’ Caitlin said.

‘He was shaking I was shaking and crying and flicked the ring across the room. Meanwhile, my oldest daughter was sick at the time and lying down. It was just typical us as parents,’ she laughed.

Once they’d picked the ring up off the floor, Caitlin saw the stunning Inverell sapphire Scott had bought her.

The happy couple have been inundated with messages about the proposal video 

‘The ring was made in Adelaide by Everett Brooke's. He walked in asking if they had sapphires and there they showed him an Inverell sapphire - the town where he is from. He had it made and sent to him a week later,’ she explained.

The happy couple have been inundated with messages, not just their friends and family but also from strangers wishing them well.

As for a date for the wedding, Caitlin said: ‘For one, it’s taken us six years and two children already. My sister is pregnant with twins and due in September and I want her to be a part of it so we are looking at after January for our wedding.’
