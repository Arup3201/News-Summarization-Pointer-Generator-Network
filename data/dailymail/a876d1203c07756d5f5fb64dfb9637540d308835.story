If Bayern Munich manage to overturn the 3-1 Champions League quarter-final first leg scoreline handed to them by Porto last week, Xabi Alonso will have his eyes on a very special record.

Should Pep Guardiola's side go all the way and claim this season's title as European champions, Alonso will become only the second player to win European football's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid. 

The only other player to have done so is AC Milan legend Clarence Seedorf, who lifted the famous piece of silverware for Ajax, Real Madrid and Milan.

It is quite an achievement, and one that the Spanish maestro recently admitted to thinking about.  

'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso told The Telegraph. 

'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' he added. 

Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. 

And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to sit in the stands for the final win over Atletico Madrid.

Seedorf won the title a total of four times in his illustrious career - in 1995 with Ajax, 1998 with Madrid and twice with Milan, in 2003 and 2007.

At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola, Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf's total achievement. 

Thiago Motta could also equal Seedorf's record if he manages to earn a Champions League medal with Paris Saint-Germain, but the 32-year-old midfielder has his work cut-out as the Ligue 1 side trail to a 3-1 aggregate scoreline against Barcelona. 

Names to have retired with two Champions League medals while at two different teams include the likes of Deco with Porto (2004) and Barcelona (2006) and former Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar who had been part of the 1995 Ajax squad before holding the trophy once again with the Red Devils.
