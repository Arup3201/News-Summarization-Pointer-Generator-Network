Accused: TV anchor Greg Kelly strenuously denies the claims against him; a source says the two exchanged explicit text messages before their date

The woman accusing New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly’s son of rape exchanged 'explicit' texts with Greg both before and after their date, a source has revealed.

The source told the New York Post exclusively that she first encountered Greg on a downtown street and told him he was ‘so cute.'

‘They were sexual,’ the source said, referring to the alleged texts. ‘They talked about what they wanted to do to each other.’

The source told the Post that texts between the 29-year-old paralegal and the Good Day New York anchor was like ‘two days of foreplay.’ In all, 17 text messages were exchanged between the two.

The woman, whose name has not yet been released, lied to her boyfriend so she could go out and meet Kelly, the source said. She reportedly told him that she was going out to meet a girlfriend.

The two met at Jeremy’s Ale House on October 8, a tavern on the historic New York waterfront, the New York Daily News reveals.

The pub is hardly high-brow, serving beer in Styrofoam cups and embellishing the graffiti-ridden ceilings with women's underpinnings.

The source said they ordered drinks and then headed to the woman’s law firm, also located in lower Manhattan. They then had sex in her office, the source said.

After the alleged attack, ‘they continued to text,’ the source said. ‘Part of it was about arranging another date.’

‘You don’t text your rapist – other than to say, “You’re awful,”’ the source told the newspaper.

Investigators from the Manhattan District Attorney’s office are looking into every possible piece of evidence in the high-profile case, the source said – including whether the woman used a swipe card to enter the building and the manner of how she entered.

‘There’s a difference between being drunk and being physically helpless,’ said the source. ‘Nobody had to carry her.’

According to the Daily News, DA investigators asked for video footage and a list of workers that night and Jeremy’s, the bar manager said.

Repeated leaks about allegations of 
rape filed against the son of the New York City Police Commissioner 
could undermine the investigation into the claims, according to legal 
experts.

The leaks, which 
include the claim that Greg Kelly is unlikely to be charged because his 
accuser is considered too unreliable, were criticised by Manhattan 
District Attorney Cy Vance.

'I
have absolutely no idea what source of that incendiary quote is,' Mr 
Vance said on Saturday, 'nor would I support an anonymous quote like 
that.'

His comments came days after NYPD boss Raymond Kelly refused to comment on the rape 
allegations against his TV host son Greg.

The major leak in the investigation came when the District Attorney's 
office said it will likely not file criminal charges against the 
43-year-old after he produced text messages he says 
prove the sex between him and the woman was consensual.

Sources
from the DA's office said they don't buy the law-firm paralegal's 
allegations against Greg Kelly and believe it to be a 'bunch of 
bulls***.'

Roger Canaff, a former special victims prosecutor who is now a legal consultant to the Army, told the Huffington Post that these leaks jeopardised the chances of a successful prosecution.

Accused: Greg Kelly, right, with his parents Ray - New York City Police Commissioner - and Veronica

'Whether or not the case is provable, leaking the idea that it seems like
garbage is really reckless,' he said. 'It is unfortunate and it is 
dangerous.'

'I'm not answering anything related to that matter,' Commissioner Kelly said at an officer promotion ceremony Friday, the New York Post reported.

'All those questions are for the district attorney.'

The Manhattan DA's office is handling the investigation to avoid any conflict of interest at the NYPD, where Greg Kelly's dad is the top cop.

The Good Day New York presenter, who was absent from his job this week, claims that 'flirtatious' texts from the woman will show the sex was consensual and they met for that purpose only.

An investigator told the New York Daily News: 'That could be the big key. Unless she taped the phone call, whether this guy gets 
charged could be determined by the texts.'

The phone call referred to is one 
which the alleged victim claims she made to Kelly after the alleged rape
in her downtown Manhattan law office, angrily demanding to know: 'What 
happened? Why did you do that?'

She claims she was woozy from too much
alcohol and doesn't remember parts of the evening but knows they had 
sex and that she didn't consent to it.

However a source told the Post she then sent him texts afterwards talking about 'doing it again'.

The woman - who has a boyfriend who 
had a vasectomy - also claims she became pregnant as a result of the sex
and had to have an abortion.

It was her boyfriend that is said to 
have encouraged her to go to the police after first confronting police 
commissioner Kelly at an event telling him: 'Your son ruined my 
girlfriend's life.'

Mr Kelly told him to write the 
allegations in a letter, but no letter was ever sent before the alleged 
victim walked into a New York police station on Tuesday to report the 
rape.

A source told the New York Post: 'It sounds like she
got caught [cheating] by her boyfriend, and then he forces her hand: "If you’re not lying, you better report".'

New York Mayor: Michael Bloomberg said yesterday he thinks the case has been handled correctly

The DA's office are said to be 
suspicious of the woman's claims for a number of reasons.

Questions have been raised over the three-month time delay from when the alleged rape took place on October 8
and when she actually reported it, the fact she does not remember most details 
of the attack, and the fact she stayed in contact with Greg Kelly after 
he allegedly raped her.

The source told the Post: 'The length of time (she took to complain) is a problem.

'And you don't communicate with someone who raped you.'

Another law-enforcement source said: 'The fact pattern is very suspicious . . . It just reeks of bull sh**.'

The Manhattan district attorney is 
investigating the serious allegations, as an NYPD probe could be seen as
a conflict of interest.

Kelly, a former Fox News 
correspondent, is cooperating with the investigation, his lawyer, Andrew
Lankler, said in an emailed statement.

Greg Kelly 'strenuously denies any wrongdoing of any kind',Mr Lankler 
said. 'We know that the district attorney's investigation will prove Mr
Kelly's innocence.' The lawyer didn't respond to questions about the 
focus of the investigation.

The woman is said to be a graduate 
from a prestigious Manhattan private school and is the daughter of a 
prominent lawyer.

Mayor Bloomberg spoke about the 
incident Thursday and said it was the 'right call' to turn it over to 
the DA's office to avoid a conflict of interests.

He said: 'Everyone has a right to have
their complaints investigated. I suspect that what happens to Ray Kelly
happens to me all the time.

'People are always, while you're 
walking through a crowd, saying things. 
When you get to be my age, you can't hear most of them, ' he said, 
referring to the confrontation between the commissioner and the woman's 
boyfriend.

'So half the time I have no idea what 
they're talking about, and the answer is: If you have a complaint to 
write it, and we take every complaint seriously.

'In this case, I thought the Police Department did exactly what they should do.

'And I also point out that as far as I
know, Greg Kelly's not been charged with anything. So I don't know how 
that's going to turn out.'

Lew Leone, the general manager of the 
local Fox station, has meanwhile confirmed Kelly 'has requested some 
time off' while the investigation is underway. He did not elaborate.

His co-host Rosanna Scotto offered support for him, saying today: 'I love Greg. That’s all I can say.'

A friend of the alleged victim’s 
boyfriend told ABC News that the woman had been ‘an emotional cripple’ 
since the alleged incident.

Mr Kelly, 43, joined Fox News Channel in 2002 and was the White House correspondent from 2005-2007.

A Marine Corps veteran and reservist, he also covered the Iraq War, including four assignments in Baghdad.

Before that, he covered politics for local cable news channel New York 1 and was an anchor and reporter for NewsChannel 34, an ABC and NBC affiliate in Binghamton, New York.

He also served for nearly a decade in the Marine Corps and is now a lieutenant colonel in its reserves.

Raymond Kelly, 70, returned to the police commissioner's post in 2002 after a stint in the 1990s.
