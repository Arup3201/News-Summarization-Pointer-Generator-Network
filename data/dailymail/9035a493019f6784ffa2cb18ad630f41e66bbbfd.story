Decision: The 23-year-old received an 'awkward' phone call from a senior executive who said it would be an issue for her to come back to the office because 'just about everyone had seen me half-naked online'

An intern at a top Wall Street asset management firm has quit so she can pursue a career in porn.

Paige A. Jennings, who moonlights under the name Veronica Vain, left Lazard Asset Management last week after co-workers saw nude selfies she took in the office bathroom  online.

The 23-year-old then received an 'awkward' phone call from a senior executive who said it would be an issue for her to come back to the New York because 'just about everyone had seen me half-naked online'.

According to Business Insider, in June she started as a part-time intern in alternative-investments marketing at the group in Manhattan. 

The Florida University graduate insisted that when the selfies surfaced, she was not fired and left her position willingly. 

She is to believed to have already handed in her two weeks notice when she started sneakily taking pictures in the toilets.  

Her Twitter description reads: 'I just left a job on Wall Street for a porn career because I can't stop masturbating at work.' 

Yesterday she added: 'I left finance because if I'm going to take it ** *** *** for a decade, I'd prefer to get in to a hall of fame for it.'

Jennings is now looking to kick start her career and has made it into the final casting of the X-rated Internet reality show, 'The Sex Factor.'

The porn competition which is set in Las Vegas and will be aired globally is scheduled to be hosted by Duke University porn star Belle Knox.

In an interview with Bro Bible, she said she did not expect her colleagues to see the explicit images because they were not attached to her name.

She said: 'Few people close to me knew what I was up to, but I firmly disbelieve they said anything, so I honestly have no idea how they came across it. So many people found out so fast, it is taking me for quite the spin.

On her decision to chose a new career path, she said: 'Intellectually speaking, I love financial analysis and thinking.

'However, I found that I was not cut out for the politicking required to be successful, and sitting at a desk for eight or more hours a day really sucks the life out of you. 

'More poignantly, it seems that being openly sexually confident and respectable are mutually exclusive in the corporate world for a woman, and that seriously irritates me. 

'So I started exploring other options that weren’t so stringent structurally. To quote Steve Jobs: “You’ve got to find what you love".'

'My boss’s boss called me over the phone with a HR lady. I had a pretty good reputation intellectually, and this executive was aware of that. However, he obviously couldn’t have me coming back to the office when likely just about everyone had seen me half naked online.'

She had previously worked as a stripper but did not think that it was a 'viable career path'. 

The Daily Mail Online has contacted Miss Jennings and Lazard Asset Management for comment.
