New research has laid bare the extraordinary rise in household energy bills over the past decade – despite families using less power.

We now pay an average of £410 more a year for our gas and electricity once inflation is taken into account.

That’s a massive 52 per cent increase above the general rise in the cost of living and despite energy use in the average home falling by 17 per cent in the same period.

Evidence compiled by consumer group Which? shows that the average energy bill soared by 137 per cent in cash terms between 2002 and 2012. Once inflation is accounted for, the average bill rose from £790 to £1,200 in today’s prices – and bills have continued rising ever since.

New research has laid bare the extraordinary rise in household energy bills over the past decade – despite families using less power

The figures are published at a time of mounting anger that the ‘big six’ energy companies have failed to pass on a sharp fall in the wholesale cost of energy in the past year. Industry analysts say the firms have scope to cut bills by as much as £130, but the firms have refused to act.

Industry regulator Ofgem has ordered the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to conduct an inquiry into the industry amid fears firms are rigging the market and profiteering. 

It says they need to explain to customers why they have failed to pass on the fall in wholesale costs. However, it has no powers to force them to do so. The increase in the average annual bill is all the more remarkable, says Which?, given the fact that average energy use per home has fallen.

This reduction can be partly explained by the fact that people have invested in better insulation and energy-efficient household appliances.

However, a major factor is that many people, including pensioners, have felt it necessary to ration their heat and light in order to protect themselves from spiralling tariffs. Which? said: ‘With such a massive rise in energy bills over the past decade, big reforms are needed to restore confidence in the energy industry and guarantee fair prices.’

The organisation has begun a Fair Energy Prices campaign and is calling on the CMA to establish benchmark prices for gas and electricity that suppliers can aim to beat. It said the firms should also be required to use simple, directly comparable pricing so people can more easily compare prices and make the best choice if they switch.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘At a time when rising energy prices are consumers’ number one concern, it is shocking that people are paying more despite using less. 

Sources at the ‘big six’ energy firms have suggested that one reason they have refused to cut tariffs is the threat of a price freeze should Ed Miliband win the General Election next May

That’s why it is all the more urgent that regulators and government act to give consumers confidence that the price we are paying for our energy is fair. Major reforms are needed to restore trust in the industry and to guarantee fairer energy prices for consumers.’

Recent figures from Ofgem show that the average profit margin firms make from customers has more than doubled in the past year from £48 to £102. The rise is largely because they have failed to pass on the fall in wholesale prices.

Sources at the ‘big six’ energy firms have suggested that one reason they have refused to cut tariffs is the threat of a price freeze should Labour win the General Election next May. They say they will not cut their prices this side of a vote if they are then forced to maintain these lower tariffs by a new government.

The net effect is that prices are being artificially inflated, which will leave many having to choose between heating and eating through the coming winter.

The higher prices are also handicapping British industry by driving up their costs, which is bad news for the wider economy.

Energy UK, which speaks for suppliers, said firms buy ahead to even out ‘peaks and troughs’ in global prices and it can take time for bills to catch up when wholesale prices fall. A spokesman said: ‘The energy industry works hard to protect consumers from changes in price.

‘Energy prices are influenced by a number of factors, including wholesale prices, network costs and Government levies. This means four fifths of the average bill are outside of suppliers’ control.

‘Customers have more and more ways to take control of how much gas and electricity they use.

‘Smart meters also help customers see exactly what gas and electricity is being used.’ 

Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts.

If you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. 

Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

Don't forget, prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live.

You only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.
