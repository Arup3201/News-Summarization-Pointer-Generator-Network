A quick glance at the current MotoGP standings is all you need, to see who is the current top dog in the sport.

Marc Marquez is in just his second season at the pinnacle of motorbike racing, but has won 10 of 11 races and is all but certain to reclaim the world championship he won in his rookie year last term.

Just having a quick glance at the standings do not do many of the riders justice however. In fact half-way down in 12th is arguably Britain’s most exciting prospect to come through the sport in recent years.

Stand and deliver: Scott Redding took Sportsmail for a lap around Silverstone in a Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade

To MotoGP fans, Scott Redding needs no introduction. The 21-year-old has worked his way up the series from 125cc (now Moto3), to Moto2 and for the first time this season, MotoGP.

Redding’s CV already makes for impressive reading. Originally from Quedgeley, a suburb of, Gloucester, he made history in June 2008 when he became the youngest rider of all-time to win a Grand Prix race (aged 15 years and 170 days) in the 125cc class.

Last season, Redding was a front runner in the Moto2 title, winning memorably at Silverstone, and only missing out to Pol Espargaro after picking up an unfortunate injury near the end of the season.

Now he is in the premier class of motorcycle racing… albeit on an open class bike which severely limits Redding’s progression during a race weekend.

Another one of those quick glances at his race results this year see finishes typically just shy of the top 10. It may seem a far cry from Marquez’s winning ways but Redding is giving his Honda crew just as much to smile about as the stunning Spaniard leading the way.

I met up with Redding at Silverstone in the build up to the British Grand Prix, and the 21-year-old was keen to get across that his season targets have already been hit – some as early as the first race of the season.

125cc Rookie of the Year

‘Before we tested we were targeting top seven, top eight,' Redding said. ‘But then we realised the bike didn’t have the potential for that. After testing when Nicky [Hayden] was a second in front, we were targeting on closing the gap to him and beating him from the second half of the year.

‘But then we got to the first race in Qatar and I beat him, so my target was done. Now it’s [the target] simply to be the top open class Honda each race.’

Given that Redding is the top open class Honda in the Championship, it’s safe to say he is stretching out as much as he can from his machinery.

Curiously, the Brit just trails a superior Honda in the factory ridden bike of Alvaro Bautista in the championship, and it’s at this point I sense a tinge of excitement, confidence and frustration when we start talking about his options for next year.

Redding clearly believes in his abilities and I get the impression that the 21-year-old appears bored knowing he can’t compete for race wins at this stage in his MotoGP career.

For Redding, the talk of a factory bike almost has him chomping on the bit and he speaks of his desire to land a factory ride – going as far as saying he would rather put his feet up at home rather than compete for another year in the open class.

One for the future: Redding became the youngest grand prix winner of all time when he triumphed at Donington Park in the 125cc category aged just 15 years and 170 days in 2008

It’s the words and attitude of a talent that truly believes he is ready for the next step as he informs me why he has the belief he is ready to step up to the next level.

Redding added: ‘Honda want to have me for two years, so it’s just a matter of where and what pieces we have. We need to see because Gresini are struggling at the moment and are speaking to other manufactures so we need to see what happens towards the next few races.

‘I have a two-year contract with Gresisni so in theory I need to stay with them so it’s difficult when they are thinking of going to another manufacture because the factory bike is so expensive and I’m not going to stay on the open bike. I spoke to the team and I’m not doing that, I’d rather stay at home.

‘I want to be in MotoGP, I don’t want to be in open class or Ducati open, I want to be winning races and fighting for the podium, that’s where I want to be. I don’t want to be messing around in open. One year, that’s fine, two years – not happening.

‘I think they [Honda] were impressed with Indianapolis and Sachsenring. Sachsenring was good in the mixed conditions and at Indy it was ‘you’ve done something with this bike that no one has done yet.’ That was good for me, and I’m starting to become more familiar with the bike.

‘It’s been quite a big step, but I’m not full powered MotoGP so it’s like a step inbetween. It was quite a big step to go fast, fast. Finding the extra half-second was difficult and then you have the race distance.

‘It’s like two more laps than Moto2 with the faster bike and a higher level. So it’s all harder. But for me it was nice to have that extra power.

‘I would love to have more horsepower in the bike so I can at least mix it with the big guys. My strengths are brake and entry speed as well as mid-corner. I’m really strong in changing directions.

‘In Sachsenring I was quite fast. In sector 2 I was top three all weekend through the sector and the same in Texas, mixing with the factory boys so it shows in the technical areas I have the ability, but the long straights just kill us.’

Hold on: Redding was at Silverstone in the build up to the British Grand Prix, giving Sportsmail a pillion ride

And that brings me to the reason why I travelled to the home of British motor racing to meet the rider who many hope can try at the very least bring home a first premier class win since the great Barry Sheene in 1981.

Being given the opportunity to ride pillion on the back of a Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade around three shortened laps of Silverstone, I held no nerves as I climbed on to the back of Redding’s bike ready for a thrill seeking ride around the circuit.

We don’t even make it to the end of the pit lane before my high enthusiasm turns to a mixture of terror and pure excitement.

Flying around the track while constantly breaking the 100mph mark is some experience, as is leaving your seat and almost sitting on Redding’s head every time he brakes going into a corner.

The terror faded quickly as I got used to the speeds but the excitement never drained even as I spoke to Redding shortly after the ride.

I almost had to pick my jaw from off the ground when the 21-year-old informed me he was pushing only a third of what he is capable of.

‘Today was more than normal! Redding said. 'These superbikes handle better with two people rather than one, believe it or not. I don’t know how much I’m pushing, I go knee down which I don’t think many people did with pillion. You’re not breaking on the limit because the riders are changing so the weight is different.

‘You can have a small girl who is about 50 kilos and you can have a guy who is 80 kilos – break in the same place and you’re gone!

‘I would say you are pushing at 30 per cent. I’m not twiddling because you want the pillions to feel the load under braking and on the throttle when you feel the bike transfer, while using all the track.’

I leave Silverstone convinced that Redding’s career is destined to only take him higher in the sport, and while he may not be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Marquez and Valentino Rossi this weekend, you certainly won’t be surprised if he is stepping on a MotoGP podium should he get his factory ride in the near future.

MotoGP comes to Silverstone for race weekend on August 29th, race coverage starts from Friday at 8:30am and continues on Saturday and Sunday exclusively live on BT Sport.
