Ray Rice has spoken a day after having his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens.

The Super Bowl-winning running back also received an indefinite suspension from the NFL after CCTV footage was posted online of him striking his then-fiancee (and now wife) in an Atlantic City casino.

'I have to be strong for my wife,' Rice told ESPN's Josina Anderson. 'She is so strong. We are in good spirits. We have a lot of people praying for us and we'll continue to support each other. I have to be there for (Janay) and my family right now and work through this.'

Rice then handed the phone to Janay Rice, who added: 'I love my husband. I support him... I want people to respect our privacy in this family matter.'

The sickening footage has sent shockwaves through the sport.

Rice's initial two-game ban by Baltimore was widely ridiculed when reports emerged of the incident.

A police report described him as having caused 'bodily injury to Janay Palmer, specifically by striking her with his hand, rendering her unconscious.'

A Ravens spokesperson insisted that the team was not aware of the footage, and labelled it 'a game changer'.

Out cold: Palmer was dragged from the lift after it stopped and Rice was later arrested

The footage, released by TMZ, shows Rice appearing to strike his beau before she hits him back. He then seems to lash out at his then-fiancee, knocking her to the floor and into a railing.

As she lies motionless on the floor, Rice drags her body into the casino lobby where a security guard attends to the matter.

The NFL's online shop removed Rice jerseys on, and the Ravens announced they will offer an exchange at official team stores.

And video game publisher Electronic Arts is removing him from the roster of Madden 15 through an online update.
