Crime is at its lowest for almost a quarter of a century, according to police figures.

There were 3.9million crimes recorded in England and Wales in the past year, the lowest since 1989, statistics revealed yesterday.

Total crime has fallen by around a third in a  decade, from its peak in the mid-1990s, and by 6 per cent in the past 12 months.

'Welcome news': The latest statistics, compiled using both crimes recorded by police and the Crime Survey for England and Wales, show a decrease in the number of offences over the past decade

Only pickpocketing and other personal thefts were up, by 6 per cent, continuing a rise which began three years ago.

Criminologists added a note of 
caution, warning the official figures were under-counting certain types 
of crime, such as card fraud.

Estimates of violent crime are now at around half the level seen in 1995, according to the Crime Survey of England and Wales

Due to the way crime is recorded, the 
worst  incidents of civil unrest in England in recent memory barely 
registered in the figures.

Dr David Green, of the Civitas 
think-tank, said: ‘We are entitled to be a little bit suspicious about 
such a major fall. They do not count each victim of card fraud as a 
victim, but individual banks. I think there’s an awful lot more fraud 
than is contained within the figures. Crime stats no longer cover all 
the main types of crime that are going on.’

But he said high prison population 
numbers meant many of the repeat criminals ‘who need to be in prison are
there’ and this would have a downward impact on crime figures.

The 
statistics for the 12 months to June this year show that police-recorded
burglary was down 6 per cent, robbery 7 per cent and violent attacks 6 
per cent. Criminal damage was down 12 per cent, firearms offences 18 per
cent and car theft 14 per cent. Homicide was down 14 per cent.

There was further good news from the 
National Crime Survey, also published yesterday. According to ministers,
it suggested that members of the public were ‘less likely to be a 
victim of crime than at any time since 1981’.

Based on interviews with 40,000 people
about their experiences of crime in the past year, it  suggested crime 
was at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981, with 10million 
offences recorded – half the level seen in 1995.

While the latest figures indicate that overall levels of crime are falling, they show that pick-pocketing increased over the past year

The falls showed that cuts to police 
red tape were freeing up officers, said Crime Prevention Minister Jeremy
Browne.

'Crime has been falling for 20 years now. We welcome this of course, but we know from the thousands of victims we’ve helped in the last month alone that crime is a real problem for a lot of people'

Javed KhanVictim Support chief executive

He added: ‘Police reform is working. We have swept away central
targets and reduced bureaucracy. This shows that how the police are 
deployed, rather than their absolute numbers, is what is key to cutting 
crime.’

The falls have come despite sharp cuts
in  government funding for the police, which will fall by a fifth in 
the five years to 2015.

Victim Support chief executive Javed 
Khan said: ‘Crime has been falling for 20 years now. We welcome this of 
course, but we know from the thousands of victims we’ve helped in the 
last month alone that crime is a real problem for a lot of people.’
