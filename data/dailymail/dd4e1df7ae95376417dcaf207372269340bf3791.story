Liverpool are revving up their attempts to keep Raheem Sterling from Real Madrid's clutches by offering the wonderkid a bumper new contract.

The Anfield club are set to offer the 19-year-old a new contract that will include a sharp increase on his current £30,000-per-week deal as a reward for his excellent displays this year.

His current deal still has three years left to run, but Liverpool want to lock the talented youngster down to a longer contact.

New deal: Sterling will be offered a new contract, despite having three years left to run on his current one

Sterling has established himself as one of Europe's best emerging talents, and was one of only a few England players to enhance his reputation during the World Cup.

His performances have not escaped Real Madrid, who are known to be keeping a close eye on the youngster.

But Liverpool are anxious to avoid any uncertainty over their whizzkid's future and will look to ward off the Champions League holders' interest.

Luis Suarez' departure means even more focus will be thrust upon Sterling's young shoulders during the forthcoming season.

But there is a growing feeling at the Anfield club that Sterling is showing the maturity needed to take the added responsibility in his stride.

Speaking this week, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: 'This kid is only going to get better. He’s way above the level from when he first came in.

'Tactically, technically, and what has been beautiful to watch with Raheem has been his maturity.

'He’s turning into a beautiful young man, with all the responsibility. He’s still only 19, but in big games he’s performed and he’s a wonderful talent.'
