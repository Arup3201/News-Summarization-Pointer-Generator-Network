Anders Breivik flanked by police officers arrives at a court hearing in Oslo today

Mass killer Anders Breivik was due in court today as relatives of the 69 people he gunned down gathered on the island of Utoya to pay their respects.

Breivik arrived at the Oslo courthouse for a closed hearing to discuss the conditions of his detention.

He had asked to wear a black tuxedo to the session but the request was rejected by the Oslo District Court, which described it as 'unnecessarily disturbing and provocative'.

Police, who have so far stated they believe he acted alone, say they want to prevent him communicating with any potential accomplices  .

Officers are understood to be asking for an extension of terms allowing them to hold Breivik in isolation.

A four-week limit on solitary confinement is due to expire on Monday. Police say the isolation conditions are helping them find out just what happened.

Meanwhile about 500 relatives of the 69 people killed on Utoya gathered on the island to mourn their losses and to hear from police exactly where and how their loved ones were killed.

Accompanied by police officers and a team of psychiatrists the group, many of whom donned white disposable rain wear to protect them from the bad weather, made a sombre procession across the island.

They were shown the exact spots where their loved ones were brutally gunned down by Breivik during the massacre last month.

Some of the terrified victims tried to hide under beds or in the woods while others jumped into the lake and attempted to swim to the mainland.

Ketil Haukaas, deputy director of 
Norway's National Investigation Service, said: 'We will show them 
exactly where the people were found and give them details from the 
forensics investigation. 

Some of the teenagers who survived the attack are due to visit the 
island on Saturday and on Sunday a large memorial service will be held 
in Oslo's Spektrum.

Last week Breivik, accompanied by a police team, retraced the route he took across the island on the day of the killings.

If found guilty on terrorism charges he faces 21 years in prison.

Breivik has admitted killing 77 people last month, including eight in a bombing in central Oslo.

The 32-year-old right-wing extremist 
denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to 
save Norway and Europe.

Earlier this week it emerged he had 
prepared a second bomb that was bigger than the one which detonated in 
Oslo killing eight people.

At a court hearing today Breivik was due to find out whether he will have to spend also the next four weeks in isolation at Ila prison near Oslo

Military sources discovered a 3,300lb device at his farm around 85 miles north of the city.

By comparison, the bomb which went off in the capital weighted 2,095lbs according to estimates.

Yesterday authorities released the contents of two phone calls that Breivik made to police during the island massacre.

In the first call he describes himself as 'commander Anders Behring Breivik, of the Norwegian anti-communist resistance movement'.

In his second, made one minute before his arrest, he tells the police operator: 'I have completed my operation and want to give myself up.'
