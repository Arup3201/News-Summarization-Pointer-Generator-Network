These incredible pictures have captured the moment two hippos ferociously attacked each other in a bid to gain dominance over the herd.

The male hippos - who weigh around five tons each - launched themselves through the muddy waters trying to intimidate and injure their opponent.

Photographer Nils Rinalidi, 38, from Lausanne, Switzerland, took the amazing shots in Katavi National Park, Tanzania when he came across a small pond where more than 100 hippos were cooling off whilst on safari.

He said: 'The hippos concentrated at the pond because of the dry season - 
during the night they like to wander off into the bush to feed on grass.

'This pair were two large alpha male hippos - they probably fought over a female, or for leadership of the group.

'The other hippos were hardly bothered by the battle - only when they got disturbed by the fighters did they begin to react.

'The
 largest hippo - on the right side of the picture - won the fight and 
the aggressor resigned himself to his defeat and walked off.'
