Going into the home leg 1-0 down, Arsenal knew they had to score goals to make a historic an unlikely Copa Libertadores semi-final.

But the game finished 0-0, leaving many players heartbroken on the floor - an image which supporters hope won't be recreated on Saturday?

Meanwhile, club captain Thomas Vermaelen has spoken about the favourites tag on Arsenal against Steve Bruce's side.

'There will always be pressure for a cup final,' he said.

'The players are used to playing under pressure because if you play for a club like Arsenal, you have to win every single game. People expect that so Saturday won't be different. The pressure will be there always to win that game.

'We are used to the pressure, every game has to be won. Of course we know that there has been a lot of talk of not winning for nine years but it is a game we have to win.

'We know there is a lot at stake as well but we go in with a lot of confidence.'

Bad omen? Arsene Wenger is looking to make sure his English side end a nine-year trophy drought against Hull
