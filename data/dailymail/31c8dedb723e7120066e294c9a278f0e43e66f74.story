A man has been jailed for nine years after he repeatedly punched an African migrant to the ground in a violent robbery in a train station alleyway, last October.

Timothy Williams, from Illawarra, NSW, can be seen hitting the refugee so hard in his face that he required stitches in his left ear and lost a tooth, in CCTV footage shown in court on Thursday morning.

While his victim was on the floor, the 26-year-old continuously bashed the man as he tried to escape the unprovoked assault.  

The refugee had only been in Australia for five days after travelling from his native Eritrea - one of the most violent countries in the world - when he was set upon at Wollongong railway station, 82 kilometres south of Sydney.

Smack: The moment Timothy Williams first punched the African refugee last October at Wollongong railway station, NSW

His attackers saw their victim approach the pedestrian ramp while on the railway overpass on Crown Street and stopped to wait for him.

Mr Williams then signalled for the man to come over to him, demanding his cash.

However, the refugee speaks little English and did not understand the demands.

Mr Williams grabbed money from his backpack, prompting the victim to hand over a few coins from his pocket.

His blonde friend Jaimee Lee Haynes, 28, hangs around in the background, reportedly acting as a lookout - unaware that the whole scene was being filmed on CCTV anyway.

During the mugging video, she strolls about in front of them in purple shorts before scarpering for a short period while Mr Williams suddenly bashes the refugee to the ground.

As the onslaught continues, the man can be seen begging for mercy as he is thrown about the alley by Mr Williams.

Trickery: Mr Williams appears to chat with the man as he goes through his bag, while his blonde friend Jaimee Lee Haynes, 28, hangs around in the background as a lookout

Surprising: At the beginning of the CCTV video it appears that the two men are just chatting like friends but Mr Williams is actually demanding his victim's cash

A passer by sees the incident but fails to stop.

When he is eventually free of his attacker's clutches, he attempts to run away but falls to the floor before reaching the end of the pathway.

Mr Williams' friend Ms Haynes then reappears in the video and the pair begin calmly collecting the victim's belongings from the floor.

The muggers got away with the man's necklace, bracelet, sunglasses, headphones and $60 in cash.

As the victim looks back one last time, Mr Williams appears to shout something at him before strolling off.

Judge Paul Conlon said the shocking CCTV footage was a reliable account of what happened during the violent assault.

'A viewing of this footage is all that is needed to make an accurate assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence,' he said, the Illawarra Mercury reported.

The Judge confirmed that the pair were waiting for their victim to reach the train station's pedestrian walkway.

'When the victim was stopped, it was also clear that there was a plan of action,' he said.

He also revealed how Mr Williams attempted to downplay the attack while speaking to a court-appointed psychologist.

'He provides [the doctor] with a palpably false version of his confrontation and vicious assault on an unsuspecting victim,' Judge Conlon said.

Mr Williams will be locked up for six years, back-dated to when he first came into custody at the time of the offence, and won't be eligible for parole in 2019.

Meanwhile, the woman seen with him in the video - Ms Haynes - will be sentenced on Friday.

The victim was a refugee from Eritrea, a country in the Horn of Africa that is bordered by Sudan to the west, Ethiopia in the south, and Djibouti in the east.

The man had only been in Australia - supposedly a safe nation - for five weeks when he was violently set upon.

His home country, which has a poor human rights record, is now in a fragile state of peace after more than 30 years of fighting.

However, thousands are now fleeing due to a forced labour program that is spawning human rights violations, according to a report last month that will be debated next month at the U.N. Human Rights Council.

The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR estimates that 2,000 people of Eritrea's 6 million population are fleeing every month.

Their relatives are forced to pay fines of 50,000 nafka (about $3,607) for each family member who has left.

Most families can't afford the fine so a family member may be detained until the money is paid, or business licenses or property may be confiscated, the report said.

The government began its program of national service, where people are put to work in reforestation, soil and water conservation and reconstruction, in 1995 but it has turned into an indefinite conscription, the report said.

Eritrea emerged from its long war of independence in 1993 only to plunge once again into military conflict, first with Yemen and then with its old adversary, Ethiopia.

The country is ruled by President Isaias Afewerki, who has been in office since independence in 1993. National elections have been scheduled and cancelled - they have ever been held since the country became independent.

People who practice 'unregistered' religions, try to flee the nation, or escape military duty are arrested and put into prison.

The religions that are allowed in the country are the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Eritrean Lutheran Church, and Sunnite Islam.

All other religions are persecuted and freedom of worship is one of the top reasons thousands of Eritreans flee the country.

Meanwhile, a 2011 UN report estimated that about 70 per cent of Eritreans cannot meet their food needs on their own. But the government insists Eritrea is self-sufficient in food and declines international food aid.

Domestic and international human rights organisations are also not allowed to function in Eritrea.

Eritrea is a country in the Horn of Africa that is bordered by Sudan to the west, Ethiopia in the south, and Djibouti in the east
