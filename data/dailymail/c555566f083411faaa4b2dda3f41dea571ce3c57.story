Joan Rivers is a tough act to follow, but E! Network has decided its hit show Fashion Police will continue - with Kathy Griffin filling Joan's Jimmy Choos.

Show insiders tell MailOnline, that Joan's daughter Melissa Rivers agreed to continue to produce her mother's show and has given her blessing to the choice. E! executives are negotiating a deal with the popular redhead.

'Kathy has been told if she wants
the gig she can have it because Melissa wanted someone who her mother
would have approved of,' says the show source. 'Kathy will probably take the position but they are still working
out the deal.'

Bittersweet substitute: Joan Rivers and Kathy Griffin, here at the Comedy Central Roast of Joan in 2009, have long been friends. Now Kathy, with her brash, outspoken wit, has been tapped to take over for Joan on Fashion Police

In her memory: E! Network revealed it has decided hit Fashion Police will continue without its famed host, saying that is the way Joan Rivers would have wanted it

Sad farewell: Kathy was among the mourners at Joan's memorial service at New York City's Temple Emanu-El on September 7

Joan
created Fashion Police and Melissa produced and directed the show, so Joan's grieving daughter
may be on the first show they tape to say a few words about her mother and to
introduce Kathy.

While Joan was in a coma, rumors were floating around at the time that Kathy would pitch hit for Joan on the show, which she vigorously denied.

“It’s disgusting. It’s not true,' she told Larry King . 'And I know that stuff shouldn’t bother me at this stage of my career—you know, I thought I’d heard it all—but that one hurts, because it’s as far from the truth as you can get.'

Griffin, 53, who was among the dozens of celebrities who attended her unconventional memorial service on September 7, lauded Joan for paving the way for women in comedy.

Kathy began performing in the early 1980’s at the Improv Comedy Troupe at The Groundlings in Los Angeles. Her big Hollywood breakthrough came on the hit BRAVO reality show ‘Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-list’ that ran from 2005-2010.  Kathy won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Reality Program and she has released six comedy albums that were all nominated for Grammy Awards.

'Kathy adored and admired Joan,' a close family friend revealed. 'Not only did Joan mentor Kathy they were really close friends. Kathy is heartbroken that she is gone.” 

Fashion hit: The E! show also stared Giuliana Rancic, Kelly Osbourne and George Kotsiopoulos

Paying tribute: E! aired a special tribute Fashion Police show on September 19, hosted by Joan's daughter, Melissa Rivers

Since the 81-year-old's death on September 4, the show which she helmed had been on hold and its future uncertain.

But last week E! announced Fashion Police would return in 2015.

In a statement the broadcaster said it
 would return to television screens for post Golden Globes coverage and 
the decision was only made with the late comedian's daughter Melissa's 
blessing.

The statement 
said: 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of Joan Rivers and, for the 
last two weeks, have turned our attention to honoring her memory on all 
of our platforms. We have also thought long and hard about what Joan 
would have wanted as it pertains to the future of Fashion Police.

'We decided, with Melissa Rivers’ blessing, that Joan would have wanted the franchise to continue.'

E! has not said what changes will be made to the show's format - which also stars Giuliana Rancic, Kelly Osbourne and George Kotsiopoulos.

The statement added: 'Fashion Police will return in 2015 commencing with Golden Globes coverage on Monday, January 12. No further details will be announced at this time.'

Tough shoes to fill: The redhead said the late host, pictured 2013, 'brought a fearlessness and a brand of humour into our homes that we really need'

Guiding force: The 81-year-old comedian had helmed the show since 2011 and is pictured in the post-Emmys and MTV VMAs show August 26

Speaking on whether she would want the show to continue, co-host Giuliana said she was in two minds.

She told ABC News on Thursday: 'A part of me is like Joan would want Melissa and us and the team to go on and I know she would, but it's just a matter of can there be a show without Joan?'

'Do we want to do a Fashion Police without Joan? I don't know.'

As the guiding force of the program, Joan
 led co-hosts Giuliana, Kelly and George since 2010 on the show that picked apart celebrity fashion on the red 
carpet.

Working till the very end: Only two days before the veteran actress suffered a cardiac arrest during a routine medical procedure, she was leading the charge against bad red carpet fashion

Starting off as just a half an hour show,
 it was quickly expanded to an hour as Joan's biting and no holds 
barred commentary on Hollywood's top stars won over audiences.

Only two days before the veteran actress suffered a cardiac arrest during a routine procedure last Thursday, she was leading the charge against bad celebrity fashion at the MTV VMAs and Emmy Awards.

During that show - aired August 26 - Joan
 had sounded a little raspier than usual but, if she was not feeling her
 best, the longtime red carpet reporter did not show it or hold back 
about those who committed fashion don'ts.

A special episode called Fashion Police:
 Celebrating Joan airs Friday, September 19 at 8 p.m. ET. in the US and 
September 20 at 9pm in the UK.

Hard shoes to fill: Speaking on whether she would want the show to continue, co-host Giuliana said she was conflicted about carrying on without Joan
