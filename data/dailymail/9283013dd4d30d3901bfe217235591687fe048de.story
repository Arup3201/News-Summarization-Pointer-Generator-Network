This was Divock Origi’s big audition to the Liverpool public. Could the young Belgian survive out there on a cold, dank and rainy November night on Merseyside?

Granted he was on the ‘wrong’ side of the divide so to speak, taking to the hallowed Goodison Park turf instead of his future home at Anfield, but the 19-year-old Belgian knew this was his opportunity to shine with the eyes of all Liverpool supporters on him – not to mention those of his soon-to-be-rivals.

A goal for Origi against Everton on Thursday, helping Lille to knock some of the stuffing out of the Toffees’ so-far promising Europa League campaign, and immediately he would have been a hero in the Red side of this football-loving city.

For Liverpool fans are crying out for a striker to love right now – and Origi hopes to be that man, but he unfortunately is not yet ready to fill such big, pressurised boots just yet.

Having been deprived of the free-scoring Daniel Sturridge since the beginning of September, Liverpool’s trio of replacement strikers – Rickie Lambert, Fabio Borini and, of course, the mercurial Mario Balotelli – have managed precisely zero Premier League goals between them this season.

Brendan Rodgers took a calculated gamble on signing Balotelli from AC Milan for £16million in the summer and, as of yet, that roll of the dice has not landed favourably.

But Balotelli is only one of two strikers signed by the Liverpool boss this summer – Origi was snapped up from Lille for £10m but immediately loaned back to the Ligue 1 side.

A star of the World Cup – displacing Everton’s £28m forward Romelu Lukaku in the Belgian side for the latter stages – Origi was seen as a shrewd buy.

Yet Rodgers took the decision to loan him back, deeming him not-yet-ready to lead Liverpool’s line in the heated battle of the Premier League. And it was Lukaku who won the battle of the Belgian strikers in the Europa League. The Everton striker was more involved and influenced play far more than his young rival. To be fair on Origi though, he was not helped by his team-mates’ hapless display at Goodison Park. Lille were inept in almost every possible way.

Reds boss Rodgers is keeping a close eye on Origi’s progress, having told LiverpoolFC.com that he is monitoring each and every one of the Belgian’s game – and he is almost certain to have seen his display at Goodison and come to the conclusion that he was vindicated in his decision.

As Rodgers says, there is a lot for which Origi can ‘improve’ on.

He is raw, there is no doubt about that.

Origi is not the most prolific striker in the world – he is not going to challenge Cristiano Ronaldo and ex-Red Luis Suarez for European football’s Golden Boot anytime soon – but he has bagged four goals already this season in 10 starts (plus three substitute appearances), showing he can find the back of the net.

The 10-cap Belgian needs to develop and grow into his own, that much is clear, but he is no mug and he is no shrinking violet. It may take him time to adapt to English football but, on the basis of this performance, there are positives.

He put his 6ft 1in frame around and, although he weakly diverted a header towards Tim Howard in the first half, he did cause Tony Hibbert some problems down the left.

Thursday night was a key night in his development and he will come through it a better player. He ran tirelessly for a cause in which his team-mates gave him precious little to work with. It was painful at times watching him run down another terrible long ball, launched into No Man’s Land with no godly hope of Origi being able to get a hold of it and launch a meaningful attack.

Pushed off the ball too easily by Phil Jagielka on occasion, he came back in the second half and had already by that stage started to put his body on the line and show his own strength.

He also displayed some lovely touches on the ball, he ran his heart out for the cause and he now knows what it is like to play in front of Liverpool’s closest rivals.

Origi is certainly not the finished product yet but come next summer Balotelli in particular better beware – he may be displaced in Rodgers’ thinking by a young but upwardly-mobile Belgian.
