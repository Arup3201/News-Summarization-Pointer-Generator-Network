Bosnian Sanel Sahbaz has been allowed to stay in Britain despite a string of convictions because his human rights would be violated if he were to return to his home country

A foreign criminal who used human rights laws to stay in Britain carried out a string of assaults on a woman while his deportation case was being considered, a court has heard.

A hearing last August ruled that Bosnian Sanel Sahbaz could stay in Britain because his human rights would be violated if he were to return to his home country.

But St Albans Crown Court has since heard that at that time, and then after his court victory, he was subjecting a woman in her 20s to assaults, false imprisonment and was making threats to kill her.

Last month a jury at St Albans crown court found Sahbaz, 31, of Hertford, not guilty of raping the woman in a hotel room in Stevenage, between May 16 and May 21 2013.

But the nine men and three women were unaware of his violent past or the fact that he had admitted offences of making threats to kill, false imprisonment, actual bodily harm and common assault against his latest victim carried out between July and October last year.

On Friday Judge Marie Catterson said that she considered him a dangerous offender who posed a significant risk of harm to members of the public by violent offending.

She jailed him for four years with an extended sentence of five years, which means he will be supervised by probation officers on his release if he remains in this country.

She was told by prosecutor Will Noble that he has been served with a second deportation notice. The judge told Sahbaz: 'It is a matter for the authorities if you are deported.'

But she said it was her understanding that it was usually the case if sentences of 12 months or longer were passed.

Sahbaz arrived in Britain as an 11-year-old dependent of his refugee father in 1993.

St Albans Crown Court has heard that at that time of his deportation trial, and then after his court victory, he was subjecting a woman in her 20s to assaults, false imprisonment and was making threats to kill her

He has a criminal record which goes back to 2001 and eight convictions for 28 offences - including theft, fraud, assault, damaging property, disorderly behaviour, racially abusive insulting words, failing to surrender, assaulting a constable.

On 18 June 2009 he was jailed for a total of 4 years with a year's extension to his licence for causing actual bodily harm between 17 to 18 January 2009. Prosecutor Wayne Cleaver said at the previous hearing: 'The victim of the actual bodily harm was his landlord.

'He had intervened in a dispute between the defendant and his then girlfriend. He was punched to he ground and kicked unconscious.'

He received concurrent sentences of 15 months for GBH on 27 June 2008 and affray on 9 June 2008. He was on licence from jail at the time he attacked the woman.

Sahbaz faced automatic deportation after receiving the 4 year sentence, but was told he could stay indefinitely after he brought a legal challenge under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to private and family life.

His barrister John Marchant said Sahbaz took 'full responsibility for his actions for which he apologises.'

Last year, 200 offenders – including rapists and muggers – successfully 
challenged their removal by citing Article 8 of Labour’s Human Rights 
Act.

A Somali rapist, who held a 
knife to a pregnant woman’s throat as he assaulted her, is among the 
many criminals who cannot be deported from Britain because of rules on a
 right to family life.

Mustafa Abdullahi (right),
 31, was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his 
‘vulnerable’ victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home.

He
 was set to be deported on release and Home Office lawyers warned 
immigration judges of his dangerous nature and a continued lack of 
respect for the law.

But
 last December he was deemed to have a right to a family life under 
Article 8 and released. Abdullahi does not have any children or a wife 
in Britain, but his mother and siblings live here.

Separately, last August it was revealed Sanel Sahbaz,
 a foreign criminal jailed for

various violent attacks, had successfully
 argued against deportation because it would violate his human rights.

Sahbaz,
 30, a Bosnian who now lives in Hertford, came to Britain as a child in 
1993. Since 2005 he has committed a string of offences including common 
assault, handling stolen goods, theft, public order offences and 
assaulting police.

He 
qualified for automatic deportation after he was jailed for four years, 
and the Home Office told him he would be sent home. But he was told he 
can stay indefinitely after he brought a legal challenge under Article 
8.

His lawyers argued 
that if he was sent back to Bosnia it would separate him from his 
parents, brother and cousin, who are also in Britain, which would breach
 his rights.

Learco Chindamo was 
jailed indefinitely for knifing to death headmaster Philip Lawrence, a 
father of four, 18 years ago outside St George's Roman Catholic School 
in Maida Vale, west London, in 1995.

The teacher went to help a 
13-year-old pupil who was being assaulted.

The
 former gang member was ordered to serve at least 12 years, but released
 in July 2010 after claiming he was a reformed character.

The
 Government was prevented from deporting Chindamo to Italy, where he 
lived as a child, after his lawyers argued it would breach his human 
right to a family life.

He
 was freed and allowed to live in Britain, but returned to jail only 
months later for breaching the terms of his parole.

He has remained in 
prison since but last week the Parole Board approved his release once 
again.
