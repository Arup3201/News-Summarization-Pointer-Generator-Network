More men are getting Botox than ever before, but unlike their female counterparts, the goal is not to eliminate all of their wrinkles.

New York City-based plastic surgeon Dr Norman Rowe said male professionals are asking for subtle changes in their appearance. He's dubbed the look the 'Wall Street Wrinkle' because a large amount of the men requesting the tweaks are in finance.

'They really want to avoid looking overdone,' he told ABC News, explaining that many men view their wrinkles as a 'badge of honor'.

He noted: 'I don't necessarily see that as much in females. They want complete rejuvenation.'

According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, nearly 400,000 US males got Botox injections in 2013, which is a 310 percent increase since 2003.

Dr Rowe's patient Joseph Mancuso was filmed getting his first Botox injections to reduce the appearance of his crow's feet.

'I don't want it took like as if I have a very stiff face,' he told the outlet. 'I just want to look natural.'

Since men aren't looking to get rid of all of their wrinkles, Dr Rowe said the procedure is relatively painless because of the reduction in injections.

'Sure you can grow old gracefully,' he said. 'But what's gracefully? A few grey hairs and wrinkles are good. The men, they just want to look refreshed.'

Men are also getting Botox injections in their palms and under their arms so they can avoid sweaty handshakes and perspiring through their shirts. 

Botox injections can cost patients $300 or more and the effects last four to six months after treatment.
