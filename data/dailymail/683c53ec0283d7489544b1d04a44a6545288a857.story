Julie Griffiths, who was reportedly sold her pink terraced house in Talke, Staffordshire

A wife from hell who was given an Asbo for shouting at her own husband has thrilled neighbours by packing up and moving house.

But families are now fearing Julie Griffiths and long suffering husband Norman could be moving to a street near them.

Mrs Griffiths, 45, has been taken to court on several occasions, with neighbours complaining  for more than a decade of her loud constant ranting at her husband.

She was originally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting.

But she has been accused of breaching the order three times with earning her the tag NAGSBO.

However, neighbours next to her pink terraced house in Talke, Staffordshire are delighted that the couple are thought to have agreed a £95,000 sale of their home to a housing firm within days of putting it on the market.

One of her neighbours told the Sun: '"I'm happy to say this is the best day of my life — better than my wedding by a mile.'

While another added: 'I'm going to the shop to get the champagne in.'

Neighbours are reported to have watched a removal van enter the street and load up with the couple then leaving in a taxi.

The Griffiths lived in Talke, Staffordshire, with neighbours complaining about her shouting for 10 years

And giving advice to her potential new 
neighbours, another said: 'Today is great for everyone on Church Street —
 but it is the start of a nightmare for some other folk. I hope they 
have industrial-strength sound proofing.'

Complaints have been made against her outbursts since 1999, and it was around thirteen years before she received her Asbo in December 2012.

The ruling prohibited her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties, shouting, screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours.

Mrs Griffiths was riginally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting

Earlier this year she was fined for the noise she made when berating 64-year-old Mr Griffiths for buying the wrong type of scratch card.

This was before a third court appearance where she was accused laying into her partner's hygiene.

Friends say the couple have been 
married for more than 20 years but Griffiths' nagging became an issue 
three years ago. She has been banned from numerous family events because
 of her tantrums.
