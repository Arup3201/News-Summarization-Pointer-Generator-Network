Pippa Middleton has been getting the VIP treatment at an airport baggage reclaim after she arrived in Switzerland.

The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister was spotted looking tired whilst waiting for her suitcase after taking a nine and a half hour flight from Wyoming, U.S.

She waited patiently beside a member of staff from Swissport's VIP department who was ready to push her luggage on a trolley while a second employee watched on.
