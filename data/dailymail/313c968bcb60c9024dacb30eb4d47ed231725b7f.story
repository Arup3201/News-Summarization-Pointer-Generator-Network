Missing schoolgirl Megan Stammers wrote a bucket list of wishes she wanted to fulfill before she died.

In it she included 'fall in love' and 'have someone write a song about me' - both of which had been crossed off.

A total of 50 wishes were posted on her Tumblr page called 'meganneversleeps.'

Wishes she had not yet crossed off included: 'live somewhere outside the U.K', 'go backpacking across Europe', 'get married' and 'trend on Twitter'.

Bucket list: Megan wrote a list of things she wanted to do before she died. One of those things was 'fall in love', which has been crossed off

Megan, 15, and married maths teacher Jeremy Forrest, 30, fled Britain to France just after the police discovered they were in an illicit relationship.

Mr Forrest is an amateur musician who has reportedly written at least one song about Megan called Starsigns.

In August she added Mr Forrest’s song to her 'favourites' selection on a music website.

His lyrics include the lines: 'She’s in my head and I can see there’s trouble ahead. I tried my best but it couldn’t keep me falling.

'She’s dressed in red, she is honest and she’s beautiful. I can’t wait to get her behind closed doors.'

The teenager's aims to 'fall in love' and 'have someone write a song about me' are just two of four wishes which have so far been crossed off.

Another wish that has been fulfilled is 'go to Hollywood'. School friends of Megan had seen her holding hands with Mr Forrest on a flight home from a trip to the US.

Other wishes posted on her Tumblr blog, include those which show off her young age, such as 'learn to drive', 'learn how to skateboard' and 'get my nose pierced'.

Tumblr is a blogging website which allows users to post pictures, videos, links and follow other users.

She also had 'be on the cover of a 
magazine', 'meet Lana Del Ray' and 'be in two places at once' on her 
list of things to achieve in her lifetime.

On the site, in an about me section, she also wrote she adored music and tattoos.

Mr Forrest had an image of a young girl wearing a hat and walking a dog tattooed on his arm earlier this year and also has a floral display on his other arm.
