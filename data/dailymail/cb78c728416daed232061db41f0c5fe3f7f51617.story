the image below may look like a modern art sculpture but this jumble of metallic shapes is actually a bike frame in the making.

The two British firms behind the innovative framework claim they have created the first 3D printed metal bike frame.

Made of titanium alloy, the frame is fresh out of a 3D printer and has been designed to be as light and strong as possible - but the parts still need to be stuck together by hand.

The project is a collaboration between Renishaw – the UK’s only 3D printing manufacturer using metal parts - and bicycle design company Empire Cycles, in the north west of England.

Based on Empire’s MX-6 mountain bike, the frame is printed in titanium alloy and has a tensile strength of over 900MPa.

The frame was designed using topological optimisation, - software to distribute material in the smartest way possible (illustrated)

The new frame is hollow with internal strengthening features and is a third lighter than the original.

It was designed using ‘topological optimisation,’ which means using software to distribute material in the smartest way possible.

‘Material is removed from areas of low stress until a design optimised for load bearing is evolved,’ Renishaw said, so that unneeded material can be eliminated and the bike made lighter.

The frame, which when printed is joined to a metal plate, was broken up and bonded together.

The companies said this allows for flexible design improvements and the process means that a frame can be tailored to an individual’s exact needs.

The bike is not yet on sale and is currently being put through its paces by researchers at Swansea University, who are using strain gauges to measure its performance both in the lab and on mountains.

While in its infancy for metal bike frames, there could come a day when bicycle enthusiasts could easily print out their own frames and other parts to build a bespoke 3D printed bike.

The process was used to determine the most efficient use of titanium for the 3D printed bike frame.

The word comes from the Greek word for place – topo - and topological optimisation software is the term given to programs that are used to determine the ‘logical place’ for material.

It normally involves using iterative steps and element analysis.

Material is removed from areas of low stress until a design optimised for load bearing is evolved.

The resulting model is both light (due to the low volume of material used) and strong.

The two firms worked together on the bike from to design a shape made for additive manufacturing - eliminating many of the downward facing surfaces that would otherwise have needed wasteful support structures.
