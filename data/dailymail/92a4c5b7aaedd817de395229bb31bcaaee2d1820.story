Jailed: Jonathan Revill, 38, defrauded his employers of £19million over the course of three years

An IT manager who defrauded his employers out of £19million to fuel his gambling addiction has been jailed for seven years.

Jonathan Revill, 38, exploited his position at a multinational energy company to order computer equipment which he then sold for a fraction of its worth, using the proceeds to bet online.

He gambled as much as £300,000 on a single sporting fixture and even blew £20,000 in one night after he had been arrested over the deception.

During a three-year period he made £5.6million from selling the equipment, but all he had to show for it was a £500,000  family home in West Yorkshire.

His wife did not learn of his criminal behaviour – or his secret gambling addiction – until he was caught and she was told they would lose their home.

Revill, a father of one, pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to four offences of fraud and three of transferring criminal property – selling goods obtained by crime.

He was employed as a service delivery systems manager at a Leeds-based subsidiary company of GDF Suez – one of the world’s biggest energy companies with a billion-pound turnover.

Mehran Nassiri, prosecuting, said Revill was earning a £55,000 a year with a £400-a-month car allowance but had a ‘serious addiction to gambling’.

Less than a year after he started working for the firm he realised he could place orders that would not be noticed.

Although he was limited to £3,000 purchases without further approval, he forged signatures and over the next three years ordered equipment worth £18,976,000.

It was delivered either to his home in Huddersfield or to a storage unit, Revill then either auctioned it on eBay or sold it for a fraction of its value to one of six companies.

Addiction: Revill once spent £300,000 in a single session of gambling on websites such as Bet365

His deception came to light in May 
when an audit at GDF Suez revealed financial irregularities – but by 
then he had gambled away nearly all of the £5.6million he raised from 
selling the goods.

Jailing 
him for seven years, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: ‘This was a vast 
amount of money.’ He warned Revill that his wife and daughter would now 
have to look for somewhere else to live.

After his arrest, Revill was granted bail on condition that he stopped gambling and sought immediate help for his addiction.

However, on June 2 he accessed more than £20,000 in an Isle of Man-based account and gambled it in a single evening.

Benjamin
Hargreaves, mitigating, said Revill had placed a bet for £11,200 on a 
Roger Federer tennis match and £13,000 on a football match during the 
betting spree. He added: ‘Winning or losing didn’t matter.’

Mr
Hargreaves said Revill had tried to win big to pay back the company and
at one time had £3million in his account ‘trying to get myself out of 
the hole I’d dug’ – but that had gone.

Revill was relieved to be finally caught and was shocked at the total involved, he said.

‘He
accepts over the last ten years a gambling problem has got bigger and 
bigger. The problem is his own and he should have sought help and by his
lies and trying to hide it he brought himself to this.’

Detective
Chief Inspector Mark  Griffin, who heads the Leeds District Proceeds of
Crime Act Team, said: ‘Revill abused his position of trust.

‘His
actions have destroyed his life and affected a number of businesses. 
This case clearly highlights the very serious consequences of gambling 
addiction.’

The court heard
that Revill had built up debts during four months of unemployment 
before starting his job at GDF Suez in April 2009.

He had also been made bankrupt in 2005, but had not told his wife.
