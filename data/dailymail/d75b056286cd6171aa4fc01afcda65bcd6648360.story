When Louis van Gaal was a talented midfielder of just 17, he had to make a choice that would define his entire life.

Making the Ajax first team that at the time boasted the likes of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens or follow his family's wish and train to be a PE teacher.

Van Gaal being Van Gaal, he decided to do 
both. Enrolling at the Academy of Physical Education to attain his 
coaching qualifications, he simultaneously trained with Ajax - and he looked every inch the PE teacher when putting his Manchester United squad through their paces in America.

Hard work, lads? The players certainly looked as if they'd been put through a hard session

The Sun Life Stadium in Miami resembled a 'Boot Camp' as the players were put through a gruelling session of circuit training.

A stopwatch 
and a whistle round his neck, van Gaal wore an unrelenting critical 
glare as his players sprinted and slalomed through cones, lifted weights
 and medicine balls, and took part in resistance training with an 
elasticated band around their waists.

The
 scrutiny was intense. Nobody was allowed to slacken off for a second. 
If they did, he would issue a stern rebuke or send assistant Albert 
Stuivenburg to do it for him.

When the players were granted a pause in the sticky Florida evening they looked knackered.

VIDEO Van Gaal happy with squad  

It has become clear on United's American tour that van Gaal is not only trying to instil a new tactical awareness in his players but also make them the fittest and strongest in the Premier League.

He had no problem with publicly embarrassing new signing Luke Shaw by saying he wasn't fit enough and made him train on his own to catch up. It doesn't matter if you're the new £31m signing.

Even striker
 Robin van Persie, the 'teacher's pet', has been told to prove his 
fitness before being allowed anywhere near the team.  

Instructions
 are short and sharp, delivered in an authoritative tone. He's not 
looking for a discussion, this is what's going to happen.

His biographer Maarten Meijer captures this 'schoolmasterly' approach well in his recent book.

In form: Ashley Young has scored four times on the American tour as he bids for a first team spot 

Thoughtful: Assistant manager Ryan Giggs watches on as the squad train

'The
 experience of daily interacting with often unmotivated or emotionally 
troubled youths at school has given these trainers a cutting edge,' he 
writes.

'This skills can be recognised in the way they deal with their adult charges - pro players - who can be just as testy and demanding as high school boys, and who intermittently require patient understanding and tough discipline.

'Van Gaal's critics are perturbed by what they consider the coach's schoolmasterly style and tone.

'In their view he is still the high school teacher: ever the smart-aleck, autocratic, comfortably convinced of the superiority of his own opinions, and no one should dare to criticise master van Gaal's methodology.'

Van Gaal has always refuted these PE teacher comparisons but, watching him stood, hands planted on hips with an unchanging, unimpressed expression, as his United players are sent round the circuit, it's hard to believe him.

LANGUAGE - Twelve different nationalities are represented in Van Gaal's squad, but they have been told to speak English to each other. Van Gaal himself is fluent in English, Spanish, German and Dutch.

TABLES - Van Gaal sees meal times as a good time for squad bonding, so he has replaced rectangular tables with circular ones to encourage interaction.

MEETINGS - Each night at 10:30pm, Van Gaal sits down with his coaches and senior staff to discuss player progress and plans for the following day.

CAMERAS - High-definition cameras have been installed at United's training ground and they have also been evident on the pre-season tour of America to track the players in training.

NEW PITCHES - Desso training pitches have been laid at Carrington and new trees have been planted to protect them from wind - a problem raised by Van Gaal in his first interview as United manager.
