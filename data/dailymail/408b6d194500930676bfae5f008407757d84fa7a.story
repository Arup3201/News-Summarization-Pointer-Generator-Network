Mental evaluation: John Palowski, 31, allegedly ripped off a man's ear and bit off a bit his face 

A New York man ripped off a man's ear and bit off part of his face in an unprovoked attack, said police

Police in the town of Evans, southwest of Buffalo, shocked John Palowski, 31, with a stun gun on Tuesday when they found two men wrestling on the front lawn of a home.

Palowski was taken to Erie County Medical Center for a mental evaluation and he was charged with assault in the first degree - a Class-B felony - reckless endangerment 2nd degree and three counts of Harassment.  

A caretaker of one of the estates was working outside when Palowski aggressively approached him and attacked him, Evans Police Chief Ernest Masullo, told MailOnline. 

The caretaker managed to tackle Palowski to the ground and asked him, 'who are you?' and 'why are you doing this to me', he added.

After some struggle, Palowski promised to stop fighting with the caretaker and said, 'OK. let me up,' vowing not to jump at him again. The very moment that the caretaker let the crazed man out of his control, Palowski viciously attacked him, ripping his ear away from his skull and biting off a piece of his face, Masullo claimed.

The caretaker was rushed to an urgent care center and will undergo plastic surgery to fix the side of  his face that was damaged in the alleged assault.

Palowski suffered from bruised ribs.

'Palowski is well known in the town of Evans,' Masullo told MailOnline.

Palowski served six months in jail on a weapons charge in 2007 after he threatened Evans police officers with a loaded handgun after a high-speed chase.  

Police were able to take Palowski into custody and discovered a handmade grenade in his pocket, said Masullo. 

Police: Evans Police Chief Ernest Masullo told MailOnline that John Palowski is no stranger to Evans law enforcement and was convicted in 2007 for threatening police with a gun after a high speed car chase

'The subject led the officers on a high speed chase which ended when the subject ran off the road. When the officers approached the vehicle, the subject had a loaded 357 magnum on his lap which he intended to use to shoot the officers,' said a police statement on the incident. 

'He was convinced not to shoot the officers by his female passenger. When the officers removed him from the vehicle they also found that the subject had a homemade grenade on him. A subsequent search of the defendant’s vehicle and his residence officers found several other loaded handguns along with bomb making equipment'.

Masullo told MailOnline that in 2007 Palowski took a plea deal that included co-operating with mental health professionals until his probation ended on March 2014.

Between March and now Paloswski has not been under mental supervision, despite his history of mental illness. 

Masullo did not specify what type of mental problem Palowski suffers from but says he desperately needs treatment for his well-being and for the safety of Evans.
