Former royal aide Benjamin Herman aged 79,  has appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates Court charged with assaulting a young girl whilst working at Buckingham Palace

The Duke of Edinburgh's former aide has appeared in court accused of sexually abusing a young girl in the early 1970s while he worked at Buckingham Palace.

Benjamin Herman, 79, appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates Court today charged with three counts of indecent assault on a girl aged under 14 and one of attempted indecent assault on a girl aged under 16.

They are alleged to have been carried out on a girl aged 12 in 1972 at a house in London used by military personnel where Herman was living at the time, the court heard.

Herman was a serving major in the Royal Marines at the time of the alleged offences.

He was on secondment as equerry - a personal assistant - to Philip, prosecutor Frances Lockhart told the court.

Herman, of Hook, Hampshire, was tanned and smartly dressed in a navy suit and tie as he appeared in the dock.

Speaking only to confirm his details, he was later released on conditional bail to appear at Kingston Court on August 18.

Herman, a grandfather, appeared in a pressed dark blue suit with a white pocket square, white shirt and blue tie with combed white hair and a tanned face.

He stood up in the dock at Wimbledon Crown Court to confirm his name to District Judge, James Henderson, speaking up to say 'thank you, Sir' when the judge released him on bail at the end of today’s 15 minute hearing. He is next due to appear at Kingston Crown Court on August 18th.

Frances Lockhart, prosecuting, told the court: 'These are historical allegations of sexual assault on a 12-year-old girl around 40 years ago.

'It happened over 40 years ago at the defendants’s house which was a military property, or residential property for military personnel and their families in south west London.

'The complainant lived in one of these properties at the time. Herman was a serving member of the Royal Marines and had a post as Equerry to Prince Philip.

'These allegations are over four separate incidents of sexual assault over a year period.

'The crown are saying that this should be sent to crown court because of the serious nature of the offences.

'The complainant was 12 years old at the time, the defendant was 38-years-old and was a person in a position of responsibility.

'There were four alleged incidents over a period of time and there were elements of grooming. 

'There was touching involved under clothing and there was an attempt to make her touch his penis.

'There was also a kissing incident when she was once naked under a bath robe.'

The offences are alleged to have been carried out on a girl aged 12 in 1972 at a house in London used by military personnel where Herman was living at the time, the court heard

Once sent from the 40 Commando Royal Marines, where he served as a Lieutenant-Colonel, Herman served as the Equerry-in-waiting to the Duke of Edinburgh before becoming Princess Anne’s private secretary for two years in the early 1970s.

Scotland
 Yard confirmed last week that Herman had been arrested on February 28th
 this year when CID in Wandsworth, south west London, were investigating
 allegations of sexual assault.

Herman has been charged with three counts of indecent assault and one of attempted assault on the girl between 1972 and 1974. At the time of the alleged offences, he worked at Buckingham Palace (above)

Police also said the alleged victim, who is now in her 50s, came forward in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The
 ex-aide, who was made a Military Assistant and Aide-de-Camp to the 
Commandant General in the Marines, lived at Windsor in Berkshire during 
the period of the alleged offences and was also posted at Wellington 
Barracks near Buckingham Palace.
