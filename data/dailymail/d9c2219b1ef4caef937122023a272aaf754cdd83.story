Germany forward Lukas Podolski believes the pressure is all on Brazil heading into Tuesday night's World Cup semi-final.

The Germans are many people's favourites to lift the World Cup on July 13 due to their fine form and the fact that Brazil's star man Neymar has been ruled out by injury.

And Podolski told the Sunday Telegraph that it is Brazil, not Germany, who will be feeling the heat in Belo Horizonte.

'Brazil have the pressure because they are playing at home,' said the 29-year-old Arsenal man.

'If we play against 70,000-80,000 Brazilian fans in the stadium, it's OK. Every one of us plays away from home in big games. When you play at Tottenham, you are used to this - or in front of 40,000-50,000 at Liverpool as well.'

Podolski, who has appeared twice in the tournament so far, believes it is Germany's year.

'We were close in 2010 and 2006 and we lost in the semi-final and now I have the feeling we are closer than we were in the last World Cups,' explained Podolski, who played in both those games.

'We have this feeling. We are very close - everybody in the squad. You feel everybody wants it. We have a big opportunity to win the title now. In previous years we have been close but now we want this so much.'
