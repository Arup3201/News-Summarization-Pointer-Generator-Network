Aaron Hernandez is being sued for $12million by the families of two men he's suspected of murdering in 2012, it emerged today.

The families of Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were found shot to death in Boston two years ago filed the wrongful death lawsuits Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court.

Each seeks $6 million from the former New England Patriots player.

The men were sitting in an SUV in the city's South End in July 2012 when another SUV pulled up and someone inside opened fire.

Wrongful death: Aaron Hernandez, pictured in September, 2013, has been hit with wrongful death lawsuits for two shooting 2012 deaths just days after he was after he was accused of brutally beating an inmate in prison

Nobody has been criminally charged with their deaths, but Hernandez has been identified by police as a suspect.

The 24-year-old Hernandez is being held without bail after pleading not guilty to murder in the unrelated death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd in North Attleborough.

Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.

Hernandez is now facing four lawsuits, including one by Lloyd's family and another by a former friend who alleges Hernandez shot him in the face.

Earlier last week, the football players allegedly beat a fellow inmate while he was wearing handcuffs and could not defend himself.

The former tight end has been separated from other prisoners at the Bristol County jail in Massachusetts since his arrest, but on Tuesday he was allowed to walk down into a common area.

Although usually only one inmate is allowed into this area at any time, Hernandez encountered another inmate who began harassing him, TMZ Sports reported.

Hernandez, who was not wearing handcuffs, turned on him and the man, whose hands were restrained, was unable to defend himself, according to the website.

Hernandez allegedly lunged at the unnamed man and severely beat him up.

'It was very brief,' Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said of the fight. 'The officers were right there and it was stopped within seconds, maybe a minute.'

Neither required medical attention after the scrap.

jail staff are interviewing witnesses and reviewing surveillance video to figure out exactly what happened and determine whether disciplinary measures or even criminal charges are warranted. They are also investigating how the men came to be in the area at the same time.

Hodgson said he did not know of any previous tension between the two men.

'We don't know what, if any, relationship there was or has been at any point, either here or anywhere else,' Hodgson said.

Both Hernandez and the other inmate have been moved to other units until the investigation is completed.
