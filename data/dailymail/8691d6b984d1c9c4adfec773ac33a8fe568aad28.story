Tragedy: Lydia Bishop died in September 2012 on her first day at nursery, after telling her bereft mother she loved her

The mother of a three-year-old who died after becoming entangled in a rope on her first full day of nursery said today her daughter's last words to her were: 'I love you Mummy, see you later.'

Lydia Bishop died on September 17, 2012, after she was found on the slide at York College nursery, which had 'fundamental flaws' in its health and safety procedures, Leeds Crown Court has been told.

Nursery worker Sophee Redhead, 25, is standing trial for Lydia's manslaughter by gross negligence.

Prosecutor Robert Smith QC has claimed Redhead saw the child walk towards the slide - but left Lydia 'to her own devices' for up to 20 minutes.

The jury has been read a statement from Lydia's mother, Rebecca Dick, who was rushed in a police car to York Hospital's A&E, where medical staff were trying to revive her daughter.

The jury has also heard that a visitor to the college, Saffron Stockwell, later told police she had seen a child lying motionless on the slide - but did not see any staff member in the outside play area.

Rebecca Dick's statement, read to the jury, said: '[Lydia] asked me to bring her sweets for being good and said: "I love you Mummy, see you later".'

But six hours later, Miss Dick recalled, she was called out of her course and rushed in a police car to hospital.

'It quickly became apparent that Lydia wasn't responding to any medical treatment. The doctor decided that she had died,' the statement said.

She had difficulty realising that Lydia was dead, she said. 'Eventually I was allowed to take Lydia into a private room where we could be together.'

Incident: Lydia Bishop was found blue and not breathing after she got her neck caught in a rope on a slide in the outdoor play area at York College's nursery, pictured, Leeds Crown Court heard

The jury have heard that staff member Redhead had found Lydia shortly before 2:30pm lying unconscious and not breathing on a play slide.

On trial: Sophee Redhead arriving at Leeds Crown Court last week, has denied a charge of manslaughter over the death of the three-year-old girl

She went on a half-day trial run there on September 10, 2012, a week before her death.

When she went to collect her at the end of the afternoon, Lydia was sitting listening to a story.

'It was quite obvious that Lydia was enjoying herself and was in no rush to leave,' her mother said.

On September 17, Lydia's parents took her to the nursery, where she arrived at 9am.

Shortly after 3pm, a woman entered her classroom and took her hurriedly to the nursery.

'There were no children around. It seemed a little strange,' Mrs Dick's statement said. She was told Lydia had been involved in an accident and was taken to the hospital.

A visitor to the college, Saffron Stockwell, later told police she had seen a child lying motionless with her hands by her side and her eyes closed halfway down the slide in the nursery's outside play area as she approached the college car park at 2:30pm.

The jury heard she had not seen any staff member anywhere in the outside play area. She didn't tell anyone at the time because her own daughter sometimes played a game in which she lay in a similar way on a slide.

Bosses: York College - which operated the nursery for children of staff, students and members of the public - denies failing to ensure people not in their employment are not exposed to a risk to their health and safety

Dr Anthony Powell, whose two children went to the nursery, told the jury its care was 'first class' and he had been 'astounded' to hear of the accident.

Redhead, of York, denies manslaughter by gross negligence. She also denies an alternative charge of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of persons at work.

York College denies a charge of failing to conduct an undertaking in such a way as to ensure persons not in their employment were not exposed to risks to health and safety.

The trial continues.
