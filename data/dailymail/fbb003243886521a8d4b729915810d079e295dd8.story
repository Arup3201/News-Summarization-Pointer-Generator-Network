Fatherhood appears to have done little to slow world number one Novak Djokovic as he got off to a winning start at the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris on Tuesday.

Djokovic, whose wife Jelena gave birth to a baby boy Stefan last week, comfortably saw off Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 in their second-round tie.

'It feels great! It's different, obviously,' Djokovic told Sky Sports. 'I'm trying to take as much positive energy as I can from what's happened in the past few weeks. I'm very proud to be a father and I'm very proud of my wife for handling the birth in a great way.

'She's back home recovering now, with our little boy. This was my first match as a father and it can only inspire me to play my best tennis.'

It was a 53rd win of the season for Djokovic, the defending champion here, as he bids to retain his top ranking ahead of Rafael Nadal.

Fifth seed Tomas Berdych had a much harder time as he battled his way past Adrian Mannarino, eventually winning 6-4 6-7 (3/7) 6-2 in a match that lasted 2 hours 22 minutes.

Fourteenth seed Kevin Anderson advanced with a hard-fought 6-4 7-6 (10/8) win over Santiago Giraldo, but there was an early exit for number 15 Gilles Simon, beaten 6-3 3-6 6-4 by Fernando Verdasco.
