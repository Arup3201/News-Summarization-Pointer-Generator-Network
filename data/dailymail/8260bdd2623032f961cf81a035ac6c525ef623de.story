President Obama took a break from the golf course during his Hawaii vacation yesterday to make a brief visit to his grandfather's grave.

The president, who has played eight rounds of golf since arriving on December 20, spent just four minutes at the grave of Stanley Dunham.

His motorcade then left the National Memorial Cemetery and took Mr Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha to the zoo for a private tour.

It took 30 minutes for the First Family to be driven from their vacation home to the cemetery, where they stayed for just a few minutes, according to the Weekly Standard.

As he visited the grave, Mr Obama could not be seen by the press pool following him on the 17-day vacation.

Mr Dunham became a father figure to the president as he was growing up, after his own father left. The Second World War veteran died, aged 73, in 1992.

The White House pool report recorded the visit, stating: 'President Obama's motorcade made its way 
to Honolulu, passing by stunning vistas while occasionally being slowed 
by congested roads.'

It added: 'After a 30-minute drive, Obama and daughters Sasha 
and Malia arrived at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at 
Puowaina Punchbowl Crater.'

The family went on to Honolulu Zoo, 
arriving just after 5pm for what is believed to have been a private 
visit as the tourist attraction closes at 4.30pm.

Earlier in the day the President was pictured playing golf with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key today.

The
 two leaders teed off on a sunny and breezy morning at a course at a 
military base on Oahu, the Hawaiian island where Obama is renting a 
vacation home.

New Zealand media has reported that Mr Key owns a home in Hawaii.

In the hot seat: President Obama generally plays golf with close friends, and on rare occasions, political allies, but Mr Key is now one of the few foreign leaders who can add his name to the list

The golf outing put Mr Key in rarified company as President Obama, an avid golfer, prefers to limit his playing partners to a close circle of friends and advisers.

Among those who have also scored invitations to play with Mr Obama in the past are former President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker John Boehner.

Rounding out the foursome Thursday were Max Key, the prime minister's teenage son, and Marvin Nicholson, Mr Obama's personal aide.

Media access to Mr Obama's rounds is typically restricted, though reporters and photographers were permitted to briefly watch the two leaders Thursday.Â
