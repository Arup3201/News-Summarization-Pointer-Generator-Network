Hero: Friends have identified Jon Meis, a 26-year-old engineering student, as the hero who stopped the gunman

A 26-year-old gunman has opened fire at a small, Christian university in Seattle - killing one student and wounding three more with shotgun blasts.

And police say he could have killed others if it wasn't for the actions of one heroic student who pepper sprayed the gunman and tackled him to the ground.

Students at Seattle Pacific University say Jon Meis saved countless lives when he sprang into action as the shooter stopped to reload his weapon Thursday afternoon.

Meis, a 26-year-old engineering student, is engaged to be married and has 'everything to live for' friends said. But he risked his life and ended the murderous rampage.

'I'm proud of the selfless actions that my roommate, Jon Meis, showed today taking down the shooter. He is a hero,' tweeted Matt Garcia.

Classmate Briana Clarke told the Seattle Times that Meis, who was on duty as a hall monitor, sprayed the attacker in the face, grabbed him around the neck and then wrestled him to the ground.

'There were a lot of shells on the ground..it looked like he was planning to go the distance and Jon stopped him,' another student told KOMO-TV.

Several other students then piled on the attacker and held him until police arrived.

'But
 for the great response for the people at Seattle Pacific this incident 
would have been much more tragic,' assistant police chief Paul McDonagh 
said Thursday night.

KING-TV reports that Ybarra lives with his parents in the Seattle area. He has reportedly confessed to the 
shootings and even bragged about the carnage he inflicted on the campus.
 Authorities say he did not expect to survive the rampage.

His Facebook page says he is a former janitor at LA Fitness and attended Edmonds Community College.

In the panic, police believed there was a
 second shooter and searched for up to an hour, possibly delaying 
medical attention for the wounded, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports.
