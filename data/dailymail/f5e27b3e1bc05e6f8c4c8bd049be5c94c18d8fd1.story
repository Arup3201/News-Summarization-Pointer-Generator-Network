A racist Everton fan who called one player a 'f***ing black monkey' and another a 'chink' has been fined £2,500 and banned from entering sports stadiums for three years.

William Blything, 41, hurled insults at Toffees midfielder Victor Anichebe in front of his own wife, two children and three-year-old grandson.

He also called QPR midfielder Ji Sung Park 'a f***ing chink' during the same match, West London Magistrates' Court heard.

Hurled abuse: William Blything has been fined £2,500 and banned from entering sporting arenas after he yelled racial abuse at players in front of his family at a match last year

The merchant seaman from Wavertree, Liverpool was arrested when a complaint was made after the 1-1 draw between QPR and Everton at Loftus Road stadium, in Shepherd's Bush, London on October 21 last year.

He shocked fellow Everton fan Neil Jordan so much that he tweeted a photo of Blything captioned 'racist tw*t' after hearing the abuse.

Mr Jordan told the court: 'I was appalled because it wasn't just an isolated incident, there was some intent targeted at that player because of the colour of his skin.

Racial abuse: Fellow Everton fan Neil Jordan told the court he heard Blything yell 'Victor you f***ing black monkey' at Everton midfielder Victor Anichebe (pictured challenging Aston Villa's Ciaran Clark earlier this year)

'Not an isolated incident': Blything also called QPR midfielder Ji Sung Park a 'f***ing chink' during the same match

'I heard him again say "Victor you f***ing black monkey".

'That was the straw that broke the camel's back, I suppose. I was outraged and left my seat to find a steward.'

Speaking
in a West Country accent, Blything, who defended himself, argued that 
the alleged abuse was yelled in a Liverpool accent.

Angrily
cross-examining Mr Jordan he said: 'You have heard abuse and you have 
turned around and taken a picture of me and put it on twitter. You have 
defamed my character.'

Another
fan, John Murnane, also heard Blything abuse at Anichebe and shout 
'take down that chink' at Park, a South Korean international who was 
captaining QPR that game.

Mr Murnane said he was encouraged to report the incident by the Kick It Out campaign.

He
said: 'I was appalled. I have been to Everton matches with a black 
friend before and I could imagine what she would have felt. I have been 
to many football matches but this was exceptional.

'With the campaign that had been going on I felt not only aggrieved but I felt like complaining about it.'

Blything attended the game with his wife, his two children aged 11 and 16, and his three-year-old grandson, the court heard.

Before
the match, QPR defender Anton Ferdinand and other teammates had 
controversially refused to wear a t-shirt from anti-racism group Kick It
Out.

Blything was last 
month found guilty of causing racially aggravated intentional 
harassment, alarm and distress under the Crime and Disorder Act 1988.

He was fined £2,500 and was made subject to a three year football banning order preventing him from entering any sporting arena.

Blything was also ordered to pay £600 in court costs as well as £120 to the victim in compensation.
