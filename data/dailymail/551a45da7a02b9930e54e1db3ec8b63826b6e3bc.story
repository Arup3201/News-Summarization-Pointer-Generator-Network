Coleen Rooney has claimed her designer luggage was 'ransacked' after arriving two days late in Las Vegas from Heathrow, as British Airways admits thousands of passengers have been caught up in baggage chaos. 

The 28-year-old wife of England striker Wayne Rooney flew with BA to Sin City on Saturday for a family holiday.

But after her luggage arrived two days late, she tweeted: 'Feel sick..... just received my 4 cases 2
 days late from BA Heathrow to Las Vegas. Opened them all and they have 
been completely ransacked.'

Mrs Rooney is not the only passenger out of Heathrow to experience problems with baggage over the last week.

A
 fault with the system in Terminal Five means thousands of bags have 
been left grounded while their owners continued to their destinations.

Euan Fordyce, a spokesman for British Airways, told Yahoo Travel that the baggage had not been 'lost' but merely 'missed its flight.'

He said: 'I do not have a total figure, but it has been in the thousands, as the problem happened across a number of days.'

The
 problem hit the airport on Thursday when a computer glitch caused the 
conveyor belts that loads bags onto planes to shut down.

Baggage handlers tried to put the cases onto the aircraft manually but 
were unable to keep pace with the flight schedule, meaning many left 
without being fully loaded.

Heathrow declined to comment on Mrs Rooney’s situation but British Airways said they had contacted Mrs Rooney to begin an investigation into the incident.  And a spokesman told MailOnline the wider baggage problem should be sorted by the end of today, by which time they believed the last of the remaining bags would have been shipped on from Heathrow.

Mrs Rooney faced a 
string of sarcastic comments from some of her followers who commented that she could probably afford to replace the items.

But 
she angrily replied that the money wasn't the issue, tweeting: ‘And you 
can stick all the sarcastic comments about money. It’s not all about 
money it’s about people going through my personal stuff and taking stuff
 that I need for my holiday’.

She has also received messages of 
support from fans, retweeting a post from one, who wrote: ‘That is 
disgraceful, complete invasion of your privacy!! You’re a paying 
customer so should be treated the same as any other.’

The couple are staying at the luxurious Encore Beach Club while the footballer enjoys a break before heading back to training with Manchester United.

Rooney was heavily criticised for his performances at the World Cup in Brazil but at least managed to assist in both of the goals England achieved at the tournament.

It is set to be another big season for the striker as he starts to work under Manchester United's new manager, Louis van Gaal.

BA told MailOnline: 'We are very sorry. We are contacting Mrs Rooney to apologise and have begun a full investigation.'

Despite her woes, Coleen has been seen wearing a classic black bikini by the pool, accessorised with a delicate necklace and tortoiseshell sunglasses.

The mother-of-two seemed to constantly have a drink in hand as the group topped up their tans in the glorious sunshine.
