There’s nothing quite like biting into a warm, soft cookie oozing with chocolate.

Mankind has spent decades trying to create the perfect recipe, but often no two batches are ever the same.

Now, in his quest to create a flawless confectionary, an engineer from San Francisco has developed what could be the holy grail of cookie-making.

Scroll down for video…

Ben Krasnow has created a machine (pictured) that mixes the perfect amount of each baking ingredient to make a single cookie. Using specially-designed software, the recipe of every single cookie can be tweaked to different preferences

Ben Krasnow has created a machine that mixes the perfect amount of each baking ingredient to make a single cookie.

Using specially-designed software, the recipe of every single cookie can be tweaked to different preferences.

For those who like their cookie chewier, they move the slider on the software which sends a signal to the machine to release more flour.

The single-serving cookie machine claims to measure the ingredients completely accurately each time.

‘This machine allows me to mix a single cookie and vary the recipe for each cookie on the sheet,' said Mr Krasnow in his blog.

'Hence, I can test many different recipe variations with one batch of ingredients in one afternoon’ 

This machine would be welcome news to Serious Eats Chief Creative Officer James Kenji Lopez-Alt who last month baked 1,536 cookies in his quest to find his personal perfect chocolate chip cookie.

But for some, a major downside is that the machine creates only one cookie at a time.

This means you’ll no longer be able to secretly feast on those cookies that ‘didn’t make the grade’.
