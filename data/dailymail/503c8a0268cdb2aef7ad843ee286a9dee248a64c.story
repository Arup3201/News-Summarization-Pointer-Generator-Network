Mr Stowe has reportedly been sacked from his position as Fair Trading Commissioner

Two business owners in NSW face hefty fines and prosecution after Fair Trading discovered knock-off phone chargers similar to the one which killed a young mother earlier this year.

The Sydney Morning Herald report that more than 260 raids took place this week and the two shop owners could face up to $87,500 in fines and a possible two years in jail.

Fair Trading also apparently found a dozen businesses selling dodgy chargers and adapters, and undercover officers discovered six stalls at Paddy's markets Haymarket and Dapto markets on the NSW south coast.

Also in the spotlight is consumer watchdog boss Rod Stowe, who has reportedly been stood down from his position as NSW Fair Trading Commissioner in the aftermath of the death of Sheryl Anne Aldeguer, 28, who was electrocuted by a faulty USB charger at her Gosford home.

Daily Mail Australia has been told that Mr Stowe has taken leave just 10 days after it was revealed the young mother-of-two, who had moved from the Philippines to Australia for work, was killed as a result of the faulty USB charger which electrocuted her on April 23.

It led NSW Fair Trading to issue an alert advising against buying the rip-off chargers which Commissioner Rod Stowe declared 'may not meet Australian safety standards' because the devices 'pose a serious risk of electrocution or fire.'

But now more than a week on, Mr Stowe has reportedly left the top job despite no one confirming reports by the Sunday Telegraph that he had been sacked.

Several spokespeople from NSW Fair Trading and The Department of Finance and Services have confirmed that Assistant Commissioner John Tansey had been put in his place, but there appears to be a lack of information available as to why he has suddenly been appointed as Mr Stowe's replacement.

Daily Mail Australia contacted a spokesperson for the Department Finance and Services who said he was not commenting any further other than to say 'Fair Trading Commissioner, Rod Stowe, is on leave. During this time, John Tansey will act as Fair Trading Commissioner.'

A police investigation revealed on June 26 that it was a USB charger, and not a laptop as first suspected, which led to 28-year-old Sheryl Aldegur's death on the NSW Central Coast.

The stall owners face fines of $87,500 and/or two years imprisonment and Mr Stowe said at the time the penalty was a 'wake-up call to people who buy cheap electronic products without realising potential hazards.'

Fair Trading Electrical Product Safety Expert Lynelle Collins also said it had been five years since a similar death caused by a faulty electronic device but there was a serious risk of further deaths.

'Particularly with the Internet, people can buy stuff directly from overseas wholesalers that may not meet Australian safety standards,' she said.

Meanwhile, two NSW Fair Trading media advisors, who were also contacted for comment regarding Mr Stowe's 'leave' arrangements, told the Daily Mail Australia they had been 'instructed' to direct inquiries to Melissah Bell, herself listed as a 'media contact' on the Fair Trading website.

Ms Bell said Mr Stowe's leave arrangements are a matter for the Office of Finance and Services and would not comment on whether or not the leave was indefinite.

'There is nothing more I can tell you at this stage,' she said.
