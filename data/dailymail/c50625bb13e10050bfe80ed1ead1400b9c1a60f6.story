Christian victory: Nearly every supermarket will this year stock The Real Easter Egg for the first time this year

Christian groups have won a victory in their campaign for shops to sell a religious Easter egg.

Nearly every major supermarket will for the first time this year stock the Real Easter Egg – the only one to mention Jesus on its packaging.

Customers and bishops have lobbied them for three years to stock the £3.99 egg.

They all turned the product away when it was launched in 2010, but Waitrose, Morrisons and the Co-op signed up to trial the eggs in 2011 and 2012.

Now Sainsbury's and Tesco have joined them – a decision church leaders described as 'a milestone'.

Asda is the only major chain not to stock the egg, the box of which explains the religious significance of Easter and contains an activity for children.

The Meaningful Chocolate Company expects to sell more than 200,000 of the religious eggs. Around 80 million Easter eggs are sold each year in the UK.

Sainsbury's and Waitrose will stock just 12 eggs at a small numbers of stores. Tesco is the biggest stockist and will sell the eggs out of 450 of its largest stores.

A spokesman for the Meaningful Chocolate Company, which makes the egg, said the supermarket had 'never replied' to multiple calls and emails.

The Meaningful Chocolate Company expects most of its sales will be by mail order and through independent shops, with the remainder made up by supermarkets.

Individuals, schools and churches have ordered as many as 200 of the religious eggs at a time.

The Bishop of Hereford, the Rt Revd Anthony Priddis, said: 'I wrote to the supermarkets last year encouraging them to stock The Real Easter Egg.

'I am delighted they have taken the challenge seriously. The response from Tesco, Morrisons and the Coop has been particularly encouraging.

'I am sure Sainsbury and Waitrose will also discover real demand for an egg explaining the religious understanding of Easter on the box and which supports charitable projects. I encourage shoppers to hunt out a Real Easter Egg and complain if they are not being stocked.'

David Marshall, from the Meaningful Chocolate Company, said: 'Our aim is to change the Easter egg market forever by making it more spiritual, more generous and more faithful.'

All profits from the egg will go to the charity.
