Robots may well replace factory workers over the next decade, but they don't pose a serious threat to middle class jobs, claims billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel.

Venture capitalist Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and was early backer of Facebook, dismissed claims that machines pose an imminent threat to American workers.

'Middle class jobs in the U.S. are not threatened by artificially-intelligent robots. That's like science fiction. It might happen in 100 years, maybe never,' he said on Tuesday at The Economist's Buttonwood Gathering.

Robots may well replace factory workers over the next decade, but they don't pose a threat to middle class jobs for at least one hundred years, claims billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel

The Silicon Valley entrepreneur also said middle class jobs were threatened more by globalization, not technology.

'I'm not against globalization, but we should be very clear that that's the force of pressure on the middle class. It's not this scapegoat called technology,' he said, reports CNN Money. 

New research from the Boston Consult Group released this week claims that the falling cost of industrial robots will allow manufacturers to use them to replace more factory workers over the next decade.

Robots now perform roughly 10 percent of manufacturing tasks that can be done by machines.

The management consulting firm projected that to rise to about 25 percent of such 'automatable' tasks by 2025.

In turn, labor costs stand to drop by 16 percent on average globally over that time, according to the research.

Robots now perform 10 percent of manufacturing tasks that can be done by machines, according to the Boston Consulting Group, which says this will rise to about 25 per cent by 2025

The shift will mean an increasing demand for skilled workers who can operate the machines, said Hal Sirkin, a senior partner at Boston Consulting.

Factory workers 'will be higher paid but there will be fewer of them,' Sirkin said.

The research found a tipping point for installing robots: Companies tend to start thinking about replacing workers when the costs of owning and operating a system come at a 15 percent discount to employing a human counterpart.

For example, in the U.S. automotive industry, which is predicted to be one of the more aggressive adopters of robots, a spot-welding machine costs $8 an hour versus $25 an hour for a worker.

A robot that can perform certain repetitive tasks costs about one-tenth as much as it did more than 10 years ago, Sirkin said.

Costs tied to one commonly used robotics system, a spot welder, are expected to fall 22 percent between now and 2025.

Three-fourths of robot installations over the next decade are expected to be concentrated in four areas: transportation equipment, including the automotive sector; computer and electronic products; electrical equipment and machinery.

Certain countries also are expected to be more briskadopters. China, the United States, Japan, Germany and South Korea now account for about 80 percent of robot purchases and are expected to maintain that share over the next decade

21st century traffic warden: Research showed that images produced droids could give out parking tickets

According to Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a research fellow in UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies,  care for the elderly and even children are among the jobs to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings within the next 50 years.

Her research suggests human workers across a plethora of service sectors and caring professions could be replaced by droids within our lifetimes.

She believes that as the rapid advances in technology achieved this century are projected to continue at an astonishing rate, this will allow robots to break free of science fiction and establish themselves in our everyday life.

According to her research - which polled 2,000 people about which jobs they thought were most unpopular and could be among the first to be given to robots for the TC channel Syfy - traffic wardens (65 per cent), estate agents (40 per cent) and car salesman (33 per cent) could soon be lost to history.

By 2025, robots should be able to handle 30 to 40 percent of automatable tasks in these industries.

Adoption will be slower in industries such as food products, plastics, fabricated metal, and wood products, where many tasks will remain difficult to automate and wages are relatively low.

Thanks to technological advances, however, robots are making greater inroads in these industries as well.

'Regardless of whether it's time to invest in next-generation robots, manufacturers everywhere should start preparing,' added Sirkin.

'They need to understand how costs and automation technologies are changing in their industries and what their competitors are up to.

Stark warning: Professor Stephen Hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence

Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'.

Now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity.

The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. 

The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind.

The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society.

It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research.

'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write.

But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak.

For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work.

In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming.
