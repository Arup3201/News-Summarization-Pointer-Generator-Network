Alastair Cook has been sacked as England one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, the ECB confirmed on Saturday morning.

Only a few days after insisting Cook would lead the team at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February, England have performed a spectacular U-turn and removed him.

He has paid the price for a prolonged run of poor 50-over form, which has seen England lose six of their last seven one-day series.

Questions were again asked of his leadership as England slumped to a 5-2 series defeat in Sri Lanka over the last few weeks.

Cook's form has dropped off dramatically, with the opener averaging just 30 over the last two years at a pedestrian strike rate of 73.

A statement released by the ECB on Saturday morning read: 'ECB today announced that Eoin Morgan has replaced Alastair Cook as England One-Day captain with immediate effect.

'England selectors met yesterday to pick a 15-man one-day squad for the tour to Australia and the ICC Cricket World Cup. 

'Selectors recommended to Managing Director England Cricket Paul Downton a change in captaincy which has now been approved by the ECB Chairman. Cook will continue as England Test captain.

'Morgan has captained England’s one-day side on eight previous occasions. The 28 year old left hander, who made his England debut in 2009, will lead the side in a tri-series against Australia and India in January ahead of the ICC Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand beginning in February.

'James Whitaker, National Selector, said: 'We spent a considerable time yesterday discussing the make up of a squad that gives England the best possible chance of success at the World Cup which begins in less than two months. 

'Having reviewed the recent series against Sri Lanka we came to the conclusion that there was no place for Alastair Cook amongst our strongest 15 one-day players and therefore recommended Eoin Morgan be appointed One-Day captain.'

'Paul Downton, Managing Director England Cricket, said: 'I have complete confidence in the decision made by the selectors and having spent time with Alastair yesterday he accepts that it has been made in the best interests of the one-day side.

Alastair Cook admitted he was 'gutted' to be left out of the World Cup squad

Eoin Morgan described his appointment as a 'huge honour' but has plenty of work to do

Snatching Cook's captaincy away was not a brave decision... the selectors should be red-faced  

'Eoin has held a senior role in our limited overs teams for some time and has impressed on the occasions he has led the side. I would like to congratulate him on the appointment and wish him, Peter Moores and the rest of the squad all the very best over the next three months.

'Alastair remains an integral part of England cricket and continues to have a vital role in developing our emerging Test side. I would like to thank him for his leadership of the one-day side since 2011, a period which saw the team reach number one in the world. 

'Alastair led the team to more wins than any previous England captain and also make the final of the ICC Champions Trophy. 

'Alastair will now focus on an exciting and challenging year of Test cricket beginning with a series against West Indies followed by an Ashes summer culminating in a series against South Africa next winter.'

Eoin Morgan said: 'It is a huge honour to captain England and I am delighted to be leading the one-day side. I firmly believe that with the players currently involved in the one-day set up we have the makings of a very good one-day side, a young side that can surprise people at the World Cup. 

'We all recognise we still have a lot of work to do on our one-day game but the potential of this group of players is huge and it is now up to us as players to turn that potential into consistent performances on the international stage starting next month against Australia and India.'

'Alastair Cook said: 'I am gutted to be left out of the World Cup squad and it is likely to take me a while to get over the disappointment. That said I wish Peter, Eoin and the lads all the best for the World Cup. I would also like to thank all the players and fans who have supported me during my time as One-Day captain.'

Nasser Hussain told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch Alastair Cook 

Yet the decision still comes as a shock to many, especially after the ECB stuck with Cook through a traumatic year for English cricket.

Last Sunday England coach Peter Moores, who has backed Cook emphatically since replacing Andy Flower in April, said ahead of England’s last one-day international in Sri Lanka: ‘If you ask my opinion, Cook will be captain at the World Cup.’

Then on Monday, just before England’s last defeat in their 5-2 series loss, managing director Paul Downton added: ‘I would be extremely surprised if he’s not captain at the World Cup.’

Now, with England leaving for a triangular series against Australia and India ahead of the World Cup in just over a fortnight, the selectors have risked embarrassment by flying in the face of that faith they showed in Cook.

Moores met fellow selectors James Whitaker and Mick Newell at Loughborough on Friday, while Angus Fraser joined them via a conference call from his holiday home in Barbados and Downton sat in as a non-voting presence.

They ultimately reached their decision because of Cook’s inability to make a single decent score in the seven-match series in Sri Lanka even though they knew conditions there were never going to suit him.

And the sense of England being in a state of one-day turmoil is added to by the fact that they will replace Cook with a batsman in Morgan who has a worse one-day record throughout this year than the man he succeeds.

At least Irishman Morgan, such a key performer in England’s one-day batting, seems to be galvanised by leadership — he has scored 427 runs at an average of 71 in eight previous matches as one-day captain.

Cook, nothing if not a stubborn fighter, was said to be bitterly disappointed when he was told the axe had fallen because he was certain that his form would improve once he started playing in Australian conditions.

He was under extreme pressure when England lost to India in the second Test at Lord’s last summer but managed to turn things around dramatically to win three Tests on the trot and was convinced he could do the same in one-day cricket. 

Cook, who has never played in a World Cup, leaves the post having led England to more one-day victories than any other captain — 36 from 69 matches — which included taking them to the top of the one-day rankings in 2012 and the Champions Trophy final a year later.

It was the way Cook confounded his one-day doubters after succeeding Andrew Strauss in 2011 that convinced England he was still their man but they agonised over Cook’s future when he lost one-day series to both Sri Lanka and India last summer.

They stood firm then but have lost their nerve now.

Now, as well as Morgan, the beneficiaries of Cook’s misfortune look sure to be Ian Bell, who will compete with Alex Hales to become Moeen Ali’s opening partner, and Yorkshire batsman Gary Ballance, who was left out of the Sri Lankan squad.

England had planned to make an announcement about the captaincy on Friday night but have delayed it until this morning with new skipper Morgan in Sydney. Whitaker, the national selector, will confirm the World Cup squad at Lord’s that will do little to dispel the sporting adage that you become a much better player when you are out of a team rather than in it.

Bell, dropped after two matches in Sri Lanka, Ballance and the fit-again strike bowling pair of Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson will all form part of a 15-man party that will begin as firm underdogs at the biggest one-day tournament of all.

Cook, who has suffered some vicious and personal abuse this year as he struggled to rebuild England from the ashes of their 5-0 defeat by Australia, has been told to recharge his batteries with his wife and daughter at their family farm.

The news may be a blow to Cook, but it should ensure that he is in better condition, both mentally and physically, at the start of a run of 17 Tests in little more than a year which begins when England tour the Caribbean in April.

A refreshed Cook will be integral to England’s hopes of regaining the Ashes next summer which, whatever anyone in English cricket says, remains far more important than competing in a 50-over tournament.

England, who have not been World Cup contenders since 1992, have had to replace their one-day captains immediately after failed World Cup campaigns going back to Mike Atherton in 1996 and continuing with Alec Stewart, Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Strauss.

The only difference this time is that the axing has come before a World Cup failure rather than after one.
