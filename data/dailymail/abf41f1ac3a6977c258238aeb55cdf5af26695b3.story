A 16-year-old boy accused of shooting a classmate at a California high school wrote a story posted online about a bullied student who kills his former tormentors as an adult.

Investigators found the piece written by 16-year-old Bryan Oliver that describes the killing of several people by torture and other morbid means, according to the Bakersfield Californian.

Oliver has been charged as an adult in a shooting at Taft Union High School in January that left two people injured.

He pleaded not guilty to two counts of premeditated attempted murder and three counts of assault with a firearm.

Friends of Oliver said he was teased by his classmates for his red hair and social awkwardness. Students and parents have said that Oliver was suspended briefly last year after he made a hit list, the newspaper said.

The story was posted online last summer and features a character who is tormented by his peers.

Bullies douse the character with a bucket of goat's blood at graduation and years later he kills the student who tipped the bucket, according to the newspaper.

The story goes on to show how the character killed his persecutors in ways that echo their past harassment.

The family of the classmate who was injured in the school shooting has filed a claim against the school district, claiming administrators should have known or knew that Oliver was dangerous.

Oliver's next court hearing is scheduled for May.
