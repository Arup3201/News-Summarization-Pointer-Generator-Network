Smooth-talking: Roy Moyse has been given 28 days to pay victim Karen Culverwell the measly sum of a £1

A serial conman who wiped out a wealthy divorcee of 125,000 pounds which he blew on gambling has been ordered to pay her back just one pound.

Roy Moyse has been given 28 days to pay victim Karen Culverwell the measly sum after a court heard he had no assets to his name which he could give her.

The smooth-talking charlatan had just been released from prison for a string of similarcons on other vulnerable women when he targeted Mrs Culverwell, 50.

He moved in with her in Christchurch, Dorset, after discovering she was divorcing her company director husband and was due for a large settlement.

During their short-term relationship he convinced her to loan him money and give him access to her bank account.

He went on to completely wipe out her divorce settlement and savings which went on paying off his gambling debts.

Moyse, 45, was jailed again for two years in May after pleading guilty to six counts of fraud.

He reappeared at Bournemouth Crown Court for a confiscation hearing to determine how much money he should repay Mrs Culverwell.

A judge ordered him to pay her the token sum of £1 as that is all he could afford right now.

The judge, Recorder James Waddington, told him: 'I’m satisfied there should be a confiscation order in this case of one pound, there being no other assets in your case.

'I will give you 28 days to make good on that.'

Moyse was told that if he ever comes into money or assets in the future he must pay Mrs Culverwell as much as he can at that time, even if he is ever declared bankrupt.

After the hearing, Roger Doerr, financial investigator at the Dorset Police fraud unit, said: 'He has no assets so we can’t restrain any money.

'But £1 is something anyone can afford and this will set him on the road to paying off the full amount.

'We have gone through a Proceeds of Crime Act order and he will have to pay the pound back within the time frame or he will get another week in prison.

'If he comes into money, by winning the lottery for example, we can revisit him for the £125,000. If he doesn’t pay it, he will go back to prison.

'The order will be in place for life or until it is paid off. We can chase him to his grave.

'If the order was not granted then we couldn’t chase him. It is a means that we can keep control of his finances.'

Moyse met mother-of-two Mrs Culverwell in August 2010 after she split up with her long-time husband Robert and the pair began dating.

Between September 2010 and March 2011, she made numerous small loans to him which he failed to pay back.

In September 2011, Mrs Culverwell received her divorce settlement and was persuaded by Moyse to place the money in an internet account and give him access.

He then made numerous unauthorised transfers from the account to his own.

Mrs Culverwell only realised his deceit two years into their relationship when she tried to take out a mortgage on a new house and was told there was nothing left in her account.

She declined to make any comment on the case.

Moyse began his cons on women by hanging around the millionaire’s playground of Sandbanks to pick out potential victims, usually in wine bars.

He either used to claim he was a barrister or a businessman who was waiting for a big business deal to go through.

He was jailed in 2008 for three years for conning four women out of 50,000 pounds but was released after serving just over 12 months in prison.
