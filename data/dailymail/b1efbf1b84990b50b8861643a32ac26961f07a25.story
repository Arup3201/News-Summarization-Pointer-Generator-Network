A devastated model today told how she has been left scarred for life after a yob apparently rammed her head through a window pane.

Lasha Horton, 23, was almost blinded in the brutal attack at her home which left her needing 30 stitches in her face.

Miss Horton spent two days in hospital while plastic surgeons desperately tried to repair a jagged scar running from her left ear to the corner of her eye.

Scarred for life: Lasha Horton, 23, has been left with a scar stretching from her left ear to her left eye

Miss Horton fears she has now lost her £15,000-a-year modelling career after the attack on October 26  .

She said: 'If the glass had hit me elsewhere in my face I could have lost my sight.

'As it is I have arranged to see plastic surgeons and they have told me that because I am mixed race it will be difficult for the scar to be erased completely so I am scarred for life.

'It’s really upsetting because I’ve done a lot of charity work as a model and now I can no longer do that. I also had shoots lined up which I can’t fulfill.

Wounds: Miss Horton also received numerous injuries on other parts of her face and her body

Ruined career: Lasha Horton had secured a contract with modelling agency Demus Castings before the attack

Lost work: Miss Horton was due to star in music videos with 'up-and-coming' artists

'Although I can no longer model I would like to continue my charity work and I thought I could try to turn this into something.

'This happened in a matter of seconds but it’s devastated my life.

'I haven’t been leaving the house and I can no longer pursue the career I wanted.'

Miss Horton, from Nottingham, had lined up a contract with prestigious London modelling agency Demus Castings weeks before the assault.

Nicholas Demus, who runs the agency, said: 'She was due to appear in music videos with some up-and-coming artists.

Optimistic: Miss Horton hopes to use her experience to help with her charity work

Devastating: Miss Horton said the assault only lasted seconds but will stay with her forever

Close call: If the cut had been much closer to her eye, Miss Horton may have lost her sight

'I did have some magazines that wanted to shoot her over 2013, including Flavour fashion magazine, but we’ve had to start re-booking after we got the news.

'At the moment it is going to prove to be a bit difficult with her current situation because obviously normally facial appearance as well as physical appearance is very important.'

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police confirmed they had been called to the incident at about 1.50am on Friday, October 26.

A woman has been charged with causing actual bodily harm with intent.
