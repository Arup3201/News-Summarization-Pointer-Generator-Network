A 79-year-old man has been given five years probation for filming a teenage German male exchange student with a secret camera hidden in a clock.

Lloyd Lindquist of Leesburg, Florida, pleaded guilty to video voyeurism on Friday as part of a plea deal which also prohibits him from having unsupervised contact with minors. 

The host was arrested last after the youngster, who was attending Tavares High School, told police he found a device hidden in his bathroom clock.

On closer inspection, he then discovered a USB port and memory card attached to the device.

The student had been living with Lindquist since August 2013, but didn't find the camera until May 2014. 

The boy searched for the hidden gadget after noticing Lindquist had searched for 'spy cameras' on his browsing history. 

Scott Herman, an attorney for Linduist, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'In the end, it was a difficult decision for Lloyd to enter a plea.

'In my opinion, the evidence against him was not nearly as lewd as the initial report made it out to be.'

The teenager's mother has also started a civil suit against Lindquist, and is seeking $15,000 in damages. It states the boy had an 'expectation of privacy' and was left severely emotionally distressed as a result.
