Corrie McGuire was targeted because of her accent as anti-capitalist protestors brought chaos to the streets of central London last night

A London woman has told how she was attacked by an anti-capitalist protestor 'because of her accent'.

Comedy agent Corrie McGuire was forced to walk through central London when violent demonstrations by activists closed down Parliament Square and Whitehall.

Many of the protestors wore the mask of Guy Fawkes, made popular by the film V for Vendetta and taken up by radical groups.

But as Ms McGuire tried to cross Westminster Bridge, she was targeted by a masked man who picked her out because of the way she spoke.

Ms McGuire, 31, wrote on Twitter: 'For the first time in 10 yrs of living in London I was assaulted, apparently in the name of "anti capitalism".

'Just some pushing and shoving. Heavy police presence so one stepped in v quickly. Just a bit scary when they're in masks.

'I'm sure they're not representative but it was appalling to see. Apparently my accent isn’t in line with current campaign.

'Police incredible but faced with hundreds of masked people being v violent. Not the London I know.'

She later told the Evening Standard: 'The person turned to me saying "it’s alright for you, not all of us have mummies and daddies to look after us," and then he lunged at me.

'I can only assume it was because of my accent that he targeted me. What was terrifying is they were all wearing masks.'

There were scenes of chaos in the capital last night as demonstrators attacked police lines during so-called Bonfire Night protests.

Officers were forced to draw their batons as missiles, plastic cones and road signs were launched along the Mall, while fireworks were left off in Trafalgar Square.

The masked demonstrators - some as young as 14 - also kicked and dragged over security railings while chanting 'one solution, revolution', as others daubed graffiti on riot vans.

During the march, protesters also let off fireworks and threw firecrackers at police who were guarding the Victoria Memorial, hurling abuse at them.

The crowd surged through central London, pushing over bins, shouting at bemused shoppers and commuters and hitting cars and people with yellow flexible tubes.

At one point, they surrounded a man driving a new Mercedes car and sprayed the back of it with an aerosol, pushing their tubes at him as he opened windows to remonstrate with them.

The protest, known as the Million Mask March, was one of hundreds organised at the same time in cities around the world.

Demonstrators wearing sinister Guy Fawkes masks - made famous in the film V for Vendetta - descended on Trafalgar Square, waving banners and placards, before marching towards Parliament Square at 6.30pm.

The protest, organised in hundreds of cities around the world, saw the activists wear masks depicting the sinister face of Guy Fawkes - a mask made famous in the film V for Vendetta

As they milled around the square, they chanted anti-establishment slogans before climbing on to the base of Nelson's Column and letting off fireworks.  

They then moved onto Buckingham Palace before hundreds of protesters made their way through central London, going to Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street and Oxford Circus.

They then marched to the BBC's headquarters at Broadcasting House on nearby Portland Place and going along Oxford Street to Hyde Park and Park Lane. 

As of around midnight, ten people had been arrested, including three on suspicion of assaulting police officers, one of a firework offence, three for public order crimes and one of attempted GBH.

The group said in its manifesto that it fights against mass surveillance, austerity and infringement of human rights.

Protesters argued with riot police as they formed human barriers against the huge crowd of demonstrators

Russell Brand also joined the London arm of the worldwide Million Mask March last year. 

During that march, energy bills were burned, fireworks were shot at Buckingham Palace and there were 15 arrests, following scuffles with police. 

He later wrote an article saying that riots are sparked 'when dialogue fails, when they feel unrepresented and bored by the illusion'. 

Today, it seemed the group were hoping for a similar result. On its website before the march, one of the group members wrote: 'What I'd like to see is a MASSIVE Anonymous blockade of London City.

'Complete physical GRIDLOCK. Only thing that gets through are Fire & Rescue and ambulances. NOTHING ELSE MOVES.'   

Fireworks and smoke were seen rising out of Trafalgar Square as the protest got underway last night

The group - which uses the Guy Fawkes masks as its trademark - said it fights against mass surveillance, austerity and infringement of human rights

The protest was held on the night of Britain's Guy Fawkes Night, and many of the marchers wore the white masks of the man who plotted to blow up parliament in 1605

Protesters chanted anti-establishment slogans as they milled around, while others climbed on to the base of Nelson's Column let off fireworks

The group also warned it would have 'bigger banners, louder voices, more people and a louder system'. 

The London march is part of a day of global demonstrations, which include rallies across Europe, the Americas and Asia. 

The protest has led to officers from the Metropolitan Police, British Transport Police and the City of London Police Force being on stand-by.

The heightened security measures came as the Metropolitan Police attempted to contact Anonymous, but no one came forward with any details. 

In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said they had attempted to contact organisers of the event 'without success'.

Most people protested peacefully, but some ten arrests were made, Metropolitan Police said 

The group warned it would have 'bigger banners, louder voices, more people and a louder system' than last year's protest

Writing on its website before the march, the group said: 'What I'd like to see is a MASSIVE Anonymous blockade of London City'. Protesters waved banners and placards during the march 

The protesters came up with a number of creative ways to express their messages of discontent 

The group said in its manifesto that it fights again mass surveillance, austerity and infringement of human rights

Anti-capitalist protesters held up signs saying 'Expect Us' 'We Are Anonymous' and 'We Are Everyone'

Rather than communicate directly with local authorities, Anonymous sent a message to the government

The protesters made their way through central London, going to Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street and Oxford Circus

And it added that they have imposed Section 60AA of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 across Westminster between 5pm today and 2am tomorrow, which provides powers to remove masks when police fear a crime will be committed.

Scotland Yard said: 'The Met Police deals with around 4,500 protests and events every year. These can range from a single protester to hundreds of thousands of people walking through the capital's streets.

'Officers work with organisers to ensure that people are able to carry out their right to peaceful protest whilst ensuring Londoners can go about their daily business.' 

Last year’s London march saw more than 2,500 protesters take to the streets, in a rally which saw fireworks thrown at Buckingham Palace and a total of 15 arrests.  

Rather than communicate directly with local authorities, Anonymous sent a message to the government, and to global world leaders: 'To oppressive governments, we say this: we do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail against the angry masses of the body politic.'
