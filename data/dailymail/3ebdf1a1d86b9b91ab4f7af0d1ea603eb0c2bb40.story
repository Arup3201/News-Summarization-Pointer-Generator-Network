Women hit hardest by controversial changes to the state pension age will be given a lifeline, ministers confirmed last night.

Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told MPs that ‘transitional arrangements’ will be made to help those most affected.

His apparent concession comes after the Daily Mail repeatedly highlighted how women in their late 50s would be affected more than any other group by cost-saving increases in the pension age.

Concessions... but Iain Duncan Smith failed to say exactly what will be done to help or how many women will benefit

Only yesterday it emerged that senior Lib Dem ministers told the Treasury that some kind of compromise was ‘inevitable’ to soften the blow.

Mr Duncan Smith repeatedly signalled that concessions will be made. He also said he would ‘happily look at transitional arrangements.’

But he failed to say exactly what will be done to help or how many women will benefit. At present, a woman can start receiving her state pension at the age of 60 years and seven months. A man must wait until he is 65.

Under the changes, the age will reach 65 for both men and women in November 2018 – and will rise to 66 by April 2020.

MP yesterday waved through the change when the Pensions Bill received its second reading after the Government offered to hold talks with critics about how the change would be introduced.

It was given a second reading by 302 votes to 232, Government majority 70.

Women are the biggest losers from the changes, with around 2.6million having to wait longer before their pension begins to be paid.

But Mr Duncan Smith insisted that it would affect only a 'relatively small number of women' and that delay would cost the taxpayer £10 billion.

He offered to hold 'discussions' with MPs over the 'transitional arrangements', but maintained: 'We stand by the need for men and women's state pension ages to equalise in 2018.

'And both will rise together so the state pension age reaches 66 in 2020. This Bill will go forward on that basis.

'If we delayed the move to 66 until 2022 it would cost the taxpayer £10 billion - an unfair financial burden borne disproportionately by the next generation.'

Of the total, around 500,000 will have to wait more than a year and 33,000 will have to wait exactly two years. There is broad agreement on the need to equalise and raise state pension ages, which were first set in 1926.

But MPs on all sides say it is unfair that one particular group of women will be hit so hard, losing as much as £15,000 each.

Dame Anne Begg, Labour chairman of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, even warned that the proposals risked creating a ‘new poor’ of women forced on to benefits until they reach the new state pension age.

Former Conservative justice spokesman Eleanor Laing urged the Government to think again.

‘No one can object to the equalisation of pension ages when we’re fighting so hard on other areas of equality,’ she told Mr Duncan Smith. ‘You are absolutely right to do what you’re doing.

‘But will you recognise that there is a particular group of women – some 300,000 of them – born in 1954 for whom the transition arrangements are rather more difficult than they are for any other group of society? Will you look at other ways of helping that particular group of women?’

Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Jenny Willott said the legislation currently did not ‘pass the fairness test’. But she insisted it was worth backing and that changes could be made to improve it.

Former Labour welfare minister Frank Field said the Coalition was right to seek to make savings.

He suggested pension age increases for both men and women after 2020 could be accelerated slightly to pay for easing the burden on women in their late 50s now.

 

As reported in yesterday's Mail

This idea was also raised by Government sources last night. It could cause resentment, but most pension experts agree ten years’ notice of relatively minor changes would be sufficient.

In his response, Mr Duncan Smith said he would ‘happily look at transitional arrangements’. It is not clear, however, whether these will apply to the 33,000 biggest losers, or the larger number of 500,000 women.

Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, said: ‘The ideal solution would be to revise the timetable. Tinkering is better than nothing but we need to see the detail.’

Campaigners yesterday warned the Government could face a legal battle if changes were not made.

Experts raised the threat of a judicial review because it is ‘unreasonable’ to force through such high-speed changes to women’s state pension age.

Labour’s pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves accused the Government of ‘clearly breaching’ its coalition agreement. That document said the state pension age would not be increased ‘sooner than 2020 for women’. In fact, it is starting to rise in 2018.

But Tory Richard Drax accused Labour of failing to deal with the pensions’ crisis when in power.

He said: ‘It has long been apparent that something had to give. Our national longevity has increased by an average of ten years since the 1970s.’

QUENTIN LETTS: YESTERDAY IN PARLIAMENT

For decades we have been told that women must be treated equally. Many a bra was burned to a frilly crisp.

Germaine Greer cabbaged away about little else for the best part of 40 (or was it 50?) years.

Chaps had their ears boxed for gawping at Miss World and domestic rolling pins were wielded like Johannesburg sjamboks. Mrs Letts even took up DIY.

Now, hooray, we ardent feminists have something long overdue to celebrate. The state pension age for men and women is to be made equal. Female pensioners will no longer be given preferential terms.

Hard stare: Yvette Cooper didn't much like Iain Duncan Smith's plans for pension reform

Equality for all! Strike up the Internationale!

But what happens? Politicians are in uproar, talking about how 'unfair' it all is. You can't win.

Iain Duncan Smith, Pensions Secretary, played things sotto when he came to the Commons yesterday afternoon.

He opened the Chamber's doors to find row upon row of crosspatches sitting there, steaming like a kitchen of Chinese saucepans.

Arms were crossed. Fingers were being drummed. Uh-oh. The House had a mood on. Mr Duncan Smith has never been one of life's shouters – it makes him cough – so he did not try to pick a fight.

He did try one or two tiny jokes but soon dropped that tactic. Wise. As many an errant man has been told, 'don't think you can laugh me out of it – it ISN'T funny!'

Mr Duncan Smith faced the likes of Labour MPs Fiona Mactaggart (Slough), Joan Walley (Stoke on Trent N) and frontbenchers Rachel Reeves and Yvette Cooper.

The editorial board at Spare Rib magazine was scarcely more formidable. IDS's reluctance to become openly hostile was understandable. Even Neanderthal man knew when not to risk life and limb.

All but the most novice circus tamers resist baiting a lioness when her tail is twitching.

Shadow Home Secretary Miss Cooper was there simply out of interest, or maybe peevishness, for Pensions is no longer her realm.

She gave Mr Duncan Smith one of those chilling, old-fashioned stares, the like of which no chap can ever fully ignore.

You may know the type of glare. It is like being bored into by a Black and Decker.

Miss Reeves stepped up to the despatch box repeatedly to give it an imperious whack.

Mr Duncan Smith took her interventions. She did not like what he told her, but at least he had given vent to her fury. The Reeves voice is a forceful instrument. Put a bag over your head and she could be twin sister of the late and masterly Bernard Bresslaw.

As a former Opposition leader, Mr Duncan Smith has a certain insurance policy. He is coated by that special varnish Westminster reserves for those who have failed in lofty office.

Lack of success makes them popular. And so Mr Duncan Smith found some of his critics opening their sallies with little preambles about what an admirable fellow he usually was.

Labour's Rachel Reeves, left, and Fiona Mactaggart were among the MPs that Mr Duncan Smith had to face

Thanks to his tact, the House did not ignite. Indeed, when his shadow, Liam Byrne, later spoke from the despatch box, there may have been increased warmth towards the Secretary of State.

Mr Byrne was dismally partisan and seemed barely to grasp the necessity of pensions change.

As IDS explained, longevity has made a nonsense of the sums.

When the state pension system started, it was on a ratio of nine people working to every pensioner. This is now three to one, and will soon be two to one.

It's actually pretty amazing that no government has seized the issue beforehand.

Mr Duncan Smith said that 'responsible government is not always easy government' and claimed that 'we will stay the course'. Yet he also said that he did 'not rule out a discussion' about how to help women born in 1954, who may be unlucky in the way the adjustments are made.

That sounds as though a cop-out is being prepared.

Can't we just send them some flowers instead and promise to take them to the pictures?
