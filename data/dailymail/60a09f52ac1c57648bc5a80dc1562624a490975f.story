Longtime MSNBC news commentator Keith Olbermann once apologized to President Bill Clinton – in writing – for aggressively driving the network's coverage of the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal during 1996 and 1997.

An internal White House email about his Damascene confession was included in a trove of nearly 10,000 documents released Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library. It was the seventh such Friday afternoon document dump of previously secret papers from Clinton's eight White House years.

'Keith Olbermann has written to POTUS,' wrote West Wing senior editor Scott Michaud to press aide Lori Anderson, 'apologizing for "whatever part I may have played in perpetuating this ceaseless coverage (of the Lewinsky story) .... I'll be heading back to my previous career in sports as quickly as possible ...".'

Keith Olbermann's written apology to President Bill Clinton was among nearly 10,000 pages released by the Clinton Presidential Library on October 10

Olbermann interviewed then-first lady Hillary Clinton on his MSNBC show in 1997, at the same time he was flogging the Lewinsky sex scandal – a habit for which he would later apologize

The internal West Wing email described the written apology and suggested a modified form letter in reply

Olbermann did indeed return to sportscasting until 2003 when he returned to MSNBC – this time as a confirmed liberal – for eight more years, becoming a thorn in the side of President George W. Bush.

Anderson, then an assistant to White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry, forwarded the message to press aide Mark Neschis and communications staffer Jennifer Palmieri

She suggested in her forwarding email that the Executive Office of the President should send Olbermann a modified form letter in reply.

'Please take a look at the following draft letter to Keith Olberman [sic],' she wrote. 'I think we may want to make it a bit warmer.'

The draft letter that presented for Clinton's signature read: 'Dear Keith, Thanks so much for your kind message. I've been touched by the many expressions of encouragement and support I have received from friends across the country. I'm grateful you got in touch with me, and I send you my very best wishes.'

Palmieri, one of the staffers she consulted, is now President Barack Obama's White House communications director.

Olbermann was then host of 'The Big Show with Keith Olbermann' and 'White House in Crisis' on MSNBC. 

He came to resent his management's pressure to drive ratings with constant coverage of the Lewinsky scandal, which involved a young intern who engaged in a sexual relationship with the president, according to E! Online.

Clinton carried on a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, then a 23-year-old White House intern, and later lied about it under oath

In the years before Olbermann emerged as a consistent liberal, Olbermann bashed the Clinton spin machine nightly, bringing rare high ratings to MSNBC

At the time, E! reported that he wanted out of his three-year contract early, and took to calling his political program 'The White House Isn't in Crisis but We'll Keep Calling It That Because There's a Graphic.' 

In June 1998, in a speech at Cornell University, he told students that he was 'having the dry heaves in the bathroom because my moral sensor is going off but I can't even hear it, I'm so seduced by these ratings.'

About the time he wrote to the White House, Olbermann – a legendary American sports historian who owns a reported 35,000 baseball cards – wriggled out of his MSNBC contract and joined Fox Sports Net.

Five years later, he was back at MSNBC. That eight-year run ended in 2011 when the network suspended, and later fired, him for donating money congressional Democrats who had been guests on his show.

Spokespersons at ESPN2, where Olbermann's sports show currently aired, did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.
