Lee Stephens swore at, punched and spat at police and paramedics after crashing his car while drunk

A vicar crashed his car while three times over the drink-drive limit - then attacked police officers and paramedics.

Lee Stephens also told them he was a member of the IRA and threatened to murder them.

The 31-year-old collided head on with a family's Ford C-Max car in Billericay, Essex, leaving a father and his two young children, aged five and six, in hospital.

Stephens then punched a paramedic, spat at a police officer and assaulted a female paramedic as she treated him.

The chaos continued at Basildon Hospital where Stephens told police he had contacts in the IRA and they would 'blow them up'.

He then shouted at a police officer, accusing him of having sex with his sister. It was revealed in court the officer's sister had died just weeks earlier.

Stephens, of  Armagh, Northern Ireland, was working at Elim Pentecostal Church in Ingatestone at the time.

He was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months when he appeared at Basildon Magistrates' Court on Friday. The drama started after Stephens was thrown out The Forge Pub in The Pantiles, Billericay.

He crashed his car in to a lamp post before smashing  into the family's car.

The court heard he was arrested by an off-duty police officer and a breath test showed he had 108 microgrammes of alcohol in his breath per 100ml. The legal limit is 35 microgrammes.

When ambulance crews arrived to treat Stephens and the injured family he became aggressive and swore at them, before punching Sgt Mark Ammon twice in the leg.

He then spat at another officer and punched paramedic Gary Harvey in the kidneys.

Stephens said: 'I am a pastor, let me go or you will lose your jobs. I will kill everyone, I know the IRA.'

Sam Doyle, prosecuting, told the court the children involved in the crash suffered whiplash and are now too scared to get in a car because they think they will die.

Stephens admitted assault, assaulting a police officer, common assault, failing to provide a specimen of blood and using threatening words and behaviour.

He was ordered to pay his victims a total of £250 compensation The court heard that Stephens was on antidepressants following stress at work and did not usually drink.

He told the court he did not remember any of the incident and was deeply ashamed.

Chair of the bench, Balbira Bal, said: 'Emergency service staff try to help the public and should be given respect and consideration.' 

Threat: He also told police officers at Basildon Hospital he would 'blow them up'. Stephens was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months when he appeared at Basildon Magistrates' Court (pictured)

The Elim Pentecostal Church today confirmed Stephens had been sacked after they were told of his actions.

However, it emerged the shamed minister had not confessed to his sins and senior church ministers only became aware of what had happened after media enquiries.

A spokesman said: 'The Elim Church was saddened to hear of the events surrounding the prosecution of Lee Stephens.

'Naturally the Church cannot accept such behaviour and Lee Stephens is no longer a minister with Elim.

'We understand that this was out of character and he is totally contrite and apologises for his behaviour.

'Our sympathies go to the family involved in the accident and to the officer and paramedic concerned.'
