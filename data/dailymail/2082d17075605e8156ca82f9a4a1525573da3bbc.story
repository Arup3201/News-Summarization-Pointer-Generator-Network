Kyle Busch will miss Sunday's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season-opening Daytona 500 after breaking his leg during a support event accident.

The 29-year-old is the younger brother of 2004 champion Kurt, who has lost his final appeal against his indefinite suspension after a judge said the former champion almost surely choked and beat his former girlfriend - who has previously referred to as an assassin. 

It means both drivers will miss the 57th edition of 'The Great American Race'. 

Kyle's Toyota slammed into an inside retaining wall at high speed late in Saturday's race and he was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Case: NASCAR driver Kurt Busch leaves the IMC building after an appeal hearing on Saturday. He lost and has been suspended from the circuit indefinitely 

Ruled out: Kyle Busch's Toyota slammed into an inside retaining wall at high speed on the Daytona track late in Saturday's pre-event race and he was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment

He sustained a right lower leg compound fracture and left mid-foot fracture in the crash with eight laps remaining. His team Joe Gibbs Racing said he was undergoing surgery on his right leg. 

On Saturday, Kurt lost his last-ditch appeal, ending his already-slim hopes of racing  in the season-opener.

On Friday Family Court Commissioner David Jones concluded that Busch lilkeyabused Patricia Driscoll by 'manually strangling' her and smashing her head into a wall inside his motorhome at Dover International Speedway last September.

He however has claimed she is an 'assassin' and a bad-ass, and once came home covered in blood. 

'Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made,' NASCAR said in a statement.

Busch attorney Rusty Hardin said the driver will appeal, and NASCAR said it will be expedited. Still, SHR said Regan Smith will drive Busch's car in the Daytona 500 regardless of the appeal outcome. 

'We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold,' Hardin said in a statement.

'It is important for everyone to remember that the Commissioner's report has to do with a civil, family law matter and no criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Busch.'

Busch becomes the first driver suspended by NASCAR for domestic violence.

Chairman Brian France had maintained the series would let the process play out before ruling on Busch's eligibility - and the series came down hard in finding that he committed actions detrimental to stock car racing and broke the series' behavioral rules.

Travis Kvapil, who qualified second for Friday night's Truck Series race, was arrested and charged with assault of his wife in 2013. NASCAR took no action against Kvapil.

Chevrolet immediately suspended its relationship with Busch. A short time later, on the glass outside of Busch's garage stall at Daytona, someone had scrawled in black marker '#41 Ray Rice,' a reference to the former Baltimore Ravens running back whose own case of domestic violence dominated much of last year. Busch drives the No. 41 Chevrolet. 

Procedures: Kyle (pictured just before the crash) sustained a right lower leg compound fracture and left mid-foot fracture in the crash with eight laps remaining. It means both of the brothers are out of the blockbuster season-opener

The 36-year-old Busch has denied the alleged assault, which is the subject of a separate criminal investigation, but the judge said Driscoll's version of the incident was more credible than Busch's.

Driscoll said she was never motivated to have Busch punished by NASCAR.

'I reported a crime, just like anybody else who has been abused should do, because no one is above the law,' Driscoll said.

'I'm very encouraged that NASCAR is taking steps to recognize that domestic violence is a serious issue, and I hope that we see them develop a very clear policy on it.'

She urged NASCAR to develop a confidential reporting mechanism that partners of drivers could use to report domestic abuse without fear of threats or reprisals for coming forward.

'NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership and the broader industry that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated in the industry,' NASCAR executive vice president Steve O'Donnell said.

'I want to make it clear that any inference that there's a culture or a tolerance for this type of behavior is patently false.'
