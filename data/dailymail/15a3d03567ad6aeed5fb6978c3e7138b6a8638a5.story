A legal watchdog has agreed to investigate a complaint against two barristers from the Leveson inquiry who have had an affair.

The decision by the Bar Standards Board comes nearly three months after a lawyer to the inquiry into media standards, Carine Patry Hoskins, was revealed to have embarked on a relationship with a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the Press.

Conservative MP Rob Wilson has led calls for an inquiry into whether the relationship between the mother-of-two, who is now divorced, and David Sherborne, a barrister representing advocates of statutory Press regulation, could have compromised its findings.

A professional code of conduct suggests affairs between opposing lawyers should be avoided lest the perception be created of ‘a danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’.

According to a well-placed source, the Bar Standards Board has started to investigate the complaint from Mr Wilson into potential breaches of its code of conduct, though no public announcement has been made.

Mr Sherborne, who represented Hugh Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking, went on holiday to the Greek island of Santorini with Miss Patry Hoskins in August last year.

The visit took place while the inquiry was being conducted, although the couple claim they simply discussed the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’. They say they changed their minds later but claim their affair did not begin until after the controversial Leveson report was published in November.

Firm: Lord Justice Leveson has flatly rejected any suggestion that his report into Press standards may have been tainted by the relationship

Lord Justice Leveson has flatly rejected any suggestion that his report into Press standards may have been tainted by the relationship – and insisted that ‘every finding of fact, every conclusion and every recommendation’ in the report was his alone.

The judge is expected to face further questions on the issue after agreeing to appear before MPs on the Commons culture, media and sport committee.

Critics of the inquiry who have raised questions about the relationship are now expected to submit information to the board.

It will normally carry out an initial assessment before deciding whether to undertake a formal investigation which could lead to a disciplinary tribunal. The body can impose punishments ranging from words of advice, fines or suspension to ultimately having a barrister struck off.

A spokesman for the board said: ‘Our rules make it clear that we cannot comment on individual cases unless a formal disciplinary tribunal has been scheduled.’

Mr Wilson declined to comment.

Miss Patry Hoskins became known as ‘woman on the left’ and received thousands of mentions on Twitter for her close attention to actor Hugh Grant’s evidence during the 97-day inquiry.

Her fees amounted to £218,606 between July 2011 and November 2012 for her work on the team appointed by Lord Justice Leveson.

In the Commons yesterday, Nick Clegg said the Privy Council should be given time to give ‘objective’ consideration to the newspaper and magazine industry’s alternative to the cross-party Royal Charter on Press regulation produced in response to the Leveson report.

The council, an advisory body to the Queen, will meet today to consider the industry’s charter. More than 200 publishers are expected to sign up to a new regulator, called the Independent Press Standards Organisation, which will have the power to impose fines of up to £1million and require editors to publish upfront apologies.

Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes asked Mr Clegg: ‘In the interests of the victims of Press intrusion and many others, can you confirm that the charter agreed by this House and all parties for Press regulation will be put to the Privy Council at the earliest possible opportunity for agreement?’

The Deputy Prime Minister, who is Lord President of the Privy Council and is likely to chair today’s meeting, replied: ‘Of course I can confirm we will do so at the earliest opportunity but first, as you know, we need to respect the processes of the Privy Council and a rival charter has been submitted for consideration.

‘We need to make sure that is properly examined in a way that is objective and is not subject to undue interference.’
