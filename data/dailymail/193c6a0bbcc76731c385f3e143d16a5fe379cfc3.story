Nearly half of pilots say they have fallen asleep at the controls, it emerged yesterday.

The alarming admission came as union leaders warned MPs that even more passengers’ lives will be put at risk due to new European rules that could allow pilots to land their aircraft after 22 hours without sleep.

The change – to ‘harmonise’ flying hours – poses ‘a danger to public safety’ and must not be adopted by the UK, the British Airline Pilots’ Association warned the House of Commons Transport Committee yesterday.

The pilots' association, Balpa, fears air passengers will be put at risk if changes to their working arrangements are agreed

Its research claims that the 
proposals will leave pilots ‘drunk with fatigue’ – as if they had 
consumed five cans of lager and were four times over the legal limit for
flying.

Balpa’s head of safety, Dr Rob Hunter,
told MPs that its own poll showed 43 per cent of pilots had fallen 
asleep on the flight deck – but said this was ‘probably an 
underestimation’.

Asked if the EU changes would lead to more accidents, Dr Hunter replied: ‘I would say so.’

He added that competition among airlines was so intense it could lead to skimping on safety.

‘If airlines spend on safety today, they might go out of business tomorrow,’ he said.

Balpa has said there are no guarantees that mandated rest time for pilots will mean they will get sleep

The pilots’ union is concerned that 
the Civil Aviation Authority appears to be supporting the flying time 
rules from the EU’s European Aviation Safety Agency when it should be 
demanding an opt-out.

Before the meeting, Balpa general 
secretary Jim McAuslan said: ‘The Government have to answer this 
question: “Is it safe to land an aircraft after 22 hours [without 
sleep]?” If not, they need to reject these EU proposals now and keep the
current UK rules in place until they have been significantly improved.’

Fatigue was seen as factor in the crash which killed 49 people in Buffalo, upstate New York, in the U.S. three years ago.

It emerged the co-pilot was paid a salary so low that she lived with her parents near Seattle and commuted across the country to her job, a combination of long travel and little money that a safety official called a "recipe for an accident".

A National Transportation Safety Board hearing then focused on whether Captain Marvin Renslow and co-pilot Rebecca Shaw were fatigued on the wintry night of February 12, 2009, when they apparently made a series of critical errors as Continental Connection Flight 3407 approached Buffalo Niagara International Airport.

The Bombardier Dash 8-Q400, a twin-engine turboprop, experienced an aerodynamic stall, rolling back and forth before plunging into a house below.

All 49 people aboard and one on the ground were killed in the worst U.S. air crash in seven years.

Mr McAuslan added: ‘Twenty hours of wakefulness is far from the only part of the proposals which give us serious concern.

‘Compared with the UK’s domestic 
rules, the EU proposals would see pilots being able to fly further – as 
far as California – with no back-up crew and, contrary to scientific 
advice, allow pilots to do up to seven early starts in a row, which is 
desperately fatiguing.

‘We need the Government to say it 
won’t support this danger to public safety, and will demand that we 
either get the proposals to a much safer position, or retain our own 
domestic rules.’

Kris Major, of the Unite union, said the proposals would lead to a 17 per cent increase in pilots’ workloads.

And there is a five-and-a-half times 
higher chance of an accident when duty periods exceed 13 hours, 
according to Jon Horne, executive board director of the European Cockpit
Association.

But the Civil Aviation Authority rejected any suggestion that the controversial EU rules would compromise safety.

Captain Tim Price, of British Airways,
insisted airlines were not  prioritising profits and that safety was 
the responsibility of the airline and the captain flying on that 
particular day.

Aviation minister Theresa Villiers claimed there would be ‘significant safety gains’ from the European proposals.

 She  said the EU plans would 
‘broadly’ bring the whole of the continent up to UK levels and would not
see a ‘levelling down’ of standards.
