This time last year Burberry called on industry heavyweights Cara Delevingne and Edie Campbell - as well as A-lister offspring Romeo Beckham - to star in its spring/summer campaign.

But this time around, the luxury British brand is championing a bunch of fresh faced Brits and while you may not recognise a lot of them, remember this is where it all began for model-of-the-moment Cara just a few short years ago.

The young British cast continues Burberry's support of emerging talent and features the likes of actor Jamie Campbell Bower, musician Leo Dobson and model Malaika Firth.

Firth hit headlines as the face of Prada this season - the first black model to front a campaign for the Italian fashion house since Naomi Campbell in 1994.

There is also young model Matilda Lowther, Coventry-born face Neelam Johal, Callum Ball and newcomer Jean Campbell.  

Under the creative direction of Christopher Bailey, the campaign, which was shot by fashion favourite Mario Testino, reflects the gentle and romantic feel of the Burberry Spring/Summer 2014 collection.

'There's a distinctly English mood to 
this season – a gentle, effortless, romantic quality, brought to life by
 a cast of bright young British talent,' said Christopher Bailey, Burberry 
Chief Creative Officer.

Featuring relaxed silhouettes in soft pastels and light fabrics, the campaign will launch globally in January 2014.

Fashion fans will be able to snap up classic unstructured trench coats, wrap coats in pastel hues, relaxed knits, sheer English lace dresses and Scottish-woven cashmere pullovers.

Accessories include the brand new Petal bag for women and Duffle Bag for men, as well as the petal-shaped and Wave sunglasses seen on the Spring/Summer 2014 runway.

In true Burberry tech-savvy style, the campaign will be unlocked across global platforms including outdoor and print advertising, Burberry.com, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Pinterest, Sina Weibo, Douban, Kaixin001 and Youku.

The Burberry Beauty Box has opened its doors in Covent Garden and will combine Burberry make-up, fragrance and accessories in new, playful and exciting ways, promises Christopher Bailey.

The Burberry Beauty Box features the full Burberry Beauty collection of make-up and fragrance, as well as limited edition beauty products. The space also houses Burberry accessories including sunglasses, scarves and an exclusive selection of bags.

Continuing Burberry’s love of all things digital, the space features a custom built digital screen in the shape of the iconic Burberry check, showcasing bespoke content on the exterior façade.

There will also be 16ft ‘digital chandelier’ showcasing monthly beauty content over multiple screens and the brand's first till-free retail environment.

By placing a Burberry nail polish onto an RFID-enabled platform, customers can choose their skin-tone and virtually experience the selected nail shade. You can then have a shape and colour with your chosen polish at the Runway Nail Service bar.
