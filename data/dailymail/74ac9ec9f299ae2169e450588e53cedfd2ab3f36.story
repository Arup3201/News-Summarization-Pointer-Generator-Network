Police believe they have found the bodies of a pregnant celebrity chef and her husband three days after a man was charged with their murder.

Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, a season eight finalist on the Food Network Star, and Joseph Codd, 45, were killed in their Leicester, North Carolina, home last Thursday, police have said.

The remains were discovered in Buncombe County on Thursday, but officials say they have not been positively identified.

Robert Jason Owens, 36, a construction worker who they had hired to work on their home, was booked on two counts of first-degree murder, the murder of an unborn child, larceny and breaking and entering on Tuesday.

Linked: Robert Jason Owens, 36, who has been charged with murdering a pregnant Food Network star and her husband, was a key suspect in the disappearance of Zebb Quinn (pictured) 15 years ago, it has emerged

Suspect: Sheriff Van Duncan said Owens (pictured) was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of 18-year-old Quinn, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21

Dr. Sharon Sweede told Ashville's Citizen Times: 'I did a brief exam of these remains. We don't have positive identifications. We really can't make any other comment

It has emerged that Owens was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of Zebb Quinn, 18, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21. 

Quinn, who has not been seen since the night of January 2 that year, was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with Owens at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm.

The pair then drove away separately. But they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a Mitsubishi Eclipse for sale that Quinn was interested in buying, police told Fox Carolina.

Owens later told police that a short while later, Quinn flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over. Quinn then went off to return a page, before returning in a 'frantic' state, Owens said.

Cancelling the pair's plans to see the Mitsubishi, Quinn reportedly told Owens he needed to leave and drove off, bumping into his friend's truck on his way. Since that moment, he has been missing.

On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant.

Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, which was situated at The Little Pigs Barbecue near a hospital where Vlahakis worked. A pair of lips were also drawn on the car's back windshield.  

Unanswered questions: Quinn (left), who has not been seen since the night of January 2, 2000, was captured on video buying sodas with Owens (right, in his mug shot in the Codds' murder case) at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. Later that night, the teenager drove off and has not been seen since

Work: Quinn, a Roberson High School graduate, had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. He also enjoyed his work at this Walmart (pictured), his family said at the time

Mother: On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis (pictured), filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, while a pair of lips were drawn on the car's back windshield

It remains unknown who the Labrador-mix puppy - which was around three months old - belonged to. It was later adopted by a police officer, according to The Charley Project cold cases website. 

In February, police were authorized to take hair, blood and saliva samples from Owens in relation to the disappearance of Quinn, whom his family said would not have gone away of his own accord.

Although they never acquired evidence to warrant charges against Owens, Sheriff Van Duncan told The Citizen-Times in Asheville Owens 'was definitely a primary suspect in the Zebb Quinn case'.

Vlahakis later said of her son: 'We all feel very certain that he was killed that night', explaining how he had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished.

Speaking to Fox Carolina, the grief-stricken mother added: 'It is hard because we don't know and it's hard because we can't say goodbye and kind of put everything at rest.'

Movie set: Mrs Codd (pictured in a Food Network photo) ) was due to cater on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production when they vanished. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd - she had just announced her firm would be providing food on the set of The Big Short

Home: In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home (pictured). They were both set to leave for work on Sunday - but never made it

Scene: Authorities (pictured at the scene) believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun'

In 2012, Quinn's disappearance was featured on the Investigation Discovery Channel show,  'Disappeared', which covered various theories relating to the baffling cold case.  

One theory revolved around a woman whom Quinn was apparently romantically interested in. The woman, Misty, reportedly had an abusive boyfriend who had made threats toward the teenager.

However, Misty and her partner were questioned by police at the time and no arrests were made.

Authorities have said said they believe more than one person may have been involved in Quinn’s disappearance and presumed murder.  

In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home. They were both set to leave for work on Sunday.

Mrs Codd was catering on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd, as she had just announced her company, Tree Hugger Catering, would be providing food on the set of The Big Short.

The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell.

However, authorities believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun'.

Family members reported the couple missing on Sunday, according to reports. Police have not disclosed whether they have suspicions on how the couple might have been killed.

Mrs Codd, who grew up in Mississippi,was five months' pregnant with their first child at the time.

The Codds' cars and two dogs were found at their home. James Fisher, a member of a local band that played the Codds' wedding last September, said the pair were a 'beautiful couple'.

Speaking of Mr Codd, the musician told the Citizen-Times of Mr Codd: 'I know he believed in giving people second chances, and he'd hired people out there who'd been in prison.'

It remains unclear what Owens' motive was behind the alleged murder. Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams said he has not yet decided if he will ask for the death penalty in the case.

Owens, who is being held without bail, appeared in court on Tuesday, where he requested an attorney, ABC News 13 reported. His next hearing is scheduled for April 7.
