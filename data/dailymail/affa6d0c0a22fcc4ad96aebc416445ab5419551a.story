Having your bins emptied outside your home doesn’t seem much to expect when paying more than £1,500 a year in council tax.

But for the villagers of Bootle in Cumbria, life isn’t quite that easy.

Their local council wanted the villagers to drag their 240-litre wheelie bins more than a mile and a half up a steep hill for them to be emptied.

Waste of time: Residents of Annaside and Hyton, such as Steven Fell, would have to walk almost two miles with their wheelie bins to leave them for collection before the council's u-turn

The council stopped picking up the bins as a cost-cutting measure, but residents were furious about it

When the residents protested, the 
council’s ‘compromise’ was that they could leave the bin behind and lug 
the refuse sacks up the hill instead.

However, Copeland Borough Council has now backed down.

Farmer
Deryck Fell, of Annaside, said: 'It's great that they're going to do 
that. But I don't know why they wanted to make the changes in the first 
place. They didn't consult us properly.'

The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has decided  to remove the litter bins from residential streets, controversially claiming that they attract more rubbish.

Officials at the council said that bins on the street encourage fly-tipping, increasing the amount of litter left behind.

Local, Amanda Salvesen, 27, a PR manager from Earl’s Court, said: ‘I don’t think they have asked the local residents. They are always full, people use them. They should be adding more, not taking them away.’

Despite objections, the
council claims that when bins are removed from streets, there is only a 
slight increase in littering.

Kathy Way, head of waste at the council, said in a report: ‘There are two schools of thought regarding litter bins; one is that litter bins are needed for the public to use, indeed that some members of the public look for litter bins in which to deposit waste, otherwise they may take it home or drop it on the street.

‘The other is that litter bins attract more rubbish, some of which can be unpaid-for commercial waste and domestic waste.’

As well as the logistical problems of transporting the bins to the collection point, residents had raised concerns that the large volume of bins, heavy traffic flow and narrow roads would have led to an increase in accidents.

Councillor Allan Holliday, portfolio holder for the environment and sustainability, said the council had now organised a ‘mutually acceptable' alternative with the residents.

He said: 'We are facing unprecedented funding cuts, and as a result have reviewed all of the services we provide, including waste collection. As a result, like other rural councils, we are having to look at the feasibility of collections from lanes.

'However in this instance, we've listened and have already arranged a mutually acceptable and practical alternative with residents, as we would look to do wherever concerns are raised. Consultation is ongoing.'

Keith Parker, Copeland Borough Council's head of neighbourhoods, previously told the Evening Mail the council was ‘no longer able to afford to travel significant distances down lanes to collect people's waste'. A Copeland Borough Council spokeswoman confirmed that there  was no way to practically implement the policy in the Bootle situation so, at the moment, the council would be continuing to collect the waste as normal.

The bags would then be collected from a large bin stationed at the end of the lane.

The rules, were due to come into effect on 
February 15, were part of a cost-cutting drive by Copeland Borough 
Council – which had said it was no longer prepared to collect rubbish 
from ‘off-route properties’.

Before the council's u-turn Mr Fell, 56, said it was absolute ‘madness’ to expect elderly residents to embark on a three-mile round trip.

‘There are at least five residents who are in their eighties and they simply won’t be able to do it,’ he said.

‘It is an absolutely ludicrous 
situation and we’re frankly disgusted that the council would allow this 
to happen considering how much we all pay for our council tax.’

Bootle residents Hazel Fell, David Cross and Deryck Fell, above, spoke out against the council's decision to cut the bin service from 14 houses

Mr Fell, who lives with his wife Hazel
in Bootle, added: ‘It doesn’t make environmental sense to have 14 homes
running 14 vehicles up the road to drop their bins off. There is no 
room for bins where they are proposing to have it collected. You’ve got 
loads of cars and school buses going down that road.

‘There have already been accidents – this will make it worse.’

Until now the residents, whose annual
council tax bill is £1,569, put their rubbish in individual 
wheelie bins and a wagon has driven up Church Lane in Bootle once a 
fortnight to collect it.

The authority hoped the scheme would save £120,000.

It will still make assisted 
collections for disabled residents but has said this will be carried out
with smaller vehicles. Councillor Allan Holliday, a spokesman for the 
environment and sustainability, said: ‘We are facing unprecedented 
funding cuts and have reviewed all of the services we provide, including
waste collection.

‘As a result, like other rural 
councils we are having to look at the feasibility of collections from 
lanes. Consultation is ongoing.’
