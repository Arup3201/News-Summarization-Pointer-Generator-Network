When faced with someone as spectacularly good as Rafael Nadal on clay you do not require idiots in the crowd calling out as you try and survive a match point in the fourth set.

That was what Novak Djokovic had to contend with and, just as had happened in losing the 2012 final, he ended with a double fault that completed a 3-6 7-5 6-2 6-4 defeat to the man cementing his place as the all time great dirtballer.

It did not take long for the Serb’s fury to turn to tears as the Roland Garros crowd chanted his name when he went to collect the runner’s up trophy, a duty that the 28 year-old Spaniard has never had to perform.

The calling out was not why Djokovic lost – that was down to an opponent who currently exercises an unparallelled dominance over one major international sports event.

Champion: Rafael Nadal bites the trophy as he poses after winning his ninth French Open title

Joy: Nadal holds the trophy aloft after he beats world number two Novak Djokovic in four sets

King of clay: The win was the Spaniard's fifth in a row at Roland Garros, and ninth overall

This
 three and a half hour battle, probably not among the greatest they have
 ever fought, represented his ninth Roland Garros title in the past ten 
years, his 66th victory at the tournament where he has only ever lost 
once (to Robin Soderling in 2009).

Nadal
 has now equalled Pete Sampras’s record of fourteen Grand Slam titles, 
and is closing in on Roger Federer’s tally of seventeen. It may be that 
his body is the biggest obstacle stopping him from scaling that 
mountain. He was handed the trophy by Bjorn Borg, who he has now usurped
 by winning Roland Garros five consecutive times.

This
 triumph was slightly different in what preceded it. He lost three times
 on clay coming into Roland Garros this spring – to Nicolas Almagro, 
David Ferrer and Djokovic himself – lulling everyone into thinking he 
was fallible after all. There was even anxiety here that his back was 
starting to hurt as it had done in Australia, although he often throws 
up some concern about his form or fitness mid-Grand Slam en route to 
winning a title.

What he 
retains is that ability to lift his performance when it most matters, 
towards the end of tournaments, much to the despair of his one serious 
challenger on the clay.

Djokovic,
 who came in here as the marginal favourite, had beaten him on four 
previous meetings and believed this was his year to win the one Major 
lacking from his collection, the thing he wants the most.

He
 will be shattered by this, and despite his phenomenal consistency is 
without a Grand Slam title going back eighteen months having lost five 
out of his last six Major finals. The Serb is the bookies’ favourite for
 Wimbledon, where Boris Becker may come into his own as coach, but right
 now there always seems to be someone around to best him.

He
 lamented the fact that his cross court backhand attacking the Nadal 
forehand, such a factor in recent victories, was not as effective 
yesterday as it had been. His harder route to the final perhaps also 
took a toll.

‘At the end of 
the second and the whole third set I struggled a little bit,” he said 
“It’s not impossible, but it’s very, very difficult to stay with Rafa in
 this court, you know, throughout the whole match on his highest level 
of performance. Very hard against him in these conditions over five 
sets.”

It all started so 
well for Djokovic despite the fact that it was another steaming hot day 
that his opponent would have ordered from the Gods for his last two 
matches.

The incredible 
ballstriking that hammered Andy Murray on Friday was nothing like as 
deadly accurate, and the Serb showed is unique ability to handle those 
fizzing Nadal forehand thunderbolts.

They
 traded breaks in the middle of the second set only for Nadal to steal 
it at the death with a break. When the Spaniard leapt ahead in the third
 his opponent looked to be suffering in the heat and set to capitulate 
as so many do when faced with this force of nature on clay.

Yet
 he made a decent contest of it in the fourth, and did not appear in 
much trouble until serving at 4-5. As he trudged to the net he gave a 
sarcastic thumbs up to the heckler.

It
 seems strange to think that Nadal has imploded in the first week of his
 last two Wimbledons. He is on the hat-trick ball this time and will 
know that at 28 he needs to grasp every opportunity going if Federer is 
to be overhauled on the all-time list.
