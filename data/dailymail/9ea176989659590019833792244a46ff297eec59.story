Most people simply throw away food wrapping without a second thought.

But pensioner Eric Bradshaw, 83, is hoping to sweeten his retirement by cashing in on what is believed to be the world's biggest collection of fruit wrappers.

Mr Bradshaw has 2,797 different designs - collected by him and his grandfather before him over more than 90 years - which have been meticulously stuck into albums.

The collection was started in the early 1920s by Mr Bradshaw's grandfather Fred.

Mr Bradshaw, from Camborne, Cornwall, said: 'He fell ill in 1921 and had to give up work.He lost his balance. He was told he had to eat lots of oranges.

'My grandmother said to him, 'Why don't you collect the wrappers?' and it all started from that.'

For many years, citrus fruits were wrapped in decorated tissue-type paper to offer protection.Different suppliers used different designs on their wrappers.

Impressive: Mr Bradshaw hopes to use any money raised from the collection to take his wife on a cruise

Vibrant: The collection was started in the early 1920s by Mr Bradshaw's grandfather Fred. Some of the examples are extremely rare

Eye catching: Many of the wrappers are very exotic including this one from Brazil. It is currently unclear how much the collection might be worth

Some countries still wrap their oranges in wax paper

In more recent times, citrus fruits -
such as lemons, oranges, limes and grapefruit - have been protected by a thin 
coat of food-grade wax, which prevents moisture loss and mould growth, 
minimises bruising and enhances appearance.

Each box of fruit today usually still contains at least one colourful wrapper. Mr Bradshaw said: 'My wife has been online and the largest collections she found was about 200 wrappers.'

'There were about 2,670 citrus wrappers in the collection when I inherited it and I've added another 120 or so. I pop around to the local fruit shop, they know me and hang onto any wrappers that come in.'

The problem now for Mr Bradshaw is what to do with what is potentially a world record collection.

He said: 'There is nobody else in the family who is interested in keeping the collection going, so I shall probably sell it.

'It would be nice to get enough money to take the wife on a cruise.'
