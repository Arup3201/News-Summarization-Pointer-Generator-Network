A transgender man cleared of raping and assaulting a woman burst out of the courtroom weeping tears of joy.

Nadine Natasha Williams, 39, of Pontrhydyfen, Port Talbot, south Wales, had been accused of rape and two counts of assault by penetration after luring the woman into a sex dungeon, the court heard.

Pink-haired Williams, formerly Dean Williams, denied wanting sex with the woman ‘as a last throw of the dice’ before finally becoming a woman.

Tears of joy: Transgender man Nadine Natasha Williams, formerly Dean Williams, was cleared of raping and assaulting a woman after allegedly luring her into a sex dungeon

Williams has been living as a woman for 
more than two years as part of the process of eventually obtaining a 
full sex change, the court heard.

Williams was looking after the house of cross-dressing dominatrix friend Nicky and asked the woman, who is in her 30s, to go to the bedroom as he wanted to 'show off' his female clothing.

During his trial prosecutor Huw Rees said: 'Williams met the woman not long after he had announced he was transgender and wanted to be known as Nadine.

'He wore women’s clothes that day and was very open about his cross-dressing.

'The woman said she would support him through this period of change.'

The prosecution had alleged that Williams pinned the woman down on a bed before raping her in October 2011.

Swansea Crown Court heard that Williams was later arrested wearing just a pair of women's knickers.

He told police: 'She was here earlier on and we had sex together, but but was consensual.'

He denied the offences but admitted that he had sex with the woman but insisted the acts were consensual.

Mr Rees described how the victim agreed to go with Williams for drinks and a meal at the Big Can pub in Neath, south Wales.

Mr Rees added: 'They left the pub and went to the home of a friend of Nadine’s.

'Nadine had told her there was an S&M room there with cages, whips, chains and dominatrix apparatus on the walls in an upstairs bedroom they called The Dungeon.

'Nadine asked if she wanted to see the dungeon and his women’s clothes.

'They went into the room and Nadine suggested they try out some of the equipment but she declined.

'Nadine kissed her and she pushed him away and told him not to be so stupid. He offered to show her his clothes and they went into the next bedroom where he pushed her on the bed, straddled her and ripped off her top and bra.

'While he was doing this he was snarling and growling.

Three not-guilty verdicts: Williams was looking after the house (on this street) of cross-dressing dominatrix friend Nicky and asked the woman, who is in her 30s, to go to the bedroom as he wanted to 'show off' his female clothing

'She was trying to kick him off and she bit his shoulder.

'Her jeans and boots were removed by him and he raped her.

'She said: “I told him: 'No, f*cking get off".'

The woman told the court: “Nadine was telling me about his cross dressing and I said I would support what he was doing.

'It was weird but I’d rather be a support to him than an enemy.'

She also described her shock at being shown the sex dungeon. She said: ‘He was telling me he was becoming an escort and that Nicky was being paid to be a dominatrix and he was trying to get into it.

Shrieks of delight: As Williams heard his not-guilty verdict, Judge Peter Heywood told jurors at Swansea Crown Court (pictured) that it was 'a rather unusual case'

'It was a bit freaky to be honest. I was trying to laugh it off, that’s when he went for me and tried to kiss me.

“He said I should get into it but I said no.'

Judge Peter Heywood explained to the jury: 'He’s altered his name by deed poll and as I understand it he is transgender and is awaiting a sex change operation in due course.'

After the jury returned three not-guilty verdicts, the defendant audibly shrieked in delight in the waiting area outside Court 4.

Judge Heywood thanked the jurors for their service.

He said: ‘It has been a rather unusual case.

‘But jury service is one of the most important things you can ever do and I would like to thank you all very much.’
