The gay marriage Bill was launched yesterday amid fears that it fails to protect registrars, hospital chaplains and even teachers from being sued if they reject same-sex unions.

David Cameron is pressing ahead with the draft law despite fierce opposition from within his own ranks.

Several cabinet ministers have already indicated they would vote against the Bill and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has raised concerns about the ‘robustness’ of protection for faiths.

Fears: A Department for Education source fears that teachers could face the sack if they make a stand against gay marriage despite reassurances from Michael Gove that they would not be punished for their views

Uncertain: Decisions on whether to sack teachers for their views on gay marriage could be down to the European Court of Human Rights and not the Government according to a Department for Education source

Some senior Tories say the Prime 
Minister is in danger of splitting the party over the Bill just days 
after he managed to unite it by announcing a referendum on Europe.

Under the draft law published 
yesterday, gay couples will have the right to marry in civil or 
religious ceremonies if the faith in question chooses to carry it out.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who is
also minister for equalities, said it would ensure ‘equal and fair’ 
treatment for gay couples.

She said: ‘Marriage is a hugely 
important institution in this country – one which has changed throughout
our history, and continues to change. The values of marriage bind 
families and communities together.

‘In opening up marriage to same-sex 
couples we will further strengthen the importance of marriage in our 
society. This Bill protects and promotes religious freedom, so all 
religious organisations can act according to their doctrines and 
beliefs.’

Tory MPs who oppose the law say there 
is no guarantee that faith groups and public sector workers could not be
sued under equalities legislation – and be defeated in the European 
Court of Human Rights.

Some argue that teachers and other 
staff who do not support gay marriage could be punished for failing to 
promote it. A Department for  Education source claimed it may be 
difficult to prevent those with traditional views being dismissed.

Support: Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, is in favour of the gay marriage bill fast tracked by David Cameron, right, but strongly supports the right of teachers to disagree

The measures will also allow civil partners to convert their partnership into a marriage.

There is also special protection for 
the Church of England and Church in Wales, making it illegal for their 
clergy to carry out gay weddings. Mrs Miller said if the Churches change
their stance at a later date, the law can be amended. The cost of the 
legislation to the public sector would be £3.3million to £4.7million.

MPs will get a chance to debate the Bill next month and it is likely to be a combative session.

David Cameron has attempted to head 
off a rebellion by giving Conservative MPs a free vote, but Labour and 
the Liberal Democrats are likely to team up with the Government in 
favour.

Tory MP Stewart Jackson argued that 
unlike other issues of conscience such as the Hunting Bill and the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, the detail would not be examined in 
the Commons because of the swift timetable for getting it through. 
Instead it will be scrutinised by a parliamentary committee.

He said: ‘Those Bills on important 
issues of conscience were fully scrutinised on the floor of the House of
Commons but they want to rush this one through, which will do nothing 
to allay concerns about the protection of religious groups, 
schoolteachers, health workers and other public sector workers.’

David Burrowes MP said the Bill ‘does 
not provide adequate protection for freedom of conscience’: ‘Challenges 
could be made in the UK courts which would run a coach and horses 
through these so-called protections and we have already seen religious 
freedoms are not protected by the European Court of Human Rights.’ 
Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice President of the Catholic Bishops’ 
Conference of England and Wales, said: ‘Alongside many people of all 
faiths and none we will be vigorously opposing the Bill.’

Right and wrong: Mr Cameron with his mother Mary

Even David Cameron’s mother is not convinced about the merits of his gay marriage plans.Mary Cameron, 78, was asked at a lunch why her son was pressing head with the legislation which had alienated many grassroots Tories and said: ‘I know, David just won’t be told’.

The policy was also heavily criticised by local activists and some Tory MPs, but Mr Cameron sees it as central to his modernisation drive. 

He told MPs: ‘I don’t support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.’ 

Mrs Cameron, 78, is a retired magistrate who once said her work had helped her to teach her son about right and wrong.

A biography of the Prime Minister described the family as ‘old fashioned’ and said his stockbroker father Ian was a churchwarden and his mother helped arrange the flowers.

Mrs Cameron, who was born Mary Mount, previously said that Mr Cameron was never short of an opinion, even when he was only five.

In an interview during the 2010 election campaign she said that friends would beg for him to ‘shut up’. She added: ‘He always had something to say’.

Mr Cameron said of her: ‘My mother was a mum at home as it were, but she was a magistrate in the local courts in Newbury, and I always admired her sort of sense of public service and responsibility and putting something back. She is a wonderful mum.’
