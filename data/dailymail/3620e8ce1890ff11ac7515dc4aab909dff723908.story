A 60-year-old woman has been fielding calls for an escort named 'Julia' since her phone number was wrongly listed on online classifieds site Backpage.com.

Nancy Caldwell is a school secretary at Thonotosassa Elementary School who began receiving odd phone calls and text messages at all times of the night and day.

At first, she thought they were just wrong numbers, but when the calls didn't abate in late July, she questioned one of the men about how he got her phone number.

Bad listing: Nancy Caldwell has been getting phone calls off the hook from men looking for a woman named 'Julia'

According to the Tampa Bay Times, the man on the other end responded, 'Uh, you're on Backpage.'

After weeks of suggestive messages and phone calls for the very popular Julia, Caldwell finally had an answer.

Backpage.com is the second-largest online listings site after Craigslist but it's best known for its adult services listings and has come under fire recently for facilitating human trafficking and child prostitution.

Caldwell told the Tampa Bay Times that when she called T-Mobile, her service provider, they told her she needed a police report to change her phone number.

'It's very disruptive, but it's very disturbing,' Caldwell said.

Most of the calls appeared to be coming from the Salt Lake City, Utah area.

According to the Tampa Bay Times, an early August search for 'Julia' in the escorts section of Backpage's Utah site in July came up with one result.

'I'm only in town for a short amount of time and I'm looking for someone to spend it with,' Julia's ad read.

Advertised services: The current ad for 'Julia' whose number is also the contact for 'Kat' and listed on many Utah escort sites

'Like no other woman you have met before... WARNING you may become ADDICTED! Lol'

The Times reports that this ad was accompanied by images of 'Julia' that were actually several different women, including the British soap actress Helen Flanagan.

On August 10, the ad was finally updated and a single digit was changed, presumably to the correct number for men seeking the real 'Julia' - whoever that is.

'Julia' has updated her pictures so that they're all of the same woman. According to her ad, she posts '100% REAL PICS!!!' and is '100% INDEPENDENT and ALWAYS AVAILABLE!!!' but a web search of the newly-corrected phone number comes up with a raft of escort sites.

The profile for a woman named 'Kat' also comes up, who uses the same photographs of several different women as the original Backpage.com ad posted by 'Julia'.

When the Tampa Bay Times called the listed number, a Google Voice account that forwards callers to an online voicemail box was reached. Whoever received the message did not respond. 

According to Backpage's lawyer, people in Caldwell's situation can report the problem to the site, which will attempt to remove any ads with the number in them  - but Backpage may not get them all.

As for Caldwell herself, the calls have declined but she is still receiving calls from Salt Lake City.

'I guess this poor Julia gal isn't getting any business,' she told the Tampa Bay Times.
