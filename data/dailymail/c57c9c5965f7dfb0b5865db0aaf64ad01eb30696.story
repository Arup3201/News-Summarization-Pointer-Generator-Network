Most people love scouring beaches for beautiful shells and smooth pebbles to take home as souvenirs, but this artists goes one better and sculpts her finds into amazing portraits.

Svetlana Ivanchenko from Ukraine turns pebbles, sand, shells and other beach detritus into everything from intricate portraits of faces to scenes showing tigers emerging from the long grass.

But the painstaking process requires patience, as the 50-year-old art teacher carefully sifts the sand and pebbles before sorting them by colour.

Carefully crafted: A beach scene by Ukrainian 
artist Svetlana Ivanchenko, who makes all her work from pebbles, shells,
sand, seaweed and other assorted detritus she finds at beaches

Lifelike: The 50-year-old art teacher spends hours carefully sifting sand and pebbles before sorting them by colour to equip her palette with the textures she needs to recreate images

Proud: This lion's glorious mane has been rendered using sea shells, while the grass and sky are made of sand

A haul of 50g of sand can take Ms Ivanchenko a solid eight hours to sift but once she’s equipped her palette she can set to work.

For the past 12 years, Svetlana, has been dabbling in pebble art and has now had so much success with it that she’s held seven exhibitions to show off her creations.

Inspired by her early love of the Crimean artist Sergey Bakaev, Ms Ivanchenko has been a talented artist since she was a child.

Her love of art took a back seat when she got married and had children but a picture in a magazine of a stunning beach was the kick that she needed to start crafting again.

With the help of her family and friends, who she ropes in to find pretty stones and pebbles, Ms Ivanchenko has now created more than 80 masterpieces.

Luxuriant: A woman relaxes naked beneath grape 
vines crafted from blue sea shells and sea weed in this picture. Ms 
Ivanchenko has held seven exhibitions to show off her creations over the
past 12 years

Feline: Cats, wild and domestic, are a recurring image in Ms Ivancheko's corpus

Moody: Here the artists has used sea shells and pebbles to recreate a dark scene of a wintry beach at dusk

Holy: A sleeping cherub is shown in this work which is reminiscent of the kinds of images painted in churches

With the help of her family and friends, who she ropes in to find pretty stones and pebbles, Ms Ivanchenko has now created more than 80 masterpieces

'I don’t dye the materials or crush them because I think it’s important to make my work out of all natural products,' she said.

'I find making each piece quite relaxing as it requires a lot of concentration and it’s something I can just work on by myself quietly.

'I don’t think people realize exactly how long each takes to make each sculpture and that’s all down to the fact that I’m working with such tiny pieces of material each time.'
