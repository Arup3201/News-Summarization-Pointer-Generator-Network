Kelly Stenson drank half a bottle of vodka before crashing her car into metal gates

A reckless mum crashed her car while driving her two young children after drinking half a bottle of vodka leaving her with one of the highest breath test readings a magistrate had ever seen.

Kelly Stenson, 30, was nearly five times the limit when she was found by cops after a member of the public reported her Toyota Aygo - which had been abandoned.

The mother had smashed her car into some metal gates at around 4pm on January 18.

Police found Stenson and her two daughters, aged just six and three, near the car.

Wakefield Magistrates Court heard that the children were 'upset and distressed'.

Andy Wills, prosecuting, told how a breath test of Stenson, from Crigglestone, West Yorkshire, revealed 171mcgs in 100mls of breath.

At the police station she tested 151mcgs in 100mls of breath - while the legal limit is 35mcgs.

Chairman of the bench Stuart Swallow said: 'The reading that was gathered was one of the highest I have ever come across, and that's something.'

Stenson pleaded guilty to drink driving at an earlier hearing in February, and this week was handed a three-year driving ban.

Roger Clapham, defending, told magistrates that Stenson had been having 'marital problems', financial problems and that she had recently lost her grandmother and had consumed half a bottle of vodka on the day of the incident.

He added: 'It happened once and once only, and because of what happened since, and the time spent in police cells, it will never happen again.'

The court heard how Stenson was voluntarily working with Turning Point and a group called Lifeline to tackle her alcohol use and depression.

In addition to the driving ban, Stenson was given a 12-month community order with a 30-day activity programme requirement.

She was also ordered to pay 85 pounds in costs and a 60 pound victim surcharge.
