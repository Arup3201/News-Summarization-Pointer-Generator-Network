News that Uber is acquiring a mapping service has heightened speculation the cab firm is developing its own driverless cars, including the components and software inside.

Uber is set to close the deal for San Jose-based firm deCarta 'later this week,' and it would lessen Uber's reliance on Google Maps.

The cab service said the acquisition is designed to ‘fine tune’ Uber’s services that rely on maps - but it could also help with the development of an autonomous vehicle.

Uber is set to close the deal for San Jose-based firm deCarta 'later this week,' and it would lessen Uber's reliance on Google Maps. The cab service said the acquisition is designed to ‘fine tune’ Uber’s services that rely on maps - but it could also help with the development of an autonomous vehicle

The accurate navigation technology, for example, could be used to train and test autonomous taxis. 

Uber lets consumers use an app to locate a driver and instantly book a ride.

Google Maps software is already integrated into Uber to let users check progress of drivers on their way to pick them up.

DeCarta was founded in 1996 and provides services including in-map searching, turn-by-turn navigation, location APIs and more.

While it may not be as well-known as Google Maps, its technology is extensively used by consumers.

The OnStar system built into cars made by General Motors, for example, relies on deCarta, as do smartphone makers Samsung and BlackBerry.

In its early years, Google Maps even tapped into deCarta's technology according to the company.

Rumours of the acquisition have been circulating for the past week and Uber has now confirmed its move, although it is not sharing purchase price or financial terms. 

The acquisition bolsters rumours that Uber is planning to build a rival driverless car to Google's vehicle (pictured).  Uber said it will be partnering with roboticists at Carnegie Mellon University to create a centre devoted to research and development of mapping, car safety, and 'autonomous technology'

'A lot of the functionality that makes the Uber app so reliable, affordable and seamless is based on mapping technologies,' the company said in a statement.

'With the acquisition of deCarta, we will continue to fine-tune our products and services that rely on maps - for example UberPOOL, the way we compute ETAs, and others - and make the Uber experience even better for our users.' 

Uber is said to have opened a robotics research facility in Pittsburgh with the intention of creating a self-driving car, going head-to-head with Google's efforts.  

Google was an early backer of the San Francisco-based firm, investing $258 million (£170 million) in the controversial ride-sharing service through its venture capital arm in August 2013. 

David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer and senior vice president of corporate development, then joined the Uber board of directors. 

Last month Bloomberg Business tweeted that Google and Uber are 'going to war over taxis', to which Google's official handle replied: 'We think you'll find Uber and Lyft work quite well. We use them all the time.' This fuelled speculation because the reply is neither a confirmation, or a denial of the reports

In blog post Uber recently said it would be partnering with roboticists at Carnegie Mellon University.

Investors involved in that financing have valued the 6-year-old company at about $40 billion (£26 billion). 

All told, Uber has raised nearly $6 billion (£4 billion) since its inception, including a $258 million (£170 million) infusion from Google's venture capital arm in 2013.

San Francisco-based Uber has grown into one of the world's largest start-ups, and now operates in more than 200 cities in 54 countries around the world. 

But the app's growth has also cause friction with existing taxi operations, and posed challenges for regulators. Uber does not employ drivers or own its vehicles, but instead uses independent contractors with their own cars. 

Since launching in 2010, Uber has also been dubbed a prime example of a 'disruptive' economic force, and taxi drivers in dozens of cities have staged protests against the firm.
