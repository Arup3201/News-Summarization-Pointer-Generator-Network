Two pensioners have had time called on their trips to a south London pub - until they have a wash.

The Crown and Anchor used to be the regular Monday night watering hole for Albert Warren and Edward Basting, as the pair had been drinking there for about a year.

This came to an abrupt end after the pub's manager said he had received several complaints about the personal hygiene of one of the men.

Both men were told they could not return to the pub until they addressed the issue.

Mr Warren, 67, said: 'He practically said we stank. Itâ€™s a bit of a cheek and a bit of an insult. Nobody had ever complained before and we had never had any problems with that pub before.'

His 69-year-old friend Mr Basting added: 'It is not really good enough because I cannot see how he can accept us the previous Monday but then the following Monday he says that to us.

'I find it an insult and defamation of character. I was shocked when this happened, it is not a nice thing to have happen.'

Tom Smith, owner of the pub in Bromley, south London, says Mr Warren and Mr Basting are both good customers and his staff tried to deal with the issue as sensitively as they could.

He said: 'The manager spoke to the two guys outside and did not embarrass them in front of customers.

'We do not wish to exclude people from the premises and all that was said is you must try and do something about your personal hygiene.

'We are not barring them but they need to do something about their personal hygiene and then they will be welcome back in the pub.

'We like the customers we have got to be happy in the setting that we provide.'

However, the offended pair have taken their custom elsewhere.

The two pensioners have since started drinking in another pub on Monday nights and visit other pubs in the area, including the Chatterton Arms.
