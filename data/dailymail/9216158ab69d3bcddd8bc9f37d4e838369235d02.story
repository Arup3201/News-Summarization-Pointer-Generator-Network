The leaders of three of England's biggest cities have warned government cuts will lead to the 'break up of civil society' with chaos on the streets

Council leaders of Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield,  where Nick Clegg
is an MP, called for the government to halt cuts that they say 
unfairly penalise the north over the south, before 'crime and 
community tensions erupt'.

There are also signs of a backlash from rural authorities, mostly Conservative-led, who claim that the shires are losing out disproportionately under the Government's cuts.

The leaders of three of England's biggest cities have warned government cuts will lead to chaos on the streets, such as that seen in London during the riots of 2011

David Cameron and George Osborne announced in the Autumn Statement that councils must find a further 2 per cent of savings in 2014/15, on top of the 27 per cent cuts announced in 2010.

The Labour leaders of Newcastle, Liverpool and Sheffield - where Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is an MP - wrote to The Observer accusing Whitehall of 'Dickensian' views.

'Rising crime, increasing community tension and more problems on our streets will contribute to the break-up of civil society if we do not turn back' they write.

'The one nation Tory brand of conservatism recognised the duty of government to help the country's most deprived in the belief that economic and social responsibility benefited us all.

'The unfairness of the Government's cuts is in danger of creating a deeply divided nation. We urge them to stop what they are doing now and listen to our warnings before the forces of social unrest start to smoulder.'

Separately, The Sunday Telegraph reported that more than 120 rural councils were weighing up a judicial review of the spending settlement for local authorities because it was 'grossly unfair' and would hit services in remote areas.

Roger Begy, leader of Conservative-controlled Rutland Council and chairman of a new campaign called 'Sparse', said: 'Rural authorities for the last 10 to 12 years have been seriously under funded in relation to urban areas.

'For the last 18 months we have been working with the Government reviewing the (spending) formula that takes into account deprivation. Now that has been ignored completely and all the promises ministers made have disappeared. We are going to have to do something.

'This is totally unfair and is going to crucify a lot of rural areas. People are going to be isolated.'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles prompted warnings of further reductions in services when he announced this month that English councils would have their spending power reduced by 1.7 per cent next year.

Mr Pickles claimed the settlement represented a 'bargain' for local authorities, adding that the Government would offer support for the third year so that council taxes could be frozen.

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: 'Councils must keep doing their bit to tackle the inherited budget deficit because they account for a quarter of all public spending and still get through over £114 billion of taxpayers money each year.

'The local government settlement is a fair deal arming councils with an average spending power of £2,240 per household. It is fair to the north and south, and fair for rural and urban areas.

'Councils can protect frontline services and save the taxpayer billions in cash if they share back office services, tap into their healthy reserves and cut out the non jobs and waste.

'Councils that fail to do these things are letting down their hard working residents.'

The council leaders – all from Labour-run cities – have also accused the government of increasing the 'north south divide' through a scheme called the New Homes Bonus.

It sees local authorities all fund a bonus pot that rewards local authorities where new homes are built.

They say it is sucking money from the north as developers build more homes in the south because of the bigger demand and the higher prices that they command.

Figures from public services union Unison reveal that all the top 10 gainers from the scheme in cash terms were in the south while all top 10 net losers were in the north.
