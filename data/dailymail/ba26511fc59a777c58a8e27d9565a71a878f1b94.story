Whatever design you carve into your pumpkin this Halloween, it's likely you'll be using a knife.

Not so 'Wild' Bill Hickok, who finds a Colt 1911 the most practical 'household tool' to use for the job.

This dramatic video shows Hickok, from Nashville, Tennessee, peppering the smooth surface of the harmless vegetable with gunfire to create a spooky Halloween decoration.

The future's orange: 'Wild' Bill Hickok shows off his Colt 1911 and announces his plans for the defenceless vegetable

Good aim: First Hickok fires several bullets into the centre of the pumpkin to create a nose

Scarily accurate: Next the father shoots two eyes into the pumpkin's vulnerable flesh

Speak no evil: The last stage is creating a wonky mouth-shape to complete the traditional Halloween decoration in a very non-traditional manner

First he blasts out two eyeholes, then a nose and then a crooked mouth, which looks as though it has one rotting tooth.

The popular video has now been viewed by almost 200,000 people on his YouTube channel.

It shows Hickok balancing a pumpkin on a tree stump, saying: 'Hey, Hickok 45 here, at the Hickok 
compound.

'It's pumpkin carving time again and like last year we're 
going to use another common household tool, the Colt 1911. Let's get at it.'

Looking a fright: The brightly coloured squash looks battered but certainly has more character

Don't try this at home: Hickok shows the viewer the face that his 'carving' method has left in the back of the vegetable

He then aims his gun at the gourd, exclaiming 'All right!' and 'Nice. The right tool for the job.'

The Colt 1911, also known as the M1911, was designed by John Browning in 1911 and is still widely used today.

It was a standard-issue firearm for U.S. armed forces from its origination until 1985, and is still used by the military in as many as 28 countries.

The single-action, semi-automatic pistol is popular for its stopping power, reliability, durability, accuracy and feel.

It is considered very collectible.

His final verdict? 'Handsome, looks a bit like me.'

Then he turns it around, adding: 'There's a face on the back! Look at that. How'd that happen?

'Oh well. happy Halloween.'

Hickok has something of a history when it comes to attacking the simple squash, having made several other videos that he claims provide 'an education that should be taught in school'.

In 'Pumpkin Killing Methods III', he is seen stamping, sawing, slicing, crushing and shredding them.

He uses hammers, breeze blocks, machine guns and even runs one over with a motorbike.

His techniques are unlikely to appear at a children's carving session any time soon.
