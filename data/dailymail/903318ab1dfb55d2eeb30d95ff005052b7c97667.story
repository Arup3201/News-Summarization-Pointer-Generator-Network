It is not so long ago that Nathaniel Clyne would travel to training sharing doubts about his ability to break into the first-team at Crystal Palace.

'Oh definitely,' smiled Clyne. 'I’ve been on a long journey and making it through the Palace ranks. I was not selected much at the time and then I was fortunate to get in and made my mark and got through.'

He moved to Southampton, two years ago, but it was his former Palace team-mate and regular chauffeur Kieron Cadogan gave his secret away on Twitter.

Former Crystal Palace team-mate Kieron Cadogan tweeted his congratulations after the squad announcement 

'Used to drive this guy to training and he would complain he doubts he’ll get into the first team at Palace,' tweeted Cadogan, now playing in Sweden’s second tier for GAIS, when Roy Hodgson named Clyne in his England squad for the first time.

'Now I’m doing well but the call-up still came as a surprise to me,' said Clyne. 'I still need to improve on my game and hopefully this will be another step for me, to play for England, and hopefully I will improve.

'I’m buzzing. I can’t wait to get started and join in with the lads - they’re world class players - and to see what they are like in training and hopefully I can match up to that. I need to show what I’m about.'

The young right-back has won eight England Under 21 caps and hopes to make his senior bow 

The influence of Saints' bosses present and past in Ronald Koeman and Mauricio Pochettino has been key 

Clyne got a call from the FA on Thursday, only a couple of hours before the squad was publicly released, and the 23-year-old immediately called his mother with the news. 

'She’s been a big part in my career,' he said. 'She was crying on the phone. I’m happy and proud and will go with England to show I’m capable of wearing the jersey. I feel I’m good enough. I have to show that.'

There were thanks, too, for Southampton manager Ronald Koeman. 'He has given me confidence,' said Clyne. 'He says I can be one of the best right-backs in the Premier League. I have grown up.'

The Southampton full-back will be among familiar faces with former Saints players Calum Chambers, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, also in the squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

And he knows others, like Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain from the Under 21 team. 'My aim is to take it step by step but I’m not here for fun,' Clyne added. 'I’m here to nail my colours to the mast. Hopefully I will take that right-back position and make it my own.'

Injuries to the likes of Glen Johnson (centre) and John Stones have boosted Nathaniel Clyne's chances 

Right-back is one of the positions where Hodgson is blessed with no shortage of players, all playing regularly in the Barclays Premier League but, of the senior candidates, Kyle Walker is injured, and Glen Johnson only just back after injury.

Jon Flanagan, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are all injured and John Stones, who played there against Norway and Switzerland, last month, damaged an ankle during Everton’s defeat at Manchester United on Sunday. All of which leaves Hodgson to choose between Chambers and Clyne, or James Milner.
