For more than 1,200 years, nothing had disturbed it.

But in just a few hours, a stretch of Offa’s Dyke – considered one of the most important ancient monuments in Britain – was flattened.

The damage to the aged earthwork, which is in a World Heritage site, was described by horrified experts as akin to ‘driving a road through Stonehenge’. 

Police and Cadw, the heritage arm of the Welsh Government, are investigating allegations that a group of travellers had destroyed part of Offa's Dyke. Above, the section that was dug away

It is believed King Offa of Mercia built it between 757 and 796 to mark the division between Mercia and Wales and protect his land from invasion

Last night, police and Cadw, the heritage arm of the Welsh Government, confirmed they were investigating allegations that a group of travellers had destroyed part of the protected dyke.

The 8th century monument, a linear earthwork which consists of a wide ditch and rampart, runs for 82 miles along the border between England and Wales.

It is believed King Offa of Mercia built it between 757 and 796 to mark the division between Mercia and Wales and protect his land from invasion.

It is a criminal offence to disrupt or damage the dyke, which is designated a ‘scheduled ancient monument’ because of its historical significance, and anyone caught doing so can be punished with six months in jail or a £5,000 fine.

The section affected is close to the Pontcysyllte aqueduct in a spectacular area of countryside centred on the 126ft canal boat crossing, which towers over the River Dee in the Vale of Llangollen, north Wales.

Unesco awarded the 18th century aqueduct world heritage status in 2009, putting it in the category of the Egyptian pyramids, the Taj Mahal and the Acropolis in Greece.

At least 50 yards of the dyke was allegedly flattened last Sunday.

Residents reported seeing men with a large digger clearing scrub and weeds along the dyke, close to the A5 between Llangollen and Chirk.

Over several hours, they flattened the embankment and filled in the ditch to level it.

Jim Saunders of the Offa’s Dyke 
Association said: ‘We had a report that quite a well-preserved part of 
the dyke had been damaged by the new landowner.

'There has been some suggestion that the new landowners are travellers, but we’ve been unable to contact them.’

One witness said: ‘I don’t think the men who cleared the hedge and weeds realised the significance of what they were doing.

'A lady from Cadw who came to inspect it … said what they had done was like driving a road through Stonehenge.’ 

The owner of the field, who claims to have bought the site last month, said he had 'no idea' the area was of historic importance. File picture of Offa's Dyke (not of the area that was damaged)

The owner of the field, who claims to have bought the site last month, said he had ‘no idea’ the area was of historic importance.

The man, who gave his name only as ‘Danny’, claimed: ‘I’ve lived here all my life and I’ve never heard of Offa’s Dyke.

'We bought this from a bloke next door and want to put stables on it. Nobody said anything to us about a historic monument, it wasn’t mentioned.’

When asked if he belonged to the travelling community, he responded: ‘What’s that got to do with it?’

Representatives of Cadw and North Wales police confirmed investigations were under way.
