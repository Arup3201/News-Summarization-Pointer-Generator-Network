Joan Cartwright said she now fears for her life after learning the murderer is due to be released 

The widow subjected to a vile hate campaign at the hands of triple  killer Harry Roberts last night told how she was ‘terrified’ that he was to be released next week.

Joan Cartwright, 71, said nobody had told her about the release of the career criminal – who has threatened to kill her and her husband – and she learned about it only because the story was published in the newspapers.

She said the decision had left her in fear for her life, and she attacked the Parole Board for their decision, saying Roberts is a ‘sick man’ incapable of remorse.

‘I’m absolutely terrified at the thought of Harry Roberts being released,’ said Mrs Cartwright, who runs a sanctuary for around 100 animals. 

‘I’m frightened he will send someone to kill me.’

She added: ‘He shouldn’t be afforded any human rights for what he’s done. What about the human rights of the police officers and people he has killed?’

Five years ago Roberts’s bid to be released from jail was rejected after it emerged he had terrorised Mrs Cartwright and her family after she complained about his behaviour while working on day release in her animal sanctuary in the East Midlands.

Their evidence meant the Parole Board deemed him too dangerous to be back on the streets.

Mrs Cartwright told how she and her late husband, Peter, who died of a heart attack eight years ago aged 68, had been forced to give evidence by the police and prison authorities. 

Despite being assured that they would be protected, documents detailing their statements were leaked to Roberts and sent to him in his prison cell.

It was this blunder by the authorities that allowed him to carry out his campaign of harassment which has made their lives a misery. Under the noses of prison guards, he rang her from jail up to five times a week. And there was a series of sickening attacks on her animals.

Mrs Cartwright broke down in tears as she recounted how one of her horses was hacked to death and almost decapitated in an axe attack the night before Roberts’s parole hearing in November 2005.

In other assaults between 2002 and 2006, a horse lost an eye after being battered with an iron bar; a donkey died after its pelvis was shattered, probably with a baseball bat; the family’s pet cat was electrocuted; and a peacock was strangled.

Mrs Cartwright was not invited to give evidence to the latest Parole Board hearing. Incredibly she learned of his impending release from a local councillor who knocked on her door on Thursday following media reports about his release.

‘I nearly collapsed,’ she said. ‘We were assured he would never come out, so I was shocked.’

Harry Roberts was jailed in 1966 after shooting dead two policemen and another person. The criminal was allowed to work at the animal sanctuary on day release from 2001 until a complaint into his behaviour was made. He is pictured (right) in 2009

It was confirmed this week that Roberts, 78, is to be freed from prison after spending 48 years behind bars for the cold blooded murder of two policemen and another person in West London in 1966.

He is expected to be released from Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire next week. The Mail has learned he is likely to use a false name and will be initially assessed at a probation hostel.

Then he is expected to be transferred to a warden-controlled hostel. He will be entitled to a state pension and housing benefit.

News of his impending release has been condemned by relatives of his murder victims, police leaders and senior politicians, who say he should die in prison.

The murderer was sitting with two accomplices in his van near Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London preparing for an armed robbery when he opened fire on twounarmed officers.

Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, and Constable Geoffrey Fox, 41, were killed in the attack on August 12, 1966.

The case shocked the nation, and Roberts would have hanged for it – but the death penalty had been abolished the year before.

But by 2001 he was working on day release from an open prison at the animal sanctuary. The job was supposed to be a prelude to his release the following year.

‘No-one ever told us who he was, to us he was just another worker,’ Mrs Cartwright added. ‘Nobody told us about his criminal past or that he was one of the country’s most notorious murderers.’

Now, knowing he is about to be released, she says she is unable to sleep and is constantly in fear of attack. ‘My life has been ruined, I’ve had no life for the last 15 years,’ she added.

Detective Sergeant Christopher Tippett was also murdered by Roberts in 1966 when he shot them dead 

‘I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, every night when I lock up the animals I’m wondering if they will still be there in the morning.

‘If the authorities had done their job properly then none of this would have happened.’

Mrs Cartwright was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack on her horse and underwent counselling paid for by the Home Office, but she still breaks down when discussing what happened to her animals.

Today her home is protected by £65,000 of state-of-the-art CCTV and security. Up until two years ago she also had police panic alarms – with a direct line to armed response units – installed in her property.

Now she is hoping they will be re-installed should Roberts be freed, although she is not convinced the police will be able to protect her family.

‘He’s a sick man who has done some dreadful things. He won’t show any remorse for what he’s done – not in a million years.’
