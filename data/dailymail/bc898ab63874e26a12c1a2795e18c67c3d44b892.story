Police say a man who alleges he was shot by former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez has been shot again, this time in the football star’s home state of Connecticut.

Hartford police Lt. Brian Foley says Alexander Bradley was shot several times in the leg Sunday night outside the Vevo Lounge Bar & Grill.

Bradley allegedly then fired shots at the front of the club before being caught and taken to a hospital. He's expected to survive.

'Alexander Bradley is again a shooting victim,' Foley said in a Twitter posting Monday morning.

Fighting back: Alexander Bradley was shot at a nightclub over the weekend and then allegedly began shooting back. In his previous altercation with Hernandez, the NFL star allegedly shot him in the face causing Bradley to lose an eye

'Multiple GSWs (gunshot wounds) to his leg. Major Crimes investigating.'

Police haven't announced any arrests or a clear motive, though his connection to Hernandez has investigators suspicious that it may be tied to those charges.

Bradley alleges in a Florida lawsuit that he lost an eye when Hernandez shot him outside a Miami club last year.

Boston police have linked Bradley and Hernandez to a 2012 double killing, although no charges have been filed.

Police believe Hernandez and Bradley were in an SUV when someone inside the vehicle fatally shot Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado in Boston's South End, according to a search warrant filed by Bristol, Connecticut police.

The warrant doesn't say who investigators believe pulled the trigger in the double killing or suggest a motive. No charges have been filed in the case.

Twisted case: Hernandez, who is originally from and has close ties to Connecticut, is currently being held in Massachusetts on murder charges related to the death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd

Second time as a victim: Alexander Bradley, seen here in an October 2013 court appearance, claimed that the first altercation with Hernandez took place in Miami, Florida

The warrant sought recordings of phone calls made by Bradley while he was jailed in Hartford in October for failing to appear before a Massachusetts grand jury investigating the 2012 shooting.

Investigators say they found the SUV wanted in the Boston homicides at the home of Hernandez's uncle in Bristol.

Shady: The latest twist in the saga comes as prosecutors now say Carlos Ortiz  Ortiz is no longer a trusted star witness

Police say surveillance camera recordings show Hernandez and Bradley going into a Boston nightclub shortly after the shooting victims went into the club.

The recordings also show Hernandez driving the SUV out of a nearby parking garage with Bradley as a passenger shortly before the shootings, police said.

Hernandez is currently being detained on a murder charge in the death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player whose body was found June 17 near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts home.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty.

The Connecticut nightclub shooting is just the latest twist in the ongoing saga, as prosecutors announced on Friday that they no longer view their star witness as reliable.

Carlos Ortiz, 27, who is charged with accessory to murder after the fact in the shooting death of Odin Lloyd, will no longer be called as a witness in Hernandez's murder trial at all.

Ortiz was one of two men allegedly in the car with Hernandez before Odin Lloyd was shot to death.

He was arrested last summer in connection to the murder and told police that Hernandez and another man, Ernest Wallace, 44, were outside their vehicle at the North Attleborough Industrial Park when Lloyd was shot five times.

On trial: Prosecutors allege Aaron Hernandez has been speaking in code about the murder of Odin Lloyd to his cousin and his fiancee

Ortiz said he was asleep in the 
vehicle when he was awoken by the sound of gunshots, after which 
Hernandez and Wallace returned to the car.

He
 also told police that he saw Hernandez carrying a handgun and mentioned
 a 'flophouse' in Franklin which 'other football players used,' where 
police recovered evidence including clothing and ammunition, according 
to the Taunton Gazette.

However, Ortiz has now changed his story to say that Hernandez was alone with Lloyd outside the vehicle.

Prosecutors
 also requested copies of Aaron Hernandez's phone calls from Bristol 
County Jail and records of visitors on Friday, alleging that he has used
 ‘coded messages’ to discuss the Odin Lloyd murder from prison, 
authorities claim.
