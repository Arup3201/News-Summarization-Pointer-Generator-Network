United Airlines passengers flying from New Jersey to London arrived nearly ten hours behind schedule after their initial flight was forced to make an emergency landing.

The Boeing 767-300 returned to Newark Liberty International Airport shortly after take-off when the crew and passengers smelled smoke on board.

After the plane was inspected by a maintenance crew the flight was cancelled and passengers were forced to wait for hours inside the terminal before they could continue their journey.

The plane was carrying 84 passengers and 13 crew when it departed Newark at about 10am local time yesterday.

Flight 922 was scheduled to arrive at London Heathrow Airport shortly after 9pm last night.

But the airline said the plane experienced ‘a maintenance issue’ and the flight crew decided to return to Newark, where passengers disembarked.

Passenger Joshua Sason tweeted that there was a 'smell of smoke emanating from the cockpit area' and the plane's power was 'not working properly'.

The plane flew over New York City before it turned around just west of New Haven, Connecticut

It landed safely less than an hour after take-off and no injuries were reported. 

United Airlines spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said people on board reported an electrical smell in the cabin.

He said: ‘We cancelled the flight so our maintenance team could service the aircraft, and we provided customers alternate flights to their destinations.’

According to data from flight radar the plane flew over New York City before it turned around just west of New Haven, Connecticut.

It then flew over Lower Manhattan before landing at Newark.

Passengers departed Newark a second time late last night and arrived in London at about 6:30am today.
