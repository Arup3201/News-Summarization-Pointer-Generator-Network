A lock of former U.S. President
Abraham Lincoln's hair and items connected to his assassin were
top sellers at an auction that fetched $803,889 in

Fetching $25,000 was the lock of hair removed by Surgeon
General Joseph Barnes shortly after Lincoln was shot by actor
and Confederacy supporter John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865. 

Lincoln died the next day while Booth was shot twelve days later by Boston Corbett, a Union officer.

The authentication letter for a blood-stained linen swatch from Lincoln's death bed shows that there was 'no reason to question or doubt' the swatch's authenticity

The lock of hair was among about 300 items that belonged to
Fort Worth, Texas history buff Donald Dow and is considered one
of the best private Lincoln memorabilia collections known to
exist, according to Heritage Auction officials.

The identities of buyers who took part in Saturday's auction were not available.

Dow, a Fort Worth art gallery owner who died in 2009, built the
collection over five decades, beginning in 1963 with the
purchase of a box of books, according to his son Greg Dow, who
is selling the collection.

'He started collecting because of his interest in the Civil
War and military history,' Greg Dow said.
'But then he became interested in Lincoln and the
assassination.'

An 1861 letter written by actor John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln's future assassin, to a friend boasting about his career and value as an actor, sold for $30,000

Other items auctioned off included an 1864 letter signed by Lincoln and authorizing prisoner-of-war swap involving Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's son from a Union POW camp, for $27,500, and a display of photographs and autographs from Lincoln, Booth and Boston Corbett, the soldier who shot and killed Booth — a set nicknamed "The Martyr, The Assassin and The Avenger" — sold for $30,000

separate eyewitness accounts of the assassination sold for

The military arrest warrant for Booth sold for $21,250 while
a framed compilation of autographs by Lincoln, Booth and Boston
Corbett, the Union officer credited with fatally shooting Booth,
fetched $30,000.  

Don Ackerman, consignment director for historical Americana at Heritage Auctions said the Dow collection gave a 'unique perspective' on Lincoln's assassination.

'The public was so disgusted by Booth's atrocity that most all letters, signatures and documents mentioning him were destroyed after Lincoln's death, making any that survive 150 years later exceedingly rare and valuable,' he said. 

'Considering Mr. Dow's effort to document the assassination
and the nation's reaction, it's fitting the collection is
offered during its sesquicentennial year,' Tom Slate, director
of Americana Auctions for Heritage, said in a statement.

A fragment of a letter Lincoln wrote to a Baltimore attorney in 1862, containing a rare admission that the Civil War was not going well for the north, was one item that went unbought. 

Greg Dow said the time was right for him to sell the
collection.

'I want other collectors to have a chance to enjoy it,' Dow
said.
