A 13-year-old boy with autism kept a prisoner in his own home has been found naked and covered in live rats and their feces in a Colorado Springs home.

The boy is the son of notorious former city councilman Charles Wingate, 43, who was arrested on Thursday along with his wife of 17-years, Sharon Starkey on charges of of child abuse.

Police say they responded to a neighbor's 'check the welfare' call at 6120 Corinth Drive around noon and the door was answered by the boy who was naked, alone and sharing the home with dead and living rodents.

Filthy: This is the Colorado Springs home where the 13 year old boy of Charles Wingate and Sharon Starkey was discovered and taken into protective custody

The unidentified teen told police 
that he is an only child, has been home schooled and does not ever 
remember being outside his house - while neighbors said they have not 
seen the child in several years.

He was taken to a local hospital and then released into the custody of the Department of Human Services.

Charles Wingate resigned from Colorado Springs city council in disgrace in 2003 after allegations he downloaded porn and ordered pizza with a city credit card

'When we get these types of reports, our officers respond and do a very 
careful scene investigation,' Colorado Springs Police spokesperson Larry
Herbert said.

'It's very important to the elements of the offence in a 
child abuse case.'

In an 
interview with local Colorado Springs newspaper, The Gazette, Wingate 
denied his home was unsafe to live in and that he had neglected his 
child.

'My son at all times has been loved and protected and cared for,' said Wingate.Â 

'The
fact that someone will take this situation and try to blow it into 
something of how he was somehow abused or neglected or not taken care 
of, that's a total inaccurate description of the situation.'

Wingate
also said the boy, his biological son, is not autistic. "I'm not going 
to discuss my son's medical condition. That is a very private issue with
me.'

Wingate was a Colorado Springs City Council member from 2001 until his resignation in 2003.

He left office under a cloud following accusations of embezzlement, forgery and fraud.

Police alleged he kept a $190 advance for a council trip and stole the number of a Colorado Springs Utilities credit card and ordered pizza with it.

He pleaded guilty to the embezzlement charge, but denied that he downloaded pornography onto a city-owned computer and was never charged.

Colorado Springs Police spokesperson Larry Herbert said When we get these types of reports, our officers respond and do a very careful scene investigation

On her Facebook page, Starkey lists First United Methodist Church as her employer, and in online profiles says she has worked with children with disabilities for years.

In 2003, Wingate resigned from the council and pleaded guilty to felony embezzlement of public funds.

He was ordered to jail in 2006, after a judge found he violated probation in the case.
