A Chinese magician has set up an online spell shop that is reportedly earning him more than £100,000 a month.

Luo Shun, 32, began his magic business in 2002, but launched his online spell emporium last October to open up his customer base.

The magician from Hunan province sells more than 160 spells or products which range in price from £3 to £218.

Mr Luo sells his spells on Taobao, China's answer to Amazon. 

Services: Spells include typical good luck wishes such as good health, riches, and successful careers

The Epoch Times reported that the most popular spell is called 'a change of heart' - designed to  to repair the love lives of 'those who have just broken up or where the other party has become cold and distant in romance, as well as married couples or lovers who have been apart for a period of time.'

Other spells include typical good luck wishes such as  good health, riches, and successful careers as well as a spell to improve relations with their mothers-in-law. 

One of them is an 'abortion atonement spell' - in China abortion is high due to the state's one-child policy.

Mr Luo initially studied accounting, but he dropped out of his course after two years and after deciding that his future lay in the ancient Chinese art
of feng shui/

'I witnessed many quite 
mysterious scenes and I wanted to find the answers,'  Mr Luo told The Daily Telegraph.

The Epoch Times reported that for some spells, like the one for good mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships, buyers need to contact the master for specific instructions on how to use the spell.

But most can be used by placing the written spell under the pillow, wearing it around one’s neck, or carrying it around at all times.

'Writing spells is a sacred thing,' he told the newspaper.

'[You must] calm your 
heart, shower and change clothes [and] be guided by the Holy Spirit.'
