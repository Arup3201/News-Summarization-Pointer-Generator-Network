Police now believe that the four Iowa teens who went missing Saturday met online via Xbox.

The two girls and two boys are thought to have run away together after the boys took one of their parent's cars and then allegedly drove across the state for four hours to pick up the girls.

The girls, Skie Floyd and Jazlyn Visek, both 15, were last seen around noon Saturday at a park in Shellsburg, Iowa.

Investigators believe the girls are with 13-year-old Austin Michael Boggs and 16-year-old Corey Sunderman from Atlantic, Iowa, which is roughly 200 miles from Shellsburg.

Corey's mother spoke to ABC News and 
said that she became concerned that her son and his friend may run away 
after they got into trouble on Friday night.

The two boys snuck out of the 
Sunderman's home on Friday to go skateboarding but they were brought 
back by police because they were out past curfew.

'This is going to sound really stupid,
but I took all the shoes downstairs and put them in a bag and took them
up to my room, thinking if I had the boys' shoes, they couldn't go out 
and go skateboarding again,' Crystal Sunderman told ABC.

The boys found extra boots in the 
garage and left home later that night, taking $400 from Corey's father's
paycheck, his mother's laptop, and the family's 1997 gold Jeep 
Cherokee. The car does not have license plates.

Corey has run away from home twice before but he has returned both times and has no criminal history.

Police had their biggest break in the 
case when a local storeowner reported that he had seen the boys driving 
that car early Saturday morning.

The owner said that he allowed the boys to use the shop phone but only if they did so on speakerphone.

'The conversation was something to the
effect of, 'Don't pick us up at our house. Pick us up at the Quick 
Stop,' said sheriff Randall Forsyth.

That version of events matches up with the story that the girls' parents have pieced together.

'At this point we're 99.99% certain what we have here is a runaway, not an abduction,' Sheriff Forsyth said.

The mother of one of the missing 
girls, Skie, told KCRG: 'I know my daughter is scared right now, I'm 
sure she wants to come home.'

Floyd, who is 5ft 1ins, was last seen 
wearing a black hooded sweatshirt with white pin stripes, dark jeans and
black boots. She weighs roughly 115 pounds and has blonde hair.

Visek, who has brown hair and  green 
eyes, was last seen wearing a gray zip-up sweatshirt with 'Arrow' 
printed on the front, blue skinny jeans and Nike shoes. She has two lip 
piercings, weighs 185 pounds and stands 5 feet 5 inches tall.

Now the parents are left waiting for 
any contact from the four teens, and wondering what they could have done
to prevent the situation.

'I don't let him have a Facebook account because I don't want him meeting people online,' Mrs Sunderman said.

'I didn't realize they could do so much on Xbox.'
