North Korean defectors are planning to attach DVDs of The Interview to 15-foot helium balloons, which they will send over the border into their home country.

Fighters for a Free North Korea, led by former government propagandist Park Sang Hak, has for years used the tactic to smuggle transistor radios, DVDs and leaflets into North Korea.

If all goes to plan, the latest move will see dozens of copies of the Seth Rogen movie released from South Korea and drifting for several hours before scattering over Pyongyang.

Few people have access to any uncensored media in North Korea, but the regime is particularly opposed to The Interview as it involves a CIA plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong-un.

The Human Rights Foundation in New York, founded by Thor Halvorssen, has been helping fund the balloon drops and said the next one is due in January.

Halvorssen told The Hollywood Reporter that the past dozen or so drops have included copies of movies and TV shows like Braveheart, Battlestar Galactica and Desperate Housewives.

Although The Interview will not be out on DVD at the start of next year, Halvorssen said copies of the comedy will be included in the drops as soon as it is.

He added: 'Viewing any one of these is a subversive act that could get you executed, and North Koreans know this, given the public nature of the punishments meted out to those who dare watch entertainment from abroad,'

'Despite all of that there is a huge thirst for knowledge and information from the outside world.

'North Koreans risk their lives to watch Hollywood films ... and The Interview is tremendously threatening to the Kims. 

'They cannot abide by anything that portrays them as anything other than a god. This movie destroys the narrative.'

The 15-foot long helium balloons are capable of reaching heights of around 16,000 feet and can drift for hundreds of miles, before timers tell them to release their loads.

As well as DVDs and radios, they are also used to distribute any-regime propaganda, highlighting the severe human rights abuses and starvation suffered by the population, alongside the lavish lifestyle of the leadership.

The Interview has been the center of controversy since hackers targeted Sony Pictures Entertainment, after North Korea denounced the movie, leading to speculation that the country could be behind the cyber attack.

Over the summer, North Korea warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate'. It said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation.

Anger over the depiction of the brutal assassination caused a hacking cell called Guardian of Peace to launch a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, leaking thousands of damaging documents. The group also threatened terrorist attacks on the United States.

The move led cinema chains - including the New York City location due to host the premiere - to pull out of showing the film after the hackers promised 9/11-style attacks. 

Officials at the Department of Homeland Security have said the attacks are not credible - but many theaters have still decided to back away from screenings. 

The cancelled screening coincided with celebrations in North Korea, as people took to the streets of Pyongyang today to mark the official start of Kim Jong-un's reign.

Horns and sirens sounded in the oppressed country to mark the end of a mourning period for the dictator's father, Kim Jong Il, who died three years ago.

The ceremony - in line with a Korean custom of mourning one's parents for three years - marks the true commencement of the younger ruler's reign, as the last vestiges of his father's regime fade. 

Since the death of his father, Kim Jong Un has indicated he wants to build the economy and improve the nation's standard of living. 

But he has also held firm to the North's longstanding - and extremely costly - focus on strengthening its military and developing its nuclear weapons capabilities.
