Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard insists he was never likely to join Paris-Saint-Germain after putting pen to paper on a new five-and-a-half-year deal at Stamford Bridge. 

Hazard, who joined the Blues from Lille for £32 million back in 2012, is thought of as one of European football's brightest talents and it is no surprise that some of the continent's elite suitors have pursued him in recent seasons.  

PSG, who play Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday, were known to have an interest in signing Hazard, but the 24-year-old says any speculation that he would leave west London came purely from the media.

Hazard recently put pen to paper on a new five-and-a-half-year deal to keep him at Stamford Bridge until 2020

'PSG? Personally, there was never anything in that,' he told Telefoot, 'The newspapers talked about it a lot but I knew from the start I would stay at Chelsea.' 

Chelsea played PSG in the quarter-final stage of the Champions League last season, defeating them on the away goals rule after overturning a 3-1 first-leg deficit.  

And Hazard is backing his team to overcome the French giants again this year in the last 16. 

'I don't think it was a miracle against them last year,' he said. 'We shouldn't have lost 3-1 in the first leg, we should have played better some counterattacks. And we made two defensive errors.

'We were a little bit lucky to score in the last minute. It will be a whole other game this year. We're on a good run, we're first in the league and we've got reinforcements.'

PSG are currently third in Ligue 1 with 49 points, just one behind leaders Lyon who have 50
