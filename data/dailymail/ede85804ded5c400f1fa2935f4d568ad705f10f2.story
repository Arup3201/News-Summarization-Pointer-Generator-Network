The wife of the gunman killed during this week's cafe siege will have her bail reviewed at Sydney's Supreme Court.

Man Haron Monis's wife, Amirah Drouis, has been on bail since being charged with involvement in the murder of his ex-wife Noleen Pal in 2013.

NSW Attorney-General Brad Hazzard recently expressed concern she was out on bail and asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to review the decision. 

Mr Hazzard said that 'The charges laid against Amirah Droudis are extremely serious and her alleged actions involve a murder'.

'On behalf of our community I want to know whether every aspect of her being on bail has been examined in all possible detail.' 

Ms Drouis has been reporting to the Campsie Police Station daily, after police launched an urgent search for Man Haron Monis's partner on the day of the Sydney siege after her mother reported her missing. 

Ms Droudis had acted as Monis's spokesperson for many years, delivering YouTube messages on behalf of the self-declared sheikh.

In one video uploaded in 2009, a niqab-clad ‘Sister Amirah’ proclaims she is a terrorist. 

Man Haron Monis's partner, Amirah Droudis, shared his extremist views 

On the morning of the siege Ms Droudis had been reported missing by her mother 

Police arrived at Ms Droudis's family home in Belmore, but were informed that she was at a Wiley Park address.

The residence is the same one she shared with the gunman before he was killed in the siege which claimed the lives of Katrina Dawson, 38, and Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson. 

The review comes after questions were raised as to why gunman Monis was also out on bail, a detail which saw him free to interact with the community and allowed him the freedom to be in Martin Place. 

Monis walked into the Lindt cafe in Sydney's busy Martin Place around 9.30am on Monday, pulled a shotgun from a bag and took 18 people hostage. The siege ended in a hail of gunfire almost 17 hours later when police stormed the cafe. 

Ms Droudis is on bail charged with murdering Monis's ex-partner Noleen Pal in 2013 

If the original ruling is overturned, Amirah Droudis could be taken into custody.

Monis came to the attention of police when he sent hate-filled letters to the families of dead Australian soldiers seven years ago.

He also faced dozens of indecent and sexual assault allegations before his death on Tuesday.

Mr Hazzard has asked the DPP to review any cases where bail has been granted and where there may be any similarity to the circumstances of the Monis matter.  

He was charged with being an accessory to the murder of Ms Pal, who was stabbed and had her body set alight.
