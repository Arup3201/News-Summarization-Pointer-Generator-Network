Bridget Jones need no longer be ashamed of her massive pants.

Although big beige knickers have been voted men's biggest lingerie turn-off, one supermarket has come to rescue soft-edged women everywhere, designing a line of sexy underwear that will banish lumps and bumps while still looking glamorous.

And with pieces starting at £6, the collection from George at Asda is up to 350 per cent cheaper than current high street offerings.

The new line aims to hug curves in all the right places and features lace detailing and leopard-print patterns

George's sexy control lingerie, designed to give women 'the perfect hourglass figure', was created to meet shopper demand for more glamorous, purse-friendly controlwear after 52 per cent of shoppers said they were bored of 'plain beige Bridgets' and wanted something sexier.

Tried and tested on women size 12 and 14, the line - part of the shop's Bodysculpt range - hugs curves in all the right places and features a collection of 
gorgeous lace detailing through to sexy leopard print patterns.

The 
revolutionary collection not only proves that control-wear can be just 
as stylish in the underwear stakes but has been approved by women across
the nation.

After a survey revealed that three quarters of women who shop in Asda envy the hourglass figure of Kelly Brook, the range was designed with her shape in mind.

Bodysculpt control dresses from George at Asda start at £10, while their briefs start at £6

George's animal print control body will retail for just £10, 350 per cent 
cheaper than competitor versions on the high street costing £45 and 
upwards, offering the same great style, quality and confidence boost for
a fraction of the price.

George's Entice Animal Control dress retails at £10, while the Spanx equivalent is sold on their website for £109.

With 43 per cent of women spending over £200 on 
control lingerie a year, and 29 per cent revealing they spend more on their 
controlwear than the outfit itself, the George version is the perfect 
solution for savvy savers.

Since the rise in the fashion for 
bodycon style dresses loved by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, 
Cheryl Cole and the X Factor's Tulisa, George has reported a huge rise 
in the demand for control wear with weekly sales set to double as we 
move into the party season and the frocks come out.

Fiona Lambert, George Brand Director said: 'We know control underwear is
a real wardrobe staple for many women and 64 per cent have told us that it 
helps increase their confidence levels at the Christmas party.

'We wanted
togive our shoppers a great new addition to our range by offering them 
more affordable and glamorous versions to what is currently available on
the high street.

'Our new collection of sculpted underwear not only 
smooths lumps and bumps but also looks gorgeous.

'For that reason, there 
will be no more undressing in the dark to hide unsightly briefs. We 
hope this new range will give shoppers a helping hand this party season 
and help them to showcase their fabulous assets in the run up to 
Christmas.'
