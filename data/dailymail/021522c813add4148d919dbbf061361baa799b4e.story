Suspended perilously across a Lake District mountain range, these brave mountaineers need a head for heights as they traverse a rope bridge which is twice as high as the Shard.

At a dizzying height of 2000ft the bridge
 on Fleetwith Pike is among the most elevated in the world, and at 350ft
 is the longest in Europe.

The bridge, dubbed the the Lake District Skywalking Burma Bridge, links two peaks of the mountain together and forms part of Honister Slate Mine's Via Ferrata Xtreme experience. It took a team of 15 to 20 workers three months to complete and is so long it is not always possible to see the other side in cloudy weather.

Via Ferrata is Latin for Iron Way and the original routes consisted of a series of metal cables, rungs, ladders and bridges across the Italian Alps which soldiers used to carry munitions and supplies to their allies during both World Wars. The route on Fleetwith Pike is the first in the UK.

Sky high: Thrill seekers have been lining up to traverse this rope bridge on Fleetwith Pike in the Lake District, which, at 2,000ft is twice as high as the Shard

Head for heights: Mountaineer Alan Hinkes traverses the bridge, which stretches 350ft between two mountain peaks, making it the longest in Europe

Dizzy: The tip of Fleetwith Pike, home of the via ferrata route is 2,126ft high, compared with the Shard in London which measures 1,016ft

The Via Ferrata at Honister Slate Mine was first opened in 2007, when a cable was positioned along the mountain face, using tracks originally used by miners to traverse the peak.

Its name meaning 'Iron Way' in Latin, via ferrata routes consist of rungs, cables, ladders and bridges positioned into mountain ranges and were originally used by soldiers during both World Wars as a means of getting across the Italian Alps and the Dolomites.

At the outbreak of the First World War the Dolomites were part of Austria Hungary, and fierce battles were fought between Italy, part of the alliance, and Austria in the mountain range, with both sides trying to gain control of the peaks where observation stations and guns could be positioned.

Trenches, dugouts and other relics of the First World War can still be found alongside many via ferratas in the Dolomite region.

Today via ferrata routes remain popular with climbers, particularly in Italy, Germany, France and Spain, as they enable thrill seekers to climb technical rock faces without the need for a large amount of training and with only minimal amounts of equipment - such as helmets and harnesses.

The Lake District route was the UK's first, but has not been without controversy.

Plans to make the route larger by including a 1.2km zip wire were blocked by Lake District National Park planners in 2011, and a revised plan rejected in January 2013. Opponents argued against it on environmental grounds and said the proposed zip wire was too close to a walking route from the Honister pass to Haystacks, Alfred Wainwright's favourite fell.

Lake District mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington, who supported the expansion scheme, quit his role as Vice-president of the Friends of the Lake District after the group opposed the extension, which was originally proposed by the late mine owner, Mark Weir, who was killed in a helicopter crash in March 2011.

Iron way: Via Ferrata is Latin for Iron Way and the original routes consisted of a series of metal cables, rungs, ladders and bridges across the Alps

Purpose: On the original via ferrata routes a series of metal cables, rungs, ladders and bridges were installed on the mountains to help soldiers ascend and descend treacherous climbing routes across the Alps

Area: The bridge cuts through the picturesque surroundings of the Honister pass, home to the Honister slate mine and often dubbed the wettest place in England

History: The bridge links two peaks of Fleetwith Crag, the side of which has been commercially quarried for its high-quality green slate since the 1750s. Slate mining and quarrying at Honister did stop in 1986, but restarted in February 1997

Safety first: All visitors to the via ferrata are given safety equipment including a helmet and harness and are accompanied on their journey by a guide

Popular: Via ferrata is popular among many thrill seekers because it does not require a huge amount of training, and enables climbers to reach elevated peaks they might otherwise not be able to

Controversy: Plans to make the via ferrata route larger by including a 1.2km zip wire were blocked by Lake District National Park planners in 2011, and a revised plan rejected in January 2013
