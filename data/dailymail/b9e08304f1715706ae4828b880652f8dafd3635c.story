Joanna Michael's family, from Cardiff, have lost a Supreme Court appeal to sue two police forces over her murder in 2009

The family of a young mother who was stabbed to death by her jealous ex-boyfriend after a 999 blunder say they are 'shocked' by a Supreme Court ruling which means they cannot sue police  for negligence.

Joanna Michael, 25, from Cardiff, phoned the police twice in fear of her life before being knifed 72 times by her 19-year-old boyfriend Cyron Williams in 2009.

Now the Michael family has been told they cannot sue the two police forces involved, despite a police watchdog ruling that the young mother was failed by South Wales and Gwent police. 

But the Supreme court ruled the family can still attempt to bring a claim under European human rights laws  - a move which officers had tried to block by relying on a precedent from the Yorkshire Ripper case.

Speaking after the landmark ruling, Ms Michael's mother Angela said police 'could and should' have done more to protect her 'beautiful' daughter from the 'savage murder'.

She said: 'I have lost a wonderful daughter and her children have lost a loving mother and provider.

'I have brought this case to secure damages for the children and also to make police answerable for their failures to deal effectively with a serious domestic case.

'I am shocked that five of the seven court judges found that the police were not negligent. I take some comfort that the appeal may bring this problem to the attention of the nation.' 

The ruling, which has given both hope and disappointment to domestic violence campaigners, is another step in what has become a long legal battle for the family.

They first won the right to try to bring a claim against both forces in 2011, but their case was thrown out by the Court of Appeal last year.

Judges had ruled that, under common law, police have immunity from being sued for negligence for their actions during 'the investigation or suppression of crime'.

That decision was upheld today in the Supreme Court with a 5-2 majority, when judges rejected the claim that police owe a duty of care in negligence where they are aware or reasonably aware of a threat to the life or physical safety of a person. 

The family had launched the legal action after 'individual and systemic failures' meant the emergency services arrived too late to save Ms Michael's life, despite her frantically phoning 999 twice in just 15 minutes. 

Nicholas Bowen QC, appearing for Ms Michael's family, told the Supreme Court the case was 'desperately important', particularly with regard to cases of domestic violence.

He told the panel: 'There is a need for a heightened accountability of the police in the light of recent scandals and investigations which have had a very serious detrimental affect on public and political confidence in police services.'

During the hearing, Mr Bowen described how Williams had broken into the young mother's home 'in a mad fit of jealous rage' after he discovered she was in a new relationship. There had been a history of domestic abuse, it later emerged.  

The court heard how Ms Michael had made her first 999 call on a mobile phone to the police at 2.29am on August 5 2009. She told the Gwent Police operator that Williams had come to the house and found her with someone else.

He had then bitten her ear hard and taken the other man away in his car, saying he would return later to kill her.

Mr Bowen said the 'urgency was absolutely plain' and an immediate response could have meant police reaching her in five minutes.

But the call went through Gwent - 'the wrong police force' - and not South Wales, as it should have done.

The Gwent operator then told Ms Michael to 'stay put' in the house and keep the phone free so South Wales Police could phone her back, said Mr Bowen.

According to the appeal court judgment, the operator spoke to South Wales Police  and said Williams had threatened to return to 'hit' Ms Michael but did not refer to 'the threat to kill'.

It meant the call, which should have continued to be graded as requiring an immediate response, was instead graded at the next level down.

At 2.43am, a further 999 call was received by Gwent Police from Ms Michael. In that phone call, she could be heard screaming before the line went dead.

A court heard how 'individual and systemic failures' meant the emergency services arrived too late to saveMs Michael's life 

Police officers arrived at Ms Michael's home six minutes later, at 2.51am. She was found to have been stabbed by Williams 72 times.

Williams pleaded guilty to murdering his former girlfriend and was jailed in for life in 2010, with a minimum 20-year tariff.

Mr Bowen told the court that the 'factual picture' revealed there were 'crucial legal duties owed to Ms Michael's estate by the police'. 

He argued that officers had failed to arrive in time and possibly save her life because of unacceptable delays.

These were caused by individual and systemic errors of the police which justified them having to face damages claims for negligence, he said. 

Her family has been trying since 2011 to win their right to sue South Wales and Gwent police

Separately, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) previously ruled that Ms Michael was failed by South Wales and Gwent Police. They criticised both police forces for individual and organisational failures.

Mr Bowen added that police were claiming immunity from being sued, largely relying on the 1989 case of Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire - the 'Yorkshire Ripper' case. 

All seven justices unanimously dismissed the cross-appeal by the chief constables of South Wales and Gwent Police to block the family's right to claim under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Right to Life.

Finally, five members of the Supreme Court panel dismissed the family's case. The two dissenting judgments in favour of allowing the appeal coming from Lady Hale and Lord Kerr.

But dissenting judge Lord Kerr said: ' If the police force had not negligently downgraded the urgency of Ms Michael's call, on the facts as they are known at present, it is probable that she would still be alive.'

The anti-domestic violence campaign group Refuge, which had intervened in the case, said it was 'deeply disappointed' that the panel majority had decided the police could not be held liable for negligence.

It is calling for a public inquiry into the way in which the police and other statutory agencies in the UK respond to victims of domestic violence.

But the group said it was 'encouraged' by the unanimous Supreme Court finding that the Michael family was entitled to pursue its Article 2 human rights claim against the police, saying that should give hope to 'hundreds of recently bereaved families of domestic homicide victims'. 

Chief executive Sandra Horley sd: ;Joanna Michael, the mother of two young children, died a needless death. No court ruling will change that. Just like hundreds of other victims of domestic violence Joanna was failed by the police when she reached out for help.'

She added: 'We are delighted that Joanna's family may now, at least, progress one step further down the long path to justice and that their Article 2 claim, seeking a declaration and compensation from the state, may now proceed.

'This judgment has wider, positive, implications for abused women and children. It secures a small increase in police accountability and widens a previously very narrow doorway to justice for hundreds of recently bereaved families of domestic homicide victims.'  

Liberty's lawyer Rosie Brighouse said: 'Time and time again, police are failing victims of domestic violence - but, thanks to these archaic rules, even the most breath-taking police negligence goes unchallenged.'

Sarah Ricca, solicitor for both Refuge and Liberty, said: 'The fight to achieve equal protection from the law for women facing domestic violence will continue, inside and outside the courts.

'This case was an important step in that fight. The highest court in the land has had to address and acknowledge the stark reality of police failings in relation to domestic violence. Though part of the battle in this case was lost, the rest of the case proceeds. That is an important victory in itself.'
