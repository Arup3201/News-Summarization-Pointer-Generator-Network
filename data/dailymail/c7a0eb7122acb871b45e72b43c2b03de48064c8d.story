A Ferrari-driving killer who thought he had 'got away with murder' before plundering the bank accounts of his victim's dead parents was today jailed for 32 years - after being caught out by a bank clerk who spotted his fraudulent signature.

Donald Graham, 60, murdered his heiress lover Janet Brown in 2005 before stealing from her parents' accounts to fund his lavish taste in cars and to buy his second mistress a home. 

He also spun a cruel web of lies to make
 her elderly parents Eric and Olive Brown believe their daughter - whose
 body has never been found - was still alive.

Donald Graham, 60, has been jailed for 32 years for murdering Janet 
Brown, 45 and hiding her body, before plundering her elderly parents' 
bank accounts to fund a 'flashy' lifestyle

But he was caught four
 years later when a bank clerk at Skipton Building Society grew 
suspicious of the signature used on Mr Brown's bank account.

Ms Brown went missing before she was due to go on holiday to France in 2005

During his sentencing today, Mr 
Justice Openshaw said Graham had been posing as Mr Brown in a bid to transfer money out of the account when the employee became suspicious.

The police began investigating when the 
bank branch tried to write to Mr Brown about the fraudulent signature 
and realised he was dead.

That realisation led to a fraud investigation - which soon turned into a murder inquiry.

Jailing him at Newcastle Crown Court for 32 years, the judge said Graham must 'pay the price' for the terrible crime.

He said: 'All these offences 
were made possible only by the murder and he used the money to fund his 
extravagant and flashy lifestyle.

'The defendant has been convicted of a terrible offence, and must now pay the price.'

The murder took place after Graham and Mr Brown, who had been lovers for about eight years, arranged to go on holiday together to France in 2005.

But at the last minute, Graham pulled out of the holiday, pretending his wife was ill and Miss Brown decided to go alone.

It was around the time of her planned departure on June 17 that she was murdered.

Today,
 the judge said Graham must have been 'astonished' when her parents fell
 for his claims that their daughter was still alive.

The judge said: 'As the months and years passed he must have come to believe he had indeed got away with murder.'

Graham went on to befriend Ms Brown's parents.

When they died, he plundered their bank accounts, despite their wish that their estates should go to Guide Dogs for the Blind if their daughter died before them.

They died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was working in a bank in Switzerland.

Just before she disappeared, Miss Brown transferred £300,000 into her married lover’s account.

He went on to strip another £285,000 from the Brown family, the judge heard, and tried but failed to get hold of their £300,000 farm.

Graham, who lived on a 40-acre property in Sparty Lea, south west Northumberland, hid her body so well it has never been found.

Graham was caught out after a clerk at a Skipton Building Society branch grew suspicious of the signature given by Graham on Miss Brown's father's bank account. Her suspicion led to the murder investigation

Graham gained the trust of Ms Brown's parents and plundered their bank 
accounts after their deaths so he could buy 'flash' cars, including this Ferrari

The judge said: 'He was once a JCB digger driver, he could have disposed of her in some deeply-dug pit or put her down one of the many mine shafts in the area, or buried her in some wild and remote place.

'That he disposed of her body is obviously an aggravating factor.'

The murder was driven by financial gain, the judge said, which was another aggravating feature.

Graham was sentenced concurrently for his 'audacious' frauds on his victim’s parents, which he committed after gaining their confidence.

Despite repeated searches by police, Ms Brown's body has never been 
found. Her parents Eric and Olive Brown died believing that their only daughter was working for a Swedish bank

He began to do Mr Brown’s shopping and slowly gained his trust and confidence, making regular visits to their home at Plane Trees Farm, Lowgate, Hexham, Northumberland.

This meant he was able to gain access to all Miss Brown’s bank documents and personal affairs, as well as Mr Brown’s cheque book and details of his pension.

Even after both parents died Mr Graham went on to arrange their funerals without telling relatives.

But he did obtain a death certificate which, with all the other information he had gained, meant he went on to strip their estate of all their assets through false telephone calls and false withdrawal slips.

He was badly in debt and was struggling to fund the finance agreements on the sports cars, including a Ferrari, which he loved.
