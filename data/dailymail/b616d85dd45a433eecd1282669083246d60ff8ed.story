A woman who tried to shoplift $11 worth of frozen food from Walmart allegedly threatened to infect an employee with HIV. 

Diamond Lawrence, 25, attempted to walk out of the Forest Lane Walmart in Dallas with the food when she was confronted by the employee.

According to NBC DFW, as Lawrence was escorted to the back of the store, she said: 'I can infect whomever I please.' 

Arrested: Diamond Lawrence, 25, scratched the neck of an employee at the Dallas store in a deliberate attempt to draw blood and expose him to HIV after she was caught shoplifting

She then reportedly struck the sales associated in the face and scratched his neck in what they believe was a deliberate attempt to draw blood and expose him to the virus. 

Records state Lawrence told the employee repeatedly 'you're welcome' after the attack.  

Officers said she was wearing a medical wristband that identified her as having HIV. 

The employee was checked out by Dallas-Fire Rescue crews, but no known bodily fluid was exchanged.

Wal-Mart doesn't prosecute for shoplifting the amount of small items, but asked Lawrence to never return to the store.

However, she had two outstanding arrest warrants for public intoxication and an invalid driver's license.

Lawrence is in the Dallas County Jail. Her bail is set at $1,500.

Walmart doesn't prosecute for small amounts - so she was only banned
