Thousands of opponents of abortion received a glowing endorsement from the Pope via twitter when they turned out for the 'March for Life' to protest legalised abortion on the 41st anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic Roe v Wade decision.

Tweeting from his official account (@Pontifex) Pope Francis gave support for the demonstrators of the event who had turned out in freezing temperatures to march on Capitol Hill.

The Pope's tweet read: 'I join the March for Life in Washington with my prayers. May God help us respect all life, especially the most vulnerable.'

Francis, who has emphasised a broader focus on poverty beyond divisive issues, sent his support for the annual event, which takes place in January every year and attracts many Catholic high school and College students from across the U.S.

This year, the march began on the National Mall with a rally, followed by protesters then walking along Constitution Avenue to Capitol Hill and the Supreme Court, flanked by police officers protecting their right to free speech.

Founded by Nellie Gray in 1974, the March for Life consists of a series of events and prayer vigils leading up to a rally, before a march on the National Mall in protest of the 1973 Supreme Court declaration that abortion is a constitutional right.

Roe V Wade was the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalised abortion within the first two months of pregnancy. Before it, state laws regulated abortions, forcing women to take dangerous, often illegal measures to get an abortion.

In Texas in 1969, Norma McCorvey (later given the alias Jane Roe) was single and pregnant, and wanted to have an abortion. But under state laws, she was unable to have abortions except in the cases of incest or rape, so she claimed she was raped to get an abortion. This was thrown out.

McCorvey sued for the right to an abortion. After a legal battle, the district court ruled that Texas laws infringed on Ninth and Fourteenth amendments of the constitution (right to privacy and citizens’ rights).

Eventually her case landed in the supreme court, where they ruled that ‘the right to privacy is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy’.

The event has attracted serious media attention each year since it began, bringing with it big-name speakers, such as former president George W. Bush.

This year, the theme of the march was 'Adoption: A Noble Decision', espousing the benefits of giving a child up for adoption as an alternative to abortion.

Protesters came from Georgia, Missouri and Pennsylvania, with youngsters coming from schools and colleges in Chigaco and Cleveland, among others.

Protests were heavily documented on Twitter, with many members of the march holding signs that read '#TeamLife' to spread their message.

While there were mostly cheers and upbeat chants, the crowd booed when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia issued a statement that said there had been an expansion of abortion coverage during the nation's health care overhaul.

President Barack Obama also issued a statement, saying the 41st anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision is a chance to 'recommit ourselves to the decision's guiding principle: that every woman should be able to make her own choices about her body and her health.'

The annual anti-abortion rally, was expected to draw tens of thousands of activists into the freezing cold Washington D.C. weather

Beverly Miller, 39, of Mankato, Minnesota, made her first trip to join the march with her son Joseph, 15, and youth from their church. Her local diocese rented buses and drove 20 hours to the nation's capital to join the event.

She said: 'When we get together in a group like this and we see that there's hundreds of thousands of other people like us, it gives us strength and courage and hope that we aren't alone. If we stand together, we really can make a difference.'

Two expectant mothers had sonograms before the Kansas Senate Public Health Committee, in an event that was called a 'science education' by some and a 'political stunt' by others, on the same day the 'March for Life' anti-abortion protests took place in Washington D.C.

One of the expectant mothers, Amanda Kennedy, 20, agreed to be sonogrammed in the  Committee in Topeka to give committee members a demonstration of what happens in the womb.

Kennedy, an anti-abortion activist, who is 12 weeks pregnant, said: 'It is a little bit of a political statement, but it was important because it is something I believe in.'

Senator Mary Pilcher-Cook, the committee's chairwoman, said: 'I thought it would be a great way to give committee members a science education on life within the womb.'

In opposition, Elise Higgins, of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, said: 'A committee room is not an appropriate place for medical procedure to happen. It's also not a place for medical procedures to be legislated.'

The procedure was performed on two women by a sonographer from the Wyandotte Pregnancy Clinic, a crisis pregnancy centre that offers free sonograms and counselling to women who weighing whether to have an abortion.
