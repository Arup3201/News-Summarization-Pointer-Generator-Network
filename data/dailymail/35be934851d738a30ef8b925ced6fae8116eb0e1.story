The horrific ordeal of a British tourist who escaped the Egyptian hot air balloon disaster then watched his wife plunge to her death was relived yesterday.

Michael Rennie, 49, jumped 10ft to the ground from the burning basket, then ran 250 yards along a track chasing the balloon screaming ‘My wife. My wife’.

But he could only watch in horror as the doomed craft rose rapidly into the skies and exploded at 1,000ft above Luxor, then plummeted to the ground along with its passengers.

Tragedy: Michael Rennie watched his wife Yvonne plunge to her death in a horrifying hot air balloon disaster

Happier times: The Rennie couple are their wedding day. Michael Rennie screamed helplessly 'My wife!' as the burning basket rose higher in the sky once he jumped out

Desperate: With severe burns on his body, he then helplessly ran along a 200 metre dirt track, pictured, to a group of houses to raise the alarm

Survivor: Michael Rennie was airlifted to hospital after he survived the blaze which killed his wife Yvonne

The Egyptian pilot, whose clothes were on fire, leapt out just before Mr Rennie and was the only other survivor.

Mrs Rennie, 48, from Perth, Scotland, 
was among 19 tourists killed on Tuesday morning. Other victims included 
artists Joe Bampton, 40 and Suzanna Gyetvai, 34, who lived in Clapham, 
South West London.

Four of the dead had tried to leap from the balloon 
as it rose. Mr Rennie suffered burns to his face and shock but is in a 
stable condition in a Cairo hospital.

The same balloon, operated by Sky Cruise, had been involved in another crash less than 18 months ago, it was revealed yesterday.

Video footage shot in October 2011 
showed the balloon narrowly missing a hotel roof in Luxor before 
plunging into the Nile. Luckily, all the passengers on board that flight
escaped with nothing worse than bruising.

Yesterday Sky Cruise produced paperwork showing the balloon was checked and certified airworthy in October 2012.

Tuesday’s tragedy is believed to have 
happened near the end of the dawn flight, after a landing rope became 
entangled with a propane gas tube, severing it and sparking a fire.

Mohamed Youssef Mohamed, 27, a pilot for Magic Horizon balloons, was on his own balloon at the time.

‘One of my tourists on board pointed 
out that the balloon appeared to have caught fire on the right-hand 
side,’ he said. ‘It was just two or three metres from the ground and was
about to land but the pilot was quickly engulfed in flames and flung 
himself out of the basket.

‘Seconds later, on the other edge of 
the basket, the British survivor jumped out. By the time it reached 70 
metres I saw four people fall – I’m not sure if they jumped or if the 
basket opened due to the fire. This was all before the sound of the gas 
explosion.’

The whole incident took a little over 
two minutes. Another witness, a holiday worker called Mohamed, said: ‘It
was a horrific sight. The scene was pure hysteria. The pilot Momen 
Murad was a professional with around 10 years of experience flying hot 
air balloons and was well known in Luxor as a skilled flier.’

An investigation is underway by Egyptian authorities and all balloon flights have been grounded.

Ahmed Mohamed Al Yemeni, Luxor’s 
deputy public prosecutor  who is in charge of investigating the 
incident, said: ‘Investigators are searching for evidence of a technical
malfunction of a gas canister used. It appears likely the gas was 
largely responsible for the accident.’

Yesterday Mr Rennie’s brother David 
complained that he had ‘not been told anything’ by Thomas Cook, the tour
operator used by the four Britons. He said he could not speak about the
disaster until he had seen his brother, who works for a construction 
company, but the family ‘were grieving for our loss of Yvonne’.

Mrs Rennie joined the radiology department of Perth Royal Infirmary as an appointments officer in June 2006.

Radiology manager Douglas Mitchell said: ‘We are in shock at the sudden and tragic loss of Yvonne.

‘She was a much-loved colleague who 
enjoyed her job and her tragic passing has had a huge impact on all of 
us who knew and worked with her. She will be sadly missed.’ Mr Bampton 
and Miss Gyetvai both worked for Lots Road Auctions in Chelsea.

They were described by their neighbours as ‘a quiet, lovely couple’.

Mr Bampton was originally from 
Merseyside before moving to London to become an expert valuer of rugs 
and carpets. His Hungarian-born partner was also known by her artist 
name, Zsi Chimera.

Investigation: An Egyptian inspector of the Civil Aviation Authority walks among the wreckage. Shocked eye-witnesses told yesterday how the pilot and a number of passengers jumped from balloon at around 300ft as it was being towed into land and hit a power line

Tragedy: At least 19 foreign tourists, including some British citizens, have been killed after their hot air balloon exploded and fell from the sky
