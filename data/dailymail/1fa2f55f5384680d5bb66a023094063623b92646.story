Manuel Pellegrini has warned his players that Manchester City must not dwell on last season's success as the Premier League champions attempt to defend their title and conquer Europe.

City won a league and Capital One Cup double in Pellegrini's first season at the club, and the Chilean also guided them to the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time before losing to Barcelona.

As he prepared for City's second pre-season tour game against AC Milan in Pittsburgh on Sunday, Pellegrini vowed that he will not rest on his laurels.

Room for improvement: Pellegrini is doing his best to take his players to the next level

'We won the title last season but this year is another year,' he said. 'We have new targets, we will try to make important achievements in the Champions League and to once again win the Premier League.

'So I think that what happened last year is in the past. For our team now it is important to think of the future - and the future is to continue winning titles.

'Every year in the Premier League you have five or six teams who are very strong. Maybe this year Chelsea at the moment, and Arsenal and Manchester United are bringing new players in.

'But I think that we will continue to be a very strong squad. We have also been bringing in three or four important players to improve our squad. And we will see during the year which is the better team.

'But I continue thinking we have a very strong squad and we will try to win the title again.'

City have signed goalkeeper Willy Caballero, defender Bacary Sagna and midfielder Fernando, and hope to buy FC Porto centre-back Eliaquim Mangala for Â£32million.

It means that some players will be leaving but Pellegrini insists that Stevan Jovetic will not be one of them.

He added: 'Stevan is working well with us. He is a very important player for our team. Maybe there are a lot of rumours about his future but Stevan will stay with us here.'
