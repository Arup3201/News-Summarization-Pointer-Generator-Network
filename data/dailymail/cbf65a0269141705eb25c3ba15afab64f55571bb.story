Two young women have died after apparently overdosing on substances after a weekend of drug-related tragedy which has left three families mourning young women.

Jennifer Whiteley, 27, was rushed to hospital in the early hours of Saturday morning after taking a party drug but died after suffering a cardiac arrest at 5am.

And a 29-year-old, named locally as mother-of-one Gemma Hurst, died in hospital in Newcastle yesterday morning having suffered a serious reaction to what police believe was an ecstasy tablet.

The incident, which came on the same weekend as a teenager died in an Oxford park after allegedly taking ecstasy, brought the death toll by the drug to 13 this year, prompting police to warn of the dangers of taking drugs which may be stronger than expected or adulterated with poisonous substances.

Tragic: Gemma Hurst has died after suffering a serious reaction to what police believe was an ecstasy tablet

Investigation: Police guard the Newcastle home of Gemma Hurst, 29, who is believed to have died after taking ecstasy

The 27-year-old woman, from the Sale area, was rushed to hospital in the early hours of Saturday morning but died a short time later.

Police are now investigating whether she had earlier taken the banned legal high Benzo Fury. Officers originally believed she may have taken ecstasy pills.

They have not ruled out the class A drug but said they will not be able to confirm the cause of death until further toxicology tests have been carried out.

It is understood Jennifer had taken the drugs with her partner at her home. It is thought both needed hospital treatment but Jennifer's partner later discharged himself.

As part of the police probe some Benzo Fury powder had been recovered by officers.

Detective Inspector Frank Morris said: 'Our thoughts go out to the family of this young woman following this tragedy. We will not be able to confirm the cause of this woman's death until we get toxicology results, and we are also working with HM Coroner.

Response: Police and paramedics were alerted to a house in the east of Newcastle after concerns were reported about a woman inside

'However, we recovered a powder which is a "legal high" known as Benzo Fury, the legality of which is the subject of ongoing attention by the relevant authorities. Taking drugs can not only have dire consequences for the person taking them but also for their family and friends.

'Police officers do not want to make the house visit and inform them that they have lost a loved one. If you experience any adverse effects, please seek urgent medical assistance.'

Benzo Fury, a mild stimulant that acts like amphetamines, is one of two legal highs which was banned for one-year by the government last month.

'Our thoughts go out to the family of this young woman following this tragedy' 

- Detective Inspector Frank Morris

The government's advisory council on the misuse of drugs will assess whether the ban on the two drugs should be made permanent.

Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said it was being done to 'protect the public' and prevent 'misery'.

In the incident in Newcastle, police and paramedics were alerted to a house in the east of the city after concerns were reported about a woman inside.

The 29-year-old woman was taken to the city's Royal Victoria Infirmary after suffering a serious reaction to what police believe was an illegal substance.

Today neighbours named her as Gemma Hurst, who is believed to have had a young son and who is said to have been hosting a party in memory of her brother Paul, who died five years ago.

Friends posted tributes on Facebook today, with one from Shelley Marie Bias, saying: 'Seriously cannot believe it. All my love to Sheila and family. Gemma, you were a beautiful friend. You and Paul look after each other. Gone way too soon. RIP.'

The young woman died in hospital in 
the early hours of this morning and police have arrested two people in 
connection with the incident. Officers seized a number of what are believed to be ecstasy tablets and 
eight other men and women from the address were taken to hospital to be checked over before being arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs.

A number of what are believed to be ecstasy tablets have been seized by police, who this afternoon bailed ten people pending further enquiries.

Two people, a man aged 33 and a woman aged 23, have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs and are helping police with enquiries.

The new tragedies come after three deaths in 
Macclesfield, two in Bolton, two in Wigan, two in Buxton, Derbyshire, 
and further fatalities in Salford and Warrington.

Chief Constable Peter Fahy, of Greater Manchester Police, warned partygoers that criminal gangs were mixing the drugs with poisonous substances to make more money.

The latest deaths mean 13 people have died this year from the drug, and have prompted a police warning about its dangers - they are particularly worried about super-strong 'pink ecstasy' (file image)

He said: 'We have been concerned about deaths 
due to drugs and overdoses and at the same time particularly concerned 
that criminal gangs are mixing and adulterating drugs with poisonous 
substances.

'People who take drugs need to be 
extremely careful and if they have any information about who may be 
producing this stuff they need to get in touch with us.

'It goes without 
saying it’s being produced by criminal gangs and a lot of them are 
reckless about what they put in there and are quite prepared to put in 
all sorts of substances and mixing it just to make more money.'

Further south, 15-year-old Martha Fernback died on Saturday after allegedly taking a super-strength 'pink ecstasy' tablet, also known as Dr Death or PMA.

Martha, an only child, was found by a lake in Hinksey Park, south Oxford.  She was airlifted to the John Radcliffe hospital but pronounced dead soon afterwards.

A 17-year-old boy who was arrested in connection with the investigation has been bailed until September 5.

 'These drugs have become more available and they are a much dirtier form: they are highly potent and potentially lethal.'

  - Dr JS Bamrah, consultant psychiatrist

PMA is an ecstasy-style amphetamine which can be five times stronger than ecstasy and can kill by causing a potentially fatal increase in body temperature.  It can be an ingredient in ecstasy tablets.

Last week, an inquest into the death of 19-year-old fitness instructor Travis Barber, from Salford, Greater Manchester, found he had died after overdosing on PMA.

His mother Dr Louise Barber warned other drug users they were playing ‘Russian roulette with their lives’ by experimenting with the drug.

Dr JS Bamrah, consultant psychiatrist at Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust, said the health service across the region had witnessed a spike in drug users falling ill after taking ecstasy, particularly PMA.

He said: 'The problem is these drugs have become more available and they are a much dirtier form of the drug; they are highly potent and potentially lethal.

'What we are noticing is that users are becoming younger and younger. The drugs have a very strong stimulating effect and cause heart rates and temperatures to rise dramatically which can result in medical complications.'
