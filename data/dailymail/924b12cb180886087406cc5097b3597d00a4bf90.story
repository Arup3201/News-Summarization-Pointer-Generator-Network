A senior Tory has attacked David Cameron's 'illegal and unworkable' plan to force fat people to go on a diet or lose their benefits.

Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the influential Commons Health Committee, said she was 'infuriated' by the proposal, announced last week.

She has written to the Prime Minister to demand he drops the controversial plan.

David Cameron has been criticised by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston over his plan to cut benefits for people too fat to go to work if they don't go on a diet

Dr Wollaston said Mr Cameron was effectively asking doctors and nurses to break the law, because all patients had the right to refuse treatment.

She said threatening to take away people's basic income meant the government was forcing people to get help.

At the moment there is no requirement on addicts to seek help before they claim sickness benefits. Cameron has launched a review to see if he can change the rules.

But Mr Cameron said people who cannot work because they are too fat – or addicted to drugs or alcohol – should have their benefits cut if they refuse to get treatment.

He pointed to Government figures which show 100,000 people claim benefits for 'treatable conditions'. Less than 2,000 are on benefits because they are too fat to work.

But Dr Wollaston, a former GP, said: 'A doctor would not only find themselves in breach of the law, they'd find themselves at risk of being struck off. So in fact, his proposal is utterly unworkable in terms of the existing law.'

The MP for Totnes told BuzzFeed News that she was 'infuriated' by the proposal which she suggested was a dog whistle to right wing voters who think everyone on benefits is lazy.

She said: 'It's really unnecessary and it's all part of, in my view, trying to appeal to a sort of particular group of people who see that everybody on benefits is somehow there because it's their own fault. We shouldn't go down this route.

'We need to have a compassionate Conservative message, in my view, and this isn't a compassionate Conservative message – this is frankly illegal and unworkable.'

Dr Wollaston said the proposal was 'indefensible'.

Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, has defended the proposal

She called on Number 10 to issue an urgent clarification that 'there will be no enforced referrals' of obese patients for treatment.

The MP added: 'If you say to somebody: 'We will remove everything you have to live on unless you go to this thing', all you'll have is people pitching up just to tick the box, they won't engage with treatment so it won't work, and it would count under the law as an enforced referral and it would be illegal. So I can't stress this enough, they need to withdraw it and they should do it immediately.'

On Saturday, Mr Cameron defended the plan. He said: 'People have problems with their weight that could be addressed, but instead a life on benefits rather than work becomes the choice.

'It is not fair to ask hard-working taxpayers to fund the benefits of people who refuse to accept the support and treatment that could help them get back to a life of work.'

Number 10 made it clear the benefit cuts, worth about £100 a week, were a personal priority of the Prime Minister.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has insisted the policy does not mean taking away people's benefits if they cannot lose weight.

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, he said: 'The problem we've got is that lots of people are either fearful or don't want to take the help that's there.

'We invest in the help, whether it's to support people to get off drugs . . . or whether it's to get people into a particular mindset to reduce their weight because their health condition's so bad.

'What we want is people to take that help and to take responsibility for their condition and try to improve. No one's going to penalise anybody who tries.'
