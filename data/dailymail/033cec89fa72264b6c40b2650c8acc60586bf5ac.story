A Minnesota man who veered into oncoming traffic last year while allegedly having sex, killing two people, has pleaded guilty in exchange for a recommended four-year prison term.

Mark Anders Chalin, 24, entered his guilty plea to criminal vehicular homicide on Monday in Blue Earth District Court.

Prosecutors say Chalin, of Mankato, smashed into a car being driven by Jonna Martin, a 35-year-old engaged mother of four on August 7, 2011, on County Road 90.

Mark Chalin and Amber Menezes were having sex when Chalin crashed his car, killing her as well as a mother-of-four in the another car

Jonna Martin, a mother of four, was also killed in the collision when the car she was driving was hit

Witnesses told police that just before 
the collision, they saw Amber Menezes straddling Chalin in the driver's seat, 
blocking his view of the road.

Martin, of Lakeview, and Chalin's passenger, 23-year-old Menezes, were killed and Chalin was hospitalised for 45 days with 26 broken bones.

An obituary in the Mankato Free Press said Mrs Menezes is survived by her husband Chris.

Chalin told Judge Bradley Walker Monday that he agreed to plead guilty because he doesn't remember what happened, but understood a jury had enough evidence to convict him.

He said he remembered leaving his father's house in Delavan with Menezes in his car and making a couple of turns while driving to his apartment in Mankato.

Amber, seen here on her wedding day, was survived by her husband Chris. She was blocking Mark Chalins view while he drove as she was straddling him

'The next thing I remember is waking up in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,' Chalin said. 'I don't remember which day.'

Assistant Blue Earth County Attorney Chris Rovney is recommending a 48-month sentence as part of the plea agreement. Chalin's attorney, Jacob Birkholz, said he planned to argue for a lesser sentence.

Menezes' mother, Michelle Scholl, who attended the hearing, said she doesn't support the plea agreement.

She said: 'I will never have grandchildren from my daughter. She was somebody who did something with her life. He is a repeat offender.

Country Road 90 in Minnesota, where the fatal smash took place. Chalin will be sentenced in December.

'He has taken no responsibility. How can
you be sorry for something if you don't think you did anything wrong? 
That's my question.'

Chalin has a record of more than a dozen past charges, including harassment and trespassing.

Martin's fiance, Roger Thompson, didn't attend. He said during a June hearing that he had already used up all of his vacation time to be at earlier hearings.

Chalin's sentencing hearing is scheduled for December.
