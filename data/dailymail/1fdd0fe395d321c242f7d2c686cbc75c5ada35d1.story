A woman has been rushed to hospital with potentially life threatening injuries after falling head-first off the back of a new Routemaster bus.

The passenger, aged in her thirties, fell from the platform of the double-decker in Kentish Town at 7.20am.

Paramedics treated her for a head injury at the scene in Ferdinand Street, near the junction with Prince of Wales Road.

She was then taken to St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington where she was in a potentially life-threatening condition.

Police
are investigating the accident on the No24 bus - which was heading 
south on the route between Grosvenor Road and The Royal Free Hospital - 
at the junction with Ferdinand Street. It is not being treated as 
suspicious.

A Met 
Police spokesman said: 'Police were called at approximately 7.24hrs on 
Friday 4 October to reports that a woman in her mid 30s had fallen from 
the rear of a double decker bus in Prince of Wales Road, NW5 at the 
junction with Ferdinand Street.

'The woman was taken by London 
Ambulance Service to a west London hospital with head injuries which are
described as potentially life threatening.'

The
incident has led to a call from one London Assembly Member to halt the 
introduction of the new Routemasters across the capital on safety 
grounds.

Darren Johnson, Green Party Member and Transport Committee Member said: 'In light of today’s tragic incident 
as well as concerns raised by disability and other campaign groups, the 
Mayor should order an immediate halt to the production of these 
vehicles.

'Londoners’ safety must come first and there are serious doubts hanging over the Mayor’s flagship bus today.'

He
added:'One of the main reasons why hop-on hop-off buses were phased out
of London’s transport system years ago was that they are not 
appropriate for a modern, accessible public transport system.'

The original routemasters were built between 1965 and 1968 and operated in regular London passenger service until 2005.

The Routemaster withdrawal coincided with the introduction of London's single-deck bendy buses, however these proved accident prone and unsuitable for London traffic.

Despite making up just 5 per cent of the London bus fleet, the bendy buses were involved in 20 per cent of all bus-related deaths in the capital.

In his mayoral campaign ahead of the 
2008 election, Boris Johnson pledged to return the Routemaster to rid 
the capital of the accident prone bendy buses.

The
Mayor of London hit back at Darren Johnson's critique, accusing the 
Green Party Member of speaking without knowing the whole story.

‘My primary concern is for the well-being of the woman who was injured in this incident,’ Boris Johnson told Mail Online.

‘A TfL investigation is underway but it would be wholly inappropriate to comment further until all the facts are known.

'It’s
a sad indictment of Darren Johnson that he has chosen to pre-empt that 
investigation without knowing all the facts, and instead has used this 
passenger’s misfortune to try and score political points.

'The
second staff member whose job it is to guard the back platform comes at
a cost of £62,000 per bus per year - £37m in total across the 600 buses
in operation – but even with this extra staff member, a passenger fell 
onto the road and suffered serious injuries.

Transport for London also said it would carry out a 'thorough investigation'.

Mike
Weston, Transport For London’s director of buses, said: 'Our first 
concern is, of course, for the passenger and we can confirm the 
emergency services attended the scene. There will be a thorough 
investigation into this incident.'

Destruction: The collision on Chelsea Bridge Road, London, left twisted wreckage strewn across the carriageway

The new generation of Routemasters, 
nicknamed 'Boris buses' after the London Mayor who introduced them at a 
cost of £354,500 each, came into service last year after replacing the 
iconic old version, which was phased out in all but a few tourist routes
in 2005.

But since the latest incarnation of the popular buses were reintroduced they have been hit by problems before.

Three
people were hospitalised last month after being injured when a new 
Routemaster bus smashed into a queue of stationary traffic.

The
number 11 bus was on its first day in service which it slammed into a 
two other buses and a line of cars during the six vehicle pile-up.

Transport for London has confirmed the bus was not following its normal route - between Liverpool Street and Fulham Broadway, on September 21 - when the crash happened at about 1pm on Chelsea Bridge Road.

And in July, the buses left passengers fuming after faulty air conditioning caused temperatures on board to soar.

Heat levels on some of the buses were found to have exceeded the maximum allowed for transporting farm animals across Europe.

Upper-deck heat levels were recorded at more than 30C, according to an Evening Standard investigation.

The design of the new buses differs from the older version like this one pictured at Charing Cross. With another two doors, the queues will disappear much more quickly
