Drug smugglers packed hollowed out fruit with 16.5lbs of cocaine worth £750,000 in an attempt to smuggle it into the country by plane.

Hidden among a delivery of fruit and vegetables, customs officers discovered the illegal haul when the flight from Ghana landed at Heathrow airport on Tuesday.

The cocaine was discovered inside plantains, a banana-like fruit, which had been filled with packages of the drug and resealed before being packed with other products.

Illicit: One of many plantains stuffed with cocaine in a fruit and vegetable delivery from Ghana that was intercepted at Heathrow

Border staff believe the same gang 
was responsible for sending 1.5-tonne of cannabis hidden in a shipment 
of fruit and vegetables from Ghana also intercepted at the airport the 
previous day.

The contraband was worth £4.3 million when sold by dealers on the street.

Marc Owen, Heathrow director for Border Force, said: 'It seems likely 
that the same criminal gangs were involved in both of these two 
smuggling attempts.

Thwarted: Customs seized imported illegal consignment, worth £750,000, which was stuffed in these banana-like fruit and resealed before it was flown to the UK

'This means that in just two days we have put a £5 
million dent in their profits.

'These two seizures demonstrate the success we’re having in disrupting 
criminal smugglers and keeping illegal drugs off the streets of the UK.'

The cannabis seizure was the biggest at Heathrow Airport in more than three years.

Haul: The hidden drugs were stashed amongst fruit and veg in airfreight containers and was discovered the day before another consignment, this time of cannabis, believed to be the work of the same smuggling gang

The discoveries come just months 
after a mother-of-three was accused of smuggling 220lbs of cocaine, with
a street value of £44million, into Heathrow.

Shopkeeper Paula Sanchez, 32, was 
arrested at her home in north London following a sting operation after 
the drugs were found in a food package that arrived from Ecuador at the 
London airport.

The package was thought to belong to a major South American drugs cartel.

Dent in profit: Customs at Heathrow, pictured, 'have put a £5 million dent in their (smugglers') profits' after discovering both the consignments this week
