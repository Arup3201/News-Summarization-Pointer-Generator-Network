Vermont Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy has set off on the first congressional mission to Cuba following Obama's announcement on Dec. 17 that Washington would start normalizing ties with its old Cold War foe.

Leahy is heading a group of four Democratic senators and two Democratic representatives, all of whom have visited Cuba in the past and who strongly support Obama's policy, a statement from his office said.

Their three-day trip aims to get an idea from Cuban government officials of how they see the normalization process and convey a sense of what Americans expect.

Leahy of Vermont (R), next to representatives Debbie Stabenow of Michigan (C), Chris Van Hollen of Maryland (L), Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island (2-L) and Peter Welch of Vermont (2-R), talk to the media upon their arrival to a hotel in Havana, Cuba,

Politico quotes the Senator: 'We have all been to Cuba before, and we strongly support the president’s new direction for our policy toward Cuba. We are going this time to discuss our expectations, and the Cubans’ expectations, for the normalization of relations.'

Sen. Claire McCaskill says she will also visit the country, with a schedule still undecided.

Leahy's group will return from Havana Monday, though the Senate will be on vacation in observance of the Martin Luther King federal holiday.

New York governor Andrew Cuomo is also slated to visit. 

Separately, the United States and Cuba are holding high-level talks in Havana next week on normalizing ties.

A package of new rules came into effect on Friday implementing Obama's policy shift by opening up the island to expanded U.S. travel, trade and financial activities.

The U.S. embargo on Cuba, in place for 54 years, remains in place, however, as only the U.S. Congress can lift it.

While Cuban President Raul Castro has welcomed last month's deal, he has made clear that Havana does not intend to abandon single-party rule or state control of the economy. Congressional critics of Obama's shift say Washington should not be rewarding Cuba.

Cuomo's upcoming trip to Cuba was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
