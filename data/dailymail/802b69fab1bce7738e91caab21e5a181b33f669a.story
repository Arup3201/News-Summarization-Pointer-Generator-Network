A bride-to-be has been killed in a car crash as she drove to her bachelorette party.

Collette Moreno, a 26-year-old mother-of-one, was being driven to Lake Ozark, Missouri by her best friend on Friday afternoon when they tried to overtake a truck but were hit by an oncoming vehicle.

She later died from her injuries.

Moreno's fiance, Jesse Arcobasso, sobbed as he spoke about his loss just four weeks ahead of their wedding date, and revealed her five-year-old son can't yet comprehend where his mommy is.

'He doesn't quite understand everything just yet,' Arcobasso told KCTV as he was comforted by family members. 'I know it's going to take time.'

Loss: Collette Moreno has been killed just four weeks before she was due to marry fiance Jesse Acrobasso

Moreno, 
who lived in Kansas City, and her best friend, Ashley Theobald, were 
driving on Missouri Highway 5 on their way to a weekend of partying when
 the tragedy unfolded.

The
 bride had shared her excitement on Facebook in the hours before - 
uploading a photo showing her drinking wine to mark the start of the 
weekend and sharing a selfie of her and Theobald on the road just 
minutes ahead of the crash.

Speaking
 to KCTV, Theobald said that Moreno had started suffering from an asthma
 attack as they trailed a truck with heavy exhaust fumes, so she had 
attempted to get past it on the two-lane road.

'We both thought it was clear and there 
was a hill that neither one of us saw,' she said through tears.

'I 
tried to go around and there was a truck coming and I swerved and he 
swerved with me.'

Joy: Ahead of the crash, Moreno shared this photo, left, showing her starting the bachelorette weekend celebrations with a glass of wine. She is also pictured right at her bridal shower three weeks ago

Theobold, driving a 2013 Chevy Malibu, saw the oncoming 1999 Dodge Ram, driven by 25-year-old Melvin E. Garber, as it crested the hill and both drivers swerved to avoid colliding.

But the Dodge struck the passenger side of 
the women's car, which then hurtled off the left side of the road. The Ram traveled on the right side of the road and crashed, and both cars were totaled.

Theobald and Garber both suffered minor injuries, and when Theobald spoke to Moreno - who had been wearing a seatbelt - she was conscious but not responding.

'I was talking to her. She couldnâ€™t talk
 back but she was nodding at me,' Theobald told Fox3. 'I didn't know it was 
as bad as it was because she wasn't physically super beaten-up.'

The women 
were taken to University Hospital in Columbia, where Moreno was 
pronounced dead from her injuries at 5.30pm, three hours after the 
crash.

Devastated: Her fiance, Jesse Arcobasso, sobs about his loss as he is comforted by family members

Overwhelmed: Theobald said she thought her best friend was OK because she did not look hurt

As soon as Arcobasso, 28, learned about the accident, he headed to the hospital.

'I was just trying to hold on to the fact that she was going to be okay,' he said.

The Missouri Highway Patrol has said Theobald will face no charges.

Moreno's death has left her family, friends and fiance devastated. The pair, who became engaged last year, were due to get married on July 26 in Jamaica.

Her son Braden, who lived with Moreno and Arcobasso, has also been left without a mother. His father lives in the Kansas City area.

Friends have set up a fundraising page to help raise money for Moreno's funeral and for her family - most of whom live in California - to travel to Missouri.
