Jailed: Louise Pollard stole £15,000 from two couples who were desperate for children before claiming she had miscarriages

A couple have spoken of their agony after conwoman surrogate Louise Pollard took advantage of their longing for a baby to scam them out of thousands.

Tony and Debbie Kaba were one of two couples taken in by Pollard, who faked a doctor's letter after telling them she was pregnant with their child.

Mr and Mrs Kaba told of their ordeal after Pollard was jailed for three years and four months for three counts of fraud yesterday.

Bristol Crown Court had heard how Pollard contacted the couple after hearing of their difficulty having a second child in 2012.

She convinced them to pay her £1,000 to be inseminated and another £4,000 after showing them a doctor's letter.

Mr and Mrs Kaba told The Sun that Pollard even sent them a photo of herself holding a positive pregnancy test as she bombarded them with demands for extra cash.

Mrs Kaba, 46, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, told the paper: 'She would phone us up at all hours asking for money.

'She was playing us in the most cold and calculated way. We're emotionally scarred for life. She's a she-devil.'

The couple initially agreed to keep paying Pollard, saying they desperately wanted to believe she was carrying their baby.

But after they handed over £5,000 to the fraudster, she broke off contact and they heard nothing from her.

They later contacted the doctor's surgery on Pollard's letter - who told them the document was a fake - and then went to the police.

Mrs Kaba said: 'We thought she was carrying our child and she knew how desperate we were. She destroyed that dream in the cruellest possible way.'

Pollard also lied to Josephine and Keith Barnett, who had been trying for a child for 12 years, taking more than £10,000 from them before claiming she had been involved in a serious car accident and had lost the baby.

In 2010 Pollard, of Plymouth, Devon, also alleged she was pregnant with the grandchild of Osama bin Laden, following an arrangement with his son Omar bin Laden - and again claimed she miscarried - which police also believe may have been a scam.

Detectives fear the two couples who helped bring the case to court may not be her only victims. 

Judge Graham Cottle yesterday jailed Pollard, who sobbed in the dock of Bristol Crown Court, for her 'brutal and heartless' actions.

The judge said: 'In about 2010, you achieved notoriety when agreeing to act as a surrogate mother for the son of Osama bin Laden.

'Be
 those facts as they may, what this case is about is how you agreed 
firstly to be a surrogate mother for Mr and Mrs Barnett, a childless 
couple who had been trying unsuccessfully for many years to have a 
child.

'It
 is no doubt because they were desperate and as a consequence of your 
skills as a fraudster that you quickly earned their trust then proceeded
 to practise one breathtaking deception after another and persuaded them
 to believe that you were going to provide them with what they 
desperately wanted.

Cruel: Louise Pollard, 28, from Plymouth, admitted defrauding childless couples by telling them she was pregnant and then saying she had miscarried

'It was no 
more than a tissue of lies that you told as you continued to take sums 
of money from them. For you, that was all that this was about. After 
they had parted with over £10,000 in your deception, they contacted the 
police.

'By
 that time, you had found further victims. Mr and Mrs Kaba, desperate 
for a child to be a brother or sister for their son. They too were 
completely taken into your web of deception, parting with money, being 
fobbed off with one lie after another until they ended up heartbroken 
and deprived of over £5,000.'

Judge Cottle said Pollard's actions were 'deliberate, sustained, callous acts' that had left both families devastated.

'This
 is not a case about financial loss, it is a case of two desperate 
couples being completely taken in by you and your lies,' he said.

'Of course they lost money but they have lost a great deal more than that, they have ended up heartbroken.'

In
 2010, Pollard appeared in national newspapers following her arrangement
 to carry a child for Omar bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, and 
his wife.

She had already completed two successful surrogacies but miscarried the Bin Laden pregnancy, the court heard.

Describing Pollard's other victims, prosecutor Rosaleen Collins said Josephine and Keith Barnett contacted Pollard, who was registered as a potential surrogate mother, online in 2011.

On January 26 2012, Mr and Mrs Barnett met Pollard and agreed to pay her £20,000 to carry their child.

'There followed an agonising and fairly lengthy series of events designed to milk the couple, taking advantage of their desperate wish to have a child and preying on their good nature and their emotional ties to the event itself,' Ms Collins said.

Pollard insisted she would carry out the artificial insemination herself as she did not want to undergo the procedure at a clinic.

'She did say that it was her ambition to be the most prolific surrogate mother in the country,' Ms Collins added.

Pollard said she was carrying twins for Zaina 
Bin Laden, pictured with her, left, and her then husband, Osama Bin 
Laden's son, Omar, but lost them after she was reportedly attacked while
 walking in a street in Syria

On February 
22, the Barnetts travelled to Pollard's home in Bristol and she 
disappeared into a bedroom to carry out the artificial insemination 
before being paid £1,000.

She
 announced she was pregnant on March 10 and the Barnetts paid a further 
£2,600. But weeks later, on March 31, Pollard claimed she had suffered a
 miscarriage.

Mr and Mrs Barnett continued to support her financially, paying £750 for rent and £250 for car maintenance.

'They
 were already so emotionally and financially attached to this 
arrangement that they were easily manipulated,' Ms Collins said.

According to UK law, the woman who gives birth to a child is always regarded as the legal mother at the moment of birth.

Her husband, if she has one, is regarded as the legal father, but if the surrogate mother is unmarried, the genetic father can be named on the birth certificate.

A parental order can then be applied for through the courts, which confers full parental status and responsibilities on both the intended parents.

The order is only made if at least one of the intended parents is biologically related to the child, the intended parents are in a long-term relationship and the surrogate mother and her husband agree to it.

A surrogate mother cannot be paid for her pregnancy, although the law allows her to be given 'reasonable expenses', which can reach around £10,000-£15,000.

Intended parents do not have the same rights of maternity and paternity leave as those who have children naturally, although many companies now have 'adoption leave' procedures which sometimes include rules for leave related for surrogacy.

In
 May, she pretended to artificially inseminate herself at their home and
 announced she was pregnant on May 27, extracting a further £2,700.

'All of this was a sham,' Ms Collins said.

Pollard
 continued with the faked pregnancy, demanding £150 for further car 
maintenance, £795 for rent and £2,000 for new accommodation in June.

'As
 far as they were concerned, she was pregnant with their child and they 
had to look after her and take care of her,' Ms Collins added.

On
 July 2, Mrs Barnett asked to see a photograph of Pollard's 11-week 
scan. Two days later, Pollard claimed she had been in a car crash and 
had lost the baby.

The
 Barnetts lost contact with Pollard, who ignored their requests for 
refunds, until February 2013, when she offered them another baby.

Representing Pollard, Jason Taylor said his client was 'remorseful' for her actions.

'She is clearly an intelligent woman,' Mr Taylor said. 'She is somebody who has done something she is thoroughly ashamed of. She will have to live with the consequences for the rest of her life.'

Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Mark Gilbert of Avon and Somerset Police appealed for other potential victims to come forward.

'We would like to hear from anyone who feels they have been directly affected by Louise Pollard, as we are still not sure how many couples have put their faith in her, only to be duped in similar circumstances,' he said.

The officer said Pollard acted as a surrogate to one family, providing them with two children, but the truth of her arrangement with Omar bin Laden was not known.

'We have had no lines of communication with the Bin Ladens,' Det Con Gilbert said. 'Without knowing the full circumstances, it is difficult to say but I suspect there may have been a similar situation involving them.'

He said the two couples involved in the prosecution were still suffering the impact of Pollard's deception.

'It has been an emotional rollercoaster for them,' he said. 'They are still deeply affected by the situation.'
