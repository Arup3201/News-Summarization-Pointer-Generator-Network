National Geographic have launched their 2014 annual Photo Contest, releasing a selection of entries from this year’s competition.

Some of the spectacular entries so far include images of animals, insects, people and places, and clearly live up to the organisation’s already notable reputation for ‘setting the standard for photographic excellence’.

Last year, National Geographic received over 7,000 entries from over 150 countries, with professional photographers and amateur photo enthusiasts across the globe participating in the competition.

The prestigious competition is accepting entries in three categories: people, places and nature. 

Photos submitted so far include snaps of playful polar bears in Svalbard, Norway, a flock of galahs in the Asutralian desert, a silhouette of a Mediterranean Mantis and a close-up of a manatee.

Lupine fields in California, the beauty of a glacial lagoon at sunset in Iceland and the painted faces of Mexican women celebrating The Day of the Dead complete the selection.

The Grand Prize Winner will receive $10,000 (£6,170) and a trip to National Geographic headquarters in Washington DC, to participate in the annual National Geographic Photography Seminar in January 2015.

The First Place winner in each category will each receive $2,500 (£1,540) and his or her winning photograph will be published in the National Geographic magazine.

The closing date to submit photos is 31 October.

Arctic Hi five: Colin Mackenzie snapped two polar bear cubs on an iceflow in Svalbard, Norway and said this cub in particular was entertaining to watch

This stunning image of a Mediterranean Mantis was captured by Hasan Ba Iar in Nicosia, Cyprus. He explained: 'When the Mediterranean Mantis opened its wings, It seemed very impressive at the sunshine'

A tree dreaming: Christian Spencer captured this amazing action shot in the Strezlecki desert of Australia as a flock of galahs make the most of the only water available at the base of a tree

Photographer Misty Gage said of her manatee picture: 'Capturing this gentle giant's inquisitive nature was rather easy as he swam right up to us and just stared for several long seconds. I love all the bubbles and his cute little face.' The image was taken in at the Point Defiance Zoo, Tacoma,Washington, USA

Frozen beauty: Francesco Riccardo Iacomino submitted his photo Dreamscape, showing the pinks of a perfect summer sky in Iceland reflected in the stillness of the Jokulsarlon Glacer Lagoon. He said: 'It was a typical cloudy day in the Icelandic summer. The day was not hoping for a nice sunset, but I still decided to go on the spot, hoping to finally see the sun once the same had left behind the clouds. When the sun went down, in fact the sky burned out in an incredible vanilla tone. The scene was so peaceful and placid, so I decided to capture it with a long exposure, to bring out the amazing sense of peace that this amazing sunset created. It has been like living in a dream.'

Montse Grillo entitled her photo 'From the sky', which features a close-up of a green turtle off the coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. She said: 'I find myself devoting much time to these curious creatures. . This turtle was coming from the surface with the sun behind it, and the sunrays surrounding it gave it a special majesty'

Seeing blue: Douglas Croft captured the beauty of Big Sur in California, after travelling there to watch the gray whale migration from the cliffs. He said: 'It was too foggy to even see the water. I decided to hike up the Baronda Trail to see if I could get above the fog. This view was my reward. Miles of lupine and blue skies. Outstanding!'

Painted Ladies: Daniel Kudish captured these young women in Oaxaca, Mexico, dressed up with their faces painted to celebrate the Day of the Dead (Dia de los Muertos). He said the event was 'an incredible celebration of life, and a beautiful way to remember those who have passed.'

Photographer Thomas Dorleans took this image of the Taj Mahal in Agra, India. He recalled it was shot 'in the early morning, the fog of early march spreads the light. It is like we were on drugs'

Photographer Aaron Feinberg said of this picture: 'Ah the Agave plant. Filled with amazing patterns and textures. This particular subject was a great find while visiting San Francisco. Using some fun techniques, I was able to get the light just right and the dimensionality of the plant just popped! It is definitely fun to take a moment and get intimate with nature'
