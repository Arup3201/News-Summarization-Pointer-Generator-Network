A plague of intelligent super-rats has invaded Luton town centre and have learned to avoid traps while foraging for food.

The latest super-rats, photographed by pest control expert Tony Margiocchi, avoided getting snared on the deadly trap despite nibbling on the food.

Mr Margiocchi was staking out a lane way in Luton when he spotted the first of the monster rats.

The cunning rat has learned not to put his front paws on the trap's pressure plate, allowing him to feast on tinned fish without having his neck snapped by the spring-loaded device

He said: 'I was looking to take some photographs for my new pest control business and set up on Library Road in Luton.

'It is just behind the main shopping centre and is in the middle of town. I put out a trap baited with some of John West's finest Sardines in Tomato Sauce and sat back.

'I was about 18 metres away using a 400mm lens when this massive rat appeared. He was so big I couldn't get him all in frame - even from that distance.'

According to Mr Margiocchi, he was preparing for a fairly long stakeout to get the perfect shot, but because Luton's rat problem is so severe, he was spoiled for choice.

'Rats have an excellent sense of smell and that's why I baited my trap with fish. Within minutes they arrived. I was taking photos and the flash on the camera was going off, but they had no fear. Rats used to be afraid of new things but not any longer.

'When they approached the trap, I'm certain that they knew exactly what it was. They were very careful not to put their front paws on the trap as this would release the spring. Not only do we know have super-rats, but we have intelligent super rats.'

There are an estimated 10 million rats in the UK and the population has exploded over the past several months because of the mild winter.

According to Mr Margiocchi, overflowing bins are an excellent source of food for rats allowing them to thrive

The exceptionally mild winter and a plentiful supply of food is responsible for the explosion in super-rat numbers

According to Mr Margiocchi, conditions are perfect for breeding rats.

'I don't think I can blame Luton council for the rat problem. The budget for street cleansing might be under pressure, but the council didn't dump fast food wrappers all over the place.

'We have everything we need to sustain a massive rat population. All they need is food and water. There is plenty of food dumped on the street on a nightly basis and the bins are overflowing.

'Everyone who dumps food on the street is responsible for this super-rat problem. We need to all work together to face this problem. Not dumping food is a good start but we also need to target rat populations with poison. That is the only way to keep them under control.'

Mr Margiocchi said that modern rats are far less afraid of humans and have the ability to learn

Meanwhile, several parts of the country have been plagued by infestations of super-rats.

Last week, a 2ft long rat was captured in Cornwall while other monster rats have been reported in Kent and in Liverpool.

It is feared that some of these larger rats are becoming increasingly resistant to poison and are far more difficult to kill.

One listener to the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2 tweeted a picture of a giant rat he had found

Meanwhile, in Cornwall, one Twitter user posted a photograph of a rat which was larger than a cat

Another giant rodent was discovered in Gravesend, Kent near a river and collected on a pink shovel
