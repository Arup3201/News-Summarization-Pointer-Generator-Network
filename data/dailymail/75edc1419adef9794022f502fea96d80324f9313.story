My fight with Bode: Olympic skier Bode Miller's ex-girlfriend Sara McKenna wrote an emotional essay detailing their bitter custody battle over son Sam

When Sara McKenna learned that her boyfriend Bode Miller didn't want to raise their son together, the two went their seperate ways. The Olympic skier went on to marry Volleyball player Morgan Beck and Mckenna, a former Marine, moved from her home in California to New York to continue her college education.

But just two weeks after her son Sam was born, McKenna learned that Miller had filed for custody in California and last September she temporarily lost custody of the boy who went to live with Miller.

In an essay for Cosmopolitan magazine, McKenna details the emotional turmoil she went through when she was forced to separate from Sam whom Miller and his new wife started calling 'Nathaniel'.

McKenna was working as a firefighter in San Diego when she met Miller through a matchmaker and the two started dating. 

Three months into their relationship, McKenna learned she was pregnant but when she told Miller he was less than enthused. 

'I
 told him I wanted to keep the baby. I said he could be involved if he 
wanted to and that I would love it if he did. If he didn't want any part
 of it, I said that I was going to do it on my own,' McKenna wrote in an
 essay for Cosmopolitan.

'I left in tears.'

Knowing
 that she couldn't continue to balance working as a firefighter and being a
 single mother, McKenna decided to move to New York to attend 
prestigious Columbia University on the G.I. Bill.

Plus sign: McKenna was excited when she tweeted this picture of her positive pregnancy test, but Miller ended up being less-than-enthused at the prospect of fatherhood

When McKenna found out that Miller didn't want to raise their son together she decided to move to New York to finish her education. The Olympic skier went on to marry volleyball player Morgan Beck. Pictured above after his bronze-medal win at the Sochi games

In
 addition to Columbia being a highly-competitive school, McKenna chose 
the New York City school because there were breast-feeding rooms on 
campus and family networks that would help her to raise Sam.

A month before she moved, McKenna texted Miller to let him know her plans but she says he never responded.

She was seven-months-pregnant when she arrived in New York and took up her studies one month later.

Son
 Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna was born on February 23, 2013 and she filed for 
temporary custody of the child three days later.

But
 when Sam was just two weeks old, McKenna learned that her ex-boyfriend 
and filed for custody of the child despite never expressing any interest
 in being the boy's father. Miller and wife Morgan had also experienced a
 miscarriage that January.

Chang of heart: When Sam was just two weeks old, McKenna found out that Miller filed for custody of their son in California - sending the papers to her San Diego address where she was no longer living. Father and son pictured together in a shot on Morgan Miller's Instagram

Separated: In September, McKenna lost custody of Sam to Miller and the boy went to live with his skier dad and step-mom in California. Sam and step-mom pictured above

Miller
 sent the custody papers to her home in San Diego, despite knowing she 
didn't live there, and that set off a complex multi-state custody 
battle.

Eventually
 the case was sent back to California and on September 4, a judge gave
 Miller full-custody of Sam calling McKenna's move to New York 
'irresponsible' and 'irreprehensible'.

After losing Sam, McKenna's life turned into a 'nightmare' and she quit school and her job.

But
 she soon realized that being 'catatonic wasn't helping matters'. And 
she re-enrolled and continued her studies while relentlessly pursuing a 
way to get Sam back for good.

All
 the while McKenna tracked her son's life with Miller on her ex and his 
new wife's social media profiles and noticed they were calling him 
'Nathaniel'.

'I
 would look for photos of Sam on Instagram and Twitter and saw that Bode
 was calling him Nathaniel. That was really heartbreaking. Our son’s 
name is Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna. Calling him anything else is just 
confusing.

'There were also tons of photos of Bode’s wife holding Sam like he was her baby. That was very hard to bear,' McKenna added.

New name: Miller and his new wife Morgan started calling Sam 'Nathaniel' as evidenced by the baby shower pictures Mrs Miller posted on her Instagram

The next time McKenna saw her son was at a court hearing on November 25 where she won back custody of Sam.

'I
 was sitting in court when I heard Sam’s sweet little voice down the 
hall. As soon as I saw him, I reached out and said, “I missed you!” He 
put his arms out for me and said, “Mama!” We still had to deal with a 
court hearing that day, but I didn’t care. I could breathe again. I was 
whole. The next day was my birthday. I woke up next to Sam, and he 
started giggling — that was the best present I’ve ever received in my 
life,' she said.

McKenna is back living in New York and hopes to work out stable life for Sam where he can see both of his parents.

'That's all I want for our son,' she wrote.

The
 experience of losing her son has also inspired her studies as she is 
now pursuing a law degree to help others in her position.
