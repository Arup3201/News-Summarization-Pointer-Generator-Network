Fox News host Sean Hannity unbuckled his belt and whacked it Monday night, while demonstrating how he was beaten as a child and defending Minnesota Vikings player Adrian Peterson.

Hannity made the remarks while speaking to a panel on his program 'Hannity', which consisted of Mike Bako, Robi Ludwig, and Mercedes Colwin, Mediaite pointed out.

Peterson, a star in the NFL, is accused of beating two of his children.

'I got hit with a strap, bam, bam, bam, and I've never been to a shrink, by my father,' Hannity said while starting the discussion. 'I would tell you I deserved it. I think he went too far, but I don't want to see this guy get a felony, I don't want to see this guy lose his job, I don't want to see this guy - he deserves parenting classes.'

Defense: While thumping his belt, Fox News anchor Sean Hannity said he 'got it like this' from his father 

Afte Ludwig, a psychotherapist, said Peterson's alleged child abuse 'took it to an extreme,' Hannity interrupted and said 'I had welts when my father hit me with his belt. Come on.'

When Ludwig continued, remarking that 'Corporal punishment doesn't work,' Hannity responded 'I don't hit my kids. I don't have to. I take their iPhone away. It works perfectly.'

After Colwin, a legal analyst, described the wounds Peterson's children suffered as a result of his alleged abuse, Hannity responded 'But all the people that have used switches over the years, and used belts, what are we going to do: arrest them all? We gonna arrest everybody that's ever hit their kid?'

'But it's a changing time,' journalist Bako said, asking if Hannity's father put leaves in his mouth, in a manner similar to Peterson's alleged abuse.

Interrupting Bako, Hannity said 'My father punched me in the face when I talked back to him once, and I deserved it.'

Corporal punishment: Hannity, who also snapped his belt on the program,  said he 'deserved' his punishment from his father and 'was a troubled kid' 

When Ludwig spoke about between spanking, child abuse and corporal punishment, Hannity unbuckled his belt from his trousers.

'I got it like this!,' he said, while whacking his belt on the table three tames. 'And I deserved it. I was a troubled kid.'

'We know better,' Ludwig said, while Colwin talked about how felony child abuse charges may be brought against a parent.

As Colwin spoke, Hannity repeatedly snapped his belt.

'So a switch is always wrong in your view?' he asked after she finished speaking.

'Yes,' Colwin said.

'You should arrest every parent that uses a switch?'

When Colwin and Ludwig spoke over one another, Hannity asked 'So my father should have been arrested, based on today's standards?'

'Maybe,' Ludwig said, while Colwin replied 'Yes.'

'That's nuts,' Hannity said.

'He went too far,' Hannity said at a later point in the program. 'Don't put this guy in jail, ruin his career. Give him Robbie Ludwig classes.'

When Colwin and Ludwig spoke over one criticized Hannity's remarks, Hannity said 'I will tell you, I was not mentally bruised my father hit me with a belt.'

Odd man out: Hannity's remarks contrasted sharply with those of panelists (from left to right) Mike Bako, Dr. Robi Ludwig and Mercedes Colwin
