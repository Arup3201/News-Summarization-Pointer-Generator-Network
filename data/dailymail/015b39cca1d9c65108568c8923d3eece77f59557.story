Hillary Clinton has compared Vladimir Putin's decision to have Russian troops invade Crimea to a tactic used by the Nazis in the lead up to the second World War.

The former Secretary of State said that by using the guise of protecting the minority of native Russians living in the Ukraine, Putin has taken an approach that was used by Adolf Hitler in order to help him encroach on neighboring countries.

'Now if this sounds familiar, it’s what Hitler did back in the 30s,' Clinton said at an event in Long Beach, California on Tuesday.

Looking back: Hillary Clinton said that Putin's tactics in saying that he is protecting the Russian minority in the Ukraine are similar to those used by Hitler when he began to annex neighboring countries in Europe

'All the Germans that were ... the ethnic Germans, the Germans by ancestry who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places, Hitler kept saying they’re not being treated right. "I must go and protect my people" and that’s what’s gotten everybody so nervous.'

Hitler's policy was called 'Heim ins Reich', or 'Home into the Empire', and led to the Nazis annexing portions of Austria, Poland and Czechoslovakia to be 'returned' to Germany after their troops were granted entrance to the areas under the guise of helping German nationals in the outside territories.

In a similar vein, Putin recently issued Russian passports to any Ukrainians with ties to Russia, which many saw as a way to lay his claims for entry.

'Putin is trying to assert his power in a way that is dangerous,' Clinton said.

According to Fox News, she went on to say that Putin is a person 'who believes his mission is to restore Russian greatness... When he looks at Ukraine, he sees a place that he believes is by its very nature part of Mother Russia.'

Plan of attack: President Vladimir Putin has issued Russian passports to any people with Russian descent who live in the Ukraine so he has justification to enter the country to 'protect' Russian citizens

In shambles: The political situation in the Ukraine remains uncertain and a memorial has been set up where nearly 100 anti government protesters were killed in Kiev's Independence Square

This is not the first time that Mrs Clinton has blasted the Russian leader.

Politico reported she jokingly said during the 2008 presidential campaign that 'he was a KGB agent. By definition, he doesn't have a soul'.

Tuesday's talk was just the latest paid speech that the former Secretary of State has made in recent weeks, this time speaking at a private event held at the Long Beach Boys and Girls Club.

Her comments were not released publicly but an audience member told Buzzfeed that she praised the work of her successor, John Kerry, who arrived in Kiev on Tuesday to help assess the ongoing crisis.

Kerry's trip coincided with Washington's approval of a $1billion aid package to the Ukraine, which came ahead of the European Union's own package of $15billion.

He has since traveled to Paris and is scheduled to speak with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

She went on to say that the situation in Crimea is 'a real nail-biter, right now, but nobody wants to up the rhetoric. Everybody wants to cool it in order to find a diplomatic solution and that’s what we should be trying to do.'
