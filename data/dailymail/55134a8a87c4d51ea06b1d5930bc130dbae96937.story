Three former NFL players have been diagnosed with having signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), including former Dallas Cowboys great and football Hall of Famer Tony Dorsett, 59.

Up until recently, the only way to diagnose CTE was by studying brain tissue after death, but a UCLA research team has pioneered a brain-imaging technique that identifies a build-up of abnormal proteins called tau in the brain.

The other players diagnosed were 
Hall of Fame offensive lineman Joe DeLamielleure, 62, and former All-Pro 
defensive lineman Leonard Marshall, 52. One other unidentified player was 
also tested but his results are not yet known.

Recently diagnosed: Tony Dorsett has undergone three months of testing that confirmed the presence in his brain of a kind of protein linked to a degenerative disorder

The presence of tau in the amygdala and subcortical regions of the brain is believed to be triggered by trauma from repeated blows to the head.

These regions control learning, memory, behavior, emotions, and other mental and physical functions.

The players underwent three months of testing. Five other players were tested last year; all were confirmed to have signs of CTE.

The condition is found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma such as boxers, and is increasingly being associated with NFL players.

A build-up of tau protein in the brain strangles brain cells and causes the brain to degenerate, resulting in memory loss, confusion, impaired judgement, impulse control problems, aggression, depression and progressive dementia.

Dorsett played 12 years in the NFL, 11 of those for the Dallas Cowboys and recorded 12,739 rushing yards and 77 touchdowns.

He told ESPN's Outside the Lines that
 he has suffered memory loss, getting lost while driving his young 
daughters places he's been going every week for years.

He experiences mood swings, lashing out at his family uncharacteristically.

'It's painful, man, for my daughters to say they're scared of me.' After a long pause, he tearfully reiterated, 'It's painful.'

Dorsett has also been diagnosed with depression and had suicidal thoughts.

As of December last year, 33 NFL players have been diagnosed with CTE postmortem, among them at least four of them died by suicide.

'My quality of living has changed drastically and it deteriorates every day,' said Dorsett.

'I've thought about crazy stuff, sort of
 like, "Why do I need to continue going through this?"' he said. 'I'm 
too smart of a person, I like to think, to take my life, but it's 
crossed my mind.'

DeLamielleure, 62, told Outside the Lines that he's sure his condition was caused by his football career.

'I can guarantee you my CTE, my tau, came from hits, came from blows to the head,' he said.

He suffers anxiety, insomnia, mood swings and has had suicidal thoughts.

During his 13-year career playing for Buffalo and Cleveland, he was never diagnosed with a concussion but estimates he had at least 100 concussions out of thousands of blows to the head during games and practice.

The NFL has repeatedly denied there is enough evidence to conclude there is a link between football and CTE, but in light of recent diagnoses has shifted its position on head injuries, introducing rule changes and promoting education.

'I knew something was going on. It takes me back to the fact that we [as players] were treated [after head injuries] and still put back out there in harm’s way, when from my understanding management knew what they were doing to us.

'They were still subjecting us to that kind of physical abuse without the proper treatment. It really hurts... But I'm determined to beat this,' Dorsett told the Dallas News.

In January, Dr. Richard Ellenbogen, a Seattle neurosurgeon and co-chair of the NFL's Head, Neck and Spine Committee, told Outside the Lines that the UCLA CTE study was 'promising work,' adding the researchers were 'honest about the limitations as well as being excited about the findings.'

Dorsett, Marshall and DeLamielleure are among the more than 4,500 plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit filed against the NFL, which argued that for years the NFL had concealed a link between football and brain damage.

In August, they settled for $765 million but as part of the settlement, the NFL did not admit to any wrongdoing. 

Neurosurgeon Julian Bailes, part of the UCLA research team told ESPN, 'Until we had the ability to see it in a living, breathing person, we had no chance of helping them, we had no chance of really understanding what happens to the disease. It gives us the ability to track it, to see if it gets worse, or hopefully, maybe it gets better with medication, with intervention, with new discoveries.'

Dorsett is hopeful about the future now that he has received a diagnosis for his troubling symptoms

'I'm trying to slow this down or cut it off,' he said. 'I'm going to be 60 years old here next year, so I'm hoping that I've got another good 30 years or so.'
