Kenneth Bae arrived home after years of imprisonment in North Korea, expressing his gratitude to the U.S. government for securing his release and revealing that his time there offered lessons.

And his sister said he had one stipulation for his first meal back home: No Korean food.

'He said, "I don't want Korean food, that's all I've been eating for the last two years,"' Terri Chung said Sunday outside her Seattle church. 'We had a late night eating pizza.'  

Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller were freed from the reclusive communist state on Saturday following a secret mission by the top U.S. intelligence official. 

Last night, the pair landed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state about midnight ET (9pm local time).

Family: Terri Chung, sister of Kenneth Bae, answered questions from the media after attending Sunday service at Quest Church in Interbay, Washington state

According to Business Insider, Chung said on Sunday that her brother said 'That’s all I’ve been eating for the last two years. He said, "I want a burger or pizza or something." So we saw that Papa John’s was open around the corner.' 

Chung also said that her brother was staying with family members, and enjoyed visiting with his loved ones upon his return.

'He was cut off from all of that for two years,' she said. 'His only contacts were his guard, and maybe doctors and a handful of times the Swedish embassy.'

Chung said she was thrilled to have her brother home, and that 'he bears no ill will' over his ordeal.

Although he still has warm feelings for the North Korean people, Chung doubted her brother would want to return to that country any time soon.

He hasn't told them many details about his ordeal and Chung said she remains worried about her brother.

The State Department called the family at about 2 a.m. Saturday to give them the news that Bae was coming home. They also received a call a few days earlier saying something might be happening, but Chung was reluctant to believe that message.

'There's been a lot of heartbreak and disappointment,' she said of the years of waiting for her brother's release.

She thanked people around the world for their prayers and government officials and others for advocating for Bae's release. She also said former detainees and their families have been a source of comfort and support for her family.

'First and foremost we thank God,' Chung said, adding soon afterward, 'I have to thank President Obama.'

Bae, who was jailed in 2012 for alleged anti-government activities, was the first to step off the plane emblazoned with stars and stripes and onto the tarmac Saturday night into the arms of his family members.

The Korean-American missionary from Lynnwood, Washington, laughed and beamed as he hugged his mother who ran over to him. 

He was followed by California-born Miller, 24, who was serving a six-year jail term on charges of espionage, after he allegedly ripped his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport in April and demanded asylum.

With a shaved head, Miller looked happy but subdued as he walked down the steps and into his beaming mother's arms.

His father wrapped an arm over his shoulder and took one of Miller's two small bags to carry. 

North Korea said Miller had wanted to experience prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea's human rights situation. 

While Miller went home with his family, Bae and his sister Terri Chung address a press conference.

'I've grown': Bae told reporters he has learned a lot in his two years of hard labor at his private prison

Bae's family have thanked President Obama for not abandoning their relative

Bae thanked President Barack Obama and the many people who supported him on Saturday night. He also thanked the North Korean government for releasing him, and said 'it's been an amazing two years, I learned a lot.' 

He started his speech by saying: 'I just want to say thank you all for supporting me and standing by me in this time and it's been just [an] amazing blessing to see so many people being involved getting me released in the last two years - not to mention the thousands of people praying for me.

'I just want to thank you for lifting me up and not forgetting me, not forgetting the people of North Korea as well.'

'This has been a tremendously difficult time for my family.

'I just want to thank President Obama and the state departments working tirelessly to bring me home, and North Korea.

'It's been an amazing two years. I learned a lot, I grew a lot lost, a lot of weight - in a good way - and I'm standing strong.' 

'It's been an amazing two years, I learned a lot': Bae said he still loves North Korea, where he was a tour guide

Thank you: He thanked President Obama and North Korea for having mercy and letting him go

Obama tabled the mission last week and it was approved by Congress, which sent intelligence official James Clapper to North Korea with a presidential letter. 

Bae and Miller were the last US nationals held by the dictatorship following the release last month of Jeffrey Fowle, an Ohio resident detained for nearly six months.  

The announcement about Bae and Miller came one day before Obama travels to Asia for a three-country visit. 

Kim Jong-un released the prisoners this week from their respective labor camps in the reclusive state

Bizarre: Former NBA All Star Dennis Rodman, a friend of Kim's, as claimed he was behind Bae's release

He said today that it was a 'wonderful day for them and their families' and was 'grateful' the pair had been returned. 

Dennis Rodman has claimed that he was behind Bae's release.

The former basketball star wrote to his 'friend for life' Kim Jong-Un and begged him for mercy. 

In a letter sent to the communist dictator earlier this year that was shown to TMZ, Rodman wrote: '[I] would be eternally grateful for his safe return and make a big step towards bridging the gap between our two nations.'

He also compliments the leader's progress, such as the construction of new water parks and airport terminals, in his 'beautiful country' and thanked him for a special stay.
