Sell-off: Rescue helicopter services, such as those flown by Prince William, will now be operated by a private American company

A U.S. firm was today handed the contract for Britain’s helicopter search and rescue operations.

The award of the £1.6billion contract to Texas-based Bristow Group marks the end of 70 years of search and rescue operations by the Royal Navy, the RAF and the Maritime & Coastguard Agency.

Armed forces pilots such as Prince William, who works at the RAF search and rescue base on Anglesey, will be replaced by civilian contractors over the next few years.

The deal, which runs from 2015 to 2026, will also mean the end of the much-loved Sea King helicopter, famous for its yellow RAF or red Navy coat.

As well as its emergency role, the Sea King was used in a combat capacity during the Falklands conflict. Bristow is planning to replace it with the faster Sikorsky S-92 and Somerset-built AgustaWestland 189.

The Government has been trying to offload the rescue operation in a time of cost-cutting at home and extensive military operations abroad.

The deal means a reduction from 12 to ten search and rescue bases, with an end to operations at RAF Boulmer in Northumberland and Portland coastguard centre in Dorset.

The Government believes the ten surviving bases will be able to cover much larger areas with faster helicopters.

Bristow, the Texan firm that won the contract, will use the Sikorsky S-92 helicopter, which it already uses to transport offshore oil workers in the UK

The Sea King helicopter has been an iconic sight over British seas for nearly four decades - whether emblazoned in RAF yellow or the red of the Royal Navy.

The search and rescue vehicles first entered military service in 1977 and were built by Westland Helicopters, adapted from the Sikorsky S-61.

It is well adapted for search missions as it can hold up to 19 passengers as well as the crew.The Sea King's Rolls-Royce H1400-1 Gnome engines give it a top speed of 143mph.

The vehicle is nearly 56ft long, with rotors of 62ft.

Of the many RAF pilots to have operated the Sea King, the best-known is Prince William, who has been flying rescue missions since October 2010 - following in the footsteps of his uncle, the Duke of York.

Bristow,
which has operated for more than 50 years, already provides transport 
services in the UK to ferry oil-rig workers to and from North Sea 
platforms.

Its success is 
at the expense of UK firm Bond Aviation, which was also in the running 
for the contract. Trade unions have argued a commercial operator with 
civilian staff will not be able to match the specialist skills of 
military crew.

A previous attempt to offload the service to the private sector collapsed in 2011 when Canada’s CHC Helicopter – the preferred bidder – revealed that a former Whitehall insider had given it ‘commercially sensitive information’.

CHC was eliminated from the running in January after it was underbid by the other two firms.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: 'Our SAR helicopter service plays a crucial role, saving lives and providing assistance to people in distress on both land and on sea.

'With 24 years of experience providing SAR helicopter services in the UK, the public can have great confidence in Bristow and their ability to deliver a first-class service with state-of-the-art helicopters.'

Officials claim that the deal will allow search and rescue helicopters to reach 85 per cent of accident hotspots within 30 minutes, up from 70 per cent currently.

Bristow Helicopters was founded in Aberdeen in 1953, and was taken over in 1996 by the American firm Offshore Logistics, which subsequently rebranded itself as Bristow Group.
