Matthew Matagrano: The 36-year-old has a lengthy rap sheet that includes a conviction for sodomy. He was jailed today for ten years

A convicted sex offender who repeatedly used phony correction department credentials to gain entry into New York City jails has been sentenced to ten years in prison.

Matthew Matagrano was sentenced on Thursday.

The 36-year-old Yonkers resident pleaded guilty last month to posing as a correction officer and sneaking into the Manhattan Detention Center, where he mingled with inmates for hours.

During a February 27 visit, Matagrano assaulted and strip-searched an inmate and stole a $2,500 walkie-talkie from Riker's Island.

He also handed out cigarettes to inmates.

Matagrano's rap sheet includes a conviction for sodomy and sexual abuse.

Matagrano said he repeatedly sneaked into jails because the people inside were 'nice' and made him 'feel important', according to a court report.

During the February visit, Matagrano impersonated a staff member by flashing a fake gold badge.

He then pinned an inmate up against a wall, grabbed his testicles and then ordered him into a cell where he made him remove all his clothes.

Matagrano was already facing impersonation charges after blagging his way into the detention center where he spent seven-and-a-half hours with prisoners.

After he was exposed, Matagrano admitted his brazen sneaking, but revealed his unusual admiration for correction workers.

'They give me food. They made me feel important,' said 5ft 8in, 340lb Matagrano.

Security breach: Most people who've done time on Rikers Island can't wait to get away. Officials say that for at least a week, Matthew Matagrano used a badge and ID card to get into Rikers and roam the jail in February

Norman Seabrook, Correction union president, told the Daily News at the time: 'We’re talking about a serious breach of security.'

His break into jail was not the first time Matagrano has been caught impersonating staff with fake credentials.

In
2004 he flashed a Board of Education ID to sneak into an elementary 
school and look through student files. On that occasion he went to jail 
for three years.

His 
criminal history also includes another year behind bars for sodomizing a
15-year-old boy which lead to him registering as a sex offender for life.

Security breach: It's not clear why Matagrano wanted to get into the jail, but he had also previously been caught posing as a Board of Education worker to enter schools
