Azhar Ahmed, 19, arrives at court today accused of making 'grossly offensive' comments about dead British troops

A teenager today denied posting a grossly offensive message on Facebook about the deaths of six British soldiers in Afghanistan.

Azhar Ahmed, 19, appeared at court charged under the Communications Act 2003 with sending a message that was grossly offensive on March 8.

A racially-aggravated public order charge was withdrawn at today’s hearing and Ahmed denied the new charge that was put to him.

Ahmed, from Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, was bailed and will stand trial at Huddersfield Magistrates’ Court on July 3. He has been bailed to an address not given to court.

There was a large police presence outside Dewsbury Magistrates’ Court for the hearing today as around 50 far-right protesters staged a noisy demonstration when the defendant arrived and left.

A police spokesman said last week that Ahmed, from Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, was commenting on the level of attention British soldiers who died in a bomb blast last week received compared to Afghan civilians who have died in the war.

The spokesman said: 'He didn’t make his point very well and that is why he has landed himself in bother.'

The six soldiers were killed by an improvised explosive device in Lashkar Gah on March 6 in the deadliest single attack on British forces in Afghanistan since 2001.

The explosion happened on a routine night patrol on the borders of Helmand and Kandahar provinces.

They died in a catastrophic double blast when the huge bomb triggered a second explosion of ammunition inside their Warrior armoured vehicle.

It reduced the 40-ton Warrior to a ‘riddled shell’, meaning it was impossible for any of its occupants to survive.Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st 
Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment was killed alongside Corporal
Jake Hartley, 20.

Fellow troops Private Anthony Frampton, 20, Private Christopher 
Kershaw, 19, Private Daniel Wade, 20, and Private Daniel Wilford, 21, 
all of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, were also killed.

Ahmed’s court appearance coincided with 
the repatriation of the soldiers’ bodies, which are being flown to RAF 
Brize Norton in Oxforshire later today.

The tragedy was the biggest single 
loss of life for British forces in Afghanistan since an RAF Nimrod crash
killed 14 people in September 2006.

It took the number of UK troops who have died since the Afghanistan campaign began in 2001 to 404.

The commanding officer of the unit hit hardest by the Afghanistan blast paid a moving tribute to the men earlier this month.

Lt Colonel Zac Stenning, of 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, read a eulogy to the troops outside Battlesbury Barracks in Warminster, Wiltshire.

He said: 'Six of our brothers have fallen. It has been a sad day.'

The ultimate sacrifice: The six soldiers pictured were killed in Afghanistan when their vehicle struck an improvised explosive device. They have an average age of just 22
