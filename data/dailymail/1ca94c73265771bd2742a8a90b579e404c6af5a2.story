In four minutes of playing time against Aston Villa, Andy Carroll contributed more to the excitement of a goalless draw than almost anyone else.

It took roughly the same amount of time for Sam Allardyce to explain he will take personal responsibility if this comeback is rushed and ends in yet more pain for the striker.

It’s been easy to forget over the five months since Carroll  tore ligaments in his left ankle — and West Ham found an exciting attack pair in his absence — that he can cause mayhem with correct service.

Stewart Downing provided that on Saturday as Carroll made his first appearance since a pre-season tour of New Zealand ended with a flight to the US for surgery. His cameo was brief but dramatic as he dominated Villa in the air. 

A draw breaks Villa’s streak of six defeats, yielding their first point since September 13.

The challenge now will be his slow reintegration, with Allardyce estimating it could be as many as six games before the 25-year-old is fully fit.

‘Andy is five or six games away from being fit,’ Allardyce said. ‘He is in the (equivalent of) first throes of pre-season.

‘It will take strength of mind as we must not think he is ready now, which he will do because all players do.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce will not be rushing Carroll back after a quicker than expected recovery

'It is me having a firm sense of mind by saying, “You are in pre-season, if I bring you on any quicker and you get injured again then that will be my fault”.

‘I am not willing to do that because the squad we have is working fantastically well.’

Allardyce provided a compelling insight into the battle Carroll has endured since suffering his second major injury in just 18 months.

He said: ‘I remember him in New Zealand, really distressed, and then flying to Boston to get the repair.

‘That decision was made swiftly so Andy had the op in a few days and he is probably back sooner than expected.
