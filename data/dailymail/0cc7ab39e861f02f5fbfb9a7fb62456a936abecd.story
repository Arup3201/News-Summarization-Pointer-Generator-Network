A single mother has described the moment when a stranger in a ski mask almost blinded her by throwing a cup of acid over her face.

Alison Novick, 46, of Northfield, Michigan, suffered the attack at home in front of her daughter and admitted she thought she would die.

She will need an eye transplant after her right cornea was completely burned and doctors said it was the worst eye injury they had ever seen.

Horror: Alison Novick, 46, of Northfield, Michigan, suffered the attack at home in front of her daughter and admitted she thought she would die

‘I thought he was going to kill me,’ she told Fox affiliate WJBK. ‘I can honestly say I never had that feeling go through my mind.

‘All I could think of was I'm going to die right here,' Ms Novick added. 'How could someone do this in front of a kid? I just don't understand it.’

Police are still hunting her attacker, whom Ms Novick claims ran up to her and threw a full cup of acid over her face without saying a word.

A recording was released of her daughter telling a 911 dispatcher ‘someone just dumped something on my mom’ and ‘she can't see’.

She described the taste as ‘bitter’. Police believe the suspect was hiding nearby and ran off after the attack before disappearing, reported WJBK.

Doctors at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor described it as ‘the worse eye injury they had seen’, she said.

Once police have found who attacked the mother of two he could be jailed for at least ten years for assault, reported WJBK.

‘I don't know why you would do something like this,’ Ms Novick told WJBK. ‘My kids' lives, my life is now turned upside down.’
