These pictures show the horrific injuries inflicted on Alfie, a Kelpie-Labrador cross, who was abducted from his home and severely abused and nearly died. 

The life of the Melbourne pooch was hanging on by a thread when he was found outside his Sunshine home on Friday after disappearing 24 hours earlier. 

Three-year-old Alfie had serious dog bites all over his body, a rope around his back leg, chain marks around his neck and an 8cm deep stab wound to his neck.

Alfie, a Kelpie-Labrador cross, was abducted from his owner's backyard in Melbourne last Thursday 

His owners believe he was taken by a dog fighting gang and he suffered 20 wounds across his body to his neck, throat, ribs and shoulders

Alfie's owner Sheena believes he was the victim of a criminal dog fighting ring and he was taken to Advanced Vetcare in Kensington where he needed 100 stitches and two plasma transfusion. 

Sheena described the dog snatch from her Fraser Street backyard as 'brazen'. 

She told 3AW radio: 'Broad daylight, quiet suburban street, there are kids playing in the street (when) someone took him.

'We thought our backyard was secure. We know now that it wasn't.

'Someone simply opened the gate, walked in, took the lead, and that was it.' 

Sheena described finding Alfie outside her home on Friday and told 7News: 'He had clearly walked a very long way, he was dehydrated and was in complete shock.

'I find it unbelievable he came home, he should be dead.' 

After spending the weekend at the vets Alfie is now home and recovering from the ordeal. 

He had a total of 20 wounds and they were contaminated with dirt and gravel, he escaped injury to any vital organs.

Police are investigating the abduction and the RSPCA have branded the act as 'disgusting' 

Sheena added: 'He's starting to eat a little bit and he's looking a little bit perkier, which is fantastic," 

He was released on Sunday night after being cared for by vet Dr Sarah Triglia who believes he could have been attacked by one dog or more. 

A spokesman for RSPCA Victoria told Daily Mail Australia: 'We have not received an official complaint about this yet but we are very concerned, especially about the knife wounds. 

'We don't condone acts of cruelty and the investigation is still in its early stages. 

'We were shocked to hear the news, and we don't want to try and speculate as to what happened. 

'A dog fighting gang is one of he possible scenarios, it is disgusting, this sort of thing is going on all over Australia and we work very closely with the police on issues like this. 

Alfie is now back at home and on the road to recovery after his 24 ordeal 

'It is hard to find evidence on any dog fighting rings, it is such an underground activity often linked with crime.' 

Victoria Police are investigating and say an unknown woman was seen leaving the home on Thursday afternoon and getting into a car. 

She is described as having a thin build and is between 25-35 years of age.

The car is described as a dark coloured older model Holden Commodore sedan with distinctive wheel rims, driven by a man perceived to have olive coloured skin.
