How do you eat yours? Wolf it down, spoon out the inside? Or simply tuck in using a pair of chopsticks?

A Chinese takeaway in London is offering its customers a rather unique take on Cadbury's Creme Egg in the form of a deep fried wonton.

Jeremy Pang, head chef at North London takeaway Zing Zing created the unique treat by deep frying the Creme Egg in wonton batter, creating a crunchy dumpling with a soft gooey centre.

A North London takeaway, Zing Zing, is offering its customers the chance to try a Creme Egg wonton this Easter

The takeaway had a hit with an earlier wonton filled with Nutella and banana and are hoping that the £1 Creme Egg wonton will be equally popular.

Restaurant boss Mark Schlagman says that their latest offering fits in with the restaurant's bid to offer an alternative to your average Chinese takeaway.

'We are trying to be a different kind of Chinese food delivery service, so we never use additives or MSG in our food.

Restaurant boss Mark Schlagman, says the concoction is truly delicious

The wonton is prepared in a very similar way to a traditional dumpling

'The idea of deep frying a Creme Egg is nothing new, but we think we're the first to put it in a wonton wrapper.'

He continued to say that the egg was extremely tasty and not just an Easter gimmick.

'It tastes absolutely delicious and is best eaten with chopsticks, although I probably wouldn't recommend dipping it in soy sauce.'

The wontons cost £1 each and contain around 300 calories

At an estimated 300 calories the novelty racks up almost double the calories of an average Creme Egg, and certainly isn't as light as a traditional wonton, at around 50 calories.

The wonton is the latest Creme Egg recipe to join the list of Easter snack oddities on offer.

Graham Eyes, a butcher from Southport, Merseyside, created Scotch Creme Eggs in a bid to entice more customers through the doors of his shop.

The 53-year-old is renowned locally for his unusual concoctions and, after the success of last year's Cadbury's Mini Egg sausages, he was looking for another way to brighten up Easter.

His latest offering is a Cadbury's Creme Egg wrapped in sausage meat and flavoured with a variety of seasonings.

Mr Eyes, who opened his first butcher shop more than 30 years ago, said: 'So far I have had mixed reactions from people about the Scotch Creme Eggs.

'Some of my customers can't wait to try them but other people think they just sound disgusting.

Graham says that he thinks the Scotch Creme Eggs are really tasty

'Personally I think they are really tasty, I really like them. They've got a really interesting taste.

'You've got the sweetness from the chocolate, contrasting with the chilli and lime that we use in the coating - but the flavours go really well together.'

Graham has even considered those on a diet, and there is an offering without any breadcrumbs for slimmers.

Create your own sweet Creme Egg pizza

INGREDIENTS: For the base: 375g flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon caster sugar, 1  x  7g sachet of instant yeast, 2 tablespoons sunflower oil and 225ml warm water. For the topping: Half a jar of strawberry jam, 100g white chocolate, a small handful of mint leaves and a Creme Egg.

HOW TO DO IT: Lightly grease a flat baking sheet. Combine the flour, salt, sugar and yeast in a large bowl before adding the oil and water and mixing to a smooth, pliable dough.

Roll the base out into a thin circle and place on the baking sheet. Cook in a preheated oven at 200c for 20-25 minutes, then remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.

Top the cooled base with jam, and grate white chocolate over the top using the coarse side of the grater so it looks like cheese, then finish with scattered mint leaves.

Halve the Creme Egg and carefully scoop out the fondant, placing it on the pizza so it looks like a baked egg, with the yolk in the middle of the white. Grate some of the egg’s chocolate shell on to look like black pepper.
