When it comes to the NYPD, no job is too big or too small.

From catching crooks to cats stuck up trees, New York's Finest can handle it all - usually.

One cat-capturing-cop responding to a 911 call found himself needing the emergency services too.

After school drama: The double cat and cop rescue took place after school outside Public School 213 in Queens, New York

The officer was trying to rescue a stray that had become stranded in a tree in Oakland Park, Queens.

After climbing one branch too many, he ended up having to make his own 911 call, this time to the fire department.

The officer found himself stuck up the same tree as the cat, just a little further down.

The cop was trying to rescue the kitty across the street from Public School 213.

Children at the school made their wishes known to the officer, 'You gotta get the cat! You gotta get the cat!' they begged.

'The cop went up after the cat. The cat went a little further out. So, the cop went further out and he got stuck.' said a source at the NYPD.

Leave it to New York's Bravest who arrived with the tools that this job needed from the get-go.

An FDNY tower ladder and bucket arrived to scoop up the cop and cat 30 feet up the tree and brought them both back down to earth, without so much as a scratch.

The black and white cat appeared to be about a year old and was not wearing a collar, according to neighbour Luna Giuong, 19.

Another neighbour Jeff Yu, 22, said students from the nearby school had just finished classes for the day and stopped to stare at the police officer and the cat.

'It was kind of comical,' he said. 'They seemed to be enjoying themselves. There were no rude comments or anything.'

The officer had lit a flare and set up cones on the ground underneath the tree before going up but onlookers ignored them as they gathered and gawked from the ground, said Yu.

No doubt the officer involved will be preparing to face some ribbing from his colleagues back at the station house - perhaps a job at 'special branch' awaits?
