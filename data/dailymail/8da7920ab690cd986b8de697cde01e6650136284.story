Terry Fearns was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison but is allowed out on day-release each week to play football for Skelmersdale United

A non-league footballer jailed for his role in a cross-border drugs operation is being freed from prison on day-release to play football.

Police found £30,000 of heroin destined for the streets of Merseyside and Scotland when they raided Terry Fearns' Maghull home in 2009. 

Sentenced last year to four years and eight months in HMP Kirkham, an open prison near Preston, the former Southport FC striker is being let out each week to turn out for Skelmersdale United. 

The 33-year-old, who pleaded guilty to supplying Class A drugs, cut and packaged the heroin for sale as part of a 12-strong drugs gang. 

Yet despite serving less than half of his sentence Fearns, who was also a builder before he was jailed, has taken advantage of a scheme to re-integrate offenders into society. 

Fearns, who also played for Wigan Athletic's youth team, is due to be freed next September.

Paul Griffiths, chairman of Skelmersdale United FC, defended the decision to sign Fearns, who scored on his Skelmersdale debut.

He said: 'He [Fearns] is a guy who deserves a second chance and if the Home Office and Prison Service are happy to give him a second chance then we are OK to give the lad a second chance.'

Fearns is set to be released from HMP Kirkham next September

Skelmersdale United manager Tommy Lawson refused to comment.

The decision was questioned by a Sefton councillor concerned over the message it would send to the club's young fans. 

Ainsdale councillor Terry Jones said: 'Footballers are role models and people look up to people like this. 

'When you make a mistake in life you have to pay for it but when people are looking up to you it's different.

'Football clubs look at things the wrong way and they shouldn't look at what the footballers are doing but what the kids of the future may take from it.'

A spokeswoman for Merseyside Probation Trust said offenders can be granted temporary release at the request of their prison governor based on their progress.

She said: 'It's part of their rehabilitation process and it is about getting them back into the community.'

In December Fearns was ordered to hand over almost £7,500 of his ill-gotten gains.
