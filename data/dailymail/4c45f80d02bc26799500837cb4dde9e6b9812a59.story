A mother has warned parents about the dangers of Nurofen for Children after it triggered kidney failure in her 12 year-old son.

Louize Carroll, 39, treated her son Josh with the recommended dose of liquid ibuprofen when he complained of a sore throat and a temperature.

The bottle was labelled as being suitable for children aged three months to 12 years-old and Josh recovered from his illness.

Danger: Josh Carroll, 12, suffered kidney failure two weeks after taking Nurofen for Children for a sore throat

But a couple of weeks later he started to vomit and complained of severe stomach pains.

His GP was unable to pinpoint the problem and diagnosed stress and stomach issues.

But the pain did not subside and a blood test on New Year's Eve revealed Josh, from Ashford, Kent, had kidney problems.

He was sent to Evelina London Children's Hospital where a biopsy showed he had an inflammation of the kidney called tubulointerstitial nephritis, which causes kidney failure. 

Doctors told his parents his condition was a side-effect of taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen - an ingredient in Nurofen.

They stressed he had not had an allergic reaction to the medicine.

Josh spent a total of eight days in hospital but is now back home and has returned to school.

Medicine: The bottle was labelled as being suitable for children aged three months to 12 years 

He is taking steroids to 'kick-start' his kidneys and is on a low-potassium diet to aid his recovery.

Mrs Carroll, a HR Manager, said she felt guilty for giving him the drugs but said she had been told it is a common problem.

She said: 'It was horrible watching him go through it.

'I felt guilty because I'd given him the Nurofen, but I just gave him a normal dose for three days.

'I was surprised when we were told the Nurofen had caused Josh's problems but a nurse said they see a lot of similar cases.'

The worst case scenario is that his Josh's kidneys do not recover. 

'We still don't know how his condition will develop,' his mother said.

'If that happens then obviously there is still a possibility that he would need dialysis or a transplant.

'I feel really surprised that something that is aimed at children can be so dangerous.'

The warnings about the side-effects are on the leaflet inside the Nurofen for Children box but not displayed externally.

Josh said that he is confused why it is described by the firm as a 'rare' problem when it affects up to five per cent of users.

He said: 'On Christmas Day I got really bad stomach pains. I couldn't eat my Christmas dinner.

'I couldn't move because it hurt so much and I didn't really know what was happening.

'If I met the owner of the company that makes Nurofen, I'd ask them why it causes kidney problems.

'And I would ask why it says this is a rare problem when it happens to one to five per cent of people who take it.

'They should put a warning on the bottle because not a lot of people read the leaflet.'

Action: Mr and Mrs Carroll are now calling on Nurofen's parent company Reckitt Benckiser to place a prominent warning on packaging about the possibility of kidney problems

His father Paul, 44, a warehouse manager, said: 'As a parent, watching your child go through that, you fear the worst.

'Every time he got stomach pains he was in agony and going white. On one occasion he went grey.

'He was very brave about it. He had about 18 blood tests.'

Mr and Mrs Carroll are now calling on Nurofen's parent company Reckitt Benckiser to place a prominent warning on packaging about the possibility of kidney problems. 

In a statement, Nurofen for Children said: 'We and we are very sorry to hear about Josh Carroll’s condition, we wish him a swift and full recovery. 

'We have informed our consumer safety team who will be in touch with the family to find out more about the case and investigate further.

'Single reports of acute renal failure with ibuprofen are classified as ‘very rare’ by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which means less than one in 10,000 cases. 

'We encourage all consumers to report any adverse events to help us monitor and ensure the continuing good safety profile of these products.' 

'Based on our internal safety monitoring data of the last 5 years, the incidence of serious renal impairment was less than 1 case per 30 million exposures of Nurofen for Children.'

Neal Patel, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, told MailOnline: 'Although very rare when severe side effects with medicines occur, they can have a serious impact.

'If after taking even a relatively safe medicine like ibuprofen you feel unwell, always consult a pharmacist to see if symptoms are due to side effects or an adverse reaction.'
