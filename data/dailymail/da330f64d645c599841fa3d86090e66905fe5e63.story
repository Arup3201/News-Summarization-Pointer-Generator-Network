Huddersfield Town have parted company with manager Mark Robins just one game into the new Championship season.

Robins and his players were jeered by angry fans at the John Smith’s Stadium after Saturday’s 4-0 thrashing by Bournemouth and, following a meeting with the board, the 44-year-old left the club by mutual consent.

The former Manchester United forward (below) took charge of the Terriers in February last year, helping them avoid relegation before guiding them to 17th-place last season.

A club statement read: ‘Following yesterday’s (Saturday's) first-day defeat, Mark met with the board of directors. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mark and the directors all agreed it would be in the interests of all parties to part company. Accordingly, Mark’s contract was ended amicably and by mutual consent.’

Chairman Dean Hoyle said: ‘Mark has put his all into the job over the past 16 months and made a big contribution to the club. He’s arrived at the club at a difficult time and immediately impacted to keep us in the Championship.

‘Mark’s approach has been refreshing. He has always put the club before himself and worked tirelessly to change our way of playing and we have seen that come to fruition.’

Joint decision: A club statement claimed all parties agreed that it was best to 'part company' 

Assistant manager Steve Thompson and first-team coach Steve Eyre will be in charge for tomorrow’s Capital One Cup tie at Chesterfield.

Robins had previously managed at Rotherham, Barnsley and Coventry before joining Huddersfield.

After goals from Marc Pugh, Callum Wilson (two) and Yann Kermorgant had sunk Huddersfield, Robins had vowed to continue, saying: ‘I will fight but it’s disappointing because we have worked hard over pre-season.

‘The players must take responsibility. The system we play only works when the players put a shift in and too many decided to take a day off. It’s still early days and we dump this result in the waste bin and move on.’
