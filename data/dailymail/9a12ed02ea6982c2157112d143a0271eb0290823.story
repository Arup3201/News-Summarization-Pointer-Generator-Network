A video has emerged showing the harrowing moment when an 18-wheeler crashed on a major interstate outside of Dallas, Texas causing a massive explosion and killing the driver.

The security footage on Interstate 30 caught the explosive moment that the truck flew off an overpass and crashed on the busy freeway below.

There were a handful of cars driving along the President George Bush Turnpike on Saturday afternoon when the 18-wheeler crashed but they were able to slow down and swerve out of the way in order to avoid hitting the fiery truck.

Flying: The 18-wheeler rammed through the guardrail on the overpass and went into a freefall on Texas's I-30

Plummeting: The truck crashed in between the north and southbound lanes of the President George Bush Turnpike and then slid over further

The only reported fatality was the driver of the 18-wheeler, who has been identified as 59-year-old James Anthony Long of Clarksville, Tennessee.

Local station KLTV reports that his exact cause of death is still unknown but an investigation into the what caused the truck to drive off the overpass is still underway.

The truck was transporting ceramic tile, and is owned by a Gallatin, Tennessee-based company called B&M Trucking.

The surveillance footage shows that a number of drivers who saw the truck crash pulled over and rushed towards the vehicle to see if they could help.

Stopping suddenly: The 18-wheeler intersected all of the lanes of the turnpike causing quick stops from fellow drivers

Explosion: The reason for the crash is still being investigated and so is the actual cause of death of the driver

The entire truck was engulfed in flames at that point, however, so there was no chance to save Mr Long from the wreckage.

That said, one passenger vehicle was seen swerving towards the closest exit as the explosion began but the driver cut it so close that they nearly got in an accident themselves.

Both the north and southbound lanes of the busy turnpike for the rest of Saturday evening as they stopped the fire and cleared the crash site.

All lanes of the turnpike were reopened on Sunday morning.

Help: Nearby drivers had to pull over and some ran to see if the the driver could be saved but they also had to stay back in case the crash prompted a bigger explosion
