Ally McCoist is confident that he will remain in charge at Rangers despite Mike Ashley's apparent power grab at Ibrox.

Rumours began circulating earlier on Monday that manager McCoist might be the next through the exit door - something shareholder Sandy Easdale was moved to deny..

At his afternoon press conference on Monday, McCoist said: ‘I spoke to the chairman this morning and I've spoken to Sandy this morning. It was very decent to phone me and give an update.

‘Both board members are comfortable with the situation at the moment. If they are happy with that I am happy with it.

‘My position and objectives haven't changed at all since I took over the job. That hasn't changed and it won't change.

‘Obviously sad with the departure of Graham. It gives me an opportunity to thank Graham for his work at the club.’ 

News that the crisis-hit Scottish club had accepted the Newcastle United owner’s offer of a £2million loan was announced to the Stock Exchange on Monday morning - along with confirmation that chief executive Graham Wallace had resigned.

That followed Philip Nash’s resignation from Ibrox on Friday, with Ashley now set to insert his own people having recently called for both men to depart and demanding an EGM.

That demand has been withdrawn, with the English businessman seemingly the real power behind the throne at Ibrox now having seen off the likes of Dave King and Brian Kennedy, who had both offered financial aid to the club. 

The shareholder, and chairman of the football board, who confirmed he had not spoken to the Ibrox boss, said: ‘Ally McCoist is the manager and we have no ideas of changing the manager.’

On the news of the acceptance of Ashley’s loan, he added: ‘Mike Ashley is a wealthy individual and wants to help the club.

‘The plc board have done what is in the best interests of the club and the fans.

‘The fans have heard so much over the years. We now have something who wants to help the club.

‘Mike Ashley has not intimated he wants full control.’
