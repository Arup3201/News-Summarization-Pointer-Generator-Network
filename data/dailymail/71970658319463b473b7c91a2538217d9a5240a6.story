Costume crazy Saul Duck has staged his own fancy dress advent calendar - by wearing a different costume to work each day.

Saul, 44, from Winchester, Hants, has sported a variety of costumes such as a pantomime dame, Scrooge, a snowman and a Christmas pudding for every working day in December.

The engineering manager at Ericsson Television Ltd was donated the costumes by Express Yourself Costumes and has raised £1,500 for the NSPCC.

'I would say I did get costume fatigue. It was hard work. Beforehand I thought it would be easy but some of the costumes were physically demanding.'
