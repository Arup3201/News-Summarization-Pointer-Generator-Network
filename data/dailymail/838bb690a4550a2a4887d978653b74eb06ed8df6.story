The president of a Florida university won the ire of much his student body on Sunday with an email that suggested sexual assaults can be blamed on booze and promiscuity.

Eckerd College president Dr. Donald Eastman, 69, told the St. Petersburg college's 1,800 students to avoid rape by abstaining from casual sex and avoiding alcohol.

Outrage: President of St. Petersburgh's Eckerd College, Dr. Donald Eastman, has infuriated students with an 'open letter' that blames booze and casual sex on rape

'Virtue in the area of sexuality is its own reward, and has been held in high esteem in Western Culture for millennia because those who are virtuous are happier as well as healthier,' Eastman wrote.

The email appeared to be in response to a growing national conversation about rape--and more specifically, the sexual assault problems on many college campuses--but not everyone found the president's words helpful.

Some think just the opposite.

'I'm pretty p***** off,' sophomore Marlene Heyning, 19, told the Tampa Bay Times. 'That's a pretty insensitive thing to say.'

Most of the ire Eastman has generated comes from what appears to be his blaming student culture for sexual violence.

'You know that these incidents are almost always preceded by consumption, often heavy consumption, of alcohol, often by everyone involved in them,' he wrote.

Not everyone knows, however.

'I don't think casual sex is in any way related to sexual assault; the problem is people breaking boundaries and not learning respect from a young age,' said 18-year-old Katie Wheeler.

Alumnus Joshua K. Wheeler, who started a Change.org petition urging President Eastman to address the controversy, agreed.

'I believe that laying the blame solely at the feet of the two issues you mentioned is an injustice to those affected by sexual assault, and will not solve the problem,' wrote Keeler, whose petition had over 70 signers by Thursday morning.

Few, if any, students, have come out to support the president's letter. However, some appear to believe he meant well, at least.

Eastman told the Gulf Coast school's 1,800 undergrads that 'virtue in the area of sexuality is its own reward, and has been held in high esteem in Western Culture for millennia'

'I don't think he meant any harm, but he didn't put it very well,' student Erica Worth told WTSP. 'He used the words "casual sex" but that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with sexual assault. He just used the wrong words.'

Specific to casual sex, the president wrote:

'No one's culture or character or understanding is improved by casual sex, and the physical and psychological risks to both genders are profound.'

In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times, Eastman largely just restated what he'd already said in the letter.

In response to the backlash, he only challenged his critics: if its not booze and floosiness, what does cause rape?

'But so far,' Eastman said, 'they haven't told me what you really ought to blame it on.'

Dear Eckerd College students,

 

As you know, the College has launched an educational and awareness campaign to attempt to

minimize sexual harassment and assault in our community. The goal is to raise the awareness of

all community members with respect to sexual harassment and assault and to help prevent those

incidents by that increased awareness.

 

You also know that our College is not alone in its concern about such behavior, principally

among its students. And you know that these incidents are almost always preceded by

consumption, often heavy consumption, of alcohol, often by everyone involved in them.

You can do your part in helping this College and this culture address this nexus of problems by

doing two relatively simple things:

 

1. By limiting your own consumption of alcohol, and encouraging your friends to do the same.

Socrates included wine at his Symposium, but he did not get drunk.

2. You can be thoughtful about the dramatic and often negative psychological effects that sexual

activity without commitment can have. Virtue in the area of sexuality is its own reward, and has

been held in high esteem in Western Culture for millennia because those who are virtuous are

happier as well as healthier. No one’s culture or character or understanding is improved by

casual sex, and the physical and psychological risks to both genders are profound.

 

Every year at the end of the Eckerd College Commencement ceremony, I say to the graduating

class, “I hope you feel not only well taught, but well loved. We will miss you.” I mean every

word of that. This open letter is written in that spirit – not as preachment, but with great affection

and true, deep and lasting concern.

 

As always, I am available for your responses or a visit to my office. I wish each of you good luck

in your final weeks of the semester, and a happy, healthy, virtuous 2015.

Sincerely,

 

Donald R. Eastman III

President
