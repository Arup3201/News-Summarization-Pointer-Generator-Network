A young woman is suing Washington state and her former community college vocal instructor, claiming he sexually manipulated her.

Music instructor Kevin Gausepohl, 38, is alleged to have convinced the then 17-year-old student to take off her clothes and touch herself sexually to see how it affected her vocal range.

The alleged misconduct took place two years ago at Tacoma Community College.

Gausepohl - who is also a worship leader at Blaine Memorial United Methodist Church - was charged in Tacoma Municipal Court 
with seven misdemeanor counts of communicating with a minor for immoral 
purposes and one count of obstructing law enforcement.

Gausepohl reached a deal where 
prosecutors agreed not to pursue the charges if he stayed out of trouble
for a year. He kept his side of the bargain, and prosecutors dismissed 
the case earlier this month, reports The Bellingham Herald.

The teacher, who resigned from the school in the aftermath of the incident, now finds himself at the center of a civil action.

The young Gig Harbor woman, identified as S.N. in the lawsuit, is now suing the teacher, the school and the state of Washington, who she accuses of not doing enough to protect her. She was taking the class as part of a scheme enabling high school students to take college classes.

According to police reporting the 
incident at the time, Gausepohl reportedly told the girl that he was 
studying how sexual arousal could change a singer's vocal range.

She claims that he masturbated during one session while she played piano.

Other students told detectives that Gausepohl asked them to be a part of his study, but they declined.

When the college became aware of the incident, Gausepohl was put on administrative leave and he later resigned in October 2011.

Through his attorney, he maintains that he did nothing wrong.

‘Mr. Gausepohl committed no crimes of any sort. He did nothing illegal. The charges were brought, in my opinion, erroneously,’ attorney Robert Perez told KOMO.

The civil suit was filed now after neither the college nor the state responded to an earlier claim filed by the student.
