A jewellery designer beloved of the Duchess of Cambridge is to be honoured with an MBE for her services to fashion.

Nikki Gewirtz, 44, the founder of Lola Rose, will join an exclusive club of designers recognised for their work, among them Anya Hindmarch, Betty Jackson and Alice Temperley.

Speaking to MailOnline, Gewirtz says she was 'absolutely delighted and humbled' to spot her name on the New Year's Honours list, which also included actresses Joan Collins and Sheridan Smith.

Talent: Ms Gewirtz hopes the award will encourage budding designers to follow their dreams

'I am absolutely delighted and humbled,' said the delighted designer. 'The fashion industry has been incredibly supportive and to be joining the ranks of such eminent talent is  an honour.'

Her jewellery business was set up 14 years ago when Gewirtz, then personal assistant to a radio boss, was given a bracelet and thought: 'I could have made this myself!'

One visit to a Covent Garden bead shop later and Lola Rose was born. Originally based in the London-born designer's bedroom, the first piece to make an impact on the fashion world were 2000's 'Tumble' bracelets. 

The strings of delicate semi-precious beads threaded onto a handwoven silk cord were an instant success, with Harvey Nichols and Fenwick among the big name stores to snap them up.

After Halle Berry and Sarah Jessica Parker were seen in them, they became a style sensation with eager fashion fans queuing up to purchase theirs.

Next came what would become Lola Rose's signature - the heart pendant, which is still a favourite today.

'I wanted to create jewellery that made women smile and feel happy when they wore it,' adds Gewirtz.

'A Lola Rose design is an affordable treat that will lift your spirits and make you feel very glamorous.'

Along with Halle Berry and Sarah Jessica Parker, other big names left 'feeling glamorous' in Gewirtz' designs are Claudia Schiffer and Danni Minogue.

The Duchess of Cambridge also remains a fan and has been spotted wearing Lola Rose's £45 crystal heart necklace.

Now Gewirtz is hoping her unexpected success will encourage other budding designers to follow in her footsteps.

'I believe that we must celebrate British designers,' she explains. 'We have some of the finest in the world. 

'It's the ability to think outside the box and break rules that results in the extraordinary and as a nation, we shine at turning things on their head and coming up with something unique.'

With the MBE, Gewirtz becomes part of an elite club of designers to be recognised for their services to fashion.

Among the designers to have honours bestowed on them in recent years are Betty Jackson who in 1987 was handed an MBE and in 2007 a CBE.

Alice Temperley and Anya Hindmarch have both been handed gongs, as has Vivienne Westwood who turned up to collect her MBE in 1992 wearing no knickers beneath her dress.

She repeated the trick for a second time in 2006 when she was invited to Buckingham Palace to collect a Damehood from Prince Charles.
