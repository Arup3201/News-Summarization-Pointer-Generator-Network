Manchester United have made Bastian Schweinsteiger their top summer target.

Sportsmail revealed United's interest last month and the 29-year-old Schweinsteiger is thought to be keen on joining his former boss Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford.

It was Van Gaal who made Schweinsteiger switch from a winger to a defensive midfielder with huge success, and the Dutchman currently masterminding Holland’s World Cup campaign in Brazil sees him as exactly what United need.

Target: Bastian Schweinsteiger is the man Manchester United want to sign this summer

Uncertain: Schweinsteiger is part of the Germany squad at the World Cup but his place in the team is in doubt

Having entrusted Van Gaal with the job of reviving the club, United are ready to abandon the exhaustive process of due diligence which David Moyes was forced to undertake before signing players.

It is understood Moyes’ attempt to sign Porto’s Fernando and Eliaquim Mangala last summer was thwarted when he was asked to provide a detailed cost-justification report on the players when the transfer window was near to closing.

Van Gaal is unlikely to face such obstacles in his pursuit of £15million Schweinsteiger.
