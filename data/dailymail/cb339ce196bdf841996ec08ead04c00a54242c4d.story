Nigel Pearson insists he will have nothing to do with the frantic business of transfer deadline day and wants all his deals concluded in advance.

Leicester City are in the market for a central defender, an attacking midfielder, and a striker – but Pearson is content to fight for Premier League survival with his current squad if his ideal recruits cannot be secured.

Pearson has brought in Andrej Kramaric for £9million and Mark Schwarzer on a free transfer and is interested in Mainz centre-forward Shinji Okazaki. Reports have also surfaced linking Leicester Feyenoord midfielder Lex Immers.

Pearson said: ‘I have generally been looking – but unless the players feel right for us I’ll be doing no more. I've no idea if it will go right to wire but I won’t be sitting in office till late, not my job.

'If something is to be done I hope it will be before deadline. I don’t see why deals done so late, certainly won’t be getting involved myself. Brinkmanship.

'All I think about is what we do, I’m not interested in what others do. We have tried do business want to do and got two done very quickly.

'If can strengthen we will. It will be nice to have options of course, we’ve managed to keep relatively fit squad and hope that continues. 

‘There have been no approaches for our players as far as aware of. We’re not in a position to let anyone go anyway. Never discount anything, there has been speculation surrounding couple of players, but no bids to my knowledge.' 

Pearson revealed Matthew Upson is ready for first-team football having missed the season so far through an ankle injury. 

But the former England centre-back’s return will not influence Pearson’s desire to find another player in that position.
