A US actor has pleaded guilty to stealing $7,000 of jewelry and electronics from a friend's apartment.

Parker Bagley, 23, who is best known for playing the original Jason DeLaurentis in teen drama Pretty Little Liars, was charged in January after stealing two iPads, a BlackBerry, an iPod, three necklaces and a bracelet from the apartment in Murray Hill, Manhattan.

The actor had been told he could stay overnight in the apartment in East 34th Street in October.

But when his female friend later returned to her apartment, Bagley was gone along with several thousand dollars worth of jewelry and electrical goods.

He initially confessed to taking the goods but then later denied them, blaming another acquaintance, according to the New York Post.

But his guilty plea to misdemeanor petit larceny at Manhattan Criminal Court saved him from a felony record on the original top charge of grand larceny.

He paid $3,400 in restitution money with the balance due in June.

Bagley joked with the media on leaving court, reportedly telling photographers: 'I'm just glad they didn't find the bodies, that would have been bad.'

The actor played Jason in the ABC mystery drama Pretty Little Liarswhen it first aired in 2010.

But he was replaced by actor Drew Van Acker after just two episodes.

The series has gone from strength to strength without him and was recently commissioned for a fifth series.

Bagley has also had roles in the 2010 remake of horror classic A Nightmare on Elm Street and police fantasy drama Grimm.

He told reporters outside the court that he is currently concentrating on trying to forge a career in music.
