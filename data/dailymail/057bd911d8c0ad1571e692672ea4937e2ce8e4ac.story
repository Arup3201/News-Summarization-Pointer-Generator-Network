The 10 most expensive signings of this year will cost their buying clubs a combined £1.2billion in fees and wages, with the staggering figures only going to get larger.

But it’s not always the eye-catching numbers or stellar names which make interesting transfer business in January or the summer.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at 10 players who could conceivably move on in 2015 and some clubs who would do their utmost to land them.

Cristiano Ronaldo – Real Madrid to Manchester United (£120m+)

It’s been made patently obvious by Manchester United that they are willing to spend even more money than was splurged last summer in the wake of David Moyes’ disastrous spell in charge. Angel di Maria wasn’t exactly cheap, but luring Ronaldo back to Old Trafford would cost an astronomical fee, blowing the £86million Real Madrid paid for Gareth Bale’s out of the water.

Ronaldo looks as if he’ll return to Manchester at some point – the two parties have been unashamedly making eyes at each other – and with the release of added funds by Ed Woodward, this isn’t beyond the realms of possibility, particularly if Real won everything this season.

Alex Song – Barcelona to West Ham (£15m)

Does he owe anything to West Ham? Maybe not, but there’s no doubting that a hugely impressive six months on loan has seen Song’s stock rise markedly. The central midfielder had looked spent at Barca – a spare part, even making a gaffe when the Catalans won La Liga by thinking he was being asked to lift the trophy with captain Carles Puyol, and not cancer survivor Eric Abidal, despite only appearing fleetingly.

But the way in which he’s ran games since August suggests there is far more to come and it’d be encouraging if he signed a deal with the Hammers, especially given they are ready to move into the Olympic Stadium (and that Song has been consistently asked about that by the club’s in-house media team).

Gareth Bale - Real Madrid to Manchester United (£118m)

Could Bale imitate his childhood hero Ryan Giggs and become an Old Trafford favourite? The Wales international has set the world alight at Real Madrid having helped the Spanish giants to win the Champions League, Spanish Cup, UEFA Super Cup and, this month, the Club World Cup during his short time at the club already.

The 24-year-old has scored a staggering 33 goals in 66 games for Carlo Ancelotti's side since his move to the Santiago Bernabeu in the summer of last year, providing 24 assists in that time too. However, despite his form 54 per cent of Real supporters revealed that they would be happy for the club to accept a bid in excess of £118m for their Galactico in a survey conducted by AS.com.

Bale dazzled during his Tottenham career and his qualities would provide Manchester United with one of the most potent attacks in world football. Red Devils boss Louis van Gaal has refused to discuss reports of making a world record move for the Real star, but United aren't adverse from spending heavily as they look to return to the summit of English and European football.

Fernando Torres – Chelsea to Atletico Madrid (£8m)

Come back to what you know, Fernando. Atletico would surely embrace his return. Torres needs something to reignite a career that will – if he goes on at this rate – only be remembered for the barren years rather than the electrifying devastation he previously caused. His league record at Chelsea (after they paid £50million for him, let’s not forget) was a goal every five games. While on loan at AC Milan it’s one in 10.

The weight of expectation appears to have become too much since leaving Liverpool almost four years ago, and Torres looks as if he needs familiar surroundings safe in the knowledge that he’s adored by thousands.

Sami Khedira – Real Madrid to Arsenal (£13m in January – free in July)

There is a conundrum for Arsene Wenger here. Does he wait and see, try and organise a pre-contract agreement with the German, or go all guns blazing next month and lodge a bid? It’s clear Arsenal are keen – and that Khedira’s future at the Bernabeu is suspect at best. Couple that with their obvious need to bolster in the middle of the park and this is a no-brainer.

Khedira is one of the best in the world in front of the back four and his capture would represent a show of ambition that has severely lacked at the Emirates for years.

Tick him off and the Gunners are only a goalkeeper, two defenders and a striker short. It’d be a start, at least.

Charlie Austin – QPR to Tottenham (£12m)

No other English striker has scored more goals in the Premier League than Austin up until now and he’s the sort of poacher many are crying out for. None more so than Spurs, who’ve struggled going forward since Bale upped sticks to Madrid in 2013.

Roberto Soldado hasn’t kicked on as Andre Villas-Boas, Tim Sherwood or Mauricio Pochettino would’ve hoped and it’s time to offload. Austin wouldn’t come cheap – thanks in no small part to the fact he’s homegrown – but is a gamble worth taking.

The old adage is that if a striker knows where the net is it doesn’t particularly matter what division he plays in is certainly relevant where the 25-year-old is concerned; his record has been exemplary for years. It’s worth noting that Austin’s earned QPR 10 points this campaign.

Paul Pogba – Juventus to Manchester United (£30m)

Sir Alex Ferguson’s biggest mistake was definitely allowing Pogba’s situation to escalate to such an extent that he decided it’d be best to leave Old Trafford. Not too many walk out of the exit door of their own accord – Pogba must be commended for that – but the lure of Manchester United under a new regime, from top to bottom, could be all the persuading the Frenchman needs to return.

United themselves have missed the sort of driving force in midfield that Pogba brings and, now 21 but with a full two seasons under his belt at Juventus, they’d be signing a more refined product.

Petr Cech – Chelsea to Juventus (£7m)

Does Cech, at 32, want to sit on a bench? No, and he’s said as much. Would Chelsea want to allow the Czech a move to another Premier League club? No, because he’s still too good. So it presents the goalkeeper – who has been the standout stopper in England since moving to Stamford Bridge in 2004 – with a decision to make.

He has never played in any of the other major leagues in Europe and may want to try his hand elsewhere. The rejuvenated Juventus could offer him an attractive way out, but there’d be a fair few from Spain and Germany who wouldn’t mind a look as well.

Marco Reus – Dortmund to Manchester City (£30m)

Manchester City are getting to grips with the rigours of Financial Fair Play nowadays and will look at Reus as the sort of major signing they need to make in order to supplement an attack which does at times lack in behind Sergio Aguero. They are probably one player short in that area in terms of consistently threatening the top teams home and away.

The stumbling block, of course, is any interest from Spain but the opportunity to test himself in an infinitely more competitive league should sway Reus’ decision. Either way, it’d make a refreshing change if he didn’t move straight to Bayern Munich.

Ashley Cole – Roma to Crystal Palace (loan)

The loan spell Cole enjoyed at Selhurst Park in 1999 kick-started the left back’s career at Arsenal and if Palace were able to pull this off it’d be quite the coup. Cole has made just 11 appearances for Roma – and none since the middle of November – while an immediate return to the Premier League could appeal, even if the noises are that he’s enjoying life in Italy.

Going back to a club who’ve done so much for Cole’s career would be heart-warming, even if it were only until the end of the season.
