The bikini barista who angered local residents after fat-shaming a customer on the business' Facebook page is facing a boycott.

Meghan Calavan, who owns the self-styled ‘sexy sailor coffee shop’ Sips Ahoy, has been accused of cyber-bullying after calling Jesseka Cladek from Anacortes, Washington, a 'fat b****' online.

Now a Facebook page encouraging a boycott against the small business has been created, with more than 6,200 likes. 

Retaliation: After Meghan Calavan wrote a series of nasty posts on her Sips Ahoy Facebook page about a customer's weight, angry locals set up this Facebook page calling for a boycott of the racy coffee shop

'I beg people please stay away from the coffee stand and don't resort yourself to stooping to their immature level by sending them hate messages,' creators of the Boycott 'sips ahoy' Facebook page have written.

'This page is for the community and public comments for you to speak up about bullying. And to let the public know that it won't be tolerated in our town ... Please treat others as you would want to be treated.'

Its stated aim is to put the coffee 
kiosk out of business and it has posted screen grabs of the original 
comments made by Meghan.

‘I've
 never had to be scared for my life or ever thought someone wish I were 
dead,’ wrote Jesseka on the Boycott Sips Ahoy page.

Many posts call for the coffee shop's imminent closure, accusing it of cyberbullying.

‘I
 made this page to close Sips Ahoy down. We don't want this place of 
business in our small town,’ the administrator states in the About 
section of the new Facebook page.

The drama allegedly began before 
Christmas when someone - believed to be a friend or relative of Jesseka -
 posted a nasty comment on the stand's Facebook page.

Jesseka
 says that Meghan responded by posting a series of vulgar and hateful 
comments referencing the women's weight and appearance.

Meghan
 also reportedly criticized Jesseka's appearance, calling her ‘fat,’ 
advising her to ‘save world hunger by shooting yourself’ and telling 
another commenter that ‘the world would be a better place if [Cladek] 
died.’

‘What if I was unstable and actually did kill myself?’ Jesseka asked King5. ‘Words have an impact on people.’

The Sips Ahoy Facebook page has since been taken down.

As news of the incident has spread in the small town of 16,000 people, Meghan and her family have become the target of threats and even violence.

Meghan has admitted that she and her staff are now scared and that she is sorry for getting involved in the dispute

Sips Ahoy is a coffee shop in Anacortes, Washington, where the baristas serve customers while wearing bikinis

She lives with her father, Kelly, and their home was recently egged and his vehicle dented.

One poster on the Boycott Sips Ahoy page even suggested that someone should put urine or gasoline in a super soaker and burn the coffee stand down.

Meghan told King5 that she and her staff are scared and that she is sorry for getting involved in the dispute.

'I stuck up for myself in an immature manner, I know,' she told King5.

Police say the dent in the Calavans' car means the incident could become a felony investigation. They have advised everyone involved to stop and take a deep breath before someone gets hurt.

Meghan has said she is sorry for her part and claims she's learned an important lesson, while Jesseka has asked for everyone to stop the negative comments and actions.
