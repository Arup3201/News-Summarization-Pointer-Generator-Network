Krokodil, the deadly skin-rotting drug that originated in Russia, may have hit the New York club scene.

Following reports over the past month of cases of krokodil abuse in both Arizona and Chicago, Illinois, the drug is now believed to have hit New York.

A source has claimed that the drug is being sold in at least two nightclubs in New York City’s hip Meatpacking District.

Krokodil fears: Unconfirmed reports suggest that the drug has spread to New York City after previously being reported in Illinois and Arizona

The Verge reports that Sal Ramirez, who witnessed the effects of krokodil while serving in the Peace Corps in Kazakhstan, saw a man being throw out of Le Bain for selling the drug, and was approached by a deal at Westway, who reportedly tried to sell him krokodil and clean syringes in the bathroom.

Krokodil, whose medical name is 
desomorphine, has been called a 'moonshine drug' because addicts are 
often able to cook the narcotic at home. Mixing the substance can leave 
traces of toxins in the final product which addicts then inject.

The drug is made of readily available ingredients such as
codeine, iodine and toxins such as gasoline, industrial cleaning oil, 
lighter fluid and paint thinner. Users filter and boil ingredients 
together, then inject the drug.

An opioid eight to 10 times stronger than morphine, krokodil is so-called because it leave addicts with scaly green skin near the injection site.

The high lasts only a couple of hours, but the drug is significantly cheaper than heroin.

Fears that the drug could head to the
United States have been rife since 2011, when a Drug Enforcement 
Administration official said the agency was aware of its use overseas.

But
even with a drug treatment physician publicly announcing medics have 
now treated four users within the U.S., the DEA has said it is not ready
to recognize it as an immediate threat.

This man's ankle (left) shows symptoms of gangrene and another individual's fingers are rotting away (both cases are from Russia). Doctors fear an epidemic of the cheap heroin substitute in the U.S.

Agency spokeswoman Dawn Dearden told FoxNews.com:
'We, the DEA, are not seeing cases of it. Nothing’s been turned into 
any of our labs. As far as the DEA is concerned, we have not seen any 
cases.'

The announcement comes after a worrying wave of some victims injecting themselves with krokodil because they think it is heroin, doctors said.

The first instances of its use in the U.S. were recorded in Arizona last month. It is already widely used in Russia.

Three cases have now been reported in Chicago and doctors say two of 
the women did not even know they had been sold the drug.

The victims were all aged between 18 and 25 and come from middle-class backgrounds.

Pictures and videos of users in
Russia show blackened fingertips, large open wounds, and even exposed 
bone where skin has fallen off. Prolonged or even short-term use can damage blood vessels, muscle, cartilage, and bone, and amputation is frequently the 
only way to save a patient’s life.

Doctors
have warned of the horrifying side effects of the homemade drug, which 
is said to give a more powerful high than heroin.

The
flesh rotting that is specific to the drug occurs directly at the 
injection site, often leaving users with wounds to their feet or arms.

Dr
Abhin Singla said he instantly recognized the smell of rotting flesh at
Presence St Joseph Medical Center in Chicago and realized krokodil use 
had arrived in the city.

Dr
Singla, the hospital's director of addiction services, told Joliet.Patch he was surprised at how quickly krokodil use had spread from 
Arizona.

He said: 'If you want to kill yourself, this is the way to do it.'

Rabid use of the drug in Russia has caused up to 2.5 million people to register and seek treatment as addicts. The average life span for a user is only two to three years.

'When drug users do it repeatedly, the skin sloughs. It causes hardening of their skin. It will cause necrosis,' explained Dr Frank LoVecchio.

Dr. Frank LoVecchio at Banner's Poison Control Center says he believes the two cases found in Arizona to be the start of a problem in the United States

He added two patients had arrived at hospital asking for help to 
wean themselves off heroin without realizing they had actually been 
injecting themselves with krokodil.

Dr Singla said he hoped warnings about the drug would spread through word of mouth among 
addicts.

He told the website: 'The goriness of the pictures of rotting arms 
and legs are hard to look at, but I think parents really need to share 
them with their kids.'

Krokodil's, medical name is desomorphine and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine and red phosphorous.There are reportedly nearly three million users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East.The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name. Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed.The drug high lasts around an hour and a half. It is three times cheaper to produce than heroin.

Last month, Banner's Poison Control Center in Arizona
encountered the drug when two addicts arrived in emergency rooms with 
their flesh hanging off their body, exposing bone.

'We've
had two cases this past week that have occurred in Arizona,' said Dr LoVecchio, the co-medical director at Banner's Poison Control 
Center to KPHO.Com.

'As
far as I know, these are the first cases in the United States that are 
reported. So we're extremely frightened,' he continued.

Dr LoVechhio
said the two cases he encountered are most likely linked and 
he declined to comment on the appearance of the two users.

'Where there is smoke there is fire, and we're afraid there are going to be more and more cases,' he said.

Some addicts in Russia have developed brain damage and speech impediments in addition to the horrific scars.

Prevalent in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the explosion of users first began in 2002. The numbers of Russians using the drug is thought to have trebled over the past five years.

In 2011 alone, Russia's Federal Drug Control Service confiscated 65 million doses.
