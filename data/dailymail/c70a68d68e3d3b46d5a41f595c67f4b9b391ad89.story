Stay-at-home mom Tessa Bailey, 30, has worked her way into the bestseller lists with her erotic novels

It's the fastest selling adult novel of all time, shifting a staggering 15 million copies in the US and Canada, and an extra four million in the UK.

So it's hardly surprising that women across New York are hoping to harness the Fifty Shades effect by dabbling in a spot of mommy porn.

But these women might not be what you'd expect from erotic fiction writers. 

The New York Post met a stay-at-home mum, a teacher and a pharmacist storming their way up the bestseller lists with their risque, bondage-filled novels.

Stay-at-home mom Tessa Bailey, 30, began her career as an author two years ago by snatching moments to write while her three-year-old daughter napped.

'I'd sneak in words whenever I could,' she told the paper. 

Tessa is now creator of eight titles, including the bestselling 'Line of Duty' series, which features a steamy assortment of police and fire officers.

The mom has earned enough money in royalty checks that last June her husband was able to quit his job as a bartender.

He is now the primary caregiver for their daughter, so Tessa can focus on her writing career.

Tessa's name has consistently appeared on The New York Times and USA Today bestseller lists for adult romance.

With born-again Christian parents, Tessa initially refused to disclose her pen name after securing her first publishing deal in December 2012.

'Eventually I told them and it was like ripping off a Band-Aid,' she added. 'I showed them [the manuscript] and said, 'This is the C-word and the P-word and the F-word. They're all there!'

Tessa believes her success is largely thanks to the rough, dirty-talking men in her books, one - an Irish bartender - she admits is based on her Dublin-born husband, Patrick, 44.

High-school teacher T.D. Hassett, 41, wrote Loving Link by making the most of her time after school hours and over vacations

'The book is called Unfixable, but he jokingly calls it 50 Shades of Patrick!' she said.

High-school teacher T.D. Hassett, 41, from Connecticut moonlights as an erotic writer by making the most of her time after school hours and over  vacations.

But the mother-of-two, whose novels include 'Darling's Desire' and 'Loving Link', said she makes a point of keeping her two very different jobs separate.

'I certainly wouldn't put out anything on the school e-mail, saying: 'Buy my hot romance novel!' she said. 'But it's kind of fun, knowing that I have this whole other side to my life.'

The teacher told the New York Post that she draws inspiration for her novels from her 'wild' days as a college student.

'The erotic material is a mixture of imagination and personal experience,' she said.

Pharmacist Tali Alexander, 35, from Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, also juggles a successful writing career with motherhood and an un-related day job.

Tali, who is the author of Love in Rewind, describes herself as 'every woman out there that has fantasies in her head.

She adds: 'I am a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a wife, a lover, a mother, and a friend. I happen to also be a Doctor of Pharmacy and a business owner by day, and now a writer by night.'
