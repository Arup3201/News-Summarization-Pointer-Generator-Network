'Impossible to go on': Special enovy to Syria Kofi Annan (pictured) has quit his mediator role because he has been unable to unite world powers to stop the country's civil war

David Cameron last night called on the international community to ‘ramp up’ the pressure on Syria as Kofi Annan quit as  special envoy to the country.

The former UN secretary general launched a blistering attack on world powers over their failure to unite over escalating violence in the country.

Mr Annan said he was unable to carry on his role while the current stand-off remains between the five veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council.

China and Russia, whose president Vladimir Putin met Mr Cameron in  London yesterday, oppose intervention.

Mr Annan was behind a six-point peace plan for Syria that has failed to bring an end to the fighting.

Speaking in Geneva, he said: ‘When the Syrian people desperately need action, there continues to be finger pointing and name calling in the Security Council.

‘It is impossible for me or anyone to compel the Syrian government, and also the opposition, to take the steps to bring about the political process.

'As an envoy, I can’t want peace more than the protagonists, more than Security Council or the international community, for that matter.’

Mr Cameron said: ‘We need to actually ramp things up, we need to pass resolutions at the UN, to put further pressure on Syria.’ 

The Prime Minister discussed the crisis with Mr Putin at Downing Street yesterday before going to watch the Olympic judo with the Russian, who is a black belt holder in the sport.

Following the talks, Mr Cameron insisted it was necessary to work with the Russians to persuade them to back a political transition in Syria. But no progress appeared to have been made.

'Let's ramp things up': David Cameron said Annan's resignation showed that the current strategy towards Syria had failed

The UK has long called for President Bashar-al Assad to stand down but Russia opposes foreign intervention on either side.

It is the Russian leader’s first visit to the United Kingdom in seven years and comes amid fears that Moscow is turning away from the international community.

Relations between Britain and Russia have been cool following the poisoning of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in a London hotel in 2006.

Mr Cameron also raised the subject of the Pussy Riot punk rock group – due to stand trial for performing a protest song in Moscow.

There were reports of fierce fighting around the Syrian capital Damascus yesterday and rebels attacked a military air base in Aleppo using a tank captured from government troops.

Pictures also emerged of a mass grave in Artouz, near Damascus.

Opposition activists said the 35 bodies buried on Wednesday were those of victims of a bombardment by regime forces.

Since the Syrian uprising began 17 months ago, some 19,000 people have died.

Ban Ki-moon, secretary general of the UN, said last night that he was looking for a successor to Mr Annan to serve as Syria envoy.

He said: ‘Kofi Annan deserves our profound admiration for the selfless way in which he has put his formidable skills and prestige to this most difficult and potentially thankless of assignments.’
