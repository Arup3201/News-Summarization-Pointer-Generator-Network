Superstar quarterback Peyton Manning is done in Indianapolis.

The four-time NFL MVP was released by his team today after a 14-year run that also included one Super Bowl title.

Manning, 35, and Colts owner Jim Irsay appeared together today during a press conference to make the announcement.

Emotional: Peyton Manning struggled to hold back his tears as he announced that he was being released by the Indianapolis Colts, where he spent 14 seasons as quarterback

Both men paused frequently, fighting tears and their voices shaking, when they appeared together at a news conference at the Colts' team complex.

Fighting back tears, the veteran 
quarterback told reporters: 'I haven't thought yet about where I'll 
play, but I have thought a lot of where I've been'.

He forever will be thought of in Indianapolis as No. 18, the quarterback who led the Colts to an NFL championship in 2006.

'It'll always be a Colt,' Manning said. 'That'll never change.'

He'll be remembered, too, for his record four MVP awards, his 50,000 yards passing and his 200 consecutive starts.

Most of all, Manning will be the guy in the horseshoe helmet who turned around a franchise and transformed a basketball-loving city into a football hotbed that hosted the Super Bowl a month ago.

Manning is coming off a series of operations to his neck and missed all of last season in which the Colts struggled and could only muster two wins.

Indianapolis needed to cut him this week to avoid paying him a $28million bonus.

The Colts are widely expected to begin moving on by taking Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck with the No. 1 overall pick in April's draft.

Injury: Manning's 14-year career with the Colts has come to an end after undergoing three neck operations and missing the entire 2011 season

The relationship between the two has 
been increasingly strained in recent months, with public statements from
 Irsay suggesting Manning’s separation from the team had caused 
tensions. 

In February, 
Sports Illustrated reported that Manning had actually undergone a fourth
 unreported surgery and questions about his health have dogged him 
throughout his rehabilitation.

Although
 his doctors announced that he is cleared to resume his career, no 
timetable was made public for his return and reports about a lack of arm
 strength have proliferated.

Despite those concerns, several NFL teams have shown interest in him, including the Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins and New York Jets.

Champion: Manning forever will be remembered in Indianapolis as No. 18, the quarterback who led the Colts to a Super Bowl victory in 2006

Free
 agency begins March 13, but Manning is now free to sign with another NFL team now that the Colts have formally released him.

Sources
 said Manning expects to have significant dialogue with interested teams
 before he makes a decision on where to resume his career and is will 
likely work out for a few select teams once he analyzes his top choices.

The parting between Manning 
and the franchise that drafted him with No. 1 overall selection in the 
1998 NFL Draft comes shortly before the Colts' March 8 deadline to 
exercise an option in the quarterback's contract to keep him.

Picking
 up the option would keep Manning playing with a horseshoe on his helmet
 through 2015 and include a hefty option bonus payment of $28million.

Still got it? Although Manning's doctors say he is cleared to resume his career, no timetable was made public for his return and reports about a lack of arm strength have proliferated
