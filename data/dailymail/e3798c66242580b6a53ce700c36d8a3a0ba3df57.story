They have a better squad, a better record and – in keeping with the German reputation for meticulous preparation – they appear to have bagged the best accommodation, too.

While England have plumped for an ageing Rio hotel close to a gang-infested slum as their base, the Germans will luxuriate in a  secluded, specially-built £25million resort within easy reach of all their games.

Funded jointly by the German FA and private enterprise, the Campo Bahia resort offers beach-facing villas, hot tubs, a 2,000  sq  ft pool area and its own restaurant.

The German FA has invested in a purpose built beach-front resort for their team at a cost of £25 million - which will open to the public after the World Cup

The training pitches and media centre are just one mile away.

Crucially, the complex – which lies 700 miles north of Rio on the Atlantic coast – offers easy security and is a short ride away from the airport, ensuring that the German players can be delivered to all their games in less than two hours by private  jet. The base will become a commercial resort when the World Cup is over.

By contrast, the England team face a journey of between one and two hours to their training ground – an army base – and up to three hours to the international airport from their hotel, the four-star Royal Tulip in Rio.

Inside, there is cracked paint, a failing internet service and stained carpets. The £200-a-night hotel was criticised on TripAdvisor by one guest who said: ‘It makes a North Korean prison seem like a dream destination.’

England's hotel is located within view of the Rocinha favela in Rio where armed gangs are being targeted by police

The hotel was named the InterContinental until 2010 when a group of gunmen from a drug gang stormed the lobby, taking 30 guests and staff hostage and killing one woman.

A worker said: ‘The hotel was sold and renamed because as you can imagine that incident wasn’t very good for business.’

A staff member at the Tulip said rooms were ‘being renovated’ but added: ‘We have another year and a half to go before the building work is complete.’

When asked if the hotel would be ready in five weeks when the England team are due to arrive he shrugged and said: ‘Look around you, what do you think? We are working very hard to get it ready.’

Inside a room, large brown stains dotted the blue carpet. The bath water took five minutes to run warm and emerged from the tap a dull yellow colour.

One note of consolation for the England squad is that the German resort isn’t yet ready, either.

While is Arsenal colleagues are stuck in the centre of Rio, Per Mertesacker will be able to enjoy the beach in the German FA's £25 million base 700 miles north of Rio
