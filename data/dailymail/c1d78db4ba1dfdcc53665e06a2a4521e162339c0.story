Lupita Nyong'o went undercover in shades and a hoodie as she jetted into New York on Thursday.

The 31-year-old headed to the Big Apple after it was revealed the $150,000 pearl dress she wore to the Oscars had been stolen from her Hollywood hotel room.

On Friday it was reported CCTV cameras were not trained on the area surrounding the door of Lupita's room - meaning the footage has not helped police with their inquiries, according to TMZ.  

Despite the drama of this week, Lupita managed to raise a smile as she met with airport greeters at JFK - but ducked questions from reporters over the incident.

A spokesperson from the LA Sheriff's Department told Us Magazine on Thursday: 'I can confirm a dress was stolen from the London Hotel that belonged to the actress Lupita Nyong'o,"

'We believe it was taken sometime during the day yesterday. We are looking at every scenario; when the cleaners go to clean the rooms they do it with the door open so that's a possibility.'

They added, 'Currently we are still investigating, detectives are interviewing and looking for witnesses.'
