Delve, now 32, has 11 international caps for Wales, the last of which came at the 2010 Six Nations

The Ospreys announced that Cardiff-born Delve, who won the last of his 11 Wales caps against Italy during the 2010 Six Nations Championship, has agreed a two-year deal.

'I am lucky to have played in some great places, and I've travelled the world, but this opportunity to play in Wales was too good to say no to,' Delve said.

'Of all the potential moves I could have made at this point of my career, this was the one that really excited me.'
