A leading ballerina has risked the wrath of theatre chiefs by blowing the lid on the dark secrets of the ballet world including details of anorexia and women unable to have children as a result.

In scenes that would not look out of place in the Natalie Portman Oscar winning blockbuster Black Swan, ballerina Mariafrancesca Garritano, 33, has broken the unwritten code of silence - which she fears could cost her a place in the opening performance of next season.

Dropped: Mariafrancesca Garritano risked the wrath of theatre chiefs by blowing the lid on the dark secrets of the ballet world

Miss Garritano, a ballerina at Milan's famous La Scala opera house, described how dancers were tormented with eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, as they frantically tried to please teachers and opera chiefs with 'the perfect body.'

She added: 'Sadly this is a phenomenon that affects the whole of the ballet world but is very rarely discussed - it's as if there is a Mafia code of omerta (silence) that rules over us and as it result it must never be broken.

'Dancers are having their bodies taken to the limit by teachers and theatre directors who are demanding that the dancers have the perfect body and as such this is a sore that needs to be treated.

Black Swan: The pressures of life as a ballerina were highlighted in the film starring Natalie Portman

Ballet and the world of dance is a beautiful form of art that should not be exploited and put the lives of ballerinas and dancers at risk. One in five dancers in the ballet world are victims of anorexia - even La Scala is not immune.

Miss Garritano, who spoke after rehearsals at La Scala for next month's opening performance of Excelsior, added: 'This message needs to get out there - the people in the industry know the problem exists and the thought that I may be victimised for speaking out has crossed my mind but I hope it does not come to that.

I have personal experience of this problem - when I was a young teenager I suffered from anorexia and my weight dropped to 43 kilos (6.8stone). I didn't think I was fat but the teachers kept telling me I needed to lose weight or I would not get selected for performances.

Eating disorder: Natalie Portman's character in the Black Swan is sick after eating a slice of cake

'For eighteen months I did not have my period and even know I suffer from intestinal problems which I am sure are all connected to my experiences as a teenager. Lots of dancers I know cannot conceive because of the problems they had with anorexia.'

She added: 'It is not unusual to hear ballerinas talk of how they had two crackers for breakfast, a yoghurt for lunch and an apple for dinner just to make sure they can fit into their tutus. I know dancers who would compete against each other to see how little they could eat which is lunacy.

'They resort to this extreme course of action because they are being told that if they don't lose weight then they will not get picked.'

Earlier this year former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips also spoke of the pressures that dancers faced and highlighted the scene in Black Swan where Natalie Portman's Nina is sick after eating a slice of cake to celebrate winning a part in Swan Lake.

Arlene said: 'Staying slender is obviously a big part of a dancer's life,' turning to the cake scene she added: 'Initially she refuses to eat it and when she finally has a tiny bite, you can see the distaste on her face. She knows in a few days time she has to fit into a tutu, which has been measured to fit her exactly. she has to abstain.'

No one from La Scala opera house was available to comment on the revelations

Miss Garrittano added: 'I have never actually seen people being sick after eating but I know ballerinas who have suffered from eating disorders and then gone on to have psycological problems as well. I saw the film Black Swan and it was not very far from the truth at all but this problem is not restricted to dancing it is in fashion as well.'

Miss Garrittano has written about her experiences in a book called 'The Truth, Please, About Ballet' and added: 'When you see ballerinas on stage perfectly combed and immaculately dressed no-one can imagine that behind these people are stories of corruption and threats in order to keep their places in the company.'

No-one from La Scala was available to comment.
