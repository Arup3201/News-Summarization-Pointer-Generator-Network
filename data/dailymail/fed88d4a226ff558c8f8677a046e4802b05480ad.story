Speeding: Hollyoaks actress Gemma, pictured outside Peterborough Magistrates Court. Bissix was caught driving a 108mph on the A1 near Peterborough

Soap star Gemma Bissix has escaped a driving ban for doing over 100mph - after claiming she did not realise her car could go that fast.

The former EastEnders and Hollyoaks star was clocked racing down the A1(M) at 108mph in a Ford Focus.

Bissix, 30, of Walton-on Thames, Surrey, who was recently killed off in Hollyoaks after a car crash, told police she had just hired the car and didn’t think it could go above 90mph.

She admitted the offence after hearing police evidence but was allowed to keep her licence by magistrates in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

Bissix was fined £800 but escaped a ban after the court heard how she regularly uses her car to take her grandfather shopping.

She was driving home from a theatre in Lincoln when she was stopped around 10.30 at night on a stretch of the A1 near the village of Sawtry in good conditions last May.

Gillian McGivern, defending, said: 'She was of the genuine belief her vehicle was not capable of the speed.

'She drives a considerable number of miles every year as a professional and well-known actress.

'She has just finished a fairly lengthy stint with Hollyoaks four weeks ago, and currently has no role at the moment, but anticipates she will have employment in the near future.

'She is sorry for what she has done, and she said to me it is her first big mistake.'

She added that Bissix had recently moved house and had no public transport nearby.

Chairman of the bench Benjamyn Damazer told Bissix: 'There are a number of things that go in your favour, and that go against you.

'We understand you were in a hire car, and you may not have known how it performs.

'There is also no suggestion you were driving in an inappropriate manner, other than your speed.

'However, given your guilty plea, the help and support you give to others using your car and most significantly the problems of getting work, we will not suspend you.'

She said she was not aware that her hired Ford Focus was capable of the speed. File picture

As Clare Bates in EastEnders the actress spent weeks blackmailing character Ian Beale.

Bissix, who has a previous speeding offence, was given six penalty points, taking the total on her licence to nine.

She was also ordered to pay a £600 fine, £160 costs and a £40 victim surcharge.

Outside court she said she was relieved she had not been banned and admitted facing the magistrates had been a ‘scary’ experience.
