Judge David Fletcher spared three brothers from jail after they admitted to wounding two men, telling them: 'Call me Santa Claus'

A judge spared three brothers from jail then told them: ‘Call me Santa Claus’.

The  trio had admitted wounding two men in a fight over the installation of a safety fence at  a building site.

Despite their previous convictions for violence, the siblings were shown goodwill by Judge David Fletcher who handed down suspended jail terms so they could be with their families for Christmas.

As they left the court to celebrate, Judge Fletcher told them: ‘Call me Santa Claus because you have been very lucky.’

Last night campaigners criticised the judge for favouring criminals over their victims.

Adam Fouracre, of the charity Stand Against Violence, said: ‘It shouldn’t matter what time of the year it is – the crime is still the same. If people are allowed to get away with offences like this, offenders will not learn their lesson.’

Mr Fouracre, who set up the charity after his brother, Lloyd, 17, was beaten to death in the street while walking home from a birthday party in 2005, added: ‘Locking people up is not always the answer, but a judge has to protect society and the law-abiding people within it. Prison is supposed to be a deterrent.’

Margaret Lockwood-Croft, a former chairman of the Victims’ Voice charity, said: ‘This is dreadful. The judge has done little  to punish those responsible,  while failing the victims at the same time.’

A court was told the brothers left their victims with extensive cuts to their faces, requiring stitches, after trouble flared as the two men tried to put up a safety fence.

Prosecutor Phillip Beardwell said Craig Tomkinson and Daniel McGing had been working for a development company on a building site in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, when they were attacked after James Bowden arrived with a digger and demanded that the fencing was taken down.

His brothers Ben and Jonathan then arrived and waded in to the dispute last February. Mr Beardwell told Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court: ‘Ben Bowden attacked Mr Tomkinson with his fists. James Bowden attacked Mr McGing. Jonathan Bowden joined in.’

James Bowden, 34, of Audley, Staffordshire, pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding Mr McGing. Ben Bowden, 26, of Bignall End, and Jonathan Bowden, 30, of Silverdale, both in Staffordshire, admitted unlawfully wounding Mr Tomkinson.

Simon Warlock, defending James and Jonathan Bowden, said: ‘Men in their 30s rolling around on a building site is not an attractive proposition. James went to sort it out, but tempers were lost on both sides. This is not just one person acting in a pretty immature  manner – the same might be said of all of them.’

He added: ‘James does digger work and there’s a family skip hire business. He has three children. It is Christmas and all three men are thinking of their children.

‘Jonathan has two children. He heard what happened and he was there out of loyalty.’

Elizabeth Power, defending Ben Bowden, told the court: ‘It was a very stupid act.’ 

Mr Beardwell told Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court: 'Ben Bowden attacked Mr Tomkinson with his fists. James Bowden attacked Mr McGing. Jonathan Bowden joined in'

James and Ben Bowden were both sentenced to 15 months in prison suspended for 24 months. They were also ordered to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work and told to pay their victims £750.

Jonathan Bowden was given a  12-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, with 240 hours’ unpaid work, and ordered to pay £750 compensation.

Judge Fletcher told the brothers: ‘This ridiculous idea that you go together as brothers to sort  out problems with your fists is, frankly, pathetic.

‘This was about nothing but someone doing their job and putting up a fence.’
