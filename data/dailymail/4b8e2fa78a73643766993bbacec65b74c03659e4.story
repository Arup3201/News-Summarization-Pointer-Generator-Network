A heart-warming photo that captured the moment a group of students helped carry their disabled classmate into the Aegean Sea in Greece has been viewed more than one million times on social media.

University of Montana senior Gabrielle Broere was diagnosed with cerebral palsy - a neurological disorder that causes physical disability - when she was just one year old.

Never one to let her disability get in the way of doing things, she went to study in Greece with 16 other students for 17 days last year.

'I wasn't really sure how people were going to react to me and how helpful they would be and if I was going to get left behind,' she told Montana Kaimin.

Most of the time Gabrielle uses a wheelchair to get around although can also use crutches to walk short distances. Several times during her Greek trip she found herself stuck and requiring her friends help.

'There was one time when we were on the ferry and the lift broke so they had four guys carry me down the stairs in my wheelchair,' said Gabrielle.

When the class visited the Aegean Sea they soon discovered that they could no longer push Gabrielle's wheelchair, and without her crutches, she had no way of making it to the water.

Then four of her friends hoisted Gabrielle by her arms and legs, and carried her into the water so she could stand in the sea and feel the water in between her toes. 

'It was surreal,' she said. 'I was in complete awe of where I was and what was happening.'

The Greek expedition wasn't her first trip. In 2011, Gabrielle had taken a 10-day trip to Peru where she first encountered how difficult it can be to access historical sites as a disabled person.

Despite her disability, Broere doesn't plan to stop traveling hopes to see even more of Europe.

'It sucks getting around and it's hard, but I can do it. I've been through a lot now, and I'll continue going through that the rest of my life,' Broere said. 

'I can't let anything hold me back. I would love to go to France and Italy next.'

Broere is graduating in the fall with a degree in History, and plans to go to law school.
