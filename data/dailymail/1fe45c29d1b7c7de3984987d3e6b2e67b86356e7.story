Two of Ed Miliband's most senior frontbenchers today angrily denied plotting against him.

Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham were forced to issue statements dismissing reports they were planning for a 'post-Miliband future'.

The Labour party is in the grip of panic after Mr Miliband's personal ratings plunged, and his MPs fear hopes of election victory are slipping away.

Ed Miliband attended the Stonewall Awards with Labour peer Lord Cashman last night, as speculation swirled about his future

Polls show Mr Miliband he is now less popular than every leader for 30 years who has taken their party to defeat in a general election, with 'depressed' Labour MPs fearing he will cost them victory in 2015.

Even Gordon Brown's personal ratings were better six months before he too Labour to defeat. 

Several senior Labour figures now believe the party would be performing better with almost anyone else in charge.

Last night Mr Miliband attended the Stonewall Awards in central London, which honoured Lord Cashman, a former Eastenders actor-turned Labour MEP.

However, in another incident which will have Labour MPs groaning, Mr Miliband was also pictured awkwardly kissing former Coronation Street star Michelle Collins.

Mr Miliband's fate appears to hinge on whether shadow ministers – some of whom are understood to have met privately to discuss his future – can agree on his fate and engineer a 'coronation' rather than a divisive leadership contest with an election only months away.

The Times reported that Ms Cooper, the shadow home secretary, and Mr Burnham, the shadow education secretary, to have struck a 'non-aggression pact'.

But a spokesman for  Ms Cooper said there was 'no foundation whatsoever' to the suggestion.

'The spreading of lies like this only damages the Labour Party and should be seen as exactly what it is - complete and utter garbage,' he said.

'Yvette, the shadow cabinet and the party are united behind Ed's leadership.' 

Shadow health secretary Mr Burnham said: 'The stories in today's newspapers are complete and pure fiction. There is not a shred of truth in them.

'What I think it's part of is a deliberate and desperate attempt to destabilise the Labour Party and to divide us. But I can say this: it won't work. We are a united team, we are united behind Ed.'

He told Sky News: 'My focus is on the NHS, exposing the damage that this Government is doing and working hard to deliver the Labour government that this country needs and certainly that my constituency needs.

'That is where my focus is. I'm working hard to support Ed Miliband in every single way I can.' 

Mr Miliband also met former Coronation Street star Michelle Collins at the party, where he was pictured awkwardly kissing the actress

At the Labour conference in September, Mr Miliband's wife Justine appeared to duck away as he leant in for a kiss after his speech

However, the denials will only fuel speculation about what - if anything - will be done to bolster or remove Mr Miliband. 

The Labour leader sought to dismiss talk of a leadership coup as 'nonsense' yesterday, as he visited Northampton to talk about buses.

He later told the BBC: 'I don't accept that this matter arises. I believe that what the party wants to focus on is the country.'

Former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain (left) dismissed the leadership crisis as Westminster bubble nonsense' but shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry criticised Mr Miliband's conference speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit

Critics point to Mr Miliband's disastrous party conference speech, which he delivered without notes and forgot to mention the deficit or immigration.

Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry today said she would not have attempted to deliver a speech of such importance without notes, but insisted Mr Miliband had kept Labour 'united' and would make a great prime minister.

She said: 'He made a mistake making a speech ... that makes someone a human being. He is not an automaton.

'It was an hour-long speech. Frankly, I would not have tried to make a 15-minute speech of that importance without notes, but he has been doing it and he made a mistake.'

But she told LBC Radio: 'I think that he is immensely talented, he is a very nice man, he is a deep thinker, he has kept the Labour Party united, he is a man with lots of ideas and he would be a great prime prime minister.'  

Last night Labour's election co-ordinator Douglas Alexander issued a plea for the party to 'pull together', warning: 'Divided parties lose elections.' 

He told BBC1's Question Time: 'He's got challenges, but all of us have got challenges in every political party.

'Every one of us in the Labour Party has to reflect the reality that divided parties lose elections and we have got a profound responsibility to the people who want to get away from the mistakes, the errors, the sheer injustice of this coalition government to pull together, to offer credible change in the face of these tough economic times, and that's exactly what we plan to do.'

Former cabinet minister David Blunkett sought to calm the atmosphere, calling for an end to 'this bout of political insanity'.

'When you are standing on the edge of a cliff it is unwise to believe that by jumping you will suddenly learn to fly,' he told The Guardian.

Former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain claimed it was 'Westminster bubble nonsense' which is a 'world completely remote from what is happening out there'.

However New Statesman magazine, which backed Mr Miliband as leader, accused him of being too remote from ordinary people.

Its editor Jason Cowley said Mr Miliband appeared 'very much an old-style Hampstead socialist'.

'He doesn't really understand the lower middle-class or material aspiration,' he writes. 'He doesn't understand Essex Man or Woman. Politics for him must seem at times like an extended PPE seminar: elevated talk about political economy and the good society.'

Writing on the Politics Home website, shadow business secretary Mr Umunna said the rumblings were 'nonsense which some in the Westminster bubble want to distract us with'.

Mr Umunna added: 'The simple fact is that because of Ed Miliband's leadership we are now within touching distance of being what many thought impossible four years ago.

'We have a leader who has kept us united and overseen the renewal which so eluded us at the end of our time in government. Ed is an honest, sincere man of deep beliefs.'

The runners who are lining up to replace Ed Miliband...

Ruled himself out: Popular former postman Alan Johnson said he had no appetite for the frontbench

Ed Miliband's position is made easier by the fact that none of his potential rivals has declared their hand.

Many MPs want Alan Johnson, the popular former postman, to throw his hat into the ring – saying he has much greater appeal with voters than the awkward Mr Miliband.

But Mr Johnson, who served as Home Secretary under Gordon Brown, has all but ruled himself out, claiming last month that he had 'no appetite for being on the frontbench'.

His refusal to put himself forward will force any plotters to look elsewhere.

It seems the succession would come down to a face-off between shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary.

The bookies are increasingly throwing their weight behind Mr Burnham, who made a well-received speech on the NHS at September's Labour conference – in marked contrast to Mr Miliband's famously poor effort.

It is reported that, emboldened by his conference success, he is already canvassing support; particularly in the North West.

Ladbrokes yesterday cut Mr Burnham's chances of leading the party from 6/1 into 4/1 to be the next party leader, as more and more political punters back him.

The former health secretary has also gained the support of militant union leader Len McCluskey who said last month Mr Burnham is the person who 'most impresses' him on the Labour frontbench.

However, Miss Cooper is still favourite to take over if Mr Miliband goes; attracting odds of 7/2. She can at least count on the support of her husband, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who is unlikely to have much chance of victory on his own. Mr Johnson is further down the betting pecking order on 12/1.

If none of these decide to stand, it could be left to younger frontbenchers such as Chuka Umunna (8/1), with Rachel Reeves and Tristram Hunt outside bets on 16/1.

The man who Labour MPs and party members wanted to be leader – David Miliband – has odds of 20/1. But there is no chance of him taking the reins from his brother because he has stepped down as an MP and moved to the US.

... But the rules mean it is impossible 

Party rules say that to force out the leader, a vote of no-confidence has to be called – and the only way for that to happen is a card vote at the party's annual conference.

No such move was made at the last Labour conference six weeks ago in Manchester and none is scheduled before May's election.

So it seems that those dissatisfied with Ed Miliband's leadership have missed their chance to force him out. Their only hope is that the pressure becomes so intolerable that he decides to step down for the good of the party. This could happen if, for example, a large number of MPs say publicly they want him to go. In that case, other candidates would be able to put themselves forward.

To become a candidate, an MP needs the support of 15 per cent of the parliamentary party – or 39 of Labour's current 257 MPs.

The voting rules in a leadership contest were changed in March to a one member, one vote system for MPs, MEPs, party members and affiliated union members.
