Until cocaine do we part...

An Ohio man called 911 earlier this week to inform police his wife had stolen his cocaine.

When police arrived, Robert Collins, 39, had an apparent change of heart and told police there was no emergency.

Collins refused to discuss the 911 call and he was taken into custody by officers from the Alliance Police Department.

He was arrested on misdemeanor charges of drug paraphernalia and improper use of the 911 system

Police found Collins with a 'pipe used to smoke marijuana in his possession.' 

Collins, who was seemingly wearing a Korn shirt at the time, was arrested on misdemeanor charges of possession of drug paraphernalia and improper use of the 911 system. 

Life really wasn't all that peachy for Collins on Wednesday as officers determined that he also had an active arrest warrant for failure to pay fines and costs on a Canton Municipal Court case, the Review reported. 

After booking at Stark County Jail, Collins was released on his own recognizance.

If he is convicted of the two charges, Collins faces up to 60 days in jail and $500 in fines,
