Cambridge United hero Ryan Donaldson couldn't hide his delight secured a 'dream' Old Trafford replay after his side held Manchester United to a 0-0 draw in the FA Cup on Friday night.

The winger was man-of-the-match  as the League Two side held the Red Devils in their fourth round tie, and was full of praise for his team-mates following the hard-earned result.

'It was hard! Really hard. We got penned in but they have world class players and a draw is a dream result for us,' he said.

'They had two great chances in the second half and we will take a draw any day. It's going to be surreal at Old Trafford but we have been to Wembley twice last year - not bad is it?'

'I thought it was quite an even game in terms of chances. We will take this. It's incredible. We've played at Wembley before and the gaffer has been saying all season that this cup run can give us those moments again.

'How many people will we take to Old Trafford? 15,000? I don't know. How many tickets we get we will sell out I am sure.' 

Meanwhile, Cambridge United boss Richard Money was also full of praise for his side following the game.

'I am extremely proud of each and everyone of my players,' he said.

'In the first half we carried a threat. In the second half it becomes world class players keeping the ball and I thought our organisation was good and we defended really well. We needed the goalkeeper and centre-backs to be good and they were.

'We tried to make sure the game didn't faze them in the tunnel and to look at the badge and go out work hard and see what happens. We were confident we could compete. We'll take the replay of course.'
