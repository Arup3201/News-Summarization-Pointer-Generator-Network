Mother: The child's mother, Ebony McNeil, 31, was with Deon and her two other children when police arrived at the apartment 

Police received a 911 call around 7.30pm Friday from someone on the ninth floor of the George Washington Houses apartment building and arrived to find the battered baby.

The child's mother, Ebony McNeil, 31, was with Deon and her two other children when police arrived, according to the Daily News, and investigators questioned the woman.

No arrests have been made, CBS reports, and investigators are waiting for a medical examiner to determine the cause of the child's death.

Octavia McNeil, Ebony's mother, and her husband told officers that though Ebony was a 'decent enough' mother, they had been raising Ebony's three children.

'We don’t know what happened,' McNeil said. 'It's crazy.' 

McPhail told officers he was 'devastated.' 

Responding: Police, responding to a call, found the child in East Harlem's George Washington Houses apartment building

Grandparents: The infant's parents have both been questioned and the other two children that were in the home are in the grandparent's care (photographed is the apartment building entrance) 

Harry Martinez, 42, a family friend, told the Daily News that Ebony's grandparents were always watching her children and he described her as 'laid back.' 

'They’re a beautiful family ... I just can’t imagine this,' he said.

The infant's parents have both been questioned and the other two children that were in the home are in the grandparent's care.
