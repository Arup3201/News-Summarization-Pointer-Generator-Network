Michelle Obama’s 50th birthday bash invitations included an
unexpected surprise – no dinner.

Invitations for the First Lady’s January 18 party tell
guests to ‘eat before you come’ and ‘practice your dance moves.’

The party’s fitting title is ‘Snacks & Sips &
Dancing & Dessert,’ sources told the Chicago Tribune.

No food for you: Michelle Obama will have only snacks and cocktails at her 50 birthday party

The dancing party will be light on food, but heavy on dancing,
perhaps in a nod to Ms Obama’s ongoing physical fitness campaigning.

The entertainment and guest list are a closely-guarded
secret, the Tribune noted.

She first hinted at party plans during a visit last month to
a children’s hospital, according to the paper.

When asked by a young girl about her party, the First Lady
said ‘it might involve some dancing, a little Dougie.’

Just dance: Guests will be dancing the night away with only snacks to eat

Ms Obama first busted a move dancing the Dougie earlier this
year during an appearance on “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” Mr Fallon danced
with her – in drag.

Etiquette author Emily Post’s granddaughter Lizzie Post told
Radar Online that the party instructions are a bit unusual.

‘I don’t think it’s rude, but I do think it’s a little . . .
different than what people are used to,’ she explained. ‘How’s that for putting
it delicately?’
