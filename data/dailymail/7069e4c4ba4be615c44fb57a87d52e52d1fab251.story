Britons are losing their taste for white sliced bread, with sales of pre-wrapped loaves falling by 31million last year.

This is partly because more of us are eating croissants and pastries for breakfast and replacing lunchbox sandwiches with bagels, wraps and pittas.

Also, more shoppers are buying specialist loaves – while the popularity of breadmaking machines and TV shows such as The Great British Bake Off has led to renewed interest in home baking.

British shoppers are shunning traditional loaves in favour of so-called healthier bread such as pitta (pictured) and wraps

Retail analysts Kantar said sales of 
sliced wrapped bread dropped by 1.8 per cent – or 31million loaves – in 
the past year despite an overall increase in bakery sales of 3.5 per 
cent.

Sales of wraps, pittas and bagels soared by a sixth.

The white sliced loaf – a UK staple 
since the 1930s – has been criticised for its texture, high salt content
and low nutritional value.

The Grocer magazine said: 'Not only has the mainstay of the category lost share to a new wave of bread alternatives including thins, wraps and bagels, it has also suffered from persisting negative --and not entirely justified -- perceptions in terms of health, say commentators.

'Adding to bread’s woes, input costs soared last year, putting pressure on margins, while one of the worst wheat harvests in history has resulted in quality so low that, in January, Hovis was forced to renege on its commitment to use only UK wheat.'

Michael Murphy, commercial director at Irwin’s Bakery said that health has become an increasingly important consideration especially over the salt content of bread.

Demonised: Industry experts say that white bread has an unfairly negative reputation because it is in fact low in fat and calories

He believes unfair representations of its health credentials in the media are contributing to the shaky performance of wrapped bread.

'White bread, in particular, has been demonised, but in fact it is low in calories and low in fat, and is fortified with vitamins and minerals,' he told the magazine.

Indeed nutritionist Ian Marber says that 
there is no real health benefit to switching from white bread to pittas:
'Despite what people may think, there is little nutritional difference
between a white sliced loaf and a pitta bread or bagel.

'It might taste different and add variety to your day, but it is a 
mistake to think making changes to the bread you buy will provide added 
health benefits unless you are switching from white bread to wholemeal, 
which is richer in fibre.'
