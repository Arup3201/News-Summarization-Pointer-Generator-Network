Army officials have warned Australian soldiers about the threat of being attacked when on home soil after an uniformed Digger was abused by a group of men on a Sydney street.

Defence top brass are so concerned about a Lee Rigby-style attack happening in Australia they have issued an email warning servicemen and women to be on alert.

Just 48-hours after the email was sent, the Prime Minister last week raised the country's alert level to High after receiving a series of terror-related briefings.

Defence top brass are so concerned about a Lee Rigby-style attack happening in Australia they have issued an email warning servicemen and women to be on alert

The email, sent by the Defence Security Authority (DSA), said a soldier in Sydney was approached by a group of men who told him to 'go to the Middle East so we can blow your f***ing head off you ****,' according to The Sunday Telegraph.

A number of people witnessed the incident and the soldier just walked away. 

Last year British soldier Lee Rigby was targeted on a London street outside his barracks by two Muslim extremists who ran him down in their car and tried to decapitate him. 

Australian intelligence agencies fear a repeat incident here - and issued a warning in a notice marked 'Security Intelligence Report'.

'The Defence Security Authority assesses that this incident of anti-Defence sentiment is related to Defence’s current and possible future operations in the Middle East,' it wrote in the email, seen by The Sunday Telegraph.

'A further escalation of anti-Defence sentiment in Australia cannot be discounted.'

The email said that since Australia's deployment in the Middle East, the Defence Security Authority has received 'an increase in reported threats of verbal abuse'.

'On 22 May 2013 Drummer Lee Rigby, a serving British ­soldier was run down by a vehicle and then hacked to death outside Woolwich Army Barracks in ­London.

'The attackers remained at the scene encouraging onlookers to film the aftermath — one claiming the attack was in response to British soldiers killing Muslims overseas and stating the British public would not be safe as long as it supported military deployments on Muslim lands.'

Australian Defence officials' concern is based on the accessibility to weapons such as knives and cars.
