It looked like spring had finally arrived this week or even that summer had come early.

But just 24 hours after the warmest day of the year so far, Britain has woken up to drizzle and some parts will see temperatures drop by 10 degrees.

Today the mercury will struggle to rise about 13C and plans to have a barbecue weekend will be scuppered by the cold front coming in resulting in a damp and chilly forecast for the next few days.

Yesterday temperatures topped 22.5C and 
Britain was hotter than north Africa, as temperatures reached just 20C 
in the city of Tunis, Tunisia.

Training exercise: Lifeboat crews take advantage of stormy seas in Blackpool to test their new Â£210,000 boat

Stormy seas: The beach famous for its attractions including the Blackpool Tower and illuminations is closed

Optical illusion: Light reflects off plastic covering rows of forage maize in farmer Joe Foot's Dorset fields making them look like rice paddy fields

Poor yield: The 33-year-old had a bad harvest last year because of the bad weather and has covered his crops to protect them this year

Lifesaver: Mr Foot said the plastic was essential to ensure he grows enough food to feed his herd of 750 dairy cows this winter

But the hot, sunny weather gave way 
to with heavy rain across the South East last night, spelling a wet 
commute to work this morning.

According to Charlie Powell, of the Met 
Office today 'will be showery, with temperatures around 10C lower than they have been in the South East in recent days.

'There will be some sun but temperatures will be around 12C or 13C which is more average for this

He said temperatures on tonight and on tomorrow night could dip down to single figures with a possibility of frost.

What a difference a day makes: Just 24 hours after the warmest day of the year so far, Britain has woken up to drizzle and some parts will see temperatures drop by 10 degrees

Hottest place in Britain: A group of people ride down the river in Cambridge yesterday. Plans to have a barbecue weekend will be scuppered by the cold front coming in and arctic winds plunging across Britain

'There will be a mix of sunshine and showers across England and Wales on Saturday and a drier day on Sunday,' he added.

'Next
week will see temperatures continue to be average, or slightly below 
average, so it will be more of a typical Spring week.'

The sudden change in the weather today is due to a slow change - mild south or southwesterly winds have been bringing warmth from the near continent, but at the same time cold air has been gathering to the north.

Spring day: Christine Virginie enjoys the hot weather at West Dean College, West Sussex yesterday - tonight termperatures could dip down to single figures with a possibility of frost

Earlier this week it started to move across Scotland and last night a cold front sank south across the country as the winds flipped to a cold northerly allowing the arctic air to plunge across Britain.

Although temperatures are expected to recover early next week, forecasters say the unsettled conditions will remain until after the early May bank holiday weekend, when warmer air is set to sweep in from the East.

With the weather remaining topsy-turvy, 
the odds of snow falling in any British city in the first May bank 
holiday have been slashed from 10/1 to 2/1.
