A gown worn by British screen siren Vivien Leigh in definitive Hollywood film Gone with the Wind has emerged for sale for £45,000.

Leigh wears the sweeping pale blue negligee in the pivotal scene of the 1939 film in which her character Scarlett O’Hara’s daughter dies in a tragic horse riding accident.

Fans and experts feared the iconic gown had been lost over the years - but to their amazement it reemerged in the 1980s, 40 years after the film was released.

A gown worn by British screen siren Vivien Leigh in definitive Hollywood film Gone with the Wind has emerged for sale for £45,000

It was revealed that the film’s costume company had given the gown to one of its seamstresses as a wedding present once filming was over.

The gown remained in her family until the ‘80s when she sold it to a prominent collector of Gone with the Wind memoribilia, the current seller.

Experts expect the gown to fetch £45,000 when it goes under the hammer.

The film, which also starred Clark Gable as Leigh’s lover Rhett Butler, is regarded as one of the greatest of all time.

Leigh, who was married to Laurence Olivier from 1940 to 1960, won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Scarlett O’Hara.

Catherine Williamson, director of fine books, manuscripts and entertainment memorabilia at Bonhams, said: “It’s really wonderful to be able to offer any costume from Gone with the Wind let alone Vivien Leigh’s negligee.

'She wears this negligie under a fox fur in the scene where Bonnie Blue Butler has the fall off the pony and dies.

'It is a critical moment towards the end of the film, and you can see the negligie quite clearly under the fox fur.

'For many years collectors thought this piece was lost - no-one could find it.

'It wasn’t at the big MGM auction in the ‘70s and it wasn’t at the Western Costume Company, the company that made the costumes for the film.

'What had happened was that in the days after the film was made one of the seamstresses that worked on the film got married.

'The company gave her this dress as a wedding present and it remained in her family for decades.

'Towards the end of her life around 20 years ago she contacted the present owner who is a major collector of Gone with the Wind memoribilia.

'He bought it directly from her and it has since been confirmed as the piece that appeared in the movie.

'That doesn’t happen very often - when things go missing they don’t often come back.

'It’s lovely that something from one of the most iconic films of all time that we thought was lost was not lost at all.

'Gone with the Wind costumes are very rare and collectors will see this as a real opportunity.'

Rhett and Scarlett remain one of film's most iconic couples and the dress was worn in the pivotal scene where Scarlett falls to her death from a horse

The auction will take place at Bonhams in New York on November 25
