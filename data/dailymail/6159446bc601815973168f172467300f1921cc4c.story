Sydney Siege survivors have revealed intimate details about the horror they experienced in the Lindt Cafe. 

They have opened up about the cruel mind games played by their captor, Man Horan Monis, and their belief that he had a bomb - a 'threat which stopped them from doing anything'. 

John O’Brien and Marcia Mikhael are two of a number of victims who have spoken about the deadly siege which played out in front of the world in an interview with Channel Seven. 

Ms Mikhael, has opened up about the devastating moment ‘that she gave up hope’ while being kept hostage by Man Haron Monis at the Lindt Café in Martin Place - certain that all 17 captives would be shot dead.

Monis, a self-made sheik, made terrifying, calculated threats which made Ms Mikhael certain that she would not leave the building alive.

John O'Brien, the oldest hostage at 82, was also one of the first to escape. He says took a risk because 'I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out' 

‘He told us, “For every person that escapes, I will shoot two”. That was when I lost hope,’ Mikhael recounted tearfully.

‘That’s when I asked him if I could call my kids and if I could speak to them.’

‘I actually wanted to hear their voices for the last time.’

Ms Mikhael is a 43-year-old mother of three from Glenwood in Sydney’s northwest.

She was desperate to tell her children that she loved them, believing Monis would soon shoot her dead.

‘I told them that I loved them very much and I needed them to remember that,’ Mikhael said.

‘My eldest son kept telling me ‘Mum, stop it, everything’s going to be okay’ and I kept telling him ‘I know, I know but just remember that I love you, I love you so much’ and then I had to hang up.'

Selina Win Pe was among the hostages forced to stand up against the Lindt Chocolate Cafe windows and hold up a flag by the gunman during the 17-hour ordeal 

Mr O’Brien, 82, has also describes how it felt when on that fateful Monday when the staff and customers at the Lindt Cafe realised that a regular morning at a coffee shop had become a horrifying hostage situation.

‘All hell broke loose once he locked the front door,’ Mr O’Brien told Seven News.

‘He said “I’ll kill you all one by one”. 

Mr O’Brien was one of a group of three people who managed to escape at 3.37pm when the former tennis player noticed a green button which opened the doors, allowing them to flee.

The eldest hostage knew that if the plan didn’t work he would surely be killed by the gunman.

‘I was probably either going to get shot in there or shot trying to get out so…’ Mr O’Brien’s voice falters as he tries to explain his horrific conundrum.    

'You have 15 minutes'. They are the chilling final words from crazed gunman Man Haron Monis to his hostages, said Selina Win Pe

'I said please don’t shoot me, please don’t shoot me. I only have my mum, please don’t shoot me,' she said, unable to hold back tears

Several of the hostages were forced to record video messages, including Selina Win Pe, who has told her story to Liz Hayes for the upcoming 60 Minutes siege special

Hostage Selina Win Pe has revealed the horrifying moment crazed gunman Man Haron Monis told her she had just 15 minutes to live.

Monis turned to Ms Win Pe during the height of the siege in the Lindt Cafe at Martin Place, where he took 18 people hostage on December 15, and forced her to beg for her life. 

'I said please don’t shoot me, please don’t shoot me,' she told 60 Minutes in an upcoming special to air on Channel Nine.

'I only have my mum, please don’t shoot me. He looked me straight in the eyes and said "you have 15 minutes"'.  

60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon'.

The network told Daily Mail Australia: 'The siege story will (also) include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.'

'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story.'

Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million.

Ceremonies for Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson came more than a week after the deadly siege

'Liz Hayes will be reporting. Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story.'

It's also understood that Julie Taylor, 35, the barrister at Eight Selborne Chambers who was 19 weeks pregnant when she was caught up in the stand-off, could also be featured in the 60 Minutes special.

She was the hostage protected by her close friend Katrina Dawson, who died after she was hit by a bullet at the conclusion of the siege, and the one according to media analysts who has the most interesting story to tell.

Siege victim Marcia Mikhael, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, is believed to have secured a deal of between $350,000 and $400,000 to tell her story to the Seven Network, as the commercial rivals opened up their cheque books to secure survivors for their respective upcoming specials. 

The Nine Network confirmed that 'Liz Hayes will be reporting on the Sydney siege special, due to air in the next couple of weeks. 'Many of the survivors specifically requested that she be the one to interview them and tell their story'. Selina Win Pe revealed to her that hostages were told they had '15 minutes' to live

In extended interviews with 60 Minutes reporter Liz Hayes, the hostages are asked 'at what point did you think you could die?'. 'When he fired the first shot,' Fiona Ma answered

One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000

It's understood Channel Nine put in an offer of up to $300,000 for Marcia Mikhael to tell her horror story from inside the Lindt cafe on December 15th. However, Ms Mikhael, 43, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, opted to go with Seven after they submitted an even bigger offer, Daily Mail Australia understands.

The networks have been so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they have been sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all.

Harriette Denny was among the last group of hostages to successfully escape the clutches of Man Monis from inside the Lindt cafe. She will be featured on the 60 Minutes special

Meanwhile, Channel Nine's 60 Minutes special is believed to feature up to 10 survivors who escaped after being held by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours. 

Daily Mail Australia understands the rival specials were set to air on Sunday February 1, which is the week when the television ratings season kicks off, rather than Australia Day as has previously been claimed. This would be after the coronial inquest starts on January 29.

However, confusing the matter for Seven, is the screening of the Men's Final at the Australian Tennis Open on that Sunday. Some media experts suggest that the Seven special could be screened immediately before the big match to counter any move by Nine.

The push to have hostages tell their stories has met with mixed reaction, former NSW state coroner John Abernethy suggesting a legal intervention could stop the interviews being aired. 

Former Victoria Premier Jeff Kennett was even more strident, suggesitng Sydney cafe siege hostages selling their stories to the media is 'just plain grubby'.

'Two innocent hostages lost their lives. I do not think it is morally right that the media pay, and any of those who were saved should profit from the attack. Just plain grubby,' Mr Kennett tweeted.

Cafe manager Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson were killed when the 17-hour siege ended in a shoot-out in the early hours of December 16.
