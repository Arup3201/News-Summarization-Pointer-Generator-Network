Jailed: Corey Davies, 20, was today jailed after killing his sister and her fiancé in a car crash in Tonyrefail, South Wales, leaving his baby nephew as an orphan

A drunk driver was today jailed after killing his sister and her fiancé in a car crash - leaving his baby nephew as an orphan.

Corey Davies, 20, had been drinking 'all night' when he took Raquel Davies, 23, and 25-year-old Lee Jenkins out for a spin in his white BMW convertible near Tonyrefail, South Wales.

He overtook a line of traffic on a winding A-road and hit a bank, causing the car to spin off the road and flip onto its side.

Miss Davies and Mr Jenkins died instantly because the BMW's soft-top gave them no protection when it overturned, while Davies fled the scene unscathed.

The couple's nine-week-old son, Harley, was left orphaned by their deaths.

Today, Davies was jailed for seven years at Cardiff Crown Court after admitting two charges of causing death by dangerous driving.

The court heard Davies was 'extremely drunk' and had taken cocaine to celebrate his sister's birthday when he offered to take her and her fiancé on an early morning shopping trip to Tonyrefail, near Pontyprydd.

David Wooler, prosecuting, said: 'Davies was under the influence of drink and cocaine when the accident happened after an all-night drinking session to celebrate Raquel’s 23rd birthday.'

Witnesses saw Davies overtake a line of traffic at up to 60mph on the A4093 near the village of Gilfach Goch, with his BMW 'twitching and snaking' on the road’s wet surface.

As he sped past a Ford Transit van, the car hit banking at the side of the road and flipped onto its side, over gate and into a field.

Mr Wooler said: 'Davies got out of the car and was moaning and groaning “my sister, my sister”. 

'He flagged down a passing car, being driven by a friend, who thought Davies had been assaulted and took him to his mother’s house.'

Davies - who broke his ribs and bruised his kidneys in the crash - then took himself to hospital, the court heard.

Police later took blood tests from him and it was calculated that he had been twice the legal limit at the time.

At the beginning of the hearing, Davies told the court full of relatives: 'I’m sorry to both families. If I could change anything I would have.'

Davies, from Porth, Rhondda, wept uncontrollably throughout the 40-minute hearing, during which he appeared by video-link from Cardiff prison.

John Hipkin, defending, said: 'No apology can put matters right. Whatever sentence the court passes the burden of what he did will remain with him for the rest of his life.'

Baby Harley, who was not in the car at the time, is now being cared for by his grandmother Anne.

In a victim impact statement, she told the court: 'My life with never be the same. 

'I care for Harley and every time I see him I see Lee and I take some comfort from that.'

The court heard Davies had a previous conviction for driving with excess alcohol, for which he had been banned from driving for 18 months.

Sentencing Davies today, Judge Eleri Rees told him: 'No doubt the guilt will always be with you and will be a heavy punishment to bear. 

'But you will have the opportunity to rebuild your life at the end of the sentence.'

Speaking via a spokesman, Davies's family said they were devastated at having 'lost a son and a daughter'.

They said: 'Raquel was perfect in every way and was a devoted mother to her young son.

'She would help anyone out at any time and was a beautiful person inside and out. She loved her fiance immensely.'

Meanwhile, Mr Jenkins's family said in a statement: 'He loved his fiancée Raquel dearly and was enjoying being a new dad to Harley who is just nine weeks old.

'Lee was a keen and talented footballer when he was younger. We are heartbroken at the loss of Lee and will cherish all the great times and wonderful memories he gave us.'

South Wales Police said the smash served as a warning to other young drivers not to get behind the wheel after drinking.

Speaking after the case, Inspector Carwyn Evans said: 'This was a tragic case and Corey Davies will spend a considerable amount of time in prison. This sentence should be a warning to other drivers.

'Any driver who gets behind the wheel of a vehicle under the influence of drink or drugs and driving in the manner he did is putting their own life, the lives of other road users, and as we have seen here, the lives of loved ones in grave danger.'

Davies will serve some of his seven-year prison sentence in a young offenders' institute.

He has also been banned from driving for five years.
