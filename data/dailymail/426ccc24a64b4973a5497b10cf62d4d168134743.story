After her weight crept up to 29 stone, breaking a chair was the last straw for this mother of three.

So afraid was Kim Freshwater that she’d flatten any more furniture, she finally overhauled her diet.

And the triumph of losing more than half her body weight led to the 45-year-old being named Woman of the Year by Slimming World yesterday.

Before shedding 17 stone, Kim Freshwater, 45, weighed 29st and wore size 38 clothes. She suffered back and knee pain, breathing difficulties, high blood pressure and was unable to fit in armchairs

Mrs Freshwater lost 17st and now weighs 11st 7lbs and wears size 10 or 12 clothes. She says she is happier than she has ever been before. She can now do many things she was unable to do before her weight loss, such as cycling and playing tennis

In two and a half years, Mrs 
Freshwater’s weight fell from 28st 12lb to 11st 7lb as she dropped 13 
dress sizes from a size 38 to a 12.

Yesterday,
 she explained she had been afraid to go to see her son accept an award 
at school as there were only flimsy foldaway chairs to sit on.

She said she often avoided weddings and parties for fear of embarrassing her family.

And the 45-year-old missed a family funeral because she couldn't walk between the church and the graveside.

‘A
 chair had already collapsed under me while we were staying with friends
 for Christmas,’ she said. ‘It was mortifying and I was constantly 
scared that I would break something else.’

Mrs
 Freshwater, who lives in Havant, Hampshire, with husband Lee, 53, an 
accountant, and their teenage children, had to walk with sticks, 
suffered from high blood pressure, breathing problems and joint pain. 
She also slept on the floor in hotels for fear of buckling the bed and 
had to get a belt extension on planes.

Her
 incredible weight loss started after her GP prescribed vouchers for her
 local Slimming World group. Whereas before she ate no breakfast or 
lunch but gorged on lasagne, chips, crisps and chocolate in the 
evenings, now she eats three home-cooked meals a day.

She said: ‘I actually eat more now than I did before but I’ve learned to make good choices.’

She
 also plays tennis, swims, cycles, walks miles – without her sticks – 
and even abseiled 350ft down a tower in Portsmouth, raising £600 for 
charity.

She added: ‘I only
 wore black but now my wardrobe’s full of every colour. I don’t think I 
realised how unhappy I was until I became as happy as I am now.

‘I had to walk with sticks and I couldn’t fit in the seats at the cinema or on rides like rollercoasters.

‘I once broke a chair at my friend’s house, which was mortifying, and I even slept on the floor when we went away because I was so scared the bed wouldn’t be able to take my weight.

‘I’ve missed so many wonderful moments with my family and I can never get those back, but now I’m determined to make up for lost time and there’s so much I want to do.’

Mrs Freshwater had weight problems for most of her life and at the age of 11 was already a dress size 14 to 16.

Then, when her father died when she was still a teenager she started comfort eating. 

Before she lost weight, Mrs Freshwater avoided attending events for fear of embarrassing her husband and children. She missed her son's school award ceremony because she feared she would break the chairs

She said: ‘My dad had always been my best friend and I suppose I used food to fill the hole he left.

‘As I got older, people would always say how pretty I’d be if I lost weight and I did try, but the diets I did were only ever quick fixes - I’d regain all the weight I lost as soon as I stopped.’

She added: ‘I felt I’d let my family down because I wasn’t there to support them.

‘I
 was so upset about it one night that I couldn’t sleep and there was a 
programme on TV about funerals, showing how severely overweight people 
need special coffins and how difficult it is to cremate their bodies.

‘It was as if someone was trying to tell me something - I didn’t ever want to have to put my family through that.’

Mrs Freshwater suffered from high blood 
pressure, breathing problems, and back and knee pain because of her 
weight so her GP prescribed her 12 weeks of vouchers for her local 
Slimming World Group.

Mrs Freshwater said: 'I've missed so many wonderful moments with my family and I can never get those back, but now I'm determined to make up for lost time and there's so much I want to do'

She said: ‘I was worried people would judge me or the scales wouldn’t go up to my weight.

‘I needn’t have been so nervous though because everyone made me feel so welcome and my consultant, Georgina, was really friendly.’

Mrs Freshwater lost 44lbs in her first 12 weeks and has now lost a total of 243lbs, dropping from 28st 12lbs to 11st 7lbs.

She has transformed her eating habits, swapping one huge meal a day for three healthy home-made meals and snacks.

She said: ‘I actually eat more now than I did before but I’ve learned to make good choices.

‘The
 plan isn’t a diet, we all eat together as a family and we have lots of 
our old favourite meals, just adjusted so they’re cooked in a healthier 
way.’

Before her weight loss, Mrs Freshwater did not eat any breakfast or lunch - she just gorged on a huge supper. Now she eats three small meals a day

Now she plays 
tennis, goes swimming, walks miles - without her sticks - and has 
started cycling again for the first time in 20 years.

She even abseiled 350 feet down the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, raising £600 for charity.

She said: ‘I love that I don’t need seatbelt extensions on planes any more, I can sit in chairs with arms, I can shop on the high street - the list is endless.

‘My husband jokes that my weight loss has been hard on his bank balance because before I used to have four pairs of shoes but now I’ve got about 40 and I only wore black but now my wardrobe’s full of every colour of the rainbow.

‘I don’t think I realised how unhappy I was until I became as happy as I am now.’
