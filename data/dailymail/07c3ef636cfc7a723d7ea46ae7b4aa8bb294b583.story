To borrow a line from the song that provided the soundtrack to England’s 2018 World Cup bid presentation, it was looking like a beautiful day on that December morning in Zurich four years ago.

There was a fresh layer of snow beneath the feet of Lord Coe and London Mayor Boris Johnson as they went for a pre-dawn run beside the lake. Having already masterminded London’s successful bid for the 2012 Olympics, Coe probably felt much like he did in the same Swiss city where he had broken world records all those years earlier - quietly confident of victory.

The night before, in the luxurious Baur Au Lac hotel where all the FIFA fat cats were staying, England’s bid ambassadors had moved from meeting to meeting with a swagger.

At one stage Prince William, David Cameron and David Beckham appeared together at the top of the main staircase, a formidable triumvirate all seemingly content that no stone had been left unturned ahead of the vote the next day. Even Jack Warner seemed to be on board, having been skilfully seduced.

Beckham spoke gushingly of their good friend ‘Jack’. It appeared they would be getting the vote of the CONCACAF chief and quite possibly those of his acolytes on the FIFA executive committee.

There was a sense that England had nailed it, unlike the Russians, their main rivals to host the 2018 tournament. The Russians’ eve-of-vote press conference had seemed limp, apathetic even. ‘They’ve thrown in the towel,’ remarked one observer. Either that or they didn’t need to make much of an effort.

By the end of the final presentations, there seemed little to suggest England were not in a strong position to follow the capture of the Olympics by securing the right to host the greatest show of all. The presentation and the video, complete with that Elbow soundtrack, was terrific, so superior to anything else on offer. FIFA even rated England the best technical bid.

And then came the vote, and the crushing sense that England had been humiliated. English faces turned grey in that auditorium. FA officials felt nauseous.

How could they have been so naive to think they had a chance? Naive to think this was a game that could be won using the tactics they had employed. They had won two votes, one of which belonged to their own Geoff Thompson. The Prime Minister couldn’t get back to the business of running the country fast enough.

There might have been a whiff of corruption even before the votes were cast but on Thursday Hans-Joachim Eckert’s report claimed England may not have played strictly by the rules either.

The FA fiercely refuted this in a strongly worded statement, but Eckert was scathing about their attempts to secure the support of the disgraced Warner.

Eckert accuses England of ‘damning the integrity of the bidding process and the image of FIFA’ in chasing Warner’s vote. He reported the England bid team ‘often accommodated Mr Warner’s wishes in apparent violation of bidding rules and the FIFA code of ethics’. Among the alleged transgressions was the help they provided to a ‘person of interest to him (Warner)’ in finding ‘a part-time job in the UK’.

England were also said to have provided ‘substantial assistance’ in setting up an Under 20 training camp for the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation in the UK in response to Warner’s ‘improper demands’.

The truth is, the England bid team were reluctant amateurs in a highly professional game, and if they were taken to the cleaners in Zurich they were tucked up again by FIFA yesterday.

Pursuing Warner in quite the manner they did was a mistake. It felt unpalatable at the time and the FA were left looking all the more uncomfortable when Warner was eventually exposed and bounced out of football for good. Everyone knew, even then, that Warner was corrupt, and the FA were foolish to associate with him.

To think Prince William and the Prime Minister listened to Warner promising his support, only for him to then renege on his vote. Warner made mugs of them.

The fact that public money — more than 10 per cent of the £21million spent on England’s bid — went towards trying to get Warner onside is a further source of embarrassment.

The FA were essentially punished for being more transparent than anyone else. The Russians ‘lost’ their emails. The Spanish just wouldn’t co-operate. And Qatar? Well, it’s just not easy to prove corruption, claimed the report.

It is amazing that Eckert attacks England for a £35,000 sponsorship but goes much easier on Qatar for a similar one that cost them £1.15million. It was, as Damian Collins MP said quite rightly, a whitewash, a joke, and one that became all the more ridiculous once investigator Michael Garcia appealed to overturn Eckert’s summary of his report.

Even by FIFA standards, that was a game changer, a day when the world governing body descended into chaos.

While the credibility of FIFA has never been under greater scrutiny, the FA do not come out of this unscathed.

Andy Anson and his bid team might have felt it necessary to court men such as Warner, but in doing so some of the most prominent people in the country were dragged into a tawdry affair and today it looks all the more embarrassing: an error of judgment.
