Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad, who attempted to become the first person to swim 
between Cuba and Florida without a shark cage, was forced to abandon her effort 
early this morning - roughly halfway through her journey.

Nyad was vomiting when she was brought aboard a boat at 12.45am, 29 hours after she jumped into the water on Sunday.

'I am not sad. It was absolutely the right call,' she said.

Nyad, who is 61, struggled through ocean swells, shoulder pain and asthma 
Monday before she was forced to give up the 103-mile swim.

She was hoping to become the first person to swim from Havana to Key 
West without a shark cage.

The challenge – which she also failed to 
beat at the age of 28 – would have taken 60 hours.

Tanned
and freckled from long hours training in the open seas of the 
Caribbean, she seemed confident before starting off just before sunset 
Sunday.

She said the still air and shimmering water flat as a plate were perfect conditions for her attempt to make the epic swim.

'The adrenaline's flowing now,' Nyad said at a jetty in western Havana as she looked at the water. '... This is what I dreamed of: a silver platter.'

She gave a heartfelt cheek-kiss to the commodore of the Hemingway Marina in Havana, who helped arrange logistics of the trip, changed into a black swimsuit and blue swim cap and showed off the goggles she planned to wear: light blue during the night for better dark vision and smoky charcoal tinted to protect her eyes from the blinding daytime sun.

After an assistant greased her shoulders and armpits to prevent chafing in the salty water, Nyad played 'Reveille' on a bugle, thanked several dozen well-wishers who came to see her, then jumped feet first into the sea.

Nyad said it has been a lifelong dream and she hoped would inspire people to live vigorously during their golden years.

There she goes: The 166 kilometer stretch between Cuba and the South of Florida is expected to take three days

Instead of using a cage, Nyad will rely on divers and the deployment of an electronic boom to surround her with a current that is imperceptible to humans but is strong enough to keep most sharks at bay

'Thirty-three years ago I stood on a beach close by here and looked out at a giant sea. ... Now I'm almost 62 years old and I'm standing here at the prime of my life,' she said.

'I think this is my day.'

Nyad first had a go at this crossing back in 1978, when she swam inside a steel shark cage for about 42 hours before sea currents hammering her off course put an end to that attempt.

The following year she set a world record for open-water swimming without a shark cage, charting 102.5 miles (165 kilometers) from the Bahamas to Florida, then retired from competitive endurance swimming.

Still, she said the aborted Cuba attempt stuck with her all these years, and upon turning 60, she started thinking about a comeback.

'What if I went back and tried to chase that elusive dream of Cuba?' she said. 'And I started training and I found it was in my heart and it was in my body. ... It seems almost like a dream to me, but now it's real.'

The waters Nyad will spend the next 60 hours in are shark infested

In preparation she made 8- to 15-hour swims over the last two years off the Caribbean island of St. Martin.

Australian swimmer Susie Maroney successfully swam the shark-filled waters from Cuba through the Straits and to the Keys in 1997, though she used a cage.

Nyad's team is deploying an electronic boom to surround her with a current that is imperceptible to humans but is strong enough to keep most sharks at bay.

Whitetip sharks are not deterred by the field, so divers will be standing by to gently discourage any of those who get curious - without harming them.

For the record to have been considered 
valid, Nyad had to make the swim without a wetsuit. Her crew were navigating, monitoring her health and providing nourishment.

But she was not 
allowed to touch the boat, nor can her helpers hold her, until she 
emerges fully onto dry land.

Five
support vessels carried 45 navigators, nutritionists, doctors, shark 
wranglers and a film crew that has been documenting her story.

She planned to stop every 45 minutes for 20-second hydration breaks - water, juice, sports drinks.

Every 90 minutes she'd rest for two minutes and nibble on bread or a spoonful of peanut butter.

By
day two she was drinking heated water and hot chocolate to ward 
off hypothermia, a threat after so many hours at sea.

Nyad 
embarked on a northwest course aiming to arrive at a point in the Keys a
little east of due north, compensating for sea currents.

She
called the attempt a 'symbolic moment' for increasing understanding 
between the United States and Cuba, two nations torn by five decades of 
animosity and mistrust.

'I'm under no delusion that my swim is going to make any new political ramifications,' Nyad added.

'But it is a human moment between the two countries.'

Absolutely the right call, Diana Nyad said
