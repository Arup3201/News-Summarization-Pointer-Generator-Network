This Christmas, visitors to Windsor Castle will get a fascinating glimpse into the Victorian Royal Family's festive celebrations.

From December 1 until January 12 2014, traditional wreaths and garlands will adorn the Castle Precincts and some of Windsor's most famous and luxurious State Apartments giving visitors an insight into how Victoria and Prince Albert celebrated 161 years ago.

Although monarchs have 
celebrated Christmas at Windsor since the 12th century, the couple were 
responsible for popularising the celebration in the form we know today.

Festive makeover: Royal Collection exhibition administrator Roxy Hackett applies the finishing touches to a festive table in the State Dinning Room

Now, that's a Christmas tree! Royal Collection exhibition conservator David Westwood applies the finishing touches to a six-metre Nordman Fir Christmas tree in the St George's Hall

The
star of the show is a six-metre Nordman Fir Christmas tree, which will 
be erected in St George's Hall, while a decorative tree will be placed 
in the Crimson Drawing Room, set against the spectacular gilded 
interiors of George IV's private apartments.

In the Waterloo Chamber, a grand table piled high with glittering silver-gilt from the Grand Service will be laid ready for a seasonal feast. 

The service, which was commissioned by George IV, is still used to this day by The Queen at State Banquets.

The highlight of the State Dining Room Christmas display will be a silver-gilt table centrepiece designed by Prince Albert in 1842/3.

Just as it was: The State Dinning room has been recreated to show how Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and their family in the mid-19th century would have enjoyed Christmas

Centrepiece: The highlight of the State Dining Room Christmas display will be a silver-gilt table centrepiece designed by Prince Albert in 1842/3

Stop by: From December 1 until January 12 2014, traditional wreaths and garlands will adorn the Castle Precincts and some of Windsor's most famous and luxurious State Apartments

The extravagant centrepiece is 80cm 
high and adorned with sculptures of four of Queen Victoria and Prince 
Albert's favourite pets: Eos, the Prince's devoted greyhound, the 
dachshund Waldman, and the Highland terriers Cairnach and Islay.

During
Christmas 1860 a visitor to Windsor described the ‘mighty sight’ of 50 
turkeys being roasted in the Great Kitchen, a huge baron of beef (a 
joint of beef consisting of the two sirloins joined at the backbone) and
a woodcock pie of 100 birds presented to the Queen each Christmas by 
the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

On
December 7, 14 and 21 and Sunday 22 December, families are invited to 
join a storyteller in St George's Hall for a glimpse into royal 
Christmases past and to hear tales of feasts and horse-drawn sleigh 
rides in the Castle grounds. 

Great setting: The star of the show is a six-metre Nordman Fir Christmas tree decorated with dazzling baubles and lights

Ornaments: Roxy Hackett applies the finishing touches to a festive table in the State Dinning room, which visitors can enjoy over the next two months
