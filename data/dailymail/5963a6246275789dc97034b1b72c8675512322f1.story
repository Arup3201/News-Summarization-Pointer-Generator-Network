With an economic mess so deep that rioters have taken to the streets in desperation, one would not have expected sports facilities to be among the Greek government's priorities.

But ministers are pressing ahead with plans to build a new £75million motor racing circuit capable of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix.

The move is likely to irk citizens across the eurozone, whose single currency has been brought to the brink of collapse because Greece failed to control its debt problem.

It may also surprise Greeks, who have been told they must accept austerity measures as their country heads for its sixth year in recession.

Ministers have 'unblocked' £24million of funds to build the racing circuit on a site in Xalandritsa, near Patras.

The total cost of the project is expected to reach £75million.

It could mean that Greece joins super-rich Monaco, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi on the Formula One calendar.

Details of the plan emerged only a week after hundreds of protesters hurled petrol bombs and clashed with riot police in Athens.

Up to 100,000 took to the capital’s streets during the largest anti-austerity protest seen there in more than a year.

 marched to the Greek parliament chanting ‘EU, IMF Out!’, on the day of a
 general strike against a new round of cuts demanded by foreign lenders.

As the rally ended, youths dressed in black threw stones, chunks of marble, petrol bombs and bottles at police, who responded with tear gas and pepper spray.

The protesters were trying to force the government to reject demands for additional savings of £9billion in savings over the next two years, along with a further £1.5billion in taxes.

Greece has promised the spending cuts and tax increases in an effort to secure its next tranche of aid from the EU and IMF.

Politicians in Brussels warned on Tuesday that Europe faced 'economic and social disaster' if unemployment continues to rise among young people.

Some 18.2million people are unemployed in the eurozone, the highest level since the euro was introduced in 1999.

Unemployment in Greece is expected to rise to 27 per cent.
