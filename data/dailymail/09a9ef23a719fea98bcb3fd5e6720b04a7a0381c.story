A family told of their horror yesterday after a fox crept into their home through a catflap and attacked their young son.

The two-year-old boy screamed in pain as the animal bit his heel, drawing blood.

His startled parents ran upstairs after being alerted by the cries and found the fox sitting at the end of the child's bed.

The animal then darted into another room and hid under a bed before running out of the house in New Addington, south London.

The parents, who did not wish to be named, took the toddler to Croydon University Hospital, where he was put on a course of antibiotics.

Yesterday the child's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, 46, said the boy has been left with two bite marks on his heel.

She said: 'When I heard, my whole body went like jelly. I could not move. You think if they did not hear the fox, then it could have run off with him.'

Mrs Vaizey, a care worker who has four children and nine grandchildren, said she had heard about fox attacks, but never dreamed it would happen to her family.

'When it is this close to home, it is so frightening,' she added; 'But he is fine. He is a tough little boy.'

She added: 'He is the sort of boy that falls over all the time and has a laugh about it afterwards.

'But I just think it is so lucky they were still up at the time. '

She said the family had now put a panel over the catflap to prevent the fox coming back after the incident at 2am on October 30.

She added: 'My daughter wanted to kill the fox. She said she never had a problem with them before, but now she hates them.

'She said this one looked really healthy and that he looked well-fed, so you do worry.'

In June 2010, nine-month-old twins Lola and Isabella Koupparis were mauled by a fox that entered their home in Hackney, east London. Lola received facial and arm injuries, while her sister received arm injuries.

The boy's grandmother, Sharon Vaizey, said she had heard about fox attacks but never dreamed it would happen to a member of her family

In February last year, a fox got into the bedroom of a one-month-old baby in Bromley and bit the child's finger off.

Urban wildlife expert John Bryant said yesterday: 'Attacks like this are extremely rare and it involved the heel.

'There have been cases where people have been lying on sunbeds in their garden and have woken up to find a fox nibbling their toes.

'The fox is obviously investigating. It is very common for foxes to come in through catflaps.

'It is always wise to keep the cat in and shut the catflap at night. It is another incident, but fortunately minor.'Â 

The attack - which left the boy needing hospital treatment - happened in New Addington, south London last month
