A truck packed with fireworks crashed on a Chinese motorway in Hebei Province, causing an explosive display.

The driver of the lorry managed to escape after impact, before a blaze gripped the overturned vehicle.

But as emergency services arrived on the scene, the fire prompted the load being carried to erupt in a colourful display. 

One quick-thinking onlooker recorded the incident, showing the truck engulfed in flames as fireworks erupted in reds and greens.

But despite the beauty of the scene, the impromptu display caused real trouble for the emergency services, with fireworks exploding at all angles.

According to local news, it took fire crews an hour and a half to bring the flames under control.

But fortunately, nobody was hurt during the incident.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation by Chinese authorities.
