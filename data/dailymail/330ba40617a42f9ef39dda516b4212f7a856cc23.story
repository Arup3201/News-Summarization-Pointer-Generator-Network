Jonny Evans maintains he didn’t wilfully spit at Papiss Cisse – and would’ve been locked out of the family home if he had.

The Manchester United defender reacted angrily during their 1-0 win at St James’ Park earlier this month, with television cameras seemingly catching him in the act.

But Evans insists the altercations is not what it appears, even if the FA felt the need to slap him with a six-match ban.

Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared up at St James' Park

Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence

‘I can totally understand there is an image around that, and in the British game and our society it’s not something that is accepted, and rightly so,’ Evans told The Times.

‘But I was able to go home and look my mum and dad in the eye because if I’d genuinely spat at someone I think they would have been disgusted in me.

‘It’s not the background I come from in Northern Ireland. My mum and dad would have given me a rollicking if I had done that.’

Cisse was handed a seven-match ban for a clearer spit in the aftermath, the additional game owing to a previous red card for the Magpies this season.

Evans added: ‘I did not have the intent to spit at an opponent, so when the FA charged me with that I could never accept it.

‘To spit at anyone is one of the most disgusting things you can do; it’s low and it’s cheap. I would never think to spit at someone. You just look like an idiot.’
