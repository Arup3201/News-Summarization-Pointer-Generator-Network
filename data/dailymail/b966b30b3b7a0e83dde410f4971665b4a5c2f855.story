A couple who routinely drugged their toddler daughter so they could 'catch up on their sleep' have been given suspended prison sentences.

The drug addict mother, 41, and father, 40, regularly gave their two-year-old daughter the liquid paracetamol Medised - intended for children more than twice her age - for a year and a half so she was less likely to wake in the night and disturb their sleep, a court heard.

Gloucester Crown Court was told the little girl also sometimes had the sedative Diazepam - used to treat severe anxiety and agitation.

The parents admitted cruelty after drugging their toddler with Medised so they could catch up on their sleep

The girl had to be fed through a 
nasal tube when she was born due to problems caused by her mother's use 
of Diazepam and the heroin substitute methadone while she was pregnant, 
the court heard.

Instead
of weaning their daughter off the tube, the couple, from Nailsworth in 
Gloucestershire, continued to use it routinely because it was easier for
them, prosecutor Kannan Siva said.

They
went on to give her Medised on a nightly basis between the ages of two 
and a three and a half so they could sleep, he added.

The
little girl was taken into the care of an aunt in June 2011 after her 
'plainly selfish' parents, who met in rehab, told a social worker what 
they had been doing.

Judge 
Jamie Tabor QC criticised the couple for their 'remarkably stupid' 
actions, and told them he would have jailed them were it not for the 
fact it would deprive their daughter of weekly supervised visits from 
her parents.

The parents, whose identities cannot be revealed, walked free from court after being handed suspended sentences

Their offences were not malicious but 
they were quite plainly selfish to spare themselves the tribulations of 
parenthood, the judge said.

'Every 
parent of a young child will have undergone sleepless nights because the
child is unsettled for one reason or another. You chose to adminster 
Medised, which was not intended for a child that age, and you chose to 
keep very quiet about it,' he said.

'I
see before me a wholly inadequate man who was rather struggling with 
this child and a mother who was more concerned with herself than her 
child,' the judge added.

Both parents admitted being cruel to 
their daughter between September 2009 and June 2011 by routinely 
administering Medised - a liquid medicine typically prescribed to 
children between the ages of six and 12 to relieve cold and flu 
symptoms, fevers or headaches.

Her mother admitted a similar charge 
involving her daughter taking Diazepam, but denied that she had given it
to her daughter deliberately.

'Plainly selfish': The mother, 41, and father, 40, were given suspended sentences at Gloucester Crown Court

The couple's denial of a charge of administering methadone to their daughter was accepted by the prosecution.

They had faced another charge of cruelty by using a feeding tube on the child, which was not proceeded with.

The
woman was sentenced to 18 months suspended for a period of two years, 
while the man was given a 12 month sentence suspended for the same 
period.

Both were placed under a curfew between the hours of 8pm and 6am for a period of six months.

The
court heard the couple's daughter was eating normally within a month of
being taken into care and had grown into a 'bright little button'.

Her parents have supervised access to their daughter at weekends.

It might send the little girl 'off the rails' if she were to be deprived of the visits, the judge said.

Her
aunt said in a recent statement: 'She is a much loved, beautiful and 
bright little girl, surrounded by the people who love her deeply, 
especially her mum and dad.'

Giles Nelson, representing the girl's mother, said the couple met when they were both in rehab in 2001. 'I am afraid they went badly wrong as parents,' he said.

Martin Steen, representing her father, said: 'He thought that by giving Medised he was relieving her [his daughter] and relieving himself. He now recognises he was wrong and is ashamed. He loves his daughter dearly.'

Judge Tabor told the couple that with their own drug addiction histories they should have known better and what they had done was 'most remarkably stupid'.

He said the mother had show no real effort to address her own addictions and was still taking the highest prescription of methadone he had ever seen.
