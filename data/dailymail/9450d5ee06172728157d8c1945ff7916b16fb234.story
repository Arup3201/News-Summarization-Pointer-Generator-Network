Known as the most glamorous of Twags (that’s Tennis WAGs), Kim Sears certainly kept that title as she arrived at Wimbledon today.

There to support long term beau Andy Murry in his first game of the tournament against Belgium's David Goffin, Kim chose to wear her own 'tennis whites' in a show of support.

With her trademark blow-dry firmly intact, Kim swept passed waiting photographers outside the stadium looking a tad nervous, no doubt residual fears from Andy’s crushing defeat at Queens earlier this month.

There was no need to worry this time, though, as Andy won his first round match against David Goffin in straight sets.

Sporting bare legs Kim showed off her deep tan against her white lace Jennifer dress from Reiss and white wedged heels.

Clutching some serious arm candy in the form of her £1395 over sized cream leather Aspinal of London 'Marylebone' tote and her favourite Pandora charm bracelet, the only pop of colour in her outfit came from a thin pink belt and the green ribbon holding her VIP access card.

Despite the tension Kim seemed to enjoy the day, a times looking positively elated

However Kim’s nerves are likely to be running high as she watches her boyfriend of nine years on court today.

The 25-year-old artist, who met Murray who met Murray when she was studying for her A levels aged just 17, was courtside at his surprisingly easy defeat earlier this month at the Queen’s Club in London.

The British No 1 was beaten in straight sets 7-6 6-2 by Radek Stepanek, the 35-year-old ranked No 42 in the world, and beaten well.

Kim looked a little anxious as she arrived this morning, no doubt due to Murray's shock defeat at Queen's earlier this month

However, despite the undoubted pressure he is feeling entering Wimbledon as defending champion, having Kim by his side will be a comfort.

Murray, 27, has famously praised her ability to gauge when he needs company and when he wants to be alone as ‘fundamental’ to their relationship.

He said: ‘Kim sees all of the emotions when I win or lose a match, she can tell how I’m really feeling.’

Kim applauded her boyfriend on court as she watched the crucial match with a friend

Kim and Andy live together in a a five bedroom property with two double garages in Oxshott, Surrey, which he bought for £5m in 200, and while she runs her own successful animal portrait company she is a constant and devoted support to the tennis star.

Murray's own mother Judy once described Sears as the 'best thing' to happen to her son.

The pair are obviously close, greeting each other in a warm embrace as they both took their seats before the beginning of the match.

Judy, 54, herself a tennis coach entertained some of the waiting crowds by playing a few rallies with them.
