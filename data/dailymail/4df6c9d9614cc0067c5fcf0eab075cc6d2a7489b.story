Murdered: Private Simon Jeans died in 1996 after he was hit over the head with a rock in Croatia

A father has spoken of his shock at learning that body parts belonging to his murdered son have been discovered in a hospital laboratory 17 years on.

Distressed Terry Jeans, 67, fought a long battle to bring the soldier's killer to justice after he was attacked in Croatia.

Private Simon Jeans was set upon by a gang of thugs who hit him over the head with a rock on September 8, 1996.

He died nine days later from a brain haemorrhage at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, aged just 25.

Parts of Pte Jeans' body - including his brain, lungs and heart - were held by Surrey Police as they investigated the murder. 

The organs were taken to King's College London to be forensically examined, and when the forensic department closed in 2000, they were transferred to Guy's and St Thomas' hospital.

Mr Jeans, from Portsmouth, Hants, said he did not know the body parts had not been reunited with his son's body.

He now wants to hold a ceremony to bury them - something which the Co-operative Funeralcare have quoted him around £1,600 to do.

Mr Jeans said: 'Nobody has really said sorry. I haven't heard that word at all.

'These things don't seem to matter to the police, but they do to me.'

Mr Jeans claims he had to spend around £20,000 to bring his son's killer to justice and said this new cost is something he simply cannot afford.

Seeking an apology: Terry Jeans, 67, says he had no idea his son's organs had not been reunited with his body

He said: 'I have been alone doing this and they should be accountable for their errors.

'It is not about my son or the suffering that this has caused, it's about money and it shouldn't be that way.'

Apology: Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital said it would liaise with the police to pay for the burial of Pte Jeans' organs

A spokesman for Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital said the body parts had been stored in a 'sensitive and secure way', adding that once the hospital identified them last year it had contacted the police forces involved.

The spokesman said: 'Guy's and St Thomas' would like to apologise to the families affected for the distress that this situation has caused them.'

The hospital also said it would liaise with police to reach an agreement to help Terry with the costs.

Detective Inspector Jon Vogel, from Surrey Police, said: 'At the forefront of our minds throughout this sensitive operation is the need to respect the concerns and wishes of families.

'We need to give them a clear, compassionate and open account of the circumstances, and to assist them in the return of the remains of their loved one should they wish it.'

Terry said: 'They should be putting right what they have done wrong. It has only made me hateful.'
