A Florida pizza delivery girl who miraculously survived being shot in the face and disfigured on Halloween night by a masked mugger has left the hospital with message of hope.

'Stay positive and just be yourself and love yourself,' 20-year-old Lindsey Cooper told WPBF viewers last week. 'That’s how I am. And even with my face looking like this, I still love every bit of myself.'

Cooper lost part of her jaw when the man in a skeleton mask fired at her in front of her West Palm Beach home and stole her purse.

Shocking crime: Lindsey Cooper, 20, was shot in the face on Halloween night after her pizza delivery shift

Gruesome: The 20-year-old lost part of her jaw and many of her teeth after the man in a skeleton mask blasted off part of her face to steal just $40

But, she says, 'I’m stronger than that person...[I'm] not angry, not mad, just disappointed. For somebody to just do that.'

Cooper was returning home from her shift as a Papa John's delivery driver when a man in a skeleton mask allegedly shot her in the face and nabbed her purse with just $40 in tip money.

'I just don’t understand why somebody would do that to my daughter, over tip money, Lindsey's mother Dawn Cooper told WPTV in tears.

'I heard a pop. I was asleep in my room right there. It woke me up. It was just one pop and I thought it was a firework,' Dawn Cooper said.

Lindsey's mother recalls her daughter frantically running into their Coconut Grove home clasping her chin. 

She said, 'This entire part of her face was gone. The gums the teeth, the bone, everything.'

Lindsey was treated at St. Mary’s Medical Center where she had reconstructive surgery and had her mouth wired shut.

Tragic: 20-year-old Lindsey was only a few feet from her front door on Coconut Road when she was shot in the face for her tip money she earned delivering pizza 

Dawn Cooper says she believes whoever robbed her daughter must have known her schedule because he was waiting for her to arrive back at her home just in time to rob her.

'That’s my baby girl. That’s my heart. Somebody did a number on her,' said Lindsey's brother Jorden.

He told WPTV that he hopes police finds his sister's shooter.

Lindsey's family isn't sure when her daughter will be home from the hospital but she does know that her daughter will require expensive medical care.

Lindsey's friends and family have started a Gofundme to help raise money for her recovery.
