A celebrity nurse starring on a popular reality show about a New York hospital has learned the hard way that oversharing on social media can have real-life consequences.

Katie Duke, one of the stars of ABC's New York Med, has been fired for sharing on her Instagram account a photo depicting an empty trauma room strewn with medical supplies where a man had been brought in for treatment after he was struck by a subway train.

Ms Duke, 33, accompanied the image with the caption: 'Man vs. 6 train.'

It got her in trouble: Nurse Katie Duke was let go from her job at New York Presbyterian Hospital for sharing on Instagram this image of a messy trauma room where a man had been treated after being struck by a train

Reality star: The 33-year-old veteran nurse was one of the stars of the ABC show New York Med, which is currently in its second season

Her side of the story: Duke explained that the photo that got her dismissed after seven years on the job was taken by a doctor, and that she merely reposted it

Just hours after posting the image online, the nurse got a call from her superiors at New York Presbyterian Hospital informing her that she was being let go after seven years in the ER.

Duke's dramatic firing has made it into the second season of New York Med, which premiered late last month.

The nurse told ABC News that hospital officials pointed out to her that she was not terminated for being in breach of hospital policy, or for violating patient privacy - but rather for being insensitive.

The 33-year-old medical professional claimed the photo of the trauma room that got her fired was originally taken by a doctor, and that she merely reposted it on Instagram.    

According to Duke, the physician in question was not punished for photographing the room.

The nurse insisted that she did nothing wrong by sharing the picture, but admitted that doing so might have offended someone unfamiliar with emergency room dynamics.

‘If you hung around nurse’s station and heard the way we talk about injuries, life and death you might get the wrong impression but it’s just a coping mechanism,’  she told ABC. ‘Now I check my posts so no one gets offended or thinks I am a cold-hearted person.’

Miss Duke described her very public termination as a 'traumatic' experiences, saying that New York Presbyterian was her 'family.'

‘Losing my job took me out of a comfortable spot,’ Duke told St Louis Post-Dispatch last month. ‘Everyone in the same situation would think, “What now?” You just have to pick yourself up, think of a plan and deal with it.’

The firing did nothing to slow down the 33-year-old nurse, who has since landed a new job along with a couple of endorsement deals.

Duke also has launched a new website and a line of merchandise featuring her catchphrase popularized on New York Med: 'Deal with it.'

Miss Duke, who describes herself as a 'risk taker,' 'intellectual' and 'nursing maverick,' has maintained a robust presence on social media, with nearly 25,000 followers on Twitter and over 16,000 on Instagram.

Despite her unceremonious dismissal, Duke had nothing but praise for New York Med, which she said was the only program on television that shows what it's really like to work in a hospital.

‘Look at TV shows like Nurse Jackie — no way is that a good depiction of nurses,’ she said referring to the Showtime series starring Eddie Falco. ‘And Grey’s Anatomy is good drama, but it’s not real.’

Miss Duke explained that one of her main objectives is to promote a positive view of nurses.
