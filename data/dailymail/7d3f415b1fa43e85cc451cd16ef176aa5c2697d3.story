In what researchers are calling a breakthrough in cancer treatment, scientists in Adelaide have produced a new treatment strategy that sees cancer cells killing themselves.

Results of the study, published this week, found that after a short exposure to targeted therapy cancer cells decide to die, promising a new approach to fighting cancer.

'This discovery is paradigm shifting,' said Professor Deborah White, Director, Cancer Research with the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), who conducted the study with the University of Adelaide's Centre for Personalised Cancer Medicine.

'In our research, we're looking for methods that will result in the cancer cell killing itself. This would provide an improved treatment and reduce the risk of cancer relapse,' she said.

Lisa Schafranek, a PhD student at the University of Adelaide who is part of the research team, explains that unlike normal cells, which run their course and then die, cancer cells are not set up to die.

'The only way to get them to do that is by cutting off their survival messaging,' she told MailOnline.

There are methods of treatment that cut off survival messaging, however they have side effects, such as chemotherapy, which 'carpet-bombs all your cells'. This new development allows treatments to target particular cells.

'If we can find whatâ€™s specific about that cancer, we can spare the normal cells,' said Ms Schafranek.

Professor White says this treatment strategy might be effective in treating leukemia as well as reducing the side effects from chemotherapy and the need for ongoing treatment.

The study examined how blocking certain proteins might affect the death of cancerous cells, a subject that researchers said was 'poorly understood'.

The researchers found that blocking a protein named STAT5 proved lethal for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, and Professor White said the findings extend beyond CML to all targeted cancer treatments.

'The activity of STAT5 appears to be a critical determinant of the decision for cancer cells to live or die,' said Ms Schafranek.

'Our research has found that by blocking STAT5 in conjunction with exposure to a regular anti-cancer treatment, we were able to more effectively target the leukaemia cells. We now also better understand the timing required for the combined treatment to be effective.'

The results were published in the Leukemia journal.
