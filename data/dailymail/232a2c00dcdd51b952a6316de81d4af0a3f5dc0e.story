These pictures show hundreds of thousands of pounds of gold jewellery that police have recovered over the last six years.

The haul, which has been recovered from across London, has been valued at £510,000 and detectives are hoping to reunite the valuables with their owners.

There is an array of Asian gold rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches - many of which are believed to have been taken as a result of handbag thefts.

Asian gold jewellery is often bought as it is seen as the safest way to store wealth as it keeps its value better than property, currency and other investments.

Gold worth a total of £510,000 has been seized from thefts across London

Most of the gold is believed to have been taken from people's handbags

The pieces of jewellery have been snatched since 2007 and were seized by officers from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Detective Constable Stewart Walker said: 'It's an impressive haul which had been built up over many years through handbag thefts in the London area.

'We believe the hoard of gold was intended to be used by the offenders as a pension pot, allowing the criminals to continue to fund their lavish lifestyle for many years to come.

'We would now like to reunite as many items of jewellery with their rightful owners as possible.'

Thieves often take advantage of Asian households during religious celebrations when the jewellery is more likely to be out.

Tahir Maher, from Earley, Reading, last year spoke about the crime in the Thames Valley area. He said: 'I know someone who lost close to £50,000 of jewellery. Another lady whose only savings were her jewellery, went out shopping, came back and found she had lost everything.

Ornate necklaces, rings and bracelets were among the haul retrieved under the Proceeds of Crime Act

'With us it started during Ramadan when a lot of people were going to each others' houses to break the fast, and then going to prayers the houses were empty and it was a prime target for jewellery.

'People get dressed up for Eid or parties they are being invited to and put their jewellery on, so they get the jewellery out, you leave it about. The police said the thieves can go through your house in and out in 14 minutes.'

Thefts have increased as the price of gold has rocketed in recent years, going up as much as 14 per cent in 2011 to about £1,133 an ounce.

Although jewellery shops are supposed to keep a log of transactions and ask people selling gold for their ID, some unscrupulous ones do not follow the rules, according to DCI Brown.

He said: 'An unscrupulous jeweller can buy gold worth £20,000 for about £4,000 if it’s stolen.

Some gold has been returned but now police want to reunite the rest of the jewellery with its owners

Jewellers have also been the victims themselves of thieves, with attacks carried out on several of Slough’s 33 shops selling gold.

Another problem facing households with large amounts of valuable gold jewellery is the scarcity of deposit boxes in banks.

Coun Maher said 'When robberies were happening last summer gold was ridiculously high, my parents’ generation, any spare cash they had they would put into buying gold, and this would be an investment.

'One bank, when we pressurised them, allowed us a deposit box, but then it filled up within days.'
