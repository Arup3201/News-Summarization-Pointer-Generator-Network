Within moments of Prince George's latest photos appearing online, the tills at Cath Kidston were ringing as parents rushed to get hold of the 16-month-old's £32 tank top.

But as demand skyrocketed, the sailboat-emblazoned top soon sold out - leaving a crowd of frustrated mothers in its wake and gleeful fashion brand executives rushing through a fresh batch.

Now, the knitted tank tops have begun to appear on eBay but will cost would-be purchasers far more than they did in the shops.

Selling well: The sold-out Cath Kidston top has begun to appear on eBay for double the original price

Adorable: George wore the knitted tank top for his latest photos, which were released late on Saturday night

The most recent listing, which trumpets the top as being 'Worn By Prince George, has a starting bid of £25 but the sale is still three days away from finishing.

Another has attracted bids amounting to £55, while another, a larger version aimed at boys aged three to four, is currently listed at £35.

This is not the first time the Prince George effect has struck at a brand's bottom line. Although just 16-months-old, nearly everything the toddler wears sells out.

Indeed, within 48 hours of being carried from the Lindo Wing in a receiving blanket by Aden + Anais, the £44.95 wrap had sold out, while traffic to the brand's website shot up by 1,960 per cent.

And so it has continued, with French brand Petit Bateau benefiting when George wore its £27.50 striped sailcloth dungarees for his first birthday photo, and children's designer Rachel Riley enjoying a cash boost from his appearances during the Royal Tour Down Under.

Riley, who was almost unheard of until Prince George wore her sailboat smocked dungarees for a 'crawl-about' in New Zealand, credits the George effect with transforming her business.

'He is such a high profile baby and he’s brought lots of attention and excitement to the brand,' the London-based designer said in an interview with Forbes magazine.

'It’s been phenomenal for the business to have Prince George wearing pieces from the collection. Personally, as a British citizen, if there’s one child I’d want to dress it’s the heir to the throne. I’m absolutely thrilled.'

Others to benefit include little known Belgian label, Les Petit Abeilles whose white romper suit emblazoned with sailboats was worn as George arrived in Australia, and Spain's Neck & Neck whose website crashed after the baby royal was photographed in its pinstriped dungarees during a day out at the polo.

'Prince George wore the sailboat romper by Les Petites Abeilles on two occasions, at the Dukes arrival in New Zealand (with a white cardigan) and in Australia,' remembers Les Petit Abeilles founder, Désirée von Hohenlohe.

First hit: The George Effect came into being 48 hours after he was born when his white blanket sold out

'It was a great surprise and honour to see it worn by Prince George. We had a significant increase in sales afterwards and people emailed us from all over the world to order the romper.'

And it isn't just Les Petit Abeilles sales figures that have felt the Prince George effect. As Ms von Hohenlohe explains, the increased scrutiny has resulted in a makeover for the business itself.,

'We had the idea of developing our business by launching a web shop,' she explains. 'With all the publicity we received, we had to speed up setting the shop up.

'It also motivates us for our future projects. Now there are big expectations and people are following what we are doing. 

'A fashion magazine even contacted us to photo shoot of our autumn/winter collection; this has been very encouraging for us.'

Most of all though, Ms von Hohenlohe says she is thrilled by the simple fact that the Duchess of Cambridge liked her work enough to buy it for her baby son.

'We are of course thrilled with such an honour and we have great admiration for the royals,' she beams. 'The fact that they liked our sailboat romper means a lot to us, regardless of whether the current sailboat romper frenzy continue or not.

'We will always remember the moment we saw the little Prince wearing our romper, and the excitement we felt. We feel great about the fact that Les Petites Abeilles can dress little boys all over the world like little Princes.'

And dressing baby sons around the world is clearly popular - the young royal even has his own style blog, What Prince George Wore, dedicated to all things baby style.

The blog even has a sister site in the shape of What Kate Wore - a website devoted to the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe - although Prince William is yet to find similar favour with the fashion set.

But while the Duchess of Cambridge might still be a dab hand at selling out whatever she wears, even she cannot compete with her son when it comes to sheer selling power.

From £44.95 swaddling wraps to knitted tank tops, the George effect shows no sign of petering out - much to the excitement of childrenswear designers and eBay entrepreneurs contemplating another decade of buoyant sales to come.
