Carrying just four pounds too many can raise your risk of heart disease by a fifth

Carrying just four pounds too many can raise your risk of heart disease by a fifth, according to new research.

A large scale study found being overweight really does cause Britain’s biggest killer - as well as diabetes.

Alarmingly, an increase of only one unit of BMI (body mass index), equivalent to 4 to 12lbs depending on height, made the participants 20 per cent more likely to develop heart failure.

Meanwhile, obesity also led to higher levels of insulin, higher blood pressure, higher cholesterol and inflammation and more cases of diabetes.

Professor Erik Ingelsson, of Uppsala University, Sweden, said: ‘This knowledge is important, as it strengthens the evidence forceful societal measures need to be taken to counteract the epidemic of obesity and its consequences.’

His team used a new method to investigate the link between weight and cardiovascular disease because, despite previous evidence, it has not been clear whether too much fat was just a marker of another underlying cause.

The study, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, was an attempt to determine whether obesity as such is the actual cause or a signal of another lifestyle factor that triggers these diseases.

Dr Tove Fall, also of Uppsala University, said: ‘We knew already obesity and cardiovascular disease often occur together. However, it has been hard to determine whether increased BMI as such is dangerous.

‘In this study we found individuals with gene variants that lead to increased body-mass index (BMI) also had an increased risk of heart failure and diabetes. The risk of developing diabetes was greater than was previously thought.’

The researchers analysed whether a mutation in the FTO gene, which regulates the appetite and increases an individual’s BMI, was also linked to a series of cardiovascular diseases and metabolism.

This risk variant is common in the population, and each copy increases BMI by an average of between 0.3 and 0.4 points.

Since an individual’s genome is not affected by lifestyle and social factors, but rather is established at conception when the embryo randomly receives half of each parent’s genome, the method is called ‘Mendelian randomization’.

To achieve reliable results a large group was required, so almost 200,000 individuals from Europe and Australia were recruited.

Professor Ingelsson said: ‘Epidemiological studies look for associations in large populations, but it is usually difficult to reliably determine cause and effect - what we call causality.

‘By using this new genetic method, 
Mendelian randomization, in our research we can now confirm what many 
people have long believed, that increased BMI contributes to the 
development of heart failure. We also found that being overweight causes
increases in liver enzymes. This can lead to liver disease.’

An increase of only one unit of BMI, equivalent to between 4 and 12lbs depending on a person's height, makes a person 20 per cent more likely to develop heart failure

BMI
is calculated by taking your weight, in kilograms, and dividing it by 
your height squared, in metres, and is a way to compare the weights of 
groups of people of different heights.

Underweight is a BMI under 18.5, normal is between 18.5 and 25, between 25 and 30 is overweight and above 30 is obese.

Coronary heart disease causes about 82,000 deaths each year in the UK.

An estimated 70,000 to 75,000 people with diabetes die in England every year, accounting for about 15 per cent of all deaths.

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum and chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, described the findings as ‘very important’.

He said: ‘What is really exciting is they have pinned down causality, which is essential when coming up with any pronouncement like this.

‘It is not a totally new method, it has been around for about fifteen years, but the database is so large you can now say “hand on heart” being overweight causes heart failure. This is the final evidence.

‘Measuring BMI has been criticised as an inexact science, and has been rubbished, but if you monitored patients over a long period it could become extremely exact.

‘A BMI of 30 is obese, and if it then rises to 31, 32, 33, and 34 which is morbidly obese, if your risk of heart failure is going up by 20 per cent each time then you could be a goner.’
