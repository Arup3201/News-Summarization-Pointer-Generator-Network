When Misty the pit bull went missing, her owners used bacon to help the puppy - who was rescued from being used as bait by a dog-fighting ring - find her way home.

Misty had been missing since Friday, after slipping out of her collar as she played in the Riverdale, New Jersey garden of the woman who is fostering her while she waits for her forever home.

Erin Early-Hamilton, who has been fostering Misty, began a frantic search for the dog.  A $2,000 reward was offered to help track her down, hundreds of flyers were put up around the neighborhood and the nearby animal shelters and dog pounds were alerted.

A fundraiser to help pay for the search costs also attracted $4,570 in donations from concerned well-wishers, many of whom have watched the puppy's progress after she was found dumped on a Brooklyn street with appalling injuries.

However, nearly four days after she went missing, Misty followed her nose home after Mrs Early-Hamilton cooked up some bacon in the hope of attracting her.

Dogs have an incredible sense of smell and there are many cases of lost dogs being able to sniff their way back home or follow a strong scent.

Mrs Early-Hamilton, who is a vegan, 
was so worried about her missing dog that when someone suggested cooking
bacon in the garden, she jumped at the idea.

She had been sitting in a
chair with her hands on her head, when her husband, who was cooking up the bacon, told her their plan had worked.

'The whole thing is unbelievable,' Mrs Early-Hamilton said, as she recalled the moment the puppy wandered back into her garden.

'I screamed,' she told NJ.com. 'It was a 
yelp that just came out of me. It kind of made her jump back. But then 
she came right up to us, looking for bacon.'

Despite going missing on Friday afternoon, the puppy was in good health by the time she found her way home on Monday afternoon.

'It's amazing,' Jackie O'Sullivan, a partner at Second Chance Rescue, said.

It is thought Misty escaped after chasing after a bird.

'The area where she went is really, heavily wooded,' Ms O'Sullivan said during the search operation. 'We're just hoping she's hiding out or that someone might have her in their home already.'

Misty has a large fan base after the story of her rescue was widely reported. When she was taken in by Second Chance Rescue, she was covered in infected wounds and bite marks.

Ms O'Sullivan told the Daily News she hopes Misty's story will help raise awareness about the problems of illegal dog fighting.

Her plight touched the hearts of pupils at the Stephen Gaynor School in Manhattan, who raised $800 through cake sales to help with her treatment.

'Pit bulls are often victimized,' Dr. Kim Spanjol, the school's counselor, said. 'The kids want to do everything they can to show people that pit bulls are also sweet and loving dogs and Misty is a perfect example of that.'

Dog fighting is a felony offense, but the cruel 'sport' still takes place with street fights a particular problem in cities.

Breeds such as pit bulls are bred to be aggressive and weaker dogs, such as Misty, are often used to encourage the fighting dogs in training sessions.

As news that Misty was home and safe, more than 1,400 well-wishers from as far afield as Vancouver, California, Utah and Texas took to the Misty's Journey Facebook page to welcome her back.

In a message posted on her Facebook page, Misty's foster owner's announced the creation of Misty's Mission, Donations from the search fund will be used to set up the mission to pay for the treatment of the next dog saved from being used as bait in fighting.
