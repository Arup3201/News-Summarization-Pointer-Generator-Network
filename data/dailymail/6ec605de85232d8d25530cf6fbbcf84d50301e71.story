Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has demanded his team-mates show ‘personality’ to prevent their Champions League disaster against CSKA Moscow turning into a full-blown crisis.

Kompany watched in near disbelief as City had Fernandinho and Yaya Toure sent off in an embarrassing 2-1 defeat at an eerily quiet Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night. Once again, they gave a performance in Europe that was a far cry from their domestic form.

City are bottom of Group E and need maximum points from their remaining fixtures against Bayern Munich and Roma to stand any realistic chance of qualifying for the knockout stages.

Kompany has demanded his team-mates show 'personality' to avoid a Champions League disaster

‘Everyone will jump on the bandwagon, but I am going to go the other way and say I still believe in my team, and still back everyone at this club 100 per cent to turn it around,’ said Kompany.

‘But personality will have to show in the next games, otherwise we will have to wait another year.’

Unfortunately for City, a number of factors suggests just such a wait lies in store.

Manuel in a muddle

Manager Manuel Pellegrini was dignified post-match, refusing to blame referee Tasos Sidiropoulos for his team’s poor result. The Chilean knows City’s failings went beyond one hapless official and tactically he must accept blame. 

Allowing his team to be overrun in midfield was naive given that one key central player, Toure, is already a loose cannon when it comes to holding position and tracking back.

The plans against CSKA were a mess. Fernando was expected to stop Moscow’s counter-attacks almost single-handedly while Stevan Jovetic, Jesus Navas and Toure ineffectually stood by.

He sent on Fernandinho at half-time to rectify the problem but then gambled by taking Fernando off for Edin Dzeko — again leaving only one natural holder.

Fernandinho’s red card compounded the error.

Toure in turmoil

For so long an idol, Toure has developed into a caricature of a sulky footballer this season.

Already booked, his pointless shove on Roman Eremenko in the second half saw him get a straight red card and follow Fernandinho down the tunnel. It killed any City prospects of salvaging a draw. At least the Ivorian had the self-awareness to apologise.

There are mitigating factors. His younger brother died of cancer during the World Cup and the racial abuse he has received on Twitter is disturbing and unpleasant. 

Yaya Toure saw red for a shove on CSKA's Roman Eremenko to end hope of a fightback

Yet in this kind of form he is a liability. His lack of positional discipline and desire to track back made the job for central midfield partner Fernando impossible.

We never really got to the bottom of the birthday cake debacle, when Toure was allegedly seething that City’s Abu Dhabi owners hadn’t marked his birthday with due respect. The suspicion is that he was trying to engineer a move back to Barcelona. When Barca failed to show much interest, he pledged his loyalty to City rather unconvincingly.

Fans turning off

When City were struggling in the third tier of English football, their supporters were known as the best in the country. But now they are among Europe’s elite, there is a strange lethargy about big nights at the Etihad compared to Old Trafford or Anfield.

After seeing 10,000 seats go unused for their previous home game against Roma, City allowed fans to buy two-for-one against CSKA. It swelled the attendance but not the passion or atmosphere.The first half was observed in near silence until the team were jeered off at the interval when they were 2-1 down.

Clichy conundrum

Gael Clichy joined City from Arsenal, presumably for much higher wages. But some of his defending against CSKA was distracted to the point of being ridiculous. 

He conceded the free-kick that allowed Seydou Doumbia to head the opener for CSKA. Even worse, after Toure had equalised, Clichy hacked a simple pass across his own half straight to an opponent. Three touches later, Doumbia had restored Moscow’s lead.

Executive stress

They can’t avoid some degree of responsibility, from Sheik Mansour down. Their historic breaking of Financial Fair Play regulations means Pellegrini has been forced to pick a reduced squad for the Champions League.

Alvaro Negredo and John Guidetti have been loaned out because there is no room for them, leaving Pellegrini having to chase four trophies with just three strikers.

He has said Angel di Maria and Falcao were never options because City couldn’t afford the transfer fees or wages under the FFP restrictions.

The UEFA effect

Europe’s governing body might deny it but their rules have made it far more difficult for Manchester City to compete.

For City to be seeded lower than Arsenal, and therefore given a harder Champions League group, is ridiculous given that they won the Premier League and Arsenal finished fourth.

Their fans were banned from the away game in Moscow while CSKA supporters seemed to sneak in.

... on the bright side

City have been here before in both title-winning seasons. They were written off at stages in the season but dug in when nobody else believed and came out on top.With Bayern through, second spot is still up for grabs. Victory against the Germans would set up a likely winner-takes-all meeting away to Roma.
