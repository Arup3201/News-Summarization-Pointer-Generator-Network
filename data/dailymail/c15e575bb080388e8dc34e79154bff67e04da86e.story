David Cameron last night told the EU it had become ‘too big, too bossy and too interfering’ as he warned his fellow leaders not to ignore the Eurosceptic surge sweeping the continent.

The Prime Minister travelled to Brussels to demand the union be dramatically scaled back in the wake of election results in which millions expressed their disdain for the European project.

At dinner with the 27 other leaders, he warned them not to ‘shrug off’ the view of the European people that Brussels should hand back power to national governments. As well as Ukip topping the polls in Britain, anti-EU groups did well in countries from Germany to Greece.

More worryingly, the far-Right National Front took first place in France for the first time.Emboldened by the Eurosceptic surge, Mr Cameron vowed to do all he can to prevent arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker from getting the EU’s top job, President of the European Commission.

Mr Juncker is one of the most vocal supporters in the EU of the federalist dream of a United States of Europe.

Arriving in the Belgian capital after visiting a building site in London, Mr  Cameron said he would only support candidates who understood that the EU needed to change.

‘Europe cannot shrug off these results,’ he said. ‘We need an approach that recognises that Brussels has got too big, too bossy, too interfering.

He added: ‘It should be nation states wherever possible and Europe only where necessary.’ Mr Cameron has pledged an in/out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017 – after he has renegotiated the return of powers from Brussels.

Many of his backbenchers are concerned that the Ukip surge in the European elections mean he has not gone far enough for voters. Some are calling for a formal pact with Nigel Farage’s party for next year’s general election.

The Prime Minister believes he has built up an alliance of countries in opposition to the old idea of ever-closer European union – and European Parliament results will spook many leaders into joining him.

Mr Cameron said European leaders needed to appoint a new EU President who wanted to scale back Brussels power - not increase it

He spoke to France’s President Hollande yesterday morning to urge him to come on board.

Mr Cameron is understood to be emboldened by his TV address on Sunday night, in which he called for the EU to ‘reform’.

The Prime Minister also held a phone conversation with German chancellor Angela Merkel. But in a blow to the PM, she yesterday said her party was still supporting Mr Juncker.

He may also seek the support of Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, whose father-in-law is Neil Kinnock, and who famously joined Mr Cameron and Barack Obama for a ‘selfie’ at Nelson Mandela’s funeral.

She may be moved by the strong showing of the far-Right Danish People’s Party in the European elections, as they won 27 per cent of the vote and doubled their number of MEPs.

Mr Juncker is the candidate of the European People’s Party.

The present President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, will step down towards the end of the year.

The decision of who will succeed him is likely to be put off until late June.

Douglas Alexander, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman, said: ‘Mr Cameron seems either unwilling or unable to set out what changes  he wants to see at an EU level.’
