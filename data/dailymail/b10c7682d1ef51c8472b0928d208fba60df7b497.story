It looks like any recession-hit high street, with a ladies’ hair salon, a cut-price TV store and, in between, a disused kebab shop.

But secreted above the shuttered premises that once sold Middle Eastern food is an altogether different import from the Arab world.

The cramped flat in Cricklewood, North West London, is now the centre of operations for Egypt’s once-mighty Muslim Brotherhood.

The Muslim Brotherhood are reported to have set up their new headquarters above a disused kebab shop on Cricklewood high-street

It is from here that the 
controversial Islamist organisation, expelled from power in a bloody 
military coup in Cairo, is plotting its comeback.

The
 Brotherhood’s leader, deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, is in 
jail following last July’s coup in which more than 1,000 died in street 
clashes. But it still has the support of millions across the Arab world 
and has been given shelter on Cricklewood Broadway by an Islamic 
charity.

President Mohamed Morsi faces trial for alleged treason after being forced from office, but his supporters are plotting a fightback from their London office

Yesterday, a 
Brotherhood official denied it was using the down-at-heel premises. The 
man, who would not give his name, told the Daily Mail: ‘This is the 
offices of a legitimate business and nothing more.’

But
 Mohamed Ghanem, 68, the expatriate Egyptian who has run the non-profit 
World Media Services for more than 20 years, confirmed: ‘This is an 
Islamic charity and we have same values of the Muslim Brotherhood. So 
when their members had to leave Egypt, we helped them.’

Regulars
 at an Algerian cafe across the road are in no doubt that the flat is 
the organisation’s command centre. One said: ‘The Muslim Brotherhood 
have been there for just under a year.

The
 leaders come and go throughout the day and the evening. Sometimes you 
see them coming out with Muslim Brotherhood banners, on their way to 
demonstrations.’

The HQ is 
run by relatives of two Morsi aides who were arrested with him. One 
official, who asked to remain anonymous, said London was ‘the capital of
 a free democracy that values human rights and social justice’.

Another
 said: ‘We look forward to seeing those values brought back to Egypt 
once our democracy is restored and our freedom from dictatorship and 
repression won.’ 

Muslim 
Brotherhood official Ibrahim Mounir, who is based in the UK, says that 
while the organisation’s highest orders still come from Cairo, the 
London office is a hub where members can meet in safety.

‘It is our objective that the coup leaders are held accountable for their atrocities,’ he said.

Founded in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood advocates Sharia law and rejects Western values.

It made its name fighting British rule in Egypt and was linked to the 1981 assassination of President Sadat.

It won the elections following the 2011 Egyptian revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak.

Mr
 Morsi became Egypt’s first democratically-elected president, only to be
 ousted by the coup after the Brotherhood’s disastrous rule left Egypt 
divided and close to ruin.
