Jacky Lo posted pics of his dog being washed in a washing machine cycle on his Facebook page

Distressing images of a puppy dog almost drowning in a washing machine cycle has sparked outrage in Hong Kong

A teenage boy, named Jacky Lo, posted the shocking pictures of the small dog struggling in the churning water on his Facebook page with a comment boasting about how efficient the method had been to clean his pet.

He then went on to joke that the cute canine, believed to be a white West Highland terrier, had not survived the terrifying incident but one of photos showed the dog made it through the wash cycle – albeit sopping wet and stunned.

The brazen images have led to an online petition and a police investigation into the incident.

Lo wrote the following comment when posting the pictures: 'A super quick way to wash a dog: soak, clean, and dry. All done. Clean and quick!' with a smiley icon and the words 'feeling content' reports South China Morning Post.

When someone  asked if the pup had died, Lo replied with: 'Yes, wanna see it?'

An online petition was started on the You Sign Animals website which saw 19,000 people putting their name to the cause which called on authorities to investigate the matter.

'Although Hong Kong might not be known for its animal welfare laws, this is just unacceptable,' the site said.

'Authorities cannot turn a blind eye on this. Let's convince authorities they need to look into it and have this man brought to justice.'

Lo's Facebook profile has since been taken down but the petition page revealed more of the conversation Lo had with people about the picture he posted.

A Facebook user, named Agnes replied, that this was one way for Lo to get famous and then asked if he did not perceive the stunt as an act of animal cruelty.

'I don't care what you guys are going to do! Do I look afraid of you guys?' Lo posted. 'I don't even think animal cruelty is a problem, not to mention cats and dogs!'

His comments started a tirade of abuse towards Lo from social media users who labelled him 'sick', 'scum', 'a weak bully', 'shameless' and 'a monster'.

Authorities have since stepped in to investigate the matter but Lo gloated on Saturday that he was leaving Hong Kong to go back to the mainland, the South China Morning Post reported.

The post included a link to the online petition urging the police to bring him to justice, with Lo commenting: 'Wanted?? This afternoon I'm going back to China. See ya later.'

SPCA spokeswoman Rebecca Ngan said people began contacting the SPCA after the pictures began circulating on Thursday afternoon.

'We received about 50 emails overnight from people who were very concerned,' she said. 

'Obviously, even if the dog is not dead, to put a dog in a washing machine would still be cruelty.'
