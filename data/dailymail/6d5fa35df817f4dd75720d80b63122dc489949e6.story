A young groom's family are demanding that his bride gives them back their $500,000 'dowry' after she reportedly left him for always siding with his mother.

Shakiba Banifatemi, an exchange student from Iran, and Reza Abdollahpour, a Canadian from an Iranian family, met in calculus class at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and married a year later, on April Fool's Day in 2012.

Banifatemi moved in with her new husband's parents - but 18 months later, she could no longer bear to live with her mother-in-law, her lawyer told the Toronto Star.

She left him in December 2013 and he filed for divorce in January 2014.

Before their wedding, the groom's family had given his bride half ownership of a $1 million home in Ottawa. Such dowries are in keeping with Iranian tradition, the paper reported.

The Abdollahpour family, which owns a jewelry business in Ottawa, demanded that Banifatemi give the dowry back in light of the failed marriage.

But last week a judge dismissed the Abdollahpours' claims for the courts to order that she hand over her share of property, as well as the cost of the wedding - around $50,000 - and wedding gifts.

The family claims that the young bride 'acted fraudulently by tricking' them into handing over part of the property and getting Abdollahpour to sponsor her for her residency.

They also claimed that Banifatemi's father had promised to hand back wedding gifts if she left the marriage 'or acted inappropriately' towards her new husband, the Star reported.

But the judge, Justice Robert Smith, disputed the claims. 

'The gift was made without any expectation of remuneration but with the expectation that Shakiba would marry Ahmad, which occurred,' Smith said.

'The parties entered into a valid marriage, which was consummated, and they lived together as man and wife for approximately one year and a half.'

He added that Banifatemi's older brother also lives in Ottawa so could have sponsored her for residency, rather than her needing to turn to her boyfriend. 

Banifatemi's lawyer, Kevin Kavanagh, added: 'She married him in good faith and that's what the court found. Sometimes things don't work out, unfortunately, but you can't go back a year and half or two years later and allege that there was fraudulent intent.'

Banifatemi, who still lives in Canada, told the Star she is 'pleased' with the decision.

Her lawyer said that Banifatemi didn't want to leave the marriage and still loved her husband but could no longer live with her mother-in-law.

But Abdollahpour and his mother, Sima, denied the claims and Sima said that she had a 'beautiful relationship' with her daughter-in-law.

Of his ex-wife, Reza Abdollahpour added: 'I prefer to think that she's non-existent.'

He added that in Iranian culture, the dowry is supposed to be returned if a wife leaves her husband. 

The family does not yet know if they'll appeal the judge's decision.
