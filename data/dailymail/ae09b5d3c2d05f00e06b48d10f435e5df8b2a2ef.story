Currency trader Joe Lewis, 59 (pictured), is under investigation after almost £128million reportedly disappeared from the accounts of his clients

A currency trader who is being investigated by police over fraud claims has vanished along with almost £130million of investors' cash, it has emerged.

Joe Lewis, 59, is under investigation after the money reportedly disappeared from the accounts of his clients, who are said to include a host of wealthy British investors including professional footballers and golfers.

The whereabouts of Lewis, who traded from a luxury apartment overlooking the Bosphorus in Istanbul, is currently unknown after he apparently fled the Turkish city.

In an email sent to investors nearly two weeks ago, Lewis apparently admitted that his company – JL Trading – had not been running since 2009 after suffering 'substantial' losses.

In the email dated December 3, he apparently confessed that he had continued taking his clients' money for five years in an attempt to turn around his fortunes following losses on foreign exchange deals.

According to The Telegraph, he wrote: 'Dear investor, I am writing to inform you that JL Trading is ceasing to carry on business. Contrary to the impression that I have hitherto given, the business has lost almost all of its assets, and there appears no prospect of those assets being recouped.

'JL Trading ceased foreign exchange trading in 2009 following substantial losses and since that time the business has suffered further losses, which I have tried to make good through investments in a number of commercial projects. 

'However, it is now clear that the business will not be able to recover its losses and must cease trading. This means that, contrary to what was reported to you previously, you cannot expect any payments in the future.

'I can only apologise unreservedly for any losses or unfulfilled expectations of profit. I have tried to recover the position for a considerable period of time, but it is now clear that I will be unable to do so. 

'I sincerely regret that I have not been able to do better on your behalf.'

The currency trader's JL Trading website currently has a message which says it is 'no longer trading' (above)

It was followed up by an email two days later, the last to be received from him, in which he blamed the comments on his legal team.

He said: 'You have been sent an update this week which was worded by my lawyers, but I wanted everyone to know, I am not running away from things. While I regret some of the things I have done, I will do my best to remedy this situation.

'Please note, I have covered up my mistakes from everyone including my staff, no one else knew what was happening.'

In an earlier email, sent on November 14, he also reportedly claimed his company was having a 'stressful time' releasing £126million ($197million) from American brokers.

The father of two attracted investors via word of mouth and promised monthly returns of between one and three per cent, as well as luxury golf days out.

Since 2011, he has reportedly insisted that investors have a minimum of £16,000 readily-available.

Don Wall, a retired businessman from Cambridgeshire, claims to be owed about £100,000 by JL Trading.

The 77-year-old told The Telegraph: 'This money was supposed to be savings for my children and grandchildren. I have never met the bloke and I don't think I have ever spoken to him.'

He invested £10,000 in 2009 before withdrawing £7,000 and later pumping a further £100,000 into the fund. He has now reported Lewis to police.

Mark Bavin, who introduced Mr Wall and others to the scheme, has also reported Lewis.

Mr Bavin said he was 'sure it was a massive fraud' and claims to be owed 'significant' sums by Lewis.

The whereabouts of Joe Lewis, who traded from a luxury apartment overlooking the Bosphorus in Istanbul (pictured), is currently unknown after he apparently fled the Turkish city. He has not been heard from since

Other alleged victims claim to have started legal proceedings against Lewis, which has apparently led to his bank accounts and assets being frozen. 

Lewis was unavailable for comment when approached by The Telegraph but his son told the newspaper: 'I don't know where the money's gone. I am happy to share information with the legal entities.

'Everything he had is ruined. There are no assets at all that I am aware of.' 

Forex Fraud, an organisation set up to help prevent Forex scam and commodity fraud, said it 'advises caution' on using the broker, who operates under the name of Joe Lewis Trading.

The JL Trading website is currently withdrawn and a message has replaced the homepage informing visitors that the firm is 'no longer trading'.

MailOnline has contacted JL Trading for comment.
