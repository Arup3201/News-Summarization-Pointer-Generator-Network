Golf's bad boy Dustin Johnson is hitting back against claims he was suspended twice for cocaine - claiming he doesn't have a drug problem. 

Even so, the 30-year-old jet-setter admits he partied too hard in the past and he's turning over a new leaf before his fiancée Paulina Gretzky gives birth to the couple's first child next month.

Paulina revealed on Christmas Day on her Instagram that she's having a boy.

Back in action: Dustin Johnson has been on an inexplicable five-month hiatus from the PGA Tour after he was rumored to have been suspended over drug use - something he denies

Johnson gave an extended interview to Golf.com in which he admitted he's working to clean up his act and 'simplify' his life since leaving the PGA Tour five months ago. 

He says he's been spending a great deal of time with Paulina's father - NHL legend Wayne Gretzky - who lives just half a mile down the road from Johnson's home on the Sherwood Country Club. 

Gretzky has been coaching Johnson, a kid from a divorced family in South Carolina, on how to cope with his fame and fortune - he's made more than $25million off PGA Tour wins alone. 

Golf.com previously reported that Johnson was disciplined three times by the PGA - twice for testing positive for cocaine and once for marijuana. The site reported that he is serving a six-month suspension from the PGA Tour as a result of his last drug test.

When asked about the allegations, Johnson flatly denied them. 

'I did not have a problem. It’s just something I’m not going to get into. I have issues. But that’s not the issue,' he said.  

Paulina is due next month. The 25-year-old model has been dealing with pregnancy cravings - for celery, Johnson reveals

 However, he admitted to drinking too much. His booze of choice - Grey Goose and soda with lime. 

 'I don’t miss waking up with a hangover, and I didn’t drink very often. It was just when I did it was a little too much,' he told Golf.com. 

The talented golfer also denied reports that he had been to rehab - saying he hired a 'life coach' and a team of clinicians to hep him 'simplify' his life. However, he said he never underwent treatment for any addiction.

Johnson revealed he's abstained from booze for January - ponying up $1,000 with Wayne Gretzky and several friends from the Sherwood Country Club as part of a bet to stay off alcohol for a month.

He claims he's also selling his two Jet Skis, one of his boats and his $300,000 Aston Martin. He gave his souped-up 1976 Pontiac to his brother - all in an attempt to rid himself of distractions. 

Johnson says he plans to end his golf hiatus and return to the PGA Tour either at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, California, on February 5, or the following week at Pebble Beach.

The golf schedule depends on when Paulina gives birth.

For now, he says, he's spending his time working out and taking care of Paulina's pregnancy cravings. The 25-year-old model's most common demand? Celery.
