Borussia Dortmund slumped to their fourth successive Bundesliga defeat and their fifth failure in six games at home to fellow strugglers Hannover 96 on Saturday. 

A Hiroshi Kiyotake free kick was enough to clinch the result for the visitors at Signal Iduna Park despite Dortmund dominating the majority of the match on the back of their 4-0 demolition of Galatasaray in the Champions League mid-week.

Ron-Robert Zieler was busy in Hannover's goal but was up the challenge and proved instrumental in relegating Dortmund to a shock 15th out of 18 teams in Germany's top league with just seven points.

Under-pressure boss Jurgen Klopp's side had no shortage of chances with the best a header from Mats Hummels tipped onto the bar by Zieler.   

Marco Reus squandered a number of good chances to take the lead in the second half with Zieler again called upon. 

But against the run of play Kiyotake was given an opportunity from 25 yards on the hour mark and took it with open arms, curling the winner into the corner.

The strike was Hannover's first away goal of the season and puts them a point adrift of 2011 and 2012 champions Dortmund in the relegation zone.

The Japanese international could have had a second soon after when he got in behind the Dortmund defence and forced a quality save from Roman Weidenfeller.

Klopp introduced Shinji Kagawa with 20 minutes to go as they continued to press but an equaliser didn't come.  

Hannover had Ceyhun Gulselam sent off a minute from time but will be keener to focus on ending their own run of three straight defeats in the league.
