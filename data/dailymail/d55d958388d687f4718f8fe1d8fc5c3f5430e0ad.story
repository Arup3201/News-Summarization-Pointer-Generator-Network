In a victory for affirmative action opponents, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Abigail Fisher in a case that alleged the University of Texas at Austin rejected her application in favor of minority applicants with similar grades and test scores.

The court sent the case back to a lower court for another look.

The court's 7-1 decision in Fisher v. University of Texas Monday was a blow to advocates of the 35-year-old law that boosts college admissions of African Americans and other minorities.

'I was devastated,' she said to the press four years after her rejection from the selective, highly regarded university.

'I probably would have gotten a better job offer had I gone to U.T.,' she told the New York Times.

Another factor fueling Fisher's lawsuit 
was that the university has produced diversity by 
automatically offering about three-quarters of its spots to graduates in
the top 10 percent of their Texas high schools, under a 1990s state law
signed by then-Gov. George W. Bush.

Acting firmly: Fisher maintains she was passed over for minority students who performed as well or not as well as she did in high school by UT Austin admissions

The landmark Fisher v. UT Austin case was only one among several groundbreaking cases that SCOTUS has decided this week. Some decisions have been announced, while others are still to come, including the long-awaited DOMA and Prop 8 same-sex marriage cases.

TODAY'S DECISIONS

Vance v. Ball State University: The court ruled in favor of Ball State, making it harder for employees to sue employers for harassment because it ruled a person must be able to hire and fire someone to be considered a supervisor in such suits.

US v. Kebodeaux: Ruled that sex offenders may still be listed on sex offender registries even if they completed their sentences before the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act came into law.

University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar: Decided for the university, ruling that an employee who claims harassment and complains of subsequent punishment must show the punishment would not have occurred if not for the complaint.

Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett: Decided for the pharma company, not the woman whose skin fell off after using their drug, and ruled that federal law trumps state law in cases of the adequacy of drug warning labels.

SOME RULINGS TO COME

Windsor v. US: This is the Defense of Marriage Act case. DOMA defines marriage as between one man and one woman at the federal level and opponents believe it's unconstitutional.

Hollingsworth v. Perry: This is the case that will decide the constitutionality of California's 2008 voter-passed Proposition 8 that banned same-sex marriageÂ 

Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder: Current law lets the federal government monitor voting in areas with a history of discrimination. Opponents seek to strike down that aspect of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

That includes schools where the top level of achievement could be significantly lower than at higher-performing schools.

It also includes schools where the student demographics skew toward minorities.

Fisher was a good student who played on the soccer team and graduated with a 3.59 grade point average.

She graduated 82nd in a class of 674, which put her close to the top 10 percent but not quite close enough, reports Business Insider.

The admissions program has been 
changed so that now only the top 8 percent gain automatic admission.

According to Fisher, minorities who 
graduated below her and who participated less in extracurricular 
activities at her high school were accepted to the flagship University of Texas system school.

Justice Kennedy wrote for the 7 to 1 
majority. He said the New Orleans appeals court that sided with Texas 
originally did not scrutinize the case sufficiently enough and in 
accordance with the Supreme Court's 2003 upholding of affirmative 
action.

Justice Elena Kagan stayed out of the 
case, presumably because she had some contact with it at an earlier 
stage when she worked in the Justice Department.

The compromise ruling throws out the 
decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 
which upheld the Texas admission plan.

More than 8 in 10 African-American 
and Latino students who enrolled at the flagship campus in Austin in 
2011 were automatically admitted, according to university statistics. 
Even among the rest, both sides acknowledge that the use of race is 
modest.

In all, black and Hispanic students made up more than a quarter of the incoming freshmen class.

White
students constituted less than half the entering class when students 
with Asian backgrounds and other minorities were added in.

Texas argued that race is one of many
factors considered and that whether race played the key role in any 
applicant's case was impossible to tell.

The
Obama administration, roughly half of the Fortune 100 companies and 
large numbers of public and private colleges that feared a broad ruling 
against affirmative action backed the Texas program.

Among
the benefits of affirmative action, the administration said, is that it
creates a pipeline for a diverse officer corps that it called 
'essential to the military's operational readiness.'
