Scientists analysing the surface of a giant asteroid are puzzling over bright spots that represent some of the purest materials seen so far by a Nasa spacecraft.

Nasa released new images of the asteroid Vesta taken by the orbiting Dawn spacecraft that show some places on the surface twice as bright as others.

Vesta is one of the brightest objects in the solar system and the only asteroid in the so-called main belt between Mars and Jupiter visible to the naked eye from Earth.

The bright material, found mostly around craters, appeared as a result of rocks slamming into the surface and exposing it.

Researchers are still trying to determine what it is made of but believe it is pristine and unchanged from the asteroid's formation some four billion years ago.

‘Our analysis finds this bright material originates from Vesta and has undergone little change since the formation of Vesta over four billion years ago,’ said Jian-Yang Li, a Dawn participating scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park. ‘We're eager to learn more about what minerals make up this material and how the present Vesta surface came to be.’

The bright areas vary from several hundred feet to around 10 miles across.

There are also a wide variety of distinct dark deposits across its surface.

The dark materials on Vesta can appear dark grey, brown and red. They sometimes appear as small, well-defined deposits around impact craters.

They also can appear as larger regional deposits, like those surrounding the impact craters scientists have nicknamed the ‘snowman.’

‘One of the surprises was the dark material is not randomly distributed,’ said David Williams, a Dawn participating scientist at Arizona State University. ‘This suggests underlying geology determines where it occurs.’

The dark materials seem to be related to impacts and their aftermath. Scientists theorise carbon-rich asteroids could have hit Vesta at speeds low enough to produce some of the smaller deposits without blasting away the surface.

Dawn has been studying Vesta since it entered orbit last year.

The spacecraft is set to depart Vesta this summer and cruise to another asteroid, Ceres, arriving in 2015.
