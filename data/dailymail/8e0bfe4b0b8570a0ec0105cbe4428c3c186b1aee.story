The air passengers of the future will be able to see the sights of the world without even stepping off the plane.

Airbus has filed for a US Patent for a new smart aircraft which is set to revolutionise the travel industry, with sweeping windows and interactive glass so passengers can learn about the sights they see below.

The patent, filed on March 19, features touchscreen windows for passengers so they can tap key attractions as they fly overhead and find out what they are.

Airbus have filed for a patent for interactive windows, so guests can select landmarks, such as the London Eye, and learn more about how it built

Airbus hope their plans with provide a 'method for interactive visualization of information in an aircraft cabin'

According to Skift, The high-tech windows are described as  a 'method for interactive visualization of information in an aircraft cabin.'

The vision is to create an aircraft with plenty of light and opportunity for enjoying the skies. 

Images released by Airbus show the planes will be kitted out with seemingly transparent walls, which will in turn be fitted with touchscreen technology.

Passengers will have plenty of room to stretch out while enjoying the views, with chairs that allow for greater recline and leg space.

Great view! Find out exactly what you are looking at, as you soar over cities on your travels 

Plans include increased space, and window sizes for passengers to enjoy their flight

The patent comes after Airbus shared plans for a concept plane with panoramic windows stretching up onto the roof of the aircraft.

The concept cabin would be a bionic structure that 'mimics' the efficiency of bird bone, claim Airbus.

It would provide strength where needed, and also allows for an 'intelligent' cabin wall membrane which controls air temperature and can become transparent to give passengers open, panoramic views. 

The plane of the future would also replace first, business and economy cabins with zones for relaxation in the front, work in the back, and a fully-stocked bar for socialising.  

And the aircraft's walls would change according to light conditions, with holographic pop-up gaming displays and in-flight entertainment powered by the heat of passengers' bodies. 

Aircraft pictures show plans with increased window size, and a departure from the usual small oval windows
