Chelsea youngster Marco van Ginkel has completed a season-long loan deal to AC Milan, following in the footsteps on Fernando Torres.

Dutch midfielder Van Ginkel spent the majority of his first campaign at Stamford Bridge recovering from a cruciate ligament injury with Jose Mourinho eager for him to gain first-team experience.

The deal solves Chelsea's conundrum of having too many foreign players to comply with Premier League and Champions League squad regulations.

Long-serving keeper Petr Cech had been tipped to make way to comply to the quota, having lost his place to Thibaut Courtois.

Van Ginkel revealed his delight at arriving at the San Siro: 'I am very happy. Milan is a great club where many Dutch players have played and some big names.

'I know Nigel De Jong from my experiences with the National team, I spoke to him about Milan and he said excellent things about the club. I will see him soon. I am a midfielder that defends but I also know how to score goals.

Problem solved: Jose Mourinho (right) no longer needs to move on a foreign player after Van Ginkel's move

'I play all across the park. I want to become an important member of the squad, I am a team player and I want to meet the coach. Like I said before, I am happy to be here. I want to get game time and I think that I will have the chance to play at Milan in a great league against strong sides.

'This is the objective for the season. I haven’t as yet spoken to coach Inzaghi but I have spoken to Fernando Torres this week. He’s a good lad.'
