The mistress of French president Francois Hollande was today nominated for a French Oscar – for playing a sex obsessed government aide.

News of Julie Gayet’s success comes as the Socialist head of state visits Prime Minister David Cameron in Britain.

Mr Hollande, 59, had been hoping to avoid questions about his colourful private life, but Ms Gayet’s increasing fame will make them inevitable.

The 41-year-old is nominated for a so-called Cesar, the highest honour in French cinema, for best supporting actress in ‘Quai d’Orsay’.

The soap opera is named after the Paris quay where France’s foreign ministry is based, and Ms Gayet plays a mini-skirted adviser who uses her feminine charms to bed powerful men.

In real life, Ms Gayet is said to have been having a passionate affair with Mr Hollande while he was still living with his ex first lady, Valerie Trierweiler.The two secret lovers regularly met in a Paris flat, with Mr Hollande arriving on the back of a motor bike with his head hidden by a crash helmet.

Such revelations will overshadow Mr Hollande’s first Anglo-French summit, to be held at Brize Norton airfield in Oxfordshire, and a nearby pub.

It came as a new poll Harris Interactive poll found 64 per cent of French police did not think Mr Hollande struck ‘the right tone’ in the way he effectively ‘fired’ Ms Trierweiler.

Mr Hollande released an 18 word statement last Saturday confirming that he was no longer living with his 48-year-old ex-girlfriend, meaning she lost her role and all its perks.

There were no plans to bring Ms Gayet to the UK today, as Mr Hollande prepared to be grilled at morning press conference.

His talks with Mr Cameron will cover defence, European Union reform, Libya and the Syrian civil war.

Mr Hollande has so far hidden behind France’s privacy laws, continually arguing that the status of France’s taxpayer funded first lady is nobody’s business but his own.

Mr Hollande has also been widely criticised for using Elysee staff to organise his secret visits to Ms Gayet in a Paris love nest, to which he travelled on the back of a moped with his face hidden by a crash helmet.

Today’s poll is in Closer, the magazine which exposed his cheating with a series of photographs of him visiting Ms Gayet.

Ms Trierweiler, a Paris match journalist, has meanwhile already offered long interviews to a series of glossy magazines, and is set to write a lucrative book about her 19 months as first lady.
