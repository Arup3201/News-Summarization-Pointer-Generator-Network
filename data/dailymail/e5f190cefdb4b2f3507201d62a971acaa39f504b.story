The body of an infant has been found at a Southern California trash recycling center.

Sheriff's deputies were called to Advance Disposal Co. in the high desert city of Hesperia, in San Bernardino County, shortly after 8am Wednesday.

The body was that of a little girl and was found in a pile of garbage on a conveyer belt, according to NBC Los Angeles. 

Sheriff's spokeswoman Jodi Miller tells KNBC-TV that investigators would like to hear from anyone who knows of a pregnant woman who recently gave birth without going to a hospital.

Scene: 

Homicide detectives were at the scene on Wednesday searching for anything that could link them to the child's mother.

The recycling business services Hesperia and county areas, according to its website 

The Victor Valley Daily Press reports that last October an infant's body was found at a recycling center in Victorville, just north of Hesperia.

Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives, meanwhile, are investigating human remains found Monday night on a conveyor belt at a trash facility in Bassett, where other bodies have turned up in recent years.
