A bumper crop of new potatoes has left growers in Jersey with a bumper problem – their spuds are too big for fussy British consumers.

A combination of rain, sun and mild temperatures created perfect growing conditions. But as a result, many are larger than the ideal size of 2.5cm to 5cm – with some twice as big.

Supermarkets are refusing to buy them and frustrated farmers are having to give tons of cast-offs to charity or leave them rotting in the fields.

Waste: Good growing conditions has meant this year's crop of Jersey Royals have grown larger than usual. Now, piles of the potatoes are going to waste, pictured, because supermarkets won't by the bigger spuds

Tim Ward, sales and distribution director at Albert Bartlett potatoes, said his firm aims to produce potatoes no bigger than 50mm in diameter.

He said any larger and customers gripe about having to slice them into pieces to cook them.

He said: 'We’re producing plenty of potatoes the right size but a good percentage have gone beyond that.

'The quality is exceptional but sadly people don’t want new potatoes the size of baking potatoes.

'There is high wastage. Some of it gets returned to fields and a small amount for dairy fodder. There isn’t a lot we can do with it.'

Mr Ward said the problem was being exacerbated by a huge surplus of potatoes across Europe and the rest of the UK, which has also enjoyed perfect growing conditions.

The massive crop is in stark contrast to last year, when snow, frost and rain caused major delays to the Jersey Royal season and led to 10,000 tonnes fewer being exported.

The crop was still worth £30m to the island in exports last year, however, in spite of the setbacks.Mr Ward said: 'This has been the best growing season since 1997, when they generated 58,000 tonnes of crop.

'It’s been incredible and there has been nothing to stop the crop growing.

'Normally you’d get frost or north-easterly winds or really wet or really dry weather, but we’ve had a perfect growing season.

This year has been the best growing year for the Jersey Royal since 1997 - when 58,000 tonnes of the potato were exported from the Channel Island.

This year, thanks to excellent growing conditions, the average potato plant has produced 10 to 12 potatoes - compared to four to six normally.

Producers do not like to sell potatoes of over 55mm in diameter to the supermarkets - as then customers are more likely to have to chop them up in order to cook them properly.

The crop accounts for around 70 per cent of the island's agricultural turnover - with 99 per cent of produce exported to the UK.

Up to 1,500 tonnes of potatoes are exported from Jersey during peak season - which usually falls in May.

'It has meant a bumper crop but unfortunately it hasn’t just been confined to Jersey - the whole of Europe has experienced the same and there are potatoes coming from every conceivable area.'

William Church, director of sales and marketing at the Jersey Royal Company, said his firm is experiencing a similar problem, with his potatoes growing so large that up to 50 percent could be wasted.

He said: 'Last year each plant was producing between four and six potatoes but this year plants are producing between 10 and 12.

'It’s been a little bit of rain, little bit of warmth, no frost or harsh winds so the quality and availability has been fantastic.

'This time last year, the crops were really hammered by weather conditions - we’ve gone from chalk to cheese.

'We have a lot of competition coming in from the markets and there are a huge amount of English potatoes also being offered.'

Jersey Royals account for around 70 percent of Jersey’s annual agricultural turnover and 99 percent of the channel island’s production is exported to the UK.

The peak of the season is May, when up to 1,500 tonnes of Royals can be exported daily.

The kidney-shaped spuds enjoys the same EU designation of origin protection as Champagne, Stilton cheese and Cumberland sausages.

Means piles of potatoes are being left in fields to rot and are going to waste
