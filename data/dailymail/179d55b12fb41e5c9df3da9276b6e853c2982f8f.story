Former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester received a £1million payout from the bailed-out bank earlier this year

Former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester faces a fresh political row over his pay after it emerged he received a £1million payout from the bailed-out bank earlier this year.

The news came just days after the bank was fined £400 million for rigging foreign exchange markets between 2008 and 2013 – the period during which he was at the helm.

The pay committee at RBS, which is 79 per cent owned by the Treasury, approved an award of around 250,000 shares in the bank in March as part of a long-term incentive plan. 

Although part of an existing scheme, it could have withheld the shares. RBS was one of five banks fined by the Financial Conduct Authority and US regulators after it was found a network of traders had colluded to manipulate currency markets.

RBS and Hester are no strangers to political rows over pay. Earlier this year Chancellor George Osborne was forced to prevent the bank from paying its top bankers bonuses worth twice their salary, while in 2012 Hester was forced to give up a £963,000 bonus.

Hester, whose mansion in Oxfordshire is thought to be worth more than £7 million, was ousted from his role in June 2013. He now runs insurance giant RSA, owners of MoreThan.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘The banks have paid large fines, but people are fed up with the fact that the bankers who have caused so much damage to our economy through their reckless behaviour can break the law and get away scot-free.

'As well as the new management taking back the bonuses of those responsible, prosecutors must look hard at whether criminal action against former senior managers and directors can also be obtained, so wrongdoers can be brought to justice.’

There is no suggestion that Hester was aware of any wrongdoing until official investigations began.

Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Chris Leslie, said: ‘It will take a lot to convince me this scale of awards is truly justified.

The pay committee at RBS, which is 79 per cent owned by the Treasury, approved an award of around 250,000 shares

‘If we have moved to long-term bonuses that can be clawed back then that has to bite if we discover misbehaviour.’

Mark Garnier, Conservative MP for Wyre Forest and a member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said: ‘We have to make these people get it that they are responsible for these organisations. 

'They are in a position to set in place mechanisms and reporting lines that means if they can’t know every single transaction, they can make sure things have been done properly.’

It was unclear last night if the Chancellor was informed by RBS that it had made the award. RBS and Hester both declined to comment.
