They described how he 'loved' spending time fishing and working with animals, which he was able to do as a student at Brymore, a state boarding school which has a substantial farm attached.

A statement from his family said: 'Jake was a much-loved son, brother to five sisters, grandson and nephew who will be missed terribly by all his family and friends'.

'He was studying at Brymore College, a place he loved, and hoped, one day, to have a career in agriculture that would allow him to work with tractors - which he also loved.

'Jake was a quiet boy, a mature and thoughtful son, who adored his animals and loved to go fishing.

'This is an extremely difficult time for us and, whilst we are touched by the kind messages and support we have received, we ask that our privacy be respected and we are given time and space to grieve.'
