The Utah couple who were found dead in their home along with their three children were identified Sunday night, as investigators rule ruled out 'violent assault' in the tragic case. 

A family member made the gruesome discovery of husband and wife Benjamin and Kristi Strack, 37 and 36, around 8pm Saturday night at their home in Springville, Utah. The family member also found the bodies of the Strack's two sons, Benson, 14, and Zion, 11, and that of their 12-year-old daughter, Emery. 

Police are still investigation the mysterious death of the family of five, but say a preliminary investigation ruled out violent assault in their deaths.

'At this point, the cause of death has not been determined, and won’t be until the results of laboratory testing is completed,' local authorities said in a release. 

Springville police Lt David Caron said Saturday that carbon monoxide may be to blame, even though the toxin wasn't detected in a preliminary search of the home. 

Firefighters checked the house for carbon monoxide but admitted that, were that the cause, the gas may have already dissipated by the time the firemen tested the air.  

Law-enforcement officials were called to the home about 8pm on Saturday by a concerned relative.

'They said they had spoken with the family earlier this morning and hadn't heard from them and stopped by,' spokesman Lt Caron told the Deseret News.

'When they went in and found the five of them, they immediately called us.'   

The home is down the street from Springville High School.
