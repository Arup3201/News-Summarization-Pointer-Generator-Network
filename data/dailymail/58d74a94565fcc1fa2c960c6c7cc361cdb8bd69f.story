Little House On The Prairie star Alison Arngrim has revealed how playing the hit TV show’s iconic baddie helped her cope with the fact that she had been sexually abused when she was younger.

Arngrim was 12 years old when she landed the iconic role of Nellie Oleson, the scheming brat with blonde pigtails and prim dresses.

She has described the role as ‘absolutely therapeutic’ as she struggled to deal with the aftermath of being sexually abused by a relative for three years from when she was six.

‘So here I was playing this girl that everyone was afraid of and it's great,’ said Arngrim, speaking in a new episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? which airs on Sunday.

‘I'm paid to play this person who screams, yells, throw things, vents her anger, just lets it out, doesn't care who's looking, shows all the worst parts, makes terrible faces and doesn't care how awful she looks. It was absolutely therapeutic.’

Because she was so young, Arngrim says she didn't tell anyone when the abuse started.

‘I wasn't quite completely clear on exactly what it was that was being done to go report this,’ she said.

‘So when I started to get older and realize what it was, that's when I actually said “No, I'm not doing this anymore.” And amazingly, it stopped.’

Little House On The Prairie star Alison Arngrim says her cast mates never knew about her abuse and she even kept the secret from her family

Arngrim says her cast mates never knew about the abuse, and she even kept the secret from her family.

‘It was awful,’ she said. ‘It's keeping the secret is the worst part. It's wondering, can someone tell by looking at you?’

Arngrim, who now does work with the National Association to Protect Children, said she finally came to terms with what happened her when she was in her early 20s.

‘I actually read somewhere the average length of time for someone to come forward about being sexually abused is 14 years from the incident,’ she said.

‘I was in my early 20s when I first started talking about it and went to therapy, so I was right on schedule - textbook.’

Arngrim first spoke out about the abuse in her memoir Confessions Of A Prairie Bitch: How I Survived Nellie Oleson And Learned To Love Being Hated, released in 2010.

Speaking to Larry King at the time she refused to name the perpetrator - 'for personal reasons and for legal reasons' - but did clarify it was not one of her parents.

When asked about the nature of the abuse, she replied: 'Obviously I prefer not to go into specific, graphic details, but really, at six I did not understand exactly what was happening.

'I did not know what sex was. I did not know what he was doing because I did not know what it was.'

She did not report it, saying: 'When you are physically threatened you don't tell people.'

Arngrim said acting and playing Nellie Oleson helped her deal with the anger.

'[Nellie] was a girl I grew to love,’ she wrote in her book. 

‘She got me out of my house when I thought there was no escape. 

Screen foes but in reality Arngrim was 'best friends' with Melissa Gilbert, who played her arch nemesis Laura Ingalls on the hit show

‘She transformed me from a shy, abused little girl afraid of her own shadow to the in-your-face, outspoken, politically active, big-mouthed bitch I am today.'

Arngrim wrote that people still confuse her with that nasty character she last played more than  30 years ago.

'To be 11 or 12 and have everyone call you a bitch to your face every day of your life is very strange,' she told The Today Show in 2010. 

'I’ve been spat upon, beaten and pelted with garbage at a Christmas parade. I was beaten up at a personal appearance.'

As for the other cast members, Michael Landon was apparently very different from his perfect character Charles Ingalls. 

Little House on the Prairie, which ran for 10-seasons during the '70s and '80s, revolved around the day-to-day life of the Ingalls family of Walnut Grove, Minnesota

'He liked the fast cars, the Ferrari; he was married several times,' Arngrim  recalled. 

'He was a really Hollywood producer-director type. He smoked, he drank, he told dirty jokes.'

She also revealed in the book that she was 'best friends' with Melissa Gilbert, who played her arch nemesis Laura Ingalls.

Arngrim, now a stand-up comic and actress, started on the hit show aged 11 in 1974 and remained until 1981 when her character grew up and got married.
