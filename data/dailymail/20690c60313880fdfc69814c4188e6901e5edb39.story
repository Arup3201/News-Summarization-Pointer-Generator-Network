One of the most prominent characters on the campaign trial in the wake of the first Presidential debate was Big Bird, the Sesame Street puppet beloved by millions but targeted by Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

After the former Massachusetts governor took aim at PBS- and, as a result, Big Bird- during the debate, it was one of President Obama's top advisers who turned that comment into a major talking point.

A profile in The New York Times details how Stephanie Cutter, one of the President's deputy campaign managers, turned the television puppet into a manifestation of Mitt Romney's vision.

'She spotted right away that this was something that was trending out there and that was making an impact,' chief Obama strategist David Axelrod said.

Two days after the debate, Ms Cutter posted a photo to Twitter of a person dressed as Big Bird at a Romney rally, with the caption 'looks like somebody showed up in (Virginia) to ruffle @mittromney's feathers'.

Making the point even more clear, she included the hashtag #protectsesamestreetnotwallstreet.

From there, the Big Bird argument picked up steam and the campaign went on to create a 30-second advertisement that jokingly compared notorious banking scammers like Bernie Madoff to the Sesame Street character who was described as 'big, yellow, a menace to our economy'.

Though Ms Cutter, 43, was not directly involved in the creation of the ad, the premise that she established in her original Tweet was very clearly the inspiration behind it.

Ms Cutter has long been a prominent operative for Democratic candidates, but she has begun to step in front of the camera more frequently during this election as a result of the prominent role she holds and the degree to which she has made herself an integral part of the Obama administration.

A close confidante to the late Senator Ted Kennedy, Ms Cutter first became involved with the Obamas when she helped arrange for former first daughter Caroline Kennedy's endorsement of the then-Senator from Illinois.

When it came time for Obama to take the realm, she had already gone through her own battles within the party as she was given much of the blame for John Kerry's failed presidential bid in 2004, even though Mr Kerry defended her in saying that it was not her fault.

The New York Times explains that following that fall from grace, she took what many viewed as a demotion by working with politicians seemingly in crisis mode: treasury secretary Timothy Geithner after the TARP bailout, and First Lady Michelle Obama after she made the gaffe in saying that her husband's nomination was the first time she was proud of her country.

Friends say that it is Ms Cutter's exacting nature that has helped her handle even the most tricky of trouble spots, justifying why she was given the delicate assignment of telling then-Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor to tone down her earring selections in order to pass through her confirmation hearings.

'She has an attention to detail that builds huge confidence on the part of the people she works for and, I say this parenthetically, especially women,' Anita Dunn, former Obama White House communications director told The Times.
