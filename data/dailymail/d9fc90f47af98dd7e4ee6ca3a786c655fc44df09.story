City leaders are hoping to build a whole village of wooden sheds to solve a homelessness crisis which is one of the worst in the U.S.

Two rival candidates for mayor in San Jose, California, have teamed up to demand dozens of 'microhouses' costing $5,000 each complete with doors, windows, insulation and electrics.

The idea had full support from one shed shop owner - though he admitted his high-end builds were usually used as home offices.

Two sheds are better than one: Two political rivals in San Jose, California, have joined forces to house the city's 7,000-strong homeless population in wooden 'microhouses'. The idea has been used elsewhere in the U.S.

Village: Some of the types of units which could be used - even though these usually become home offices

Paul Johnston, who runs The Shed Shop in nearby Fremont, told CBS Local: 'These are made just like a little house would be made'.

There would be no running water in the homes and occupiers would have to share a communal bathroom.

But Mr Johnston insisted the wooden sheds would be 'very livable' with a solid two-by-four construction - and some even have French windows.

The idea was put forward by rival city council members Sam Liccardo and Rose Herrera and is far from new.

In Wisconsin, high school construction students are building 'micro-cottages' for as little as $3,000 each and there is already a micro-cottage community in Olympia, Washington.

Home comforts: The sheds include insulation and built-in electrical wiring, but no running water or toilets

Metal shipping containers, meanwhile, have been turned into affordable housing in London, student accommodation in Berlin and even a boutique guest house in San Antonio, Texas.

But the need is especially dire in San Jose, whose leaders say it has one of America's highest numbers of unsheltered homeless people.

Campaigners say there are 7,000 homeless people in San Jose, a city which has been hit by soaring rents.

A modest apartment is only affordable to those earning around $30 an hour or more, three times the minimum wage in California.

The report by the rival politicians suggested putting up to 30 of the huts at a time on vacant land or in empty warehouses.

Thinking outside the box: Metal shipping containers have surged in popularity, including this guest house which was created for an artist in San Antonio, Texas, who wanted to experiment with architects

They insisted it would be a short-term move and residents would be encouraged to move to more solid homes once their lives are back on track.

'We have 
become painfully aware that San Jose has one of the largest unsheltered 
homeless populations in the U.S.', the report said.

'In a city
 of very scarce public resources, and a challenge as daunting as 
homelessness, we must be more resourceful'

'A tiny house is a relatively inexpensive short-term housing option for the homeless.

'Placed together on underutilized land, a collection of very small, economically cheap houses can become a tiny village that can be managed and maintained, offering another humane option for housing our vulnerable homeless population while long term housing options are sought.

'In a city of very scarce public resources, and a challenge as daunting as homelessness, we must continue to press to be more resourceful, more creative, and more innovative with our public dollars.

'Micro-housing may serve as a critical option for doing so'.
