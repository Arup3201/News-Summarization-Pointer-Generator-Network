Despite hitting the ripe old age of 35, Andrea Pirlo believes he is close to his best physical condition after helping Juventus return to winning ways in Serie A.

The Italian midfielder scored a trademark free-kick in the 2-0 victory over Empoli on Saturday evening to extend the Old Lady's lead at the top of the table to three points.

Second-place Roma lost to Napoli, and Juve's talisman Pirlo is full of confidence.

'Personally, I'm growing,' the Italy international said. 'I'm working hard and well during the week. I'm now close to my best condition.'

'It was important to win. We needed to immediately put the loss at Genoa behind us and take advantage of Roma's defeat.

'It's an important sign for us, a clear message to all of the Scudetto challengers.

Juventus are struggling in the Champions League, having won one and lost two in the competition, and Pirlo sees the midweek game at home to Olympiacos as a must-win.

'My mind is already on Tuesday evening. The Olympiacos game is effectively a final.'
