New York City congressman Michael Grimm is set to resign days after pleading guilty to felony tax evasion.

The Republican politician, who has represented his Staten Island constituency since 2011, initially said he would continue serving after admitting to hiding $1 million worth of wages and receipts from a Manhattan restaurant he partially owns.

But now he says he will step down, allegedly as a result of a meeting with House Speaker John Boehner.

The 44-year-old will leave office on January 5.

Change of heart: New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm  plead guilty to a federal tax felony last week but said he would not resign his congressional seat. Now he says he step down after 'much thought and prayer'

Grimm maintained his innocence throughout the 2014 congressional campaign season but copped to a crime after he won re-election

In a statement released Monday, Grimm said: 'After much thought and prayer, I have made the very difficult decision to step down from Congress effective January 5th, 2015. This decision is made with a heavy heart, as I have enjoyed a very special relationship and closeness with my constituents, whom I care about deeply.

'The events which led to this day did not break my spirit, nor will of the voters. However, I do not believe that I can continue to be 100 percent effective in the next Congress, and therefore, out of the respect for the Office and the people I so proudly represent, it is time for me to start the next chapter of my life.

'It has been an honor and a privilege to serve the hardworking families on both sides of the Verrazano, and I am sincerely grateful for the love and support that I have received from so many over the past few difficult months. 

'I have seen first-hand how extraordinary the people of this district are - their values, their love of community, and their care for each other in the best and worst of times - it is humbling. I am grateful, and I will always keep them in my prayers.'

Boehner lauded Grimm's decision in a statement on Tuesday but did not address rumors that the New York representative was leaving Congress at his urging.

'Rep. Grimm made the honorable decision to step down from his seat in Congress. I know it was made with the best interests of his constituents and the institution in mind, and I appreciate his years of service in the House,' the GOP leader said. 

Grimm's resignation means Governor Andrew Cuomo must call a special election for New York's 11th congressional district. 

Prosecutors have suggested Grimm should spend 24 to 30 months in prison; Grimm's lawyer suggested 12 to 18 months to Federal Judge Pamela Chen.

But a person who is familiar with the congressman's negotiations told DailyMail.com previously that the Republican lawmaker doesn't expect to go to jail at all.

'I'm going to get back to work and work as hard as I can,' Grimm said last week.

His fate will be up to Chen when she hears the terms of a plea agreement. Grimm was originally charged with 20 separate federal crimes and has been serving his constituents while under the terms of a $400,000 bond granted in the spring.

Grimm entered a guilty plea on a single count of 'aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of a false or fraudulent tax return.'

Sentencing is months away – on June 8, according to the Associated Press.

Loretta Lynch, the sitting U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., brought the indictment against Grimm this year making him the first federal lawmaker to face criminal charges since 2008.

Lynch later became President Barack Obama choice to succeed Eric Holder as U.S. attorney general.

By pleading guilty to a single tax charge, Grimm avoided a trial that was scheduled to convene in February. Jurors would have heard details of Grimm's alleged scheme to hide more than $1 million of his restaurant's sales and wages in order to dodge taxes between 2008 and 2010.

He was also accused of hiring illegal immigrants to work for him. 

Neither prosecutors nor Grimm's attorney has commented for the record. 

Upon leaving the court last week Grimm acknowledged his wrongdoing and apologized for his actions.

'I should not have done it and I am truly sorry for it,' he said, per AP.

The confession was a far cry from Grimm's claims when he was first charged that prosecutors were on 'a political witch hunt.'

'I'm a moral man, a man of integrity,' he said at the time. 

The Staten Island Republican easily won re-election to a third term in November despite campaigning under a cloud of suspicion for nearly five months.

He beat Democrat Domenic Recchia by a 55-42 percent margin to win a third term in office.

If Grimm avoids a prison sentence, the shoulder-chipped GOPer was expected to argue that he should remain in office during a period of probation. 

The House Ethics Committee had let its own investigation idle while the wheels of justice turned. But given last week's admission, the committee may have been planning to throw him out. 

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been pressuring Boehner to confront Grimm and request that he vacate his seat. 

'Speaker Boehner and Republican leaders’ continued complicity in letting Michael Grimm stay in Congress despite his guilt of felony tax evasion is a disservice to the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn and a stain on the institution of the United States House of Representatives,' a statement from House Democrats' campaign arm said.

Boehner 'owes it to the constituents and the Congress to make sure Michael Grimm doesn’t serve in this next Congress,' it continued.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had also called on Boehner to step in. 

According to the Associated Press, Grimm told reporters last week that he had spoken GOP leadership in the House but did not offer any additional details and again said he would continue to serve as long as he is able to.

Asked a similar question during his re-election campaign in October, the two-term congressman said, 'Certainly, if I was not able to serve, then of course I would step aside.' 

Grimm posted a $400,000 bond to remain free while tax fraud charges pended against him in a case revolving around alleged illegal cash payments he made to illegal-immigrant restaurant employees in order to avoid paying taxes

The court case against Grimm centered on his investment in Healthalicious, a Manhattan health food restaurant.

Lynch's indictment accused him of helping the company avoid paying taxes on more than $1 million in income, and using cash to underpay workers under the table. 

Some of those employees were allegedly illegal immigrants and earned less than the minimum wage.

The government claims Grimm kept two separate payroll ledgers, one of which was fictitious, allowing him to skirt income taxes, payroll taxes and workers' compensation costs.

When some of the employees sued the company for back wages, Grimm was deposed under oath. Prosecutors claim he testified, falsely, that he had never paid the restaurant's workers in cash.

In January, Grimm became a household name when a New York City journalist caught him on video threatening to throw him off a U.S. Capitol balcony for asking him a tough question about an unrelated federal probe into his 2010 campaign finances.

Grimm went ballistic when NY1 reporter Michael Scotto strayed away from the approved interview topics after President Barack Obama's State of the union Speech on January 28.

The congressman waled out of range of the camera suddenly when the topic came up, saying he didn't want to speak 'off-topic.'

Michael Scotto, a video journalist for the NY1 television station, was on the receiving end of a Grimm threat in January at the US Capitol

Grimm 'does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances,' Scotto said, closing his televised segment.

But the camera kept rolling as the congressman barked.

'Let me be clear to you,' he said. 'You ever do that to me again I’ll throw you off this f***ing balcony.'

'Why? It’s a valid question,' Scotto responded.

'No, no, you’re not man enough, you’re not man enough,' Grimm sniped back.

'I’ll break you in half. Like a boy.'

Grimm apologized the following day.

His long-time girlfriend, Diana Durand, pleaded guilty in September to illegally funneling money to his campaign by paying 'straw donors' to make the contributions.

In some cases she reimbursed them after the fact. 

The scheme obscured where the donated money originally came from and allowed Grimm to reap more of Durand's campaign cash than the law allowed.
