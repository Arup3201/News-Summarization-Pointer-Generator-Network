Currently, around one in 100 children develops autism

Boys who have induced births are a third more vulnerable to autism, according to research.

Around one in five deliveries in the UK is assisted, where drugs such as oxytocin are used to trigger labour.

Researchers in the US analysed 625,042 live births linked with school records, including 5,500 children classified with autism.

Babies whose births are assisted by induction or speeded up by drugs have a higher risk of developing autism, claim researchers

Girls were found to be at a smaller increased risk where medication is used to enhance contractions.

But British experts defended induction saying its use outweighed  potentially fatal complications.

Currently, around one in 100 children develops autism but symptoms do not usually become apparent until the second year of life.

Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)  affects an estimated 600,000 children and adults in the UK.

Researchers at Duke University 
Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, found the risk of autism in boys
 is between 15 per cent and 35 per cent higher. But the chances of an 
assisted birth child developing autism remain very low, said their 
report in journal JAMA Pediatrics.

Two in 1,000 autism cases among boys 
whose mothers experienced induced or augmented labour could have been 
prevented, they found.

Carol Povey, of the National Autistic
 Society, said: ‘Autism is a complex condition and is thought to be the 
result of many different underlying physical and genetic factors.

‘It’s therefore important that people do not jump to conclusions about this study and its implications.’

Autism, or autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), including Asperger’s syndrome, is an umbrella term for a range of developmental disorders that have a lifelong effect on someone’s ability to interact socially and communicate.

An estimated 600,000 children and adults in the UK are affected by ASD and genetic factors play a role in its development.

The study found induction or the use of drugs to affect the rate or strength of contractions (known as augmented) were linked with a higher risk of autism being diagnosed in childhood.

Researchers led by Simon Gregory of Duke University Medical Center, Durham, found the risk ‘particularly pronounced’ in male children.

The risk of autism in boy babies who had an induced or augmented labour is between 15 per cent and 35 per cent higher than for those who do not, the exact amount depending on whether the labour was induced, augmented or both.

In the case of boys, both raised the risk of autism whether used together or individually.

Only augmentation alone was associated with an increased risk among girls.

The study allowed for factors such as socioeconomic status, maternal health, pregnancy-related events and conditions, and birth year, says a report in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

But the actual chances of a child developing autism after assisted birth remain very low, said the researchers.

Two in 1,000 autism cases among boys whose mothers experienced induced or augmented labour could have been prevented if their births were unassisted.

Further work is needed to investigate the reasons for the link, they said, but it does not justify changes in clinical practice.

Co-author Dr Chad Grotegut, also from Duke University, said ‘The findings of this study must be balanced with the fact that there are clear benefits associated with induction and augmentation of labour.

‘Labour induction, especially for women with post-date pregnancies or medical conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, has remarkably decreased the chance of stillbirth.’ Prof Kevin McConway, Professor of Applied Statistics at The Open University, said there was evidence autism is linked with risk factors associated with ‘a difficult birth’.

But the effect of these risk factors is quite small - about 13 in 1000 boys in the study were recorded as having autism - and it is far from clear what is causing what, he added.

‘If, magically somehow, all the mothers of boys who had induction or augmentation could have not had it, while everything else remained the same, then the number of their children with autism diagnoses would reduce by only 2 in 1000. The association in girls is even weaker, too small to be of statistical significance’ he said.

Prof McConway said ‘Maybe something else - some genetic factor, or something that occurred earlier in pregnancy or during the birth that the researchers could not take into account - is causing some babies to be more likely to have an induction of labour and separately making it more likely that they have autism.

‘We can’t just stop doing inductions or augmentations. As the researchers very clearly point out, there are very large benefits to the mother and to the baby in appropriate cases.

‘Even if it turns out that we could save a few children from autism by inducing many fewer labours, that would come at a major cost in other complications, including deaths to mothers and babies.

‘There’s certainly nothing here that pregnant women or new mothers should be particularly concerned about, in my view. The researchers make it explicit their work gives no reason to change medical practice, and I absolutely agree with them on that.’
