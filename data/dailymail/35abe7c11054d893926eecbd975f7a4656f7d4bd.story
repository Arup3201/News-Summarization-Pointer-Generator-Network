It has been part of Christmas for 800 years - but it seems the humble mince pie's popularity is crumbling.

Sales of the mincemeat treat have fallen by 1.5 per cent, prompting Tesco to launch five bizarre new flavours in a bid to turn shoppers back to pastry.

Fillings now competing with traditional mincemeat include chocolate and hazelnut, golden salted caramel and rhubarb and stem ginger.

The supermarket chain predicts that it will sell two million of the 'alternative' pies - but still shift a healthy 30 million of their more traditional cousins.

Market research by the supermarket giant claims people 
aged 20 to 40 are avoiding mince pies because they do not like the traditional fruit filling.

Spokesman Mike Baess said: 'We hold customer tasting panels and generally younger people were more in favour of different types of fillings.

'We also found that there has been a slight decline in people buying fruited puddings and fruit cake - including Christmas pudding.'

The other new flavours revealed by Tesco include red wine mulled fruit with a butter crumb topping, and the more traditional apple and cinnamon.

It comes after mince pie sales fell 1.5 per cent between the Christmas periods in 2011 and 2012 across the industry, according to the retail analysts Nielsen.

Tesco picked the new flavours by holding focus groups with younger customers, who they fear are drifting away from mincemeat, and asking them what flavours they wanted to see on the shelves.

Tesco bakery spokeswoman Kim Hesketh, who took part in the workshops, said: 'Food tastes change over time and as we’re seeing right now the mince pie is no exception to the rule and is evolving.

'Demand for fruited puddings and fruit cake in general is declining. In the last few years we’ve seen sales of sponge puddings grow over the festive season as an alternative to the traditional Christmas pud.

'What we’re hoping to do by bringing in these alternative flavours is cater for this change in taste and offer alternatives so that shoppers have a choice. We want the mince pie and its new alternatives to continue to be loved by generations to come.'

The new alternative Christmas pies cost between £1.65 and £2.75 per pack, but they are not the first to try and make a crust from the 'alternative pie' market.

The chocolate gift firm Hotel Chocolat sells 'pies' made entirely of chocolate - including fillings of praline and salted caramel placed in a milk chocolate 'cup'.
