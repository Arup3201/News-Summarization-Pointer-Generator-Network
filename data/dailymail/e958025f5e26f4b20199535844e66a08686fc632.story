The world's first skateboard cop is now patrolling the streets of America on his longboard.

Officer Joel Zwicky, 40, keeps tabs on his patch while riding around on a Green Bay police customised board.

He patrols the parks and pavements on his skateboard - while wearing his kevlar vest, sidearm, ammunition and radio as normal.

And if he receives a 'hot call', Officer Zwicky can place his skateboard in the passenger seat of his unmarked dodge patrol car to race to the scene of major incident.

The father-of-three said: 'It has been fantastic since we rolled out the skateboard.

'There has been all kinds of support from the people I meet while I am out skating.

'It is an idea I had two years ago. Initially the idea got some laughs for years, but this year it seemed like a good idea as the chief wanted us to get out of our cars and engage with the public more.

'I told him about this idea I had and the chief said just go out there, don't get hurt and we will see what happens.'

And in a first of its kind anywhere in the world, Officer Zwicky now hopes to introduce a full unit consisting just skateboard cops.

He added: 'The long board has opened up a niche for law enforcement that hasn't been explored before.

'I have been contacted by some law enforcement agencies, just individual officers, who have a passion for skateboarding asking how I started this program up and how they could do it where they live.'

Green Bay Police Captain Bill Galvin said: 'We have one-man cars. He's a one-man skateboard.

'Just like officers walking a beat, this is an extension of that.'

And Officer Zwicky's colleagues say they couldn't believe him when he first mentioned the idea.

Capt. Galvin added: 'At first, I've got to admit, I was like, seriously?'

'But when he explained more how he wanted to get into the parks and spend time with kids, it made sense.'
