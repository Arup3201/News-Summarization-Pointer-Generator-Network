More than 3,000 women in the UK face complications from controversial French breast implants it was feared today as the Government launched a review of the risks.

The reassessment was triggered after a major cosmetic surgery company told ministers privately that rupture rates could be as high as 7 or 8 per cent.

Around 40,000 women in Britain are 
believed to have had silicone implants made by the Poly 
Implant Prothese (PIP), including thousands who underwent reconstructive
 breast surgery through the NHS.

Transform apparently 
carried out 4,000 of the implants, but if its estimate is replicated 
across the total, up to 3,200 women could be affected.

The UK regulator, the Medicines and 
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, had previously indicated the risk
 of rupture was one per cent.

As Health Secretary Andrew Lansley ordered a review by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, it was revealed that:

Mr Lansley said said the new information had left him ‘concerned and unhappy’.

He added: 'We are doing everything we can to ensure that women with these implants get the best possible advice.

'So far, all the evidence from around the world suggests that women should not be worried and that there have not been abnormal levels of problems reported with these implants. But if any woman is worried, then they should contact their surgeon or GP.

‘We have, however, received new data 
that requires full assessment and evaluation, so I have asked Prof Keogh
 to lead an urgent investigation so that we  can establish exactly what 
has happened and whether we need to improve the regulatory regime.’

Review of data: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley is 'unhappy' and 'concerned'

Mr Lansley said he wanted to reassure 
women that if new data came to light that called into question the 
safety of the implants, the Government would act swiftly to help them.

‘Our top priority is making sure that women get the correct advice so that they are kept safe,’ he added.

The review is expected to report its initial findings to ministers this week.

At least 3,000 NHS patients, many of 
whom were recovering from breast cancer, were given faulty implants 
during reconstructive surgery, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

British surgeons warned about the PIP implants five years ago with one doctor in the northeast writing in the British Journal of Plastic Surgery how he was discontinuing using the implants  because of their 'reliability.'

About 400 British women are believed to be planing to bring civil cases against a number of cosmetic surgery companies for giving them faulty breast implants.

French authorities shut down PIP last 
year after the company was found to be using cheaper industrial silicone
 intended for use in mattresses.

French authorities said women should 
have them removed as a precaution over fears that the silicone could leak into the bloodstream.

Jean-Claude Mas, the 72-year-old 
former butcher who founded PIP, remains at his luxury villa on the 
Riviera, after being arrested following an Interpol hunt.

 is facing criminal proceedings with regard to a series of offences, 
including manslaughter resulting from the death of a French woman who 
was fitted with the implants.

Today
 the daily Nice Matin said he is listed as a technical and commercial 
consultant for a new firm set up by his son to make breast implants.

Since his company went bankrupt, it has emerged many of the implants 
were missing a protective coating designed to stop them from splitting 
and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body.

In
 Britain, Amanda Harrison, from Ramsgate, Kent, was one of the unlucky 
patients who suffered a ruptured implant four years after surgery.

Her
 Harley Street surgeon waived his fee to remove it this year but she 
still had to pay £1,500 for hospital costs and the anesthetist.

The
 40-year-old is still suffering today. The leaked silicone has spread to
 her lymph nodes and a scan has revealed two bulging lumps on her spine.

Gemma
 Garrett, 30, who was Miss Great Britain 2008, and beauty therapist 
Catherine Kydd, 39, have also had the implants removed after suffering 
painful complications.

Mrs Kydd, a beauty therapist from 
Dartford, Kent, started a Facebook page to 'bring together all victims' 
of the PIP implants after her breast augmentation at Transform.

She was in such pain she could not 
lie down without a bra and a scan found there had been a rupture with 
the silicone leaking into her lymph nodes.

'It was absolute hell,' she said. 'I
 now have industrial silicone in my body and have no idea what the long 
term effects are. I have to now live with this for the rest of my life.'

Transform's chief executive Nigel 
Robertson told the Sunday Telegraph he has urged the company's patients to 
see their surgeons if they are worried.

He said: 'We have taken 3,000 calls in the week before Christmas about this.'

About 2,500 French women fitted with 
the implants have registered complaints with a court in Marseilles. Nine
 others with PIP implants were also found to have a rare form of cancer.

So far tests have failed to find any firm evidence the implants could trigger the disease

France’s health minister Xavier 
Bertrand announced that women could have the implants removed, paid for 
by the French health service, as a ‘preventative’ measure.

Worried: Catherine Kydd set up a support group on Facebook for those 
affected by their implants and Gemma Garrett, a former Miss Great 
Britain, was in pain after hers were fitted

More
 than half of PIP's exports went to South America, including to 
Venezuela, Colombia, Argentina and Chile. Some 25,000 women are believed
 to have had the implants in Brazil alone.

Brazil has now banned the implants, but would not guarantee free surgery for women to have them removed.
