Up in the back bedroom of a three-storey terrace house in a Northamptonshire town, a young couple have been busy making the most of the good weather to boost their online business.

Where a bed and wardrobe should be, there are now filing cabinets filled with packs of pills and phials of liquid. On a nearby desk sit two computers and a stack of padded envelopes ready to deal with the flood of incoming orders.

Exactly how much money this internet ‘pharmacy’ was turning over each week will no doubt emerge in time. But last week, when I accompanied a team of investigators from the medicines watchdog on an early-morning raid, more than £50,000-worth of illegal drugs were crammed into this one room alone.

Slimming pills: Their main market is women desperate to find a quick-fix way of shedding the pounds ahead of their summer holidays

It became apparent who these banned medicines were targeted at as the team sifted through their haul — packet after packet of multi-coloured capsules in boxes branded with the image of a trim, young woman showing off her toned body in a crop-top and shorts.

They are slimming pills and their main market at this time of year are women desperate to find a quick-fix way of shedding the pounds ahead of the summer holiday season.

The trouble is that what is on offer here is banned in this country because the ingredients, manufactured in unregulated laboratories in China and India, could cause serious illness or death.

‘In the spring, women will go online and buy a couple of months’ worth of tablets which they think will help them fit into their bikini,’ explains Danny Lee-Frost, head of enforcement operations at the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

‘But buy from websites like these and you don’t know what you are getting — these pills can cause strokes and heart attacks. They are dangerous.

‘You also have no idea where this stuff is being manufactured or stored, and you cannot guarantee how much active ingredient each pill contains. In the past, we have raided places where different chemicals were being mixed up in cement mixers, with the stuff on the floor being swept up and shovelled back in. They just don’t care.’

And make no mistake, the sale of illegal diet pills and other banned medicines over the internet is big business.

In the UK over the course of the past few days, the MHRA and Home Office Border Force have seized some 3.6 million doses of medicine worth £9.5 million as part of a crackdown on the illegal internet trade in harmful counterfeit, unlicensed and adulterated medicines.

They have also shut down almost 2,000 websites and removed nearly 20,000 links to these sites that were supported by social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

The nationwide haul included steroids, numerous types of erectile dysfunction products and a wide variety of slimming pills. The vast majority are bought in bulk from abroad, imported into Britain and sold on via the internet.

In the raid I witnessed, the drugs had first been shipped to a mail-forwarding address in London and then on to the couple, both of whom are Polish immigrants, in Wellingborough.

And it was from there that the pills were then sold via their website. Two of the products on offer — Slimex 15 and Slim Trim — contain sibutramine, a weight-loss drug previously available on prescription as Reductil. But in October 2010 it was withdrawn from the market and is now a controlled substance.

Action was taken after some of those taking sibutramine reported adverse health effects, including raised blood pressure and pulse rate. There were also concerns it could pose a significant risk in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias or strokes.

Lilla Goatcher, 28, was prescribed slimming pills twice and had extreme reactions

Before it was banned in Britain, Lilla Goatcher, 28, was among those to be prescribed the drug — and experienced first-hand its worrying side-effects. Lilla, of Hove, East Sussex, first tried it as a teenager after her weight climbed to 13st. Despite trying conventional diets and joining Weight

Watchers and Slimming World, she could not shift the pounds. Her doctor suggested she try Reductil. The pills work as an appetite suppressant, and over the course of the two months that Lilla was taking the drug she lost a stone. But all the time she was battling against deeply unpleasant side-effects.

‘For the first couple of weeks it wasn’t too bad — a racing heart as if I had drunk far too much coffee,’ says Lilla, who is now married and works in digital marketing. ‘But then I started not to be able to sleep and would be up all night. That was followed by really excruciating stomach ache and pains in my chest which in the end got so bad I decided to stop taking the pills.’

Despite that experience, Lilla was once again prescribed the pills shortly before they were banned in 2010. This time she requested a lower dosage — but even so she suffered as before. ‘I started having heart palpitations and once again couldn’t get to sleep,’ she says.

‘I couldn’t concentrate and started to feel terribly light-headed. The reaction was still quite extreme.’

After a month, she binned the remaining tablets and was not at all surprised subsequently to learn that Reductil had been withdrawn from sale in the UK and many other countries around the world. She was lucky the health problems she suffered were only temporary.

Two years ago, an 18-year-old girl from Dublin who bought slimming pills online containing sibutramine ended up fighting for her life.

After just five days taking the pills, the teenager developed ischaemic colitis, a severe swelling of blood vessels supplying the intestines. It rarely occurs in young women and resulted in her having her colon surgically removed.

The girl, who was not named, was not overweight. She told doctors she had bought the drugs to ‘tone up’ for a holiday.

It is not just pills containing sibutramine that are causing concern. The MHRA is seeing increasing online sales of ‘herbal’ and traditional Chinese slimming medicines. Some of these concoctions contain dangerous levels of heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic and lead.

The herbal medicines often contain some sort of active ingredient which is not disclosed on the labelling. This month the MHRA has issued warnings about three products found to contain undeclared prescription-only ingredients.

A recent batch, aimed at women, was found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient of Viagra. These pills won’t help with slimming but will give a reaction, such as facial flushing, which dupe the consumer into thinking they are working.

Other herbal medicines have been found to contain substances such as the plant extract ephedra, which is classed as a prescription-only medicine in the UK because of the serious side-effects it can cause.

These include insomnia, psychosis and heart palpitations leading to serious cardiac complications.

Of course, the added risk when buying online is that it is impossible to know how strong the pills are, what they contain and how the individual will react to them. It is something 31-year-old dance teacher Samantha Ntritsou, from the West Midlands, learned to her cost when she bought slimming pills from eBay. Although she was a size 12 and weighed 10st, she was keen to lose weight around her stomach.

‘I paid £90 for three months’ supply,’ she says. ‘It was a lot of money but I thought it would be well worth it. When they arrived in the post I couldn’t wait to get started.’ But shortly after beginning the course, Samantha began to notice a change in how she felt.

‘I was full of excess energy,’ she says. ‘I began to feel constantly agitated, too, I kept snapping at my family and I couldn’t sleep.’

Stranger behaviour also began to manifest itself. Samantha started to experience feelings of paranoia.

Convinced she was being spied upon, she suffered a breakdown.

‘At the hospital I totally freaked out,’ she says. ‘I was screaming and running around the wards where patients were sleeping.’

Hospital security were called and wrestled her to the ground. The police were summoned and Samantha was sectioned to a psychiatric ward where she was given sleeping pills and mood stabilisers.

At first, doctors believed she might be bi-polar until a paramedic discovered the slimming pills — and that they contained ephedra. They quickly linked the drug to her behaviour. After two weeks, Samantha was allowed home with daily visits from a psychiatric nurse. Three months later the fuzzy unreality gave way to a shocking truth.

‘I had done humiliating things and put my family through hell — all because I had wanted to be thin,’ she recalls. ‘I’d developed paranoid psychosis just so I could get a flat stomach.

‘My parents were wonderfully supportive, but many of my friends dropped me or shied away. I was dating a man, but he didn’t contact me again after I was sectioned.’

In the six years since, Samantha has made a full, if slow, recovery and got married recently.

‘I haven’t had any long-term psychiatric problems,’ she said. ‘But it took a year to put my life back together. I’m lucky — if that paramedic hadn’t discovered my pills, I might still be in that unit and on heavy-duty medication for life.’

The fear is that given the scale of the trade in these drugs on the internet — and the lengths people are prepared to go to lose weight — others will be less fortunate.
