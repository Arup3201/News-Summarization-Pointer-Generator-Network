This is terrifying moment two Red Arrows planes appear to come within inches of a mid-air collision.

Amateur photographer David Sleight, 51, captured the image of two Hawk jets seemingly seconds from disaster at RAF Waddington's International Airshow in Linconshire on Sunday.

The jets were seen hurtling towards each other at extremely high speed in what looked like a high-risk game of chicken, before finally criss-crossing away at the last possible moment.

Inches from disaster: Amateur photographer David Sleight, 51, captured the terrfying picture of two Hawk jets seemingly seconds from a deadly mid-air collision at RAF Waddington's International Airshow in Linconshire on Sunday. He described his photograph as a 'one-in-a-lifetime image'

Well-positioned: Red Arrows Hawks paint the sky red, white and blue at Sunday's RAF Waddington International Airshow. University lecturer David Sleight was able to capture a number of photographs of their stunning display as guest of honour at the event

Privilege: David Sleight was invited to the show by Station Commander at RAF Waddington, Richard Barrow, because of his ties to the RAF as Dean of Public Engagement at the University of Lincoln. He described his time at RAF Waddington as a 'golden moment'

Mr Sleight took the striking image on Sunday as the famous Red Arrows flying team put on a show for thousands of spectators at the RAF Waddington.

The university lecturer said he could not believe his luck when he caught two of the acrobatic jets about to cross paths just feet away from each other at around 3pm.

'It was a golden moment. It’s a once in a lifetime image,' he said.

'It had been so exciting to watch the planes crossing and I had plenty of pictures of that but when I saw that photo I ran back to the hosting area of the show immediately,' he added.

Mesmerising: David Sleight's guest of honour status enabled him to find a good spot to take photographs of the Red Arrows, who are celebrating their 50th anniversary

Memories: David Sleight said he found the Red Arrows' display exciting, adding that he already taken a number of photographs  - including this one of a Hawk jet traveling upside down - before capturing his 'golden' image of two planes appearing to play a high-risk game of chicken

History: The Red Arrows formed in late 1964 as the official all-RAF aerobatics team, replacing a number of unofficial teams that had been sponsored by the air force

Machines: The Red Arrows started using BAE Hawk T1s in 1979. The Hawks are modified with an uprated engine and a modification to enable smoke to be generated. Diesel is mixed with a coloured dye and ejected into the jet exhaust to produce either red, white or blue smoke

Mr Sleight said he went straight over to his group of friends after taking the photograph because he didn’t want them to think he had Photoshopped the image.

'You see pictures all the time of them passing each other or about to but to get them almost nose to nose is a very rare occurrence indeed,' he said.

RAF Waddington is the largest of all the RAF Air Shows and is regularly attended by more than 140,000 spectators.

Mr Sleight was invited to the show by Station Commander at RAF Waddington, Richard Barrow, because of his ties to the RAF as Dean of Public Engagement at the University of Lincoln.

This guest of honour status enabled him to find a good spot to take photographs of the Red Arrows, who are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year.

A spokesperson for the RAF said: 'To be clear this superb photograph was of the Red Arrows synchro pair, who complete manoeuvres such as this safely and professionally on a daily basis.’
