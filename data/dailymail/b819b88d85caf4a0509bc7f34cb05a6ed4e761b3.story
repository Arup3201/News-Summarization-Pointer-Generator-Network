A British teacher who has Emirates’ logo tattooed on his arm and has received £13,000 in free upgrades while visiting nearly 80 countries may be the Gulf carrier’s most devoted customer.

Glasgow-born globetrotter Andy McGinlay teaches English in Thailand and uses the luxury airline so often that his photograph is on the ‘celebrity customer wall’ at the company’s headquarters in Dubai – alongside Michael Jackson, Cristiano Ronaldo and Paris Hilton.

The loyal customer has been invited into the cockpit to pose for photos and was given a surprise 28th birthday party on board one of Emirates’ planes.

The 33-year-old said the most amazing experience was his first time flying in first class with Emirates

The 33-year-old has enjoyed Champagne in cognac in business and first class, and he proudly boasts that he is Emirates’ best customer.

In 2013, after nine years of flying with the United Arab Emirates flag carrier, Andy decided to get the company’s logo tattooed on his right arm.

He has become a celebrity with staff, who frequently pose for photos with him and treat him to upgraded seats in Emirates’ luxurious first and business classes.

Andy said: ‘My mum calls me a walking billboard for Emirates and my friends think I’m nuts - they just don’t get my obsession.

‘Every time I’ve flown since I got the tattoo, the cabin crew are amazed - they always want to take photos with me in the galley showing off the tattoo.

‘The list of perks I receive for being a frequent flyer is long. But obviously being upgraded regularly is the biggest perk of all.’

Being a frequent flyer has its perks but the biggest perk of all is being upgraded regularly, said Andy

Andy said the most amazing experience was flying in first class, where he guzzled 10-year-old Dom Perignon Champagne, sampled a rare £500 bottle of Hennessy cognac, and savoured Iranian caviar.

Cabin crew gave him a cake when he celebrated his birthday with the airline.

He said: ‘I was flying business class from Dubai to Bangkok and the cabin crew saw it was my birthday from the date of birth on my passport.

‘They invited me to their first-and-business-class bar and showered me with gifts, champagne and a chocolate cake. I felt like a rock star.’

But McGinlay said that his friends back in the UK don’t always react well to his social-media updates featuring his VIP travels.

‘Last week I posted a picture on Facebook of my first-class boarding pass with a glass of Moet - and my friend commented “I hope you choke”. That sums it up really.’
