Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today, has rejected suggestions from Beijing that he should not meet the Dalai Lama

David Cameron has warned China it cannot use its economic might to dictate which leaders and countries Britain can deal with.

The Prime Minister plans to visit China before the end of this year, despite a growing diplomatic row over his talks 12 months ago with the Dalai Lama.

Downing Street sought to play down fears the dispute with Beijing could cost Britain billions in lost investment.

Huge building projects, including High Speed Rail and new nuclear power stations, could struggle to raise funding if China’s sovereign wealth fund refuses to invest.

Mr Cameron met the Dalai Lama with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in May last year.

But China has always warned foreign governments from holding talks with the Tibetan spiritual leader, who wants his homeland to enjoy self-rule free from Chinese control.

A visit by Mr Cameron to China last autumn was called off and a trade trip planned for last month was also cancelled.

But the Prime Minister has refused to bow to pressure from Beijing, despite warnings that investment in the UK could be put on hold until the crisis is resolved.

In strident remarks, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman insisted Britain would not be bullied by Cina.

‘The Chinese government always lobbies hard against any meetings between foreign governments and the Dalai Lama,’ he told reporters.

‘We have made clear in advance to the Chinese government that British minister will decide who they meet and where they meet them.

‘It is entirely reasonable for the Prime Minister to decide who he meets and I think it reflects our approach of dialogue, discussion and gathering a wide range of viewpoints on an issue of importance.’

Downing Street denied that Mr Cameron felt under ‘pressure’ to apologise to China, and rejected the idea that the PM has effectively been barred from visiting the Far Eastern superpower.

Mr Cameron hopes to lead a visit to China in the next seven months, although Number 10 would not give more details on when it might happen.

Government aides note that Mr Cameron recently met both the Chinese Communist Party secretary and premier.

Since the controversial Dalai Lama meeting in May last year, British ministers have had around 14 meetings with their Chinese counterparts.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today said the need to secure investment from China did not mean Britain could drop concerns about human rights

Six British ministers have visited China and four Chinese ministers have visited the UK in that period.

A spokesman added: ‘The figures speak for themselves. Chinese investment in the UK was $8 billion in 2012. That's four times more than the previous total.

‘Meanwhile, UK exports to China grew by 13.4 per cent last year, which is more growth than any of our European partners.

‘We want to establish a stronger relationship with China, recognising that it is in the interests of both countries to manage our differences with respect and co-operate as much as possible.’

The meeting between Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and the Dalai Lama was part of the Government's approach of seeking ‘dialogue and discussion and gathering a wide range of viewpoints on issues of importance’, said the spokesman.

It is thought that the venue for last year's meeting at St Paul's Cathedral was designed to stress that the Dalai Lama was being dealt with as a spiritual leader and not a politician.

But Number 10 refused to say whether religious issues were discussed, saying only that it was a private meeting.

Mr Clegg insisted he was not willing to put concerns over human rights to one side because of China's growing economic power

The Deputy Prime Minister told Sky News: ‘We have a very important relationship with the Chinese authorities. It's, self-evidently, one of the great economic superpowers of today and particularly the future. We have a very important economic relationship with them.

‘But that doesn't mean we should somehow give up on what we believe in when it comes to human rights and freedoms which we will continue to express in a respectful but nonetheless firm way.’
