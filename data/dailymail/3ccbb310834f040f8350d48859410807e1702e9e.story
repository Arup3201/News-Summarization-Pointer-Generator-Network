Google CEO Larry Page; The European Union's antitrust chief gave Google a 'last chance' of a few weeks to avoid formal charges for manipulating search results to promote Google services

Google has been given one month to change its advertising rules otherwise it will face court action in the EU.

The giant Internet search-engine firm has been ordered by EU competition regulators to make the changes by July 2 to end ‘abuses’ of its market dominance.

The company, which says it anticipates complaints of this kind due to its size and reach, risks being fined billions of pounds if it fails to comply with the orders.

The search engine, which has more than 80 per cent of the global market share, is accused of promoting its own products and effectively locking out rival advertisers.

The EU complaints add to similar concerns in the US and South Korea, where the company is also being investigated for allegedly abusing its near-monopoly position as an Internet search engine.

A Google spokesperson told the 
Telegraph: 'We operate in over 100 countries around the world, and the 
Internet is disruptive by its nature.

'It's understandable that our 
business should attract scrutiny and sometimes complaints in a few of 
these countries. We are always happy to answer questions authorities may
have about our business.'

The European Commission has written to the US giant highlighting four areas where ‘Google business practices may be considered as abuses of dominance’.

If Google's solutions are not satisfactory, the EC will begin a formal investigation, which could lead to it imposing huge fines and its own measures.

The announcement heralds the most significant transatlantic anti-competition row since Brussels went to war with Microsoft a decade ago.

It will also embarrass the Tory Party which has forged close links with Google, as revealed by the Daily Mail last week.

Research revealed that ministers, including David Cameron, had met executives an average of once a month since the election.

Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, has written to Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt demanding action.

He said Google favours its own products in search results and ‘copies’ content from rivals without permission.

It also stifles competitors with advertising deals with other websites and restricts them from moving their online campaigns to rival search engines, he added.

The review of Google’s business practices started in 2010 after complaints from rivals.

The commission can levy fines of up to 10 per cent of revenue, which could amount to billions of pounds.

Google has agreed to look into the EC’s concerns, though it disputed its conclusions.

A spokesman said competition on the web has increased ‘dramatically’ and the company faces ‘tremendous’ pressures.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched a similar investigation into claims of anti-competitive practices by Google.

Complaints: Google is under EU spotlight over its Android mobile software, the top operating system for Internet-enabled smartphones

Even if Google, the world's most popular search engine, offers concessions, it will still be under the EU spotlight after fresh complaints about its Android mobile software, the top operating system for Internet-enabled smartphones.   

If remedies were offered by Google within the coming weeks, the antitrust investigation could be brought to a close.   

‘I believe that these fast-moving markets would particularly benefit from a quick resolution of the competition issues identified. Restoring competition swiftly to the benefit of users at an early stage is always better than lengthy proceedings,’ Almunia told a news briefing.   

‘Google has repeatedly expressed to me its willingness to discuss any concerns that the Commission might have without having to engage in adversarial proceedings.

'This is why today I'm giving Google an opportunity to offer remedies to address concerns that we have identified,’ he said.   

Almunia said he had sent a letter to Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, with a deadline for a response.   

‘In this letter, I offer Google the possibility to come up in a matter of weeks with first proposals of remedies to address each of these points,’ he said.   

The European Commission launched an investigation into Google in November 2010 after competitors, including Microsoft, accused the company of manipulating search results to promote its own advertising services while demoting those of rivals

Competitors complain that Google's search results unfairly prioritise its own advertising services.  

Google controls nearly 44% of the global internet advertising market.

The Trade Commission is also looking into allegations that Google distorts its search results to steer people to its related businesses, like Google Places.

The agency recently hired a big name litigator, Beth Wilkinson, to lead its probe.    

The Commission has 16 complaints against Google before it, with the latest grievances coming from several online travel agencies, including TripAdvisor, Opodo and eDreams.    

The majority of complaints are from small competitors across Europe.    

The FTC is expected to come to a decision this summer on whether Google broke the law. Google is also the leader in U.S. searches, at 66 percent, according to comScore.   

Almunia is offering Google a last chance before issuing formal charges, said David Wood, a lawyer for lobbying group ICOMP, whose members include Microsoft, British price comparison site Foundem and German online mapping company Hotmaps, all three complainants in the EU case.   

‘This is effectively the Commission demanding remedies. Failing that there will be a statement of objections,’ he said.    

If Google can come up with remedies that the Commission finds acceptable following a market test, the Commission could then end the 18-month-long investigation without fining the company, Almunia said.

The majority of complaints are from small competitors across Europe.    

Almunia said other investigations into Google unrelated to the antitrust issue would continue.   

‘We continue the investigations on other issues, on other complaints we received recently, for instance all those complaints referring to Android or some complaints referring for instance to the way travel agencies are dealt by the Google search engine,’ he said.   

He declined to provide details on the Android investigation. Android-equipped smartphones compete with Apple's iPhone and other systems.    

The Commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global revenue for breaching EU rules and has in the past handed down multimillion-euro fines to Microsoft and Intel, among others.   

In Washington, two lawmakers who specialize in antitrust urged Google to reach a settlement with European regulators.   

Senators Herb Kohl and Mike Lee, who are respectively the Democratic chairman and top Republican on the Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, said they were ‘hopeful that Google would be a willing partner with the EU's Competition Commissioner.   

‘We continue to urge the FTC to investigate (Google) and to ensure a competitive search market where consumers can fairly pick the winners and losers in our online economy,’ the lawmakers said.    

A Google spokesperson said: 'We've only just started to look through the Commission’s arguments.

'We disagree with the conclusions but we're happy to discuss any concerns they might have.

'Competition on the web has increased dramatically in the last 2 years since the Commission started looking at this and the competitive pressures Google faces are tremendous. Innovation online has never been greater.'
