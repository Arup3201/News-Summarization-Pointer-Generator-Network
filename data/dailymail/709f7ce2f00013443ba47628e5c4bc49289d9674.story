If you're constantly on the worrying about your phone or laptop running out of battery when you're on the go, then a solution is in sight.

A backpack that claims to be able to change all your gadgets at once, has been launched

Ampl’s SmartBackpack has a variety of power packs stashed inside and even lets users see how how much power their devices have left without unzipping it, because it works with an app.

The San Diego-based company is raising money to put its $250 (£164) bag into production on Indiegogo, which can be customised to a user’s needs, with different-sized power packs. 

'The Ampl SmartBackpack can recharge all your devices, from a single power cable. Keep all your gear packed, charged and ready to go,' the company claims on its fundraising page.

The bag is filled with protective pockets to keep tablets, laptops and other gadgets separated and safe and has  a 'USB port in every pocket', with six ports in total.

It also has sensors inside to monitor environmental conditions such as temperature and users can see the stats, as well as how much power their devices have left, from an Oled screen on top of the bag, or by using a dedicated app.

The Ampl app also allows wearers of the backpack to manage the charging-priority of their devices and even be alerted if they have forgotten their bag. 

The back is filled with protective pockets to keep tablets, laptops and other gadgets separated and safe in the large backpack. It houses up to four batteries that charge different gadgets

The charging system of the Ampl SmartBackpack is comprised of six USB connections and a customisable number of batteries.

The basic version comes with an internal 18.5 watt-hour battery that can recharge a smartphone between two and three times.

The bag and supports up to three optional modular SmartBatteries which are sold separately.

The batteries come in two sizes. The first is TabletBoost, which supplies another 18.5Whs and can charge a smartphone and tablet simultaneously.

The second is LaptopBoost, which adds 55Whs and can charge most laptops directly or through the optional SmartInverter module with an AC outlet, sold separately.

The company says that the backpack is ‘an intelligent mobile charging system that can power portable electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets - even laptops - while protecting them with a shock-absorbing core and rain-resistant coating.’

An 5,000mAH battery is included in each bag, which has enough power to charge a smartphone two or three times depending on the model.

There is also room for up to three more batteries, which come in different sizes and are sold separately.

The first is TabletBoost, which supplies another 18.5 Watt hours (Wh) and can charge a smartphone and tablet simultaneously.

The second is LaptopBoost, which adds 55Wh and can charge most laptops directly.

The LaptopBoost and SmartInverter can be used to charge Macbooks and creates 55Wh.

If all the types of extra battery are added to the bag, it can be used to charge a smartphone three times, a tablet and two laptops.

Users can charge their gadgets while they are on the go, with gadgets plugged into ports inside the bag.

When the power packs are spent, they can be recharged using a power cable that pulls out of from a pocket on top of the bag, which plugs into a wall socket.

The bag itself is made from lightweight, water resistant material, but still weighs in at four pounds two ounces (2.32 kg).
