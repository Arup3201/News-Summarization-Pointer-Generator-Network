A billionaire’s wife allegedly 'keyed' a wealthy neighbour’s £120,000 car during a parking row behind her £21million home.

Stephanie Thapar, 50, is charged with causing more than £4,000 worth of criminal damage to the Bentley Continental GT Coupe V8 belonging to Michael Connor in Knightsbridge, central London.

Mr Connor saw Mrs Thapar put some rubbish bags next to his car, before walking to the back of the vehicle and scratching it 'five or six times with an unknown small object', a court heard yesterday.

Wealthy couple: Stephanie Thapar - pictured outside court yesterday with her husband Gautam - is charged with causing more than £4,000 worth of criminal damage to a £120,000 Bentley Continental GT Coupe V8

Scene: Mr Connor looked out of his window after hearing Mrs Thapar sound her horn as she tried to negotiate past his parked Bentley on this road (pictured) in Knightsbridge and enter her garage, the court was told

The mother-of-two is the second wife of Indian-born Gautam Thapar, 54, an engineering and paper entrepreneur who founded the Avantha Group and has an estimated net worth of £1billion.

She pleaded not guilty, denying she touched the vehicle, and was bailed to return to Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court in west London for a trial on July 29 – and ordered not to contact Mr Connor.

Tom Gill, prosecuting, said Mr Connor looked out of his window on January 22 at 7pm after hearing Mrs Thapar sound her horn as she tried to negotiate past his parked Bentley and enter her garage.

He added: ‘Mr Connor saw her reversing into her garage and she then got out of her vehicle, exited the garage and placed some rubbish bags adjacent to the complainant’s vehicle.

‘The defendant went back inside her garage and on this occasion when she exited her garage, walked to the rear of the Bentley and scratched it five or six times with an unknown small object.’

When he inspected his vehicle Mr Connor found ‘deep scratches in the paintwork’ and called police, who confirmed the damage was recent, the court was told.

Luxury life: Mrs Thapar lives in a five-bedroom, five-bathroom house, which has an integral lift, private two-car mews garage and has previously been advertised for rent at £56,333 per month

Worth £120,000: Mrs Thapar, 50, allegedly damaged a Bentley Continental GT Coupe V8 (file picture)

Hearing: She pleaded not guilty, denying she touched the vehicle, and was bailed to return to Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court (pictured) in west London for a trial on July 29 – and ordered not to contact Mr Connor

Mr Gill added: ‘The defendant was arrested and interviewed and completely denied the offence.’

An earlier trial date was changed because the couple are visiting India on business in June.

German-born Mrs Thapar was represented in court by leading QC Jeremy Dean, who was defending X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos when her drugs trial collapsed last July.

Mrs Thapar lives in a five-bedroom, five-bathroom house, with an integral lift and private two-car mews garage. It has previously been advertised for rent at £56,000 per month.

Mr Thapar - who has four children in total, and won an Ernst & Young entrepreneur of the year award in 2008 - accompanied his wife to court.

He started his career as a factory assistant in one of manufacturing companies of Avantha, a business conglomerate, before rising through the ranks and becoming group chairman in 2006.
