At last Sepp Blatter appears to be coming around to the use of technology.

I say appears as the man has said many things in the past which have not materialised, such as not standing for his fifth term as president of the world governing body – something he went back on when he announced he would stand again on Monday.

It is often at election time that he comes out with some of these popular proposals which do not materialise - but hopefully this is one that does not fall into that category.

New ideas: Sepp Blatter hopes to trial the referral system at the 2015 U20 tournament in New Zealand

Major benefit: Premier League referees such as Mark Clattenburg (pictured) will benefit from technology

For a long time I have advocated football experimenting with systems to see just how, or indeed if, technology can assist referees in their accurate calling of major decisions.

This was born out of frustration from my time as a top-flight referee and seeing replays of incidents in my games where I had made a clear error but was unable to change my decision - despite being aware that my initial view was likely to be wrong. 

That is incredibly frustrating and technological assistance is well overdue. An example of this was during the France versus Ireland World Cup play-off game in November 2009. Thierry Henry clearly handled the ball before crossing it for France to score their winning goal and qualify for South Africa.

The referee Martin Hansson  considered giving up refereeing following the incident. He knew that something was wrong, as one does in such situations, but he can do nothing about it other than ask the other officials.

Henry's handball: A review system could stop incidents like this from happening in the future

When they confirm that they have not seen anything untoward you have to allow a goal that you instinctively know should not stand, which has to be wrong.

It also seems illogical that the only person who needs to see replays is the one person who cannot currently see them.

It is interesting that Blatter is suggesting a system whereby the on-field referee has the final decision after a coach or manager has made a challenge. That might be the best way, although it is open to abuse by unscrupulous coaches who work in a tactical way. There might be a better way and I would encourage Blatter to try a number of review systems and compare the results.

Questions that should be considered include:

The ultimate aim must be to correct the clear and obvious inaccurate decisions made in good faith by the on-field referee. 

If the initiators of reviews are the coaches then a limit on the number of challenges would have to be in place. Once used, this could mean a terrible error cannot be corrected and that would defeat the object of the exercise completely.

How should it work? 

Blatter’s system will require a coach/manager to inform the fourth official that they are requesting a decision to be reviewed, rather like a tennis player or cricket captain does with Hawk-Eye. 

At the next stoppage in play the fourth official would tell the referee who would then look at a replay of the incident. If there is a clear error then he will overturn his decision, if not it will stand.

How many referrals per team/half/match? 

This is to be confirmed but I would expect no more than two challenges per team  and possibly only one per half. If the challenge proves to be correct then the coach will retain this challenge but if the referee was right then the challenge will have been used.

When will it be used?

Penalties – both those given and those not given, often when simulation is involved. The issue with that appeal is the call is often subjective and replays are ambiguous and open to interpretation. 

Offside calls that are clearly wrong can be challenged and corrected but only those leading to goals. These happen infrequently as Premier League assistants are so good but the Liverpool-Chelsea game last month would be one which would have benefitted from such legislation. 

Finally red card tackles and off-the-ball incidents could also benefit from referees reviewing replays but these might not be covered by this proposal.

Does it strengthen or undermine the referee? 

The inability to review glaring errors which everyone knows are wrong undermines referees and giving them the ability to review and correct their mistakes can only help the game.

Of course if one particular referee keeps losing challenges then he will be exposed as a poor referee and that cannot be a bad thing.

The best referees will be highlighted as the best umpires in cricket are. It would be good to see how many times referees are actually right.

How might it be exploited? 

Allowing coaches to be the instigators of challenges could allow them futile appeals to disrupt play and take the momentum away from opponents. 

Imagine a team is 1-0 up with five minutes to play and under sustained pressure. Their coach has two appeals left, so they will use a referral in order to waste time and get tactical instructions out to his team in order to take the ‘heat’ out of the game.

He could then use another review within a minute in order for the game to peter out. We all know the coaches who would attempt to do this.
