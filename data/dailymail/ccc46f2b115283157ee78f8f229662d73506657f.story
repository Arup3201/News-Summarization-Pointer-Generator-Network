The most generous Christmas shoppers are men

The most generous Christmas shoppers are, in fact,  men.

Those aged between 30-40 years old tend to spend the most - with a third of the age group  happy to spend more than £500.

But it may be a matter of 'throwing money at the problem' as they tend to buy fewer, more grand gifts than women do, according to a new study.

Female respondents, while they tend to be more careful with their money, seem to enjoy picking up a variety of gifts for loved ones.

The survey of 812 shoppers found fewer than half (48 per cent) of thrifty women will spend more than £250.

But they will end up buying more gifts than men, with more than two thirds planning to purchase more than 10. 

The survey also reveals that we're a nation of ultra-efficient Christmas shoppers who don't mess about.

Nearly 40 per cent people take two hours or less doing so; only one in five (20 per cent) needs three hours or more.  

Two thirds (60 per cent) of respondents said that money saved by being a savvy shopper would either go into the savings account or be spent on treating themselves.

Christmas shopping for pets seems to be one of the main trends this year, as more than half (53 per cent) said they would be splashing out on a gift for their furry friend.

Christmas shopping is on the up overall as people decide to flee the frantic high street. 

A significant two thirds (77 per cent) of British shoppers will do most of their shopping online this festive season.

Cyber Monday, which falls on December 1 this year, is traditionally the busiest online shopping day, as buyers rush to make sure all their orders arrive on time - and websites slash prices to encourage them.

A spokesperson for online market place Flubit.com, which commissioned the research, said: 'We discovered some interesting differences in Christmas shopping behaviours between men and women, young and old this year.

'This helps us to make our service more tailored and personal to our individual customers.'
