This is the shocking moment Whole Foods staff in New York City apparently threw a 'drunk' man out of the store and beat him up on the sidewalk after he tried to get into the supermarket after hours.

Video footage, captured on a passerby's cellphone, shows several employees confronting the man, known only as 'Adam', as he stumbles toward the Manhattan store's entrance and pushes his way in.

As the  man struggles to stay upright, the workers then seemingly grab him, before shoving him out of the building, causing him to fall headfirst on to the ground. One employee yells: 'Get the f*** out!'.

Trying to get in: Video footage, taken by a passerby, shows several Whole Foods employees confronting a man, known only as 'Adam', as he stumbles toward the store in Manhattan, New York, and pushes his way in

Intoxicated? One employee yells: 'Get the f*** out!' as the apparently drunk man lies on the ground (pictured). The worker, dressed in black clothes, then adds: 'You want to be a f***ing tough guy? Get the f*** out of here'

The male worker, dressed in black, then apparently steps outside the store and stands over Adam. 'You want to be a f***ing tough guy? Get the f*** out of here,' he tells him, while bystanders watch.

As the man lies on the ground, he informs employees - including a woman dressed in Whole Foods apron - 'I'm a veteran', before getting to his feet and running straight at the supermarket again.

Workers inside the store's entrance attempt to close the sliding front door, while two male employees appear to wrestle Adam to the ground. Alarmingly, one of them seemingly punches and kicks him.

In the five-minute video, later uploaded to Live Leak, bystanders can be heard gasping - with one shouting, 'Not the punch!' - while one employee drags Adam across the sidewalk by the arm.

In a fit of anger, another worker then appears to pick up the man's belongings and throw them forcefully on to the ground. Adam, meanwhile, lies groaning on the sidewalk several meters away.

A few minutes later, he stands up and runs at Whole Foods's front door for a third time, prompting an employee to seemingly shove him to the ground and say: 'Get your 'f***ing jacket and go home.'

As Adam - who appears to be intoxicated from his unbalanced movements and refusal to leave the store - lies on the sidewalk, one of his friends then says: 'Adam, give me your hand. Let's go.'

Following the altercation, which occurred at the Union Square Whole Foods on the night of December 30, the employees involved were placed on administrative leave by the supermarket.

Internal investigation: Following the altercation, which occurred at the Union Square Whole Foods (pictured) on the night of December 30, the employees involved were placed on administrative leave by the supermarket

A Whole Foods spokesman told DailyMail,com: 'Whole Foods Market is aware of the incident that took place in front of our Union Square store after hours on December 30th.

'The team members identified so far in the video have been placed on administrative leave while we complete our internal investigation.

'We take all incidents involving team members, customers and members of our community seriously and consider safety and security a top priority.'

An internal investigation is ongoing. No police charges are believed to have been filed.
