'Dine and dasher': Saul Zelaznog has been taken into police custody after allegedly failing to pay his bar tab

An alleged serial 'dine-and-dasher' has been arrested after the owners of a Reno pub named and shamed him on Facebook because he 'left without paying his hefty tab'.

Saul Zelaznog was taken into police custody today accused of failing to pay his $100 bill at Brewer's Cabinet on Tuesday night.  

The restaurant owners reported Zelaznog to police, but also took matters into their own hands by posting a picture of the Reno resident with a warning on their Facebook page.

In their post, the owners claimed the 'serial thief' also skipped out on bills at three other outlets - Chapel Tavern, Imperial and Campo. They also called on residents who saw  Zelaznog to 'remind' him to pay his bill.

'And, while you're at it, you could tell him that visiting restaurants/bars with your friends, running up a huge bill, roughing up servers and then bailing is pretty uncool...pathetic, really. Get a life, man,' they wrote on Wednesday.

Within hours, the post had gone viral with hundreds of shares and comments.

'Just trying to look out for all the other business owners,' co-owner Chris Kahl told Reno Gazette Journal.

'$100, that’s a lot of money to lose...All his friends paid and left, and he was the last one. The server needed to collect his money. He said he forgot his wallet.'

He said the server let Zelaznog go to avoid a confrontation, before Kahl contacted the Reno Police Department.

Name and shame: Restaurant Brewer's Cabinet identified Saul Zelaznog on Facebook, accusing him of not paying a bill

However Zelaznog tells a different story. He said there was simply a misunderstanding, and
he had forgotten a method of payment.

'They’re acting like I ran out of there. I was going to be back to take 
care of my tab,' Zelaznog told Reno Gazette Journal.

He said he was involved in a similar situation at another local restaurant, but left a 'nice watch' as collateral.

'I’m not trying to burn bridges around town,' he said. 'This is a small little town.'

Update: Brewer's Cabinet announce 'Mr. Z' has been taken into police custody

However staff at other watering holes that Zelaznog frequented disagree.

'Ya
know, it's really unfortunate that we put faith in people and they 
don't always pull through and it makes it harder for us to trust 
everyone else,' Campo manager Nick Meyer told KRNV news.

Brewer's Cabinet today announced on Facebook that Zelaznog was 'taken into custody' and they hope 'all of his outstanding debts are paid in time'.
