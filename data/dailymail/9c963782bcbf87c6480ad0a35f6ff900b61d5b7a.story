Charlie Paterson, 14, who died on Friday after plunging from the top of the tower block he lived in in Bow, east London

A Roman Catholic chorister has died after plunging from the top of the 19-storey tower block he lived in.

Former choirboy Charlie Paterson is said to have crashed through a ceiling and onto a concrete floor after the fall from an enclosed chute next to a stairwell.

Police were called to reports of an injured boy at Winford House in Bow, east London, where Charlie lived with his mother, stepfather and younger brother, at 6.30am on Friday.

Paramedics carried out extensive treatment but Charlie, who turned 14 at the start of the month, was pronounced dead at 7.07am after plunging from the top floor of the tower block.

A witness, who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw him on the ground. He crashed through the ceiling.'

Devastated relatives and friends from Bishop Challoner Catholic School in Tower Hamlets, where Charlie was a pupil, have left floral tributes and candles at the foot of the stairwell where his body was found.

A single rose believed to have been left by Charlie's mother, Emma Jewell, carried the message: 'Love you loads, always 
will. Always in our hearts and thoughts. Hope you're at peace now and 
happy. Sweet dreams, love Mum and Ian.

A yellow football was left in tribute bearing the message: 'Love you big bro. Every goal I score will be for you. Love, hugs and kisses. Harvey.'

And a bouquet of colourful flowers 
carried the message: 'To our lovely grandson Charlie. We will miss you 
lots. Love forever, nanny and granddad.'

Charlie, who played drums in a band and was a choirboy when he was younger, had just signed for Senrab youth team on 4 November.

Senrab FC, where Charlie played as a striker, left a football shirt with the message: 'Gone but not forgotten. RIP Coach Dave and your teammates.'

Senrab has produced a clutch of top football stars in recent years including three England captains - Terry, Ray Wilkins and Sol Campbell - as well as current England striker Jermain Defoe plus Ledley King and Lee Bowyer.

Paul Shea, the club's assistant secretary, said: 'Our hearts go out to the family.Â  We held a minute's silence in his honour at all our games on Sunday.

'He was an outstanding footballer and he was a really nice lad.'

Mr Shea said Charlie had been due to play for the club at the weekend.

Charlie's neighbour Nasim Begum, 31, said: 'My children are shocked. Its so scary and he is too young.

'I saw him all the time playing football. I used to see him coming home from school, walking with his friends.'
