The Block superstar couple Josh Terrett and Charlotte Ekas have failed to attract buyers to their newly overhauled apartment at auction.

As contestants continue to battle it out in a series of design challenges, the stunning one-bedroom apartment has been passed in at $390,000 on Saturday, which is $70,000 below the reserve price.

But currently up for a private sale with a price tag of $460,000 by Jellis Craig, agent Nathan Waterson told Daily Mail Australia there has been a number of interests since the auction ended.

‘We’ve had over 150 people turn up to inspect the apartment and it’s been well received with great offers. We don’t think anything went wrong at the auction on Saturday,' Waterson said.

The Block guest judge Frank Valentic said potential buyers didn't put their hand up at auction because they might have thought the property was going for too much due to 'The Block factor'.

'We’ll call it curse but that’s the reality of the Melbourne market, one out of three properties passes in at auction,' Valentic told the Herald Sun.

It comes after last year's series The Block Glasshouse triggered an uproar across the nation after Gold Coast couple - Michael and Carlene duffy alongside Dee and Darren Jolly from Melbourne struggled to make a profit - both making only $10,000 over their reserves.

Meanwhile, the golden couple - Josh and Charlotte from Sydney have been dating for five years and renting an apartment together in Manly for the past six months. 

The 26-year-old carpenter and his partner, Ms Ekas who is a 25-year-old food stylist decided to go onto the reality show to make some money so they could buy their first home.

Mr Terrett is no stranger to home renovations before the reality show after building a modern beach house for his parents on the south coast but Ms Ekas revealed she had no experience in renovation.

Despite their differences, the pair appear to work great together on the show and were both stunned when they made it through to the final elimination on the tenth series of The Block.
