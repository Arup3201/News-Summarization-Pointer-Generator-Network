A teenage girl who glued on false nails lost the top of her finger after it rotted away.

Sarah Greenaway, 17, applied her own false nails at home with cosmetic DIY glue bought in Boots - but days later she was rushed to hospital with a serious infection.

Bar worker Miss Greenaway was in agony as the index finger on her right hand turned green and started dying.

Sarah Greenaway, 17, had to have the tip of her finger amputated after it became severely infected. The index finger became infected after she used some nail glue that she bought from Boots

Doctors had to cut off the top of the finger to save her hand - and cut the finger open from tip to palm to clean it out.

Miss Greenaway bought the Â£3.20 Broadway Jet Dry Nail Glue at a Boots store in Pontypool, South Wales.

She said: 'I bought the glue for a set of nails I had at home already. All I wanted was for my nails to look nice.

'But later the next day my finger was really hurting, so I took the nails off.

'My nail had turned a greeny-black colour underneath.

'I went to A&E and they gave me antibiotics. But when they didn't work I was rushed in for surgery.

Miss Greenaway went to hospital with a severe infection in her nail (left). She had to have surgery to remove the tip of her finger (right) and save the rest of it. She also had to have the whole finger opened up and cleaned

Miss Greenaway was also given IV antibiotics to combat the infection

'It was very frightening - I was crying in pain, it was so scary.'

Miss Greenaway had an hour-long operation and was kept in hospital for observation.

She said: 'The pain was still so bad and I was put on a drip for antibiotics.

'Doctors didn't know then if they'd saved my finger. They said it might still have to be amputated.'

While she was in recovery, Miss Greenaway contracted the serious bacterial infection MRSA and had to spend a further two nights in an isolated cubicle at Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport.

The teenager, of Pontypool, is now having physiotherapy sessions to help with getting the use of her finger back.

While Miss Greenaway was in hospital after the operation she also developed MRSA

She said: 'I cannot understand how my finger became so infected. It may have been a bad batch of glue and we are thinking about taking legal action.'

Her mother, Gayle Druce, 40, said: 'It was difficult to see Sarah in such pain.

'It was such a relief that she didn't lose her whole finger.

'For a long time her right hand was very touch sensitive and caused lots of pain, even just placing her finger flat down was terribly sore.'

Now the teen has vowed that she will never wear false nails again.

A spokesman for Boots said: 'It is a matter for the manufacturer. We don't feel able to comment at this time as the customer may pursue a legal case.'

Sarah (pictured in hospital) said: 'Doctors didn't know then if they'd saved my finger. They said it might still have to be amputated'

However, a skin and beauty therapist told MailOnline that it is most likely that the infection was not caused by the glue, but that it was caused by poor nail preparation before the glue was applied.

Louise Thomas-Minns, who owns U And Your Skin, said: 'It's likely to be to do with the application process and the care of the nail.

'I always get very worried about these at home treatments. It's really unfortunate, and I have massive sympathy for that, but it is probably down to her ability in applying it.

'If there is water under the nail that could give rise to an infection. As with many things, its usually consumer error and not being equipped with the right knowledge.

'If the glue hasn't bonded properly, or the nail is wet or dirty before the glue is applied, it allows infection to breed.'

She added that people should always ensure their nails are clean and free of dirt and oil before false nails are applied.

Sarah (pictured with her mother, Gayle Druce) is considering taking legal action against the glue's manufacturer. Image shows how her finger looks now that it has recovered from the amputation
