The Bank of England has been rocked by allegations it turned a blind eye as traders rigged foreign currency rates.

Traders at some of the world’s biggest banks have claimed they told officials in 2012 that they routinely shared sensitive information about currency orders from customers with rivals, which could be used to fix their bets.

Last night Conservative and MPs called for an inquiry into the ‘extremely serious’ allegations.

Notes of the meeting in April 2012 between two officials from Threadneedle Street and currency dealers have already been handed to City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority.

Revelation: The Bank of England is alleged to have known about rigging of foreign currency rates

It is alleged that when confronted with the evidence the Bank of England officials said they had no policy on the practice of sharing foreign currency information and that banks should make their own rules.

Accusations that officials failed to raise the alarm or even condoned the practice are highly damaging for the Bank of England, and come in the midst of a worldwide probe into whether banks rigged the £3 trillion a day foreign currency market.

The sprawling investigation kicked off last year after revelations from whistleblowers from a number of banks.

Those under the spotlight include Barclays, Lloyds and Royal Bank and Scotland - which at least twenty bank traders thought to have been fired or suspended.

Two of those traders, one from Citigroup and another from Swiss giant UBS, were present at the crunch meeting in April 2012.

The Bank of England has already been heavily criticised for being slow to act over the manipulation of ‘Libor’ interest rates, which are used to set anything from the price of mortgages to bets on complex financial instruments.

Investigation: A number of banks are being investigated over the allegations of rigging

Former deputy governor Paul Tucker was forced to deny claims he sanctioned Barclays’s manipulation of Libor, after embarrassing emails were published documenting  his phone calls with disgraced former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond.

Barclays was fined £290million over the Libor scandal in June 2012, with Mr Diamond forced to resign just days later.

Regulators, including the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and Serious Fraud Office, are now investigating  whether banks also conspired to manipulate benchmarks used for giant trades on foreign currency movements.

Whistleblowers have claimed that traders rigged their own bets by pushing the benchmark rate for trades in foreign currency up or down.

This could be achieved by sharing information about currency orders from clients with other banks, shortly before the benchmark rate was set in London at 4pm.  By doing this traders could gain an impression about probable moves in currency markets.

The Bank of England was not responsible for regulating UK lenders until April 2013 but it is supporting the FCA probe.

Last night it refused to confirm nor deny the allegations but published the minutes of the meeting, following a Freedom of Information Act request.

The minutes make a fleeting reference to discussions on rules for foreign currency trading.

Last night, MPs demanded answers from the Bank of England. Mark Garnier,Conservative MP and member of the influential Treasury Select Committee said: ‘There is a question as to whether these traders were sharing market intelligence or colluding to manipulate rates.

If the Bank of England and other regulators let information slip through the net it should be hammered. Individuals must be held accountable.’

Shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie called for a Treasury inquiry.

‘These are extremely serious allegations and we need to know exactly who knew what and when. We need a crack team of enforcers to stamp out wrongdoing, not a team of Keystone Cops.’

A spokesman for the Bank of England said: ‘The Bank of England has already released its record of the April 2012 meeting, and we are continuing to support the FCA in its investigations.’

But officials told banks they should make up own rules about currency rates
