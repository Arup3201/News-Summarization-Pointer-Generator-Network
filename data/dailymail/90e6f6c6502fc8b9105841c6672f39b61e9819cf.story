A woman police chief has come under fire for seeming to defend a colleague who described a shooting victim’s fiancee as ‘some bit of skirt’.

Colette Paul, Bedfordshire’s chief constable, said the comment – made by an investigation during a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary about Luton Police Station – was ‘forgivable’.

The first episode follows the arrest and questioning of a suspect in the shooting of accountant Atif Ali.

Detective Constable Gary Hales is filmed referring to the fiancee of shotgun shooting victim Atif Ali as ‘some bit of skirt’ during an episode of 24 Hours in Police Custody

The 20-part Channel 4 fly-on-the-wall series shows life behind the scenes at Bedfordshire Police, run by Chief Constable Colette Paul and Police Commissioner Olly Martins

Mr Ali, who was blasted with a sawn-off shotgun by a hitman hired by a love rival, said the comments made him feel 'sick' and that they were 'disrespectful'

Mr Ali, who was innocent of any wrongdoing, was blasted with a sawn-off shotgun by a hitman hired by a love rival.

In the Channel 4 programme, Detective Constable Gary Hales is shown referring to Mr Ali’s then fiancee as ‘some bit of skirt’.

He is later filmed saying to colleagues: ‘What’s this girl like then? Is she a bit of a looker? Why would you want to do 15 years in prison?’

Mrs Paul admitted ‘wincing’ when she watched the footage, but insisted: ‘It’s forgivable but not what I would want someone to say.

‘I made it clear when I was asked about some of the language used by officers and staff at the advanced press screening that there are things shown in the series which I do not enjoy seeing. Swearing and off-hand comments about others in the office environment is not what I want to see from my staff. But I do accept that the round-the-clock filming over six weeks in a tough and tiring environment was always going to produce a few moments where officers would express their frustrations and it would make me wince – they are only human.'

Mr Ali, who needed surgery after being shot in the leg, told the Mail he felt ‘sick’ at the comments. He added: ‘If this is true, then I don’t accept it is banter. It is highly disrespectful from someone who is supposed to uphold the highest morals and ethics.’

Detective Constable Martin Hart has been compared to the Office's David Brent for his cringeworthy role in the documentary series, including a moment where he shows a colleague pictures of cheese sauce on a burger that he ate

Mr Hales is also shown squeezing a squeaking rubber chicken when the suspect is charged, saying: ‘It gets squeezed when we get a good result.’

Mrs Paul confirmed that she had spoken to DC Hales about his insensitive remark. She said he had tole her there was no intention to cause offence to Mr Ali or his fiancee, merely a desire to gather evidence.

At the same press conference when Mrs Paul made her comments, it emerged some officers had refused to appear in the programme because they were paying child maintenance and did not want ex-partners to know they had been promoted.

The first episode also shows a female desk sergeant saying she needs to get home ‘before I punch somebody’, while booking in a man who smashed a door at his mother’s home because his games console was broken.

Another officer involved in Mr Ali’s case, Detective Constable Martin Hart, has been compared to The Office’s hapless David Brent following his appearance on the documentary. 

He talks incessantly about a recent holiday to Las Vegas and shows a bored-looking colleague pictures of some cheese sauce he had on a burger.

The 20-part series, 24 Hours in Police Custody, starts at 9pm tonight. It was filmed in April and May by The Garden Productions, which was behind Channel 4’s 24 Hours in A&E.

Future episodes will cover issues such as child sex abuse, domestic violence and drugs. The force waived any control over content except in two cases because of ‘family and legal reasons’.

Last week it emerged Bedfordshire’s deputy police and crime commissioner, Tafheen Sharif, 32, was forced to step down after she attempted to gag the court in Mr Ali’s case. She tried to prevent his ex-fiancee – a distant cousin of hers – being named in coverage.
