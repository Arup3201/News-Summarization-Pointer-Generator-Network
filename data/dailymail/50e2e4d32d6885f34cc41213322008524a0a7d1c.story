Swirling darkly over the sea, this twister has the power to toss aside swimmers, boats and even aircraft that cross its path.

But for the sailors on board the towering column of water wasn’t a Hollywood film - but nature at its most terrifying.

This enormous water tornado passed off the Italian coast, narrowly avoiding hitting a giant container ship.

Close call: This twister passed so close to the ship pictured that it appeared to be towering over it

The tornadoes, known also as water spouts, are a serious marine hazard and can pose a deadly threat to boats, swimmers and even aircraft in their path.

Inside the twister, winds reach speeds of up to 80 miles an hour. Sea-life has been known to be sucked up and dumped on land.

Dwarfed by the enormous dark grey vortex of water the ship escaped the potentially deadly impact by minutes, witnesses said.

Photographer Francesco Magoga, who captured the remarkable image off the coast of Genoa in north-west Italy, said: ‘ It must have been this captain’s lucky day, as the tanker only missed it by ten minutes’.

Near miss: Water spouts are a serious marine hazard and can pose a deadly threat to boats and swimmers

Waterspouts are a natural phenomenon that occurs when tornadoes form over oceans, lakes and rivers. They number about 15 a year in Italy, with around 160 across Europe.

The intense funnels are formed when layers of cool air blowing over the water cause warm, moist air to sweep up from underneath, forming a column of condensation.
