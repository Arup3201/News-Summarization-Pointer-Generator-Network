A mother charged with murdering three of her children in a botched murder-suicide attempt had tried to kill herself twice before, it has been revealed.

A report by the Florida Department of Children and Families says an investigator came to the home of Jessica McCarty in Palm Beach, where she admitted taking sleeping pills and muscle relaxers before texting a friend that she was going commit suicide. 

Investigators labeled her three children Laci McCarty, aged seven, six-year-old Philip McCarty and Christopher Swist, aged five months, as being in intermediate danger, reports Wesh.com 

The children's grandmother told investigators that McCarty, 33, had twice before attempted to kill herself.

According to the report, DCF gave the family a brochure, had them sign a safety plan and closed the case.

Sole survivor: Police said Monday five-month-old Christopher Swist (right), died  three days after his mother Jessica McCarty killed his two older siblings in a botched murder-suicide. McCarty (pictured on the left in a suicide-protection vest with bandages on her slashed wrists) survived the attack and was arrested

McCarty was arrested after she called 911 on Friday and told police she'd killed her children. 

Laci and Philip were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night.

The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. 

Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found.

Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children since Friday but lost his fight for life on Monday.

McCarty has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The attempted murder charge could be upgraded.  

'Our hearts go out to the friends and family who have lost children in such a horrific manner. The fathers of these helpless, innocent children struggling is simply gut wrenching,' said acting Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens. 

Police say none of the three murdered children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were discovered

According to Renkens, there had recently been a break in the relationship between McCarty and the youngest child's father, also called Christopher Swist. 

Investigators said McCarty sent photos to Swist of blood throughout the house. Swist arrived first at the scene and found his son unresponsive on his bed, police said.

Police said they found a journal in the driveway of the home that was addressed 'To my family,' which indicated that McCarty was sorry for what she 'had to do.' 

Letter left behind: Investigators say McCarty left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do'. The motive for the attempted murder-suicide is still not clear 

There was also another page addressed to Christopher's father, asking him to keep her son's name alive, police said.

On Sunday, McCarty waived her right to appear at her first hearing, sending her attorney instead. 

In a mugshot provided by the local jail, the troubled mother appears in a suicide-prevention vest with bandages covering her recently-slashed wrists - her mouth agape.  

The motive for the tragic attempted murder-suicide has still not been revealed. 

However, McCarty did have a troubled history and in 2009 was investigated by the DCF for possible child neglect.

The agency recommended McCarty to mental health counseling after that investigation, according to public records. 

She has also been arrested on charges of forgery, shoplifting, and prescription drug abuse. 

Police were first called to the family's residence just before 6pm, when McCarty called 911 to say her three children were dead and that she had cut her wrists. 

Christopher Swist, the father of the infant, also called police when he came home to find the children unconscious in a bedroom.

Disturbing find: McCarty's partner Christopher Swist came home on Friday to find his son (pictured together above) and McCarty's two other children unconscious. The older McCarty children were pronounced dead on Friday. The infant was found with a cord wrapped around his neck and spent the weekend on life support

McCarty allegedly sent pictures of blood inside the home to Swist, leading him to come home and investigate.

When he came home, he found his son with a cord wrapped around his neck and lying on a bed. Philip unresponsive in a corner and Laci unresponsive and wounded on a bed.

An autopsy on the two McCarty children was scheduled for Sunday.

Palm Bay police apprehended McCarty outside her home shortly after she called 911. 

Officers said they had to shoot her with beanbag rounds because she was 'uncooperative' and was armed with a butcher's knife.

McCarty was in the front yard when apprehended, but she 'wasn't showing her hand' after several requests to do so. 

She then showed she was holding a knife and refused to put it down, police said. 

After refusing several requests to put down the knife, police said officers shot McCarty with five to six less-lethal 'beanbag' rounds, which are meant to subdue a person. 

McCarty was treated for her injuries and taken into custody, according to WFTV.

The tragic incident has shaken the community and a prayer vigil for the three murdered children was scheduled for 8pm on Monday night. 

Following news of little Christopher's death, friends of his father started an outpouring of support on Facebook.

According to his profile, Christopher Swist is a former Marine.
