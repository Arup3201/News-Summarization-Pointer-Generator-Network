Leading scientist: Lord Robert Winston (pictured) demanded answers from the Government about how closely they were monitoring the virus

Leading scientist Lord Robert Winston warned today that the risk of Ebola spreading could dramatically increase if it becomes airborne.

At the moment the disease is passed through bodily contact or fluids such as blood and sweat.

But in a House of Lords debate, the fertility doctor demanded answers from the Government about how closely they were monitoring the virus.

Lord Winston said: ‘We know that viruses mutate, we know that the Ebola virus can mutate.

‘We know perfectly well that it is not airborne at the moment, and we know that the pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract cells are unlikely to harbour the virus.

‘However, can you assure us that people are looking at the risk of mutation of this virus so that we can make certain that its mode of transmission does not change?’

Health minister Earl Howe said there was ‘very close monitoring of the virus and the way it mutates’ and insisted the risk to Britons ‘remains low’.

The chief of the UN’s Ebola mission, Anthony Banbury, also warned earlier this month that the virus could become airborne.

He said aid workers were racing against time to control the epidemic in case it mutates in a ‘nightmare scenario’.

Lord Winston spoke as experts warned the escalating Ebola crisis could see more than 10,000 new cases of the deadly virus in West Africa every week.

The World Health Organisation predicted the spread of the ‘horrible, unforgiving disease’ may accelerate over the next two months.

There have been more than 8,900 official cases since the outbreak started in March, killing 4,450 people.

But the WHO’s assistant director general, Bruce Aylward, said that by the first week in December, WHO projections suggest there may be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases a week.

Meanwhile screening to counter the threat from Ebola started at Britain's biggest airport today amid doubts over how the checks are being enforced.

The first passengers arriving at Heathrow Terminal 1 after taking indirect flights from West Africa have been questioned to establish any potential exposure to the disease, and had their temperature taken.

The system is expected to be extended to Gatwick and St Pancras Eurostar station over the next week.

However Public Health England (PHE) and Border Force officials admitted there is no fixed plan to deal with people who have visited affected countries, but decline to give details or have their temperature taken.
