The building that houses the world's biggest commercial gold vault is up for sale.

JP Morgan's 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza is now on the market with a price tag expected to be close to $1 billion.

The 60-floor skyscraper was built in 1961 and is the 15th tallest building in New York City but it is what lays below ground that captures the imagination.

Some 90 feet below street level is where the formerly secret JPM gold vault is located.

Striking gold: The New York skyscraper that holds the worlds largest gold vault is on the market. 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza was built in the 1950s. The vault is 90ft underground

On the move: 4,000 of JP Morgan Chase workers will have to relocate one the building is sold

The building that was built by David Rockefeller in the late 1950s was the headquarters of the once-legendary Chase Manhattan corporation.

When it was completed, the building was the world's sixth tallest building.

One of the building architects wrote that underneath the skyscraper is the '...largest bank vault in the world, longer than a football field.'

More information about the vault can be found in a book that was written by one of the architects.

It describes how the vault was anchored to the bedrock with steel rods.

Hidden: There are no clues on the surface as to the size or amount of gold held in the enormous vault below

Gold: The vault at 1 Chase Plaza lays some 90ft below street level and rests on Manhattan bedrock making it virtually indestructible

Reach for the skies: The building is New York City's 15th tallest building with 60 floors at a height of 813 feet

This was to prevent the watertight, concrete structure from floating to the surface like a huge bubble in the event that an atomic bomb falling in the bay would blow away the building and flood the area.

In other words, the world's biggest bank vault, that belonging to the private Chase Manhattan empire, and then, to JPMorgan, was so safe, the creators even had a plan of action should it sustain a near-direct hit from a nuclear bomb, and suffer epic flooding (such as that from Hurricane Sandy).

Conveniently, across the street lays the Federal Reserve Bank of New York - the largest gold repository in the world.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. currently occupies about half of the 2.2 million-square-foot building. It means their 4,000 employees will have to be re-located elsewhere.

Building with potential: There are suggestions the building could be turned into a hotel, shops and apartments. Some have suggested the vault would make a nice restaurant!

Up for grabs: The building was for sale once before but was pulled after the market crashed in 2008

The building was up for sale once before, in 2008, after the market crash. The sale was eventually pulled after real estate prices plummeted.

The offering of the tower, a city landmark designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft, will test the downtown office market.

Shrinking financial companies have left lower Manhattan landlords with at least 6.3 million square feet of space to fill, according to data from Newmark Knight Frank Grubb.

The tower may achieve its highest value as a mixed-use property with a hotel, restaurant and apartments all possibilities.

The skyscraper was designated a landmark in 2008 by the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission.
