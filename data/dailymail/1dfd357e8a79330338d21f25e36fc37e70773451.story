Brazilian sensation Neymar has scored a catalogue of stunning goals during his relatively brief career, but few will compare to his latest outrageous effort.

The Barcelona forward captained a side of his friends against a side of Brazilian star Nene's friends in a charity match 'Ball Hunger Only' in Jundai, Sao Paulo on Monday - where he stole the show with an individual piece of skill that simply took the breath away.

The game had only been playing five minutes when the 22-year-old collected a shot that had rebounded off the post before 'rainbow flicking' the ball over a bemused defender's header, performing a little pirouette and bursting through to chip the keeper.

Even in a star-studded side that featured the likes of Kaka, Cafu and Lucas Moura, Neymar's sublime skills and imagination shone brightest.

Brazil's golden boy also shared the love later in the game when he went past the keeper only to stop the ball on the goalline for his friend Kaka tpo nudge home before the pair took a diving celebration together across the rain soaked pitch.
