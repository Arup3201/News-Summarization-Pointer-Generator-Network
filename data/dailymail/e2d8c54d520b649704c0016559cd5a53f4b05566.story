A simple medical technique could have prevented the death of Michael Jackson, a leading anaesthesiologist told jurors today.

Doctor Steven Shafer said lifting the chin of a patient under anaesthetic  to clear the airwaves should be the first thing a doctor tries to revive someone who has stopped breathing.

The jury in the trial of Dr Conrad Murray, Jackson's private doctor, was also shown a dramatic video
re-enacting how the singer stopped breathing after taking a deadly 
cocktail of drugs to help him sleep.

Dr Shafer, an Ivy League professor, told 
Los Angeles Superior Court that Murray didn't try the life-saving 
technique after Jackson stopped breathing on June 25, 2009 at his home.

Murray has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

Dr Shafer said: 'The most likely thing that happened was that his airways were obstructed. Michael Jackson was trying to breath but his tongue got stuck in the back of his throat.

'A simple chin lift or the use of an instrument to move the tongue may well have been all that was needed to save his life.'

Prosecutors claimed that Murray returned to the singer's bedroom after going to the toilet for two minutes to find his famous patient had stopped breathing and immediately began CPR.

The Columbia University professor listed a series of 'egregious' violations in the care of the singer,  including the failure to have a machine with an alarm to check Jackson's pulse.

Professional opinion: Dr Shafer, an Ivy League professor, criticised Jackson's private doctor Dr Murray for the lack of equipment at the home of the singer and failure to use basic life-saving techniques

Dr Shafer, a world expert in Propofol, said he was giving evidence for free at the trial because he wanted to defend the reputation of other doctors

If Murray had the appropriate machine 'it would have saved Michael Jackson's life'.

Dr
Shafer said: 'Michael Jackson died because he stopped breathing - that 
is expected when you administer intravenous sedatives. You just have to 
open the airways so oxygen can get through.'

He also told the court there was no evidence that Jackson was advised not to eat or drink anything for eight or nine hours before being given the powerful sedative Propofol.

Dr Shafer, a world expert on Propofol, added: 'He was not at average risk, he was at greatly increased risk of vomiting and having it go back into his lungs.'

He criticised Murray for having no suction equipment in Jackson's bedroom, telling the jury that the smallest amount of vomit in the lungs could prove fatal.

The lack of an infusion pump to control the administration of Propofol could have also have caused a lethal overdose.

The jury was shown a re-enactment of how the singer stopped breathing after taking a cocktail of drugs.

The
film showed an actor suffering a cardiac arrest after being 
administered with Propofol, the powerful hospital anaesthetic blamed for
Jackson's death. Life-saving techniques were demonstrated including CPR
and attempts to ventilate the lungs.

Some of the more shocking elements were cut from the film following complaints from Dr Murray's defence lawyers.

The mock collapse in the video ends with the patient being saved by doctors.

In the public gallery, Jackson's mother Katherine, could be seen shaking her head as she saw how efficiently the doctors in the video worked to revive their patient with the proper equipment and a team of staff.

Prosecutors screened the video to show the jury how Propofol is administered in a hospital setting.

Defence lawyer Ed Chernoff objected 
to the screening, claiming it was a 'terrifying dramatisation of someone
suffering a cardiac arrest'. He said it was being shown to try to 
inflame the jury.

He 
was overruled by Judge Michael Pastor, who nevertheless agreed to censor
some of the more powerful scenes, including some in slow motion, saying
they were irrelevant.

The
silent video was taken inside an operating theatre. An anaesthesiologist is shown administering Propofol.

Prosecutors have accused Murray, 58, 
of being woefully unprepared when he administered Propofol to Jackson to
treat the 50-year-old performer's chronic insomnia.

Experts
have accused Murray of delaying too long before calling for help after 
discovering Jackson had stopped breathing and not having vital equipment
on standby.

The video, 'An Overview of the Safe 
Administration of Propofol', was shown during the testimony of the 
prosecution's final witness, top anaesthesiologist Dr Steven Shafer.

Dr Shafer made the video and gave a running commentary on how the patient should be treated in an appropriate hospital setting.

He insisted all the steps and equipment should be used 'every time for every patient - no exception'.

Dr Shafer added that he was giving evidence for free because he was worried that the reputation of other doctors and anaesthesiologists would be tarnished by the trial.

He said: 'Every day I am asked, ''Are you going to give me the drug that killed Michael Jackson?'''

'Propofol is an outstanding drug. I want people to know that when people are given this drug by people who know what they are doing it is safe.'

The trial continues.
