Every single member of the boyband One Direction are considered more influential in the UK than the Prime Minister, the Mayor of London and a number of other high-profile politicians and journalists, according to a new Twitter index.

Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson each scored 98 out of a possible 100 in terms of influence, with Zayn Malik in fifth place on 97.

The scores are calculated based on how much other Twitter users retweet and engage with the tweeter and isn’t based purely on how many followers they have.

One Direction members (from left to right) Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Harry Styles and Liam Payne are the top five most influential tweeters in the UK according to research from London-based media monitoring firm PeerIndex. Payne topped the list

Prime Minister David Cameron, for example, scored the same amount of points as Zayn Malik but has fewer than 500k followers, compared to the 3 million or more of Piers Morgan behind him in eighth place.

The rest of the top 10 is made up of musician Ed Sheeran, columnist Caitlin Moran and comedian Ricky Gervais.

PeerIndex studied over 10 billion tweets from 150 million people to compile the Twitter 140.

For the ratings, Peerindex focused on whether other people in the UK were responding to, retweeting or engaging with a tweeter.

2 @Harry_Styles: Harry Styles scored 98 and has 15.4 million followers

3 @NiallOfficial: Niall Horan scored 98 and has 13.4 million followers

4 @Louis_Tomlinson: Louis Tomlinson scored 98 and has 12.2 million followers

5 @zaynmalik: Zayn Malik scored 97 and has 9.9 million followers

6 @edsheeran: Ed Sheeran scored 97 and has 7.4 million followers

7 @David_Cameron: David Cameron scored 97 and has 0.4 million followers

8 @PiersMorgan: Piers Morgan scored 97 and has 3.6 million followers

9 @caitlinmoran: Caitlin Moran scored 96 and has 0.4 million followers

10 @rickygervais: Ricky Gervais scored 96 and has 4.9 million followers

Each tweeter was then assigned a UK π-score (Pi-score) from 1 to 100 using the a specially-created algorithm called PiQ.

It then filtered out all tweeters based outside of the UK.

All of the Top 140 have scores above 92 and the Uk π-score is an influence score in the context of the UK Twitter sphere.

The research also assessed who the people engaging with an influencer were. For example, a retweet from someone highly influential is worth more than a retweet from an average Twitter user.

PeerIndex excluded corporate and brand accounts, such as newspapers as well as parody accounts.

It also ruled out journalists from the main national newspapers because it plans to produce a separate journalist table in the future. 

A number of people on the list aren’t based in the UK but were included because they have a strong influence in Great Britain.

These include Piers Morgan, as well as South African video blogger Caspar Lee and singer and entrepreneur will.i.am.

The report is the third annual Twitter 140 list created by London-based PeerIndex.

'As Twitter has become more mainstream, the top 140 starts to resemble the contours of popular culture and power, the footballers, politicians and boy bands,' said PeerIndex founder Azeem Azhar.

'Twitter is so rich and vast, that subcultures co-exist on it, often without knowing about each other,' said Azhar. "For example, even though more than 900, 000 people follow both George Osborne, the chancellor, and Rylan, the reality TV celebrity, they only share six followers in common.'
