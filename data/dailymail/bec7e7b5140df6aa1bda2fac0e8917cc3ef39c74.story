He wants to become Chancellor of the Exchequer.

But this morning Ed Balls admitted that he relies on his mother-in-law June for help with maths.

At the end of an interview on Good Morning Britain, Labour’s shadow chancellor said he was relieved he had not been asked to answer any maths questions live on TV.

Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls told Good Morning Britain his mother was the family's maths brain

Last month during an interview on the ITV breakfast show, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was left embarrassed when she refused to answer what 7x8 is.

After appearing on the programme this morning to discuss George Osborne’s Budget, Mr Balls told host Susanna Reid: ‘I was pleased you didn’t ask me any maths questions this morning, that was my…’

Asked how he was with fractions, Mr Balls replied: ‘Luckily my mother-in-law is a maths teacher so she is the expert when it comes to maths.’

A shocked Miss Reid interrupted: ‘You cannot tell me that the shadow chancellor relies on this mother in law to do his maths.’

He added: ‘The kids think the mother-in-law is very good at maths teaching. You always rely on your mother in law.’

Good Morning Britain host Susanna Reid asked Mr Balls if he really left all the maths questions to his mother in law. He replied: 'You always rely on your mother-in-law'

The morning after the Budget, Mr Balls warned that Mr Osborne's plan for cuts was ‘a pretty scary prospect’ for voters

Mr Balls has three children with his wife, Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. Her mother June, is a maths teacher and her father, Tony, a trade unionist.

After working as an adviser to Gordon Brown at the Treasury, Mr Balls was elected as an MP in 2005 and became shadow chancellor in 2011.

He previously worked at the Financial Times and taught economics at Harvard University.

Last month Mrs Morgan refused to do mental arithmetic during an appearance on Good Morning Britain to discuss plans to improve the performance of schools in England.

When asked what the answer to 7x8 is, she said: ‘I'm not going to be answering any maths questions.’

Mr Balls warned that Mr Osborne's plan for cuts was ‘a pretty scary prospect’ for voters.

‘For all his boasts, people are worse-off than they were and the squeeze on living standards has been very severe,’ Mr Balls later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

‘If you look at his plans for the next parliament, as the independent OBR say, the cuts in public spending under the Osborne plan are more severe in the next three years than in the last five.

‘His desire to get to an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts in the next three years to our police, our defence forces than we've seen in the last few years.

‘I don't think those cuts are going to be possible for George Osborne. He's going to end up either cutting our National Health Service or raising VAT.

‘The truth at the election will be, do you want Labour's more balanced, fairer approach to deficit reduction, which focuses on raising wages and being fair, or do you want to go for even deeper spending cuts over the next three years?’
