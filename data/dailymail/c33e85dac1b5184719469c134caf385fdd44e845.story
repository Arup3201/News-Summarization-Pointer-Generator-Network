A man who confessed to 
bludgeoning a nine-year-old girl to death then dismembering her body three 
days before Christmas pleaded guilty today after prosecutors said they 
would ask for the death penalty.

Michael Plumadore, 39, from Indiana, also pleaded guilty to
abuse of a corpse and removing a dead body from the scene in Aliahna 
Maroney-Lemmon's December 22 death at a Fort Wayne trailer park.

He'll be 
sentenced June 18 to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Death: Michael Plumadore, left, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told police he 'killed Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon', right, who weighed just 41lbs, in the early hours of December 22 before dismembering her

Plumadore's attorneys and prosecutors 
had told the judge last week they were ready for his trial to start that
day.

But defense attorney Anthony Churchward said today that they 
agreed to the guilty pleas after prosecutors indicated they would pursue
the death penalty if Plumadore was convicted by trial.

Plumadore was looking after Aliahna and 
her six-year-old sister because their mother was sick. He was a trusted 
family friend who had looked after Aliahna's dying grandfather at the 
trailer park where the family lived.

The grandfather - who died three weeks before the girl's death - was a convicted sex offender. The family moved to the trailer park - where 15 sex offenders lived - to take care of him in his final days.

Plumadore told police he repeatedly hit Aliahna in the head with a brick, chopped up her 
body with a hack saw, stashed her head, hands and feet in the trailer 
where he lived and dumped the rest of her remains nearby.

She weighed only 41 pounds when she died. The other 
girls weren't harmed.

Horrifying: Michael Plumadore poses next to the chair he where says little Aliahna Lemmon was last sleeping. Authorities say he had already killed her and her body parts were in his freezer at the time of this photo

Plumadore has previously been convicted of trespassing, assault and forgery in three different states and there had been a warrant out for his arrest 11 years before the murder. He was charged with battery of a first-responder in 2000 and was given felony probation.

But he failed to report to his probation officer, fulfill his community service hours or complete an anger management course. Plumadore was reported an absconder in June 2000.

Greg Shumaker, one of 15 convicted sex offenders who lives at the park, recalled Aliahna's family moving to the trailer park to help take care of 66-year-old James E 'Shorty' Lemmon.

Frightening: According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes

Sadness: Tarah Souders, mother of Aliahna, is pushed in a wheelchair by step-grandfather David Story and reacts in front of a memorial outside of a mobile home after her daughter's death

Convicted: James Lemmon, Aliahna's grandfather, was convicted of child molesting

Mr Shumaker said he introduced Plumadore
to Mr Lemmon shortly after Plumadore moved into the trailer park, and 
Plumadore moved in with Mr Lemmon a few days later.

Mr Shumaker said he knew Mr Lemmon because they were both sex offenders and were in jail together. Plumadore is not a registered sex offender in Indiana.

But Mr Lemmon had assured Ms Souders that there was nothing to worry about, Mr Shumaker said.

Paulette Hair, 45, a former manager at the trailer park who lives at a nearby trailer park, said she also knew Mr Lemmon was a sex offender. 'He stayed out of everybody's way,' she said.

Mr Shumaker said Plumadore briefly moved away, but returned when Ms Souders, 28, asked him to care for her father.

Aliahna's
father, Dawayne Maroney of Centerville, Iowa, said he knew Plumadore 
through Ms Souders and had no reason to distrust him.

'I
can't talk about it because I'm still coping with it. It's too hard to 
talk about,' he said. 'I had no reason to suspect anything.'
