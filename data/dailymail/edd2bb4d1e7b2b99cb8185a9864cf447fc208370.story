When quadriplegic James Gribble broke his neck four years ago, the ‘golf obsessive’ refused to accept a world without putting on the green.

After being told he would never walk again, the 35 year-old's unwavering persistence over two years led him to an unbelievable recovery where he can now walk small distances on crutches.

But this made playing golf a very tedious process until Mr Gribble discovered the Paragolfer and became the driving force behind bringing the $35,000 German-designed cart to the Moore Park golf course in Sydney – the only one for public hire in Australia.

Now Mr Gribble plays the game he loves at least once a week and was part of an Australian team that took out the inaugural World Cup of Disabled Golf held in South Africa last month.

‘After breaking my neck four years ago not knowing if I'd even survive, words can't express how amazing it felt to be upright and swinging a golf club for the very first time,’ he said.

The Hunters Hill resident broke his C4 and C5 vertebrae when he fell backwards off a stool while backpacking in Africa almost four years ago.

‘It’s given me back a massive part of what I lost after the accident,’ he said. 'To be standing up and enjoying a round with my mates is incredible…the banter, the competition, and being able to access the outdoors are probably the three biggest things.’

Now a Moore Park golf accessibility ambassador and the founder of Empower Golf Australia founder, Mr Gribble said his dream was to have a Paragolfer at every course across the country.

‘Golf is a very unique sport - it is the only sport out there with a unique handicap system which allows people with any form of ability, age or gender to compete – there’s no other sport on the planet that replicates that,’ he said. ‘Almost six per cent of  population in Australia play golf – by far the biggest ball sport in the country - we also have more golf courses per capita than almost anywhere else in the world yet historically very few disabled golfers.'

Mr Gribble was also instrumental in the $1 million refurbishments and accessibility upgrades at the course and its facilities including a new accessibility ramp and a unisex disabled toilet.

‘With the combination of automated tees and the Paragolfer, Moore Park Golf is set to become one of the most accessible and accommodating public golf facility in Australia for golfers with disabilities,’ he said.

He said now that golf has been included as an Olympic event for Rio in 2016 there was no reason why it couldn't also be added to the Paralympic program.

Empower Golf Australia, is a new organisation started by Mr Gribble, which is committed to facilitating and promoting golf for less able Australians. For more information or to donate go to: empowergolf.com.au

Mr Gribble, who used to play off four before the accident, hopes to have a handicap of 20 by the end of the year
