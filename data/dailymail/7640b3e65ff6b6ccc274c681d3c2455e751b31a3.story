A Malaysian bank officer and her husband have been arrested in Malaysia after allegedly stealing more than $30,000 from four passengers aboard the doomed MH370 flight.

Five months after the Malaysia Airlines flight went missing, mysterious withdrawals totaling 110,643 ringgit (AU$37,464) were taken from the accounts of two Malaysian and two Chinese MH370 victims.

The couple have been held in police custody since Thursday and police are also looking for another suspect, a Pakistani man, who is believed to have received part of the money through an online transfer into his account.

District police chief in Kuala Lumpur Zainuddin Ahmad said they believe the man is still in the country and declined to name the bank, where the woman in custody reportedly worked at for the last 10 years, according to news.com.au.

'But as to the full particulars of the case — it’s all still under investigation,' Mr Zainuddin told AFP.

The Mirror reports the 33-year-old works at HSBC and her husband were held after a manager noticed suspicious activity at a Kuala Lumpur branch.

A bank in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, reported the apparent discrepancies in their accounts on July 18, before lodging a police complaint, Assistant Commissioner to the crime investigation department Izany Abdul Ghany revealed.

Mystery: £20,916 cash has been reported missing from the accounts of four MH370 passengers 

It comes as the search team prepares to conduct a deep-water search across 60,000 square kilometres of the Indian Ocean.

According to reports, the transactions were made on July 18 when money from the accounts of three passengers was transferred to the account of a fourth passenger before it was removed.

'We are investigating the case as unauthorised access with intent to commit an offence,' Izany said, according to the Mirror.

'We are getting CCTV footage from the bank to identify the suspects involved.'

A source told the New Straits Times: 'We believe the suspect withdrew the money through the fourth victim's account via several automated teller machines (ATMs) in the Klang Valley.'

Search continues: Officials claim they are 'making progress' as they continue to scour 60,000 sq km of sea for the plane. The orange line indicates 'high priority' search areas; the yellow has been searched already

Efforts to locate Flight MH370 have spanned more than five months, making it one of the most expensive searches for a plane in aviation history.

The Joint Agency Coordination Centre claims the rescue operation is making 'good progress'.

Teams are still scanned a 60,000-square-kilometre area in the Indian Ocean, with a deep-water search planned for September.

Flight 370 disappeared mysteriously in March with 239 people on board after diverging from its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Confusion: The search started near Thailand but has since moved south. Hopes were ignited after satellite images from the new search area appeared to show parts of a plane in the water, but it turned out to be debris

The airline was widely criticised for its handling of the crisis. 

In a desperate bid to save face following two major disasters within months, bosses are now considering rebranding the airline.

Officials said they are looking at a number of options to restructure the business which could include changing its name.

Among the other changes the Malaysian flag carrier is considering are new routes and expanding out-sourcing to increase profitability.

It follows the death of 298 passengers after flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine on July 17 and the disappearance of flight MH370 on March 8, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew.

The Malaysian flag carrier will also seek new investors to rebuild its business.
