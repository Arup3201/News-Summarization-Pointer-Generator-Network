Gareth Barry says he has not given up hope of an England recall and believes Jack Wilshere has a lot to learn if he is to become the Three Lions' answer in defensive midfield.

Barry hasn't featured for his country since playing in a friendly against Norway in May 2012, with boss Roy Hodgson opting to name instead the likes of Wilshere, Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph as he plans for the future.

Hodgson's chosen 4-4-2 diamond formation for their Euro 2016 qualifiers has seen Wilshere picked at the base of midfield - a position that doesn't appear natural to the Arsenal star.

Everton midfielder Gareth Barry says he has not given up hope of playing for England again in the future

Barry's last international cap was in May 2012 when England took on Norway in a friendly in Oslo

Caps: 53

Goals: Three 

Senior debut: 31/05/00 vs Ukraine

Last match: 26/05/12 vs Norway

International tournaments: Euro 2000 (didn't play), 2010 World Cup 

With Steven Gerrard's retirement from international football after the World Cup, and with Michael Carrick out injured, there is a currently a lack of natural English talent in this position.

Barry, who has 53 caps for his country, has been performing this role diligently for Everton and the 33-year-old believes his experience in this position can be an added bonus to the national team and Wilshere in particular.

'We do not have lots of holding midfielders. I'm not sure what the situation is with Michael Carrick, but Steven Gerrard is retired, so there is a place for someone,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

'If Jack [Wilshere] is going to do it, there is a lot to learn, but he had a very good game last week, although I am sure he will admit himself he has a lot to learn.

Barry said Jack Wilshere still has a lot to learn if he wants to be England's new defensive midfielder

'It is a disciplined role, where it is as much what you do off the ball as on it. The link play is the biggest thing but being in the right place to stop counter attacks is also vital.' he added.

Barry, who penned a three-year deal at Everton in July following an exceptional loan spell at Goodison Park last term, also revealed he turned down offers from three or four Premier League teams as well as a lucrative offer to join new MLS franchise New York City.

The former Aston Villa and Manchester City man has endured an inconsistent start to the season since joining the Toffees permanently with the club lying 17th in the Premier League and two points above the drop zone.

Roberto Martinez's side will be looking to kick-start their season when they entertain Barry's former side Villa on Saturday afternoon.
