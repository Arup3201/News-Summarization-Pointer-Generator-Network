Kingsman David Robert Shaw who died in hospital yesterday after he was wounded in Afghanistan

A British soldier who died in hospital yesterday after he was wounded in Afghanistan was someone who would 'make time for a hug for everybody', his family said today.

Kingsman David Robert Shaw, from 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancasterâ€™s Regiment, was shot when his checkpoint came under attack from insurgents in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand Province on Monday.

The 23-year-old was flown back to the UK for treatment but died yesterday at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

His family paid tribute to Kingsman Shaw today, saying: 'He will be missed and never forgotten.'

In a statement issued through the Ministry of Defence (MoD), his family said: 'David was a much-loved son and brother who was proud to have served his country in the 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.

'He loved his family and friends and would always make time for a hug for everybody.

'He enjoyed playing football, running and was an Arsenal fan. He also followed his local team, Barrow AFC.

'He has touched many lives. He will be missed and never forgotten.'

Known in his battalion as 'Doctor S', Kingsman Shaw, from Barrow-in-Furness, joined the army in February 2008 and after training was posted to 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.

He was first deployed to Afghanistan in March 2010 with Corunna Company, and returned last October as an Assault Pioneer as well as a qualified sharpshooter, the MoD said.

In one incident, he gave first aid to four local children who had fallen into a canal after a vehicle accident, showing actions 'of the highest calibre'.

Lieutenant Colonel Nick Wood, commanding officer of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, described his death as a 'devastating tragedy'.

'David was a true Cumbrian and Kingsman: physically and mentally tough, a warrior through and through, utterly loyal to those he worked with and possessing a sense of humour that touched us all,' he said.

'Known throughout the Battalion as 'Doctor S', he was the most popular of individuals. His joking and light-heartedness would lift the gloomiest of situations and have us all laughing. He was someone we all wanted to be with and have around.

'Highly experienced in operating in Afghanistan, he was conducting his second tour, having previously served here in 2010.

'Both times he deployed regularly into some of the most dangerous parts of the country but was unflinching in his bravery and courage.'

He said the 23-year-old's ability to inspire people marked him out as a future leader.

'Everyone wanted to be next to David on patrol as they knew he would be there for them.

'As one of the more senior Kingsmen in his platoon, he took pride in helping those junior to him through challenging times, and there were plenty. Such unselfishness was something that we all aspire to.

'The loss of David has left a gaping hole in the battalion and in our lives. Our memories of him will make us laugh and cry and renew our resolve to succeed with the mission - his sacrifice will not have been in vain.'

Major Mark McLellan, officer commanding Corunna Company, 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, said Kingsman Shaw had been selected to attend a potential junior NCOs cadre, where he would have 'done very well'.

He said: 'Kingsman Shaw had been through some of the fiercest fighting we have seen as a company and always came out the other side smiling and cracking jokes.

'He had the ability to raise morale just by being in the room and his loss is keenly felt across the whole battalion as there are few people who did not know him.'

He said Corunna Company had been left hollow and saddened by the loss, but that would 'only be a shadow' of what Kingsman Shaw's family must be feeling.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Kingsman David Robert Shaw.

'He has been praised by his colleagues as a highly-skilled and capable soldier whose loss will be felt deeply by all who knew him.

'My thoughts are with his family, loved ones and those he served alongside in the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.'

Kingsman Shaw, who joined the army in February 2008, is the second British serviceman to be killed in Afghanistan this year.

His death takes to 440 the number of UK service members who have lost their lives since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001.
