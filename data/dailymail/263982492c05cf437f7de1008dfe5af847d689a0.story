Gesticulating wildly on the witness stand Thursday, a grimacing and sobbing Ana Trujillo told the jurors that she stabbed her boyfriend with a stiletto heel to save her own life.  

Trujillo, 45, took the witness stand in Houston, Texas for the first time during the two-week trial as part of the punishment phase, which will determine her sentence. She faces the possibility of life in prison.

The jury convicted Trujillo Tuesday of murder in last June's killing of 59-year-old Alf Stefan Andersson at his home. Prosecutors say she pinned him down and stabbed him at least 25 times with the five-and-a-half inch heel of her shoe.

Blood on her hands: Trujillo testified that she did not realize how badly she injured her boyfriend until she looked at her gore-covered hands

Trujillo's attorneys say Andersson attacked her and she defended herself with the only weapon she had available, her shoe.

During
 more than five hours of rambling testimony by mid-afternoon, Trujillo 
said that she had been repeatedly abused by men, including sexual 
assault by her first husband.

Trujillo told jurors Andersson became enraged and she fought for her life during a fight that lasted more than an hour.

She said she tried to calm him down, but Andersson started yelling at her and Trujillo realized she could not talk him down.

‘I
 became frightened. I did fear for my life. I felt he lost it,’ she 
said, adding that she started striking him with the shoe anywhere she 
could.

‘Why did you keep on hitting him?’ her attorney Jack Carroll asked.

‘He wouldn't let go of my leg. The pain wouldn't stop,’ she said.

Trujillo said that at first she hit him on his back and on his arms, then on his head as a last resort.

‘I had no idea I was hurting him that 
badly,’ she said. ‘I reached over and said, “Oh God, what happened?” I 
reached over and my hands were full of blood.’

She
 also told jurors that Andersson was a heavy drinker who refused to eat 
and whose mental and physical health began to deteriorate.

She said she became afraid of him because at night he would wake up angry, disoriented and start yelling.

When
 asked by her lawyer, Mr Carroll, why she didn't leave Andersson, 
Trujillo said: 'Because I loved him and I wanted him to get better. I 
wanted him to stop drinking so much.'

But during the testimony, Trujillo did not discuss Andersson in great detail.

During often meandering testimony, 
Trujillo told jurors she had a history of being sexually or physically 
abused by men. She said she had been sexually assaulted by her first 
husband and told jurors that another boyfriend had kicked her in the 
stomach when she was pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage.

Trujillo was found guilty this week of killing Alf Stefan Andersson with her stiletto shoe

Trujillo described being attacked in an incident reminiscent of Andersson's slaying. She told jurors a friend in 2009 had tried to rape her in his apartment, pinning her down and that she used the only weapon within reach - a candlestick - to fend him off.

Trujillo's former friend testified on Wednesday that it was Trujillo who knocked him out with the candlestick in an unprovoked attack. No charges were filed related to that incident.

She also discussed her upbringing, including growing up in Arizona after being born in Mexico, and her various jobs, including massage therapist, club bouncer and artist.

At times during her verbose testimony, prosecutor John Jordan would ask the judge to instruct Trujillo to not answer her lawyer's questions in the form of narration.

Trujillo's attorney has not yet questioned her in detail about the night Andersson died.

On Wednesday, prosecutors presented 19 witnesses during the trial's punishment phase. Most of the witnesses detailed Trujillo's criminal history or firsthand experiences in which she became violent toward them when she drank. Trujillo was arrested twice for drunken driving, once in 2008 and again in 2010.

A psychologist testifying for the defense told jurors Trujillo had been in a series of violent or abusive relationships, including with Andersson, and she was acting in self-defense on the night of the slaying.

Jurors on Wednesday also heard from Anderson's family and friends, who testified that he was a good person who wouldn't hesitate to help anyone and that they were still trying to understand his violent death.
