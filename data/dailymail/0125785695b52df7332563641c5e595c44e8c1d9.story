The misogynistic character was officially killed off by his creator last month after a storm of accusations over sexism.

However, Daniel O'Reilly's Dapper Laughs could soon be coaxed out of retirement after making the nominees for Best Breakthrough Act at next February's Brit Awards.

The comedian from Clapham, south London, is on the longlist along with more than 90 other acts after his single Proper Moist made it into the Top 20 in the singles chart earlier this year

Dapper Laughs is on long list of candidates for Best Breakthrough Act for his song Proper Moist

The Dapper Laughs character was axed after thousands of Britons petitioned to have his show banned from ITVBe.

The  nomination has been awarded on a technicality - bands and solo artists are eligible for a place on the list if they have had a single or album in the Top 40 in the past year.

The only official rule preventing an artist getting onto the list is a  nomination for a Brit Award or track in the charts in a previous year.

Neither the death of a character, nor causing the offence of a nation, are enough to get Dapper Laughs blacklisted from the category. 

A Brit Awards spokesman told the Independent: 'Bands are eligible for British Breakthrough Act category if they have had an Official Charts Company Top 40 single and/or artist album chart success in the current eligibility period.

'They are not eligible if they have previously been nominated in any Brit Award category (excluding Critics’ Choice) or had an Official Charts Company Top 30 single and/or artist album prior to the period.'

A panel of music industry experts will be whittling the current longlist down to five for the shortlist.

The public are then able to choose from the final list in an online vote in the weeks running up to the music event.  

Given that Proper Moist includes lyrics such as, 'If she's looking at me but playing with her hair, By the end of the night she'll need a wheelchair,' it is unlikely that the family-friendly Brits panel will be nominating Dapper for his musical efforts at the 2015 awards.

And even if he was given one of the coveted shortlist slots, it is unknown whether Daniel O'Reilly would turn up at London's O2 for the ceremony. 

Daniel O'Reilly announced he was killing off Dapper Laughs on Newsnight in November

In November, the Londoner declared 'Dapper Laughs is gone,' on BBC's Newsnight after a wave of negative headlines about his comedy routine.

In the same week, the huge backlash against his sexist jokes, which include telling men 'Just show her your penis' and 'If she cries, she’s just playing hard to get,' also saw ITV announce that it would no longer commission his programme On The Pull.

He said at the time: 'I didn't think that so many people would end up seeing it. 

'In the end it became very popular and I kind of got a bit carried away with it, to be honest with you.

'It's wrong but, to me, I didn't see it as me who was saying it, I was creating this character and I was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was popular.

'I thought that the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it.' 

At 2014's Brit Awards, the award was given to the band Bastille.
