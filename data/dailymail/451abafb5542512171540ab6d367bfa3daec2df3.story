A man has been charged in relation to the murder of South Africa captain Senzo Meyiwa, who was shot dead on Sunday night.

The South African Police Service (SAPS) confirmed that a suspect, named as Zenokuhle Mbatha, had been charged and remanded in custody as the investigation into the fatal shooting continues.

Meyiwa, 27, was shot dead at a house in Vosloorus township, near Johannesburg.

Investigators are continuing their search for more suspects after Meyiwa was shot dead by intruders 

The SAPS said on Twitter earlier this week that two gunmen had entered the property, while an accomplice waited outside, before fleeing on foot. The SAPS also revealed that seven people were in the house at the time of the shooting and that they were all being regarded as witnesses.

A statement on Friday from Lieutenant General Solomon Makgale on the SAPS website read: 'Yesterday, after receiving information about a number of suspects, we conducted an identity parade during which some of the witnesses positively identified one person.

'During consultation with the prosecution team, it was decided that this person should be arrested and charged on the basis of the positive identification by some of the witnesses.

'The matter was then placed on the court roll and heard this afternoon. The suspect, Zenokuhle Mbatha, a 25-year-old, has been remanded in custody and will reappear in court on November 11, 2014. We are continuing with our investigations.

'Whilst we are pleased with the progress we are making and the overwhelming support from members of the public, there is still a lot of work to be done to finalise the investigation and ensure that we can link all suspects to the murder. We must emphasise that Mr Mbatha is regarded as a suspect at the moment and we therefore must allow due process of the law to take its course.

'Given the fact that our investigations are at a very sensitive stage, we will only be in a position to update the nation during a media briefing on Monday, November 3, 2014. There are still other suspects outstanding and we appeal to the public to continue providing information in support of the investigation.'

Police admitted there is still a lot of work to be done to bring justice to all suspects linked to the murder

Given the sensitive nature of the investigations, the SAPS will stall investigation updates until November 3
