The real Winston Bright: Kwame Seku (pictured) says he is Winston Bright, a married father of three who disappeared 24 years ago from New York, and has been living in California after suffering from amnesia

A California man claims he suffered amnesia 24 years ago, which caused him to forget his life as a married father of three in New York.

Now 65-year-old Kwame Seku is fighting with a court in New York to prove he is Winston Bright, a telephone-company worker who disappeared at the age of 42 on October 12, 1990.

Seku's goal is to get the pension he earned during his years working at New York Telephone Company, which is now owned by Verizon.

But since Bright was legally ruled dead in 2000, his $617-a-month pension payments have been going to the wife he left behind - and Leslie Bright say she's going to fight him on the claim.

Leslie, now 61, remembers the last time she saw her husband on October 12, 1990.

'He kissed me on the cheek, called me at lunchtime like he always did and again when he was on his way home,' she told the New York Daily News. 'He never made it'

She gave up hope he would return after a fruitless decade-long search.

Seku told the New York Post that he first remembers waking up in San Diego without an ID card and just a few dollars in his pocket sometime between 1991 and 1992.

He didn't remember his name, so he decided to take the African name Kwame after reading it in a magazine.

As Kwame, he started a new life in California by earning his GED and teaching certificate - working in public schools until his retirement.

Seku says he just recently remembered his true identity, with the help of the internet.

'Bits and pieces. You think of places you remember. I had dreams of this and dreams of that and I'd go and investigate it,' he said.

About three years ago, he traveled back to New York where he had a happy reunion with his parents, siblings, three now-adult children and his grandchildren.

The reunion was bittersweet though when he learned the destruction his absence had caused and the fact that two of his sons had served jail time.

Retired life: The 65-year-old is petitioning a New York court to get his pension payments back from his former wife in New York and that he was a blood test to prove he's Bright

'I talked to my daughter, they had a pretty good life when I was there but when I left it became hard times.'

Leslie wasn't happy to see him, and relations with his kids soured too when he tried to get his pension back from his wife.

'Once this Verizon thing hit the fan, that's when it all went downhill,' Seku said.

Initially Verizon started sending him payments, but abruptly stopped when they figured out his wife was also receiving payments.

The company issued a statement, saying they will continue sending payments to Leslie until a court rules on whether Seku is Bright.

A surrogate judge in New York initially threw out Seku's petition for his pension in September 2012 because he didn't have proof he was the legally-dead man.

But in his new petition, Seku is armed with a blood test he says proves he's the son of his mother, Mary Bright, and that entitles him to the payments.

Regardless of whether Seku is Bright, Leslie says she's going to continue to fight to keep the payments because he abandoned her.

'He hasn’t come back to me as his wife or to have a relationship with his children,' she said. 'I will go at him for back child support, cat support, everything! If he wants a fight, I’ll give him a fight!'
