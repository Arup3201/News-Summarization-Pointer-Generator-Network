Like her husband, Angie is just like a fine wine; she just keeps getting better with age. And we wouldn't mind a sip of her style potion, too...

The Maleficent star wowed in a plunging wrap black gown from Versus’ fall 2015 collection, and made a change from her usual fashion choices despite wearing her favourite colour.

The halter neck design drew attention to her slim upper body and she looked ready to hit the runway with her natural hair and make-up in town, putting a high fashion stamp on the designer look. Gorgeous!

She said: 'When I was a kid I was told - like Maleficent - that I was different. But then I realized something: different is good. So maybe you don't fit in. Be yourself. And when someone tells you that you are different just smile and hold your head up, and be proud.'

'And as your villain,' the actress added with a wink, 'I would say, "Cause a little trouble. It is good for you!"'

On Monday night, an article by the movie star was published on the New York Times website.

She detailed her decision to undergo an operation to remove her ovaries in the wake of a cancer scare.

In the deeply personal piece she explained how she would no longer be able to bear children and said that as a result of the operation she was warned to expect 'physical changes' regardless of the hormone replacements she is taking.

The article, titled Angelina Jolie Pitt: Diary Of A Surgery, comes two years after she published an op-ed detailing her decision to have a double mastectomy to prevent the onset of breast cancer.

'I went through what I imagine thousands of other women have felt,' she wrote. 'I told myself to stay calm, to be strong, and that I had no reason to think I wouldn't live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren.'

She continued, detailing her surgery, the side effects, and explaining that as 'it is not possible to remove all risk' she remains 'prone to cancer.'

However, she concluded: 'But I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared.'

Fun for all the family: After celebrating their mother's award, Shiloh and Zahara looked delighted to pose with Nick Jonas 

Enthusiastic: The inspiring actress seemed thrilled to be receiving the award, as she sported a wide grin heading to the stage

The Oscar-winning actress signed off by advocating for preventative care, so women in her position could take control as she did.

'You can seek advice, learn about the options and make choices that are right for you. Knowledge is power.'
