A British woman suffered appalling injuries after falling 50ft from the window of  her Spanish hotel while sleepwalking.

Amy Wigfull, 24, has been on life support in hospital since the accident during a family holiday in Malaga.

She wandered into the bathroom in her sleep and tumbled through a large window. Doctors believe she only survived because her body was so relaxed.

Tragic accident: Amy Wigfull, 24, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is on life support after falling 50ft from a hotel window while sleepwalking. Above, Ms Wigfull is pictured in a Spanish hospital with a male companion

She suffered fractures to her spine, pelvis, ribs and shoulders, as well as a punctured lung and bleeding on the brain.

Despite
 the seriousness of her injuries, she is not paralysed, has movement in 
her limbs and is conscious. However she is likely to need at least four 
operations.

Miss Wigfull, a 
shop display designer, did not have travel insurance but did have a 
European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), which entitles her to free or 
reduced-cost treatment.

But
 precisely when patients are required to start paying remains a grey 
area, and her family have been told they may have to contribute up to 30
 per cent of her £16,000 care costs.

They
 have started fund-raising as a result, and will at least have to pay 
for the air ambulance to take her home to Sheffield, as this is not 
covered by the EHIC.

Merchandising designer: Ms Wigfull was on a family holiday in Malaga when she plunged from the fifth floor. She suffered a broken back, fractured pelvis, broken ribs, and punctured lung, as well as bleeding on the brain

Resort: Ms Wigfull, who is a merchandising display designer at a fashion store, had been in Malaga as part of a 14-strong party of women celebrating her mother Shelley and cousin Clare Duffy's 40th birthdays (file picture)

Miss 
Wigfull was with 13 female family members staying at the four star 
Benalmadena Palace Hotel to celebrate the 40th birthdays of her mother 
and aunt.

Toxicology tests proved she was not under the influence of drugs or drink when she fell from the fifth floor at 2am on Sunday.

Her
 cousin Clare Duffy, 40, said yesterday: ‘We are devastated but we know 
she is lucky to be alive. We can’t believe she has survived. We think 
the fact she was asleep has saved her life. She fell gracefully and 
wasn’t trying to stop herself from falling.’

She
 is being looked after in Hospital Universitario Virgen De La Victoria, 
where she is on a ventilator because of her punctured lung. She could be
 in hospital for several months.

Falll: She is on a life support machine in a Spanish hospital following the accident at around 2am on Sunday

Ms Duffy said: 'People will say "why wasn't she insured? It was her own fault." The fact of the matter is she wasn't insured, she wasn't drinking, it was just an awful accident.

'Any parent would be devastated if it happened to their child. We have got to raise some money to get Amy home and to get the operations she needs.

'Her mum is in Malaga with her. We think she can actually get some money back with the European health card but there will be a massive shortfall.

Fundraising effort: Ms Wigfull has no holiday insurance and her family are trying to raise 20,000 euros to fly her back to her home in Sheffield

'Apparantly Spanish citizens don't get the rights we get on the NHS, they get about 70 or 80 per cent of the costs but there will still be a huge shortfall. We have no idea what the final bill will be.

'We are not thinking about that, we just want her to get better and back home but its going to be a long period of recovery. Because she has punctured her lung she is still on a ventilator.

'As soon as she is fit to have the operations they will assess it from there. Doctors have said it could be four weeks but it could be four months, we just don't know.

'A friend has started a giving page on Facebook. We are absolutely overwhelmed by friends and people who don't even know her giving money, it's already up to £3,500.

'They are obviously aware that Amy should have had insurance but they just want to help, we are hoping that money will go towards the shortfall.

'We were insured but for whatever reason Amy wasn't but she might have thought she didn't need it because it was a short break but we all know you do.'

She added: 'We weren't on a holiday where we were going on jet skis or hiring motorbikes where you hear most of the fatalities are abroad. It was a family get together and it ended up like this.'

Ms Wilgfull, whose boyfriend Andy is flying out to be at her bedside, is believed to need at least four operations, at a cost of 10,000 euros each.

She is being treated as Spanish citizen in the Universitario Virgen De La Victoria Hospital in Malaga.

Because of this, she will have to find up to 30 per cent of the price - and she then faces the cost of an air ambulance back to the UK.

Family and friends are also raising money for living costs so that her mother can stay with her.

A
 British Consulate official in Malaga said last night that she should 
not have to pay for her care, adding: ‘If there are problems, she should
 contact us.’
