With the World Cup approaching, football fans from around the globe are looking for the perfect place to watch the action.

And just in time, London-based manufacturer Titan has launched the world's largest television to view all the goals in high definition.

Named Zeus, the television is eight metres by five metres, or 370 inches, which is around the size of a football goal - and it could be yours for £1 million ($1.7 million).

The TV is eight metres by five metres, or 370 inches, which is around the size of a football goal.

It costs £1 million ($1.7 million). 

Football fans can watch the World Cup with players at actual size and in 4K - the equivalent of double high definition. 

It features 65 billion colours, weighs almost a tonne and can be controlled via gestures, with users able to change the channel with a simple wink.

The huge screen can work in 'panel format' allowing viewers to watch up to 20 channels at any one time at the same time.

It is also the only screen in the world that dynamically reacts to the light in the room 

The device is significantly larger than the previous largest existing TV in the world, a 152-inch 4k set made by Japanese manufacturer, Panasonic.

This means football fans can watch the World Cup with players at actual size and in 4K - the equivalent of double high definition.

It features 65 billion colours, weighs almost a tonne and can be controlled via gestures, with users able to change the channel with a simple wink.

The TV additionally comes pre-built with a dynamic CGI aquarium turning into a giant fish tank, which uses motion tracking technology and is touch sensitive

It is also the only screen in the world that dynamically reacts to the light in the room to adjust the brightness and colour quality in real-time.

Only four Zeus screens will be made, and the first two having already been pre-sold to a British media millionaire and to a hotel on the seafront in Cannes. 

The one sold to the unnamed British millionaire is thought to be installed at the bottom of their swimming pool. 

Zeus is the only screen in the world that dynamically reacts to the light in the room, or in its environment, adjusting brightness and colour quality in real-time 

Anthony Ganjou, chief executive of Titan said: ‘We have assembled the best screen technologists in the country to hand build a British-made screen which would not only be the biggest but the most extraordinary ever conceived.

‘Following the interest in the launch range of our ultra-high end 173 inch domestic screens we decided to create something iconic and the team spent six months building the million pound screen.’

The final two can be bought through the website. But if £1 million is too much, Titan said it also ‘creates bespoke screens aimed at the mid-range market, selling TVs for £150,000 ($250,000).’
