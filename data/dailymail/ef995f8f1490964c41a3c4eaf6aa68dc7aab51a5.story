A man was left with three of his best friend's teeth embedded in his knee after a bizarre accident on a trampoline.

Daniel Rigby, 29, from Pollards Hill, London, was lying on his trampoline playing with an iPad when Peter Walsh jumped up to join him.

The pair began play-fighting, but Mr Walsh suddenly crash-landed onto Mr Rigby's leg and was knocked unconscious.

Mr Rigby saw his friend's face pouring with blood and noticed some of his teeth were missing.

Then, when he looked down, he realised his friend's missing teeth had been planted into his own flesh.

But medics manage to leave the teeth lurking in Mr Rigby's knee when they sewed up the gaping wound.

Mr Rigby said: 'He jumped on and jokingly tried to kick me. I pulled his leg away and his face smashed into my knee and he blacked out.

'He was probably out for a couple of minutes. He was face down and I saw blood coming out of his mouth and teeth missing so I thought it was quite bad.

'I tried to stand up and then collapsed because of my leg.'

After Mr Walsh came around, Mr Rigby managed to call a taxi and drag the pair to the Accident and Emergency department at Croydon University Hospital. 

But he said medics failed to fully remove the teeth, causing a severe infection.

Worried the wound had not been properly cleaned, Mr Rigby went to the A & E department at St George's Hospital, Tooting, the next day, where doctors removed the remnants of his friend's teeth. 

He said: 'When I got to hospital, the doctor took me into a cubicle and I said to him: "there's still teeth in my leg".

'He took me off to X-Ray and he said there's only a bit of bone cartilage, nothing to worry about.

'They gave me two stitches and sent me on my way.'  

The 29-year-old says he is still suffering knee swelling following the incident in March. He is now suing Croydon University Hospital for allegedly failing to remove the teeth.

Mr Rigby, who works in scaffolding, has employed a solicitor to file a negligence claim against the hospital for failing to spot that parts of the teeth remained in his leg. 

He added: 'It's really bad. Since it happened my legs stiffens up and I have to strap it up when it gets really bad.

'I'm very grateful for the treatment I got at St George's but not to the man who treated me at Croydon.' 

A Croydon Health Services NHS Trust spokesman said: 'We cannot comment in detail on individual cases due to patient confidentiality.

'Patients in our care are advised to contact us again after treatment if their condition persists or worsens. We would encourage Mr Rigby to contact us if he has any concerns about his care.'
