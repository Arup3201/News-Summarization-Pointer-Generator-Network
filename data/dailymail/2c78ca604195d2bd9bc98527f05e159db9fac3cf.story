In their bright traditional dress, they couldn't have looked more different to Prince Charles in his conservative grey suit.

The African dance troupe - resplendent in vivid red and orange skirts, leopard print vests and with animal fur tied around their shins and arms - grinned as they met the Prince of Wales during a Buckingham Palace garden party yesterday.

The 65-year-old heir to the throne thanked the dancers for their performance - at an event marking the work of the Red Cross over the past 150 years and, especially, its efforts 100 years ago during the First World War.

Earlier Charles had joked with a group of women dressed in vintage nurses' uniforms - all modern day volunteers with the humanitarian organisation - who had joined hundreds of guests at the garden party.

Soaking up the glorious sunshine, Charles spoke to supporters, volunteers, and full-time staff in his capacity as president of the British Red Cross Society.

One volunteer Paloma Rossetti, 23, originally from Aix en Provence in southern France has been working at the Red Cross head office in central London and praised the organisation.

She said: 'I wanted to work in the charity sector. I studied political science and focused on international organisations and studied the humanitarian movement.

'For me the Red Cross is not just another organisation it's the one that shaped the humanitarian movement.'

Garden party guests are usually served a selection of sweet treats but yesterday they were given an unusual delicacy in the form of a cake made from a First World War recipe.

Staff from the royal kitchens made a fruit cake from a recipe given to the Red Cross by a Mrs J Laing of Herefordshire in 1988.

It was created by her great aunt Mary, who was a Voluntary Aid Detachment stationed at Badminton House, Gloucestershire for most of the Great War. She made the cake and gave slices, with a cup of tea, to soldiers on the troop trains.

Guests were entertained by military bands and dancers and singers from the organisation Zulu-Tradition, from the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.

The British Red Cross has an integrated HIV and TB project based in Kwazulu-Natal, working with communities to fight the epidemic and provide support to those living with the viruses.

The Duke of Cambridge took the salute at a spectacular tribute to Britain's armed forces yesterday.

The annual Beating Retreat display of military pomp and ceremony took on a special resonance this year, marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day and the centennial of the start of the First World War.

Servicemen and women marked the sacrifices of their forebears by impressing the 6,500-strong crowd with a display of horsemanship, pageantry and gunfire last night.

Adorned in the black and gold trimmed uniform of the Irish Guards, of which he is a Royal Colonel, Prince William opened the ceremony by taking the salute.

A procession of military musicians, each in the signature uniform of their battalion, performed a series of war-time anthems at the Horse Guards in Whitehall, central London.

The crowd saved one of their biggest cheers of the night for D-Day veteran Gordon Newton, who was shown on the big screen in the front row wearing his red beret and his medal adorning his chest.

He sang along as The Band of the Welsh Guards led a rendition of the First World War ballad 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary'. Asked what he thought of the display, he said simply: 'Wonderful.'

Paying tribute to Britain's armed forces, Prince William said: 'As Colonel of the Irish Guards I am delighted to support the Household Division Beating Retreat.

'Year after year this wonderful event showcases the skill and professionalism of our military musicians whilst reinforcing the traditions and heritage for which we as a nation are justifiably proud and envied the world over.'
