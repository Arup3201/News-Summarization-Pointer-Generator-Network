An 18-year-old Temple University student has died after plummeting from an eight-floor dorm room while taking pictures with her cell phone.

Pre-pharmacy student Rebecca Kim from Edison, New Jersey, was visiting friends at the Art Institute of Philadelphia in Center City on Thursday evening when she is believed to have slipped and fell.

Authorities say the first year, who graduated from Wissahickon High in Ambler, Pennsylvania, in August, may have been sitting on a two-foot wide ledge in the moments leading up to the deadly fall.

As she plummeted towards the sidewalk, the teen hit a 44-year-old pedestrian walking below at the time, breaking her back and knocking out her teeth.

'She may have even been sitting on the ledge, it's about a two foot wide ledge possibly taking some pictures,' Philadelphia Chief Inspector Scott Small told CBS Philadelphia.

The teen was pronounced dead upon her arrival at Jefferson University Hospital.

The other victim was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital, where she was listed in stable condition Thursday night.

'The 44-year-old female, she was conscious, she was talking, she was very upset and she was complaining of pain,' Small said.

The pedestrian suffered a fractured vertebrae and had some teeth knocked out, but was expected to recover.

Authorities say the teenager was visiting friends at the Art Institute dorm prior to the tragedy.

Police said they would obtain a warrant to search the dorm room of the two men the teen was visiting.

Neither foul play nor suicide were suspected, though officials said the investigation was ongoing. 

Temple University president Neil D. Theobold said: 'It is with great sadness that I inform you of the death of Rebecca Kim, a first-year student in the College of Science and Technology.
