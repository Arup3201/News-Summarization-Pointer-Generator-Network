Scam: Jamie Winter outside Hull Crown Court, where she pleaded guilty to five charges of fraud after administering botox when lying about her qualifications

A beautician was sentenced to 150 hours’ community work yesterday for lying to Botox clients that she qualified at Harley Street.

Customers thought they were getting a bargain price at £90 a session but in reality Jamie Winter was using cheap Botox that she had bought on the internet.

To reassure some she showed them a certificate which they believed proved her credentials.

Hull Crown Court heard the cosmetic fillers industry is still unregulated and Winter was not breaking the law by giving the injections – her offence was fraud for misleading her clients that she was qualified to do so.

She was exposed when one woman, who complained of a bad reaction, went to police. An assault charge relating to this client was dropped as it could not be proved the Botox caused her swelling.

Winter, 35, pleaded guilty to five fraud offences relating to treating ten women and two men in the Scarborough area over 18 months, for which she was paid £1,000 in total. Judge Simon Jack said she would have faced prison had she caused her clients damage.

Assault charges, relating to the woman who suffered swelling around her eyes after injections, were dropped because the Crown ‘couldn’t prove’ the reaction was caused by the Botox treatment.

Outside court she said she got the Botox through a supplier in the US and had done some training ‘online’.

‘It’s not a regulated industry,’ she said. ‘I would never have done the treatment if it was illegal.’

She said she is currently working as a beautician doing eyebrow treatments.

Judge Simon Jack told her she would have been facing prison had her work caused damage to her clients, who she visited at their homes in the Scarborough area. He said the potential consequences of her actions were ‘serious’.

He added: ‘Having Botox injected into you is something most people would want done by a qualified and experienced practitioner.’

The charges she admitted to involved payments for the anti-wrinkle treatments totalling around £1,000.

Her clients ran up bills ranging from £180 to £360 and word spread around the locality about the cut-price service she was offering.

Richard Thompson, defending, told the court the case involved an industry that was ‘not regulated at all’. He said Winter gained experience by carrying out treatments on herself and then on friends.

‘She provided a service at a lower price than one would ordinarily expect to pay but people were not told the truth about her experience,’ he added.

Publicity surrounding the case forced her to move away from Scarborough, the court heard.

Previously just a celebrity luxury, there has been a surge in the rise in popularity of Botox, with the most recently available statistics showing there were 370,000 Botox injections administered in 2010.

But this has also led to a rise in patients suffering from disfiguring side effects.

Earlier this year, the EU published a draft guideline advising that injections should be carried out by doctors, dentists and prescribing nurses in designated treatment rooms in a bid to cut down on cowboy practices.
