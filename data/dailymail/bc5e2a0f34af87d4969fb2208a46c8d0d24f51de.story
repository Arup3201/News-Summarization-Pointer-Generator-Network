Andres Iniesta talks from a position of authority when he discusses the World Cup. He is, after all, a member of an exclusive club — those who know how it feels to score in the final.

Only 56 players have scored in a World Cup final and Iniesta belongs to the elite collection who know the elation of scoring the winner.

He is admirably modest for someone who has seen, done and won so much. But his shy eyes sparkle when asked to recount the proudest moment of his glittering career four years ago, a glimpse of beauty in an otherwise ugly final with Holland at Soccer City in Johannesburg.

Same please! Andres Iniesta believes Spain can repeat their 2010 triumph by winning the World Cup again

‘It was the best thing that’s ever happened to me,’ Iniesta recalls. ‘Not only for me on a personal level but also for the Spanish team. 

‘There are not many other moments in life when you can feel any more overjoyed than that.’

Only two of the Dutch outfield players were not booked by English referee Howard Webb, with playmaker Iniesta seemingly the No 1 target in their brutal masterplan. 

Holland’s strategy of aggressive containment worked for 116 minutes. Then, with penalties looming, Cesc Fabregas released Iniesta inside the box. A touch with his outstretched right boot sent it invitingly forward at the perfect height to smash into the far corner.

‘When I scored, what was in my mind was that there wasn’t a lot of time left and I just really wanted the referee to blow the whistle!’

But if the goal was the mark of Iniesta as a player, his celebration was the measure of him as a man.  After checking for an offside flag, Iniesta whipped off his shirt to reveal a hand-scribbled message dedicated to his Spain youth teammate Dani Jarque, who had died of a heart attack 11 months earlier.

A few seconds of reflection in the ultimate moment of glory. The World Cup triumph in South Africa is the highest of Spanish football’s three peaks — they also won back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012 — and Iniesta has scaled them all. 

in all three, he was named in the Team of the Tournament. In 2010 and 2012, he was chosen Man of the Match in the final. 

It is an unprecedented spell of domination but surely it cannot continue in Brazil this summer? 

‘We hope it will,’ Iniesta says. ‘We have managed an unprecedented feat but there are always challenges. This is going to be a new, big challenge going to Brazil in the position of defending champions.’

The core of Vicente del Bosque’s side, featuring Iniesta’s Barcelona teammates Xavi, Fabregas and Sergio Busquets, plus Xabi Alonso of Real Madrid, remains intact while exciting new additions such as Atletico Madrid’s Koke prove the talent pool hasn’t dried up.

But faced with the vibrancy and fluidity of hosts Brazil in the Confederations Cup final last summer, Spain were starved of possession, off the pace and jaded, losing 3-0. 

That was only the third defeat suffered by Del Bosque in competitive matches since he took the reins nearly six years ago and Iniesta does not believe their dominance is about to end soon.

‘I don’t believe we are hugely  different from last time,’ he says. ‘We’ve had our moments but we have to keep in mind that Spain has one World Cup and Brazil has five.’

Spain have been paired with  Holland, Chile and Australia in an awkward looking Group B, rivalling England’s tricky assignment as the ‘Group of Death’.

‘I think they will all bring different styles but ultimately football is a leveller,’ he predicts. ‘They are all difficult but we are confident we can get out of the group.’

Do you believe? England should always be considered among the favourites to win, claims Andres Iniesta

England could find themselves on a collision course with the defending champions at the quarter-final stage and Iniesta is characteristically diplomatic on the chances of Roy Hodgson’s team.

‘England has always got to be a candidate, it has always got to be considered one of the favourites because of the history, because of the players, because they have a particularly defined style,’ he says.

‘They’ve got really good players, talented players, but apart from that what will really drive them is the desire to improve on the performance they had in 2010.’

Iniesta and Spain, of course, can’t improve on 2010. But they would settle for more of the same.
