The daughter of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has come under fire for an article in which she branded the poor city of Flint, Michigan 'apocalyptic' - and used a photo of Israel as proof.

Laura Dimon, 26, from New York, penned the piece for PolicyMic and detailed the town's crime and unemployment stats, sweeping over the number of residents her father's bank foreclosed on.

'Flint now drowns in the hell that has become much of America's Rust Belt,' Dimon wrote of Flint, which was the birthplace of General Motors.

But after the article - 'This is America's Most Apocalyptic, Violent City - And You've Probably Never Heard Of It' - was published, it emerged that some of the photos of Flint were actually of other places.

Under fire: Laura Dimon, the daughter of beleaguered JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, has written an article about Flint, Michigan that has sparked anger for its focus and inaccuracies

A Reddit thread hitting back at the article first pointed out that the pictures were not all accurate.

'I thought I was hallucinating at first, but this picture is not actually from Flint,' one user wrote, the Raw Story reported. 'I know this because I lived in the place pictured almost my entire life.

'It's a city in Israel called Ramla. I'm really confused as to why this picture is featured in the article and I'm a little creeped out.'

A Google street map view shows that the photograph in the article matches the street in Ramla. Another photograph that actually pictured Detroit was also removed amid the backlash.

As Dimon was criticized, she admitted that she has never been to Flint.

After the photos were taken down, the website added an explanation that the article had also been re-headlined to: 'This is one of America's most violent cities - and it deserves more attention'.

'We believe the correction better befits the intent of our writer,' the editors wrote, 'and we continue to stand by the story.'

Deadline Detroit noted that PolicyMic is similar to websites like Buzzfeed that use a 'a behavioral analyst' to generate viral headlines before assigning them to a writer to produce a matching story.

'That cart-before-horse reversal - "do a clip job on Flint as America's most apocalyptic, violent city" - is not how things typically work at new media or those with print roots,' writer Alan Stamm wrote.

'But while traditional editorial practices may point the way to an ethical high road, they're not necessarily the route to a high-traffic path in journalism's reshaped landscape.'

Corrections: The editors also changed the name of the article - after realizing Flint was in fact a well known place

Redditors also attacked Dimon's assumption that Flint - the home of General Motors and a feature of documentaries by Michael Moore, who grew up there - was unknown.

And after being slammed for her article, Dimon gave a surprising reaction on her Twitter account.

'Flint
 Fights Back piece is in serious consideration,' she wrote. 'Wow, what a vocal and 
proud city. Pride well-earned. Thanks to all for the responses.'

It is not the first time Dimon, a Barnard and Columbia graduate, has come under fire this month - after she, her siblings and parents sent out a Christmas card featuring them hitting tennis balls around their luxurious home.

Jamie Dimon, 57, was branded 'tone deaf' after sending the decadent card to employees at JPMorgan.

Critics said that the card was tasteless in a time of economic hardship as Dimon earns $18.7m a year, making him one of the best compensated bosses in America.

MSNBC host Chris Hayes said it was as if
 the Dimon family were saying: ‘Hey, we’re so rich we can destroy our 
own stuff’, whilst The Atlantic magazine said it was ‘braggy and 
opulent’.

In October JPMorgan agreed a $13billion deal with the US government to end investigations into its selling of mortgage investments in the 2008 financial crisis.
