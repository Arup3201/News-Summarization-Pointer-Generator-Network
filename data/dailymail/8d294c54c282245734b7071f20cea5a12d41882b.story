Lawsuit: Zia Ziprin, 51, who formerly owned the Lower East Side footwear boutique Girls Love Shoes and her daughter Aishling Labat, 23, say a peeping Tom filmed them near-naked in a change room

A Manhattan mother and daughter are suing H&M, claiming a peeping Tom filmed them as they tried on lingerie in one of the clothing giant's flimsy dressing rooms.

Zia Ziprin, 51, who formerly owned the Lower East Side footwear boutique Girls Love Shoes and her daughter Aishling Labat, 23, said the incident took place while they were shopping at H&M's Fifth Avenue store near the Flatiron in January 2010.Â 

The women claim they were 'in a state of undress within the dressing room stall' on the second floor when the unidentified man in an adjoining stall pulled out a 'camera or video camera' and filmed them, according to the lawsuit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.

Labat noticed the man as she was changing into the underwear, her attorney, Ross Rothenberg, told The New York Post.

'She saw there was something above the dressing room. She thought it was a security camera, but when she reached up there was nothing there,' Rothenberg said.

'She started screaming and he ran from the second story down to the first' and escaped.

'Their assumption is that somewhere on the Internet is videos of both of them' changing into the negligee, Rothenberg said.

He said, however, the women haven't yet been able to track down the footage.

Both Ziprin and Labat 'pleaded with H&M's security and store personnel to stop (the man) from leaving the store ...with the compromising video and photographs,' the suit alleges.

It says Ziprin 'begged for help from security and/or store personnel, who ignored her request.'

Rothenberg told The Post that police obtained security footage of the suspect and investigated the incident but never caught him.

The women say they have suffered 'embarrassment, humiliation, fear, panic, torment' and want unspecified damages to make up for it.

The suit claims the store's flimsy, unisex dressing rooms allow easy access to eavesdroppers and would-be perverts.

An H&M spokesman told The Post that the company hasn't seen the suit but said its policy was to refuse comment on such matters anyway.
