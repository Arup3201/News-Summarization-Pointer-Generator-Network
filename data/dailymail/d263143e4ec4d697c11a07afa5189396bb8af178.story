This amusing video shows a group of Canadian pranksters following customers by dressing up and posing as real Apple Store employees.

Introducing themselves at the start of the video, the four men from Toronto explain that they intend to 'quit' their jobs as pretend workers at the computer company.

Kyle Forgeard, 20, Jesse Sebastiani, 21, Niko Martinovic, 25 and Marko Martinovic, also 25, are shown speaking to shoppers and giving them advice on the products they are looking to buy.

Jesse appears on screen first, where he is approached by a man enquiring about purchasing a new iPhone.

After a short discussion, in which the prankster does his best to be as unhelpful as possible, the man turns to leave the shop empty handed.

Next to feature in the video is Kyle who is asked a rather technical question regarding an iPad Air.

After a little conversation, in which the prankster again chooses to ignore the question, a real employee approaches and asks for the imposter’s name.

He says: ‘Sorry, do you even work here,’ before adding: ‘I have never seen you before.’

A little discussion ensues, which involves the real employee appearing to call for a manager, until the prankster announces to the room: ‘You know what? Nobody even knows who I am here. I have been here three shifts, I quit.’

Later in the video another prankster is caught talking to a customer and is again approached by a real employee.

Interrupting him mid-flow, the man announces to the customer: ‘He doesn’t actually work here,’ to which the prankster retorts that he has done so for the last three months.

Eventually he leaves in the same animated way as the previous imposter, with a fellow prankster making his way out of the shop with him.

The video concludes with a prankster talking to a customer about how he thinks he should quit his job before again announcing to the room his intentions and leaving the shop.

A number of customers look around and laugh as the two men make their dramatic exits. 

The four men are known for recording a number of prank videos, which they upload to their YouTube channel NelkFilmz.

The last video they filmed, entitled ‘Coke Prank on Cops’, involved the foursome insinuating that they had cocaine to sell.

Instead, as the police later discovered after stopping them, the men were actually transporting cans of Coca-Cola.

The clip received criticism at the time, with the LAPD telling NBC News that the prank was irresponsible.

Commander Andrew Smith of the LAPD said: 'It is dangerous for the participants involved and a huge waste of a police officer's time.'

'The public has a right to have their police officers working and not wasting their time responding to juvenile pranks.'
