FDNY Battalion Chief Paul Tague told WABC New York the ferry captain saw the woman jump.

She was carried by the tide about three blocks south of the dock, the paper reported. 

Officials at the scene said the water temperature was so cold that it would kill a person after about four minutes.

The woman was believed to have been in the water for about 20 minutes. 

The NYPD, FDNY, and Coast Guard all responded to the area near Brooklyn Bridge.

Divers in protective gear entered the water.

The rescue effort took longer than usual because of the amount of floating ice in the East River from the Arctic blast, police said.

The woman was pulled out in an extremely critical condition.

Medics at the scene administered CPR as they rushed her to Woodhull Hospital.

She was pronounced dead in hospital.

A diver that went into the water was also taken to hospital, but is fine.

Frozen: Officials said the temperature of New York's East River is so freezing, it would kill you in less than four minutes. The woman was believed to have been in the water for 20 minutes before being pulled out

The woman's name has not been released, pending notification of next of kin.

Earlier Friday a man's body was also pulled from the East River.

The body was found near Murray Hills and police said it was badly decomposed.

The man was wearing black pants and had no identification on him, according to The New York Post.

Police are trying to establish whether there was foul play involved or if the death was accidental.

February has officially been the coldest month in New York for 81 years. 

The average temperature in the Big Apple over the last four weeks has been 24F - 11 degrees below normal. 

New York joins other metropolitan areas such as Chicago and Pittsburgh, which have also experienced their most frigid February in decades. 

Duties continue: The tug Arabian Sea pushes a barge through the icy waters of the Hudson River on Friday, near Rhinecliff, in Upstate New York. With the prolonged cold winter weather, the Coast Guard has been busy clearing shipping lanes
