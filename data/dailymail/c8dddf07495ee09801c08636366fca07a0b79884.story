The Australian man who drowned at the weekend off a luxurious resort in Fiji has been identified as 37-year-old Melbourne tourist Benjamin John Busbridge.

A Fijian police source told MailOnline Mr Busbridge died of 'asphyxiation due to drowning' and that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the man's death.

He added that the investigation into the drowning had concluded.

Trouble in paradise: Benjamin John Busbridge, 37, drowned on Saturday night while snorkeling near the Outrigger on the Lagoon resort in Fiji

It is believed Mr Busbridge drowned on Saturday night after venturing out for a lone snorkeling trip near the Outrigger on the Lagoon resort in Fiji's Viti Levu island.

He was last seen walking along the beach on Saturday afternoon. The alarm was raised when he failed to return his snorkeling gear to the resort that night.

His body washed up on a coral reef about 1.5km from the resort at 9.50am on Sunday.

The resort's general manager Peter Hopgood told MailOnline Mr Busbridge had been staying with a female guest - named by police as Melbourne-based Taiwanese national Hsu Yen ChunÂ  - and that she had since checked out.

Mystery drowning: How Mr Busbridge drowned remained unclear. He had only booked one night's accommodation at the Outrigger resort

He said he was waiting on the coroner's report before making further comment.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware of the incident and was working with local consular officials to have the man's body returned to Australia.

The Outrigger on the Lagoon resort offers some of Fiji's finest and most exclusive accommodation, with weekend rooms starting at $240 per night.

Mr Busbridge and his female acquaintance had only booked one night at the resort - a popular destination for Australian tourists roughly 80km from Nadi.

His death comes just days after Sydney father-of-three Mark Hardaker died in a collision between two boats while holidaying with his family in Fiji on May 15.
