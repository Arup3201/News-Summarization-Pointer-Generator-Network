The Voice contestant Lisbeth Gonzalez Ruiz, 18, became the fourth victim of the Mexican show's curse after she was killed in a car crash

The Mexican version of The Voice is feared to be cursed after the show was rocked by a fourth death.

Talented female singer Lizbeth Gonzalez Ruiz, who appeared as a contestant on the current series, was killed in a car crash.

The 18-year-old was on her way to a performance with her twin sister Lizeth when their father lost control of his car and it overturned.

Moments before the accident, the teen tweeted followers: 'I have never taken the highway at 3am #TengoMiedo' which translates into I'm afraid'. 

Friends of the teenager, who along with her sister had been signed to perform across Mexico after appearing on the show, said that she was aware of the curse and was fearful of it.

The family was travelling between  Guaymas and Hermosillo, in the north-western Mexican state of Sonora, when the accident happened.

Lizbeth's mother, father, sister and cousin, were all understood to have escaped without serious injury.

The first victim of the 'curse' was the singer and judge Jenni Rivera, who was named 'La Diva of the band' among Mexican public.

She died in a plane crash in 2012  on her way to the capital Mexico City to record a duet with her partner Paulina Rubio.

She was 43-years-old and had five children.

Lizbeth and her twin sister Lizeth appeared as a duo on season four of the hit television series

In season two presenter Jacqueline Bracamontes, 35, suffered the death of one of her twin babies, a boy, due to respiratory problems.

And the rumours that the show was cursed started when tragedy struck again in season three, when contestant Gibran David Martiz, 22, who was in the team of music duo Wisin and Yandel, was found dead with one of his friends inside a car after a horrific crash.

He had been missing for 12 days before his body was found in the wreckage in the state of Veracruz, in the Huatusco-Rabbits road.

Lizbeth Gonzalez Ruis was said to be nervous about the curse that was said to hang over the Mexican version of the show

After appearing on the show the siblings were signed up to tour Mexico and were on their way to a performance when tragedy struck
