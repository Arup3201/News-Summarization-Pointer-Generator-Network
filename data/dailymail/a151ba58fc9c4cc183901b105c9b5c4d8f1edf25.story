The sister of one of the terrorists behind the heinous Paris attacks has been found the be the creator of a type of dance therapy based on twerking.

Amedy Coulibaly, 32, killed four hostages at a Paris kosher supermarket the day after shooting a policewoman dead in the street last week.

His sister Maimouna, 39, is a well-known choreographer who has appeared on French TV and runs empowering 'Booty Therapy' classes worldwide.

Worlds apart: Maimouna Couilbaly, sister of Paris jihadist Amedy Coulibaly, is a choreographer who runs 'Booty Therapy' classes and has made several appearances on French TV

Maimouna Couilbaly has appeared several times on shows such as France's Got Talent (La France a un Incroyable Talent) and runs a dance company with classes in popular Afro-urban dance styles.

She is the creator of 'Booty Therapy', a dance class set to 'liberate' and empower women, and can be seen surrounded by exhilarated twerking students in several YouTube videos. 

Maimouna holds classes in France and the U.S. and a 'Booty Therapy' course of 20 lessons costs £230 (300 euro).

The 39-year-old is best known for her dance show which set out to highlight culture clashes and everyday racism faced by young immigrants in France.

The play, Hééé Mariamou, is based on Maimouna's experience growing up on a council estate, a 'cite', in Grigny, an impoverished suburb of Paris, as the daughter of Mali immigrants.

Condemnation: After the attacks by her jihadist brother Amedy, pictured, Maimouna and her mother released a statement condeming his actions and offering their 'sincere condolences' to the families of those killed

'I always felt misunderstood in my youth. I did not know where my place in society, at home, at school,' Ms Coulibali writes on her website

She writes that she drew on 'all my frustrations, insults suffered in my youth, racism, prejudice... Towards my mother and myself.

'To hear all the c*** said on TV or in the newspapers about the estates,the way they judge without knowing, I wanted to express myself, give my point of view.

Since its first run in 1999, Hééé Mariamou has been staged in Paris and San Francisco 

Shortly after police released the name of the man responsible for the terrorist attack on the kosher deli in Paris, Amedy Coulibaly's family condemned his actions  and offered their 'sincere condolences' to the families of those killed.

'We condemn these acts,' Mariamou and her mother said in a statement.

'We absolutely do not share these extreme ideas. We hope there will not be any confusion between these odious acts and the Muslim religion.'
