Married Catholic couples who attend church at least once a week have better sex than other demographics, according to the Family Research Council.

The Council, which is a socially conservative Christian group, presented its findings in a talk entitled  'Porn in the Dorm: The Impact of Pornography on College Campus Life' at the Center for the Advancement of Catholic Higher Education Wednesday in Washington DC.

The revelation was heavily based upon a 1992 University of Chicago study, the National Health and Social Life Survey, as well as other data.

Wedded bliss: A Christian group says that Catholic married couples have more frequent and fulfilling sex

The 21-year-old study actually found that the most enjoyable and most frequent sex occurring among married people was between those who attended church weekly (any church, not only Catholic) and people who had the least sexual partners.

'Those who worship God weekly have the best sex,' said Patrick Fagan, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council and a former George H.W. Bush official at the event.

'I want to see this on the cover of Playboy sometime.'

US News reports that an audience member 
asked Fagan whether it's dangerous to be guaranteeing Catholics great 
sex if they abstain until marriage.

Guilt-free: According to recent studies, Catholics feel a distinct lack of guilt about having sex before marriage

Fagan replied that married Catholic couples will have the best sex of their lives - because it's the only sex they'll ever know.

Or is it?

According to a recent YouGov study, when British Catholics were polled on whether they would feel guilty about four different sexual activities - premarital sex, extramarital sex, using pornography and using contraception - only 14 per cent of the Catholic respondents said they would.

This compares to 16 per cent of all religious people (of any faith) and three per cent of non-religious people, according to the survey, which was commissioned for the 2013 series of the Westminster Faith Debates.

Big family: Despite the Catholic Church's teaching 12 per cent of Catholics would not feel guilty about using contraception

Catholics have long touted their sexual superiority, and due to the Pope's stance on contraception, they've got the families to prove it. 

However, the YouGov study found that only 12 per cent of practising Catholics would feel guilty about using contraception.

Sex and religion: Catholics are feeling less guilty about perceived 'sins' surronding sex than ever before

An Amazon search on the subject of Catholic sex search brings up 2,552 results (however, many among them are about Catholic church sex abuse scandals), among them Holy Sex!: A Catholic Guide to Toe-Curling, Mind-Blowing, Infallible Loving by Gregory K. Popcak PhD, Sex: The Catholic Experience by priest Andrew Greeley and The Catholic Girl's Guide to Sex by Kathleen Murray.

Greeley's book, written in 1994, also contains some interesting statistics about the sex lives of Catholics.

According to Greeley, despite the Church's teachings, 80 per cent of devout Catholic women approve of sex for pleasure alone. Nine out of 10 don't think contraception is wrong and 66 per cent of single Catholics have sex, compared to 57 per cent of Protestants.

These figures don't quite support the conservative Family Research Council viewpoint.

The Council cautioned its Christian audience on Wednesday that some of the side effects of sexual deviance, such as watching pornography, include poverty, domestic abuse, crime, drug addiction and losing your job. 

The US News reports that Fagan invoked some ancient history to support his case against couples using pornography: 'What we have here is a pagan sexuality. Homosexuality, infidelity, euthanasia, infanticide - these were all common sexual practices of pagan Rome. Christians were for being very different, for being monogamous, faithful.'

The Family Research Council, which lobbies against LGBT rights, abortion, divorce, embryonic stem-cell research and pornography, was classified as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2010.

Fagan told the audience members that the group is trying to gather more recent data on religious sexual enjoyment.
