Fleeing France: Musician Jean-Michel Jarre may move his business to London's new 'Tech City' to escape France's looming tax hikes

French millionaire composer Jean-Michel Jarre is set to flee to London to escape France's looming socialist tax hikes on the rich.

The icon of electronic pop music may join a flood of well-heeled French moving to 'wealth-friendly' countries like Britain, Switzerland and Belgium.

The 64-year-old musician has met Downing Street officials to discuss relocating his business to London's new 'Tech City', a media and technology hub in east London.

His move will come after film star Gerard Depardieu and France's richest man Bernard Arnault both announced earlier this year that they were moving to Belgium - where taxes are significantly lower than France.

French optician shop tycoon Alain Afflelou, another of France's richest men, has also announced he is moving to Britain to expand his business empire.

A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron's office told France's AFP news agency: 'Jean-Michel Jarre visited Downing Street to meet with officials about Tech City, London's media and technology hub.

'There are a growing number of businesses and entrepreneurs from across the world who want to be part of the technology cluster in east London and we are keen for that to continue.'

Jarre is known for his spectacular concerts and hit seventies albums Oxygene and Equinoxe. He also owns Jarre Technologies, a company which makes products like the AeroPad One, a dock speaker for iPods, iPads and iPhones.

Mr Cameron angered the French in June when he said Britain would 'roll out the red carpet' to welcome more French businesses to the UK.

He told a business summit in Mexico: 'And they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and everything else.'

The exodus from France began after left-wing President Francois Hollande announced plans for new higher tax of 75 per cent on all earnings over one million euros (£850,000).

France's highest court last week ruled the tax was illegal because it targeted individual earnings and not the joint in come of a household.

But Mr Hollande has insisted he plans
to fight the court ruling and raise taxes on the rich to ensure 'those 
with the most pay the most'.

The
flight of France's rich also comes as Paris estate agents warned that 
France's luxury property market had hit a 'selling panic' as the 
super-rich rushed to move away.

Luxury property agent Daniel Feau said: 
'It's nearly a general panic out there with some 400 to 500 residences 
worth more than one million euros coming onto the Paris market since 
May.

'And the profile of those who are leaving has changed, from the idle rich to managers of major international corporations who are scared of a marginal tax rate of 62.21 percent on sales of stock.'

In London, recruitment agency Astbury Martin - which specialises in highly-paid banking jobs - said it had seen a 51 per cent in applications from French jobseekers.

The latest London estate agency figures have also shown large numbers of France's most well-heeled families selling up and moving to more 'wealth-friendly' nations like Britain and Switzerland.

British estate agent Sotherby's said this summer that its French offices sold more than 100 properties over 1.7 million euros between April and June this year - a marked increase on the same period in 2011.

Sotheby's French boss Alexander Kraft said: 'The result of the presidential election has had a real impact on our sales.

'Now a large number of wealthy French families are leaving the country as a direct result of the proposals of the new government.'
