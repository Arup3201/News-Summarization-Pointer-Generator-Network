It is the inspiration behind the world's most famous fictional girl's school.

But after 132 years of only allowing girls through its doors, the private school which inspired  St Trinian's will soon be opening to boys.

The Perse School for Girls in Cambridge, which inspired Ronald Searle's cartoons of delinquent girls in gym slips under an eccentric headmistress, is to break with tradition by teaching boys.

They will be able to join the junior school from September 2014 and the senior school, which opened in 1881, four years later.

The girls and boys aged nine to 16 will be taught separately in most subjects, but join together for the creative arts and sport and will be able to eat and socialise together.

Tricia Kelleher, principal of the Stephen Perse Foundation, a group of private schools in Cambridge which includes Perse Girls, said the 'time was right' to allow boys into the school.

She added: 'The girls' senior school will continue to offer outstanding opportunities for learning, but will enjoy mutual benefits from interaction in a range of social, cultural and sporting activities afforded by the creation of the new boys' section.

'We are very excited by the changes. 
We don't have any single sex private boys schools left in Cambridge 
anymore so we are returning that choice to parents.

'I think it will make us an even stronger school.'

Boys are already on the roll at the school's two pre-prep sites as well as the Stephen Perse Sixth Form College.

Ms Kelleher said they are reacting to demand from parents, as well as would-be pupils.

The late Ronald Searle, who died two years ago aged 91, was born and grew up in Cambridge and memories of its feisty school girls never left him.

As a teenager at the Boys' Central School in Cambridge he remembered seeing the Perse girls going home from school.

Searle published the first of his famous St Trinian's cartoons in the magazine Lilliput in 1941.

Shortly afterwards he had to fulfil his military service and was captured in Singapore and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese.

He started drawing new cartoons after the war in 1946 but the content was much darker.

They often showed school girls drinking, gambling and smoking and the school mistress was disreputable.

In the 1950s a series of St Trinian's comedy films were made and the characters were brought to a new generation of fans in 2007 in a film starring Lily Cole and Russell Brand.

In 1993 Searle wrote to the school librarian at the Perse School and revealed the Perse Girls pupils were part of his inspiration for the St Trinian's cartoons.

The letter said: 'As you know I was born in Cambridge and St Trinian's emerged from an amalgamation of local schoolgirls.

'My sister apart, I think we can say that the main influences were certainly the Perse and the Cambridge High School for Girls.

'The Perse School for Girls was a positive source of inspiration for St Trinian's but I hope the school won't hold that against me so many years after the crime.'

Ms Kelleher added: 'I'm very proud that the school was the inspiration for St Trinian's and my feeling is that the criminality aside, the girls were independent, individual and feisty.

'We want our girls to be like that and now we want to offer that to boys too.'
