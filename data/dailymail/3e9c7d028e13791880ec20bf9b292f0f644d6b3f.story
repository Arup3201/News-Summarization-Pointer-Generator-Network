Manchester United manager David Moyes is refusing to admit defeat in the race for Champions League qualification.

The manager has endured a turbulent first season in charge at Old Trafford, which could end in United missing out on European competition altogether.

They currently lie 11 points beneath Arsenal in fourth and face an almost impossible task of qualifying for the continent's premier competition.

That, however, doesn't deter Moyes, who goes into Tuesday's Manchester derby looking for a third victory on the spin after being humiliated by Liverpool.

He remains insistent - publicly at least - that they are able to bridge the gap.

'Until it is impossible for us to qualify for next season's Champions League with a top-four finish, we will continue to try and reach that goal,' Moyes wrote in his programme notes.

'Football is cyclical and it will not be long before we are on the up.

'At this present time we sit behind City in the Premier League table, but that is something we will be looking to rectify in the future.

'The title race is something we are aiming to be involved in over the coming campaigns, just as we have been in the past.'

Moyes has been backed by Sir Bobby Charlton ahead of the game, insisting that the former Everton man is 'right' for the job.

It comes on the same day as Fernandinho chose to taunt United revealing his surprise at how poor last season's champions were when the sides met in September.

Confident: Charlton says the club have no intention of changing the man at the top following bad results

Anxious? Moyes has always retained the support of the board through a turbulent first year in charge
