A Massachusetts hospital is under investigation after two women died giving birth to healthy children within a month of each other.

Maternal deaths in the United States are quite rare and happened just three times in the state last year.

Colleen Celia, 32, died last week during a planned Caesarian section at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth. She was preceded in death by Christie Fazio, 30, who died on December 14.

According to family, the two women were able to hold their children before passing away.

On Sunday, the hospital released a statement saying that their staff did all they could in attempting to save the women.

'It is too early to know the exact nature of the underlying factors that led to these tragic outcomes,' the statement read. 'All signs suggest that the two situations were unrelated, unanticipated and unpreventable.'

Hospitals are required to report maternal deaths and other serious injuries within seven days and file an additional follow-up report after 30 days.

Mrs Celia, a patient coordinator at Vanguard Medical, was already a mother of three children, ages 14, 9 and 6.

She had given birth to her other children vaginally but delivered daughter Mya Rose via c-section after her pregnancy was ruled high-risk.

High risk: 32-year-old Colleen Celia had previously given birth to three other children, but scheduled a Caesarian section at South Shore Hospital last week since her pregnancy was deemed 'high-risk'

Mother taken: Mrs Celia left behind four children including her newborn Mya. Her previous children range in age from 6 to 14

Doctors told her family that she died from an amniotic fluid embolism which happens when there is a blockage in the bloodstream.

Her husband Paul Celia, 31, was in the room as she slipped away.

'I wouldn’t leave her,' Mr Celia told the Boston Herald. 'They tried everything they could to save her.'

Mr Celia says he's not angry at the hospital, but he would like to make sure it doesn't happen again.

It was unclear whether Mrs Fazio underwent a c-section or vaginal birth. She was able to briefly hold her son Jonathan before doctors noticed she was bleeding and tried to save her.

Her husband John Fazio, 27, also spoke with the Herald and said he is dealing with her death by taking comfort that she is 'with the lord'. Mr Fazio also treasures the newborn son she left behind. 

'I definitely see Christie’s face in him,' Fazio said. 'I get strength from that smile.'

Mr Celia echoed the same sentiment, calling newborn daughter Mya a gift.

Hospital staff are also having a hard time dealing with the deaths.

Previous gifts: John Fazio says he takes comfort in his newborn son who has Christie's face. 'I get strength from that smile,' he said.

Spokesman Sarah Darcy told the Enterprise News that the maternity ward 'has been understandably devastated'.

'Their focus right now is on supporting these two families,' Ms Darcy said Sunday.

The Board of Registration in Medicine lists no discipline or malpractice decision against any obstetricians at the hospital. Maternal deaths happen just 650 times a year in the U.S.

Maternal deaths have been on the rise and are double what they were 25 years ago, but most of that is contributed to better reporting and environmental reasons.
