These simple black and white images carry a heavy message about the lack of self acceptance women often feel towards their bodies.

The project, entitled 'We.Women' shows people staring at their own reflection dressed only in their underwear.

The work of Lithuanian photographer Neringa Rekašiūtė, TV presenter Beata Tiškevič Hasanova and communications specialist Modesta Kairyte, the photos convey a complex issue with beautiful poignancy.

'We. Women' is a series of black and white photos of ladies facing themselves in the mirror 

Neringa didn't direct the women at all, capturing them taking their very first glance at themselves 

Although many of the women gaze proudly on themselves, others struggle with what they see 

'There is so much more to woman that her appearance!' Neringa says

Asking women to be brave and simply stand facing a full length mirror, they end up standing tall and proudly taking in their own reflection. 

Neringa says her goal in creating We.Women was to challenge the 'mass hypnosis' that the omni-present media portrayal of the 'perfect' women creates.

Speaking to the MailOnline, she explains: 'Beata, Modesta and I (the three creators of the project) were really unhappy about the situation in Lithuania concerning body image. 

'There are lots of stereotypes about how beautiful Lithuanian girls are and it is a heavy burden to carry around. 

'Yes, we are beautiful, but this unhealthy body cult is very damaging for a lot of young women in Lithuania. 

Neringa says her goal in creating We. Women was to challenge the 'mass hypnosis' that the omni-present media portrayal of the 'perfect' women creates

'We wanted to inspire women to accept and love their bodies as they are: with all the inner and outer scars. 

'And we believe that by doing so one can release a lot of energy and use it for what really matters: self - discovery. We saw a void in Lithuania, because there hadn't been any projects of this kind before. 

'As they stood in front of the mirror, I captured the first moment they glanced into it. I wanted it to be that unique moment. So I didn't direct them at all.'

Neringa says she wants the photos to: 'Inspire women to take off the burden of standardised beauty cult and achieve great things in life instead.

'There is so much more to woman that her appearance! I am wishing for a day we don't need to talk about it anymore.'

Women of all ages and sizes took part in the project which aims to challenge the way they see their bodies

Despite the simplicity of the photos, their complex message of self acceptance manages to shine through 

Neringa says that the stereotype of how beautiful Lithuanian girls are places a burden on her country women
