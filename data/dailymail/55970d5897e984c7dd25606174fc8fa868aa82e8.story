Alan Pardew joked with owner Mike Ashley about the ‘cheap telly’ which threatened to postpone the game, but they both knew that the subsequent victory had been priceless.

Ashley made his first visit to the home dressing-room in more than four years to congratulate his manager and players and, as he returned to the chairman’s suite, remarked: ‘That was a relief’.

Pardew, too, had used the word ‘relief’, as did every Newcastle player who emerged to speak to the press.

And there was relief on a bizarre afternoon at St James’ Park; relief that the club’s new giant screen which became dislodged before the match did not force its cancellation and instead delayed kick-off by an hour, relief at a first win of the Premier League season and relief at Gabriel Obertan’s first top-flight goal in more than two-and-a-half years.

Pardew, though, took even more satisfaction from the post-match appearance of his paymaster, further reinforcing the support he has shown during the team’s recent toil.

‘It was a surprise - we didn't expect to see him,’ said Pardew.

‘I teased him about the cheap telly and he took that in good spirits. We all had a bit of a laugh about it.

‘But he spent about 10 minutes congratulating everyone. If anyone has ever doubted his commitment you saw it there. He was as happy as any fan at the win.

‘That is the first time since I have been here that he has been in the dressing-room straight after the game. It shows what that result meant to him.

October 18 is the latest Newcastle fans have ever had to wait for a first Premier League victory of the season.

‘I hope the fans understand that we’re not as great as we should be, but a win will help us.’

The result, of course, meant Pardew avoided the ignominy of a club record eight without victory from the start of a Premier League season.

But that it was achieved thanks to forgotten Frenchman Gabriel Obertan – a player left behind when United travelled to New Zealand in pre-season – serves to highlight the depths Pardew has trawled to unearth a match-winner in his squad.

For while £12million Remy Cabella sat on the bench and £6m signings Emmanuel Riviere and Siem de Jong watched on injured, it was Obertan who passed his screen test on what was his first home start in more than 20 months, darting infield in the 71st minute before arrowing into the bottom corner from the edge of the area.

And Pardew said: ‘He’s all about self-confidence. When he believes in himself he’s unplayable. This will only boost his confidence.

‘He’s still young with such great potential and, if we can get that out of him every week, we’ll be very fortunate.’

Defender Steven Taylor – whose last league start came in May - was another brought in from the cold, and he says the squad have never doubted their team-mate.

‘If you speak to any of the players, they’ll all tell you that Gabby is a top quality player,’ he said.

‘He’s in there all the time, in the gym, working hard, his work-rate has been spot on.

‘He was brilliant. He caused so many problems for them. He was an outlet and that’s something we’ve not had. He’s just not had the chances.’

Newcastle, however, remain in the bottom three with a trip to Spurs and the visit of Liverpool either side of a Capital One Cup tie at Manchester City.

Victory in any of those three and Ashley might just be paying another visit to his team’s dressing-room.

Before then, though, he has to pay someone to fix that cheap telly.
