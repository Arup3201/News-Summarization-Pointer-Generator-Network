For most of us, the thought of scaling the side of a building without any safety gear is enough to induce a nervous sweat.

But for Yaroslav Segeda and his friends from Ukraine, standing on top of giant structures without a harness is their idea of a fun day out.

Known as 'skywalkers', these brave and slightly fool-hardly adventurers practice a sport known as urban exploration, aiming to find and photograph lost, abandoned, or inaccessible places in cities.

While there are many different types of urban explorer, skywalkers, as their name suggests, tend to prefer scaling rooftops, construction cranes and factory towers, as opposed to crawling through old drains or pipe networks.

Using their experience, a bit of know-how, and blueprints from library archives, Segeda and his friends select some of the tallest buildings in Ukraine to scale, before stopping for an obligatory selfie at the top.

As well as climbing these impressive structures in Kiev, the group has also visited and climbed the International Business park in Moscow, and delved deep underground into a gypsum mine in eastern Ukraine.

The group spend their spare time identifying and climbing some of the tallest buildings in Russia and Ukraine before taking a stomach-churning picture at the top

Segeda takes on the climbing missions without any safety harness or equipment. At least one urban explorer is thought to have died in Ukraine

While most urban explorers tend not to use and equipment, one thing that is required is plenty of upper body strength to perform death-defying stunts

In this dizzying image, Segeda leans backwards to take a picture of his friend as he climbs to the top of a tall building in Kiev

While Segeda and his friends spend most of their time in Ukraine (pictured), where they live, they have also scaled buildings in neighbouring Russia

The only tools Segeda and his friends use on their adventures are sturdy pairs of shoes, rucksacks, and of course cameras to capture the view from the tops of buildings

Segeda spends most of his time in cities, but has also ventured out to old industrial complexes (pictured), and has crawled through tunnels into abandoned mine shafts
