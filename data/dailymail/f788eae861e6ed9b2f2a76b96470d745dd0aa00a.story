Poor performances by Britain's elite swimmers has been blamed on them training in the 'wrong water' by a top coach.

Bill Furniss, head of British Swimming, says perfect conditions at Sheffield's Ponds Forge pool hampers competitors because they cannot replicate their fast times anywhere else in the world.

Britain's swimmers won less than half the expected medals at the London 2012 Olympics last year and in the recent World Championships in Barcelona.

Perfect: Ideal conditions at Sheffield's Ponds Forge pool is hampering competitors because they cannot replicate their fast times anywhere else in the world

Top national and international competitions and trials are held at Ponds Forge which was built for the 1991 World Student Games.

The pool is well known for recording fast times because of its design and consistency of the water.

The amount of ozone and oxygen in the water helps improve buoyancy and the depth and design cuts down the resistance. 

But Furniss says the perfect conditions means swimmers can't reproduce their fast times.

Steve Parry (right) both believe training in Sheffield's Ponds Forge pool is 
putting swimmers at a disadvantage                                                              

He said: 'Sheffield is a problem. I don't want trials there. In the future we will question that. I would rather use slower pools.

'It is a fast pool and these guys swim there all the way through their career.'

Former British international swimmer Steve Parry agrees with Furniss.

He said: 'Most people don't spend their lives in competitive swimming so to hear of a fast pool does sound daft but it's proved to be very fast.

'Ponds Forge seems to have the perfect depth of three metres because it's all to do with the resistance in the water and also there's the consistency of the water.

'Because it's got ozone and oxygen in it, it's very buoyant so that allows people to swim faster as well.

'Ponds Forge is just a fantastic facility. It is a victim of its own success because it is so good. All our swimmers go there, post really fast times and then can't replicate it later in the year. I think that's working against them.'
