Though required by the police department in Ferguson, Missouri, a use-of-force report documenting the shooting that killed teenager Michael Brown 'doesn't exist,' it has emerged.

Megan Asikainen, Ferguson's City Clerk, has claimed there is no use-of-report, Yahoo News reported, saying she 'said multiple times that the document doesn’t exist.'

Asikainen expressed similar sentiments to MailOnline, following a public records request under Missouri's Sunshine Law.

The Ferguson police department states in its 2010 General Orders rulebook that use-of-force reports must be filed, the news site noted.

'Use of Force Report is required for all use of force incidents, to include the pointing of weapons or using weaponless, hand-to-hand control techniques even though they have little or no chance of producing injuries when gaining control over, or subduing non-compliant or resisting persons,' the rulebook says, a copy of which was obtained by the website.

The rulebook also states that if a police officer shoots and injures someone, 'The watch commander will complete the Use of Force Report F-080 and forward it through the chain of command to the chief,' Yahoo News pointed out. 

Police Chief Tom Jackson did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline. 

This week, Jackson appeared in a taped video, in which he regretted the time Michael Brown's body was kept outside, saying 'it was just too long.'

The Ferguson police department violated a state law when it failed to include the 'name of the victim and immediate facts' in a police report on the Michael Brown shooting, Yahoo News reported. 

Brown was shot by police officer Darren Wilson last month - and there is no use-of-force report for a February 2013 incident Wilson was involved with, according to the news site. 

Asikainen told MailOnline there is no use-of-force report for the February incident. 

'I don't think there can be any explanation for the absence of a report other than it is still being reviewed by the chain of command,' criminal justice professor Matthew Hickman told Yahoo News.

Citing the St. Louis County Police Department, Hickman said 'With an outside agency doing the [criminal] investigation, Ferguson may just be in a holding pattern.'

A request for comment to the Ferguson city council was not immediately answered, either.
