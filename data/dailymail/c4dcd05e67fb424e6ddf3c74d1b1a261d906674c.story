The average Briton eats four servings of cheese a week

We Britons certainly do love to keep things local, as over three quarters of us (80 per cent) go crackers for cheddar, crowning it our favourite cheese variety.

Least favourite cheeses, according to a new survey, are Greek feta, French Camembert and American cream cheese. 

And while the French are renowned for their love of the stinky stuff, we are not far behind, with the average Briton eating their way through four servings a week.

The research, which was conducted by pickle brand Branston also revealed that a surprising one in four cheese fanatics (26 per cent) admit to eating melted cheese with everything.

A third of Brits (30 per cent) say they can't enjoy cheese without a dollop of their favourite pickle while almost three quarters admitted to reaching out for a cheese sandwich when feeling peckish.

In fact, three in ten office workers tuck into cheese sandwiches for lunch each work day without fail.

If we're not putting slices in our sandwiches, one in ten of us are eating whole blocks of cheese in one sitting.

Our second favourite is mozzarella with almost two in five (38 per cent) enjoying the ever versatile soft Italian cheese. 

Close behind in third place is traditional red Leicester (32 per cent). 

The French cheese board staple Brie placed fourth (29 per cent) followed by Italian Parmesan in fifth (24 per cent).

1. Cheddar (80%)

2. Mozzarella (38%)

3. Red Leicester (31%)

4. Brie (29%)

5. Parmesan (24%)

6. Stilton (23%)

7. Wensleydale (21%)

8. Feta (20%)

9. Camembert (18%)

10. Cream cheese (14%)

Another survey, this one by Lurpak, showed 32 per cent of office workers eat an identical lunch each day and have done so for nearly four and a half years on average.

This is the equivalent of eating over 1,000 identical cheese sandwiches. 

Commenting on our attraction to repetition, food psychologist, Greg Tucker, who worked with Lurpak said: 'This research demonstrates that the repetition of eating the same food every day can provide reassurance and stability.

'However we all have an innate desire for exploration and would benefit from shaking things up.

'New tastes and experiences can excite and motivate us, especially when we have a far greater selection of foods to experiment with than we've ever had before.'
