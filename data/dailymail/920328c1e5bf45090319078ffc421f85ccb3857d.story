A nurse who bombarded a surgeon with threatening emails after accusing him of botching her treatment could face being struck off.

Ellen Johnson embarked on a two year campaign of abuse because she felt 'insulted' by the care she received at the hands of Johan Witt, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

She also displayed derogatory posters about him using the acronym A.R.S.E in full view of patients at the University College London hospital where they both worked in central London.

Nurse Ellen Johnson faces being struck off for bombarding a surgeon with abusive emails after complaining about medical treatment to her hip

A conduct and competence committee found all allegations against Johnson proved, but the hearing ran out of time before it could consider whether her actions.

Details of the treatment she received and her medical ailments were heard in private during the week-long hearing.

But in one of the emails Johnson, who walks with the aid of a crutch, referred to her hip condition when she said: 'I did not let you into my life and into my hip journey to make me sick.

'You have not got the right to do this to me or hurt my hips. I wish that I was dead.'

Mr Witt is listed as a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who specialises in hip and knee surgery and joint replacement.

Sarah-Jane Smiles, for the NMC, told the panel that the emails were sent between early 2010, and December 2011.

'In an email on September 24, 2010, Ms Johnson stated, "you did this to me you b****d, you will pay for this".'

In another email she called him weasel and went on to tell him that he would pay for what he had done to her.

'The emails got more threatening towards Mr Witt and were inappropriate because the majority of them use bad language and make a personal attack on a member of staff,' said Ms Smiles.

On one occasion Mr Witt's secretary noted that a single email had been sent a total of 30 times within a 10 minute period.

Johnson had also made and displayed posters on the ward, the content of which was 'particularly derogatory' towards staff and the hospital.

Ms Smiles told the panel that one of the posters displayed the acronym A.R.S.E 'for effect' although it is not known what the letters stood for.

Johnson admitted sending the emails but denied that her behaviour had been inappropriate.

She said she had disagreed with Mr Witt's diagnosis and treatment and had launched a clinical negligence claim in May this year.

Asked by Ms Smiles whether her emails were inappropriate, Johnson replied: 'I would say that if I was receiving these from a patient, I would be thinking "what on earth have I done?".

'I would be disappointed with myself for leaving someone feeling like this.'

Johnson, who represented herself at the central London hearing, told the panel that she 'may or may not' see them again when the case resumes on December 17.
