David Moyes' hard-line stance towards Champions League bad boys Tom Cleverley, Danny Welbeck and Ashley Young has stretched to a further day of extra training today.

Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday morning that the three Manchester United stars had been fined and kept behind for extra work yesterday after being photographed on a late night out after returning from the club’s European exit at Bayern Munich a week ago.

Now it is understood that Cleverly, Welbeck and Young did another arduous session of added training at Carrington today after the rest of Moyes’ team had finished their work.

The three England players were in Munich last week as United lost 3-1 against Bayern and only returned to Manchester mid-afternoon the next day.

But that night they were photographed in high spirits in the city centre on an excursion that continued in to the early hours.

Moyes thought the behaviour was inappropriate, given the circumstances, and is now driving his message home. The United manager was particularly disappointed, given that the likes of Cleverley and Young should be concentrating on trying to force their way in to the first team.

Of the three, only Welbeck is expected to play as Moyes returns to his old club Everton in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday.

Meanwhile, striker Wayne Rooney is not expected to feature as the England star has not trained since playing in Munich with a chipped bone on his toe.
