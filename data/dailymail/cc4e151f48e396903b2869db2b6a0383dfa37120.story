They are some of the most successful and controversial games ever made. And now, gamers can catch the first glimpse of Call of Duty's latest installment, Ghosts.

Coming soon to a next-gen console near you: The next Call of Duty game will use a new engine

Although Infinity ward and Activision are keeping most details under wraps, Ghosts is likely to take place in the future, but utilise current technology and weapons in line with a 'major plot event'.

The single-player campaign is said to
 include more destructible environments, with multiplayer maps featuring
 interactive areas and traps.

No
 characters have been confirmed for the game, however, there are rumours
 that Ghosts will be powered by an all-new next generation Call of Duty 
engine.

This is likely to please fans, given that the last game, Black Ops 2, looked dated compared to many current-gen releases.

This year has seen around 40 million active gamers playing Call of Duty every month.

Within 24 hours of going on sale, last year's Black Ops 2 - which was also set in the future - grossed more than $500m, becoming the biggest entertainment launch of all time.

Call of Duty: Ghosts will be released in November.
