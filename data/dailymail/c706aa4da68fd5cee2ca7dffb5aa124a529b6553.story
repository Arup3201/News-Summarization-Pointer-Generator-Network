A basketball trainer may have been killed by a man he met in the dating section of Craigslist.

Thomas Bashline, 42, who worked for the Harlem Globetrotters, was found dead by his girlfriend in Frederick, Colorado, two weeks ago.

Initially police believed he may have been killed over drugs tests that he carries out on athletes across the U.S.

However, that is not the case and 
sources within the Weld County police department now say Bashline met 
the suspect on the man-for-man personals section on the website.

Officers believe that he had driven 15 miles to Longmont where he picked the man up before taking him back to his home.

There it is believed the suspect shot Bashline in the head before stealing his Chevy S-10 truck which was found in 22 miles away in Boulder, Col.

Officers also said that the man they have in custody is answering questions on an unrelated charge but evidence they found inside the stolen vehicle had linked him to the crime.

His brother, Richard, has refused to speak about the latest turn of events, but soon after Thomas Bashline was killed he told Fox 31 Denver: 'It's not natural, it wasn't suicide. It was murder.'

Bashline had been a high school trainer for 10 years before being hired by the blue team of the Globetrotters three years ago, according to the Denver Post.

Initial reports suggested he had been murdered because of drugs tests he carried out, but that is now not thought to be the case

Jeff Munn, executive vice president of the club, said: 'We have just learned of the tragic loss of one of our trainers, Thomas Bashline.

'Our condolences go out to Tom's family and friends. The entire Harlem Globetrotters organisation is deeply saddened by this news.'

Bashline was also a businessman, operating a company that administered drugs tests across the U.S. for baseball, basketball and football players.

On the morning that Bashline was killed he was due to go to family friend Myrna Lloyd's house to work on her computer.

He called her and said he would be there in the afternoon instead.She said: 'I'm totally flabbergasted. I can't fathom it. He was a very good man.'
