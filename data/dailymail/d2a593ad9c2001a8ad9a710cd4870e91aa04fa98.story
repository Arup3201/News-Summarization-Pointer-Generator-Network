Kara Rann, 27, died 10 days after falling from her bike during a race, where she suffered head injuries

A woman motorbike racer died 10 days after she fell from her bike whilst travelling at 180mph and suffered serious head injuries during a race.

Kara Rann, 27, lost control on a hairpin bend and was thrown from her Yamaha R6 motorcycle whilst competing at Pembrey Racing Circuit in Carmarthenshire, West Wales.

The mother-of-one was airlifted to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff following the accident on September 14, and doctors spent 10 days trying to save her.

Her boyfriend Marc McCullough, 25, who had been cheering her on at the NG Road Racing event, said: ‘Kara was so badly injured she lost her fight.’

Mr McCullough, who is also a motorcyclist, kept a vigil at her bedside as she was placed in a medically induced coma.

The sportswoman, who has a five-year-old son named Brogan, passed away last Wednesday, September 24.

Ms Rann had been riding motorbikes since the age of 14 but only took up racing a year ago.

She had been campaigning for a TT-style race around the Isle of Wight where she lived - and her friends are planning to organise the event, naming it in her memory.

A spokesman for Pembrey Racing Circuit said: ‘In race Number two there was an incident involving a 27-year-old female competitor, who fell from her Yamaha R6 motorcycle at Hatchets Hairpin.

‘The rider suffered serious head injuries and was treated at the circuit by the circuit’s medical team.

‘The competitor was then airlifted by Wales Air Ambulance to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff at 10.55am.

She lost control on a hairpin bend and was thrown from her Yamaha R6 motorcycle whilst competing at Pembrey Racing Circuit in Carmarthenshire, West Wales. She was airlifted to hospital but died 10 days later

‘The Health and Safety Department of Carmarthenshire Council has been informed.’

Public protection officers have visited the circuit and are investigating the accident.

NG Road Racing, the event she was taking part in, has 600 competing members who undertake the Championship Series at circuits around the country.
