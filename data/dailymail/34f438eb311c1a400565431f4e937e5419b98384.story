Roberto Martinez wants Everton’s players to wreck Steven Gerrard’s Merseyside derby farewell and banish their own wretched record in this famous fixture.

Everton have beaten Liverpool only four times since the turn of the millennium. Their last win was in October 2010, a run in all competitions that stretches nine matches, so recent form makes Brendan Rodgers’ side favourites to ensure Gerrard’s 33rd derby appearance is a successful one.

Rodgers wryly observed that Evertonians would probably be glad to see the back of Gerrard, who will join LA Galaxy in the summer, but Martinez feels Everton’s players are ready to inject some momentum into their campaign.

Premier League: Games - 29, Won - 16, Drawn - 9, Lost - 4, Win % - 55.1, Goals - 9, Assists - 4, Bookings - 3, Red cards - 2

Cup: Games - 3, Won - 1, Drawn - 1, Lost - 1, Win % - 33.3%, Goals - 1, Assists - 0, Bookings - 0, Red cards - 0

Victory at Crystal Palace last Saturday was Everton’s first since December 15 and Martinez hopes that will prove to be a turning point. The Everton manager is aware of the emotion surrounding Gerrard but hopes he leaves Goodison Park with a defeat.

‘There is going to be a lot of talk about Gerrard but the only thing that matters to us is to try to use this as a springboard for our season,’ said the Spaniard.

‘We picked up a very important win last weekend. The derby comes at the perfect moment for us. It can kick-start our season after the good moment we are sharing.

‘If you want to grow as a team you need a strong rival and a strong rivalry. We had that last season. I’m not too concerned about the record for the last 20 years. I’m more concerned about what the record is going to be in the next 20 years.’

The build-up to this game is not entirely settled for Martinez, who is ready to take a chance on the hamstrung James McCarthy. Kevin Mirallas has cast doubt on his future at Goodison and suggested he may leave in the summer.

Tottenham were keen on signing Mirallas in January but never made a bid. The Belgium international has never said he wants to leave but, with 18 months left on his contract, he feels he is approaching the stage where he has to review his situation.

‘I like it over here but I feel ready for a new challenge,’ said Mirallas. ‘I dream of playing in the Champions League next season, with Everton or with another club. I just have to see after the season.

‘Don’t forget, the 2015 Europa League winners will qualify for the following season’s Champions League. I like the Premier League but Spain tempts me. Atletico Madrid have enquired, but there was no offer.’

For Liverpool, the build-up to this fixture has been relatively smooth and confidence is high following the dramatic FA Cup win at Bolton. Rodgers’s main decision is whether to start Daniel Sturridge or use the England striker from the bench.

‘He is not far away from starting, he is really champing at the bit,’ said Rodgers. ‘But we want to make sure he is going to be available now for the rest of the season. If the timing is not quite right it can hurt us.

‘His appetite to play is there, which is great. I need to speak with my staff and Daniel and make a decision. It is difficult because these are games that we want to win, so it is hard if someone only needs 30 or 45 minutes.’
