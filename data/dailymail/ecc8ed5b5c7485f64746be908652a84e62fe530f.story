Tragic: Oskar, a seven-year-old dachshund, is the first reported victim to die from poisonous meatballs scattered in the streets of San Francisco

A dog has died after eating one of hundreds of meatballs laced with rat poison and scattered around San Francisco's streets.

It is the first reported death of a pet from the sick hoax, and has left owner Dorothy Schechter devastated at her loss.

Oskar, a seven-year-old dachshund, was one of two dogs that were reportedly struck down after eating the contaminated meat.

But yesterday,Â NBC San Diego reported that Oskar had died on Thursday.

Heartbroken Ms Schechter told the news service her home is now silent.

She said: 'It's extremely important to
show you can't get away with something like this and so Oskar didn't 
die in vain,' she said.

'I feel like my insides have been torn up because it was such a horrible way to go.'

Police have collected nearly 100 poisoned meatballs across neighborhoods in the city since July 3, the news service said.

Oskar ingested one of the meatballs near Crestline Drive and Burnett Avenue in Twin Peaks.

Poison: Hundreds of meatballs laced with rat poison, like those pictured, have been scattered around San Francisco in an apparent attempt to sicken or even kill local dogs

Victim: Oskar, pictured, was one of at least two animals who were struck down after eating the tainted meat. Oskar died a few days later

Mean: Police still do not know who made the meatballs, believed to contain the poisonous substance strychnine, or left them in the street, but the investigation is ongoing

Police are warning residents about 
the nasty prank they called a 'truly unusual' crime after the meatballs 
were discovered in the Twin Peaks, Diamond Heights, Lower Haight, Cole 
Valley, Hayes Valley and Bernal Heights neighborhoods.

Concerned community members have 
collected and disposed of hundreds of the balls, placed deliberately in 
areas where dogs frequent.

Park Police station Inspector Joseph Nannery said someone may have planted the malicious meatballs because they dislike barking dogs, they feel threatened, or are tired of the pets pooping in the area.

He was being treated at Animal Internal Medicine and Specialty Services after he began having seizures immediately after eating the meat. He was placed on a ventilator, but did not pull through.

Pet-loving police at Park station pooled together $250 to donate to Oskar's recovery. According to Ms Schechter, she faces a $26,000 vet bill, according to the San Francisco Examiner.
