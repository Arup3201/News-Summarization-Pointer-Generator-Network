A homeless man who came to New York City to find work woke up Saturday poor and despondent.

But by the day's end the 53-year-old father-of-two was on his way back to his native Czech Republic thanks to a group of selfless strangers.

Jaroslav Nemcovsky flew from his home outside Prague to Orlando, Florida, in September but lost his job and traveled to Manhattan in a desperate bid to find work.

Once there however, things only worsened for the already down-on-his-luck immigrant when he was robbed after falling asleep charging his cell phone at Port Authority.

With no money, no passport and no shoes, Nemcovsky thought he would die on the harsh, and increasingly wintery, streets of the Big Apple.

But all that changed when Brandon Levithan, owner of clothing company Thread Society, and his friends came across him sitting solemnly in Union Square last weekend.

'We didn't think he was homeless. We weren't sure we wanted to approach him,' Levithan, who was distributing warm clothes to the city's poor at the time, told the New York Daily News Tuesday.

In a heartwarming YouTube video that has now gone viral, Levithan is seen approaching Nemcovsky, who doesn't speak English but was able to communicate with Levithan's girlfriend, Simona Kanevsky in Russian. 

'I explained to him that we were a clothing company giving out sweatshirts, hats and gloves,' Kanevsky said. 'I asked if he wanted anything and all he responded with was, "I just want to go home... to Czech."'

Help: The group took Nemcovsky to a hotel to get cleaned up and gave him new clothes and pizza

Barber: They then took him for a haircut and a shave

First things first, the couple, and their friends, took Nemcovsky, who hadn't showered for two weeks to a nearby hotel where they got him cleaned up, gave him new clothes and fed him some New York pizza.

They then took him to a corner barber for a shave and a hair cut. He was a new man.

'He was so grateful, explaining to me that he has never had a beard so long in his life and hasn't been able to shave in two months,' Kanevsky told the Daily News.

Back at the hotel, he elaborated on his struggles since arriving in the states.

'He was robbed of his phone, his passport. He had $1,000 -- they even took his shoes,' Levithan said. 'He said he went to police for help and they laughed at him.'

Tears: Explaining his struggle, the 53-year-old teared up and was so grateful

Friends: The group left Nemcovsky at the hotel to rest for a while as they pondered how they could help fulfil his wish to return to Czech

The Czech Consulate were able to replace his passport, but gave him no other help in getting home.After 10 days of sleeping in a homeless shelter, he said he was kicked out and, when Levithan and his friends found him, he was sleeping in Union Square.

Describing how he just wanted to get home and see his son and daughter, he teared up.

The group left Nemcovsky at the hotel to rest for a while as they pondered how they could help fulfil his wish to return to Czech.

When they returned, they surprised him with a one-way ticket leaving from JFK Airport early the next morning.

Flight: Levithan said they got him on the flight, pictured, around eight hours after they first met him, desperate and alone, in Union Square

'I can only imagine being on the street, alone in a different country where nobody speaks the language. We just wanted to get him home with his family,' Levithan told the Daily News.

Levithan said they got him on the flight around eight hours after they first met him, desperate and alone, in Union Square.

And they're looking forward to hearing from him once he's settled back home, Levithan said, adding that they exchanged contact information.

But for now, the group are just happy at the difference they were able to make in helping a complete stranger who was down on his luck, and hope their selfless actions inspire others to assist those less fortunate.

'It's the holiday season. We were there to do good. Giving shirts and warming people is really nice deed. Giving him a fresh start and getting him where he needs to be — that's what motivated us to go through with this,' said Levithan. 'I think I got more out of it than I thought I would.'
