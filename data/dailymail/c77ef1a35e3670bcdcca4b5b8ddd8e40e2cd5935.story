The former head of the military has hit out at the government’s defence cuts, saying they could leave Britain with an army more suited to a ‘banana republic’.

Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, who stood down last summer, said the reduced numbers of regular soldiers would be ‘a problem’ if the country was involved in another long-running conflict.

In a separate swipe at defence secretary Philip Hammond, he said he respected him, but suggested he was not ‘clubbable’, and said that he would ‘never make a soldier’.

And Lord Richards said he had disagreed with the strategy of cutting soldier numbers and relying increasingly on reservists - claiming he was not involved in the decision, which was taken out of his hands.

Around 20,000 soldiers will be cut over the next four years in the largest redundancy programme ever attempted, coinciding with the end of Britain’s 13-year campaign in Afghanistan.

But the peer - formerly General Sir David Richards – warned that a failure to retain quality people in the army, navy and air force would be disastrous for the long term future of the forces.

‘You will always have an army or armed forces. Every country does’, he said.

‘The difference between the British armed forces and those of most other countries, and I’ve come across many, is the quality of our people. We don’t pay them brilliantly by any means. Only now, when I’m outside, do I realise for the first time what people can be paid.

‘But because we look after them and because it’s socially at every level acceptable to be in the Army.

Whether you are a private in the greenhouse from Yorkshire, or the heir to the throne, or you are a captain in some smart organisation, the fact is there is a consensus that it’s a good to be in the armed forces.

‘If you lose that because you don’t look after your people well, you will have an army, a navy and an air force, but it will be the sort of army, navy and air force with which we don’t associate with the British, that you associate with banana republics ultimately.’

Lord Richards commanded the armed forces in Afghanistan in 2006-7 and was made Chief of the Defence Staff in 2010.

Cutting the numbers of soldiers to 82,000 meant on similar sustained campaigns ‘they yes, we would have a problem. Our regular soldiers would have to go back more frequently than is desirable.’

This would be a long-term problem, but by 2020, he said, ‘the British forces will look very impressive, will still be the second biggest spender in Nato and after the Americans we will be the most capable.’  

While he added that he would always wonder if people would feel he let the forces down by allowing soldiers to be made redundant, he had felt it was crucial to get the economy back on track.

As to relying on reservists, he said this decision was taken out of his chain of command, and he had argued for smaller cuts.

In his maiden speech to the House of Lords this week, Lord Richards said Britain’s armed forced would need more resources to deal with the global threat of jihadis, and called for defence spending to increase as the economy starts to grow or the forces’ effectiveness ‘will inevitably deteriorate’.
