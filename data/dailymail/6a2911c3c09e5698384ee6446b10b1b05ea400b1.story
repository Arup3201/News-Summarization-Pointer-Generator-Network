Derby head coach Steve McClaren has signed a new three-year contract.

First-team coach Paul Simpson and goalkeeping coach Eric Steele have also extended their deals until 2017.

The trio joined Derby at the end of September last year, following the decision to sack Nigel Clough, and transformed the Rams from Sky Bet Championship also-rans to promotion contenders, with the club reaching the play-off final at Wembley where they lost to a late QPR goal.

Former England boss McClaren told the club's official website: 'I'm delighted to sign a new contract with Derby County, along with Paul Simpson and Eric Steele, who are vital members of our coaching structure.

'Derby County is a club that is close to all our hearts and we're all delighted to commit our futures to what continues to be an exciting project.

'I have enjoyed working alongside president and chief executive Sam Rush and the rest of the executive team, as well as the ownership group who have a fantastic passion for the club to be successful.

'The fans have bought into what we're trying to achieve and their backing has been nothing short of magnificent.

'Last season ended in heartbreaking fashion, but we all have our focus on the future now and there's a real excitement for the season ahead.'
