A 64-year-old man miraculously survived with his head trapped underneath his overturned snowmobile for 20 hours overnight in running water as the temperature fell to 13 below freezing.

Volunteer rescuers close to the Canadian border in Maine, discovered Paul Lessard lying in a stream with his head underneath the heavy machine's rear storage rack at 7.45am on Wednesday morning.

Survivor: Paul Lessard, 64, (centre) spent 20 hours trapped underneath his snowmobile before being rescued by volunteers Phil Corriveau and his son Tyler

Mr Lessard, known locally as 'Moses, had overturned the machine and landed in a watery ditch adjacent to the trail after setting off for a ride near Black lake in Maine's St John Plantation on Tuesday morning.

He was eventually found by Phil Corriveau, owner of the local Arctic Cat snowmobile dealership, and his son Tyler, who had volunteered to join the search.

Speaking to Maine's Bangor Daily News, Mr Corriveau said: 'We saw a track that went in but that did not come back out.

'I was pretty sure it was an Arctic Cat track, so I told my son, "Let’s go see." We could not see [Lessard] at all, The sled was on top of him.

'He moved his arm and said, "you found me.” We told him to hang on.'

Mr Lessard crashed as he rode the snowmobile near Black Lake, close to the Canadian border in Maine

Tyler Corriveau called wardens on his cellphone and the two men attempted to move the sled to free Lessard, but it was too heavy.

They managed to shovel away enough snow to free Lessard’s head.

Mr Corriveau added: 'It’s just plain luck we found him there. It was only 8 degrees this morning.'

Mr Lessard of Milford, Massachusetts, had been reported missing around 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday by his friend Nelson Gagnon who was expecting to meet him for supper. The initial search was called off at 2.30am.

Mr Lessard was taken to Northern Maine Medical Center in Fort Kent and subsequently transferred by ambulance to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor where he was in stable condition.
