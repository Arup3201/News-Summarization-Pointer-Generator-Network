Parents claim their teenage daughters have been left in tears, and worrying about their weight after teachers told the pupils their trousers were too tight.

Furious mothers and fathers claim their daughters have been left upset and 'feeling fat' after the  row at Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire.

Parents say their children have been told by teachers their black school trousers are too tight around the 'calf and bottom areas' and are not part of the school uniform.

And another pupil claims they were told by teachers: 'It's not my fault you can't find trousers big enough'.

Sian Hart said her 13-year-old daughter, Jaydee, was among those taken out of class and told her trousers were too tight.

She said: 'She has been wearing the same uniform ever since she started at Headlands.

'She's very skinny and tall and I really struggle to find trousers that fit her.

'I bought her trousers from New Look, in the school range, and to me she looks perfectly fine but apparently the school thinks the trousers are too tight.'

The mother-of-three said Jaydee and her friend were both taken out of an English lesson over the issue.

She said: 'They have threatened to put them in isolation. A girl in the year above my daughter has been excluded for wearing tight trousers.

'I am not buying any more trousers, it's ridiculous. There are more pressing issues the school should be concentrating on.'

The angry parents of the schoolgirls have now launched a Facebook group, called Headlands Parents Uniform Unite, to complain.

One parent posted her views on the Facebook group and said: 'My daughter is now in floods of tears about this issue.

'She has come home today after a warning that her "trousers may be causing an infringement as they are tight around the calf and bottom area".'

The parent claimed the trousers had previously passed a uniform check by the headteacher.

Another parent posted: 'My daughter was told "it's not my fault you can't find trousers big enough" and she was not the only one to be told this.

'Girls have put on Facebook how they now feel fat and extremely upset.'

Headteacher Sarah Bone said the school has high expectations about the school uniform, which parents were consulted about in 2012.

Sarah Bone said: 'All students are required to wear full school uniform at all times, including to and from school.

'Where parents are having difficulty with the cost of uniform, I would ask them to contact their head of year for a confidential discussion.

'Dealing with inappropriate uniform matters detracts from time devoted to learning, so thank you to all our parents and students who have supported us in this matter.

'Students who are not in correct uniform, in line with Department for Education guidance, may be sent home to change or secluded from other students at breaks and lunchtimes.'

During the first week of term, Mrs Bone said five students were either sent home or placed in isolation over uniform issues.
