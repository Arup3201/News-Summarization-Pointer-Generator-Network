A man caught on video slapping a woman in the face during a brawl on the New York subway has had charges against him dropped after investigators determined that he acted in self-defense.

Jorge Pena said he was ‘horrified’ he had to hit a woman, but she gave him no choice.

‘Believe me, if she don't touch me like that... I'm never gonna put my hands on her. Never,’ said Dominican-born Pena.

A tearful Pena said he was left with no choice after Danay Howard attached him with her 6-inch high-heel shoe and injured his ear

In the video, he is repeatedly mocked by 21-year-old Danay Howard who criticizes his 8-Ball jacket and accent before hitting him in the face with her 6-inch high-heel shoe. 

At that point Pena, who is 6 foot 6 inches tall, slap the woman in the face and a brawl ensued as several of her friends jumped in.

He had been charged with misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct charges after cell phone footage of the incident in an uptown F train around 5 a.m. on Saturday.

Pena was left bleeding profusely after being attacked and at a press conference on Thursday and he showed off his injured ear.

A tearful Pena said if he hadn't been provoked he would never have hit a woman - or anyone else, reports NBC4.

He also said that the sorry incident had left him scared to use the subway and to even wear his favourite 8-Ball jacket.

'I can’t wear my jacket anymore,' said Pena, explaining that he was worried it might provoke an unwelcome response from someone who recognized him from the incident.

Pena moved to New York City from the Dominican Republic to play minor league baseball for the Oakland A's, but his pitching career was sidelined when he injured his leg in 2010. 

Howard and Pena were both arrested at the West 4th Street subway station at about 5 a.m. on Saturday along with Howard's friends Kevin Gil, 21, and Shanique Campbell, 20, who had jumped into the fight to support her.

Howard, the woman who was shockingly slapped across the face, has been hit with the most severe charges - felony assault and disorderly conduct. Gil, and Campbell each face misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct charges.

In the footage, Howard can be seen taunting Pena on the Washington Square station-bound F train, when she was slapped so hard that she almost fell over.

Another man jumped to her defense as the scene descended into chaos with the men raining punches down on each other. 

The video shows Howard on the train with her friends telling Pena, who is wearing a leather 8 Ball jacket and fur hat, to stay away before she starts to insult his clothing.

Her friends egg her on and clap as she throws insults at the unnamed man, who nods and smiles at her.

Howard tells Pena: 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s.'

As she is holding a pair of high-heeled snake skin boots she says: ‘I’m done. You wanna know what shoes I’ve got on? They’re Steve Madden ones, alright?’ before sitting down.

She was insulting his dress sense and told him 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s'

The young woman's friends jump up when they see that another passenger is recording the argument 

Her attention is then drawn to the man filming the incident after he tells her: ‘Nobody wears Steve Madden no more,’ and her friends jump up and charge towards him asking him what he is doing.

He backs off but Howard knocks the phone from his hand – sending it flying to the ground but it is still recording and he tells her ‘you’re petty as hell – you can’t even afford this.’

The man picks it up but she knocks it from his hands again before continuing her attack on Pena.

'You sound stupid,' she shouts at him from behind before hitting him on the back of his head with her boot.

Howard continues to taunt Pena by telling him he sounds stupid before she hits him on the back of his head

A man steps in in an attempt to break up the fight but is unsuccessful and also ends up in the middle of the fight

He then swiftly turns round and slaps her hard across the cheek, creating a loud smacking noise.

The girl's friend jumps in and the situation quickly spirals out of control with several people trying to hit each other, while the cameraman screams in excitement.

Another man steps in to break up the fight and eventually two of the men are separated. 

The video, titled 'Man smacks the soul out of girl on the NY Subway', has since gone viral and even led to remixed versions online.
