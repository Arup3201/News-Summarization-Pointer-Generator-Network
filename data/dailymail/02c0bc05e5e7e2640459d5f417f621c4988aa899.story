The Muslim convert who shot dead a soldier and brought terror to Canada's Parliament was caught listening to fanatical Jihadi audiotapes encouraging violence with a wanted suspected terrorist, MailOnline can reveal.

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was influenced by radicalized Hasibullah Yusuzfai after meeting at a mosque in Vancouver, it has been claimed.

Yusufzai, 25, has been charged under a new anti-terrorism law for allegedly joining Islamist fighters in Syria after fleeing Canada in January.

Wanted: Hasibullah Yusuzfai, 25, has been charged under new Canadian anti-terror laws after he fled the country to allegedly go and fight for Islamist radicals in Syria. He underwent a dramatic transformation from wannabe hunk, left, to radical, right - in an Interpol wanted poster 

Gunman: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was friends with Yusuzfai in Vancouver where they were seen listening to extremist preachers spew hatred against the West

The pair would spend time together listening to recordings of extremist preachers encouraging acts of violence, according to the father of David Bathurst, one of their Muslim convert friends.

Speaking outside his home in Burnaby, Vancouver, John Bathurst said: 'David often heard these guys play tapes and immediately said "No, that's wrong. What you're listening to is not about what's taught in the Quran." They would be listening to these shocking tapes counseling violence.

'From what I understand from David is that these tapes are coming off-shore from sources that are outside of local influence.'

Up until now Canadian police have only acknowledged that the killer and Yusufzai had contact through social media. This is the first evidence that the pair actually met.

Yusufzai is the only one of around 130 people who have left the country to fight for extremists to have been charged. Another 80 have since returned.  

In a shocking twist, John, 67, confessed to hiring both Yusufzai, in 2013, and Zehaf-Bibaeu, in 2011, for his family business, Bathurst Irrigation, after his son recommended them.

He describes their employment as 'causing a s**t storm' and says their sole duties were to dig holes in the ground with a pitchfork for a few dollars more than minimum wage.

'Hasibullah [Yusufzai] worked for us for two weeks, he had a chip on his shoulder from the day he arrived, he was very angry man,' he explained.

'He's a guy that David met at the mosque before disassociating himself after learning how radicalized he was. 

'I met him, of course, he used to ride a motorcycle. He worked for me for two weeks last year in 2013, he told my son he really needed work and asked for help.

'Normally we have people who come and work for us stay for an entire summer but Michael [Zehaf-Bibeau] lasted only two days.

'I don't remember why he quit but probably because the work is too hard. David would have philosophical discussions with this guy and remembers him being pretty radical and would be talking crazy.'

Convert: David Bathurst, left, befriended fellow Muslim convert Zahef-Bibeau and also Yusufzai. Zahef-Bibeau and Yusufzai even worked at the irrigation business run by David's father, John

Fears: John Bathurst has provided the first evidence that the killer and Yusufzai were friendly in person. The Canadian authorities have only acknowledged publicly that the pair communicated over social media

John told how his son David met the cold blooded killer six weeks ago at a street festival in downtown Vancouver, recalling how Zehaf-Bibeau was unstable and spoke passionately about moving to Syria.

He said: 'Michael told him he wanted to go to Syria which David knew wasn't a good idea because he was unstable. He warned him not to go if he was going to do the devil’s work.

'That was the last conversation they had together, they were associates from meeting at the mosque.'

John admits having to monitor son David's activities for signs of being radicalized since he converted to the religion seven years ago. 

He said: 'Sometimes I have to speak to David about some of the radical stuff that he's heard, for instance he has been on a real British-bashing thing lately and I told him to change his way of thinking.'

Incredibly records from 2011 indicate that Zehaf-Bibeau wanted to be incarcerated to help him with his crack addiction - where he could get treatment in prison. 

He confessed to committing an armed robbery in Quebec ten years prior, although officers couldn't find a record of the crime.

The troubled addict then attempted to rob a McDonalds restaurant in Vancouver with a sharpened stick, according to audio records reported by CTV.

A police report filed shows that an officer described Zehaf-Bibeau as 'happy' when they arrested him.

During the investigation it was ruled that Zehaf-Bibeau did not suffer from any mental illness and was described as being a 'devoted Muslim for seven years'.

John told MailOnline: 'Michael was begging for help, he was mentally ill but for some reason he didn’t get it, he didn’t meet the criteria. David was counseling Michael always telling him: "Don’t do anything unless it’s at the heart of Islam."'

Innocent: Cpl Nathan Cirillo was shot dead by Zahef-Bibeau in Wednesday's attack on the Canadian Parliament

Senseless: Cpl Cirillo's mother, Kathy, weeps as his casket is taken into a hearse ahead of his funeral Friday

John added: 'The situation has made David’s beliefs stronger. I'm so proud of him as a son… but I hate religion.'

Zehaf-Bibeau murdered soldier Cpl Nathan Cirillo, 24, at Ottawa’s war memorial on Wednesday before being shot dead himself as he stormed a nearby parliament building.

A CCTV video released by police shows the gunman hijacking a minister’s car then speeding off towards Centre Block – the main building of the Canadian Parliamentary complex – pursued by police.

After leaving the stolen car he ran into the building and exchanged fire with House of Commons security and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RMCP) before being shot dead by hero Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers.

Meanwhile Zehaf-Bibeau's mother Susan Bibeau told the Associated Press that she had lunch with her son last week after being estranged for five years.

In her statement Mrs Bibeau said her son seemed lost and 'did not fit in'. She added: 'Can you ever explain something like this? We are very sorry.'

RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson told a news conference that Zehaf-Bibeau had a 'history of violence, drugs and mental instability' but was not linked to a Muslim convert that killed a Canadian soldier in a hit and run in Quebec on Monday.

However Paulson said killer Zehaf-Bibeau was trying to get a Libyan passport to travel to Syria.
