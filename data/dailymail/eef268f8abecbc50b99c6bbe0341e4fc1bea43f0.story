Two young men have been killed in a high-speed crash that saw their car career out of control into a tree and burst into a fireball.

The victims, named locally as Craig Jewell, 21, and Josh Tate, 18, were left trapped in the burning wreckage after the car veered off a 40mph dual carriageway and mounted the verge yesterday.

The black Vauxhall Vectra car smashed sideways into a tree outside a row of houses which completely obliterated the middle section of the car.

Police investigate the scene where the Vauxhall Vetra smashed sideways into a tree outside a row of houses

It wrapped around the trunk, cutting it in half, and went up in flames.

The massive impact was heard by 
neighbours in Bournemouth, Dorset, who awoke at shortly after 4.30am and
saw the car on fire. They dialled 999, alerting police, paramedics and 
the fire brigade.

The two men died at the scene from 
injuries they sustained in the accident and the road was closed in both 
directions for 12 hours after the crash.

The accident happened about 50 yards 
before a roundabout and fire crews erected a large tarpaulin screen 
around the burned out car as they worked to release the two victims.

It it thought they were returning home following a night out.

Chief Inspector Steve White of Dorset Police said: 'At approximately 4.45am on Saturday a fatal road traffic collision occurred.

'A black Vauxhall Vectra left the 
road to the near side and collided with a tree. The car was extensively 
damaged and the two occupants died from injuries they had sustained.

'The car also caught fire.'

A witness, who asked not to be named, said he had heard the car go up in flames and saw the blaze reach 35ft high.

He said: 'I was woken up at about 5am to the sound of a crash outside followed by a huge whoosh sound.

Tragic: The car was ripped in half by the high-speed crash and the two victims died at the scene

'There was another similar sound so I looked out of the window and there was a car on fire.

'The flames were about 35ft high and 
were shooting right up to the top of the tree, the petrol tank must have
blown because they were so tall.

'I got straight on the phone and 
called the police as did a couple of our neighbours, it was absolutely 
horrific. They were here very quickly and started asking us to get out.

'The car must have just exploded 
because there were bits of it everywhere, there was a piece right 
outside our front garden and windscreen wipers in the middle of the 
road.

'The car must have been on the 
pavement before it hit the tree because the drivers side hit it first 
apparently, and it must have then spun around with the impact.

'I have no idea what caused it to 
happen, they might have fallen asleep at the wheel or something but they
must have been going pretty fast.'

'They just wouldnâ€™t have survived 
something like that, it was up in flames straight away so I think the 
petrol tank must have split.'

Scene: The crash happened on the northbound carriageway of the 1348 Ringwood Road in the Bear Cross district of Bournemouth

A man who was at the scene and asked not to be named said: 'I have heard that it was two young men who were travelling home after a night out.

'They must have been going very fast and not realised that they were about to encounter a roundabout.

'The damage caused to the car shows how fast they must have been travelling when they slewed off the road.'

The tragic crash happened on the northbound carriageway of the A348 Ringwood Road in the Bear Cross district of Bournemouth, Dorset.

No other vehicle was believed to have been involved in the tragedy.

Police are appealing for witnesses.
