Hull and Aston Villa have enquired about Demba Ba but the Besiktas striker's £80,000-a-week wages are a major obstacle to any deal. West Brom have also considered Ba.

Hull, who hope to have Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez back from injury ahead of schedule for this weekend, are also considering a loan for Manchester United striker Nick Powell. 

Wigan, Derby and Bolton are interested in Powell too despite the player having his season loan at Leicester cut short amid questions over his attitude.

Ba's £80,000-per-week wages pose a problem for any potential Premier League clubs aiming for a deal

Former West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea striker Ba has scored 14 goals in 20 appearances for Besiktas this season.

Ba's stint at Stamford Bridge was limited and he mainly played a role from the substitutes' bench, but Hull and Aston Villa look prepared to show more faith in the forward.

Given Aston Villa's recent goalscoring drought, manager Paul Lambert would see Ba as a major boost in front of goal.
