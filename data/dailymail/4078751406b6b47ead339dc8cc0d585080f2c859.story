A teenager has launched an app that could spell the end for the school run chaos.

It allows users to search for their children's school and co-ordinate with parents making similar journeys.

The app, called ecomumy, is available to download from iTunes and Google Play and is the brainchild of Andrew Christopher, 17, from Morden, south west London.

Brains behind the brand: A new app called ecomumy is the brainchild of 17-year-old Andrew Christopher

He said he came up with the idea after watching 4x4 cars with a seven-seater capacity carrying just three passengers during his slow journey to school.

He said: 'When I travelled to school I would always notice there was a lot of congestion so I wondered if there was a way to resolve this issue and reduce traffic congestion as well as CO2 emissions.

'I would like all the schools in Merton to come forward on the idea of ecomumy so they can use it as a model and help the environment.'

The app is described as: 'Enabling parents to network with fellow mumys and to be part of a group of around 2-4 people to minimise the numbers of school rounds they do weekly, thereby freeing themselves for few full days in a week and reducing the traffic flow.

'The mumys of a same school or even adjacent schools have the potential to network themselves and work together sharing the school rounds with other mumys of the same or adjacent schools.

'The key part of the application is the schedule for small groups being created, which is known as the WeeklyRound.

'A mumy can either join with an already existing WeeklyRound or create a new WeeklyRound and wait for others to approach her and join hers. In each WeeklyRound an average of three mumys can join and work together sharing the school rounds.'

Clever: Andrew came up with the ecomumy idea when he was just 15

Handy: The app allows users to search for their children's school and co-ordinate with parents making similar journeys

Andrew, who is preparing for maths, physics, history and chemistry AS-level exams at King's College School, Wimbledon, said he got into graphic design after designing the website of his father's company.

He said: 'My dad's company bought an Adobe Creative Suite kit and I wanted to try it out. One of his employees taught me when I was 10 and from there I started to self-teach.'

So simple: Andrew got into graphic design after designing the website of his father's company and his new app is easy to use

After coming up with the idea for ecomumy aged 15, he made a story board, mapping out how the app would function, and sent it to developers in India.

He has also submitted it into the Chest competition - a European Union-led initiative inviting innovators to propose solutions to key social challenges

The ambitious teenager said his entry into the tech world is not yet the start of a career and he hopes to study engineering at university.
