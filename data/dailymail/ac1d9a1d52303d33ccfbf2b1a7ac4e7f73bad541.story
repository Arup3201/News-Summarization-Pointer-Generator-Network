West Ham manager Sam Allardyce wants to see sin-bins brought into the Barclays Premier League to help referees avoid sending off players incorrectly.

The former Bolton manager called for an improvement to refereeing standards last season and the issue came to a head last weekend when Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho criticised referee Martin Atkinson and Allardyce hit out at Jonathan Moss after West Ham's draw with Tottenham.

Allardyce sees the introduction of technology as a good thing for the game, and also endorsed the idea of a time-keeper after Harry Kane's late equaliser against the Hammers on Sunday – while favouring a plan to trial sin-bins.

'In terms of sin-bins, I certainly would (trial them),' Allardyce said. 'If you' re talking about a soft yellow and whether or not it should be a sending off I think that's a sin-bin.

'There are times when a player doesn't really deserve to be sent off. With ten minutes in the sin-bin, they come back on and (while they're off) the opposing team has got the chance to take advantage.'

And Allardyce also felt that the impact of suspensions felt by soft red cards was not always in the benefit of the side facing the red-carded player.

Speaking at a You Are The Ref event and discussing of using sin-bins, Allardyce said: 'The player doesn't get banned, he doesn't miss the next game.

'It might be less of an advantage to that team (their opponents) to miss the next game so you don't really gain any advantage from it.'

Former referees chief Keith Hackett also confirmed that he had discussed the idea with representatives from the League Managers Association about the idea.

Allardyce also backed the introduction of a timekeeper after Harry Kane's equaliser against West Ham 

Former referees chief Kieth Hackett added his voice to calls that sin-bins should be given a test

'Yellow cards are reducing the interaction between players and referees,' Hackett said. 'A referee should be saying 'I want an improvement on your behaviour, will you do that'. John Duncan (LMA Technical Manager) favours sin-bins. Whether it's in the conference or somewhere else, it should be tested.'

Allardyce also supports the introduction of video replays and proposed the idea of a 'two challenge' system, similar to the system used in tennis.

Under that ruling, managers would be given two opportunities per game to refer a referee's decision to a video replay if they disagreed with the original judgement.
