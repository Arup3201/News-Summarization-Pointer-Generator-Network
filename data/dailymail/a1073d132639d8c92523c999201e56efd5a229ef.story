A Utah doctor found 
guilty of killing his wife in a trial that became a national true-crime 
cable TV obsession will serve 17 years to life in prison, a state judge 
decided Friday.

The long-awaited sentence 
comes seven years after prosecutors say Martin MacNeill knocked out his 
wife with drugs prescribed following cosmetic surgery and left her to 
die in a bathtub so he could begin a new life with his mistress.

MacNeill,
 58, was sentenced to at least 15 years and up to life in prison on a 
murder charge, plus one to 15 years on an obstruction of justice charge.

A third sentence in a separate sexual abuse case will add another one 
to 15 years.

Judge Derek Pullan ruled Friday 
the sentences will run one after the other. The Utah parole board will 
decide later whether MacNeill can be released after 17 years or must 
serve a longer term.

The one-time doctor and lawyer with a family of eight remained silent during sentencing.

'Mr. MacNeill, as you deprived Michele MacNeill of her life, the state of Utah exacts from you today the liberty that you otherwise might have enjoyed in your remaining years,' Pullan said.Â

Michele
 MacNeill initially was ruled to have died of natural causes, possibly 
heart disease, but her family hounded authorities until charges were 
filed five years after her death.

A sobbing daughter Rachel MacNeill begged Pullan for the maximum sentence.

'He took the kindest, most caring person I've ever known, and he calculatingly took her from us all,' she said, The Salt Lake Tribune reports.

The victim's sister, Linda Cuff, said painful questions lingered about Michele's final moments.

'I shatter thinking of my sister looking at her own husband as he was doing this to her,' she said.

She then paused, and turned toward MacNeill.

'I can finally look into the eyes of my sister's murderer and say, 'Martin, you haven't gotten away with this,' she said.

But when she looked into those eyes, she saw noting.

'He was up there laughing,' she told reporters. 'He showed no remorse. I was not surprised, it was the Martin I've always known.'

Deputy Utah County Attorneey Chad Grunander agreed.

'I think it demonstrates a lack of respect for the process,' Grunander said. 'I think the defendant simply doesn't get it.'

The case against Martin MacNeill shocked the Mormon community of Pleasant Grove, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City.

Martin
 MacNeill has maintained his innocence. His attorney argued at trial 
that Michele MacNeill had a heart attack and fell into the tub, and has 
said an appeal is likely.

Prosecutors conceded
 the largely circumstantial case wasn't an easy one.

Prosecutor Chad 
Grunander said the trail had gone cold by the time he came onto the case
 in 2010, and the judge excluded some evidence of the contention roiling
 under the family's picture-perfect exterior.

'You
 have a doctor and lawyer, beautiful wife, beautiful children, 
well-educated, successful people, and this happens in the background. It
 is shocking to some degree, certainly,' Grunander said.

Last
 year's three-week trial peeled back that facade with testimony from 
jailhouse snitches and Martin MacNeill's former mistress, Gypsy Willis.

Martin
 MacNeill introduced her as a nanny within weeks of his wife's death, 
but his older daughters said they quickly recognized the woman as his 
secret lover and the subject of arguments between their parents.

Prosecutors
 said Martin MacNeill insisted his 50-year-old wife to get a face-lift 
and faked his own medical condition to throw off suspicion in the weeks 
before his wife's death.

They pointed to erratic behavior and what they 
called phony grief the day she died.

Prosecutors
 also introduced testimony from former MacNeill cellmates who said he 
confessed to his wife's death.

Spencer said the jailhouse snitches lied 
and MacNeill should get a new trial, but the judge denied that motion 
late last month.
