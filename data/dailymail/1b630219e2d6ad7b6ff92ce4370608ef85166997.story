It may be 200 years old, but this beautiful automaton silkworm still runs like clockwork.

The jewel-covered 'Ethiopian Caterpillar' was made for Chinese aristocracy in the early 19th century and is one of just six or seven in existence.

Now it is expected to fetch up to £200,000 when it is sold at auction by Sotheby's on Wednesday.

Extravagant: The gold and enamel automaton silkworm is studded with seed pearls, rose diamonds and rubies

Automated: The 'Ethiopian Caterpillar' uses a hidden clockwork mechanism to move like a real-life silkworm

Life-like: The caterpillar's movement is triggered by a tiny lever which starts a clockwork-powered mechanism to drive tiny wheels on its underside

Made around 1810 by Swiss watchmaker Henri Maillardet, the silkworm uses a hidden clockwork mechanism to crawl and mimics the undulating movement of real-life caterpillars.

Its 7cm-long body is made of gold, decorated with coloured enamel and studded with seed pearls, rose diamonds and rubies.

The extravagant decoration is carefully coloured to make this example the most life-like of all the automated silkworms known to exist.

Five of the others are held in European collections, including one at the Patek Phillippe museum and two in the Sandoz collection. The others are in private hands.

It
 was titled the 'Ethiopian Caterpillar' when Maillardet, in partnership 
with legendary watchmaker Jaquet Droz, organized an exhibition to show 
off his menagerie of miniaturised automata in London in 1811.

He created exotic-sounding names to attract the public, hence the invention of the 'Ethiopian Caterpillar', which was accompanied by the 'Egyptian Lizard' and the 'Siberian Mouse'.

According to 
Sotheby's, which sold a similar caterpillar for £200,000 in 2010, it 
has also been referred to as the 'Vers de soie' - meaning 'silkworm'.

Treasure: The automaton silkworm is believed to have been made for the Chinese Imperial Court

Exhibition: A collection of automaton creatures was shown at the Gothic Hall, Haymarket, in 1811

The caterpillar forms part of the auction house's Treasures: Princely Tastes sale of 49 items of furniture and decorative arts which were commissioned by or made for great European rulers and dynasties such as Catherine the Great and Napoleon.

Other items in the sale include a pair of Louis XVI ivory vases, a medal cabinet made for Napoleon and a rock crystal vessel from the early 16th century featuring portraits of Pope Clement VII and Alessandro de Medici, who is thought to be his illegitimate son.

Mario Tavella, deputy chairman of Sotheby’s Europe, said: 'Each of the magnificent pieces in this sale meets the definition of a “treasure”.

'In addition to their desirability relating to the sumptuous materials of which they are composed and the craftsmanship of the greatest artists of their time, these treasures - formerly the preserve of kings, princes and popes – each carry with them a fascinating story.

'The very few similar examples known today are preserved in the world’s most important museums.

'Many of the lots presented in July have been in the same collections for centuries and the sale represents a once in a lifetime opportunity to acquire them.'
