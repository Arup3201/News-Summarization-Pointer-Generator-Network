Manuel Pellegrini has admitted Manchester City have the advantage for Sunday's trip to Liverpool after Brendan Rodgers's side landed back from their Europa League trip to Turkey at 4.20am.

The Chilean, who takes a fully fit squad to Anfield as they look to close the gap on leaders Chelsea to two points, believes Liverpool's late arrival home from their penalty shootout defeat Besiktas will help their cause.

'I think of course it's an advantage,' he said. 'I also played in the Europa League and when you arrive back on Friday it is not the best way to prepare.

'You cannot prepare the game because you finish on Thursday night and you must play on Sunday, the players need at least 48 hours to recover.'

Pellegrini, however, did say that Liverpool's late night would not be the only reason for a City victory.

'It is an advantage for the other team but it is not a decisive one,' he explained.

'If we think we are going to win that game because Liverpool arrive yesterday (Thursday) night late, that is not the reason. We must play very good because they also have a strong squad. I don’t think they will play the same starting 11.'

Pellegrini, who will become back Yaya Toure after he was suspended for Tuesday night's 2-1 Champions League defeat at the hands of Barcelona, is relishing the chance to ramp up the pressure on Chelsea.

'It is important, more than psychologically it is important mathematically,' he said.

'We are going to have three points more, we are going to go two points behind Chelsea because they do not play the next game.

'It is very important to beat Liverpool because they are a strong team and a difficult stadium. And to continue winning in the Premier League in the way we did in the last two games because we won 4-1 and 5-0 against Stoke and Newcastle.

'We will continue fighting until the end to retain the title because we have to play for 36 points more.'

City have a miserable record at Anfield and have not won there since 2003. It is the only Premier League ground at which they have not tasted victory following the 2008 Abu Dhabi takeover.

Last year, on the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough Disaster, they were defeated 3-2 in a match that handed Liverpool the initiative in a title race they would eventually lose to City.

Pellegrini is hoping for a better result this time.

'It was a very special day also because it was the day when we remembered what happened with their fans some years ago,' he said.

'It was a very emotional day. It was a very close game. We couldn’t win for different reasons. This year we go with the same mentality, to try to win and try to be an aggressive team and an attacking team from the beginning.'

Pellegrini refused to analyse the recent performances of captain Vincent Kompany, who some believe was at fault for both Barcelona goals.

'I think he is a great player,' he added.

Pellegrini also declined to discuss contract talks with defender Martin Demichelis and midfielder James Milner, who has been linked with Liverpool.

The trip to Anfield could mean a first start for striker Wilfried Bony, who has come off the bench twice since his £28m switch from Swansea City.

'Bony is working with our team just two weeks,' said Pellegrini.

'We will see which is the best moment for him to start. It is important for him every time that he goes in to give to our team what we know he can do.'
