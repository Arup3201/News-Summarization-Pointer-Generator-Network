A San Francisco Giants fan brutally beaten and left for dead 
outside Dodger Stadium more than two years ago has been 
forced to return home to be cared for by his family after his insurance company refused to continue paying for his medical care.

Father-of-two Bryan Stow was returning to his car after the opening day game between the L.A. Dodgers and the San Fransisco Giants in March 2011 when he was viciously attacked.

He spent months in a medically induced coma after being punched in
 the head, kicked and slammed to the ground outside Dodger Stadium.

Stow, a paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, suffered brain damage and was left permanently disabled.

He has spent the past year at the Centre for Neuro Skills (CNS), a live-in rehab facility in Bakersfield, where his progress has been slow, but steady.

‘Let us clarify something very 
important - Bryan could have benefited greatly by staying at CNS 
longer,’ writes Stow's sister Bonnie and mom Ann on a blog dedicated to telling his story and raising funds for his future care.

‘We are so glad to have him home, but as prepared as we thought we were, it was a difficult transition.’

Stow has spent the past two years in a series of hospitals and rehab centers since the brutal attack in 2011

Back in Santa Cruz, Stow is being cared for by his parents and caregivers hired by his family.

They are attempting to provide the around-the-clock care they claim he needs, but that his insurance company have decided is no longer necessary and are refusing to cover.

'We are now the ones administrating his medical care, scheduling all his
 appointments, and preparing all his meals. We are not complaining… we 
have Bryan home!

'At first look and during 
conversations, Bryan appears to be doing better, cognitively. But to be 
with him as much as we are, we see what others don’t.

'The memory problems, the use of 
words that do not belong, the pain he is in and the stiffness in his 
body that prevents him from being able to do things on his own.

Before the incident Stow was a paramedic, left, while after the accident he spent months in a coma

'Due to a huge cut in therapy 
coverage, Bryan has physically experienced a big setback. We do what we 
can at home, but he needs the five days a week that he grew accustomed 
to. We just don’t know how to get that for him.'

Louie Sanchez and Marvin Norwood were
 arrested for inflicting great bodily injury on Stow, 'causing him to 
become comatose due to brain injury and to suffer paralysis,' according 
to court documents.

They were arrested and charged in the attack following a Los Angeles police investigation.

Investigators describe the assault as
 the culmination of a string of confrontations they had with randomly 
selected Giants fans at the stadium.

Last June, Sanchez and Norwood were ordered to stand trial on charges stemming from the
 attack. Both men have pleaded not guilty.
