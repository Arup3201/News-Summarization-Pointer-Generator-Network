People in Sunderland are more likely to drink themselves to death than anywhere else in the country, Government figures reveal.

Alcohol
killed 36 in the city in 2010 as the number of victims across England 
and Wales rose to 8,970 last year - up 126 since 2009.

Nine
of the ten parliamentary constituencies with the highest number of 
drink-related deaths were in the North – highlighting the social divide 
between the regions.

Bournmouth East, where 27 died, 
was the only voting district in the south to register among these 
hotspots, according to data from the Office of National Statistics.

Just below deprived Sunderland Central
in the alcohol death toll rankings were Bootle, St Helens South & 
Whiston, Birkenhead and Liverpool Walton – all in Merseyside.

Afluent Devizes in Wiltshire had the fewest deaths at two.

The
ONS figures listed the number of deaths directly caused by drinking – 
including alcohol poisoning, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.

The data does not cover deaths caused by drink-related car crashes, violent incidents or linked diseases such as liver cancer.

Two-thirds of victims were men – with the national death rate rising among males from 5,690 to 5,865 in the space of a year.

By contrast, the number of woman who drank themselves to death fell to 2,925 in 2010 from 2,974.

The
North West was the worst affected region of England – with 1229 victims
– followed by the South East (922) and the West Midlands 821.

However,
per head of population, the North East has the highest rate of deaths 
with 22.6 men per 100,000 compared to 21.3 in the North West and 13 in 
the South East.

Deaths in 
the North East have also risen at a faster rate than anywhere else. 
Today’s figure of 469 is nearly three times higher than the 1991 toll of
170.

Worryingly, the rate 
of female deaths across the region has increased by163 per cent since 
1991, compared to a national increase of 67 per cent.

Colin
Shevills, director of alcohol charity Balance, said: ‘Once again our 
region tops the tables and we’ve seen an astonishing leap in alcohol 
related deaths over the last two decades.

‘People are dying because 
alcohol is way too cheap. They’re dying because alcohol is available on 
nearly every street corner at all hours of the day and night.

They’re dying because alcohol is also far too heavily promoted.

‘The
alcohol industry spends something like £800m a year on marketing which 
is having a huge impact on recruiting the next generation of problem 
drinkers from amongst our children.

‘We
need to turn back the rising tide of alcohol related deaths by 
introducing a range of measures which include greater restrictions on 
alcohol marketing and a minimum price per unit of alcohol.’

Prime Minister David Cameron has already signalled his interest in a minimum price of 50p per unit.

Interestingly,
despite the general perception of bingeing teenagers, middle-aged 
people were found to drink more regularly than bingeing young people, 
new figures revealed yesterday.(Thurs)

Those over 45 are three times as likely as younger people to drink alcohol every day, it found.

Very
few young men in their teens and early 20s drink daily, and even fewer 
women. But more than one in five men of pension age open a bottle or a 
can of beer, wine or spirits every day.

Killer: The table shows the North West has the highest actual number of male deaths, with the figure rising across the country from 5,690 to 5,865

Reduction: The number of deaths among women across Britain has fallen over the last three years

The picture of steady drinking by the 
middle-aged is likely to lift some of the taint that attaches to young 
people over alcohol abuse.

The violence and disorder in 
many city centres at weekends, and the pressure on police and hospital 
casualty units that follows, has left young people frequent targets of 
criticism over their drinking habits.
