With three former World Cup winners that had lifted the trophy seven times between them Group D was supposed to be the Group of Death.

For England – and one of Italy or Uruguay – that has proved the case. But not for the fourth nation in the group, Costa Rica.

Jorge Luis Pinto’s team are the first side to seal their place in the last 16 after brilliant wins against top-10 ranked sides Uruguay and Italy.

Fancy footwork: the Costa Ricans show off their dance moves

Following the 1-0 win over Italy in Recife that catapulted them into the next round, Sportsmail has taken a look at this World Cup’s surprise team.

The coachJorge Luis Pinto is coaching Costa Rica for the second time after an unsuccessful stint before the 2006 finals.

The 52-year-old Colombian, who has won league titles in Costa Rica, Peru, Venezuela and Colombia, sets his side up in an attacking 5-4-1 formation, with full-backs Cristian Gamboa and Junior Diaz providing width and energy down the flanks.

Genius: Jorge Luis Pinto has masterminded Costa Rica's success

His side got thumped by Chile, lost to South Korea and Japan, and drew with Republic of Ireland in the months leading up to the World Cup, though they did coast through their qualification campaign, finishing second behind United States, ahead of Mexico and Honduras.

Ranked 28th in the world, Costa Rica’s record in World Cup matches before the Brazil tournament was not pretty. They had won just three of their 10 games, drawing one and losing the other six. Costa Rica legend Paulo Wanchope, known to English fans following spells at Manchester City, Derby and West Ham, is Pinto’s assistant manager.

The stars

Joel Campbell – 35 caps, 10 goals

One of many Costa Rica players to come through the youth system of the country’s top club, Saprissa, Campbell moved to Arsenal in the summer of 2011, though work permit issues have seen him sent out on loan to Lorient, Betis and Olympiakos.

The 21-year-old striker has recently burst on to the radar of Europe’s top clubs having followed up a fine season on loan at Olympiakos with two brilliant performances alone upfront against Uruguay and Italy.

Arsene Wenger has already moved to ward off potential suitors by saying he expects the talented forward to return to Arsenal for pre-season training ahead of next season.

Christian Bolanos – 57 caps, 2 goals

A regular in the Costa Rica midfield since making his debut in 2005 against Norway, Bolanos, now 30, plies his trade in Denmark with Copenhagen having moved to the club four years ago.

One of the standout performers for his first club Saprissa at the 2005 Club World Cup, he was invited for a trial at Liverpool after being named third best player at the competition.

Though he did not do enough to persuade the Merseyside club  to sign him on a permanent deal, Charlton offered the pacey winger a one-year loan deal, only for his work permit application to be turned down.

Bryan Ruiz – 65 caps, 14 goals

The skilful 28-year-old was allowed to leave Fulham to join PSV on loan last season, after dipping in and out of the team during three seasons at Craven Cottage.

A broken foot in 2012 stalled his progress at Fulham, though he has shown signs of his best form in the Eredivisie this season.

His clever passing is vital to Costa Rica’s play, as they look to move the ball to Campbell as quickly as possible.

Ruiz netted his 14th international goal in the 1-0 win over Italy, thumping a header past Gianluigi Buffon and in off the crossbar.

Keylor Navas – 55 caps

Linked with Barcelona following an impressive season at Levante, Navas has pulled off some vital saves in Costa Rica’s first two group games, conceding just once during that time.

Navas, 27, has 55 international caps to his name, having asserted himself as first-choice for his country after making his debut against Suriname in October 2008.

In 2009 he was named the CONCACAF Gold Cup’s best goalkeeper, as Costa Rica reached the semi-finals before being beaten on penalties by Mexico.

Junior Diaz – 64 caps, 1 goal

Costa Rica were dealt a blow before the tournament when Everton defender Bryan Oviedo was ruled out through injury, but Diaz has filled in on the left brilliantly in his absence.

The 30-year-old, who currently plays for Bundesliga side Mainz 05, offers Costa Rica searing pace down the wing, while his crossing ability was also on show against Italy as he provided the assist for Ruiz’s goal.

History

Their previous best performance in a World Cup came on their debut back in 1990, when they advanced to the last 16 having beaten Sweden and Scotland, before they were knocked out by Czechoslovakia.

They did not qualify for another tournament until 2002, where they were knocked out in the group stages.

Their third appearance was one to forget too, as they lost all three of their group games, including a 4-2 thriller on the opening day against Germany.

In 2010 they lost a World Cup qualification play-off against Uruguay but they got revenge in their first group game this time round, winning 3-1 and ending a four-match losing run at World Cups in the process.
