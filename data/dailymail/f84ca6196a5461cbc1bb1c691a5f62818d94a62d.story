An Oklahoma sheriff's deputy captured the heartbreaking moment a frightened puppy was found guarding its owner's body after Monday's tornado - and now he wants to adopt it.

The black dog, splattered in mud, was discovered sitting in debris from a flattened home in the aftermath of the EF-5 twitter that barreled through the heavily-populated suburb of Moore at around 3pm.

The sheriff's office initially released a picture of the shaken pet on its Twitter page with the comment 'scared, but this little pup survived.'

But today, they learned the brave little guy was actually guarding his deceased owner whose body was recovered beneath the rubble that was presumably once their home.

The deputies took to Facebook to give the back story on the pup at around 5pm local time, and the photo has had almost 3,500 likes on the social-networking site. 

'The dog was taken to a shelter and the deputy who found the pup, if possible, plans on adopting the dog,' the OCSO tweeted on Tuesday. 'Man's best friend to the end.'

The news comes after survivors frantically try to reunite with their pets, displaced after the monstrous tornado.

Overjoyed: Both pet and owner were delighted when he emerged from the wreckage

Reddit users have established a missing pets thread and local business OKC Pups is also attempting to connect lost pets with owners.

One success story is that of Barbara Garcia who found her lost dog beneath the rubble during a TV interview and their heartwarming reunion is bringing the internet to tears.

As the Moore resident was speaking to CBS about the devastation the tornado had wrought on her town, her little pet emerged from the rubble of her home.

Ms Garcia, who was clearly overcome with emotion, immediately declared God had answered her prayers.

Another happy story involves the Hendrinks family, who were still missing two members of their household after the tornado flatted their Moore home on Monday: their pair of chihuahuas.

The family's two other dogs were found under a pile of debris in the backyard but the Chihuahuas, Lola and Louie, were nowhere to be found until Tuesday morning, when owner Levi heard the faint sound of dogs whining under what used to be their home.

'That's how we pinpointed where they were at and started digging at that point,' Hendricks told NBC News.

'Their kennel was smashed down on top of them. The car was sitting on top of the kennel. We had to pry the kennel out from underneath the car and then pry the kennel apart to get them out.'

Levi Hendricks and his two sons started digging and before too long the cute pets were free, and pretty happy about it.

'They were both wrapped around each other and inside a comforter. They were toasty warm,' he said. 'And both of them were just tickled to death to get out.'
