A young Sydney woman who could face the death penalty after being charged by Chinese authorities for allegedly attempting to smuggle the drug ‘ice’ from China was reported missing by a worried family member last month.

It emerged overnight that Kalynda Davis, a talented  basketballer in her early 20s from the Penrith region in Sydney’s west, and Peter Gardner, 25, from Richmond, will face a Chinese court this week accused of trying to smuggle 75kg of methamphetamine to Australia.

Friends have taken to Facebook to lament the pair's desperate situation. 

‘Kalyndra was an amazing girl she just got herself into the wrong crowd,’ said a former colleague of the blonde. ‘I honestly hope they don’t give her the death penalty though.’

Mates of Gardner described him as a good man and wondered how it got to this point. Brad King told Daily Mail Australia: 'He was actually a really genuine bloke who would do anything for his mates.'

Another friend said: 'He was doing so so well for himself as well, and now this!'

Daily Mail Australia understands the pair had only known each other for only a matter of weeks before they flew from Sydney International Airport to Guangzhou on November 5. 

That same day, both Davis and Gardner were reported missing to police. 

The muscular, blonde-haired Gardner, who recently worked for a construction company in Kurmond in Sydney's greater west, was last spotted in Australia that day near his home in Richmond.  

The pair  booked their seats on the plane at the Flight Centre at a nearby shopping centre, Nine News reported.

Three days after the pair arrived in Guangzhou, Davis and Gardner were apprehended by Chinese authorities at the airport, the broadcaster said.

A New South Wales police spokeswoman said the matter was referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as soon as Davis was located overseas.   

Australia is currently in the grip of an ice crisis, with use of the drug more than doubling from 21 per cent in 2010 to 50 per cent of drug users in 2013, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

A number of Australians have been detained overseas on drug charges in recent times, most famously including Schapelle Corby, who served nine years in an Indonesian prison. 

Some have been put to death, including Vietnamese Australian Van Tuong Nguyen, who was hung for drug trafficking on December 2, 2005. 

The blonde-haired, blue-eyed Davis has many friends in Sydney's west. She is understood to occasionally visit music festivals.

Sources said she regularly played basketball in Penrith. In an old posting on a social media profile when she younger, Davis said 'bball [basketball] is my life.'

Mr Gardner's former employer Michael Kulakovski told the Nine Network he was deeply concerned for the young man's future.

'To be caught with substance in China is probably one of the worst countries to be caught in,' Mr Kulakovski said.  

'He was doing really good, he had a lot of work and he was earning good money. (I) don't know why he's done this.'

Mr Kulakovski did not return Daily Mail Australia's calls.  The Department of Foreign Affairs refused to comment when approached on Wednesday morning.

Davis and Gardner's case are expected to be heard by a Chinese court later this week.
