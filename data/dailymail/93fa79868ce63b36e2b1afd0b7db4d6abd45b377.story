Police discovered the boy in a cupboard at the home of registered sex offender Adam Younger (pictured)

A young boy was found hiding in a locked cupboard at a paedophile’s home.

Police discovered the 12-year-old during a routine visit to the home of registered sex offender, Adam Younger.

Durham Crown Court heard that Younger, then 22, was being monitored as a three-times sex offender.

It was under the terms of that order that the officer visited the house in Horden, County Durham, on December 29.

Mark Styles, prosecuting, said when Younger answered the door he was only partially dressed.

The officer decided to check the rest of the premises, during which she went into a bedroom with unmade bedding and a cupboard locked by a latch from the outside.

Mr Styles said: 'On opening it, she found a 12-year-old boy hiding inside.

'He was coaxed out and assured he wasn’t in trouble.'

Younger fled, later sending text messages back to the boy, telling him: 'Run', and, 'Say you have only been for ten minutes.'

Later that day, Younger was arrested outside his grandmother’s house in Sunderland.

He told police that he had befriended the boy at a bus station.

Mr Styles said the boy, who was considered vulnerable, appeared to have stayed there for much of the Christmas holiday, with Younger, 'playing off one person in responsibility against another'.

When the boy’s mother came seeking him, Younger played out 'a charade' pretending to be the elder brother of her son’s schoolfriend, who was on an errand.

Younger, now 23, admitted child abduction and two charges of breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

Two of his previous offences were for sexual assaults on boys aged under 13 and the third was for downloading indecent images of mainly young boys, for which he received a 21-month custodial sentence at Teesside Crown Court, in January 2009.

As part of that sentence, Younger was also made subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (Sopo) limiting his future contact with boys.

Warren Grier, mitigating, said: 'Clearly the defendant knows there’s only one outcome.

'It’s a custodial sentence and he needs assistance from a sex treatment programme while he’s serving that sentence.'

Jailing him for three years, Recorder Ian Atherton told Younger it would appear he was 'grooming' the 12-year-old, using deceit to convince the boy’s mother it was all above board.
