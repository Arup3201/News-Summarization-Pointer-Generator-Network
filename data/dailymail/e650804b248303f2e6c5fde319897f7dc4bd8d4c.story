A former bouncer has lost more than 20st in weight - but gained rolls of sagging flesh which now cascade down his body.

Marius Stoicas, from Bucharest, still tips the scales at over 15st - but says that is a 'dream weight' compared to his previous size. He was so large that it cost him his job as a bodyguard.

Aged 34, when he was at his heaviest - an astonishing 35st 7lb - he could not dress himself 
or tie his own shoe laces.

Marius Stoicas weighed an astonishing 35st before he lost weight and was unable to even tie his own shoes

Marius's 21st stone weight loss has left him with massive folds of excess skin, gaining him the nick name of 'Shar Pei man' in his hometown

He said: ‘Sometimes I'd get work as a bouncer, and all I needed to do was stand in the doorway to keep people out, they couldn't budge me.’

But the former bouncer said that in the end he knew it was diet or die.

However, since losing weight, Marius, from the Romanian capital Bucharest, now feels ‘a different man’.

Although it is hard for him to look in the mirror because of his skin hanging loose, he said he still owes 'everything' to the doctor who helped to get him on the diet.

Now he will need a further operation to remove the masses of hanging skin which so torment him.

Plastic surgeon Cristian Radu Jecan (L) says he is already planning the skin operation, but Marius is still trying to raise the £4,000 needed for the operation

‘I was reborn. From 500lbs to 190lbs (35st 7lb to 13st 7lb). I could not run, I needed help to put my shoes on’, Marius said.

‘But I will have to scrape together 5,000 Euro (£4,000) before I can have the skin removed.’

Plastic surgeon Cristian Radu Jecan says he is already planning the skin operation.

‘At a rough estimate, we will remove 8-10lbs of tissue and a skin surface of three square feet, given that the entire surface of the body is 20-25 square feet for an adult of average weight and height. That is 10-20 per cent of the total area,’ the doctor said.

‘Because it is a very delicate surgery, there are risks,’ he added, saying it needed to be done carefully.
