Kevin Pietersen has paved the way for a summer of potential embarrassment for the ECB after agreeing to rejoin Surrey in an improbable bid to regain his Test place.

Pietersen will be available for the county across all three formats but will focus on the four-day Championship as he attempts to force his way back into the England team following his sacking a year ago. Confirmation of his Surrey return is expected on Thursday.

Another remarkable news cycle for the English game began with Pietersen telling Test Match Special listeners he would do ‘anything’ to play international cricket again.

29 - Pietersen’s average in the 5-0 Ashes drubbing in 2013-14, the last series he played. That is well below his Test average of 47.

20 - months since he last played a first-class match for Surrey

19 - months since his last century in any form of the game, 113 against Australia at Old Trafford

39 - his highest score in the T20 Blast for Surrey last season. In 12 innings, he averaged 22

That comment prompted English cricket’s beleaguered powerbrokers to close ranks once more. Going into a summer in which England desperately need to reconnect with their fans and regain the Ashes, the ECB fear Pietersen will act as a non-stop, hard-to-silence distraction.

Test captain Alastair Cook, in Abu Dhabi for the season’s curtain-raiser on Sunday between MCC and Yorkshire, was quick out of the blocks. ‘There’s been a hell of a lot of stuff happened with his book,’ he said, ‘so he is unlikely to come back into the team.’

England selector James Whitaker, who would have preferred to focus on Wednesday’s announcement of the Test squad for the Caribbean, told Sky Sports: ‘We haven’t had discussions at all about Kevin. This last 12 months we’ve been successfully rebuilding the Test team and he’s not part of our plans.

‘We’ve produced some good middle-order players with Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Ian Bell continuing to perform well, so we are happy with where we are in the middle order.’ 

Pietersen has hinted he could change his IPL contract in a bid to push for an England place

Both Whitaker and ECB managing director Paul Downton — the man behind last year’s controversial sacking — have repeatedly insisted Pietersen will never play for England again, a fate that appeared to have been sealed by the publication in October of his score-settling autobiography.

But Pietersen, desperate to add his England-record tally of 13,797 runs and 32 centuries, seized on a stray comment made this month by new ECB chairman Colin Graves, who said the ‘first thing he has to do if he wants to get back is start playing county cricket’.

But Graves was simply stating the obvious: affiliation to a county is the minimum requirement for anyone with England hopes.

But, emboldened by what he regarded as the first stage of a peace offering, Pietersen took every opportunity to state his desire to play for England once more.

Surrey were initially wary of resuming ties with a cricketer who turns 35 in June but Pietersen has often been at his best when he has had a point to prove. And the prospect of a hatful of Division Two runs as Surrey push for promotion prompted director of cricket Alec Stewart to bring him into a middle order alongside Sri Lankan veteran Kumar Sangakkara.

County bowlers may not agree, but the move is a smart one. As long as Whitaker, Downton, coach Peter Moores and Cook remain in situ, it is inconceivable that Pietersen can resume his international career. But assuming he manages to extricate himself from his £200,000 IPL deal with Sunrisers Hyderabad, as well as a contract with St Lucia Zouks in the Caribbean Premier League, that means he could be available for most, if not all, of the county season.

The nightmare scenario for the ECB officials who have stated their position so unequivocally is a glut of runs for the man they continue to consider persona non grata. 

Kumar Sangakkara appeared to confirm Pietersen's return to Surrey this season after Sri Lanka bowed out of the World Cup with a convincing defeat by South Africa

The call from his many fans on social media for Pietersen’s return would grow — especially if England fail to put a disastrous World Cup behind them as they embark on an absurd programme of 17 Tests in 10 months.

On Wednesday Pietersen told TMS: ‘If I can do anything that can help me get back into it for England then it’s something I want to do. I love playing for England.’

His best hope is the sacking of all the men who object to him — and for that to happen England would need to perform terribly in the Ashes. In other words, the only plausible scenario that can rescue Pietersen is one he cannot be seen to hope for.

Not for the first time, English cricket and Kevin Pietersen find themselves engaged in a tense Catch-22.
