A British killer road racer who has been hiding in Australia for two years has been deported back to the UK after being arrested for speeding Down Under.

Marcus Barney, 27, who describes himself as a Romany gypsy and a 'habitual street racer', has been wanted in Britain to serve out the remaining 450 days of a seven-year sentence imposed in May 2007 for causing death by dangerous driving.

He was given day release from Sudbury Prison in August 2009 - and failed to return.

Instead, he fled to Australia, using a false Irish passport in the name of Alan Tony Harte to pass through immigration control in February 2010.

Then, while in Australia, he used several aliases to travel around New South Wales and Queensland, Australian newspapers reported.

He also became married while in the country.

Jailed: Bradley Barney pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at an accident and sentenced to eight years

He was arrested and jailed in Britain 
after he drove his green Peugeot sedan along a country road in 
Oxfordshire, known locally as the '13 bends of death', racing his 
brother Bradley who was in a silver Volkswagen Passat.

Bride-to-be Carol Tegg, 26, skidded to avoid the brothers' cars and she died when her Citroen Saxo crashed into a bus and burst into flames.

Barney, of Hinckley, Leicestershire, 
and his brother Bradley Barney each pleaded guilty to causing death by 
dangerous driving and failing to stop at an accident.

His
false names kept him at arms length from the law in Australia, but on 
July 7 last year he was pulled over for speeding and it was found that 
he had stolen goods in his car.

It
was not until he was fingerprinted by police in the town of Kempsey, in
northern New South Wales, and the results were run through the Interpol
database that his true identity was revealed.

In
October last year the British government began the legal process of 
extradition but Mr Barney said he would contest it. Later, however, he 
withdrew his plans to fight the move.

Australian sources said he had now been deported back to Britain.
