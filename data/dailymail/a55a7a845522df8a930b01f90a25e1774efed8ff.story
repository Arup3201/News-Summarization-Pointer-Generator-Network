A firefighter who was dressed in a bear costume at a carnival was badly injured when he was run over by his own colleagues.

Justin Matthews, a retained firefighter from Torrington, Devon, was walking in front of the vehicle during the town's carnival when he was hit by its front wheel.

Mr Matthews, who is the landlord at the Cavalier Inn in Well Street in Torrington, was dressed in a bear costume at the time.

The firefighters foot became trapped under the front offside wheel. He is believed to have broken the tibia in his left leg

The incident happened as the carnival was making its way around the roundabout next to Torrington Cottage Hospital at the top of Calf Street at around 7pm on Saturday night.

The procession was stopped while ambulances treated the firefighter, who has broken his tibia, at the scene.

Ellen Vernon, who lives in Torrington, said the crowd was horrified as everyone realised what had happened.

'I was sat on the roundabout as he came around the corner,' she said. 'The fire engine had several people walking in front of it.

'There was a guy on stilts or in some tall costume and another dressed as a bear.

'The fire engine was turning very slowly around the roundabout to back up towards Calf Street.

'As it turned, the bear was walking on the inside of the roundabout and it appears the front wheel caught him.

'The bloke who had been hit starting screaming "back up, back up". Because he had the bear head on I think he had not seen or heard the fire engine.

'It was a scene of horror. There were lots of families and children thinking 'oh my god' when they realised what had happened.

'A lady ran out from the crowd who was medical in some form or another and helped. The carnival was stopped for half an hour or so while the ambulance crew gave him oxygen.'

Mr Matthews was taken to North Devon District Hospital but came home again later that evening.

Graham Rooke, from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'It was a low-speed incident. He was wearing a bear suit and walking in front of the fire engine.

'His foot became trapped under the front offside wheel.

'He has broken his tibia in his left leg and his foot is swollen but other than that we don't think there are any other injuries. It just shows accidents can happen to anyone - even the emergency services aren't immune.

'A full investigation will now be undertaken to determine what the cause was and to stop it happening again.'

No disciplinary action is expected to be taken against the driver, who is also a retained firefighter.
