This is the terrifying moment a huge great white shark attacked a boat carrying four men and started chewing on the outboard motor.

The fishing vessel was travelling about two miles off the coast of Pottsville in the Australian state of New South Wales, when the shark started circling.

Although it launched an attack on the boat minutes later, the fishermen were not fazed, laughing as they grabbed a camera to film themselves feeding the 16 foot monster a tin of tuna, before slapping it and sending it on its way.

Terrifying: A boat carrying four fishermen was attacked by a 16 foot great white shark near Pottsville in northern Australia. The huge creature swam among dolphins while circling the boat before trying to attack its outboard motor (pictured) and bait box

Prowl: The fishing vessel was travelling about two miles off the coast of Pottsville in the Australian state of New South Wales, when the shark started circling

Fear: The fishermen originally thought the large shadow beneath the water was one of the dolphins they had spotted in the area minutes earlier. Reality struck, however, when the great white got closer to the surface and its tell-tale fin started protruding from the water

Stalking: The fishermen switched off their engine after the great white attacked the boat, which appeared to calm it down. The shark followed the boat as it drifted along for about two hours, giving the men time to take photographs and film themselves feeding it tins of tuna

Not scared: Although it launched an attack on the boat, the fishermen were not phased, laughing as they grabbed a camera to film themselves feeding the 16 foot monster a tin of tuna, before slapping it and sending it on its way

The fishermen originally thought the large shadow beneath the water was one of the dolphins they had spotted in the area minutes earlier.

Reality struck, however, when the great white got closer to the surface and its tell-tale fin started protruding from the water.

'I saw one with a massive fin and said 'that’s not a dolphin', then he came up to the back of the boat and started having a go at the transducer and bait board,' fisherman Daniel Flemming told Australia's Nine Network news channel.

'When it first came up it was a bit daunting, it was a shark the same size as the boat and it pushed the boat around a couple of times,' he added. 

Confusion: Fisherman Daniel Flemming thought the massive great white shark may have been a dolphin at first. He realised he had made a mistake when the creature started attacking the outboard motor and bait board

Visitors: Once the fishermen turned off their engines the shark calmed down and followed them as they drifted. The fishermen even called other boats in the area to the scene (pictured) so they could also enjoy the once-in-a-lifetime spectacle

Risk: The great white appeared so content that the men even started teasing the wild animal by putting their hands in the water, as they were confident it wasn't going to attack them again

The fishermen switched off their engine after the great white attacked the boat, which appeared to calm it down.

The shark followed the boat as it drifted along for about two hours, giving the men time to take photographs and film themselves feeding it tins of tuna.

They even called other fishing boats in the area to the scene so that they too could enjoy the once-in-a-lifetime spectacle.

Goodbye: Deciding they had had enough of its company, fisherman James Tate eventually slapped the shark on the nose, scaring it off. The men estimated it to be about 16 foot long - the same length as their boat

Damage: Although the shark was calm for much of the time it spent following the fishing boat, the consequences of its attack on the outboard motor were clear to see

Speaking to Australia's Nine Network news channel later, fisherman Daniel Flemming (pictured) said: 'I saw one with a massive fin and said 'that¿s not a dolphin', then he came up to the back of the boat and started having a go at the transducer and bait board'

Perhaps unsurprisingly the shark started nudging the boat shortly after, and began trying to attack the bait box the fishermen were carrying onboard.

Deciding they had had enough of its company, fisherman James Tate then slapped it on the nose, scaring it off.

The men estimated the shark to be about 16 foot long - bigger than their boat.

Last week a monster female great white who is so notorious she has been nicknamed Joan of Shark forced the closure of a popular beach in Albany, Western Australia.

The largest great white ever tagged in Australia, Joan is more than 16 foot long, weighs around 1.6 tonnes and is believed to have made more than a dozen appearances in the last month.
