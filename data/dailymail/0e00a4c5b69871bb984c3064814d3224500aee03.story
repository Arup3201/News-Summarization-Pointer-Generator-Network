A highway department worker who rescued his girlfriend's cat which was stuck up a tree has been sacked after using his town's bucket truck to save the pet.

Jim Mackie, the highway superintendent of Phillipston, Massachusetts went to the aid of Jackie Prime, whose ginger cat Kaboodle, was stranded at the top of a tree in her backyard in nearby Westminster in May.

Ms Prime had called the town's fire department and several tree companies but they were unable to help free Kaboodle.

At a last resort she called Mr Mackie, who used a town of Phillipston fire truck to bring down the cat, who scampered up the tree during a storm.

But during the rescue, the truck became stuck in the muddy garden and Mr Mackie summoned another highway worker in a dump truck to free the vehicle.

A complaint was then filed against Mr Mackie for using Phillipston town equipment in Westminster on non-official business.

He was suspended on two week’s pay and was effectively fired after the Board of Selectmen chose not to re-appoint him as highway superintendent.

Mr Mackie told CBS Boston: 'I was just trying to help her out — period. Nothing more. Nothing less. I would have done the same thing for any Phillipston employee.'

Ms Prime says she only called her friend after becoming exasperated after nobody would help rescue her pet and can't believe it cost him his job.

She added: 'I reached out to a friend. I never thought it would cost him his job.

'I just can’t believe they would derail a man’s life over something like this. If this is just about a cat then the punishment doesn’t fit the crime.'

Mr Mackie has now consulted a lawyer after losing his job, which he says he wants to get back.

The Board of Selectmen refused to comment on the case.
