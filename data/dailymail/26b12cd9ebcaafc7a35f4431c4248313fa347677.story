A prisoner has been filmed escaping from jail by climbing through a window and running past police.

Derrick Estell, an alleged armed robber and car thief, apparently roped in two accomplices to aid his escape from the county jail in Hot Springs, Arkansas.

The 33-year-old is now at the centre of a police manhunt after his bizarre breakout, which was captured on surveillance video from inside the jail.

Escape: Derrick Estell was caught on camera escaping from jail in Hot Springs, Arkansas

Coming through: Estell leaped through a service window while police were busy talking to an alleged accomplice

Suspect: Estell has been charged with stealing a car and participating in an armed robbery

Estell escaped from Garland County Jail on Sunday afternoon after he had been using the facility's telephone.

He was being watched over from a service window by two police officers while talking on the phone provided for the use of inmates.

When the two deputies were distracted by William Harding, an alleged accomplice, Estell suddenly jumped up and leaped through the window.

He then ran out of the jail's door into the parking lot and to an alleyway, where he climbed into a waiting car.

Incoming! The alleged armed robber was able to escape as the police on guard were looking the other way

Scramble: Estell is considered to be armed and dangerous, according to police who are looking for him

Breakout: Police were unable to stop him leaving but did arrest his alleged accomplice at the scene

Officers tried to stop the car from pulling away, but failed to do so.

The car was found abandoned just a few minutes later, and there was no sign of either Estell or his alleged getaway driver Tamara Upshaw

Harding was arrested for allegedly helping Estell escape, while the prisoner and Upshaw are currently being sought by police.

Officials believe that other people were involved in the escape plan, and are currently trying to track them down.

Running off: Estell made it into the jail's parking lot and started running towards his getaway car

Uncatchable: Estell was driven away from the scene in a car which was soon abandoned nearby

Pursuit: Police ran after him and attempted to retrieve him from the car but failed to do so

Estell is considered to be armed and dangerous, while police have warned that he has a 'violent history'.

He has been in prison since March, when he allegedly stole a truck and went on the run, leading to a stand-off with a SWAT team.

He was charged with robbery, burglary, breaking and entering and other offences, and was also on parole from a conviction dating back to 2010.
