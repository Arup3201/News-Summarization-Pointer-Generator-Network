Chris Froome will return to cycling in Spain this weekend after being forced to abandon the Tour de France last month.

The 2013 Tour de France winner leads a nine-man Team Sky line-up featuring fellow Brits Peter Kennaugh and Luke Rowe at the Vuelta a Espana.

Froome, 29, was forced to abandon his Tour de France title defence on stage five because of a fractured wrist.

'This is exactly the sort of challenge that I need after the disappointment of withdrawing from the Tour de France,' Froome said after his Vuelta a Espana participation was confirmed.

'You can't dwell on disappointment, you have to move on quickly to the next thing and the Vuelta has become the perfect race for me to focus on.

'I'm really pleased with how my recovery has gone since the Tour, I've been training hard and the support team are pleased with my progress.'

Meanwhile, Mark Cavendish will not take part in the race either despite returning to racing last week.

The 29-year-old Manxman had been included in a long-list of potential participants by organisers of the Spanish Grand Tour, but was not in the final nine-man Omega Pharma-Quick Step squad released on Monday.

Cavendish, who was hurt in a crash on the opening stage of the Tour, returned to action in last week’s Tour de l’Ain but is not yet in the sort of shape needed for a three-week Grand Tour.

Without him, Omega Pharma-Quick Step will focus on helping former Team Sky rider Rigoberto Uran challenge the likes of Chris Froome, Alberto Contador and Nairo Quintana in the general classification of the Vuelta, which starts on August 23.
