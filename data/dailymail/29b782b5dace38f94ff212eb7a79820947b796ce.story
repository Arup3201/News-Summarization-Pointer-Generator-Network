A rare Ferrari has become the second most expensive car sold at auction in Britain after it fetched a whopping £10.75 million.

The Ferrari 375-Plus was the Italians’ ultimate weapon in the 1954 World Sportscar Championship.

Just five were ever made and this model competed at Le Mans, Silverstone and the Mille Miglia races.

This Ferrari is now the second most expensive car sold at auction in Britain after it fetched £10.75 million on Friday

The now record breaking and extremely expensive Ferrari pictured at break-neck speed on the track at Mille Miglia in 1954 - it was later stolen while in storage

But in 1986 a trailer containing the Ferrari, which was missing some major parts and the engine, was stolen, kicking off a 25-year tale involving the FBI, Interpol and, most recently, lawyers.

After years of legal wrangling, the car was put up at auction at Bonham’s Goodwood Festival of Speed auction on Friday.

The car, offered without a reserve, was the star lot with collectors from around the world registering their interest in it.

Bidding started at £2 million and quickly increased as potential buyers battled it out in the auction room.

The Ferrari was the Italians' ultimate weapon in the 1954 World Sportscar Championship, with only five models ever made - four for the track and one for the road

The Ferrari was capable of doing 0-60mph in just four seconds and 60 years ago could hit a top speed of 186mph - it was used to devastating effect on the track

Offers were soon going up in £250,000 increments with the hammer eventually going down at £9.6 million with applause around the auction room.

With a buyers premium and VAT, the new owner ended up paying a massive £10.75 million.

This topped the £5 million paid for a road car in public in Britain, when an American bought a Bentley Blower at the same auction in 2012.

It is now the third most expensive car ever sold at auction and the second most expensive in Britain.

It follows the massive £19 million paid for a classic Formula 1 Mercedes-Benz in July last year, which also set a world record. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 was the race car driven by five-time F1 world champion Juan Manuel Fangio when he clinched his second title in 1954.

The sale is the latest chapter in an incredible history for the 1954 Ferrari 375 Plus, which was the fastest road car of its day.

Under the bonnet was a 4.9-litre which developed a staggering 330bhp.

The Ferrari was capable of 0-60mph in just four seconds and could hit a top speed of 186mph - 60 years ago.

But in 1957, the car was damaged by fire and sold by its owner to a nuclear physicist called Karl Kleve.

The scientist kept the car in his massive collection in Ohio but in 1986 a trailer containing the Ferrari was stolen.

The thieves, who were later jailed, sold the car to a broker in Atlanta who, in 1989, sold the car to Belgian racing driver Jacques Swaters.

Mr Swaters, a close friend of Enzo Ferrari, was initially unaware the Ferrari had been stolen and had it restored in Modena, Italy.

Despite the theft and recovery, the Ferrari was never returned to Mr Kleve and there were years of legal battles on each side of the Atlantic.

Bonhams helped to resolve the dispute, which resulted in the Ferrari being sold at auction for the record figure.

The car was sold with a spare period works block engine and its original body panels, still bearing traces of the 1957 Cuban Grand Prix race colours.
