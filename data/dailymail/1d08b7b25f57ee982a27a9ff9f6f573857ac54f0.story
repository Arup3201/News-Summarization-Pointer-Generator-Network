A heart-warming video that shows homeless people in Los Angeles receiving incredible makeovers has emerged online.

The black and white clip features a series of homeless men sat outside under a canopy  before and after voluntary barbers cut their hair and shave their beards.

The resulting reactions from the men are moving – one cradles his hands with a smile while another, seemingly lost for words after looking at himself in the mirror, hugs the barber appreciatively. 

The video – the brainchild of filmmaker Tyler Bridges – is in an attempt to challenge certain misconceptions regarding homelessness, and proves that the people featured are no different to anyone else.

It also highlights the shocking statistic that there are currently over 600,000 people experiencing homelessness in the United States.

The campaigning video states that it is not the differences in our age, wealth, ability or social standing that defines us as we are all the same inside.

Wonderful gesture: Volunteering barbers cut the hair of a number of homeless people from the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles

The moving footage was taken at the Union Rescue Mission and concludes by calling for its viewers to get involved with their local shelter or mission.

The kind gesture follows the recent installation of a state-of-the-art salon service opened by the Pope at the Vatican, where homeless people are invited to go to get a shave or their hair cut for free. 

Before and after: The homeless man enjoys his new look and is featured clasping his hands and smiling appreciatively in the video

A new man: Another happy man receives a hair cut and shave and is visibly  appreciative of his new look in the video
