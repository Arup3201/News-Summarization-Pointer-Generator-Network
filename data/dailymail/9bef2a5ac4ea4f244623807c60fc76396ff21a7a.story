Radamel Falcao hopes that Manchester United sign him permanently at the end of his £6million loan, saying that he wants to ‘stay many years and make history’ at Old Trafford.

The Colombia striker was unveiled alongside £14million midfielder Daley Blind on Thursday after taking part in his first training session with Louis van Gaal’s team. United have the option to buy Falcao from Monaco next summer in a deal worth a total of £52million after agreeing to pay the 28-year-old £280,000-a-week this season.

Speaking in a combination of English and Spanish, Falcao said: ‘I hope to stay many years in Manchester United and make history at this club. When I was at FC Porto and Atletico Madrid I always wanted to improve and I dreamed about playing in a team like this. Now I want to stay here for many years.

‘It’s a new process and a new team. This year some players have come and Manchester United are building a big team this season and future seasons. I would like to be here and be part of the project.

‘I am very happy to be here. It’s a big challenge for me for my career. I always dreamed to be in a club like Manchester United.’ 

Falcao has made six appearances and scored two goals for club and country since rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee playing for Monaco in a French Cup tie in January, but has yet to complete a full game.

His brief appearance for Colombia as a substitute against Brazil in Miami on Friday took his total playing time to 217 minutes – an average of 38 minutes per game – but he insists that he is fully recovered. 

‘Yes I feel well,’ he added. ‘I started to play two months ago with Monaco and I have improved in the last month a lot. I scored goals, and that is important to strikers. I’m confident with my physical form and I’m comfortable with my knee. I feel good in myself and happy to be here.’

Questions have been raised about how Louis van Gaal can fit Falcao, other new signing Angel Di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata into the same team, but the Colombian is confident that United can make it work as he prepares for a debut at home to QPR on Sunday.

He said: ‘When you’re talking about settling in, when you’re talking about top-quality players it makes settling in more easy.

‘I think I will need not much time because Manchester United has very good players and it’s easier to play football. I’m used to life in cities like this. I don’t think I will have a problem adapting.

‘I see the club in a period of everyone needing to get to know one another. But they are top-quality players and very intelligent players who can apply what the coach has in mind for us on the field quickly.

‘In terms of where I play, that is something the manager will have to decide for me.

‘I’ve been fortunate to play at some big clubs all over the world in big games and finals. I would rather focus on enjoying my football and making the most of the opportunity United have given me.

I tend to set myself personal targets and goals, and that’s how players challenge themselves.’

Falcao was reluctant to talk about the other clubs linked with him this summer, including Real Madrid, Manchester City and Arsenal , but admitted that not playing in the Champions League for a fifth consecutive season is a blow.

‘It’s true, every player wants to play in the Champions League,’ he said. ‘This year it’s not possible in Manchester but we are confident that we will qualify next season.

‘I don’t want to talk about other teams. I can say that I’m very happy here and believe in this project. United are the best club for my style of play, and I am sure it will be a great period for us in the future.’
