While most head chefs take a decade refining their culinary skills, Andrew Duff has scaled the career ladder faster than most and become Scotland's youngest head chef - at the tender age of 16.

Andrew, who has been cooking since he was 12, has wowed diners since taking over the kitchen at an Edinburgh gastropub earlier this month.

The culinary whizzkid now has dreams of owning his own restaurant - and becoming the youngest person to be awarded a Michelin star.

Sixteen-year-old Andrew Duff is now  the youngest head chef in Britain, working at Mackenzie's Bar in the Davidson's Mains area of Edinburgh

Andrew has always enjoyed dabbling in the kitchen, first baking with his father as a child before making his first meal at the age of 12

He said: 'I want to build up my experience and I want to be the youngest chef to get a Michelin star.

'It's a big task but once college is done I could get another job and work my way up.

'I've always wanted to own my own restaurant. I've always been a fan of Jamie Oliver. He has a restaurant in Edinburgh.

Andrew now splits his time between college in the mornings and working at the restaurant from 3-9pm

'After eating there I decided I wanted to be a chef and maybe be as big as him.'

The teenager did a one-month trial at Mackenzie's Bar in Davidson's Mains, in the north west of Edinburgh, last August before starting a professional cookery course at Edinburgh College.

When the former head chef quit earlier this month, Andrew's dad Darren suggested to owner Brian Haston and his manager wife Karen that they take the teenager on.

They agreed - and have been 'delighted' with their decision ever since.

Andrew's ambition is to own his own restaurant and be as sucessful as Jamie Oliver

Andrew has always enjoyed dabbling in the kitchen, first baking with his father as a child before making his first meal at the age of 12 - spaghetti bolognese.

He said: 'I got the opportunity to be the head chef if I wanted. The other guy left and they were looking for a new one.

'It's quite a busy restaurant. I'm only in college from 8am until 2pm then work from 3pm until 9pm during the week.

'It's quite a lot of work but in the end I think it will be worth it. It's only a pub but we serve up to 200 people at the weekend.

'I've never had any complaints about my food and all my family love my cooking.

'My lecturers say I have great inspiration and I could do well if I knuckle down and carry on with it.'

Andrew's signature dish is a chicken korma curry, which impressed his boss so much it was put on the pub's menu.

Pub manager Karen Haston said: 'His curry is totally amazing. He's very keen so I think that helps. I think for his age his cooking is really good.

'He's so laid back. We had 158 customers at the weekend and he never blinked.

'In the future he's going to be up there with the best.'

Andrew dethrones Welsh chef Luke Thomas, who emerged as Britain's youngest head chef at the age of 18 two years ago.

Luke has since opened his own bistro in the Cotswolds and starred in a BBC documentary.

Aiden Byrne, now 42, became the youngest chef to win a Michelin star when he was 22 and working at Adlards restaurant in Norwich.
