A robot which can run like a cat at speeds of up to 3mph has been developed by researchers.

Scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, have modelled their design on the animal, with springs replacing tendons and small motors used in place of the muscles.

The four-legged ‘cheetah-cub robot’ - billed by its developers as small, light and fast - is said to be the fastest of all robots its size and can run nearly seven times its body length in one second.

Design: The four-legged 'cheetah-cub robot' - billed by its developers as small, light and fast - is said to be the fastest of all robots its size and can run nearly seven times its body length in one second

Researchers said the robot’s most impressive feature is the design of its legs, which are based on those of a cat - with the number of segments and their proportions the same as on the animal.

‘We've developed it for very fast locomotion,’ researcher Alexander Sprowitz said. ‘In this case, we've mimicked a lot of the morphology of a house cat.

‘Eventually the goal is to have a robot which is easy to use - very robust, very fast and very dynamically running - kind of naturally running.

He added: ‘This morphology gives the robot the mechanical properties from which cats benefit - that’s to say a marked running ability and elasticity in the right spots, to ensure stability.’

On the ground: Researchers hope that the robot will one day be useful for search and rescue efforts in areas with difficult terrain

Auke Ijspeert, director of the Swiss institute’s Biorobotics Laboratory, said the invention is still in its experimental stages - but researchers hope it will precede other more developed devices.

‘The long-term goal of the cheetah-cub robot is to be able to develop fast, agile, ground-hugging machines for use in exploration, for example for search and rescue in natural disaster situations.

‘Studying and using the principles of the animal kingdom to develop new solutions for use in robots is the essence of our research.’
