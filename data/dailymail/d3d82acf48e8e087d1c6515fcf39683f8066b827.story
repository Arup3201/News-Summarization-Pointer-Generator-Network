Nathan Lyon spun Australia to a remarkable 48-run win over India in the first Test at Adelaide Oval.

Virat Kohli crafted a career-best century, but Lyon's maiden 10-wicket Test haul proved the difference as the hosts clinched victory on Saturday.

Michael Clarke was hobbled by a fresh hamstring injury, while India's push for a record-breaking win was halted by some howlers on a dramatic fifth day.

The enthralling battle between chief protagonists Lyon and Kohli ended in the 82nd over.

India's stand-in skipper holed out on 141, Mitch Marsh misreading the ball but completing an awkward catch in the deep.

Ryan Harris and Mitchell Johnson claimed a wicket each after the final drinks break.

But Lyon fittingly ended the game when he had Ishant Sharma stumped and India all out for 315 in the 88th over.

Lyon finished with incredible match figures of 12-286, bouncing back superbly after an underwhelming tour of the UAE, where he captured three Test wickets at an average of 140.

Michael Clarke was forced from the field with another hamstring injury on the last day of the First Test against India in Adelaide, raising doubts he will be able to play in the rest of the series.

The Australian captain went down fielding a ground ball at mid wicket after lunch and left the field clutching his right hamstring. He was assisted back to the sheds by team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris.

This latest setback continues a terrible run of injuries for Clarke, who had been in doubt of playing the first Test scheduled for Brisbane before the freak accident which caused the death of his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes.

Michael Clarke is in serious doubt for the second Test starting in Brisbane on Wednesday, after suffering another injury fielding at the Adelaide Oval today.

Clarke strained his left hamstring in a one day international in Perth last month, then suffered a recurrence of a degenerative back injury that forced him to retire hurt on 60 while batting on Tuesday. 

The 33-year-old returned the next day after extensive treatment to post a courageous 128 and has been fielding in pain during the Indians' two innings. 

Clarke was sent for scans after leaving the field today but this latest injury would appear to make it highly unlikely he will play in the second Test beginning in Brisbane on Wednesday. He may miss the rest of the series.

Australia declared its second innings closed at 5/290, with Steve Smith - who scored 162 not out in the first innings - again left unbeaten on 52. Brad Haddin was not out on 14. David Warner, who scored 145 in the first innings, knocked up 102 in the second.

The overnight declaration left India with a target of 364 for victory today. At tea, India was 2/205, with stand-in captain Virat Kohli on 82 (off 112 balls) and Murali Vijay on 85 (off 208).

Earlier, Mitchell Johnson had Shikhar Dhawan caught by Brad Haddin for 21, while Haddin also caught Cheteshwar Pujara off Nathan Lyon for 21. 

The Brisbane Test was delayed after the death of former Test opener Phillip Hughes, who was struck in the neck by a bouncer playing for South Australia against NSW on November 25. He died two days later.
