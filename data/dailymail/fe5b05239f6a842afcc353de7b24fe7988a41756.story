It wasn't the return he was hoping for, but that didn't stop Mario Balotelli sharing pleasantries with his former Manchester City team-mates.

The 24-year-old was caught on camera hugging Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy as the pair gave him a warm welcome back inside the Etihad Stadium tunnel.

Zabaleta looked especially pleased to see the Italy forward - embracing his friend on his return to England.

Despite the niceties, Liverpool's new £16million signing was afforded no favours from the duo as he watched his new side slump to a 3-1 defeat on Monday night.

Two goals from Stevan Jovetic and a Sergio Aguero strike gave the Premier League champions a 3-0 lead before Rickie Lambert scored a late consolation for the visitors.

Jovetic's double earned him the man-of-the-match award and the Montenegrin looked rather chuffed with his performance as he walked back into the tunnel after full-time.

The same couldn't be said for Frank Lampard though, who looked frustrated before kick-off as the former Chelsea star was again excluded from the matchday squad.
