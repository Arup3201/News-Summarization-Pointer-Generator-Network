It was arguably the hottest sporting ticket of all time.

And Britain’s high society stalwarts didn’t disappoint as they begged, borrowed and charmed their way into Centre Court yesterday to watch Andy Murray’s quest for glory.

There was a prime minister, a former England football captain and even a Time Lord. But it was, perhaps inevitably, the impeccably dressed Middleton sisters who stole the show.

Side by side, with their glossy brunette blow-dries styled to perfection, they were greeted with wolf whistles and cheers as they entered the Royal Box.

It's all over now: Pippa Middleton and her sister the Duchess of Cambridge salute Roger Federer and Andy Murray during the trophy presentation

The Duchess of Cambridge waved excitedly to fans as she and her 28-year-old sister took their front-row seats.

Kate looked as impossibly chic as 
ever in a cream Joseph ensemble of the £480 ‘Nessie’ tweed jacket, which
 debuted last year at the Epsom Derby, and a £275 crepe shift ‘Vanessa’ 
dress which she bought for last summer’s North American tour.

Pippa, ever the more fashion-forward,
 went for a Project D £350 ‘Phoebe’ frock decorated with bluebirds and 
designed by Dannii Minogue and Tabitha Somerset Webb and shoes by Jaeger.

Big fashion ticks for both the peplum
 style and the on-trend print. But more importantly, and most 
engagingly, as keen tennis fans they seemed delighted at being able to 
watch such a nail-biting match live.

Looking good: Come on Andy! The Middleton sisters look confident - and delighted at their front row seats

He'll do it: Both now wearing sunglasses, Kate and Pippa are clearly being dazzled by Murray's feisty play, or perhaps it was a rare spell of sunshine?

He will do it... won't he? Pippa's seeming a bit concerned, but her sister appears to have comforting words

That was close! The Duchess tensely clasps her hands but Pippa's smile suggests the action, on this occasion, went Murray's way

Even when some wag yelled from the 
crowd, ‘I love you, Pippa’, she was too engrossed to register. It was 
left to her sister to relay the information, at which both girls 
suffered an attack of the giggles.

As the dramatic match see-sawed 
towards first Murray and then Federer, they ‘ooo-ed’ and ‘aahh-ed’ with 
excitement and trepidation. Their faces mirrored the tense emotion felt 
by the whole Centre Court crowd and, when Federer finally prevailed, 
Kate, 30, clapped enthusiastically.

But even she, doe-eyes downcast in an
 attempt to control her emotions, had to bite her wobbling lip when 
Murray’s tears seemed to dissolve everyone else.

Their parents, Carole and Michael, 
were also there – in debenture seats courtesy of their friends Jane and 
Tony Henman (parents of Tim), with whom they play tennis.

Carole donned a stylish blue ensemble by Jaeger, while Michael looked smart in chinos and a blue shirt.

Meanwhile, other members of the aristocracy were putting the ‘Royal’ into the 76-seat Royal Box.
Prince Michael of Kent was there, with his indomitable wife Princess 
Pushy, in his role as President of the All-England Club and 
trophy-presenter in chief.

Lord Freddie Windsor and his actress 
wife Sophie Winkleman sprinkled some LA stardust but, along with the 
Kents, were turfed out of their normal front-row seats in favour of Kate
 and Pippa.

The political class was also well represented. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond had managed to bag one of the plum seats.

Next to him and his wife Moira was London mayor Boris Johnson (who cheered and harumped loudly) with wife Marina.

Completing the line-up was Nick 
Clegg, whose tennis-playing opponents have sometimes landed him in a 
political tight spot – whether it be David Cameron or News Corp lobbyist
 Frederic Michel.

And the Royal Box wouldn’t have been 
complete without the Prime Minister himself, who brought his mother Mary
 instead of SamCam. An avid tennis player, he joined in the ferocious 
clapping and yelling of Murray’s name.

Elsewhere in Centre Court were various celebrities from the world of sport, showbusiness and music.
Rupert Murdoch was there with his wife Wendi, as was Manchester United 
manager Alex Ferguson.Also spotted in the stands were the Beckhams, 
actor Jude Law, Dr Who star Matt Smith and Ronnie Wood and girlfriend 
Sally Humphreys.

And of course it wouldn’t have been 
Wimbledon without Sir Cliff Richard. Although not in the Royal Box this 
year, he ensured he didn’t go unnoticed thanks to his particularly 
atrocious Union Flag jacket.

Wild: Kate's leopard-print clutch bag is a Diane von Furstenburg piece, another item recycled from her North American tour wardrobe of last July

Summery: Pippa Middleton wore a bluebird print peplum dress by Project D, the label designed by Danni Minogue and Tabitha Somerset Webb

A
 Buckingham Palace spokesman also revealed the Queen had kept the 
weekend free of engagements following her recent trip to Scotland.

The spokesman said:  'The Queen keeps up to date with the news and reads the newspapers, so she's seen Murray's progress.'

However, Prince William had a prior commitment and was not in the crowd.

Ticket
 prices for the final soared with online ticket marketplace Viagogo 
saying the average ticket sale price jumped from £3-4,000 to an average
 of £5-6,000.

It was in 1938 that a Briton, Bunny 
Austin, last made it to the men’s final at Wimbledon. Eleven others have
 fallen at the semi-final stage since then, with Murray having lost in 
that round for the last three years on the trot.

The nation awaited excitedly to see if the 25-year-old Scot could be its first champion since Fred Perry in 1936, but he crashed out in four sets to Federer.

Record
 television audiences watched the Briton take on the Swiss maestro.
