Many people risk life and limb on a daily basis scrambling across pedestrian crossings before the traffic lights turn green.

But a new technology means people will have longer to cross the road if there are large crowds.

Pedestrian crossing sensors will be tested for the first time in the world in London, in a bid to make it easier and safer for people walking in the capital to cross the road.

The new technology means that traffic signal timings can be adjusted automatically so that pedestrians can cross the road for a longer period of time if they are in large crowds (illustrated)

The introduction of Pedestrian Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique, or 'Pedestrian SCOOT', is the first of its kind in the world.

The system uses video camera technology to automatically detect how many pedestrians are waiting at crossings.

It means that traffic signal timings can be adjusted automatically so that pedestrians can cross the road for a longer period of time when a large number of people are waiting.

The idea is that vast numbers of people walking in quickly in opposite directions to beat the ‘red man’ will be less likely to crash into each other mid-way across the road.

The first trials of Pedestrian SCOOT will take place outside Balham and Tooting Bec Underground stations in south west London this summer so that TfL can test the pedestrian sensors and how well they interact with other smart traffic control systems.

SCOOT systems are is already used in traffic lights, to help control traffic congestion in London as well as other cities around the world, such as Beijing.

Commenting on the SCOOT technology, Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: ‘I am delighted that London is the first city in the world to be trialling this cutting-edge equipment, which will benefit pedestrians across the city.

'This really is a fantastic example of how London is leading the way by using 21st century technology to help make it easier for people to get around our great city.

‘Innovation like this is key to keeping London moving efficiently and making our roads safer for everyone to use.’

While Pedestrian SCOOT might be slightly annoying for impatient drivers, Transport for London (TfL) has revealed that it is developing a 'call cancel' technology.

This will detect when a pedestrian who has pushed the crossing button has either crossed before the signal goes green or walks away and will therefore lets traffic continue uninterrupted.

TfL has recently rolled out ‘pedestrian countdown’ technology across 200 locations in London that tell people who long they have left to cross the road, in a bid to prevent last minute dangerous dashes.
