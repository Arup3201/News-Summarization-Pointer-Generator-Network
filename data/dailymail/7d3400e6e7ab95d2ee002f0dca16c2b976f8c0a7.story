Police in Brazil had to break up a crowd of angry dog owners after images of their pets being tortured in a grooming centre were broadcast on TV, it was reported today.

The Quatro Patas pet shop offered a wash and grooming service for dogs in Rio de Janeiro.

Many clients told how they would take their beloved pets for a pampering session every week because they believed staff at the store treated the animals so well.

Torture: The member of staff, identified as Daniel Barroso, the son of the owner, ties up a dog's snout before forcing water down its nose

But secretly recorded footage shows a worker, identified as the son of the store's owner, repeatedly punching and beating the dogs as he bathes them.

Daniel Barroso, 20, is also seen hitting the animals over the head with objects, violently banging their heads against the wall, and tying up their feet and snouts before forcing water down their noses.

The video was shot by an anonymous witness, who claims she became outraged by the daily torture of pets in the establishment.

She told Brazil's RJTV: 'The aggression and mistreatment was constant and the animals cried with pain. Some left the room injured and traumatised by the beatings.'

Horror: This moment in the video shows the young man beating friendly labrador Thor with a shampoo bottle, repeatedly hitting him over the head

In one of the most shocking scenes, a black labrador called Thor, known for being gentle, receives punches and blows for the duration of his bath.

Barroso is seen striking the five-year-old dog with a bottle of shampoo and knocking his head against the wall, even though he never reacts to the aggression.

After seeing the video, the dog's owner, Vera Fernandes, said: 'I'm absolutely horrified. I took him there every week, it was his treat.

'I never imagined something like this could ever have happened there.'

Canine nightmare: Owners of the dogs seen in the video visited Quatro Patas, which is Portuguese for Four Paws, trying to vandalise the shop

The owner of a crossbreed called Pink, 
which is seen being thrown into the bath and having water forced into 
its muzzle, cried as she said: 'I can't bear to see it. I never 
suspected anything. The owner of the shop seemed like a lovely woman.

Distraught: Vera Fernandez said she took labrador Thor to the pet shop every week as a treat

'I want justice for my dog and I'll be taking them to court.'

Police were called yesterday afternoon to the city's northern district of Engenho de Dentro after enraged owners of other dogs seen being maltreated in the video tried to smash the store's windows.

The shop's owner, Solange Barroso, insisted she had no idea about the abuse, even though she is seen at some points in the video.

She said: 'They are things that happen in one moment which I didn't have knowledge of.

'That's all I can say. I want to say a thousand sorrys because, really, I have nothing else to say.'

Authorities in Rio de Janeiro confirmed today they have temporarily suspended the pet shop's licence.

A police spokesman today said an investigation has been opened into the abuse claims.

If convicted Daniel Barroso could received a six-month jail sentence.
