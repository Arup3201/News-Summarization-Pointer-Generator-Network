The parents of conjoined twins Hope and Faith were left devastated after their suburban home was ransacked by thieves and a memorial to their dead children was trashed at the weekend. 

Dad Simon Howie said the 'sick' robbers pinched valuable household items - including a Playstation and computer hard drive - and rummaged through a pink glory box containing mementos of their dead children.

Mr Howie said the family were devastated by Saturday's incident. 

'Everyone's a bit rattled, quite shocked,' he said.

'Everything (had) sort of quietened down which was good. We were getting back a bit of normality, the kids were back in sport. 

'It's quite disheartening, really.' 

The glory box contained Hope and Faith's blue books, which recorded key events in their life, as well as their teddy bears. 

Mr Howie said his wife, Renee, was 'quite stirred up' by the incident. His teenage daughter, disturbed by the break-in, stayed at a friend's house following the attack. 

The tiny sisters were hailed as Australia's 'miracle' conjoined twins after they were born on May 8 this year weighing just over two kilograms.

The babies were born with separate brains, but they had identical faces and shared a skull and body. 

Hope and Faith tragically died after 19 days.

Mr Howie, who previously described the robbers as 'sick in the head' in a Daily Telegraph interview,  said his wife, Renee, was 'quite stirred up' by the attack.

Tiny sisters Hope and Faith were known as Australia's 'miracle' conjoined twins. They were born with the extremely rare condition known as disrosopus, which causes a baby to be born with two faces.

Police confirmed they are investigating the break-in, which occurred between 10am and 4pm. 

The family were not home at the time of the robbery.

Investigators collected fingerprints from the home on Sunday.
