A coroner has dismissed smoke from a firework display as being the cause of one of Britain’s worst motorway pile-ups - but admitted it may have been a contributing factor to poor visibility.

Seven people died and 51 were injured during the horrific crash involving 34 vehicles on the M5 near Taunton, Somerset, on November 4, 2011.

The collision happened at 8.20pm, just five minutes after a £3,000 fireworks display concluded only 200ft away at Taunton rugby club.

Britain's worst motorway pile up: West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose said smoke from a nearby firework display did not cause the crash - but it may have added to the poor visibility caused by fog

In the aftermath of the collision, motorists described driving conditions as like ‘entering a wall of thick fog’ with some likening it to having a tin of paint thrown over their windscreens.

Others said thick smog came over their vehicles like a ‘white curtain’, ‘emulsion’ or ‘custard being poured from a jug’. Other drivers have described smelling smoke or gunpowder on the motorway.

Grandparents Anthony Adams, 73, and his wife Pamela, 70, from Newport, South Wales; Michael Barton, 67, and his daughter Maggie, 30, from Windsor, Berkshire; battle re-enactor Malcolm Beacham, 46, from Woolavington, Somerset; and lorry drivers Terry Brice, 55, from South Gloucestershire, and Kye Thomas, 38, from Cornwall, all died in the crash. A further 51 others were injured.

Last year firework contractor Geoffrey Counsell, 51, who had been operating the display at the rugby club, was cleared at Bristol Crown Court of breaching health and safety laws on the night of the crash.

West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose told the inquest today: ‘I dismiss the possible cause being the smoke from the firework display itself.’

But he then added that he could not rule out the possibility that the smoke had mixed with thick fog and maybe further reduced motorists’ visibility.

He said: 'There were in the Taunton area pockets of very dense fog - in some cases of such density that only occur possibly once or maybe twice in a decade.

'Varying plumes of smoke from the firework display - particularly that caught below the inversion area - may have mixed with the fog and therefore I cannot rule out the possibility that they drifted under the inversion to the motorway and may have added to the intensity of the obscuration.'

Mr Rose said he was considering using his powers to make recommendations to ensure crashes like this did not happen again.

The coroner said he would consider whether firework operators need to be trained in the problems of running displays during fog, whether there should be a minimum distance from major roads for holding public displays, whether public displays should be licensed and whether fog detection devices should be installed on the M5 in the Taunton area.

Coroner Rose's comments were welcomed by the relatives of those killed in the crash.

Speaking after the hearing, Tonia White, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Adams, said she was pleased with Mr Rose’s conclusions.

'I think the coroner’s recommendations are a big step forward,' she said. 'That’s we were looking for - moving on and making sure this doesn’t happen to anybody else.

'We want to see the licensing of firework displays, the literature changed to include the visibility problems that have arisen.

'I think the coroner has gone as far as he could go and I think we have had our questions answered.

'As the coroner said he cannot rule out the fact the smoke didn’t play a part and that’s quite important to us. The coroner has summed it all up for us in a lot of ways.'

Her sister Elaine Adams added: 'I think the outcome today has been very, very positive and from my point of view I would like to see more legislation around fireworks, more so around operators and the way they are allowed to go and set up businesses.

'They certainly need more training and they need people who are accountable. I wouldn’t say I am 100% confident it will happen but I certainly hope that is the way it will go.'

Scene: An inquest heard how there was very dense fog in the Taunton area at the time of the crash

During the inquest, Mr Rose concluded that all of the victims died on the M5, except for Miss Barton who died later in hospital.

He
 said: ‘All the deceased were travelling in motor vehicles on the 
northbound carriageway when the vehicles entered an area of reduced 
visibility and collisions occurred as the drivers became disorientated.

‘There
 were in the Taunton area pockets of very dense fog - in some cases of 
such density that only occur possibly once or maybe twice in a decade.

‘At
 the time of the accident the pockets were generally small, save for 
areas running alongside water courses such as the River Tone, and at 8pm
 there was an area of dense fog running along a line approximately 
following the main Bristol to Taunton railway line starting about 
quarter of a mile east of Taunton station.

‘Part
 of this area of fog may have extended to the perimeters of Taunton RFC 
and, in all probability, to a height of 25ft or more to reach the 
motorway.

'This incident has been described as one of the worst motorway accidents that have occurred in Great Britain and in the town of Taunton the third most serious in the last 100 years.'

Grandparents Anthony Adams, 73 and his wife Pamela, 70, from Newport, South Wales, both died in the crash. Their daughters welcomed the coroners comments during the inquest

During the eight-day hearing, Mr Counsell said he did not consider smoke to be a danger to motorists and insisted it did not drift on to the M5 from his display.

The lorry 
driver said the build-up of smoke during the display did not give him 
any concern and there was ‘no reason whatsoever’ to consider smoke as a 
potential hazard.

‘It is not something anybody has been trained in before or told to look for,’ he said.

‘There has never been any mention of it (in literature or training courses).’

But some of the people at the display described seeing a ‘wall’ of smoke drift across the pitch towards spectators.

Others said they thought the display was too large and in the wrong place because of its proximity to the motorway.

The inquest also heard that a risk assessment Mr Counsell prepared was lost by one of the rugby club’s management committee.

Mr
 Counsell, an experienced operator, agreed with the question that if 
there was a fault that night, it was with the rules, regulations and 
guidance.

The
 inquest heard evidence from expert witnesses that none of the published
 material about firework safety warned of the dangers of smoke to road 
safety.

A coroner has dismissed smoke from a firework display at Taunton Rugby Club as being the cause of the horrific M5 crash

Fireworks operator Geoffrey Counsell, 51, was cleared of breaching health and safety laws on the night of the M5 crash.

During the trial at Bristol Crown Court last year, a judge directed a jury to find Mr Counsell not guilty of a single charge of failing to ensure the safety of others contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act.

Mr Counsell, who ran Firestorm Pyrotechnics, was the contractor hired by Taunton Rugby Club to run the £3,000 display at its ground, which was watched by 1,000 people.

He set off 1,500 shots as part of his Jupiter Display in 15 minutes - just 200 yards from the motorway.

In a leaflet promoting his business, the experienced Mr Counsell described the display as the 'biggest and most lavish' piece of 'unforgettable' pyrotechnics he offered.

Nearly a year after the horrific crash – which is one of the worst motorway pile-ups in Britain’s history – Mr Counsell of Ashill, Somerset, was charged with seven counts of manslaughter.

However, the charges were later dropped and instead he faced the health and safety charge.

In December last year, Mr Counsell was cleared of any wrongdoing after a judge said the case 'weighted heavily on hindsight'.

Judge Justice Simon, who directed the jury at Bristol Crown Court to return a verdict of not guilty, said: 'The prosecution case required Mr Counsell to appreciate and react more or less instantly to something not thought to be a hazard to anyone and had no previous reason to think it was a hazard.'

He added: 'There was no proper basis that you could have concluded that a reasonable person would have appreciated a reasonable risk and reacted to it to stop the display.'

Mr Counsell, who issued a statement outside court after being cleared, said he believed the decision to prosecute him was 'motivated by a desire to find someone to blame for this terrible accident, simply for the sake of doing so'.
