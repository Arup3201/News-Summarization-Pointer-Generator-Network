Sports brand Adidas has had to stop selling World Cup t-shirts that used sexualised stereotypes to promote host Brazil.

One t-shirt on sale on the company’s website bore the slogan ’Lookin' to Score,’ featuring a woman in a bikini in front of a Rio de Janerio beach, and the word ‘Brazil’.

Another said ‘I (heart) Brazil,’ where the heart was designed to resemble a woman’s behind wearing a thong bikini.

Pulled: The t-shirts were removed by Adidas after being slammed by both Brazil's tourism board and the country's ministry of women's affairs for being degrading to Brazilian woman and promoting sex tourism

Adidas made the announcement just hours after Brazil's tourism board released a statement condemning the merchandise.

Adidas, a World Cup sponsor and supplier of the official ball for the tournament, said in a statement the products were limited edition T-shirts available only in the United States.

‘Adidas always pays close attention to the opinion of its consumers and partners,’ the company said. ‘Therefore, it is announcing that these products will not be sold anymore.’

The T-shirts were not available on the site on Tuesday shortly after Brazilian media published images of them.

The tourism board said the Brazilian government is ‘vehemently’ against anything that ‘links Brazil's image to sex appeal,’ and said officials are working hard to repress ‘sexual tourism’ during the World Cup.

Taking a stand: Dilma Rousseff, Brazil's first female President, posted poignant tweets after the tourism board's statement, promising to fight sex tourism during the World Cup

Brazil's first woman President, Dilma Rousseff, tweeted that the nation will be doing its utmost to prevent sexual tourism during the football cup.

‘Brazil is happy to welcome the tourists that will arrive for the World Cup, but it is also ready to fight against sexual tourism,’ she said.

She was backed up by the nation's ministry of women's affairs which accused the merchandise of being offensive to Brazilian women and exposing them to 'sexual predators'.

This is all the more shocking in a country that just elected a women as its highest authority, which brought greater respect for women and zero tolerance for any form of violence against them,' a ministry statement said.

‘We want to make it very clear to our main commercial partners in tourism that Brazil does not tolerate this type of crime in its territory,’ said Flavio Dino, president of the tourism board Embratur.

‘This campaign goes against what Brazil defends. Our effort is to promote Brazil for its natural and cultural attributes.

‘An initiative like this one ignores and disrespects the message the government is trying to get across.’

‘None of our campaigns will ever use any image or message that uses sexual connotation or promotes this criminal action,’ the board said in its statement.

The World Cup is being held in Brazil from June 12 until July 13. It is the first time since 1950 the South American nation is hosting the tournament.
