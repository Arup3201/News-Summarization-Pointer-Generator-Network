The widow of a church organist murdered on the way to church a year ago has spoken movingly about how she has forgiven his killers.

Maureen Greaves, 64, said she would not describe the two men convicted of the motiveless attack on husband Alan, 68, as ‘evil’ and her strong Christian faith had enabled her to extend to them ‘real and true forgiveness’.

Rather than rage or anger, the shocking crime has left Mrs Greaves with a ‘very deep bewilderment’.She said she was left asking herself: ‘How did this happen? How could anybody just walk down a road and be murdered like this?’

Maureen Greaves has said she will keep on forgiving the men responsible for killing her husband, Alan, on Christmas Eve 2012

Mr Greaves, a father of four and grandfather, was beaten with a pickaxe by strangers while walking to play at Midnight Mass at his local church in Sheffield on Christmas Eve 2012.

He died in hospital three days later.

Last July, Jonathan Bowling, 22, was sentenced to life for his murder and Ashley Foster, 22, jailed for nine years for manslaughter.

They were out looking for trouble when they set upon Mr Greaves, Sheffield Crown Court was told.

Speaking to Radio 4’s Today programme, Mrs Greaves said that at the sentencing hearing, ‘I looked across at them and I kind of found myself thinking, “why am I forgiving these people? 

'They have taken from me the person I
 loved most in the world and they have taken from me the person who 
loved me the most in the world”.’

Mrs Greaves broke down in tears at a candelit service attended by 300 people on the anniversary of her husband's death

The 64-year-old said the men convicted 'needed to face the consequences' of what they had done to her husband, a church organist

But she said it wasn’t long before she was praying to God for the ability to ‘keep on forgiving them’.

Mrs Greaves broke down in tears at a 
candlelit service attended by 300 people on the anniversary of and at 
the same spot as the attack.

However, she spoke calmly and in detail about her feelings towards the killers in the radio interview.She said that despite her forgiveness, she had always ‘wanted justice for Alan’. 

She said: ‘For me these two men did a very evil act, although I don’t want to call them evil men because I don’t know them. 

‘They needed to face the consequences of what they did.’

Mrs Greaves said she had received a letter from Bowling and had replied simply by saying, ‘I have read your letter and thank you for it.’ 

The judge said Bowling would serve a 
minimum of 25 years before being considered for release. Mrs Greaves 
said this was ‘a just punishment’.

The wedding of her daughter Emma made the anniversary of Alan's death more manageable, said Mrs Greaves

Seeing her husband's wedding ring being placed on her daughter's finger at her wedding last year was an 'emotional' experience she said

She said her family was disappointed by Foster’s nine-year term for the lesser offence but were comforted by the fact he would be ‘recognised’ after his release because of the high-profile nature of the crime he committed.

Mrs Greaves said the anniversary was made easier by the marriage of her daughter Emma, 38, to David Marshall, 40, on December 28.

Emma wore her father’s ring as her wedding ring. ‘On the day of the wedding it was very emotional for me to see the ring being put on her finger,’ said Mrs Greaves.
