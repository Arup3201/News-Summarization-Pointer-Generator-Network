A former television presenter in Turkey has been held by police after posting a tweet suggesting a cover-up in a government corruption scandal.

Sedef Kabas revealed she was being questioned after telling her Twitter followers not to forget the name of a judge who dropped a corruption and bribery probe in the country earlier this year. 

She later confirmed that officers had seized her laptop computer, her iPad and her telephone, according to reports in Turkey.

The government has yet to confirm the detention of Kabas amid claims of deteriorating media freedoms in the country.

The corruption scandal, which broke last year, implicated people close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and led to the ouster of four ministers, AP reports.

The government - pointing to an alleged plot to remove it from office by followers of Fethullah Gulen, an influential US-based Muslim cleric - moved to reassign hundreds of police, prosecutors and judges, including those involved in the case.

The case was later dropped, leading to accusations from the opposition of a cover-up.

Meanwhile, a judicial body which oversees judges and prosecutors has suspended four prosecutors  who had initiated the corruption probes, pending the outcome of an investigation into whether they had abused their powers.

The prosecutors, whom the government has accused of being close to Gulen, face possible ouster from their profession.

Earlier this month, police raided a newspaper and a TV station close to Gulen's movement, detaining journalists, producers and even scriptwriters, sparking criticism from the European Union and the United States.

Last week, a teenager was briefly arrested at his school for allegedly insulting Erdogan during a student protest.
