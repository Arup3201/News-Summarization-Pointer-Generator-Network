Changes: Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick said that anti-terrorist policing was seen a decade ago as 'the macho end of a macho organisation'

Muslim families in Britain are reporting their sons and brothers to police if they fear they will leave to fight in Syria, it was revealed today.

Scotland Yard has announced a large increase in arrests of world-be jihadists this year as it embarks on a more ‘sensitive’ and ‘less macho’ approach to fighting terrorism.

The London force says families, officers and community leaders are working better together – and this is being partly put down to an all-female leadership in Britain’s anti-terrorist police team.

More Syria-related arrests have happened 
since the start of 2014 than in all 2013, which police say is down to 
parents who would rather their sons were arrested in Britain than killed
 fighting.

Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick told The Times: ‘We’re getting lots of support from families who are ringing up and saying they are worried about their brother, son, sister sometimes, friend or indeed from other sources of information and intelligence.

'We [have] certainly got a lot more information and a lot more concerned people.

'We want to increase the proportion of people that would contact us, but we are getting a lot of calls for help.’

Miss Dick - Britain’s most senior woman officer - has two female deputies in Helen Ball, national co-ordinator of anti-terror investigations and Patricia Gallan, head of security and protection.

She added that anti-terrorist policing 
was seen a decade ago as ‘the macho end of a macho organisation’, but 
there is now more focus on being ‘in tune with the communities we’re 
serving’.

While terror arrests are rising, there has been a sharp fall in stop-and-searches for counter-terrorism purposes - and there are now fewer major armed operations, reported The Times.

These include the botched fatal shooting of Brazilian man Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell Underground station in South London in 2005 - which was overseen by 53-year-old Miss Dick.

Now, UK officials fear that Britons who have fought with militants in Syria will return more radicalised, with both new paramilitary skills and with direct contacts to Al Qaeda or its affiliates.

US and UK officials say hundreds of British citizens have travelled to Syria to join anti-government rebels - and as many as 100 Britons are in Syria fighting with militants at any time.

Abdul Waheed Majeed - DEADThe 41-year-old from Crawley, West Sussex, was believed to be the UK's first suicide bomber in Syria. News of his death was reported last month after he detonated a heavily armoured truck near the entrance to Aleppo Central Prison. 

Mohamed and Akram Sebah - BOTH DEADMohamed, 28, a maths tutor, and Akram, 24, an estate agent, were brothers from Holloway, north London, who become poster boys for Al Qaeda. Dubbed 'Lions of Britain' by fellow jihadists, they died in unknown circumstances last September.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - ALIVEThe 23-year-old 'Hip hop jihadist' walked out of his family's £1million home in Maida Vale, west London, last year to join militant groups, telling them he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah'. Bary is an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene, and his songs have featured on BBC Radio 1.

Anil Khalil Raofi - DEADA
 20-year-old student from Didsbury, Manchester, who was reported last 
month to have been killed in a gunfight with Syrian government forces. 
Also known as Abu Layth al-Khurasani, he was believed to have left 
Britain last August.
