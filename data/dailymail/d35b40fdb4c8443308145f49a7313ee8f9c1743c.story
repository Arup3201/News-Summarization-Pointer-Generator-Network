Brianna Wu called police following a series of violent tweets from an account named 'Death to Brianna'

A female games developer has been forced to flee her home after a Twitter user posted her address on the social networking site and threatened to rape her.

Brianna Wu, developer of sci-fi action puzzler Revolution 60, called police following a series of violent tweets from an account named 'Death to Brianna.'

The anonymous person behind the online attack made it clear that they were doing so because of her outspoken support of women in tech and gaming. 

The bio of the account, which has now been suspended, read: 'I'm going to kill Brianna Wu and her husband Frank.'

One of the tweets Wu received on Friday night spoke about raping and choking her, while another threatened to kill any children she had.

Most of the tweets were too graphic for MailOnline to publish. 

The last tweet publicly published Wu's home address and in response Wu, head of development for the indie video game publisher Giant Spacekat, contacted Arlington police.

Wu wrote on Twitter: 'The police just came by. Husband and I are going somewhere safe

'I want to be crystal clear - I am scared of the death threats I've gotten.'

Wu has long been critical of the recently-formed Gamergate movement and what she and others have seen as the targeting of women in the industry.  

Wu wrote on Friday evening that she was leaving her home for 'somewhere safe'

In August, indie video game developer Zoe Quinn was so severely harassed she had to go into hiding

She told Kotaku that she went into a 8Chan, a pro-Gamergate message board and saw users were posting her home address on the forum. 

'I was literally watching 8chan go after me in their specific chatroom for Gamergate,' she said. 

'They posted my address, and within moments I got that death threat.' 

Wu said the threats came after she shared a meme making fun of video gamer group, Gamergate. 

'Anyone who advocates for gender equality, or better representation, or even just a more open discussion is considered an enemy to be bullied, boycotted or, in some cases, harassed.'

Wu insists despite the threats that she will still appear at ComicCon on Sunday. 

It is not the first time a female game developer has been threatened.

In August, indie video game developer Zoe Quinn and feminist theorist Anita Sarkeesian were so severely harassed they had to go into hiding, reports Boston.com. 

Other female journalists have been targeted so viciously they have vowed not to write about the video gaming world again.

Arlington Police confirmed that the department is investigating the origin of the message. 

Twitter has since suspended the account.

According to gaming editor Eric Johnson Gamergate is a sizable online community of videogame fans. 

He wrote: They 'are upset about growing criticisms of their favorite hobby, especially claims that today's games often depict women in demeaning ways. 

'Complicating the matter further, Gamergate advocates say the debate about women in gaming is being enabled by a weak and corrupt gaming press.… But that's not what Gamergate has shown it cares about in practice. 

'The labels of 'ethics' and 'corruption' are, to date, a thin veil over an ongoing attempt to undermine women in the gaming industry and the games press.'
