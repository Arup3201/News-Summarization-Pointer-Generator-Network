Lovelorn Prince Harry toured Elvis Presley’s Graceland to the sound of Heartbreak Hotel as it emerged he has shunned his hard-partying friends in a bid to win back Cressida Bonas.

A sombre Harry, 29, refused to join in late-night high-jinks to celebrate the wedding of close pal Guy Pelly in Memphis this weekend.

While others in the 150-strong party stayed up until 3am at Memphis’s five-star Peabody Hotel – at one point racing through the lobby slapping each other’s bottoms while clutching overflowing champagne glasses – an absent Harry remained resolutely out of public view.

Harry and William flew to America to be ushers at yesterday’s wedding of Guy Pelly to Memphis ‘society queen’ Lizzy Wilson. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were also guests.

The Prince seemed ‘down in the dumps’ as he toured Elvis’s mansion on Friday, according to a guide who added: ‘He seemed quiet, a bit sad.’

Later on Friday night the two Princes attended a formal wedding rehearsal dinner, but while many in the group continued the party back at their hotel, Harry was a no-show.

About 20 guests piled back to the bar around midnight and downed champagne cocktails and shots. At one point they raced through the lobby before posing for ‘selfies’.

One reveller wore a flashing lit-up hat. The festivities continued until the bar closed at 3am but Harry is thought to have retired hours earlier, much to the chagrin of some ‘Henry-ettas’ (as the Prince’s American fans dub themselves) waiting outside.

One girl, called Rachel, said she had flown from California as soon as she heard the Prince was in Memphis. ‘I would follow him anywhere,’ she said, ‘but this time he has hardly been around.’

And on Thursday evening, too, Harry left the celebrations early. A source said: ‘Harry’s been keeping away from the cameras, sending a clear message to Cressie that he’s ready to commit to her and that she is wrong to doubt him.’
