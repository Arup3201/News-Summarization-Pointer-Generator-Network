The Duchess of Cambridge is set to make her first public appearance since her second pregnancy was announced, Buckingham Palace revealed today.

Kate, who has been suffering from a severe form of morning sickness, has been forced to cancel a series of engagements, among them a state visit to Malta.

But, says the Palace, the Duchess is now well enough to return to work and will, along with Prince William, formally welcome Singaporean president Tony Tan when he arrives in Britain in two weeks time, ahead of a four-day state visit.

Fond memories: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge first met President Tan in Singapore in 2012

The Duchess, whose pregnancy was announced on the 8th September, hasn't been seen in public since August, because of a severe bout of hyperemesis gravidarum which she experienced during the early stages of her first pregnancy.

A series of engagements were cancelled after it was announced  that Kate was pregnant and had the illness, which affects one in 50 pregnancies.

In addition to being forced to cancel last month's trip to Malta, which was completed by Prince William instead, she also missed Prince Harry’s enormously successful Invictus Games.

Kensington Palace did warn that she may yet be forced to cancel this latest engagement, and has said her appearances are being reviewed on a 'case by case' basis.

Cancelled: The Duchess has been forced to cancel several appearances, including one to Oxford with the Duke

Missing out: The Duchess was also forced to pull out of attending the hugely successful Invictus Games

Last appearance: The Duchess' last official appearance was at the Tower of London on the 5th August

Whether or not the Duchess does ultimately attend, the event marks an important milestone for the Duke and signals a ratcheting up of his official duties. 

The Duke and Duchess, who first met Mr Tan during a state visit to Singapore in September 2012, will greet the president and his wife Mary at the Royal Garden Hotel in London upon their arrival on the 21st October.

They are then due to travel with the presidential couple to Horse Guards Parade, where the pair will receive a formal ceremonial welcome from the Queen.

During the state visit, the couple will stay with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace and will make a number of engagements around the UK, with trips to Bristol and Kew Gardens among those announced by the Palace.
