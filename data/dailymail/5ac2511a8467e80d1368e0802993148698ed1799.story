Harriet Harman distanced herself from explosive claims that an aide to a former Tory prime minister was 
involved in a 'powerful paedophile network'

Harriet Harman yesterday distanced herself from explosive claims by a senior Labour MP that an aide to a former Tory prime minister was involved in a 'powerful paedophile network' while working in Downing Street.

Labour's deputy leader repeatedly refused to say whether the party's deputy chairman Tom Watson was 'justified' in making claims about a senior Tory's alleged involvement in child abuse, which sparked a frenzy of speculation on the internet.

'He thinks it has justified the claim he has made,' she said.

Tory critics claim Mr Watson's decision to raise the issue in Parliament rather than discussing it privately with the police has led to the 'smearing' of a number of senior Conservatives on the internet.

Mr Watson used Parliamentary privilege last month to claim in the Commons that he was aware of 'clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10'.

He spoke of a 'senior aide to a former prime minister' being involved.

His allegations are thought to be different from those made by the disastrous Newsnight investigation which led to false claims about the former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine.

On the BBC's Sunday Politics show yesterday, presenter Andrew Neil asked Miss Harman if she agreed it was important that 'people don't make wild and unsubstantiated accusations that result in senior people being accused of things which are wholly false ... and the kind of accusations Tom Watson made has encouraged that'.

Miss Harman replied: 'Well he didn't make any mention of any names.'

But Mr Neil said Mr Watson's claims had 'immediately encouraged massive Twitter speculation â€“ names came into the frame with not a scintilla of evidence'.

Miss Harman hesitated and then replied: 'I am afraid I cannot say, having not seen the information, whether it will turn out that that was justified.'

Mr Watson did not respond to phone calls yesterday.

But in an open letter to the Tory MP Rob Wilson, he said that in raising the matter with the Prime Minister he hoped to ensure the police were aware of 'clear intelligence held by them that would warrant a second look'.
