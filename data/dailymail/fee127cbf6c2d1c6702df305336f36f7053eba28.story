The decision to hire bankers from Goldman Sachs to advise on selling off Royal Mail was like giving Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs a job at Securicor, MPs claimed today.

The powerful business select committee expressed astonishment that ministers did not know that Goldman Sachs was being sued for undervaluing a toy firm a decade ago.

Business Secretary Vince Cable today admitted the buck stops with him for selling shares in the firm at £3.30, which have since surged to more than £5.65 today.

Booming: Royal Mail revealed a doubling of profits today, as ministers and officials were grilled over the undervaluing of the firm when it was privatised last month

Goldman Sachs was a joint global co-ordinator of the float along with UBS.

The two investment banks have been accused of getting the valuation ‘sizeably wrong’, with the firm priced at £3.3billion now valued at £5.6billion.

Today Mr Cable was challenged on who signed off the price before the flotation last month. ‘Ultimately I did,’ he said.

But MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills select committee challenged the minister and his officials over why Goldman Sachs was even involved in the process.

Last month the firm agreed a $7.5million settlement over the 1999 flotation of the online toy seller eToys Inc, which it was claimed was undervalued by Goldman Sachs.

Shares quadrupled in value when they began trading, but two years late the firm had gone bust.

Grilling ministers and officials today, Labour MP Ann McKechin said: ‘Goldman Sachs has just settled a litigation case for £7.5m after it was accused of undervaluing an IPO.

‘Were any of you aware of this at the time when making your assessment of the share price, and if so had you taken this into account when you appointed them as one of the float co-ordinators.’

Mark Russell, chief executive of 
Shareholder Executive which manages the government’s stake, admitted: 
‘To answer your question we were not aware of that.’

Committee
chairman Adrian Bailey said: ‘I find it quite astonishing that 
something  that was publically available on Google should be understood 
closely involved in the process.

‘From
outside I have to say that appointing Goldman Sachs on a flotation 
given this court case is a bit like asking Ronnie Biggs to have an 
appointment at Securicor.’

Royal Mail shares continued to rise today after the newly-listed company posted a big jump in half-year profits.

In
early trading today shares were selling at just over £5.60, some 70 per
cent higher than the £3.30 at its flotation last month.

With a market valuation of £5.5 billion, the company is on course to be admitted to the FTSE 100 Index in a reshuffle of the top flight next month.

In its first set of results as a listed company, Royal Mail revealed operating profits nearly doubled to £283 million for the six months to September 29 from £144 million a year earlier, although figures were boosted by £95 million after a VAT credit and lower-than-expected costs of its overhaul programme.

The parcels business saw sales volumes growth grind to a halt as the summer heatwave slowed online purchases, while Royal Mail also said the threat of strike action had since cost it business parcel customers in its key Christmas quarter.

But the group said the recent launch of size-based pricing was offsetting the slowdown in demand and added the spate of energy bill hikes was benefiting its letter business in the second half as providers send out mailings to millions of customers.

Mr Cable stuck by his previous description of the early gains as 'froth' and said the true value of the shares would not emerge for months.

The minister also took issue with any suggestion that banks had acted illegally, and told the MPs that the sale was good for the taxpayer and for the future of the six day a week delivery service offered by the Royal Mail.

'This has been a very professional, well organised and successful operation,' he said.
