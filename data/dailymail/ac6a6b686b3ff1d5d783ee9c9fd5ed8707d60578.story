After becoming a hero in New England thanks to his play on the field in Super Bowl XLIX, Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler is  becoming known for his heroics off the gridiron as well.

The Super Bowl champion paid a visit to Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts on Friday and told sick patients, 'You can do anything.'

The rookie defensive back, 24, sat and talked with children, took pictures and signed autographs during the visit.

During his visit, Butler told patients: 'If you work hard and do the right thing, you can do anything' 

The rookie, 24, was the hero of Super Bowl XLIX for the New England Patriots despite his limited playing time

The unlikely star, who worked at a Popeyes chicken restaurant in Mississippi before joining the Patriots, also handed out signed football gloves, the Boston Herald reported. 

He began his visit by meeting with patients on long-term stays and then did a special Q&A session at the hospital's in-house radio studio that was broadcast to every patient's room.

Sam Clark, 17, who is recovering from open-heart surgery after being born with cardiomyopathy, was one of the hosts. 

Butler told Clark and others: 'If you work hard and do the right thing, you can do anything.'

Clark took Butler's message quite seriously and said he 'won't give up until the clock strikes zero'.

A Boston Children's spokeswoman said Butler's visit helped patients take their minds off of being sick

During the interview, Butler also answered questions about the Chevy Colorado pickup truck he is supposed to be getting from quarterback Tom Brady. 

Brady was awarded the truck after winning Super Bowl Most Valuable Player honors and vowed to give it to Butler. 

It sounds like Butler will not be keeping the red model of the Chevy that was on the field in Arizona.

Butler said: 'Yeah, I'm getting the truck. I just have to call the dealership.

'I'll probably get it black or blue.'

An update about the truck Butler is getting from Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady was provided during the visit. Butler said he was getting the truck and that 'I'll probably get it black or blue'

The patients at Boston Children's were inspired by Butler's visit and he was inspired by them in return 

The undrafted free agent appeared in 11 games this season, recording 15 tackles and three passes defended. 

The pick he made at the goal line that allowed the Patriots to maintain their 28-24 lead over the Seattle Seahawks and win the Super Bowl was his only interception of the season for the Pats.

Boston Children's spokeswoman Kristen Dattoli said: 'It takes your mind off of being sick for a little while, and that is truly the best gift that you can give these patients.'
