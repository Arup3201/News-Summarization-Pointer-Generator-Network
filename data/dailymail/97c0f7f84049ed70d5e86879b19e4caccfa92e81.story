Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger admits he failed to land all of his transfer targets in the summer window and says the club will reinvest in the squad again in January. 

Wenger made five additions to his squad during the last transfer window as the FA Cup holders looked to strengthen.

Alexis Sanchez's £30million arrival from Barcelona was the standout signing by Wenger, but the Frenchman has admitted he felt his business was uncompleted - something he will look to rectify in the next window.

'We won the FA Cup with a difficult run, but we managed to deliver the trophy and it makes us stronger, more confident and I believe we will have a strong season,' Wenger told shareholders and a selection of fans at the club's Annual General Meeting.

'We bought good players, I believe we've done remarkably well in the transfer market. We wanted one more player, but couldn't. We will try to rectify that in January.

'We have a good core of young British players, who feel the value of our club. Slowly the modern game has lost that.

'So we need your support again. I encourage you to be behind us. You are magnificent. And I'm sure we will come out this season more united and stronger.'

The Gunners currently sit eighth in the Premier League - nine points adrift of league leaders Chelsea after seven games of the season.

Arsenal lost 2-0 to the Blues in their last Premier League match and Wenger has urged fans to be patient despite their sluggish beginning to the campaign.

The 64-year-old cites the poor start the club made last season before they went onto to lift silverware.

‘This is always an important part of my season, I know you are ambitious, critical and sceptical, but you are very loyal. And I'm very grateful to see the same faces because we love this club. I know I don't always please you like I love to, but we give it all to make you happy,' Wenger added.

'Let’s remember last season, we started with a home defeat and I felt a little tsunami around the club. There was pressure for us to sign players and scepticism. We showed we were united, together and ready to work hard.

'What has changed compared with a few years ago is other clubs have resources so top players have more choices. We signed (Mesut) Ozil which gave us comfort. We made 79 points and you have to be consistent for that.

'It was extremely paradoxical. When we lost, we lost [heavily]. We lost five or six. If you concede the first goal in a big game 85 per cent of the time you will lose the game.' 

Wenger ended the club's nine-season wait for a trophy with a 3-2 FA Cup final victory against Hull in May

Arsenal's 3-2 FA Cup win against Hull in May  ended their nine-season wait for a trophy and majority shareholder Stan Kroenke believes the Wembley victory shows that the club are going in the right direction under Wenger - who recently celebrated 18 years in charge of the club. 

'We are proud of what we've accomplished,' Kroenke said.

'What a wonderful day that was at Wembley. One of the reasons we were interested in Arsenal was because of Arsene Wenger, and we look forward to much more success with him.'
