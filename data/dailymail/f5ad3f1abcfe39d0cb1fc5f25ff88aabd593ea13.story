Emergency response: A police officer at the Port Columbus International Airport shot and killed a man during a confrontation just outside the terminal at 1pm Wednesday  

'There was a threat, and we were responding to that,' said Whitaker, who didn't have details of what happened before the officer fired at the suspect. He said the man did not fire at the officer.

The man was believed to have arrived at the airport alone, but Whitaker didn't know if he was scheduled to be on a flight.

The departures area was blocked off Wednesday afternoon, but the airport said  flights were running as scheduled, with only some affected by the emergency.

Departing passengers were directed to enter through the arrivals area on the lower curb level. 

An SUV linked to the incident was being searched for explosives by a bomb squad as a precaution, Whitaker said.

WBNS reported that the suspect was in the ticketing lobby outside security checkpoints.

Police said there was also a call for an officer in trouble just before shots were fired. 

Speaking to the Columbus Dispatch Wednesday evening, eyewitness Jim Shriner said he saw the suspect advance on two uniformed police officers and reach for his waistband before a third plainclothes cop shot and killed him. 

Shriner, the owner of a towing business, said he was called to the airport to haul away an illegally parked car.

When he pulled up outside the departures area, Shriner said he saw a man fighting with two officers and heard two shots fired. 

 The suspect went down, but then got back up and proceeded to advance on the two officers who had their guns drawn but were retreating.

The man pointed at his waistband, but Shriner said he did not see a gun there. One of the uniformed cops struck the suspect with a baton on his legs before the third officer arrived and shot him dead.  

Shriner speculated that he may have been called to the airport to tow the slain suspect's SUV from the terminal. 

A perimeter around that area could lead to some flight delays for Delta passengers.

'We don't think that there's an ongoing threat at the moment,' Whitaker said. 'We believe the situation is contained as I've described.'

Matt Diehl of Columbus was waiting to board a flight in a growing crowd. He had two hours before it took off for Philadelphia for business, but he wasn't sure if it wouldn't be delayed.

'I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but at this point I'm not optimistic,' he said.
