Denis Napthine has conceded defeat in the Victorian election and congratulated Daniel Andrews on Labor's win. 

The results make the Napthine Coalition  Victoria's first government in over fifty years to be kicked out after just one term in office. More than a million pre-poll votes are still to be counted.

'The figures clearly indicate that there has been a swing to the Labor Party and they will have a majority in the legislative assembly,' Dr Napthine told Liberal supporters.

'Therefore, it's appropriate for myself as leader of the government, as leader of the Liberal Party, to do the right thing by the people of Victoria and to contact Mr Andrews and inform him that I have conceded that he has won this election and we congratulate Mr And Andrews on that victory.'

In his victory speech, Daniel Andrews thanked Denis Napthine and said he would not let voters down. 

'The people of Victoria have today given to us the greatest of gifts, entrusted to us the greatest of responsibilities and bestowed upon us the greatest of honours and, ladies and gentlemen, we will not let them down,' he said.

More than a million pre-poll votes are still to be counted, but early figures showed a clear labour win. 

As the vote counts came in, ABC election analyst Antony Green predicted Labor could end up with 48 seats in the 88-seat parliament.

Former Victorian premier Steve Bracks said in early ABC election coverage that the results were 'a clear win to Labor.' 

Former Liberal premier Jeff Kennett was not calling it but said a Labor victory was likely unless 1.1 million pre-poll votes were dramatically different.

'In all the seats that we needed to do well in, in order to hang onto - the drift is going away from us,' he told the Seven Network.

'We're heading towards a Labor win. I think they'll be a lot of soul-searching after this.'

Health Minister David Davis said the Liberal Party remained hopeful of gaining ground when postal and pre-polling votes are counted.

'This is a situation where about a third of the votes are not counted and will not be counted tonight. In that circumstance we need to be careful about making hasty judgments,' Mr Davis said.

Spirits were low at the Liberal party post-election event at Melbourne's Sofitel, where a thin crowd had been served smoked salmon and cucumber sandwiches while they watched the count.

Greens leader Greg Barber claimed victory in the lower house seat of Melbourne on the screens above their heads.

Premier Denis Napthine arrived around 6.30pm but retreated to a private room at the hotel to watch the count with wife Peggy and son Tom.

Former federal treasurer Peter Costello said the Napthine Liberal government had suffered because it had failed to properly sell the East West Link plan.

'If the government was going to be re-elected and win the election it had to make that the dominant issue of the campaign,' said Costello.

But Costello, and others, said there were also federal issues at play. 

'I think the last federal budget was clearly toxic in Victoria,' he said.

When Federal Labor leader Bill Shorten introduced the new Premier at a Labor party function, he said the win was a clear message for Tony Abbott.

'They said this couldn't happen. They said that a first term government couldn't lose. We are witnessing history in the making. This is a sensational outcome,' Mr Shorten told reporters in Melbourne.

Former Victorian community services minister Mary Wooldridge also said the Abbott budget had 'been significant' and cited the rise in petrol tax and cuts to the ABC as particularly unpopular with Victorian voters.

Labor focus groups showed concern over university fee deregulation was another key issue, and one senior Labor source said voters often mentioned their concerns about the Abbott government, but no strong anger against the Napthine government.

Federal Labor frontbencher and Victorian senator Kim Carr told reporters that car-making electorates and fruit-processing areas like Shepparton had swung away from the coalition because of a lack of industry support - but agreed the Abbott budget was also a big factor.
