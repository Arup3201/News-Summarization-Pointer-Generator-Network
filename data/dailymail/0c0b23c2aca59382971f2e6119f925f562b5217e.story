Manchester United were held to a shock 0-0 draw against League Two minnows Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday night.

Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Co failed to break down the team from the fourth tier of English football as United's expensively assembled strike force drew a blank, earning only a replay at Old Trafford.

It was a result that angered United boss Louis van Gaal, but where does this upset rank among United's biggest cup shocks?
