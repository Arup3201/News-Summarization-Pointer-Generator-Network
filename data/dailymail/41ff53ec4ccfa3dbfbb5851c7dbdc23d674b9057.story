The driver who ploughed into a lollipop lady and four children outside a school said he cannot remember what happened between suffering a coughing fit and his car overturning.

Robert Bell, 61, was driving his granddaughter to school when he began coughing at a set of traffic lights.

His out-of-control Audi overturned after
mounting a speed hump when the retired driver stepped on the 
accelerator instead of the brake.

He said: 'I was stationary and my granddaughter said I coughed - and the next thing I knew I’m coming round.

Robert Bell said he cannot remember what happened after his coughing fit behind the wheel of his black Audi, seen after the crash

'Very serious': Police said there were 'multiple casualties' as a result of the accident including adults and children

'I’d been unconscious and upside down. I haven’t a clue what happened.

'Luckily my granddaughter came round before me.

'She just has tiny minor cuts. She had the sense of mind to undo her seatbelt and reach over and undo mine and we then dropped.'

A nine-year-old schoolgirl was still in intensive care with a fractured skull today.

Hero lollipop lady Karin Williams, 50, who tried to use her pole to protect schoolchildren, was recovering from surgery for fractures to both legs, both kneecaps, arms and her shoulder.

Mr Bell suffered cuts and bruises in the crash and was released from hospital after having stitches for a head wound.

'Chaos': Witnesses said the road was 'choc-a-bloc' with children arriving for school at the time of the accident

Police were due to interview him about the crash outside a primary school in Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan, which happened at 8.50am yesterday.

Four girls and a boy under the age of ten were injured along with two mothers who were walking them to school.

The father of one of the injured girls said he did not blame Mr Bell for the crash.

Matthew Roymon, who lives opposite Mr Bell, said: 'I believe it was an accident - I don’t blame Mr Bell in any way.'

Mr Roymon’s daughter is still in hospital with injuries to a tendon in her hand and a broken nose.

Education psychologists have been brought in to help children who witnesses the accident outside Rhys Primary School.

Injured: Lollipop lady Karin Williams was said to have been left trapped beneath the Audi following the crash

Mr Bell’s black Audi was seen spinning
in ‘mid-air’ before it careered into the group outside the school in the centre of the village, 15 miles outside Cardiff, at the 
start of the school day.

Witnesses described seeing  
50-year-old Mrs Williams trapped under the vehicle with blood pouring 
from her head after it came to a rest on the pavement.

A 39-year-old nurse who found Ms Williams trapped under the vehicle told The Sun: 'Karin had tried to save the kids by standing in the way of the car holding her pole out sideways to block it.

'I went over and she was conscious and could recognise me but had blood all over her face.

'She said, "I'm scared, I'm really scared. Please tell me it wasn't my fault."'

Shelly Morgan-Stone, 33, was taking 
her son Archie, seven, to the school when she saw the car ‘flying 
through the air’.

She added: ‘All I heard was a horrific screaming 
followed by the crash of metal and the sound of breaking glass and 
people running towards the scene.

‘One mother was on the floor on her knees, leaning over her child – she was wailing.

‘It was horrible, the screaming especially, I will never forget the sound of the mothers screaming.’

Another witness described seeing 
‘children lying injured in the road’, adding: ‘The lollipop lady was 
trapped – all I could see was her jacket from under the car.’

The 
injured were taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and 
the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.

Ian Morris, from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said the nine-year-old girl was in a paediatric intensive care unit.

Mrs Williams, who is German, met her 
husband Lyndon when he was in the Army and stationed in her homeland. 

Safety: The crash happened at the pedestrian crossing by Rhoose Primary School where the speed limit is just 20mph

Investigation: South Wales police say the 61-year-old male driver is helping with their inquiries - but it is not thought the accident was a deliberate act

Wreckage: The overturned Audi was take away on a recovery truck as police continue to investigate the crash

The couple have a daughter, Svenja, 22, a shop worker, and the trio live
in a flat just yards from the school.

Mr Williams is an ambulance 
driver, based at nearby Barry Ambulance Station, whose role involves 
taking elderly patients to and from hospital.

Earlier this year, Mrs Williams was 
recognised in the ‘Top of the Lollipops’ road safety awards organised by
the Vale of Glamorgan Council.

Neighbour Tommy Nettleship, 93, 
described her as a ‘lifesaver’ who visited him up to three times a day 
to keep him company and care for him.

He added: ‘Karin has virtually 
adopted me as her father.

‘She is a wonderful woman. She loves being a lollipop lady and is very dedicated.’

It is believed Mrs Williams knew Mr 
Bell, whose granddaughter lives with him and his wife in the village, 
which borders Cardiff Airport. A woman believed to be Mrs Bell refused 
to comment at the couple’s home last night.

Police said no other vehicles were involved in the 8.50am incident.

The school remained open yesterday, with an education psychologist sent in to work with pupils.

Chief Superintendent Joe Ruddy, of 
South Wales Police, said investigators would be examining the speed of 
the vehicle ‘among other circumstances’, and urged witnesses to contact 
the force.
