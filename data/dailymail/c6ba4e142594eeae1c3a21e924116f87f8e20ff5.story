Murdered: Nastya Lutsishina was stabbed twice in the neck

A taxi driver abducted and killed an eight-year-old girl as his wife was giving birth to his own daughter.

Anatoliy Trapko, 28, attempted to rape Nastya Lutsishina but failed because he could not get an erection, said Russian police.

In a fit of rage, he stabbed the girl twice, once through the neck. He then hid her body in a remote place 164 yards away from the road leading to the 
village Banevurovo in Ussuriisk district.

As a hunt involving hundreds of volunteers got underway for the missing girl, Trapko's wife Svetlana, 30, was giving birth to his daughter at a hospital in Ussuriisk.

He did not have time to visit his wife and new daughter before he was arrested.

Police say he confessed to the attempted rape and stabbing of the eight-year-old who went missing after her physical education class finished ten minutes early.

Handcuffed, he yesterday explained to police how he carried out the attack.

Nastya set off on a 110-yard walk home from her track and field training, but Trapko coaxed her into his car by offering to show her a kitten. He drove her nine miles outside the city before attacking her.

Police were able to trace Trapko thanks to dashboard cameras which have become popular with Russian drivers.

Vladimir Markin, spokesman for the Russian Investigation Committee, said: 'An eyewitness had seen the taxi driver talking to the girl, and a driver had footage showing her getting into his car'

'The taxi driver detained on Saturday gave the confessing testimony and told about details of the crime.

'The knife was found at his house that was reportedly used for inflicting two knife wounds to the girl he told the Siberian Times.

Earlier a local police source told Ussur news website: 'The child was killed. There were multiple wounds on her body. There are reasons to think that the criminal raped the girl'.
