Facebook: Mandy Ashforth and Barrie Moat celebrated their engagement after the date that never happened 32 years ago

A couple who reunited through Facebook have tied the knot more than three decades after one stood the other up.

Mandy Ashforth, 48, from Yorkshire got over the fact that Barrie Moat, 50, stood her up 32 years ago and the pair showed that there were no hard feelings by getting married.

But things did not go smoothly between them at first.

The couple first met on holiday in 
Bridlington, East Yorkshire in 1982 and were inseparable until Barrie, 
then 19, left a heartbroken 17-year-old Mandy alone at the bus station.

However, Mandy said that as the years passed by she never forget about Barrie.

In 2013, over 30 years since he stood her up, she did a random search on a social networking site for 
fishing pole repair services and ws shocked to find him.

She quickly sent a friend request and soon the pair had rekindled that initial summer 
loving feeling.

The reunited couple delighted friends and family  by getting married exactly 18 months after she sent the friend request to her first love on Facebook. They tied the knot in front of 61 people.

Mandy said: 'It was more than I ever expected - a real fairytale wedding.

'I had a big white dress and everything.

'It's hard to believe that after all these years apart we've got back together and we're now married.'

Mandy said that she had spent years trying to locate Barrie after he stood her up, and 
originally started by wandering around Sheffield - where he was from - 
but to no avail.

In later years she took to Friends Reunited and looked through old school records before they finally met again.

Mandy recalled: 'We met as teenagers in Bridlington in 1982 - I was 17 and Baz was 19. I was from Eastwood and he was from Sheffield.

'We spent all our time together and at the end of the holiday he walked me to my coach and arranged to meet the following week on the Sunday.

'I arrived to meet Baz in Rotherham bus station and waited two hours but he never came to meet me and I was devastated.

'In the year that followed, I looked for Barrie Moat in various places in Sheffield but never found him.

'The months turned into years and Barrie was always in my mind.

'I searched for him numerous times but it always led to a dead end.'

The newlyweds have now returned from a week's honeymoon in Marmaris, Turkey and couldn't be happier.

That happiness seems to have cleared Barrie's memory of the reason he stood up Mandy in the first place.

The 50-year-old said: 'I have no idea why I didn't turn up to meet her - I really can't remember.

'I only joined Facebook to promote my fishing pole repair business and I never normally accept friend requests from women unless they have something to do with fishing.

'For some reason I assumed she was involved with fishing so I clicked to accept it and within seconds she had sent me a message.

'Things very quickly just clicked into place and we both decided we wanted to be together.

'It was just too good to be true. We both knew we had met the right person - I only wish I'd known that 30 years ago.'
