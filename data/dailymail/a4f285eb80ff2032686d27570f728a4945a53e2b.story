A former professor of Barack Obama has turned against his one-time student and publicly urged voters not to re-elect him.

Roberto Unger posted a video on YouTube detailing the reasons why he believes the President does not deserve a second term in the White House.

Mr Unger, a prominent Brazilian politician and an adviser to Obama in 2008, said: 'President Obama must be defeated in the coming election. He has failed to advance the progressive 
cause in the United States.'

Scathing: Obama's former professor Roberto Unger said that he had 'failed' the United States and should not be re-elected

The 65-year-old academic was in frequent contact with Mr Obama on his Blackberry throughout the last election campaign but has since decided that he no longer agreed with the President's decisions.

His list of complaints against the President is a long one in the video entitled 'Beyond Obama'. 

The esteemed philosopher is scathing of Mr Obama's plans to salvage America's ailing economy, saying that his policy solely consists of 'financial confidence and food stamps'.

He adds: 'He has spent trillions of dollars to rescue the moneyed interests and left workers and homeowners to their own devices.'

The
 politician admits that if Republican candidate Mitt Romney wins 
the election 'there will be a cost... in judicial and administrative 
appointments'.

However his most barbed remarks he reserves for the Democrat leader saying that Mr Obama has 'evoked a politics of handholding, but no one changes the world without a struggle'.

Delete! The President regularly talked to Unger during his 2008 campaign... this is no longer likely to be the case

Taking a shot: Roberto Unger criticised President Obama after being a long time supporter

His summary of the past four years is
 equally scathing: 'Give the bond markets what they want, bail out the 
reckless so long as they are also rich, use fiscal and monetary stimulus
 to make up for the absence of any consequential broadening of economic 
and educational opportunity, sweeten the pill of disempowerment with a 
touch of tax fairness, even though the effect of any such tax reform is 
sure to be modest.'

Making enemies: Obama has lost a respected adviser Roberto Unger

Most of Mr Unger's comments seem to 
be politically to the left of Mr Obama, but he insists that the 
Republicans would be no more destructive than the Democrats as 'the risk
 of military adventurism' would remain the same.

And some would doubtless strike a 
chord with the President's GOP opponents, including the academic's 
attacks on Mr Obama's efforts to reform healthcare.

Mr Unger argues: 'He has subordinated
 the broadening of economic and educational opportunity to the important
 but secondary issue of access to health care in the mistaken belief 
that he would be spared a fight.'

He also suggests that, despite their 
fierce rivalry, the Democrats' agenda is little different to that of the
 Republicans, saying the party aims 'to put a human face on the 
programme of its adversaries'.

The professor concludes his video by 
saying: 'Only a political reversal can allow the voice of democratic 
prophecy to speak once again in American life.'

Mr Unger is a renowned politician in 
his native Brazil. He has twice has run for president of Brazil and has 
served as Minister of Strategic Affairs.

Unger was one of the founding members of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and drafted its founding manifesto.

He has also advised on politics throughout Latin America.

Model student: Obama was taught by Unger when he attended Harvard Law School in 1988

The professor is a respected author having published dozens of books on economics, philosophy and politics.

In philosophy, his arguments are said to focus on some the greatest problems of the human existence. 

The video, which was posted three weeks ago, has been viewed 22,000 times.

Mr Unger has taught at Harvard Law since 1976.

Obama studied jurisprudence and reinventing democracy with the professor.

The
 President attended Harvard Law School in 1988 and was selected as an 
editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year.

Last week Obama announced that young immigrants who were brought into the U.S. illegally will no longer be deported.

The
 Obama administration said the policy change announced on Friday will 
affect as many as 800,000 qualified immigrants who have lived in fear of
 deportation.

The President
 also came in for sharp criticism last week after he combined 
fundraising events with an official event - and charged the bill to the 
taxpayer.

Obama raised a total of $4.5million at the fundraisers, one at Sex and the City actress Sarah Jessica Parker's house and the other at the five-star Plaza Hotel.

However,
 the President's re-election campaign will not have to pay the full cost
 of his jaunt to the Big Apple, because he scheduled a short visit to 
the World Trade Center site.
