'Horrific torture': Roy Sly (pictured) was beaten to death over a prolonged period in his flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, a trial heard

A man found dead in his flat after being subjected to 'horrific torture' was so badly bruised police could not at first tell if he was male or female, a jury has heard.

Unemployed Roy Sly, 53, was discovered in his flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, on January 10.

It is thought he had been dead for at least a day and had suffered 59 separate injuries.

As prosecutor William Clegg QC outlined the 'gruesome' case and passed graphic photographs of Mr Sly’s injuries to the jury, a female reserve juror fainted.

Judge Christopher Ball told the jury at Chelmsford Crown Court: 'As you can see, this is not a case for the faint-hearted.'

Mr Clegg said evidence suggested Mr Sly had been tied up while a broom handle was forced into his anus before he was beaten to death over a 'prolonged period'.

Vincent Harty, 39, of Wakering Avenue, Shoeburyness; Lisa Turner, 33, of no fixed address, and Peter Smith, 38, of Furnace Row, Toredyrhiw, Merthyr Tydfil, all deny murder.

Mr Clegg said: 'When police officers entered his flat they found his body lying in the lounge.

'His face had been so badly beaten that police were unable to tell if the body was that of a man or a woman.'

Mr Clegg added that the 'true horror' of the attack was not revealed until the body was examined by a pathologist.

'His face was unrecognisable with numerous cuts and bruises to the head,' he said.

'There were signs of torture to the genital area. The penis had cuts and bruises.

'The anus had bruises confirming the worst fears that while still alive a broom handle or similar implement had been pushed so far into him that it had forced its way into his colon causing significant internal bleeding.'

Mr Sly had suffered so many injuries that it was not possible to identify which was the sole cause of death, the court heard.

Mr Clegg said: 'What is certain is that the attack did kill him.'

He described how Mr Sly had alcohol problems and his relationship with his family had suffered as a result.

'Because of his lifestyle he fell into a
sub-culture of people who tended to drink heavily, take drugs and live a
life where loose morals were the norm rather than the exception,' he 
added.

'Friends and neighbours described him as a drunk. Not an aggressive drunk but a falling down drunk.'

It was this lifestyle that led to him becoming friends with the defendants.

Despite his problems, Mr Sly cared for his elderly mother, who survives him, Mr Clegg added.

When officers arrived, a hypodermic 
needle was sticking out of his arm but, the jury heard, this was a 'red 
herring' designed to give the false impression he was a drug addict.

Mr Clegg said that one possible motive for the killing was a plan to rob Mr Sly of benefits which were paid into his account each fortnight.

Withdrawals had been made from Mr Sly's account while he was 'dead or dying' by somebody who had obtained his card and pin number.

Police later identified that person as the defendant Smith, he added.

After the alleged murder, Turner told a friend 'we've killed somebody', Mr Clegg said.

He added that she explained how Mr Sly screamed in pain shouting 'help me, help me' as he was beaten and an ammonia-based cleaning product was sprayed in his face.

Turner claimed she had been made to take part in the attack as the group forced Mr Sly to hand over his bank details, the court heard.

Mr Clegg said attempts to cover up the attack suggested those responsible were 'forensically aware'.

A pillow case had been placed over Mr Sly's head in an apparent attempt to prevent blood splattering across the flat during the attack.

The trial is expected to last up to four weeks.
