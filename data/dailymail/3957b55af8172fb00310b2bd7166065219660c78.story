With just 300 people, the El Molo might be Kenya's tiniest tribe but they certainly know how to pack a punch - as the local crocodile population is all too well aware.

For this band of hardy men and women are the original Crocodile Dundees and survived for centuries on a diet of the flesh of two of Africa's most dangerous beasts - the hippo and the Nile crocodile.

Sadly for the El Molo, times (and stiff anti-poaching laws) have changed and the tribe is now forced to make a living from fish, although as photographer Eric Lafforgue explains, occasionally, one or two of Lake Turkana's 10,000-strong crocodile population do still fall prey to their harpoons.

Tough guys: The 300-strong El Molo tribe is Kenya's smallest but also one of its toughest thanks to their penchant for fighting crocodiles and even hippos

Bleak: They live on the shores of Lake Turkana, a semi-salty body of water surrounded by volcanic rocks and where temperatures reach up to 45 degrees Celsius

Drinking water: Although salty, the El Molo continue to drink Lake Turkana's water although they do now have fresh water tanks built for them by the government

Changing times: The El Molo are famous for their bravery within Kenya and many are still animists, although some (right) have converted to Christianity

'Unlike neighbouring tribes such as the Turkana and the Samburu, the El Molo are against killing people and 
raiding tor cattle,' he explains. 'They live almost exclusively on 
fish and occasionally some crocodiles from the lake, as the
 environment is too arid to raise cattle.'

Their fishing methods, which involve using small rafts made from doum palm trunks and harpoons, are more than 3,000 years old and usually result in the capture of one of the enormous 2ft catfish that live in the lake, or smaller tilapia.

Large though the catfish are, they're small fry compared to the beasts the tribe used to take on - hippos. 'Before Kenya introduced anti-poaching laws, 
they hunted hippos,' explains Lafforgue.

'The hippo hunter used to be celebrated as a hero and was given a special earring and a necklace to wear.' Hippos, who kill more humans each year than any other creature in Africa, are also one of the most dangerous to hunt and as a result, the El Molo are famous for their bravery.

Other animals on their menu include the crocodile, a favoured food for honoured guests, and although crocodiles are also officially protected, the El Molo still occasionally kill one or two.

Tasty: The El Molo used to be famous for their hippo hunts but are no longer allowed

Dangerous: Hippos are one of the most dangerous animals in Africa and kill many humans

Creative: Hunting and fishing is always done by the men while women are in charge of cooking

Not allowed: Despite having made a living from hunting hippos for centuries, the animals are now protected by law and the El Molo are not allowed to hunt them

Thirsty work: With hippo eating banned, the tribe lives mostly on the 2ft catfish that lurk beneath the lake which they turn into a salty broth using lake water

Traditional: Their fishing techniques are more than 3,000 years old and involve using canoes made from doum palm trunks and handmade harpoons

Ageing: El Molo people have a maximum life expectancy of 45 and consider 40 to be old (left). They also suffer from bone problems thanks to their protein only diet

But while their diet is high in protein, the lack of fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates has led to health problems for the tribe, as has their penchant for drinking the salty water of Lake Turkana.

'You see many people with bone deformities, even in the kids,' explains Lafforgue. 'Some adults 
are unable to walk because of painful bones.

The situation is made worse because until recently, the tribe always married among themselves, which contributed to inbreeding.

'They
 also suffer from a high fluoride intake, which makes their teeth discoloured, and they won't go to clinics because years ago, one of their people died in one.

'Because of that, they usually only live until the age of 45. 40 years old is considered old in the tribe and they can look about 70.'

And it's not just the El Molo themselves who are under threat, but their unique culture too. Younger members of the tribe are starting to swap traditional clothes for western ones, while their language is now extinct and has been replaced with Swahili.

'The
 last man to speak it died in 1974,' explains Lafforgue. 'They had eight words just for the wind.'

Other parts of tribal culture, such as the clan system and a taboo that says it's bad luck to speak the name of the dead remain.

'They
 mix their traditions with Christianity,' adds Lafforgue. 'It's not unusual to see an El Molo
 women wearing a tribal necklace and a cross at the same time.'

Despite embracing Christianity and the modern world, with oil recently discovered close to Lake Turkana and its salinity increasing, the outlook looks bleak for the El Molo, once Africa's bravest tribe.

Dusty: Because of the arid conditions, the El Molo spend a lot of time removing dust from each others eyes - as demonstrated here by two friends

Culture: Although many still embrace traditional dress, many more are starting to wear western clothing, while the El Molo language became extinct in 1974

Small: The El Molo tribe is so small, there are now only two villages - Anderi and Illah - where homes are still made from dried reeds and doum palm leaves

Beautiful:
 The El Molo live on the shores of Lake Turkana in an area dotted with 
volcanic rocks and where the land is too poor for agriculture or cows

Tasty:
 Although they aren't really allowed, one or two of the 10,000 
crocodiles living on Lake Turkana falls prey to El Molo fisherman each 
year

Banned: The El Molo are no longer allowed to hunt the hippo which live in Lake Turkana - a feat that earned them a reputation for bravery among other Kenyan tribes
