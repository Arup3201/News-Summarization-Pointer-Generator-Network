The winning bid of the first large-scale pot auction in American history will walk away with a full ton of marijuana.

That's 2,000 pounds of the product grown by farmer Randy Williams of Fireweed Farm in Prosser, Wash. 

Williams has been cultivating the crop all summer.

Williams has been cultivating the crop all summer.

 USA Today reports that at retail prices, Williams' crop could be valued as high as $6 million. 

'It's just like regular farming - you grow in the spring and summer, harvest in the fall and then you go to Cabo for the winter,' cracked Greg James, who publishes Marijuana Venture, an industry magazine.

James has helped to advertise the sale.

Only state-certified processors will legally be allowed to buy the crop. It can not be sold directly to consumers. 

The plants reach a dozen feet in height.

They were grown in south-central Washington in the area's wine region.

Washington only began allowing recreational sale of marijuana this summer and consumer demand has kept store shelves bare. 

At retail prices, Williams' crop could be valued as high as $6 million

This year's outdoor harvest could flood the market and drive down prices. 

Because there is no need to pay for sunlight as indoor pot farmers must do, outdoor harvests can be bigger and cost less to grow. 

Oregon, Alaska, and Washington D.C. have also legalized recreational marijuana sales.
