A former soldier and game hunter shot himself dead in an apparent suicide following a domestic incident which led to a four-hour stand-off with armed police.

Allan Ellis, 50, a licensed gun owner and butcher, threatened to harm himself when police arrived at his home following reports of a domestic incident at 10.55pm on Wednesday.

Officers sealed off the residential street in Bacup, Lancashire, and coaxed a woman – believed to be his wife Heather- from the property as a negotiator tried to reason with Mr Ellis.

Allan Ellis, 50, a licensed gun owner and butcher, threatened to harm himself when police arrived at his home following reports of a domestic incident. After four hours of negotiations, the former soldier took his own life

The former corporal with the Scots Guards spoke with specialised police officers for about four hours until negotiations broke down.

Armed officers then entered the terraced house and found his body in an upstairs room at 3am on Thursday.

Police confirmed they are not treating his death as suspicious and said no one else was injured in the incident.

Mr Ellis' next-of-kin have been informed and are being looked after by a police family liaison officer.

The former soldier served in the Army from 1980 to 1993 when a serious injury forced him to change career.

He owned a game shop and went into hunting venison, rabbit, boar and other game, which he supplied to farmers' markets across East Lancashire.

He also organised deer hunts, shooting events and ran a catering stand at food festivals. 

A Lancashire Police spokeswoman said the case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), as is routine when a death occurs following police involvement.

Police said the death of Mr Ellis (above) was not being treated as suspicious and said no one else was injured

She said: 'An investigation is under way and the family of the deceased are being supported by police liaison officers.'

Neighbours spoke of their shock at hearing of Mr Ellis' death.

An elderly resident, who has lived in the street for 40 years, told the Lancashire Telegraph: 'My husband went out at about 4.30am and there were three police cars outside.

'It really shocks you knowing that that's happened a few doors down. It's just awful. It must be terrible for Heather and her daughter.'

Another resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It's terrible to think it's happened right on your doorstep.'

Mr Ellis is thought to originally be from the village of Rushyford, in County Durham, and named his game dealing and shooting ware store in Burnley Road East after his hometown when he opened it 12 months ago.
