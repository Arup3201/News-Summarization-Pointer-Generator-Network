Land's End marks the northern tip of Britain, Hadrian's Wall is in Cornwall and the Jurassic Coast is in Scotland.

That's the view of millions of Britons whose lack of geographical knowledge was highlighted in new research.Â 

The report also showed how little people know about other famous areas of Britain like the Lake District and the Isle of Man.

More than a third of those under 30 thought Land's End was in the north when really it marks the southern-most tip of the country

Nearly one in 10 people believe the Lake District is nearest to Newcastle, while one in five think the Isle of Man is in the English Channel.

A poll of 1,000 people by Virgin Trains found a woeful lack of general knowledge among Britain's young people.

More than a third of those under 30 thought Land's End was in the north when really it marks the westernmost tip of the English mainland.

And a north-south divide really does exist with two in three Londoners unsure about which towns and cities are nearest to the Lake District.

A reliance on modern technology such as Google maps, satellite navigation and internet route finders is being blamed for significant numbers of people having a blinkered view of their country.

Technology such as sat nav, Google maps and route finder websites mean that people can almost point and go these days, without having to know the geography of the country

Social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter also mean that people often keep in touch with friends without travelling to visit them.

The poll quizzed people aged 16 to 60-plus on the location of some famous areas of Britain, how long it took to travel between some cities and typical train journey times.

A total of 45 per cent of people did not know that Carlisle in Cumbria is nearer to the Lake District than Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, Oxford, Leeds and Manchester.

Eight per cent thought it was nearest to Newcastle, five per cent said Oxford and two per cent even said Cardiff in Wales.

Ignorance about the Lake District location was highest among under 30s with 54 per cent not knowing it was nearest to Carlisle.

And Londoners were least knowledgeable about the Lake District with only 34 per cent knowing its location.

Nearly half of those questioned (47 per cent) did not know that Inverness in Scotland was the most northerly city compared to Aberdeen, Cardiff, Portsmouth and Leeds.

That figure rose to 54 per cent among people aged under 30, said Virgin Trains.

A third (33 per cent) of those polled did not know that the Isle of Man was in the Irish Sea, placing it in the English Channel (21 per cent), North Sea (nine per cent) and Atlantic (three per cent).

While 68 per cent correctly said the Jurassic Coast is in Dorset and Devon, 12 per cent placed it in Scotland, seven per cent in Northumberland or north Wales and six per cent in Norfolk.

More than one in five Britons thought Hadrian's Wall divided either Devon and Cornwall, Yorkshire and Lancashire, England and Wales and even north and south London.

A total of 78 per cent correctly said it was nearest to the border between England and Scotland.

While 87 per cent rightly said Land's End was in the south of the UK, 13 per cent said it was in the north, rising to a third of those aged under 30.

More than seven in 10 Brits thought a typical train journey between Manchester and London took between three and five hours, compared to the real time of just over two hours.

Just 21 per cent of people correctly said the train journey time from Oxenholme in the Lake District to London was three hours. Twelve per cent thought the journey was more than five hours.

Six in 10 people did not know that trains can reach speeds of 125mph on journeys between London and Manchester.

Arthur Leathley, communications director of Virgin Trains, said: 'Our research shows that significant numbers of people in Britain are vague about the location of some of our most famous landmarks.

'But technology such as sat nav, Google maps and route finder websites mean that people can almost point and go these days, without having to know the geography of the country.

'In the end, there is no better way of discovering where everywhere is than to get out there and enjoy our great landscape this year.'

Joss Croft, marketing director of tourism group VisitBritain, said: 'Whether it's heading to Liverpool to take in a match at Anfield before visiting an exhibition at the Tate, or wandering the Royal Mile in Edinburgh ahead of dining at one of the city's Michelin starred restaurants, visitors are just a train ride away from discovering all that is great about Britain.'
