The socialite ex-girlfriend of Tommy Gilbert, the trust-fund Princeton graduate believed to have shot dead his father, says she was repeatedly warned that he 'would chop her into tiny pieces'.

Anna Rothschild, 49, dated the 30-year-old aspiring model and actor for four months early last year but broke off the relationship because there was no long-term future.

The socialite, who is not related to the powerful Rothschild banking dynasty, exclusively told the Daily Mail Online that when she first began seeing Tommy, after meeting him at a friend's dinner party, a close friend had called her out of deep concern.

Ms Rothschild said: 'Very soon after going out with him, a mutual friend of ours told me: ''Anna you have to be really careful - Tommy is going to chop you up into little pieces.''

The PR exec and Manhattan socialite (pictured right, with Tommy) said that he had shared his dreams of wanting to become a model with her but a photoshoot had never come to anything

Ms Rothschild dismissed the remarks, thinking her friend was joking and perhaps jealous because Gilbert, a tall, muscled blonde surfing instructor, was so handsome.

'My friend just said he got a really bad vibe off Tommy and thought he was psycho because he never spoke - I just thought it was because he was shy,' she said. 

'He called me up the day after the shooting and said, ''I told you so.'''

Gilbert Jr, was charged with murder on Monday - a day after he allegedly shot dead his 70-year-old father, $200million Wainscott Capital hedge-fund boss Thomas Gilbert Sr, at his Manhattan home.

The father and son, whose $2,400 Chelsea apartment rent was paid for by his parents, had reportedly argued about Tommy's weekly allowance being cut from $400 to $300.

Ms Rothschild, who runs A. Rothschild & Co PR firm, revealed that she began dating Tommy after sitting next to him at a Christmas dinner party at a mutual friend's home in 2013.

She said: 'We were sat next to each other. I had no idea who he was or who his family were. It was hard not to be attracted to someone who is so attractive.'

‘We talked and a day later he called and he asked me out. He was very down-to-earth. He wasn’t a spoiled brat - he was low-key.’

Society queen: Ms Rothschild, 49, broke off her relationship with Gilbert because he was too young for her to have a serious relationship with. She said that he was 'absolutely devastated' when it was over

Ms Rothschild revealed that the pair met again at a friend’s apartment for a New Year’s Eve party. She said: 'He was painfully shy, extremely quiet and introverted but opened up when he knew you.

'He would come over to mine and we would cook or order in. We both loved sushi.' 

She revealed that Gilbert had been working for his father but that the job didn't work out. He then dreamed of being a model and actor but his plans disintegrated because of his lack of confidence.

'He did a photo-shoot once with a photographer but nothing came of it,' Ms Rothschild said. 'I told him acting was not a great idea because he didn’t talk.'

Despite rumors circulating that he was a closet homosexual, his former girlfriend was quick to rubbish them. 

Ms Rothschild, who lives in an apartment on the Upper West Side, said: 'I don’t believe rumors that he was a closet homosexual.'

She also laughed off the image of him as a 'party boy', caught up in the whirlwind of New York's social circuit.  

'It’s absurd to say he was on the social scene. He didn’t drink. He had about four drinks in the four months we dated.' 

She explained that Tommy was devoted to fitness and taught surfing in the Hamptons last summer. 

'He didn’t do drugs. He was against all that,' she said. 'He used to get up every day, really early and go the gym and play tennis. I suspected his drugs arrest in 2007 was probably pot-related but he was past that when I knew him. 

'He was very healthy. He said once a psychiatrist prescribed him meds but he saw a therapist instead of taking them. I never saw any signs of drug taking.'

However she became aware that the 30-year-old, who attended one of Manhattan's most prestigious private schools before going on to Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and then Princeton, had a dark side. 

'I thought he was damaged and that something happened to him in childhood so I started digging. He never talked about his Mom, always about his Dad,' she said. 

Ms Rothschild also said that although his 24-year-old sister Clare lived in Manhattan, he rarely spoke about her.

Twice-divorced Ms Rothschild said she 'delicately' tried to break things off with Tommy in spring 2014 by seeing him less and less frequently.

'I broke it off because I was never going to marry a 29-year-old,' she confessed to Daily Mail Online. 

'It wasn’t right for me. It was absurd that it went on for as long as it did. I started to phase him out. It went from seeing him every other day, to once a week, to me ignoring his texts. 

She added: 'I finally met him for dinner and told him. He looked absolutely devastated, like a kid who had his toy taken away from him.'  

But when she officially tried to end the relationship face-to-face, Ms Rothschild revealed that her younger lover began bombarding her with text messages which she ignored.

In retrospect, Ms Rothschild said today that she felt nothing but relief, adding she may well have been a victim.

'I feel extremely lucky. He kept texting me. I feel so lucky. I feel I could have been one of his victims,' she added.

Soon after the relationship ended, the former PR firm owner left the U.S. for Europe and Turkey where she spent six months  travelling. 

She last saw Tommy in late December when they met as friends for their favorite meal sushi at Upper West Side restaurant Sushi Yasaka.

'I saw him two weeks before the shooting, as friends. We stayed friends,' she said. 'As usual he paid. $150.... He was actually upbeat. He always paid and never mentioned any money problems or his allowance.'

Ms Rothschild also speculated that Gilbert may 'have been on meds and came off them' when he fatally shot his father.   

Gilbert was also charged with 21 counts of criminal possession of forgery devices after skimming device and 21 blank credit cards found at his home on Sunday. 

'I've cut ties now,' she added: 'I wouldn’t be surprised if he tried to contact me but I won’t have anything to do with him now.' 

The accused killer's former girlfriend said that he didn't talk much about his mom Shelley (left) or sister Clare (right) but mostly about his father
