A woman who ended up driving into the ocean while her three young children were strapped in the back of the family minivan, says it was low blood sugar that led to her making a potentially catastrophic decision.

Ebony Wilkerson, 32, from South Carolina woman is accused of trying to kill her three children by driving them into the Atlantic Ocean in her car.

She has said that she was severely disoriented due to low blood sugar at the time in a motion filed by an attorney representing her.

The mother was 28 weeks pregnant when she drove her minivan with her three children inside into the ocean

Ebony 
Wilkerson's blood sugar level was measured at 44 by paramedics called to
 the beach March 4. Assistant Public Defender Craig Dyer says a normal 
range would be from 70 to 100.

Records related to Wilkerson's blood sugar are expected to be discussed during a hearing Friday.

Her attorneys had previously suggested that they may seek an insanity defence.

The judge 
will also consider whether Wilkerson violated terms of her pretrial 
release by testing positive for alcohol in an August 6 urinalysis.

The Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, woman is charged with three counts each of attempted murder and child abuse.

Tourists on the beach caught the incident on camera and rushed to rescue the three children from the vehicle

Witnesses described Wilkerson hopping out of the car window as her screaming children remained seat-belted in the back

Wilkerson who was pregnant 
at the time of the incident is accused of deliberately driving her minivan into the ocean
 to kill her three children. She has since given birth to her fourth child.

Bystanders and officers helped pull her and her children — ages 3, 9 and 10 — from their car as it was almost submerged.

Tourists on the beach caught the horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that the mother was physically able to escape the vehicle.

In video taken by Simon Besner, a tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards try to pull her children from inside the vehicle.

Witnesses described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children remained seat-belted in the back as waves nearly pushed her under the van.

Wilkerson was stopped in her vehicle by police officers two hours before she drove into the ocean.

Her sister called police worried since Wilkerson had been talking about demons.

The officers found her lucid and let her go.
