A motorist with poor eyesight who killed a pedestrian while not wearing glasses walked free from court yesterday.

A judge said Mohammed Rashid, who ploughed into journalist Laurence Gunn  on a pedestrian crossing, had  not done anything illegal by failing to wear his glasses.

The former law student is so short-sighted he could only read a registration plate seven feet away when police tested him.

Laurence Gunn, 32, left, died after he was hit by a Ford Focus driven by Mohammed Rashid, 23.  Short-sighted Rashid, who admitted he wasn't wearing his glasses, was sentenced to just 140' hours community service

Mr Gunn was crossing the road in Hampstead, north London, with his dog, Misty, when he was hit by the car

But he received just 140 hours of community service for hitting Mr Gunn with his Ford Focus in March last year.

Mr Gunn, 32, was hurled into the air as he crossed the road with a friend. He died of his injuries the following day.

Rashid, 23, admitted to police that he had not worn his glasses for more than a year and didn’t know where they were.

However,
 sentencing him at Blackfriars Crown Court, Judge Aidan Marron QC said 
that while Rashid should have been more ‘prudent’, he had not broken the
 law by not wearing them.

Mr Gunn, from Maida Vale, north west London, had been walking on Hampstead Heath with a friend

He
 called the case ‘an unmitigated tragedy’, adding: ‘I’m afraid you were 
the cause of the death. You were driving at a reasonable speed and the 
evidence suggests there was nothing unusual on the road surface.

‘I
 suggest we will never know why you did not see the victim. It would 
have been desirable and prudent to wear specs. But there is nothing 
unlawful about that.’

Rashid
 denied causing death by dangerous driving at his trial in October, but 
pleaded guilty  to the lesser charge of causing death by careless 
driving.

Judge Marron added: ‘You have made it perfectly clear from the outset that you are remorseful.

‘The only possible aggravating factor is the specs, and in evidence we heard they were not a legal requirement.’

He
 sentenced Rashid to 140 hours’ unpaid work, a 12-month driving ban and 
eight points on his licence. He also ordered him to pay £500 in costs.

Rashid's lawyer told the judge at Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, that the incident had 'freaked him out'

His barrister, Jacqueline Vallejo, told the court Rashid was deeply affected by the incident.

She said in mitigation: ‘Mr Rashid is not the same man as before, and for all intents and purposes he is a good lad.

‘Mr Rashid has left the University of East London in his second year, where he was studying law.

‘The
 incident freaked him out and he is now working full time at 
Sainsbury’s, but wants to start university again in September. But there
 is no longer any hope of pursuing a career in law.’

The court heard Rashid had met his victim’s father.

Miss
 Vallejo said: ‘Mr Gunn’s father asked to meet with my  client and they 
spoke for half an hour, and Mr Gunn bears no grudges. He is a dignified 
but aggrieved man.’

Rashid was ordered to have 12 more meetings with Mr Gunn’s family as part of a restorative justice programme.

Mr
 Gunn, who lived in Maida Vale in north-west London, and his friend 
Marsha Peterson had visited two pubs in Hampstead, North London, and 
walked their dogs on Hampstead Heath on the day of the incident.

They were on East Heath Road at 7pm when Rashid hit Mr Gunn as he and his dog Misty were using the crossing.

Rashid
 was not over the speed limit and had not been drinking. While it was 
dark, the road was brightly lit, with a well-marked pedestrian crossing.
