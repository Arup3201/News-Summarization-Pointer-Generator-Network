British space scientists are using medieval stained-glass to build a 'state of the art' camera bound for Mars.

The space team are using the medieval technology to ensure pictures beamed back from Mars accurately show the colours found on the Red Planet.

Scientists have been struggling to see what the surface of Mars looks like because the high ultra violet radiation in the atmosphere causes colours to fade.

But researchers have now taken divine inspiration from medieval stained-glass - because their colours haven't faded after hundreds of years being bombarded by UV radiation.

Although medieval glass artisans didn't know they were using it, nanotechnology played a key part in creating stained-glass windows.

Medieval stained-glass was created by trapping gold nanoparticles in the 'glass matrix' to create a red colour. Silver nanoparticles, meanwhile, gave it a deep yellow colour.

Professor Dave Barnes, based at Aberystwyth University, said: 'Mars has little to no ozone in the atmosphere and this means that the high ultra violet radiation can cause colours to fade when exposed to sunlight.

Although medieval artisans didn't know they were using it, nanotechnology played a key part in creating stained-glass windows.

Medieval stained-glass was created by trapping gold nanoparticles in the 'glass matrix' to create a red colour. Silver nanoparticles, meanwhile, gave it a deep yellow colour.

This meant that it would never fade, despite sitting in sunlit windows for hundreds of years.

Similar stained-glass will be used in a robotic camera during the European Space Agency's ExoMars Rover mission to the Red Planet in 2019.

The colour centres in the Rover's camera are formed as a nano-particle suspension within the glass and this acts as an efficient UV blocker.

'The stained-glass idea comes from observing the many stained-glass windows in churches - many of which date back to medieval times.

'These have been exposed to sunlight for centuries and show little to no colour degradation.'

The stained-glass will be used in a robotic camera during the European Space Agency's ExoMars Rover mission to the Red Planet in 2019.

The 350kg rover's mission will be to scour the surface of Mars for signs of past or present life.

It will have a drill to pull samples up from 2m down, and scientific instruments to assess any organic chemistry that might be present.

A team of scientists from Aberystwyth University in West Wales have created the 3D Panoramic Camera Instrument (PanCam) and the medieval stained-glass it will use.

Professor Barnes said: 'Scientists want the images from Mars to be colour corrected - as if they were being viewed by a human - to help identify scientific targets.

The small stained-glass coloured chips measure just 50 mm W 50 mm, are 18 mm high and weigh no more than 25 grams. Space scientists are using medieval stained-glass inside a camera being sent on a mission to Mars. Pictured here is the glass which is to be used in the camera

'I have colleagues at Aberystwyth who specialise in glass research and when they heard we needed stable coloured targets for the calibration target they said use stained-glass.

'The colour centres are formed as a nano-particle suspension within the glass and this acts as an efficient UV blocker.

'This prevents chemical reactions from occurring that will change the colours.'

The small stained-glass coloured chips measure just 50 mm W 50 mm, are 18 mm high and weigh no more than 25 grams.

They were made using traditional medieval processes developed hundreds of years ago.

Professor Barnes said: 'We had to go back to some old chemistry "recipe" books to find out these traditional methods.

The 3D PanCam will be the science 'eyes' for Esa's Mars rover mission in 2019 and will feature a novel colour correction system to ensure that images sent back to earth truly represent the colours on Mars

'A lot of trial and error has gone into perfecting the process and I'm pretty sure stained-glass has never been used on any Mars mission before.'

The 3D PanCam will be the science 'eyes' for the Mars rover mission and will feature a novel colour correction system to ensure that images sent back to earth truly represent the colours on Mars.

The camera and stained-glass chips are currently being tested in Chile's Atacama desert where Daniel Craig filmed the climax to his second outing as James Bond.

The field trials are being held around the the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Hotel at Cerro Paranal - used as the Bond villain's lair in Quantum of Solace - because the barren desert replicates the rocky red surface of Mars.

The Aberystwyth team will be responsible for processing the images taken by PanCam during mission using a variety of computer vision techniques and algorithms they have developed.
