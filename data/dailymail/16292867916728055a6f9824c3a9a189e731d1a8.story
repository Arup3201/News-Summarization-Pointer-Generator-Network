Thibaut CourtoisClub: Chelsea Position: Goalkeeper

Chelsea snapped up the young keeper from Genk and immediately sent him on loan to Atletico Madrid, where he replaced David de Gea. He impressed in the Spanish capital, helping Diego Simeone's side to the La Liga title and Champions League final.

Courtois returns to Chelsea this summer ready to fight Petr Cech for the No 1 jersey.

Big stage: Thibaut Courtois helped Atletico Madrid to the La Liga title and Champions League final

Rising high: Courtois has only conceded one goal at the World Cup so far

Vincent KompanyClub: Manchester City Position: Defender

In 2012, the Belgian defender helped Manchester City to their first top-flight title since 1968 and then lifted the Premier League trophy once again this year. Since moving to the Etihad in 2008 from Hamburg he has established himself as one of the best defenders in Europe.

The Belgium captain, along with Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen, is a doubt for the game due to injury, meaning that Daniel van Buyten and Nicolas Lombarts could start in the centre of defence.

Reputation: Kompany has become one of the best central defenders in Europe

Jan VertonghenClub: Tottenham Hotspur Position: Defender

Andre Villas-Boas splashed £10m on the 25-year-old from Ajax in 2012. Vertonghen's stock rose while at the Amsterdam ArenA in 2009-10 under Martin Jol. He has won 57 caps for the national team and formed a good pairing with Kompany.

The Tottenham defender scored the goal that sealed top spot in Group H for Belgium in a 1-0 win over South Korea.

Contribution: Vertonghen moved to Tottenham in 2012 for £10million

Toby AlderweireldClub: Atletico Madrid Position: Defender

Another player who started his career at the Dutch giants Ajax and is known for his strength on the ball and long range passing ability. He was courted by Premier League clubs but switched to La Liga in a £6.1m move to Atletico Madrid and was a regular in Diego Simeone's title-winning side.

Solid: Right back Toby Alderweireld was a regular fit in Atletico Madrid's title-winning team

Daniel van BuytenClub: Bayern Munich Position: Defender

Son of a popular Belgian wrestler from the 1960s, Van Buyten has played all over Europe - including a loan spell at Manchester City. Now at Bayern Munich the defender is an established member of the Belgian squad winning 83 caps.

Veteran: 36-year-old Daniel van Buyten has made 83 appearances for Belgium

Kevin MirallasClub: Everton Position: Midfielder

David Moyes splashed £6m on the forward from Olympiacos and he scored six goals in his debut Premier League season in 2012-13. Despite playing 45 times for Belgium, Mirallas is of Spanish decent and played his formative years in France with Lille.

Roar: Kevin Mirallas celebrates with Divock Origi after the substitute's winner against Russia at the Maracana

Dynamic: Mirallas has added life to Everton's attack with his pace and goal threat

Eden HazardClub: Chelsea Position: Midfielder

The midfielder was one of the most wanted players in Europe last summer, with Manchester United and Manchester City both vying for his signature.

But it was Chelsea who won the race and Hazard linked up with Oscar and Juan Mata and stood out in his first season in the Premier League.

Since Mata moved on to Old Trafford, Hazard has become the main man at Stamford Bridge with his creativity and trickery.

Star: Eden Hazard has become the main man at Chelsea, and he is of similar importance to Belgium

World class: Hazard's creativity and vision have made him one of the best players in the Premier League

VIDEO USA will see a better Eden - Hazard

Marouane FellainiClub: Manchester United Position: Midfielder

A deadline day move to Manchester United reunited the 25-year-old with David Moyes. Fellaini's first season at Old Trafford didn't go according to plan, but he is still a key player for his country, and proved his worth with a crucial goal in their 2-1 win over Algeria in Group H.

Crucial: Marouane Fellaini scored a vital equaliser against Algeria before Belgium went on to win 2-1

Disappointing: Fellaini's first season at Manchester United since moving from Everton didn't go to plan

Mousa DembeleClub: Tottenham Hotspur Position: Midfielder

Fulham brought Dembele to the Premier 
League and in his two seasons at Craven Cottage did enough to convince 
Spurs to splash £15m on the playmaker last summer. A good turn of pace 
and has the ability to beat players at ease.

Elusive: Dembele is a dangerous threat in the final third and will look to exploit any gaps

Axel WitselClub: Zenit St Petersburg Position: Midfielder

Witsel is another member of the successful Belgian squad to move for a big transfer fee, when he went from Benfica to Zenit St Petersburg last summer. He won a number of individual awards while playing for Standard Liege in his early years.

Valued: Axel Witsel moved to Zenit St Petersburg from Benfica for a big transfer fee

Nacer ChadliClub: Tottenham Hotspur Position: Midfielder

Spurs added to their Belgian contingent when they signed Chadli for £7m from FC Twente last summer. He is a versatile player who can play as a second striker and out on the wing. Opted to play for Belgium despite holding dual citizenship with Morocco.

Kevin De BruyneClub: Wolfsburg Position: Attacking Midfielder

De Bruyne joined Chelsea from Genk and was sent on loan to Werder Bremen. After an impressive pre-season, De Bruyne looked like was going to be part of Jose Mourinho's plans at Stamford Bridge.

But after a strong start to the season, his playing time soon dried up and he was sold to Wolfsburg for £18million in January.

Dries MertensClub: Napoli Position: Attacking Midfielder

Mertens
 came off the bench to score a crucial goal for Belgium in their opening
 game, the winner against Algeria in the 80th minute.

Mertens plays his club football for Rafael Benitez's Napoli, and is a winger capable of troubling even the best defender.

Decisive: Dries Mertens came off the bench to score the winner against Algeria in Belgium's opening game

Adnan JanuzajClub: Manchester United Position: Winger

Still a fringe player for Belgium due to their plethora of attacking options, but Januzaj was one of the few positives for Manchester United last season.

The 19-year-old burst into the limelight with a second-half brace against Sunderland last October, helping David Moyes's side recover from their first-half deficit to claim three points.

Fringe: Adnan Januzaj only featured in one of Belgium's group games, against South Korea

Moment: Januzaj shot to prominence with his second-half double against Sunderland last October

Divock OrigiClub: Lille Position: Forward

The 19-year-old has only made five international appearances, but he has already made his mark for Belgium. Origi came off the bench to score the winner against Russia at the Maracana in the 88th minute.

Origi plays his club football for Lille in France, but could be on his way to the Premier League wth Liverpool leading the interest.

Making his mark: Divock Origi smashes home a late winner against Russia at the Maracana

Romelu LukakuClub: Chelsea Position: Striker

Ever since Christian Benteke was ruled out of the World Cup, the Chelsea forward has had a bigger role to play.

While Jose Mourinho may not see eye to eye with him, sending the striker on loan to Everton last season, Lukaku provides Belgium with an aerial threat and, for a man his size, surprising skill.
