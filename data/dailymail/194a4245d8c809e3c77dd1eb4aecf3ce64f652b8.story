Claim: Jeremiah Adebolajo says he was approached in Saudi Arabia after his brother Michael had been arrested in Kenya (pictured) trying to get to Somalia to fight for rebels

British spies approached the brother of Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo more than ten times to convince him to work for the security services, it emerged today.

Jeremiah Adebolajo said MI5 and MI6 'harassed' him and tried to press him for details about his family before putting him on a 'no-fly list' when he refused.

The 26-year-old was first approached in 2011 when he moved to Saudi Arabia to teach English at the University of Ha'il, in NeJd.

He held 11 meetings with both MI5 and MI6, both in the Gulf and also in the UK, including on one occasion where he was intercepted as he got off a flight at Heathrow.

As well as asking questions about his brother Michael, 28, spies had also pressed him on  his brother-in-law, James Thompson, who had converted to Islam and married his sister.

They also asked him to identify other men who had gone to the Yemen and may have been plotting to attack Britain, but he said he didn't know them.

Previously it had been alleged that Jeremiah was paid thousands of pounds by MI6 as part of spying operations in the Middle East, and was allowed to fly first-class and stay in five-star hotels.

This was revealed in a document allegedly written by Jeremiah’s sister, Blessing Adebolajo, 32, which was seen earlier this month.

It was also alleged he was also asked to help ‘turn’ his brother, Michael, to work for MI5, who were already aware of Michael’s close links to extremist groups after he was arrested on his way to Somalia to join terror group Al-Shabaab.

Complaint: A redacted copy of the allegations made by the Adebolajo family about the approaches made by the security services. Jeremiah said this account as untrue

'That’s not true in any way.  I mean it’s completely false.  I can 
understand what it’s based on, them approaching me while I was in Saudi 
Arabia, but the claim I worked for them helped them or co-operated with 
them in any way is false,' Jeremiah Adebolajo told ITV News.

'I felt harassed. I felt there was no choice but to meet them whenever 
they wanted to meet me to speak to them whenever they wanted to speak to
 me...Their claim was that I had been in contact with, spoken with, met 
in my time in England with people who they were interested in.'

Government sources have already confirmed that Michael Adebolajo was known to MI5. It was alleged that he rebuffed efforts by the security service to recruit him as a spy.

Older sister: Blessing Adebolajo had allegedly said her brother Jeremiah was approached by MI6 and asked to become an informant

Jeremiah may have been seen as the ideal way to change his mind and said last night that they tried hard to influence him.

'I would say that their approach wasn’t so much aggressive as it was threatening. I mean there were implicit threats made towards my welfare towards my time in Saudi Arabia, whether I would be able to retain my job, um, so in short I’d say their approach was worrying somewhat,' he said.

Speaking about how often they met, both in the UK and Saudi Arabia, he said: 'I’d say they were about at the beginning, they were you know, at least once a month and over the two years they lessened somewhat, but they would be at unexpected times and I would say once every two to three months, yeah.'

When asked about the execution of Lee Rigby and the alleged link to his brother Michael and Michael Adebowale, 22, he said: 'Legally I can’t speak about it.'
