Andy Carroll scored twice on Sunday afternoon to send West Ham into the Premier League’s top three before declaring: ‘I’m back.’

The striker moved on from his latest injury nightmare with a brilliant performance and two leaping headers as West Ham crushed Swansea 3-1 at Upton Park.

And after ending a 797-minute wait for a goal, the 25-year-old, who was playing only his fifth game following ankle surgery in the summer, said: ‘It means a lot to me to get back on the score sheet.

The England striker, who has spent most of the year sidelined through injury, jumps for joy after scoring

‘I've played a couple of games and I'm back, but until you score you don't feel like you are definitely back. But now I've scored I am definitely back.

‘It is a great feeling. It is fantastic to be back on the pitch and playing as many games as I have in the last few weeks. 

'There is nothing better than scoring goals as a striker, so I was desperate to get a goal and it is great feeling.

‘You always have to just think about the positives (when injured). The medical staff have helped me a lot and it is credit to them that I am back.’

The result takes West Ham into the top three for the first time since 1999, albeit only until tonight when they will be overtaken by either Southampton or Manchester United, who meet at St Mary’s.

West Ham fell behind to Wilfried Bony’s 19th-minute goal, but levelled through a Carroll header four minutes before the break. Carroll headed a second and then assisted substitute Diafra Sakho for a late third shortly after Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski had been sent off for fouling the striker.

Manager Sam Allardyce has now overseen three wins in a row. He said: ‘I hope we can stay this consistent. 

‘We deserved to win and won playing good attacking football.’

Asked if it was Carroll’s best performance for West Ham, Allardyce added: ‘I have to say it was close to it. When he scores two you have to say yes. 

'We thought about taking him off after the second but let him try to get the hat-trick.’

Swansea manager Garry Monk was furious with his side’s performance, but indicated he will appeal the decision to send off Fabianski as he claimed Sakho handballed before being brought down by Fabianski outside the area. He also contested whether it was a goal-scoring opportunity.

Swansea boss Garry Monk was unhappy with his side's performance in the 3-1 defeat at West Ham defeat

He said: ‘Look at the build-up - Sakho knocks it past with his hand clearly. 

'Realistically it should have been handball to us and it wasn't a clear goalscoring opportunity from the way it played out so when you look at it, it suggests it wasn't.

'You'd think we would appeal when you have the benefit of the replays.'

Monk added: ‘We didn’t reach the levels we can play – that is the first time I can say that this season.

‘Some of the defending, we gifted it on a plate really. We could have done better with the first goal - a good header - but he (Carroll) lost his man marker for the second which is unacceptable. 

'The third was bad defending. We can’t give them an early Christmas present.’
