John Hodson had been a postman for eight years but stole to try to repay his debts of £50,000

A thieving postman is facing jail for hoarding nearly 75,000 letters and parcels in his shed because he was 'too lazy' to deliver them.

John Hodson, 33, who had debts of £50,000, targeted envelopes with gift cards and stole the contents.

The father-of-two was caught out after a Royal Mail investigation planted two parcels with tracking devices.

One of the parcels contained a £30 voucher, which Hodson was seen spending on tracksuit bottoms by a shop CCTV camera.

He admitted theft and intentionally delaying the mail between November 2006 and April this year, and will be sentenced by Manchester magistrates next month.

Royal Mail launched its surveillance operation in March after complaints of 58 greetings cards going missing in the Prestwich area.

Hodson, who had been a postman for eight years, was rumbled by the tracking devices which showed the postal service's two planted parcels were in his car.

Prosecutor Elizabeth Rigby told the court how Hodson was found to have £140 stolen from packages when he was apprehended.

His car also contained an empty gift card wallet, other gift card packets and a 20 dollar bill.

A search of his house found the tracksuit bottoms he had bought with the planted voucher, as well as 65 DVDs and 269 greetings-type packages.

Investigators found junk mail in bundles and boxes with more stolen items in the kitchen bin.

The guilty postman hoarded the packages so as to not draw attention to himself.

He said his behaviour was 'despicable' and that he had stolen the cash to repay debts.

Mrs Rigby said: 'He estimated he had had between £400-600 but later said he didn’t know how much he had taken.'

Michael Cahill, defending, said Hodson, of Chudleigh Road, Crumpsall, Greater Manchester, had never previously been in trouble.

He had got into ‘an enormous amount of debt’ exceeding £50,000 with credit cards and loans.

Mr Cahill said: 'He was living beyond his means and everything spiralled out of control.'
