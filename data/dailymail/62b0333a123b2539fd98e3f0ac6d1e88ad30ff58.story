Following the announcement of Suarez’s suspension on Thursday afternoon, senior Adidas officials were engaged in an emergency to meeting to decide their position on the controversial striker.

A statement
 read: ‘Adidas fully supports FIFA’s decision. Adidas certainly does not
 condone Luis Suarez’s recent behaviour and we will again be reminding 
him of the high standards we expect from our players.

We
 have no plan to use Suarez for any additional marketing activities 
during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. We will discuss all aspects of our 
future partnership directly with Suarez and his team following the World
 Cup.’

FIFA are Adidas’ longest-serving partners, with a relationship that began in 1970 and was last year extended until 2030.

It
 is anticipated that they may come under pressure to support the stance 
of the world governing body over that of their client Suarez and some 
will feel that Adidas must drop him entirely from their marketing 
campaigns.

Adidas
 are one of several sponsors concerned with the image that Suarez’s 
actions promote and Sportsmail understands that Liverpool’s major shirt 
sponsors Standard Chartered are also set to add their voice to the 
debate later this afternoon.

In
 an address earlier this year, managing director Ian Ayre spoke at 
length in front a watching audience – including Peter Sands, the group 
chief executive of Standard Chartered PLC - at the bank's London 
headquarters, where he praised the work of sports’ psychologist Steve 
Peters with improving Suarez’s on field conduct with the Merseyside 
club.

Liverpool’s
 kit manufacturer Warrior Football have also declined to comment at this
 moment in time but it is understood that their position is being 
reviewed internally.

Betting firm 888 Poker warned on Wednesday that they were seriously reviewing their relationship with Suarez.

Liverpool
 managing director Ian Ayre has issued the following statement:  
‘Liverpool Football Club will wait until we have seen and had time to 
review the FIFA Disciplinary Committee report before making any further 
comment.’

Standard Chartered officials (Liverpool’s shirt sponsor) deliberated on Thursday afternoon and issued the following statement: ‘It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this stage, until the club has received and reviewed FIFA’s report.’

Sportsmail understands that that they will outline their position more clearly in the coming days.
