A teenager has suffered a social media backlash after taking a selfie at Auschwitz. 

Breanna Mitchell, who is thought to be an American who recently graduated high school, uploaded the controversial image on Twitter with the message: 'Selfie in the Auschwitz Concentration Camp', followed by a blushing smiley face symbol.

The photo has been retweeted more than 3,000 times alongside hundreds of messages of criticism. 

Backlash: Breanna Mitchell has received hundreds of messages of criticism after taking this selfie at Auschwitz, Nazi Germany's biggest concentration camp

But she seems to have taken the unexpected fame in her stride by sharing a news article condemning her actions with the message, 'I'm famous yall.' 

Originally, Mitchell said she wished people would stop tweeting about the photo.

She said: 'Omg I wish people would quit tweeting to, quoting, retweeting, and favoriting my picture of my smiling in Auschwitz Concentration Camp. Like apparently is such a big deal that I smiled. Good Lord.'

However she then said: 'Over 2,000 retweets on a pic that wasn't supposed to get this much attention.'

As the image spread, she shared an article by Business Insider  criticising her actions with her followers.

Mitchell claims she took the photo after studying the Holocaust for years with her father, who died a year ago. 

She said: 'That trip actually meant something to me and I was happy about it,' she tweeted, explaining the reasoning behind the smiling selfie.'

The teenager has also retweeted 150 people who have supported her reason for taking the image.  

The complex, which consists of two areas - Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau - was originally used to house Polish political prisoners.

But from spring 1942, it became the largest concentration camp operated by the Third Reich. More than 1,100,000 men, women, and children lost their lives there 

According to the museum’s website, visitors are allowed to take pictures on the grounds – with the exception of a hall that contains the hair of victims, the basements of Block 11 and the gas chamber.

The camp in Nazi-occupied Poland has become a symbol of terror and genocide around the world. More than 1,100,000 men, women, and children lost their lives there

It was set up in 1940. Its first purpose was to house the increasing number of Polish prisoners arrested by Hitler's forces.

But in 1942 it became the largest death camp operated by the Third Reich, with Jews, gypsies and Soviet prisoners of war also being sent.

At the height of its operation, there were three main camps with thousands of prisoners in each. 

Inmates were subjected to inhumane conditions with no food or sanitation. Many were victims of brutal medical experiments or died in gas chambers. 

As the Soviet forces approached Auschwitz in January 1945, most of its population was evacuated and sent on a 'death march'. The small number who survived were liberated. 

In the course of the war, the camp was staffed by 6,500 to 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), approximately 15 per cent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. 

Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. 

The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at the camp, and their failure to bomb the camp or its railways remains controversial.
