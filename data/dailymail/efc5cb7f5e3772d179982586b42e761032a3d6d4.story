West Brom legend Tony Brown has been recognised for his 20-years of service to the club with the unveiling of a bronze sculpture at The Hawthorns on Thursday.

Brown, 69, is still a regular visitor, working as a co-commentator on local radio. He will be able to walk past his statue, outside the East Stand, on the way to work on match days.

Sportsmail gives you five things about the midfielder they call Bomber.

1. Tony ‘Bomber’ Brown, born in Oldham in 1945 and brought up in Manchester, snubbed Manchester City to join West Bromwich Albion at the age of 15 after accepting the offer of a trial. He recalled: ‘The very first time I stepped foot inside The Hawthorns I knew this was the club for me. At the time I was on the verge of signing for Manchester City, who were my local club, but I felt so instantly at home with Albion that I decided to sign for them instead. It was the best decision I’ve ever made in my life.’

2. Bomber scored a club record 279 goals in a club-record 720 competitive matches between 1963 and 1980 despite the fact he was a midfielder. Team-mate Cyrille Regis, in his autobiography, wrote: ‘Tony Brown was the best attacking midfielder I ever played with. You look at his record - to score over 200 goals from midfield is astonishing. Tony Brown was immensely loyal to West Brom - and the best player I ever saw running on to the ball and into the box. The best. He was scarily talented.’

3. In 1971, Bomber finished top scorer of the old First Division. His 28-League goal tally left the likes of Allan ‘Sniffer’ Clarke and Tottenham’s Martin Chivers in his wake. West Brom only finished 17th that season and scored 58 goals in total, putting Bomber’s feat into even more perpective. It also earned him his one England cap - a goalless draw against Wales at Wembley.

4. The Brown trophy cabinet holds an FA Cup winners’ medal from 1968 and a League Cup gong from 1966. Brown scored in the FA Cup semi-final win over Birmingham which secured a trip to Wembley where the late Jeff Astle scored the only goal of the game to beat Everton. The League Cup was the last two-legged final with Albion beating West Ham 5-3 on aggregate, thanks to a 4-1 win at The Hawthorns, one of the goals coming from Bomber.

5. When Bomber finally left The Hawthorns in 1980, he enjoyed three more seasons, playing first for the New England Tea Men in the United States and then Torquay and Stafford back in England. He never stopped scoring goals - 11 in 41 games for Torquay and three in 11 for Stafford.
