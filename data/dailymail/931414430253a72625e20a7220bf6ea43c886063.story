 

Juventus head coach Massimiliano Allegri has revealed he plans to deploy Paul Pogba in a more advanced role this season.

The French midfielder has mainly been used in an orthodox central role since joining Juve two years ago but Allegri wants to push him further forward to utilise his attacking talents better.

'I will try to use Pogba more in attack,' Allegri said in Indonesia on the Italian club's pre-season tour.

Middle man: Pogba is considered to be among the best midfielder in world football

'He is one of the best young players in the world, with enormous technical and physical qualities. Having said that, there is also still plenty of room for improvement.'

Pogba joined Juventus from Manchester United two years ago and has scored 14 goals in 88 games in Italy, establishing himself as one of the best midfielders in Europe.

He has been consistently linked with a move back to United or to Chelsea, while his team-mate and fellow midfielder Arturo Vidal has also been targeted by the Old Trafford club.

Staying put: Allegri also insisted that Vidal (centre) would not be leaving Juventus this summer

But Allegri - who took over at Juve after Antonio Conte resigned last month - was quick to dismiss any suggestions that either of the pair may leave this summer.

He said: 'Vidal and Pogba are delighted to be here and I am delighted to coach them.'
