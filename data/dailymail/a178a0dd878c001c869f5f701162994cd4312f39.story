As war memorial services across the country 
promise never to forget the soldiers who fought in the First World War, 
new research has revealed millions of people have no knowledge of what 
their ancestors did.

An 
estimated 7.5million Britons are in the dark about their military 
heritage, the report by family history website Ancestry.co.uk found.

It
 means an estimated 1,260,000 men who fought in the trenches, at sea or 
in the air have been ‘forgotten’ by their descendants.

According
 to the report, most people assume if their relatives fought in the war 
they would have been told about them, however many veterans never spoke 
to their children about their role in the conflict, wanting to put the 
trauma they experienced in the trenches behind them.

Many Britons said their grandparents died before they could ask them about their wartime experiences.

Miriam
 Silverman, of Ancestry.co.uk, said: ‘Many veterans never spoke about 
their experiences in the Great War upon returning home, so it’s 
understandable how so much knowledge could have been lost, especially if
 people missed the opportunity to speak to their older relatives before 
they died.

‘The result is a widespread and tragic lack of personal knowledge of our WWI ancestry.’

Despite
 this around half of people who knew of their ancestor’s military 
service said they are more grateful for what they have today and a 
similar number feel humbled when they think about their ancestor’s 
bravery.

The number of 
people visiting the 2,400 British First World War cemeteries in France 
and Belgium has never been higher, according to the Commonwealth War 
Graves Commission (CWGC).

Tyne Cot cemetery - the largest British First World War cemetery - has already had 350,000 visitors this year

Peter
 Francis, spokesman for the commission, told The Independent: ‘Four or 
five years ago we estimated the number of visitors each year to the Tyne
 Cot cemetery at Passchendaele - the largest British First World War 
cemetery - at 200,000 to 250,000 people a year.

‘This year we have already had 350,000 visitors. The numbers have been on a rising gradient year after year.’

While
 the report suggests ancestors are being ‘forgotten’, the CWGC’s website
 is reaching visitor numbers of around 10 to one in favour of soldiers 
who died in the First World War.

This
 is explained by the fact the number of soldiers that died between 1914 
and 1918 – almost 800,000 – was more than in 1939 to 1945.

And with each passing generation increases the number of people who had an ancestor in the First World War.

In
 a bid to help Britons uncover their veteran ancestors the family 
history website is making its First World War Medal Index Cards 
available and free to use.

Ms
 Silverman added: ‘We believe all those who served in WWI deserve 
remembering and want to help bridge this knowledge gap. That’s why we’ve
 made all of our WWI medal records universally available.

‘We
 hope that this will allow millions of Britons to reconnect with their 
past and feel the pride that so many of us have for our war hero 
ancestors.’

More than 20 
million WWI records are available online, including the British Army 
World War One Medal Rolls Index Cards, 1914-1920.

This extensive listing of soldiers who served in the First World War will be free to use until the end of the year.

Also
 included on the site are the British Army World War One Service and 
Pension Records, 1914 - 1920, Citations of the Distinguished Conduct 
Medal, 1914-1920, and the National Roll of the Great War.

The
 site has also digitised the Commonwealth War Graves 1914-1921, which 
list details and images of fallen World War One soldiers’ graves.
