Myra Hindley's crimes so shocked the nation that they became the benchmark by which other acts of evil were measured.

But behind bars the Moors Murderer set about a rigorous course of self-improvement, secret files reveal.

She wanted to transform herself from a ‘brassy blonde’ to an ‘intelligent, well- educated woman with middle-class values’.

She took up hobbies including badminton and making tapestries, ‘threw herself with enthusiasm into the choir’ and won a music prize for a love song.

Prison papers describe the child killer as an ‘extremely meticulous person ... even obsessive’, with one governor  noting: ‘Her room is always tidy and very clean.'

But prison officials continued to regard Hindley suspiciously as an ‘arch- manipulator’ and a ‘scheming woman’ who was ‘cold and calculating’, ‘devoid  of emotion’ and should not be trusted, the files show.

With her lover and partner in crime Ian Brady, Hindley was responsible for the murders of five children in the 1960s.

They were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured and buried on Saddleworth Moor near Manchester.

Hindley died in 2002 aged 60 and her confidential files were supposed to have remained secret for another 50 years.

But they have been released early to the national archives owing to the huge interest in her life. Tom Clark, a Sheffield University lecturer, has spent three years studying them.

The boxes of typed reports and handwritten notes fill more than 30ft of shelf space and give a unique picture of Hindley as seen through the eyes of fellow prisoners, welfare workers, probation officers, warders and chaplains.

Hindley became a practising Roman Catholic and dedicated student, earning an Open University degree in Humanities.

‘Myra Hindley is a young woman of superior intellect and academic ability,’ wrote one observer.

And her ability to soak up information was undoubtedly aided by an amazing gift. She has ‘almost total recall of the spoken and written word’, said one assessment.

Her tutor recalled how she sat O-level German and once out of the examination room ‘wrote the entire paper out again from memory so that I could go through it and assess her chances’.

Hindley was jailed for life in May 1966 for the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, ten, and Edward Evans, 17, plus being accessory to the murder of 12-year-old John Kilbride by Brady. In 1987 Hindley and Brady confessed to murdering Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12.

Despite her criminal notoriety she had a ‘very conscientious’ attitude towards her jobs in jail and was put in charge of the kitchen on E wing at Holloway Prison in North London. Her  view that she was better than her fellow inmates quickly became obvious.

‘Myra is fundamentally a very arrogant woman and considers herself superior to the other members of her wing,’ said a 1968 report. She revelled in her celebrity status and put herself as being among the ‘elite’ lifers. For Christmas dinner in 1969 she and another lifer refused to join the others ‘through feelings of superiority’.

And ten years into her sentence it was noted after a routine cell change how she would gather several ‘sycophants who will do all the cleaning, fetching and carrying she has become accustomed to’.

However, most of the time she got on well with fellow inmates, despite her reputation.

‘Women have confessed their horror on learning they were to join a wing with Myra on it, only to admit later what a pleasant and easy woman she was to get on with.’

One prisoner subjected to an unprovoked attack while serving tea wrote to the governor to  praise Hindley.

‘I owed a special thanks to inmate M Hindley who literally threw herself between the attacker and myself whilst I was being kicked,’ she said.

‘Due to this unselfish assistance she suffered blows and kicks that were meant for me.’

As far back as 1974 the prison governor, who had hour-long monthly chats with Hindley, was sufficiently impressed to suggest  a ‘target date’ be set so that  ‘parole should be a practical possibility’.

By 1977 Hindley’s obsession with course work – tackling subjects as diverse as The Age of Revolution, the 19th Century novel and its legacy, and 20th Century poetry – meant she put on weight through lack of exercise.

After Hindley was transferred  to Durham Prison, a tutor remained sceptical about her motives for self education, saying: ‘Her outside contacts and studies are convincing her she is more able than I think she is. I admire the way she refuses to allow herself to become a cabbage. But I do not trust her.

‘She often appears to me to be a scheming woman, building up  contacts with anyone she thinks has influence.’

By 1981, a report concluded: ‘She has changed from the brassy blonde of more than 16 years  ago to the current picture of an intelligent, well-educated woman who possesses some taste and whose views seem culturally more attuned to middle-class values.’

Yet she never lost the ability to manipulate others.

Jailed: Hindley was put in charge of the kitchen on E wing at Holloway Prison in North London and died in 2002 at Highpoint Prison, Suffolk

‘She was cold and calculating and devoid of emotion, able to smile or cry as the need arose.’

By the time she confessed to the two further child murders Hindley was writing a book and keeping  up with ‘national and inter-national affairs by reading the Guardian and listening to the radio’, said a report.

It added: ‘She has developed a particularly good relationship  with her personal officer and in fact rehearsed her confession to her before her formal interview with police.’

Hindley was transferred to Highpoint Prison, Suffolk, in 1998 and spent her final years in ‘unofficial segregation’ with a television, video recorder and word processor in her single room.

She pursued a long campaign for parole which was always denied her by the courts and the Home Secretary.
