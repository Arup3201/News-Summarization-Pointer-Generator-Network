A young mother told how her boyfriend kidnapped her, drove her to an abandoned quarry, made her strip naked and tied her to a tree – because she said she wanted to go home to bed.

Sophie Lazell, now 26, was nearly asleep when Daniel Jones barged in to the home she shared with her mother and children and grabbed her by the hair.

In front of her family, he dragged her from her bed and drove her for miles to an abandoned quarry in Hampshire.

Jones, right, grabbed Miss Lazell, left, and took her to an abandoned quarry, forced her to strip and tied her to a tree before abandoning her. He was later sentenced to 20 months in prison for the terrifying kidnap

There he told her 'there's already a hole dug for you' before ordering her to strip and tying her to a tree with her pyjamas.

He then drove off, leaving her freezing cold and petrified.

She escaped by breaking free of her makeshift ties, hiding in a bramble bush and running through fields naked for around an hour until she found a house which was occupied by an elderly couple who called 999.

Remarkably she suffered only cuts and bruises in the attack, although she has been left anxious and 'on red alert'.

Speaking publically for the first time since the incident in December 2013, Miss Lazell, now living at an undisclosed location in UK, said she had spent the day with Jones, but he had become upset when she said she wanted to spend the night alone.

He kept calling her so she turned her phone to silent mode and settled into bed for the night.

Miss Lazell said: 'I was just nodding off when I heard a crashing noise.

'It sounded like the front door being kicked in. Then I heard Daniel, shouting.

'He said, "Where is she, the liar?"

'I got up and found Daniel wielding a metal bar. He had smashed the TV. He said, "come with me". Then my mum appeared, and my kids came out of their room.'

Miss Lazell said she was disappointed by the sentence Jones received, believing that he would have been jailed for longer than 20 months 

At this point Jones pulled Miss Lazell towards the front door. In a desperate bid to appease him she offered to run away with him.

'I had to calm him down,' she explained. 'I hoped all the commotion would wake a neighbour who'd call the police. But I didn't hear any sirens.

'As I was leaving I told my kids it would be all right. But I was terrified.'

Jones drove Miss Lazell for 'what seemed like hours' to 'a wooded track that led to a deserted quarry.'

'He demanded I take my trousers off,' Miss Lazell – who was wearing pyjamas – said.

'He then led me to a tree, wrapped my arms around it, and tied them up with my pyjama bottoms.

'He said, "that's what happens to whores," and then forced me to strip completely.'

After a time he drove off and she made her escape, hiding in a ditch when she heard his car.

'I was terrified,' she said. 'I could only see horses' fields.

'There were no lights on or houses.

'I ran for my life.

'I must have been running for an hour, when I spotted a house.'

The police were called and she was taken to hospital. Jones went on the run and was arrested four weeks later. But the attack had a longer lasting impact on Miss Lazell.

'Before, I'd had lots of friends and enjoyed going out on the town,' she said.

'After I didn't know who to trust and was scared to even pop out for a bottle of milk.

'I only left the house at certain times of the day when I thought town would be quiet and I was on the red alert when I did.

'I suffered anxiety attacks and had nightmares.'

In July last year Jones, of Tongham, Hampshire, appeared at Salisbury Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to kidnap.

Ms Lazell said that she was taken to hospital for treatment but it took police four weeks to track Jones down

Neighbours of Miss Lazell said they had heard Jones say: 'You can run Sophie, but you won't get far.'

Her eldest son was heard to say: 'He's going to kill my mum.'

In August, he was sentenced to 20 months in prison for kidnap, and received a five-year restraining order.

Miss Lazell said: 'I'd hoped he'd get longer.'

She urged other women to be alert to potential warnings of domestic abuse.

'My parents had been shocked that Daniel was capable of hurting me,' she said.

I guess on the surface our relationship looked like it was going well. But before the attack he always wanted to know what I'd been up to, was accusing me of cheating. Now I want to encourage other women to leave bad relationships.

'Walk out on physically violent, emotionally and mentally abusive partners. I learnt the hard way that you shouldn't brush things under the carpet. Please, get out, before things turn ugly.'
