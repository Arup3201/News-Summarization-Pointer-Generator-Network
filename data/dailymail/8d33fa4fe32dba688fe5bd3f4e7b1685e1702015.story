Mauricio Pochettino has the Spurs seniors heading to Wembley - and now the youth team fancy a bit of cup glory as well.

A double from Anthony Georgiou and another from Ismail Azzaoui powered Tottenham to a deserved win over Manchester United and set up a sixth round trip to Nottingham Forest in the FA Youth Cup.

With a Capital One Cup final with Chelsea to look forward to, plus the warm memories of Saturday’s Harry Kane heroics against Arsenal, these are good times to be a Spurs fan and the feel-good factor has spread to the club’s academy too.

They were simply too strong for their visitors and undeterred when Marcus Rashford’s brilliant free-kick drew United level midway through the first-half. Taking complete command after the break, they found the necessary goals to prove their superiority and reached the last eight with plenty in reserve.

This was arguably the stand-out tie of the fifth round, with both Spurs and United having designs on winning the competition for the fourth and 11th times respectively, and it was rightly given the grand old stage of White Hart Lane.

Spurs had defeated Blackburn Rovers and Wolves to reach this stage, while United had seen off Bury and Hull City. A win here and both could realistically start thinking about lifting the trophy.

Despite this, the game started at a slow pace and it was the quarter-hour before either side had a sniff of goal.

The lively Azzaoui, who scored a hat-trick for Spurs in the third round and another goal in the fourth, floated in a cross from the right and Christian Maghoma beat keeper Dean Henderson in the air, only to see his header drop wide of the post.

But they had their reward shortly afterwards and Belgium youth international Azzaoui was involved again. This time he swung in a testing low corner that Anton Walkes flicked on at the near post and Georgiou tapped in from a couple of yards out.

Georgiou, a Cypriot youth player, is a regular scorer for the under 18 side but it’s doubtful he’ll have too many simpler chances than this as United’s defence dozed.

Their funk was short-lived, however, and the visitors drew level five minutes later in spectacular fashion. Tyler Reid was clipped about 30 yards from goal and Rashford, sizing up the situation, had no other thought but to shoot.

He produced a vicious shot of pace and dip that was perfectly placed to beat the outstretched glove of Harry Voss and land in the bottom corner.

The Manchester-born frontman, 17, made a name for himself in this competition last season and is clearly up for the Cup again.

Slowly, United clicked into the passing rhythm that is the hallmark of all their sides at all age groups and Callum Gribbin, who scored twice against Hull, came close with a curling effort after Zach Dearnley had beaten two defenders on the right.

At the other end, Henderson dived low to his left to keep out Shayon Harrison’s effort following a purposeful run through the middle.

United had the ball in the net on their first attack of the second-half; Cameron Borthwick-Jackson playing a one-two with Timothy Fosu-Mensah inside the box before finishing, but celebrations were cut short by the linesman’s flag.

These fine margins counted against United and within seconds they were behind again. Joshua Onomah had the presence of mind to spot the unmarked Azzaoui wide on the left and he had ample time to compose himself before lifting the ball over Henderson.

Suddenly, the game was stretched and United captain Axel Tuanzebe stuck out a leg to stop Harrison’s goalbound shot on the turn, before Reid rampaged down the wing to draw a sharp save from Voss.

With 20 minutes left, Spurs took full control when Kyle Walker-Peters sprung Georgiou clear down the right. His pace was too hot for Borthwick-Jackson and the Spurs man closed in before poking the ball between the legs of Henderson for his second of the evening.

It proved the game-killer. Spurs are on the march in a Cup competition once again.
