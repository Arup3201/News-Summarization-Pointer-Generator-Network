Jon Stewart has been attacking the Republicans all week over the government shutdown but he took aim at a member of his own party on Monday night.

Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, was probably expecting a soft-ball interview about the roll out of President Obama's signature health care plan but instead she was left backpedalling to try to recover from his pointed criticisms.

The Comedy Central host started by poking fun at how long the online marketplace takes to load, saying that it was comparable to the amount of time it would take to download all of the movies ever created.

Making sense of it all: Jon Stewart could hardly contain his laugh as Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius tried to explain why it was acceptable for businesses to get a delay and not individuals

After going for the easy laugh, things turned much more serious when he brought up a 'legitimate criticism' that Republicans have made.

Businesses with more than 50 full time employees have been given a delay so that they don't have to provide health insurance for their employees for another year, whereas individuals have to sign up by December 15 or face a fine.

He asked the question repeatedly and Sebelius gave no clear answer, touting the benefits instead and saying that this program will give people more freedom to choose between affordable plans than ever before.

'Let me ask you this- am I a stupid man?' Stewart said at one point.

She attempted to explain that 15 per cent of the country that is made up of individuals who are not already covered due to their existing company plans- as 85 per cent of the country that is already insured.

Both those 15 per cent and the already-covered 85 per cent have no control over when they get sick, and everyone has to be able to walk into an emergency room and be treated.

That explanation fell short, however, but at one point Stewart got her to confirm the following synopsis regarding the fee that individuals face come December: 'What you're saying to the American public is that some of you will face a penalty for the greater good,' he said and Sebelius agreed.

Talking points: Sebelius touted the same line throughout, saying that the health care law gives people more choices than they've ever had but doesn't account for the fine they will pay if they are slow in signing up

Unimpressed: Stewart made it clear that he found Sebelius' explanations insufficient

'Let me tell you why it may seem that I'm a little hard on this: for those of us who are somewhat believing that the opposition right now in Washington are crazy people... it feels like it's frustrating to have to defend something that is less than ideal, or is functioning at what seems to be a level of incompetence that is larger that’s larger than what it should be,' he said later.

She tried her own version of sarcastic, deadpan comedy but it didn't go very far on stage.

'As you know, we’re facing the end of the Western Civilization by having a market-based strategy,' Sebelius said.

'We’re bringing Western Civilization its knees by having a private insurance plan on a website where people pick and choose.'

Many have been anxious about the enrollment numbers so far, and Sebelius was careful not to reveal too much, saying only that 'hundreds of thousands' of accounts have been created but that does not necessarily transition into the number of people who have actually bought a health insurance plan.

None of this met Stewart's standards, however, as used his final sign off to call the Secretary a liar.

'I still don’t understand why individuals have to sign up and businesses don’t, because if the businesses — if she’s saying, "well, they get a delay because that doesn’t matter anyway because they already give health care," then you think to yourself, "f*** it, then why do they have to sign up at all,"' he said.

'And then I think to myself, "well, maybe she’s just lying to me?"'
