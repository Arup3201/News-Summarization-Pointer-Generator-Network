A major search and rescue operation was launched today after dozens of people taking part in a charity swimming race had to be pulled from the sea.

More than 130 swimmers got into difficulty off the coast of Southwold, in Suffolk, with initial reports that up to 90 people were missing, a Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) spokeswoman said.

It was later revealed two swimmers were unaccounted for despite rescue efforts but they were both later found unharmed.

More than 200 people were taking part
in the event, which involved swimming around 
the town's pier before heading to a pub.

Four lifeboats and a rescue helicopter were involved in the search, while two people were taken to Paget University Hospital in Great Yarmouth with suspected hypothermia.

Known as the Southwold Pier to Pub Swim,
organised by local brewery Adnams, those taking part were due to swim a
mile and then finish at The Lord Nelson Pub.

People watching from the shore said that tired swimmers had to be pulled from the water and were wrapped in towels.

The town's lifeboat hut was turned into a makeshift emergency centre.

An MCA spokeswoman said it was unclear how the swimmers got into trouble as weather conditions were fine but the water was 'very cold'.

Some swimmers were rescued by lifeboat while a number of people swam to the shore themselves, she said.

Mayor of Southwold Simon Tobin said: 
'There was a swim with up to 200 people taking part. They got into 
difficulty about 10 minutes after going into the water by the pier. The 
search is continuing.'

A MCA spokesman said: 'Everyone pulled from the water so far has been conscious and there have 
been no reported fatalities. We're still trying to account for one 
person who started the race'.
