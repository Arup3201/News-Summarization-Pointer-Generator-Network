Was that the fried onions mingling with the fumes from the water treatment plant, nearby? Was it the scent of fear from the Liverpool bench? Or was that the magic of the FA Cup drifting through the Kingston air?

There were moments, at least, when Brendan Rodgers must have been worried. AFC Wimbledon had recovered from an early set-back, were making chances and threatening Simon Mignolet's goal. The stars from the Barclays Premier League were far from their comfort zone.

'You come to a stadium like this in that type of game and it's very difficult,' said Rodgers. 'I thought we started the game well and then we lost our shape and presented them with chances by giving the ball away cheaply in the final 15 minutes of the first half.

'We had to defend right through to the end. These are tricky cup ties. It was a very tough game, but we showed the character to pull through. My players deserve some credit for that.'

There is always something special about the sight of elite footballers stepping from their pampered bubble, off the team bus and straight into the land of reality in the third round of the FA Cup, amid a phalanx of portable toilets and scaffolding.

Local roofer Paul Strank, who sponsors one of the stands at Kingsmeadow, must have cancelled his Christmas holidays to rig up the temporary television studios, commentary booths and elevated camera stands required to beam this cup tie around the world.

Kingsmeadow is a tidy ground – befitting of a club so closely associated with the Wombles of Wimbledon Common – but there were new bits were sticking up at all angles.

Gerrard, though, scored a wonderful free-kick to put Liverpool 2-1 up, taking them through to the next round

When the Liverpool captain leaves for America, he will not experience anything like he did on Monday night

What did Mario Balotelli make of it all, as he huddled with the substitutes on the bench? Did he pick up a wi-fi signal for his iPad? Did he enjoy his brief encounter, even if he found scoring no easier against a League Two team?

Will Steven Gerrard miss occasions like this when he packs up his boot bag and heads across the Atlantic Ocean? Will he miss the cramped dressing rooms and claustrophobic corridors at close quarters with someone wearing an old Womble costume?

In the United States, Gerrard will encounter professional athletes built just like Adebayo Akinfenwa... but they will be playing in the NFL.

It is hard to imagine he will ever encounter another footballer of quite the same size and power when he departs England in the summer. Akinfenwa tormented Liverpool at times, scored the goal which wiped out Gerrard's opener and typified Wimbledon's spirit.

Brendan Rodgers, who himself started his coaching career down the leagues, speaks to Neal Ardley

He was booked for his muscular brand of domination and appeared utterly exhausted by the end, but he and strike partner Matt Tubbs, a former lifeguard, provided a gentle nod towards the club's Crazy Gang traditions.

'When we go forward, we're decent,' said Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley. 'It's not easy to mark Akinfenwa and Tubbsy is sharp around the box. It's stuff they're not really used to in the Premier League. We tried to give them a different challenge.'

A blue-and-yellow flag bearing Akinfenwa's nickname 'The Beast' scrawled in blood-red, hung behind Mignolet's goal in the first-half, haunting the goalkeeper as he collided with the striker before the AFC Wimbledon man scored the goal which sparked such great excitement.

At one point in the second half, they took to taunting Mignolet by simply singing: 'Simon, Simon, Simon…' 

Gerrard played for Liverpool for the first time since announcing he will leave at the end of the 2014/15 season

Strange, indeed. They accused the Liverpool fans, squeezed into one corner of the ground of not making enough noise, and being from the north. 'Premier League, you're having a laugh,' they sang.

All of which made for terrific fun, as the Merseysiders huffed and puffed on the field, but they came through the test, largely thanks to a vintage 'superman' display from their skipper, which sent the locals home wondering what might have been.

'There's an element of disappointment for me,' said Ardley. 'A little more quality and nous and we might have got something from that. One rash moment and it proved to be decisive.'

He was talking about the free-kick conceded, from which Gerrard curled in the winning goal and ruined the Wimbledon dream. Maybe, this year, the magic of the FA Cup will be reserved for a fairytale for the departing Liverpool hero.
