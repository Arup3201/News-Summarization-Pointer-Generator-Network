Prince William has hailed the new First World War Galleries at the Imperial War Museum as  a ‘spectacular’ tribute to the courage and dedication of the men and women who sacrificed their lives for freedom.

Touring the London landmark, originally opened by his own great-great grandfather, King George V, in 1920, the prince said the exhibition vividly brought home the brutal realities of the war and demonstrated why the conflict is still relevant today.

A £40million renovation supported by Daily Mail readers has seen the Southwark musuem transformed into a living, interactive tribute to all those affected by conflict.

At its heart are the First World War Galleries which feature original objects, such as letters and diaries from the frontline, in interactive multi-media displays, bringing to life the stories of those who lived through and died in the Great War, which started 100 years ago next month.

William, who in 2010 became patron of the IWM Foundation’s First World War Centenary Campaign, was given a tour by Viscount Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust and chairman of the IWM Foundation, and his wife, Lady Rothermere.

Lord Rothermere’s great-grandfather, the 1st Viscount Rothermere, donated the museum’s present site to the nation after losing two of his three sons in the First World War.

William, who last year left the military himself after serving in the both the Army and the RAF, was visibly moved by the displays.

The future king then joined fellow VIP guests, including Prime Minister David Cameron, to speak in the central hall.

William said: ‘The First World War was famously to be the war that ended all wars.

'As we know only too well, it wasn’t. A war that took hundreds of thousands of young lives has been followed by many other conflicts, woven through history to the present day.

‘In 1920, King George believed this museum would be an inspiration for future generations. I am very pleased to say, it is.’

After the visit Lord Rothermere said he was ‘incredibly proud’ of all those who had been involved in the project. ‘The IWM, and particularly the First World War Galleries, is a record of the toil and sacrifice of a generation and will, we hope, appeal to as many young people as possible,’ he said.
