West Ham are in talks over a deal for Rennes defender Jean-Armel Kana-Biyik. 

The 25-year-old has just one year left on contract with the  Ligue 1 side but looks prepared to leave the French outfit.

West Ham have sent Modibo Maiga out on loan to FC Metz with an option to buy. 

The 26-year-old forward was surplus to requirements at Upton Park and became the second deal between the clubs this month.

The first was Diafra Sakho, who joined West Ham in a permanent move earlier.
