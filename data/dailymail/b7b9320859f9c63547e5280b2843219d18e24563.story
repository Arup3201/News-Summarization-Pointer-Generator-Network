He left Australia with a giant plush toy wombat in tow but if Prince George had stayed just a few more days he might have tried to swap it for the real deal.

A female wombat joey took her first steps outside at Taronga Zoo in Sydney last week.

It was a spectacle that may have delighted little Prince George even more than when he was handed a toy replica by the Australian Governor-General during the royal tour last month.

The Duchess of Cambridge revealed late in the tour that the Prince was 'obsessed with wombats at the moment' after she was handed a book about marsupials during a visit to Sydney's Royal Easter Show.

The eight-month-old old Joey, named Sydney after her place of birth, has only just ventured outside of her mother's pouch.

'Sydney still sleeps very close to her mum, but she's starting to get more adventurous each day and it looks like she'll be an energetic little one as she grows up,' zoo keeper Brett Finlayson said.

She's only the second Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat joey born at the zoo in three years to mum Korra and dad Noojee, with the endangered species notoriously difficult to breed.

Keepers first noticed movement in Korra's pouch three months after mating.

'We didn't know for sure that we'd been successful until we saw a little foot pop out of the pouch,' Mr Finlayson said.

'Compatibility and timing seem to be crucial ingredients for success, as the female is only receptive to the male for a 12-hour window.

'Korra and our male, Noojee, have proven to be a great pairing as this is their second joey in three years.'

The zoo is currently trying to work out the best way to breed Southern Hairy-nosed Wombats in order to help their critically endangered cousin, the Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat.

There is only 200 of the Northern species left in the wild and there is no zoo-based breeding program.

The Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat gets its name from the hairs that cover its rhinarium â€“ the area around the nostrils of the nose.

The species can be found in arid grasslands in the southern coastal region of South Australia and the south eastern corner of Western Australia.

It is one of three kinds of wombats found in Australia, including the Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat and the common Bare-nosed Wombat.
