Fighting for his life: Martin Catterall suffered severe head injuries after being knocked unconscious by a gang in Chorley town centre

A new father is on a life support machine after he was savagely beaten up while 'wetting the baby's head' on a night out with friends.

Martin Catterall, 30, had been celebrating the birth of his child on Saturday night when he was set upon by a gang in Chorley town centre, Lancashire. 

The midnight attack left him with severe head injuries and he is currently in a critical condition at the Royal Preston Hospital.

Police say his injuries are life-threatening and that he is currently on life support.

Four men - two aged 19, a third aged 20 and the fourth aged 24, all from nearby Leyland, also Lancashire, were arrested on suspicion of assault and remain in custody. 

Lancashire Police confirmed the altercation involved 'a number of men' and are appealing for witnesses who may have been in the beer garden of the White Hart pub in Chorley at the time of the assault.

Detective Superintendent Eddie Thistlethwaite said: 'The victim of this assault was knocked unconscious and has been operated on at the Royal Preston Hospital, but he remains critically ill, with life threatening head injuries. 

'He has just become a father for the first time to a young baby which makes this incident all the more tragic.

'We do need people to come forward and tell us what they may know or have seen. 

'One witness that we asked to come forward has done so and we are grateful to him for doing so. 

'But we still need to hear from whoever was in the beer garden of the White Hart public house in Chorley just after midnight in the early hours of Sunday morning and may have seen this assault.

'We are looking at CCTV in a bid to identify potential witnesses. 

'This CCTV includes a number of vehicles driving past the immediate aftermath of the incident.

'One is a white taxi, possibly a Vauxhall Zafira or similar. We would ask the driver or passengers of that or other vehicles to contact us.'

Specially trained officers are currently working with Mr Catterall's family.

Appeal: Police are asking anyone who was in the beer garden of The White Hart Pub in Chorley, above, and who witnessed the incident to come forward

On life support: The midnight attack has left him on life support at the Royal Preston Hospital (above)
