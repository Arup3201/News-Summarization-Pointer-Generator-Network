Futuristic technology inspired by the Tom Cruise hit film Minority Report is to be used by one police force to predict where future crimes will take place.

West Midlands Police is the first in the UK to use the ‘predictive policing’ method to stop house or flat burglaries before they happen in Birmingham.

Their new software system maps crimes and calculates where the next burglary will probably happen, allowing them to send officers to that area of the city.

Film-inspired: West Midlands Police will use a high-tech computer programme to predict crime - a theory tested in the Tom Cruise movie Minority Report

Theory: Police staff at their Birmingham HQ, pictured, are using the system, which looks at where crimes have happened and predicts what streets officers should patrol

Official statistics reveal if a property is burgled once there is a 
30 per cent chance it will be raided again within the next week.

Neighbouring
properties are also at an increased risk of being struck within seven 
days of a house burglary as criminals view the area as a 'weak spot'.

Using this theory the force says it can stop crime before it happens - just like in the thriller Minority Report which saw a team of futuristic cops chasing and punishing offenders before they committed a crime.

Expert: Officer Alex Murray says this software mixed with every day policing will prevent crimes happening

Prof Shane Johnson, who helped design 
the software, said: 'We run it through our software and this generates 
predictions and a map showing the exact locations where crimes are most 
likely to take place in the next few days.

'They can be used by the police to deploy the resources as efficiently as possible.'

Supt Alex Murray, the officer in 
charge of Operation Swordfish, added: 'I think the majority of our 
successes will be around hunch, intuition and offender management.

'But we still need to get out there and try to deter crime taking place in the first place.

'We think probably this is the best 
way of doing that, but the whole thing with an experiment is you don’t 
know until you analyse it afterwards.'

The trial of the software, called Operation Swordfish, has been designed to identify and interpret crime patterns in order to prevent further similar offences.

Police patrols will be stepped up in areas of Birmingham which are highlighted by the programme in a bid to catch repeat offenders.

Businesses and properties which have been burgled will also be fitted with additional security alarms and cameras.

Officers say nearly 30 per cent of the 8,000 burglaries in Birmingham in 2011 were repeat offences which were committed in close proximity to earlier break-ins.

In order to test ‘predictive policing’, half the city will be policed in the traditional way while the other half will use the computer programme.

Plot: Tom Cruise's pre-crime department in Minority Report uses a system that allows them to see into the future and see crime happen in advance

Idea: Pre-cogs like this one, played by Samantha Morton, see into the future but the system turns out to be flawed

The force is working alongside the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science at UCL in London.

Crime stats will be fed into the computer at Stechford Police station in Birmingham where the teams can add data and decide where resources are concentrated.

West Midlands Police is in the process of cutting 2,000 staff as a result of budget cuts.

The six-month pilot in the West Midlands is most extensive trial of predictive policing to date and is being part-funded by the Home Office.

Previous trials have taken place in the suburbs of Los Angeles in the US, where early results have been described as 'promising'.
