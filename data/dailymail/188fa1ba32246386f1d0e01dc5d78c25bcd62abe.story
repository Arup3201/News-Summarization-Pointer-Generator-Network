It could mean the end of out of focus holiday snaps and bring a whole new dimension to selfies.

The Illum camera allows the user to change the focus of their picture after taking a snap.

It can even be used to create interactive images online where users can choose their own focus.

The $1599 Illum camera allows users to change the focus after the picture has been taken using a radical new technology to capture images.

The camera uses a technique known as Light Field Photography.

This captures the color, intensity and direction of every light ray flowing into the camera.

Rays of light entering the camera refract through a series of curved lenses and are captured on the light-field sensor.

The micro-lens array in front of the sensor surface preserves each ray's direction.

The camera offers a 40-megaray light field sensor, 8x optical zoom range, constant f/2.0 aperture and a high-speed shutter capable of freezing motion under a wide variety of conditions.

After the picture is taken, photographers can adjust aspects of images that were previously fixed, such as focus, tilt, perspective shift and depth of field.

'Built to harness the full power of the light field, the professional-grade LYTRO ILLUM will give photographers a new medium capable of capturing visual experiences in their purest form — not as a static cross-section of reality but an authentic, interactive window into their world,' the firm behind the camera said.

'With Lytro Illum, creative pioneers — ranging from artistic amateurs to experienced professionals — will tap into a new wave of graphical storytelling. Now artist and audience alike can share an equally intimate connection with the imagery, and, in a sense, jointly participate in the magic of its creation,' said Lytro CEO Jason Rosenthal.

'By combining a novel hardware array with tremendous computational horsepower, this camera opens up unprecedented possibilities to push the boundaries of creativity beyond the limits inherent in digital or film photography.'

Lytro hopes the camera will lead to a new type of picture.

'The camera paves the way for an immersive brand of storytelling in which images can be brought to life in multiple dimensions through Light Field Photography,' it said.

'In capturing the color, intensity and direction of every light ray flowing into the camera, LYTRO ILLUM provides a massive amount of visual information that allows photographers to recreate sights and scenes on a truly experiential canvas.'

The camera has a traditional shutter, but can capture a huge amount of information allowing the focus to be changed at any time.

The firm has been testing the camera with professional photographers.

'My photography style pushes me to look for ways to tell a more compelling story with every image. Lytro Illum gave me that ability by incorporating an interactive element that captures different visual touch points at every depth,' said Kyle Thompson, a Chicago-based photographer known for his surreal conceptual style and

'Light Field Photography is following the classic pattern for a transformational concept,' said Lytro founder Dr. Ren Ng.
