These chimps were more than happy to pose for their close-ups with a camera so small they didn't even notice it was there.

These unique pictures were taken with the world's 'first digital fisheye camera' after its developer managed to get the device through the meshing of a monkey pen.

The snaps show the monkeys playing at the Wales Ape and Monkey Sanctuary - giving the viewer a rare glimpse of life from inside their pens.

The digital fisheye camera has been designed by Greg Dash and has a wide 170 degree view and can shoot anything from 2megapixel to 12megapixel images as well as film video footage.

There is no viewfinder or screen to view the images so users will have to wait until they have hooked the device up to their computers, which is how the camera is charged, before they can see the end result of their pictures.

Its tiny size means it can squeeze in pretty much anywhere and take images from a unique vantage point.

The Aberystwyth University postgraduate, 25, came up with the idea after trying to buy a fisheye camera lens but failing to find one in his budget.

Inventor Greg Dash is now hoping to get funding to make his design available to the general public

After completing the camera, he was inundated with requests from other people who wanted to buy one.

He is now trying to secure funding of £35,000 to make 500 more cameras and get the product on to the market.

Mr Dash told the Metro: ‘I couldn’t afford to spend hundreds of pounds on a lens for my SLR, so I decided to design my own point and shoot fisheye camera.

‘This is a really unique camera, there really isn’t anything else like it currently out there.

‘It would be great for others to be able to take some cool photos at a fraction of the regular cost of a fisheye lens.’
