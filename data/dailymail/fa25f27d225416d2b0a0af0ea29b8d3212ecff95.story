A sun-worshipping mother has been left with a huge chunk missing from her leg after surgery for skin cancer.

Julie Dawson, 40, blames her devotion to a 'good tan' for developing a huge cancerous mole on her right calf.

She says that following surgery to remove the cancer, she looks as if she has been bitten by a shark.

Diagnosis: Julie Dawson (with partner Andy) was diagnosed with melanoma after years of sun worshipping

Medics saved her life by cutting out a massive chunk of her right limb in a bid to completely remove all traces of the malignant melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer.

She has been left with a large hole on her leg, leaving her too shy to wear swimwear, shorts or dresses.

Ms Dawson, an office administrator from Consett, Co Durham, said: 'I used to love shorts and dresses, but now I never wear them.

'My vanity to be tanned almost cost me my life, and it’s certainly knocked my confidence.

'I hate my scar. Whenever anyone notices it, I tell them I’ve been bitten by a shark, but there aren’t many sharks round here.'

She first noticed a suspicious-looking 
mole on her right calf in 2007, which grew to the size of two one-pound 
coins stacked on top of each other.

She had the operation to remove the huge cancerous growth the following year, which left her with a large palm-sized gash on her leg.

She added: 'When I was a kid, we’d always be out playing with no suncream on.

'And then when I got older, we’d be out sitting in the pubs. I always had my legs out, but never bothered putting suncream on.

'I suppose I’ve only got myself to blame really, especially because I used to go on sunbeds a couple of times a week, but I didn’t know.

'It was only during my treatment that Macmillan helped me realise I had been doing all the wrong things during my cancer treatment.

'They taught me I had been doing all the wrong things for years, and helped me pay for the 30-mile round trip to the hospital I had to take every day to get my dressings changed.

Mrs Dawson said: 'I hate my scar. Whenever anyone notices it, I tell them I've been bitten by a shark'

'Having skin cancer made me frightened and alone, but my friends, family and the Macmillan online community helped me through.

'I want other people to realise that skin cancer is very real, and they need to take precautions otherwise at best they’ll be left scarred for life like me.

'It nearly left my boys without a mum.'

Ms Dawson lives with her partner Anthony Panting, 52, and sons Liam, ten, and six-year-old Daniel.

Carol Goodman, Cancer Information Nurse Specialist at Macmillan Cancer Support says:

'See
 your GP if you have any of the signs of malignant melanoma such as 
moles that change shape, size or colour, have jagged borders, are 
raised, bleed or are bigger than a pea, or if you notice any other 
changes to your skin.'

'It’s important that you take care in the sun. Use a sunscreen of at least SPF30 and reapply it often.

'Wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses and avoid the midday sun.'

She is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support’s campaign to ensure no-one faces cancer alone and to raise awareness of the dangers of skin cancer, after she received financial help from the charity to pay for travel costs during her treatment.

Carol Goodman, Cancer Information Nurse Specialist at Macmillan Cancer Support said: 'The number of people with malignant melanoma is increasing, with around 13,000 people diagnosed in the UK each year.

'Some people still don’t understand that sunbathing and using sun beds damages the skin.

'We want people to enjoy the sunny weather but be mindful of the damage too much sun exposure can cause.

'It’s important that you take care in the sun. Use a sunscreen of at least SPF30 and reapply it often.
