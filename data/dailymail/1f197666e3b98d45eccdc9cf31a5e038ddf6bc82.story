An under-pressure crime tsar has reacted to criticism from David Cameron after he said she had failed to impress in her job.

Kent’s elected police and crime commissioner (PCC) Ann Barnes said Mr Cameron was 'entitled to his opinion'.

But she said she believed she was doing a 'really good job' and that she had not considered quitting.

She told BBC South East: 'I have never spoken to David Cameron. David Cameron doesn’t know what I’m like or what I do as PCC.

'He’s entitled to his opinion. He’s obviously reflecting what people around the county have said to him and lots of people have reflected things back to me, and I take on board whatever anyone has said to me.'

Mrs Barnes reacted publicly for the first time since Mr Cameron said in an interview with BBC Radio Kent last month: 'I don’t think she’s making a very good fist of her job.

'But the truth is that people in Kent will have an answer to that, which is to be able to elect a new police and crime commissioner.'

Mrs Barnes, who travels around in a van she dubs 'Ann Force 1', has faced a string of controversies since being elected to her £85,000-a-year post in 2012.

She came under-fire after she appointed Paris Brown, then aged 17, as Britain’s first youth crime commissioner.

Miss Brown later resigned from the £15,000-a-year post after making offensive comments on Twitter.

Earlier this year, Mrs Barnes, a former teacher, apologised after taking part in a controversial Channel 4 fly-on-the-wall documentary.

Kent’s rank-and-file officers rebuked her for making their force a 'laughing stock' in the programme, Meet The Police Commissioner.

In it, she
 struggled to explain what her role involved, failed to write her title 
correctly on a whiteboard and was filmed painting her 'flaky' nails.

She
 also said in the hour-long programme that driving a Mercedes was not 
her 'image' - and she was then filmed in the next shot arriving at work 
in a Mercedes.

Pressure
 on Mrs Barnes later intensified when it emerged her second youth crime 
tsar, Kerry Boyd, faced allegations of a relationship with a married 
former councillor.

Former
 London 2012 torchbearer Miss Boyd, 20, replaced Miss Brown - but 
stepped away from making public engagements when reports of the 
relationship surfaced.
