Man problem: Peyronie's disease leads to abnormal curvature, indentations and shrinkage of the penis

A jab used for ‘claw hand’ may offer hope to male patients suffering a common cause of sexual dysfunction.

Peyronie’s disease (PD) is caused by the growth and hardening of fibrous plaques in the soft tissue of the penis, leading to abnormal curvature, indentations and shrinkage.

The condition affects up to ten per cent of men, mostly white and over 40, though some are as young as 18.

It is considered problematic enough 
for treatment only if the abnormal curvature is more than 30 degrees – 
as more than this might mean intercourse is painful for both partners, 
or impossible.

The drug 
Xiapex, also known by US brand name Xiaflex, is a recognised therapy for
 Dupytren’s Contracture, otherwise known as claw hand, a condition in 
which similar fibrous plaques prevent the straightening of the fingers.

Famous Dupytren’s sufferers include Margaret Thatcher.

The
 active ingredient in Xiapex, collagenese, is a natural enzyme which 
breaks down excess collagen.

It is administered in a series of 
injections into the plaque, while massaging is used to encourage the 
break up of problem tissue.

After
 effects can include bruising and swelling, and to eliminate the risk of
 accidental ruptures that would lead to permanent erectile dysfunction, 
it can be administered only by experienced urologists trained in its 
application.

Xiapex was 
granted approval in the US for treatment of PD last year. Its safety and
 effectiveness were established in two randomised double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies in 832 men.

Participants were given up to 
four treatment cycles of Xiapex or a placebo and were then followed for 
52 weeks. The drug treatment significantly reduced curvature deformity 
and related problems.

The European rights to Xiapex were 
originally licensed to Pfizer, which has since given up options on the 
drug. It has now been picked up by Swedish pharmaceutical group Sobi, 
which is seeking a European licence for use in PD. However, the drug 
company wranglings have been a setback.

The
 only treatment currently sanctioned by the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is shockwave therapy, using targeted 
sonic pulses.

Reports 
indicate a 50 per cent success rate in breaking up the plaque. Although 
NICE is satisfied the procedure is safe, experts remain divided.

Surgery
 is another option but this often leads to shortening of the penis by an
 inch on average and is not commonly offered on the NHS, as the 
condition is benign. The cost privately is about £4,000.

Xiapex is also expensive. It is estimated it would cost £2,000 for enough to treat PD.

Dr Martin Gelbard, clinical trial investigator in the department of urology at the University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, said: ‘In my practice, treating PD has been a challenge as, until now, we have had few options to offer our patients.

'I believe [Xiapex] is a significant achievement and offers a new option for urologists: the first approved treatment to be administered non-surgically that is proven safe and effective for this physically and psychologically devastating disorder.’

Suks Minhas, a consultant at London Urlogy Associates, welcomes the innovation, saying: ‘I’d like to be able to offer my patients an alternative to surgery.’

A range of alternative treatments, including supplements and mechanical gadgets, are offered by small companies on the internet but Suks Minhas, a consultant at London Urology Associates, urges caution.

‘For anyone who suspects they may have Peyronie’s, the first port of call should always be a GP or a qualified urologist,’ he says.
