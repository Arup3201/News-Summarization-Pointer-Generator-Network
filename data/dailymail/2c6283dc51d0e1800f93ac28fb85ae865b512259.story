The war in Afghanistan will end up costing taxpayers £20billion, it emerged last night.

At a Nato summit in Chicago, David Cameron and other world leaders will tomorrow draw up a firm timetable for pulling combat troops off the frontline against the Taliban.

But official figures show that the war had already cost £17.3billion by the end of March this year on top of regular defence spending since 2001.

About tiem: A firm timetable will be drawn up to withdraw troops from Afghanistan - but it has already hit taxpayers hard

The true cost of the war was revealed by the House of Commons Library and will be formally published by the Ministry of Defence later this year.

It puts Britain on course for a bill approaching £20billion by the time British troops hand over responsibility for combat operations in Helmand province.

A total of 414 British servicemen have lost their lives in the country, more than 20 of them at the hands of the Afghan security forces they are supposed to be training to take over.

The Government has said British troops will have ended combat operations by the end of December 2014.

But Mr Cameron has also signalled that a large number of troops will pull back from the frontline and begin coming home next year.

British troop numbers will fall from 9,500 to 9,000 this year and that number is expected to halve during 2013. Mr Cameron will use the Nato summit to demand that other countries help shoulder some of the costs of the conflict as Western military involvement winds down.

In an article published yesterday, Mr Cameron said countries that had not sent troops should shoulder their share of costs since the world’s leading economies had paid a disproportionate amount.

‘Today the G8 accounts for four-fifths of the donor funding now going to the region,’ he said. ‘We must encourage other countries to step up and contribute to the future of Afghanistan, irrespective of the role they have played so far.’

But the most pressing issue to be discussed at the Chicago summit will be to ensure that Western governments launch a co-ordinated withdrawal.

The Prime Minister and President Barack Obama will ask the new French President, Francois Hollande, to ditch his election pledge to withdraw France’s 3,300 troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year. Mr Hollande has already watered down his pledge.

He now talks about withdrawing combat troops, rather than all troops, by the end of the year.

But French officials have made it clear that he is likely to want all troops home during the early part of 2013.

British commanders are concerned that an early French withdrawal will put pressure on Britain and the US to fill the gaps left behind.

The National Security Council in London has also discussed warnings that failure to leave in an orderly and co-ordinated manner would leave British troops at greater risk of attack as they pull out.

The UK has been in talks with neighbouring Uzbekistan about pulling soldiers out across that land border. Removing lots of heavy equipment will add to the costs of the war.

Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said the huge costs of the Afghan operation made an orderly withdrawal all the more important.

‘After the lives sacrificed and the money spent, it is vital that withdrawal does not lead to the return of the conditions which led us to war,’ he added.

‘Withdrawal must be internationally co-ordinated and we need a renewed focus on the safety of British personnel before and beyond 2014.’
