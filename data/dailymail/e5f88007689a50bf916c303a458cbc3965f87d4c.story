A 16-year-old girl who was found dead in the woods behind her Gainesville, Georgia home on Friday night posted several ominous messages online before she vanished.

Hannah Truelove, who was reported missing by her mother on Thursday night, had mentioned a stalker on her Twitter account and had said in another post that she was 'scared'.

Detectives ruled on Monday that they were investigating the girl's death as a homicide and said she suffered a violent death at the hands of someone she knew.

Tragic: 16-year-old schoolgirl, Hannah Truelove, was found dead in the woods behind her Gainesville home on Friday night; her mother had reported her missing the night before

Ominous: Detectives are looking into whether the teenager was killed by a stalker; they are asking the girl's friends and family about her tweets including this August 12 post

Sgt. Kiley Sargent with the Hall 
County Sheriff's Department told The Times of Gainesville that Truelove 
received injuries that 'were indicative that she died from a violent 
death.'

Sargent told the newspaper that 
authorities don't believe it was a random assault and have information 
that Truelove may have known her attacker.

Detectives are going through dozens 
of tips they have received about the schoolgirl to try to determine 
exactly what happened to her. They are encouraging anyone who might have
information about Truelove to come forward.

The teenager’s body was discovered in the woods behind the Lake Lanier Club Apartments, where she lived with her mother.

Authorities have classified the schoolgirl’s death as ‘suspicious’ and detectives are questioning her family and friends about her eerie tweets.

On August 12, she posted: ‘I got me an uglyass stalker’ and followed it up with a tweet which read, ‘This can’t be happening…’

The following week, on August 18, she wrote: ‘So scared right now.’

Investigating: Detectives are trying to make sense of Truelove's posts on Twitter

Fours days later, on the 22nd, the day before she was reported missing, she tweeted: ‘I need to move out of these dang apartments.'

However, many of Truelove's tweets are of song lyrics and sound typical of a teenager going through a break-up.

On Friday night, a grandfather visiting his grandchildren found Truelove’s body as he walked through the woods.

An autopsy was performed on Monday, which may lead authorities to rule Truelove's death as a homicide.

'Suspicious' death: Authorities have not released the findings of Monday's autopsy as the investigation into Truelove's death continues

The findings of the autopsy are not being disclosed as the investigation continues.

Sgt.Stephen Wilbanks of the Hall County Sheriff's Office told WXIA-TV that it did not appear that Truelove was the victim of a stranger.

As investigators continued to follow every tip today, grief counsellors attended Gainesville High School, where Truelove was a student.

'She had a huge heart. She always put people before herself,' friend Joshua Morrow told Fox News.
