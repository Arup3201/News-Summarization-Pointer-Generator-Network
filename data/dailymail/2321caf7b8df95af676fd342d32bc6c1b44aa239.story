Holly Willoughby has revealed she is expecting her third child with husband Dan Baldwin.

The 33-year-old presenter made the announcement on her official website and tweeted a link with the caption, 'I've got something to tell you!'

Her blog then revealed the statement: 'Surprise Surprise (and it was a surprise!!) I'm really happy and excited to tell you that Dan and I are expecting baby number 3!!

'We feel blessed and very luck to be giving Belle and Harry a little brother or sister later this year. '

Happy news: Holly Willoughby has revealed she is expecting her third baby with husband Dan Baldwin

Announcement: Holly accompanied her blog post with a cute picture of herself and Dan

The couple are already parents to Harry, four, and Belle, aged two.

The happy news comes after Holly kept 
her figure concealed beneath a billowing pink scarf as she was seen 
leaving the Riverside Studios after filming Celebrity Juice on Wednesday.

Keeping the 
scarf pressed closely to her body, Holly was keen not to let anything 
slip before she was ready to make the official announcement in her own 
time.

Blooming: Could Holly's scarf be an indication of the sex of her baby?

In an interview last year, Holly admitted that she is ‘perennially broody’ for another child, insisting it was just 'a question of when and if'.

She said: 'I would like another baby, so let’s 
wait and see. I’ve always thought I’d have a big family so if I’m lucky 
enough to fall pregnant again, great.

‘It’s just a question of when and if it happens. You can’t set aside time specially.'

Holly, who may well have been pregnant at the time of the interview, added: 'It is a weird thing planning a baby. You can make sure it doesn’t happen but making sure it does is a different thing.'

Stylish: Holly became known for her style during her pregnancy and even launched a maternity range with Littlewoods back in 2009

It remains to be seen how Holly's pregnancy will affect her work on both This Morning and Celebrity Juice.

Last time she was pregnant, Holly caused a Twitter storm by telling her then 675,000 followers that she had gone into labour.

The blonde beauty has already been flooded with congratulatory messages from both fans and celebrity pals on Twitter.

Leading the way: Caroline Flack was one of the first to tweet her congratulations

This Morning co-presenter Emma Willis tweeted: '@hollywills WOOP WOOP!! Congratulations to you and dan you lovely lady! X (sic)'

The Xtra Factor host Caroline Flack wrote: '@hollywills wahhhhhhh! Amazing news. Congratulations and @DanPBaldwin xx (sic)'
