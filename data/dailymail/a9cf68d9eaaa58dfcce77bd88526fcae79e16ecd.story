Osama bin Laden had no plans for terrorist attacks at the time of his death, according to new evidence.

The last Al Qaeda attack he was involved in planning was the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005 where he was in close contact with other terrorists. 

Although bin Laden remained a figure head for extremists, he had little involvement during his final years holed up in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

Information found at the hide-out, where the Al Qaeda chief was killed on May 2 by U.S. troops, suggested that bin Laden also had advance knowledge of several plots that failed. 

This included a London-based plan in 2006 to blow up transatlantic flights using home-made liquid explosives.

The plot was disrupted when British 
authorities launched a major round-up of suspects.

Flights to and from 
Britain were severely disrupted and tight new restrictions were placed 
on passenger carry-on items such as liquids and gels.

Al Qaeda also attempted to target the New York subway in 2009 and unspecified targets in Europe last year.

One official said: 'Bin Laden was 
absolutely a detail guy. We have every reason to believe that he was 
aware of Al Qaeda's major plots during the planning phase, including the
airline plot in 2006 and the London 7/7 attacks.'

Although
there is no 'smoking gun' evidence to prove he masterminded the London 
bombings, there is strong evidence that he was in close contact with 
other Al Qaeda militants as they planned the attacks.

Another official source said that bin Laden was 'immersed in operational details of the group's activities. We believe he was aware of these plots ahead of time'.

Feared: Osama bin Laden was behind the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. and 7/7 London bombings

A total of 56 people, including four 
suicide bombers, died in the attacks on three London Tube trains and a 
double-decker bus on July 7, 2005. Hundreds more were injured in the 
planned bombings.

'It was the last successful operation Osama bin Laden oversaw,' a source  said.

Although British-led investigations had established Al Qaeda's role in 7/7, bin Laden had not been personally
linked to the bombings until recently.

No evidence was found at the Pakistan
compound to suggest that bin Laden was involved in planning further 
attacks directed at Western targets.

Videos released after bin Laden's death showed him as a vain man, obsessed with his own image and how he was portrayed to the world - even from the confines of the Pakistan compound.

One of the films released by U.S. security forces, shows Bin Laden, his unkempt beard streaked with grey, sitting on the floor, wrapped in a brown blanket and holding a remote control.

He flipped back and forth between what appears to be live news coverage of himself. The old, small television was perched on top of a desk with a large tangle of electrical wires running to a nearby control box.

The CIA discovered that a satellite dish provided a television feed to bin Laden's suburban compound.

The video also revealed that Bin Laden had a computer in his home, though officials say there were no Internet or phone lines running from the house.
