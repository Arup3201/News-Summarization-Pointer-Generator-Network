It can take up to three months longer to sell your home in some parts of Britain than others, with certain areas taking ‘more than a year’ to find a buyer, a report has revealed.

The research, by the property website Rightmove, highlights the enormous regional variations in the country’s housing market which leave many homeowners frozen out of the boom.

The winner – for once – is not London, but Cambridge.

Properties sell quicker in the famous university town than they do anywhere else in the country, typically taking just 27 days to find a buyer - compared to a national average of 65 days.

And the speed at which homes in Cambridge are snapped up has increased significantly over the last year. It typically took 39 days last year, a fall of 30 per cent.

By comparison, the loser is Powys in Wales where it typically takes 113 days to find a buyer, or more than four times longer than it takes in Cambridge.

In fact, Wales and the North West dominate Rightmove’s list of the most difficult places to sell a home.

Of the bottom ten, three are in Wales – Powys, Gwynedd and Conwy – and four are in the North West – Sefton, Fylde, Rochdale and Allerdale, a district of Cumbria around Workington.

Andrew Bradshaw, from the estate agency Bradshaws Residential in Cambridge, said: ‘We have one interested buyer looking to move from Wales to Cambridge.

‘But they’ve had their property on the market in Wales for over a year with no sign of selling it.’

He added: ‘In the current market, we are finding a number of buyers for many properties within two weeks or even a week in some cases.’

Many clients are selling their home elsewhere and have to rent in Cambridge until a property finally becomes available to buy in the sought-after city.

Of the 50 or so homes in Cambridge sold by Savills, the upmarket estate agency, last year, just three were sold for less than the guide price.

The average price that they were sold for was £850,000, according to Ed Meyer, head of residential sales at Savills in Cambridge.

On average, they went for between five and ten per cent above the guide price, but the winner was sold for an extra 23 per cent.

In Wales, the experience is fundamentally different for many homeowners who need to sell.

Melfyn Williams, from Williams & Goodwin The Property People [corr], an estate agency in Gwynedd, said: ‘The ripple effect from London and talk of a widespread ‘over-heated’ market has not reached Gwynedd.

‘The average time is three to four months to secure a sale. There are many properties that have now been for sale for over 12 months.’

Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove and a housing market analyst, said the research shows ‘just how different the pace of the housing market is at a very local level.’

The report comes as the Office for National Statistics said the average price of a home in London has jumped to nearly £500,000.

In just 12 months, a typical home in the capital has jumped by 20.1 per cent, the sharpest rise in a single year since the ONS’s comparable records began in 2002.

Overall, the ONS said the average price of a home in the UK is £262,000, a rise of 10.5 per cent over the last year, the biggest annual rise for four years.

Rightmove’s research was based on what had happened to 150,000 properties advertised for sale between April and June this year on its website, compared to 125,000 during the same period last year.

The property was deemed to have been ‘sold’ if the buyer and seller had agreed a deal, known as being ‘sold subject to contract’. They had not exchanged or completed.
