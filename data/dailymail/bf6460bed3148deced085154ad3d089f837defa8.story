MCC president Mike Gatting has questioned in public whether a joyless England camp has remained too intense through this Ashes debacle.

Gatting, an Ashes-winning captain in Australia, made his comments while on a corporate breakfast function panel at the Sydney Cricket Ground before the start of the fifth Test.

Gatting claimed Aussie coach Darren Lehmann has the work-play balance right, with a joke of the day and a beer on the bus rather than  England’s endless video analysis of their errors.

And Gatting added that he felt senior
players, as well as not scoring enough runs, had not given enough 
direction to the rest of the squad.

England’s
beleaguered team director Andy Flower defended his approach after a 
fourth defeat in a row at Melbourne saying, if anything, a new intensity
was necessary for Sydney.

Kevin Pietersen, still England’s marquee batsman, has Australian bat company Spartan Sports chasing his signature. They are aware that KP’s adidas contract expires in 2014 and will be first in the queue if it is not renewed.

KP has been a major adidas client since they moved into cricket in 2008. But adidas will need to be convinced he intends playing on for a number of years before committing to another big contract. Spartan, who pay around £250,000 a year for Michael Clarke’s endorsement, are likely to meet KP’s asking price if adidas don’t.

Meanwhile, Steve Smith, a century-maker for Australia on Friday, is said to be switching from Slazenger to a Spartan bat.

The emergence of Ben Stokes is the only  positive that England can take out of this  dismal tour and the all-rounder looks to have some much-needed character as well. Asked after his six-wicket haul whether he was up for the ‘fray’, Stokes replied: ‘What does that mean? Don’t use those big words on me.’

The Australian media have ended the Ashes  as they began in Brisbane with another puerile newspaper offensive. The Sydney Daily Telegraph has a giant billboard truck displaying  the ‘sneering snouts’ of the England team, which they intend to whitewash to cover ‘their unsightly faces full of colonial smirk’.

Swann gets on his bike

Graeme Swann, who has been keen on motor sport since growing up near Silverstone, may make his media debut commentating on motorbikes if he does join BT Sport. Their rights include the next five years of Moto GP. On the cricket front, BT will be bidding for the Indian Premier League along with the ICC’s T20 and 50-over World Cups and Champions Trophy.

Swann is due to receive just 30 days’ notice money from his central contract after quitting  with two Tests to go Down Under. Paul Collingwood, who was eased out of the team following the Sydney Test victory three years ago, was paid the full nine months left on his ECB contract.

There is mystery as to why former Australian captain Bobby Simpson’s induction into the ICC Hall of Fame this week was such a low-key affair. The ceremony, despite Simpson starting in cricket right by the Sydney Cricket Ground, was a little-publicised reception there on the eve of the Test — previous inductees Adam Gilchrist and Shane Warne were feted on the pitch during a Test.

Certainly, Simpson is not the most popular of former Australian greats. Cricket Australia said arrangements were made by the ICC, whose spokesman added that one of their Hall of Fame events every year is always a function.

The MCC hierarchy, out in force in Australia, should take time to examine the facilities at Sydney, which make Lord’s look second-rate in comparison. The media’s working conditions at cricket’s headquarters lag behind almost all  international grounds in Australia and those in South Africa, India and even Bangladesh.

A lot about Shane Warne has changed since the last Ashes tour Down Under, including his brilliant white teeth and his preferred insult for Sports Agenda. It used to be ‘you’re a muppet’ but has now been upgraded to ‘you’re a k***-jockey’.
