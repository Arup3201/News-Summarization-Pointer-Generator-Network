Mohamed bin Hammam, chief of the Asian Football Confederation, denied fresh allegations of bribery after questions were raised over the integrity of choosing the emirate as tournament host

David Cameron hinted yesterday that England may again seek to host the World Cup, amid calls for Qatar to lose the tournament over corruption claims.

Football’s world governing body, Fifa, is facing growing demands to re-run the bidding for the 2022 competition after allegations a top official spent millions ‘buying’ support for Qatar’s campaign.

The 2018 tournament, which went to Russia, and 2022 were awarded at the same time, prompting commentators to suggest the voting process was tainted and should be repeated from scratch.

Mr Cameron said Fifa investigator Michael Garcia should be allowed to complete his probe into whether corrupt payments influenced the selection.

But appearing to open the door for England’s 2018 bid to be resurrected, he added: ‘Who knows what the chances may be for the future?’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg backed calls for Qatar to be stripped of the competition if allegations are upheld that Qatari former Fifa official Mohamed bin Hammam bribed African and Asian football bosses.

He tweeted: ‘These are shocking allegations. If proven true, Fifa must rerun the contest fairly and openly.’

Mr Bin Hammam, 65, is accused of flouting Fifa’s bribery rules by using up to £3million to make payments to football officials from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.

Qatar’s bid committee said Mr Bin Hammam played ‘no official or unofficial role’ in efforts to secure the competition and denied all wrongdoing.

* David Cameron has joked he needs a bigger TV so he can watch the World Cup in style.

During a visit to a distribution warehouse for Curry’s, Dixons and PC World he was asked whether he would be watching the World Cup on a large TV.

‘My television at home is actually very old,’ the Prime Minister replied.

‘I think it’s 28in, and I was looking at it…and thinking it is time for a new television.’
