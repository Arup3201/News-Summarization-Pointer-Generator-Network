Life after Steven Gerrard may not be so bleak for Liverpool after all.

Liverpool have won all six Premier League matches their legendary skipper has missed this season.

While no-one is doubting Gerrard's influence and legacy at Anfield it appears Brendan Rodgers has his side well-drilled for his captain's departure in the summer.

Gerrard, 34, recently announced that he will leave Liverpool for LA Galaxy at the end of the season.

When he departs for the US he will bring to an end a 17-year Anfield career which has seen him win 10 trophies in red, including the Champions League in 2005 and the FA Cup in 2001 and 2006.

And Liverpool fans will be optimistic there is plenty more silerware to come once Gerrard has gone if the young pretenders to his Anfield throne keep up their fine form.

The Reds have turned their season around in 2015 after a poor start to the campaign and are now right in contention for a Champions League place.

Fellow English midfielders Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana are among those to have stepped up to the plate since Gerrard's enforced absence through injury.

Gerrard, who returned to training this week following a hamstring injury, will hope to bid a glorious goodbye to Liverpool in the FA Cup final on May 30 - which also happens to be his birthday.

They take on Blackburn in the Sixth Round at Anfield on Sunday.
