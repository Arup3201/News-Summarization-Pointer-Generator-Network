Trouble: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is facing accusations that he leaked details of the 'Plebgate' affair to the press

Britain's top police officer was facing further questions last night over allegations that he leaked details of the police inquiry into the ‘Plebgate’ affair.

In a letter to a senior Home Office official, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has admitted briefing journalists about the row involving Tory MP Andrew Mitchell days before media reports claimed there was no evidence that officers lied about being insulted by the former Cabinet  Minister.

The letter emerged after friends of the MP used a Freedom of Information request to Scotland Yard to obtain details of the meetings with journalists.

In it, Sir Bernard also admits he failed to keep any record of what was said during the meetings.

Last night, friends of Mr Mitchell said the Commissioner still had questions to answer over the handling of the investigation and what was said to journalists.

One MP said: ‘It is of concern that no police note was made of exactly what was said so that we have to rely on Bernard Hogan-Howe’s own personal recollection.’

In the letter to Stephen Rimmer, the Home Office’s most senior policing official, the Commissioner says he was present at two meetings involving five newspapers and the Press Association on March 25 and 26 this year.

He writes that he told journalists he was ‘concerned that if we did not conclusively prove what happened at the gate of Downing Street on  19 September this could result in reputational damage for all concerned’. Mr Mitchell was forced to resign as Chief Whip following an altercation in Downing Street in which he was alleged to have called officers ‘******* plebs’ – something he strongly denies.

The force began an investigation, called Operation Alice, into the Plebgate officers and the leaking of police logs backing up their account of the incident to newspapers.

The saga took a further twist at the end of March – only days after Sir Bernard’s two meetings with journalists – when it was claimed police had briefed newspapers on the investigation before a report on the inquiry was handed to prosecutors, and that it exonerated the officers. But in the letter, the Commissioner says that he had not seen the police file.

He tells Mr Rimmer: ‘As Commissioner, it is not normal practice for me to see our investigative files and I can say categorically that I have not seen the file relating to Operation Alice.

‘Therefore, I was not in a position to brief on the contents.

‘I am briefed on the broad progress of an investigation, particularly the timetable and any significant resource implications.’

He adds that in the course of answering journalists’ questions: ‘I did say that I was concerned that if we did not conclusively prove what happened at the gate of Downing Street on 19 September this could result in reputational damage for all concerned. We could therefore be left in the position of having one person’s word against another.’

But the Commissioner conceded that neither he nor the press officer accompanying him to the meetings took any notes – something he  said was ‘usual practice’ when meeting with editors for ‘non-reportable briefings’.

A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service said that no decision has been taken on whether any of the officers will face charges over Plebgate.

Hitting back: The revelation came as Mr Mitchell's lawyer confirmed he has launched a libel lawsuit against The Sun which first broke the story to face 'the campaign of vilification by the newspaper against him'
