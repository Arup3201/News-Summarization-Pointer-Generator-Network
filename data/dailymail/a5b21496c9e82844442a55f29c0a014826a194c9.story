People could save £75,000 each if they gave up their bad habits during Lent, researchers claim.

A study found that people could bank and extra £18,425 during their working life if they abstained from cigarettes, alcohol, chocolate and coffee.

Experts say that if they invested this money well, by the time the retired they could have £74,612 in the bank.

However, the benefits are not just financial.

The researchers at AXA say that average alcohol consumption just during Lent adds up to a total of 4,700 calories and that it would take 673 minutes of running to burn this off.

They say that chocolate consumption during the same period adds up to an average of 8,100 calories.

This means that anyone who is feeling very virtuous and who gives up both chocolate and alcohol during Lent could save themselves 12,804 calories a year.

The researchers also say that during Lent people spend an average of £376 pounds on alcohol, cigarettes and chocolate.

Those who give up just smoking could save £220 a year while giving up alcohol would add another £78 of savings.

This figure for smoking is worked out on the basis that the average cigarette now costs 40p and the average smoker smokes about 12 cigarettes a day during the 46 days of Lent.

Those who are partial to the occasional chocolate bar could have an extra £20 in their bank by the end of Lent each year if they give up the sweet stuff.

This figure is worked out on the basis that the average Briton eats about three quarters of a chocolate bar a day.

The researchers point out, also, that giving up chocolate can save people money in other ways.

For example, eating too much chocolate can rot the teeth meaning giving it up could save people money on dental treatment.

If a person also gave up coffee shop coffees, they could save another £57 during Lent.

Andy Zanelli, Head of Retirement Planning, AXA Wealth, said: ‘Small sacrifices, even during the relatively brief 46 day period of Lent, can mean major savings – and these savings can be maximised if invested in appropriate ways, such as through an ISA rather than simply storing savings in a current account, especially at a time of low interest rates.

‘Putting money to one side – even if it means making some sacrifices along the way – is becoming a necessity and, invested prudently, can reap rewards both now and in the future.’

Commenting on the findings, Dr Gary Bolger, Chief Medical Office, AXA PPP healthcare, said: ‘In moderation, little treats – the occasional chocolate bar or a glass of wine – are a part of everyday life and can have a big effect on our happiness and frame of mind.

‘The flipside, however, is that over-indulgence can add up to a significant and detrimental impact on the body.

‘The dangers of cigarette smoking are well known and the ideal scenario for anyone’s health is not to smoke at all, but giving up for Lent and proving to yourself that you can cope with not smoking for 46 days, is a fantastic start.

‘There are few of us who are not tempted by the seductive power of a chocolate bar. However, over-indulgence can lead to manifold health problems.

‘Altogether, the average UK adult will consume 12,804 calories from chocolate and alcohol during Lent. Cutting down or cutting out unhealthy habits for a 46 day period can make a difference and, better still, help give individuals confidence to stick with the positive changes they’ve made and live a healthier lifestyle for the rest of the year.’
