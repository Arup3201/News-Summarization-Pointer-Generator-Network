It is Britain’s most famous murder mystery and a puzzle that has occupied criminologists for more than a century.

But modern crime experts think they have finally decoded part of the Jack the Ripper conundrum using a computer algorithm - and suggest detectives may have been very close to solving the murders at the time.

Dr Kim Rossmo, a former Canadian police officer who has pioneered the use of geographical profiling, thinks he has pinpointed the very street where the Ripper lived while he was terrorising London in the autumn of 1888.

A former Canadian police officer who pioneered the use of geographical profiling, thinks the Ripper lived on Flower and Dean Street in Whitechapel, East London. The bustling street is pictured here in 1902

Using mathematical computer models which take the murderer’s known movements and calculate his likely geographical base, Dr Rossmo has worked out that the killer probably lived in Flower and Dean Street.

It was part of a slum in Whitechapel, East London.

'This was the vice-ridden neighbourhood that East End social reformers referred to as the “wicked quarter-mile,"' Dr Rossmo said.

All five victims lived in doss houses within 200 yards (183 metres) of the road and frequented the nearby Ten Bells Pub at Spitalfields Market.

The street was destroyed in the Blitz.

Using mathematical computer models which take the murderer’s known movements and calculate his likely geographical base, Dr Rossmo has worked out that the killer probably lived in Flower and Dean Street, a slum area in the Whitechapel area of East London.

In 1888, detectives conducted door-to-door inquiries along Flower and Dean Street in the wake of the five murders, but came up with nothing and turned their attention to other areas.

Dr Rossmo, speaking at the Cheltenham Science Festival yesterday, said that each of the five victims had lived in doss houses within 200 yards (183 metres) of the road and had each frequented the Ten Bells Pub at Spitalfields Market, which was close by.

The criminologist, whose geographical profiling techniques are now used by police forces around the world, said: ‘Flower and Dean Street was destroyed in the Blitz and no longer exists as it used to. But in 1888 it lay between Commercial Street to the west and Brick Lane to the east, north of Whitechapel Road.

Jack the Ripper murdered five victims in 1888.

‘During the time of the Whitechapel murders it contained several doss houses.  

‘This was the vice-ridden neighbourhood that East End social reformers referred to as the “wicked quarter-mile”.’

Using the sites of each of the murders and the location of a scrap of bloody clothing found nearby, Dr Rossmo used an algorithm to calculate the likely routes the killer had taken on the days of each murder and his most probable base.

He found that Flower and Dean Street is likely to have been his home, and at the very least would have been a frequent haunt.

Dr Rossmo, who helped West Yorkshire Police capture and prosecute serial rapist Clive Barwell in the 1990s, said: ‘I would be very surprised indeed if the Ripper had not had some involvement with Flower and Dean Street. He might have lived there, drank there, picked up prostitutes there, he might have had a relative there. There is a high chance it was within his area of activity.’

He said police at the time and ‘Ripperologists’ since had wrongly built their investigations around their suspects, rather than strictly following the evidence.

‘This is one of the biggest cause of wrongful convictions – choosing an early suspect and building a case around that. You need to follow the evidence.’

But he said the killer, who mutilated his five female victims after strangling them, will now almost certainly never be identified.

‘The only way we could find who the Ripper is now is if there is a piece of evidence squirrelled away in the Scotland Yard files, which we might get a piece of DNA from. You would then need to find a relative to compare it to, it is a very long shot.’

He said the Ripper probably died, was taken into a mental asylum or was imprisoned for another crime – and dismissed theories that suggest the killer was linked to the Royal Family.

‘This man was almost certainly anonymous. His psychological profile suggests he was poor, he lived or worked in Whitechapel and he had a menial job. He was not an aristocrat.’

Dr Rossmo, who started his career as a police officer with Vancouver Police and is now based at the criminal justice department at Texas State University, is working with British academics to apply his geographical profiling techniques to disciplines of healthcare and wildlife conservation.

Dr Steven Le Comber, a biological mathematician at Queen Mary University in London, has refined Dr Rossmo’s computer model to track populations of invasive species, outbreaks of infectious diseases and even mosquito breeding grounds.

He told the Cheltenham audience: ‘This is genuinely exciting – using these techniques can really make a difference for public health.’

Detectives investigating crimes including gruesome murders may have a new tool in their crime fighting kit soon as Dutch forensic experts have discovered how to accurately date fingerprints.

They think their innovation could let police date crime scene prints from years ago.

‘It's not quite the Holy Grail of fingerprinting, but it's a very important discovery,’ Marcel de Puit, a fingerprint researcher at the Dutch Forensic Institute (NFI), told AFP.

‘Being able to date the prints means you can determine when a potential suspect was at the crime scene or which fingerprints are relevant for the investigation.’

Fingerprints leave nearly-unique marks on a surface that can be copied and compared to a database to identify a suspect - a police technique that rose to prominence in the early 1900s.

The prints themselves are made up of sweat and grease, including a complex mix of cholesterol, amino acids and proteins.

‘The chemicals in these fingerprints can be analysed. Some disappear over time and it's the relative proportions of these chemicals that allow us to date a fingerprint,’ De Puit said.

Previous attempts to crack the formula for dating fingerprints failed because they focused on the amounts of chemicals, rather than their relative proportions.

Taking into account the temperature of the original prints' surroundings, which affects the speed of deterioration, forensic experts can now date fingerprints to within ‘one or two days’.

The new technique needs to be extensively tested on real crimes scenes, leading to the creation of a database, before it can be used in prosecutions.
