Australian fashion designer Ruth Tarvydas, pictured at her catwalk show in Perth Fashion Week in 2010,  has been found dead outside her East Perth apartment

Australian fashion designer Ruth Tarvydas had faced financial woes in the years leading up to her death on Friday and reportedly owed the bank almost $1million.

Ms Tarvydas was found dead outside her East Perth apartment at 8am on Friday morning.

The designer, aged in her late 60s, had become increasingly reclusive after her label RTI was liquidated last August, according to Sydney Confidential.

Ms Tarvydas was forced to close the doors of her high-profile King Street boutique in Perth’s CBD in 2012 after it went into administration – leaving her with as little as $200 in the bank.

The designer owed ANZ Banking Group nearly $1million, which the bank sought following the store’s closure, Perth Now reports.

She told Perth radio station 92.9 back in 2012 that she had to sell her house and blamed high rent, roadworks and a sluggish retail sector for sending her business into administration after her bank withdrew financial support.

The collapse of her business was the subject of a six-part ABC documentary, Boomtown, in December.

She said at the time she wanted to use her appearance in the documentary to show off her designs to new audiences in the hope it would encourage them to buy her $500 to $1000 dresses.

Ms Tarvydas said she was trying to pull her head in financially and started renting back her East Perth apartment late last year.

She was able to keep one of her stores open in Claremont, in Perth’s western suburbs, because her landlord John Bond offered her a special lease.

He said the designer had been under 'enormous economic pressure' and that she experienced a massive blow at the closure of her King Street store.

'She was and remains a founder of high end fashion within Western Australia, and her work has been embraced worldwide,' Mr Bond said.

Ms Tarvydas counted high-profile celebrities among her clients and her pieces have been sold in high-fashion London stores including Selfridges and Harrods in the UK.

Her clients included Jennifer Hawkins, Rihanna, Emma Watson, Amy Winehouse, Jodie Kidd and Rachel Hunter.

One of most well-known designs was the red backless gown Rebecca Judd wore to the 2004 AFL Brownlow Medal awards with her footballer husband Chris Judd.

The dress sparked controversy for its revealing neckline plunging to the navel.

Mrs Judd posted a tribute to the designer on social media on Friday night with a picture of herself wearing the iconic gown.

'You changed my life with your red dress Ruth. RIP beautiful lady x,' she posted on Twitter and Instagram.

'I really looked up to Ruth in so many ways, and it's just such a sad loss for the industry. Ruth really was the first West Australian designer to go out there and make her mark internationally,' he said.

'I mean she's part of West Australian history as far as I'm concerned.'

Despite facing 'enormous' financial difficulties, the designer's landlord said she remained positive and determined

'She was such a positive person, even when the chips were down she always said "we'll come out of this". She was such a survivor,' Mr Silvestrin said.

Condolences also came from Perth Lord Mayor Lisa Scaffidi, who said Ms Tarvydas was a Perth treasure.

'And I’m sure she still had a lot of designs still in her. It is a tragic loss for the industry, for our city and for everyone that knows her,' Ms Scaffidi said.

There are several similarities between Ms Tarvydas' death and that of American fashion designer L'Wren Scott, pictured with partner Mick Jagger in December 2013, who died in March.

Ms Tarvydas' shock death has sparked comparisions the recent death of American fashion designer L'Wren Scott on March 17.

The 49-year-old fashion designer was $6 million in debt to her creditors when she died and was distraught and 'embarrassed' over her failing business.

The former model's body was discovered in her Manhattan apartment while her longtime partner, Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, was in Australia for an upcoming tour, which had to be postponed.
