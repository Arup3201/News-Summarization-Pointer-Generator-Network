 A Massachusetts woman is in trouble after she allegedly tried to stop hunting near her house with an air horn.

Julie Carreiro lives near a pond where she says hunters have been trying to shoot local water fowl at early hours in the morning.

Her family were aggravated about being woken up by the sound of gunshot blasts from duck hunters at a nearby pond.

Hunted: Julie Carreiro is in trouble after she allegedly tried to stop hunting with an air horn. The gunshots were so loud they scared so used an air horn to scare the ducks away

She said the gunshots were so loud they scared her, that’s when hunters say she got the air horn to try and scare off the birds so there would be nothing to shoot.

Ms. Carreiro, who has lived in a house in Marshfield,  since 1964, told The Boston Globe that hunting had never been a problem at the Hoyt Hall Preserve until a year ago.

Hunting is not permitted on the area's pond and marshland, but there were never any tree postings warning hunters about the rule.

'The noise just wouldn't end,' Carreiro told The Globe. 'At one point, they weren't hunting, they were just shooting for no reason except to make noise and make it clear they weren’t leaving.'

Last year, Carreiro said her family was woken up by the sound of gun blasts and yelled to the hunters to find a new pond.

'There were some threats that were made and it’s alleged that the family had used an air horn potentially to scare off some of the water fowl that were in the area,' Marshfield Police Chief Phil Tavares said.

Carreiro said she didn’t use the air horn, but that she didn’t want the hunters in the area.

She said her family is not opposed to hunting, but they are opposed to 'being woken up with gunfire raining down on us.'

Bang bang! The Carreiro family were aggravated about being woken up by the sound of gunshot blasts from duck hunters at a nearby pond

A state official said an individual could be charged with hunter harassment if they interfere with someone’s legal right to hunt and police are now investigating whether there is probable cause to charge her. 

The hunters are also being looked at. They could be charged with disturbing the peace for hunting too early and in an area where they technically weren’t allowed to hunt.

'There’s a little bit of a loophole with the law that it’s not posted no hunting. So if it’s not posted no hunting it’s not enforceable,' Tavares said.

Police are also considering charges against the hunters for disturbing the peace.

Signs have since been posted around the pond and the hunter said he will not be returning there to hunt.

Duck hunt: The ducks are welcome now that there's no hunting in Mrs Carreiro's neighborhood, at least they'll be safe
