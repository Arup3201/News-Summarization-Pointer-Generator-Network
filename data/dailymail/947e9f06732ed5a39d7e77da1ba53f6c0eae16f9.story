The moonwalking Shetland pony whose fancy footwork won him an army of fans has lost a paternity battle.

Socks starred in phone company Three’s latest advert, which has now had more than 5.2million views on YouTube.

The 32-inch stallion was put out to stud, but only had eyes for a mare called Kimberley grazing in another field.

Refusing to be deterred, Socks swam 175 yards across a loch in order to reach her.

Despite the dalliance, a DNA test has now revealed that Kimberley’s colt Scamp was actually sired by a rival pony called Nuggett.

Owner Mari Williamson, 42, said: ‘Socks is a bit of a Casanova, but Nuggett has beaten him to it. I will have to contain his enthusiasm for the ladies a bit more next year.’

To rub insult into Socks’ wounded 
pride, Felicity - one of Socks’ mares - has now also given birth to a 
colt appropriately called Scallywag, also courtesy of Nuggett.

Hair from Socks, Scamp and Kimberley were sent for genetic testing at a laboratory on the mainland.

If it had been positive, Scamp would have been the first foal that Socks has fathered since his worldwide fame.

Socks has only been a father once before, when two years ago he fathered a pretty filly called Quartz - who has the same skewbald markings as him.

The commercial for broadband provider Three sees the dancing horse impress other ponies and almost tumble off a cliff  to the 1980s track Everywhere by Fleetwood Mac, before hiding his moves from a local farmer, with the slogan ‘Silly stuff. It matters.’

Mari, 42, who runs the 200-acre Benston stud farm on Shetland, said five-year-old Socks had been unlucky in love - but admitted it was 'a bit like an episode from the Jeremy Kyle show.'

'It has been a bit of a shambles but I am not disappointed - Scamp is a lovely black colt, whoever his father is. The funny thing is he has Socks’s cheeky personality, but the DNA test says he’s Nuggett’s.

'Socks is a very good swimmer. That loch is five-and-a-half feet in places but I will have to think about how to contain his enthusiasm for the ladies a bit more next year.

'He just fancied Kimberley more and thought the grass is always greener on the other side. But it now appears that even Felicity had a romance that day with Nuggett. It was his lucky day.

'There was a bit of fight afterwards between Nuggett and Socks.

'Socks was put in stables for two weeks after. It cost an arm and a leg for the DNA tests but it is important to keep the line correct.'

If Scamp had been Socks’ son, he would have commanded an extra premium when he is sold.

'Scamp is a real character - cheeky and very friendly,' said Mari. 'He is a very good colt. I’m chuffed to bits with him.

'Socks has plenty of years as a stud in him, so we hope for more foals.'

'I would never part with him, no matter how much money I was offered. He is very special to me. Socks just has the presence. He is a very special pony.

'I've had goodwill messages from all over the world for him from Denmark to the USA.

'He has his own Facebook page now with almost 1,200 friends.

'He has taken it all in his stride and got his four hooves firmly on the ground. He loves carrots and apples so he's had a few of those as a reward.'

Newborn: Scamp was born last month on the Shetland Islands

Mari bought Socks from a village near Dalkeith when he was a yearling. She has one other stallion - Nuggett - and eight mares.

Socks was even given the VIP treatment during his famous TV shoot by having his own hairdresser who attached 40 clips to his mane for each day of filming.

Socks was prepared for his starring role for two weeks by local animal trainer Elaine Tait, who taught him to ‘moonwalk’ by giving him his favourite carrots as gifts.

The advert was filmed by award-winning filmmaker Dougal Wilson, famed for his festive ads for John Lewis.

One of Mari’s other ponies, Hugh, also starred on the advert, which launched during Coronation Street earlier this year.

Mari and Socks have also been invited as guests of honour at the prestigious UK Championships of the Coloured Horse and Pony Society in Grantham, Lincolnshire, in August.
