The second U.S. Ebola victim is back on American soil after her plane landed at Bangor International Airport in Maine early on Tuesday.

The plane refueled at 8am after arriving from Liberia on its journey to Atlanta, Georgia where missionary worker Nancy Writebol will be treated.

Mrs Writebol, from North Carolina, left Monrovia airport in West Africa early on Tuesday on a chartered plane.

She will be treated at Emory University Hospital along with fellow missionary and doctor Dr Kent Brantly in a special quarantine wing.

Mrs Writebol's son, Jeremy, said his mother 'is still struggling' but that 'there seems to be improvement'.

The two Americans infected with Ebola are getting an experimental drug so novel it has never been tested for safety in humans.

The aid worker is reportedly in a stable condition after receiving a second dose of the drug.

Ebola has killed at least 887 people in four West African countries in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. 

Mrs Writebol has shown some improvement 
over the weekend. She can walk with assistance and asked for Liberian 
potato soup - her favorite meal, family and friends said.

However, her case remains grave. She is in serious condition with a disease that has no known cure and proves fatal for up to 90 per cent of patients.

Jeremy Writebol believes his mother can yield a greater good from her impending return to the United States amid West Africa's worst-ever outbreak of the virus.

The attention focused on her case 'might help develop a cure and resources to help those who are suffering,' Mr Writebol said. 'I am sure hopeful for that.'

Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol contracted 
Ebola after working on the same medical mission team treating victims of
 the virus around Monrovia, Liberia.

More than 1,300 people have been 
stricken, killing at least 729 of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra 
Leone.

Ebola has no vaccine or antidote. However, both Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol were given an experimental treatment last week, according to international relief group Samaritan's Purse.

The group originally said that only Writebol got the treatment. Dr Brantly also received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy, an Ebola survivor, who had been under his care, according to the organization.

Emory, where Brantly already is quarantined, boasts one of the nation's most sophisticated infectious disease units. Patients are sealed off from anyone not in protective gear.

Lab tests are conducted inside the unit, ensuring that viruses don't leave the quarantined area. Family members see and communicate with patients through barriers.

Mrs Writebol and her husband, David, had been in Liberia since August 2013, sent there by the Christian organization SIM USA and sponsored by their home congregation at Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina.

At the hospital where Brantly treated patients, Nancy Writebol worked as a hygienist whose role included decontaminating those entering or leaving the Ebola treatment area. Their pastor, the Reverend John Munro, said David Writebol fulfilled administrative and technical duties.

A few weeks before she was diagnosed, Jeremy Writebol said, a doctor visited the Monrovia hospital where she worked and praised the decontamination procedures as the best he'd seen.

Jeremy Writebol said she was 'really pleased by knowing that' and never thought she would be infected, despite her proximity to the virus.

David and Nancy Writebol have engaged in foreign missions for 15 years, spending five years in Ecuador and nine years in Zambia, where Munro said they worked in a home for widows and orphans.

Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention, also in Atlanta, say they've been criticized for bringing Ebola cases to an American hospital.

But Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director, emphasized again on Sunday that there is no threat to the public in the United States.

Some airlines that serve those nations have suspended flights, while international groups, including the Peace Corps, have evacuated some or all representatives in the region.

But the Writebols, their pastor predicted, won't be away from the stricken land for any longer than they have to be.

'They knew that Liberia was a tough assignment,' he said, comparing their vocation to the Bible's stories of leper colonies.

'Followers of Christ went into those colonies, knowing they would die,' Munro said.

'I certainly wouldn't judge them if they didn't go back, but I don't think this will deter them.'

Quarantine facilities around the U.S: A widespread Ebola outbreak in the country is 'not in the cards', the CDC director said. That is partly down to the number of quarantine facilities, where the CDC can legally detain anyone who might have been exposed to a number of diseases
