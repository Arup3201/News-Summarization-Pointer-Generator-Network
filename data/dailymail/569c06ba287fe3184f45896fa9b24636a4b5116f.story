The mother of the heaviest baby born in the U.S. this year recalls her painful final weeks, when she could barely leave her bed.

Utah mother Sara Brandon gave birth to son Joel Brandon Jr (nicknamed J.J.) on May 9 at Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem and she and her husband were shocked when he weighed in at 14lbs. For comparison, that's the weight of a typical Thanksgiving Turkey.

'It's painful let me tell ya,' she told Good Morning America today. 'My last couple weeks I really couldn't get out of bed.'

Bath time: Utah mom Sara Brandon gave birth to son J.J. in May and he weighed 14lbs - the heaviest born this year in the U.S.

Not what we were expecting: Both parents were 'shocked' by the weight of their baby

Now six months old, J.J. has nearly doubled in weight to 24 lbs - just two pounds shy of his two-year-old sisters.

While J.J. isn't the biggest baby born in the world this year, he has been confirmed as the heaviest baby born in the U.S. The largest all-around baby is believed to be England's George King who weighed 15 pounds 7 ounces.

'It really was just a big surprise for us - how large he was,' J.J.'s father said.

Because of his size, he needed two doctors to help with the caesarian-section birth, rather than one, and required special maneuvering as he was 'so big and crammed in there', she told the Huffington Post.

After he was born, he suffered respiratory problems and needed to spend a week in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. But he has since returned home and is in good health, his mother said.

At his last check-up, J.J.'s doctor said he was in the 150th percentile for height and weight for his age group - and he's so big that he is wearing the same sized diapers of his twin sisters, aged 2.

KSL reported that his size could be because of his mother's Type 1 diabetes or simply because of her family's history of big babies and her husband's height.

But doctors said that as J.J. grows and becomes a toddler he'll slim down closer to average size.

'He's just on his own little scale,' his father said. 'You just have to accept that.'

'This big bubba melts my heart,' Brandon said. 'I love him more than I ever imagined I could love a sweet baby boy. He is my squishy cuddle bug.'

Brandon joked that she doesn't think she can have normal sized babies as her two-year-old twins were born weighing just 4lbs each.

She added that the girls love to play with him - although they can't hold him on their own.
