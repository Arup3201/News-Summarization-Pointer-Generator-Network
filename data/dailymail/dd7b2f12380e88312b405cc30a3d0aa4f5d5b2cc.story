As Obama prepares to pull all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by 2015, NATO’s secretary-general has warned against a full withdrawal.

President Obama has made clear his desire to draw down troops from the war-torn nation by year's end, and the U.S. and NATO may not be left with a choice as Afghan leader Hamid Karzai still refuses to sign a security agreement.

NATO’s Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said that a full withdrawal of NATO troops is not desirable and that it would be detrimental to the people of Afghanistan.

Barack Obama may be playing a game of chicken with Hamid Karzai, designed to force the Afghan leader's hand before he passes off power later this year

NATO defence ministers agreed on 
Thursday to plan for all options for the alliance's future presence in 
Afghanistan, including a possible pullout of all its troops this year, 
Fogh Rasmussen said.

‘Today 
we agreed the need to plan for all possible outcomes including the 
possibility that we may not be able to deploy to Afghanistan after 2014 
due to the persistent delays we have seen,’ the NATO Secretary-General 
told a news conference.

On Wednesday, Rasmussen said he still hoped plans to keep troops in Afghanistan beyond this year could be salvaged.

‘Let
 me be clear that this is not the outcome we want,’ Rasmussen said, 
referring to the option of no NATO troops staying behind in Afghanistan 
after this year.

‘It is not 
the outcome we think is in the interest of the Afghan people. However, 
it might be the unfortunate outcome if there is no security agreement in
 due time. This is what is at stake.’

Taliban insurgents continue to rain destruction on Afghanistan's cities and villages, continuing the West's quest to deploy just the right amount of muscle in response

Sad sack? Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel had to tell reporters on Monday that U.S. military strength would be pared back to ts levels in 1940

Without
 going as far as the zero option, NATO could also look at scaling back 
its current plan, which calls for a training mission headquartered in 
Kabul and four regional bases, and focus instead on the capital, 
diplomats say

In the U.S. 
Tuesday marked the first time a scenario has been discussed publicly 
that would completely void Afghanistan of U.S. personnel who have been 
vital in fighting Taliban militias.

'President
 Obama has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has adequate plans in 
place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should 
the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014,' the 
White House said Tuesday morning.

That
 message was part of a phone call between Obama and Afghan leader Hamid 
Karzai on Tuesday, during which the U.S. president reportedly pressured 
him to accept the terms of a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) that has
 been pending for months.

The
 Obama administration has made the agreement, drafted in November, a 
requirement if it is to leave a counter-terrorism force in Karzai's 
country after the larger U.S. pullout is complete.

Karzai has been putting off the decision to sign the BSA, saying that it should be left for his successor.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai wants to pass the decision about an American security agreement to his successor, but that may leave a US-dependent NATO with too little time to plan its 2015 deployments

Elections will be held in April to choose the next president.

But
 that process could drag on for months since Afghanistan's presidential 
election process is a two-stage system that may not be complete until 
July or August.

A
 Defense Department source told MailOnline that existing Pentagon plans 
call for as many as 10,000 troops to remain behind, split between 
training forces and special operators equipped to raid Taliban 
strongholds.

But
 those plans are fluid. And since so many NATO allies in Afghanistan 
depend on U.S. troops for logistical support and just-in-time war 
materiel, those world powers are finding it hard to plan without a clear
 nod from the Americans.

And
 Obama's decision is already limiting the choices of a NATO panel of 
defense ministers meeting this week in Brussels, Belgium.

The
 NATO group is weighing how many troops to place in Afghanistan next 
year, and the political tug-of-war between Washington and Kabul promises
 to wreak havoc with those plans.

If
 Karzai's successor isn't in place until the end of the summer, the 
Pentagon source cautioned, NATO will find itself in a time crunch with 
just months or weeks left to finalize deployment decisions.

U.S. troops are a common sight -- for now -- in Kabul, where at least one person was killed and four others were wounded during a bombing

Most
 of the major-party contenders for the Afghan presidency have spoken in 
favor of the U.S. agreement, but NATO generals and the Pentagon don't 
want to premise billions of dollars in logistical moves on the uncertain
 outcome of a Middle Eastern election.

'We will leave open the possibility of concluding a BSA with Afghanistan later this year,' the White House said Tuesday.

Ouch: Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Tuesday that President Obama would rather spend federal dollars on food stamps than on a strong military

'However,
 the longer we go without a BSA, the more challenging it will be to plan
 and execute any U.S. mission. Furthermore, the longer we go without a 
BSA, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 U.S. mission will be 
smaller in scale and ambition.'

Karzai has been cantankerous and his commitments have become more elusive as the U.S. has withdrawn platoon after platoon. But the Pentagon knows that he can't run for the top post again.

His war of words with Obama may be a case of one lame duck speaking to another – the worst circumstance for Obama's latest move if it's just an Oval Office bluff.

The Defense Department, however, insists that the president may actually order a complete withdrawal after the NATO meeting in Belgium, where Secretary of State Chuck Hagel will represent U.S. interests.

'Without question, the issues surrounding the future of the Afghan mission will certainly be discussed in Brussels, to include the challenges of retrograde and force posture faced by all Allies,' Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told The Guardian.

'We long said that we would like a BSA as soon as possible. Absent that,' he vowed, 'we would have to start planning to withdraw all our forces by the end of the year.'
