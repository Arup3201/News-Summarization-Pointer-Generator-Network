Art fans better be sure to turn the thermostat down as this sculptor can't take the heat.

Nick Elphick, 35, creates his incredibly accurate sculptures using chocolate as his main medium.

Nick's cocoa creations include a six foot tall sculpture of the Queen's head and a 15kg carving of Motorhead lead vocalist Lemmy Kilmister.

The full-time sculptor, from Llandudno, north Wales, has even created a number of animal sculptures using the tasty treat.

Nick's sweet sculptures have been earning him quite the name for himself, so much so that the artist has even been approached by his celebrity subjects.

'Lemmy heard that I was doing the sculpture of him and I was told he was interested in it.

Nick's sculptures can take him up to five months to complete in full  

Nick works with chocolate in a similar way sculptors work with clay 

'I invited him down and presented it to him - it was an incredible moment. I've never felt to starstruck before - he's a really genuine guy.

'I was always a fan of his music growing up and he used to live and work in north Wales so it was a great thing to do for him.'

Nick's devotion to his idol was second to none with the piece taking him almost half a year to complete in full.  

'It took around five months to complete - around the same amount of time it took to make the bronze head of the Queen.

One the projects that Nick is most proud of is his sculptures of Lemmy Kilmister from Motorhead 

Lemmy heard about Nick's project and was so interested in his work that he came to see the piece himself 

'I did that one especially for the Jubilee in 2012 so it was a very special sculpture.'

As well as his celebrity tributes Nick has also created an impressive range of animal sculptures include a giant-sized dog head, a lion and a deer carving.

The vast scale of his work means that Nick has to dedicate an ample amount of time and money to his craft. 

'I have to sacrifice a lot to be able to commit to being an artist and sculptor.

'It's not cheap at all - I've been sculpting things for 20 years and there are always new challenges.' 

Nick says that his sculptures are edible and you could potentially nibble on them 

'They take a lot of time and effort to make - I sometime find that I lose myself in the work.

'But I'm a real perfectionist to I've taken between two and six months on some pieces of work - it's vital that they're done to the highest standard possible.'

Nick has created several successful models now but says it is hard to choose which one he likes the best. 

'It's hard to say which ones are my favourite because I've done so many.

'But the punks ones are definitely fun to look at because they're so quirky.'

Nick has began to experiment more and more with the cocoa treat and says that technically his sculptures are edible.

'More and more of my pieces are being made from chocolate so in theory you could actually nibble on them.'
