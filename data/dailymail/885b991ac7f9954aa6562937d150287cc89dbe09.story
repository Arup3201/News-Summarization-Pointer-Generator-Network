Rudi Garcia could be the right man for the job at Arsenal should they choose to part ways with current manager Arsene Wenger, according to Ray Parlour.

Airing his views in a Q&A on Sportlobster.com, the former Gunners midfielder spoke about Garcia's credentials as a manager as Wenger's future at the club grows more and more uncertain.

'That will be the hardest decision the club have to make. They need to have a replacement lined up,' Parlour wrote.

Having won just two major trophies since 2005, fans at the Emirates stadium are growingly becoming frustrated with Wenger, whose side have won just three out of their last seven Premier League games this season.

'(Jurgen) Klopp is having a bad time this season, but someone of his calibre is needed. He changes his tactics and has been in the Champions League before.' 

'Roma's Rudi Garcia is another good manager. Wenger will have a say in who is brought in. He built the club up, won trophies and oversaw the new stadium.' 

The north Londoners are sixth in the Premier League table, 12 points adrift of leaders Chelsea and four points away from a Champions League spot.

Contrarily, as Wenger's fellow countryman Garcia continues to transform his team into serious title contenders, Roma currently sit second in Serie A three points behind last season's champions Juventus.

With the January transfer window just around the corner, Parlour was also at hand to reveal who he thought Arsenal should bring in to improve their chances of Champions League qualification. 

'Winston Reid has been mentioned, but I'm not sure he's the winner and a good player.

'For midfield, I would go for (Morgan) Schneiderlin if you can get him. He's at a good age. Lots of players are linked.

'(Sami) Khedira would have been great. Players that have played in big games won't be phased by anything. Schneiderlin hasn't, but I can see him improving.'
