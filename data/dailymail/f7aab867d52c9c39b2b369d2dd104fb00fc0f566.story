A devastated homeowner is facing a $100,000 repair bill to her new property after teenagers advertised her address on Facebook, broke in and held a wild party.

The 37-year-old woman had only just bought the four-bedroom house - her first family home - and was still renovating it on the day 70 teens destroyed it, breaking windows, doors and putting holes in the walls.

'It's disgusting they have damaged everything,' the mother of one, who didn't want to be named, told MailOnline from outside her wrecked home in Kambah, a suburb of Canberra.

Smashed: A female new homeowner is faced with a huge $100,000 repair bill after teens caused reckless devastation to her home in Canberra

'We just bought the house and were renovating it this week.

The woman bought the property on June 2 for $452,000 as her first family home with her husband and 13-year-old son, who was not involved in the party.

She is currently renting a home nearby and had been decorating her new house on Tuesday before around 70 hooligans, aged 15-18, threw a party at around 9pm and wreaked havoc throughout the house.

Describing the moment she arrived at her new home to discover the destruction, she said the first thing she noticed was the seven police cars outside the house.

'There were broken windows everywhere. They took us through the house. We were just in shock,' she said.Â 

Mess: The hooligans sprayed ketchup over the walls in the house on the same day that the walls had been newly painted

Smashed: There is smashed glass everywhere and all of the four bedrooms have been destroyed, with cabinets and curtains left strewn on the floor

Spotless: The house, seen here in photos from the estate agent's website, only needed minor decoration updates when the family bought it and now it is ruined

The family were hoping to move in next week and now have to wait for their insurance company to fix the $100,000 worth of estimated damage.

'Every single one of the rooms is wrecked. Every wall and every window is smashed. There is paint thrown on the deck, it's not pretty,' she said.

The woman described how there was alcohol left scattered around the house, including 'cider, beer and bourbon' and 'glass everywhere'.

She also said there was 'tomato sauce sprayed over the walls'.

Kicked in: Every single wall in the Canberra house now has holes in it since the 70 teenagers tore through the property on Tuesday night

Unrecognisable: The family's new home will now take months of repairs before they can move in. The kitchen units were torn and wires exposed

The woman was shocked to find smashed glass everywhere when police called her to explain there had been a party at her house

'We only bought the sauce yesterday as we had lunch in the house after we had been painting,' she explained, highlighting how her family's hardwork has been ruined.

The woman has no idea who the teens who threw the party are and said she was told by police it was organised on Facebook.

She believes the party-goers knew the house was empty after spotting a 'sold' sign outside in recent weeks.

'All the people had scattered when we got here at around 9.30pm,' she said.

She urged those responsible to have a 'slight conscious and come forward'.

The 37-year-old woman, who does not wish to be named, exchanged on the property on June 2 for $452,000 as her first family home

Devastation: A huge hole was kicked in the toilet door and the bathroom window was also smashed in

Describing the moment she arrived at her new home to discover the destruction the woman said the first thing she noticed was the seven police cars outside the house

Windows were broken, doors pulled off, walls kicked in, light fittings smashed and property in the backyard was damaged, according to ACT police, adding the damage was a 'wanton display of senseless vandalism'.

When officers arrived at the property just after 9pm on Tuesday they saw numerous cars parked on the street and a large number of teens fleeing the area.

Police are also urging the teens to turn themselves in.

The vehicle registrations of several fleeing cars were noted and will be followed up on, police say.

'It would be better for them to come forward than wait for police to come knock on their door,' Sergeant Mark Rowswell said.

Pushed over: The teens new the house was empty because of the 'sold sign' outside the house which had been there since June

Destroyed: The house had only just been bought when teenagers caused $100,000 of damage. Police are urging the teens to turn themselves in

Before: Photos of the home on a real estate website before it was sold to its new owner show it in a much better condition

When it was clean and tidy: One of the four bedroom's ensuite bathrooms and one of the bedrooms before the old family moved out
