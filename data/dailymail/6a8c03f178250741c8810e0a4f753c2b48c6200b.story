Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta has claimed Real Madrid ARE interested in signing midfielder Paul Pogba.

Carlo Ancelotti told Sky Italia that he was an admirer of the 21-year-old, but insisted the Champions League winners did not intend to make a move for the former Manchester United youngster.

However, Maratto has accused Ancelotti of telling a 'white lie' and insists the Italian has made enquiries about Pogba.

Juventus claim Real Madrid have shown an interest in midfielder Paul Pogba

Carlo Ancelotti has been accused of telling a 'white lie' after he denied interest in his compatriot

'Ancelotti asked me some questions about Pogba,' he said to Sky Italia. 'He says he's not interested? Well, that's a white lie. I'm sure he has his reasons to say it's not true.'

Juve are desperate to fend off interest in the French international, but Marotta insists they are powerless to stop Pogba, who has scored five goals  in 16 Serie A games this season, being lured elsewhere with a massive financial offer.

He added: 'We will do everything within out limits to hold on to Pogba, but we must not forget Italy is a country in transition.

Juventus are desperate to keep Pogba at the San Siro but admit he may be prized away

'The problem we have is that of offers coming in from other clubs offering him a salary that we are not able to match due to our financial situation.

'At the moment, there's no reason to believe that Pogba will definitely leave Juventus for another team, but we have to bear in mind that we cannot compete with the wages that are being paid elsewhere. We have our limits.'
