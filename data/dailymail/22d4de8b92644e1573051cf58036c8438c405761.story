They are the most celebrated Home Guard platoon in history, a band of men who changed the course of television comedy, if not actually the course of the war.

But here they are as we never saw them at the time – Dad’s Army, out on manoeuvres in the wilds of Walmington-on-Sea.

In a rare photographic record, cast members of the legendary series are shown mixing with locals in the fictional seaside town as they record episodes that will later delight audiences around the globe.

But the backdrop is not exactly the coastal front line against Hitler’s planned invasion during World War II. Don’t tell ‘em, Pike, but it’s the countryside around Thetford in Norfolk, where most of the filming took place. And as these images suggest (to borrow a phrase from Corporal Jones) the natives certainly seem to like it up ‘em.

James Beck poses with extras from the Thetford Am Dram Society. Keith Eldred, the leader of the society, was often called on to provide extras for scenes and recalls that his actors were usually paid £10 per day

They posed for pictures with the cast, went to parties with them, enjoyed dinner dates together after appearing as extras in dozens of episodes – and occasionally kept the stars supplied with liberal quantities of alcohol.

Now, as filming is about to start elsewhere on a big-screen remake of the comedy classic, the Dad’s Army Appreciation Society – membership 1,400 and rising – has turned the clock back nearly half a century to the days when Captain Mainwaring and his fearless men first invaded the inland market town.

David Croft, who co-wrote the series with Jimmy Perry and lived in neighbouring Suffolk, asked the chairman of the local amateur dramatic society in the late 1960s to assemble extras for the series. ‘I quickly became very popular,’

Keith Eldred, now president of the Thetford Players, told the Daily Mail yesterday. ‘When we started to be paid, I became even more popular.

'I drafted in extras from all sorts of places – the drama society, the golf club, friends, my wife… even my parents featured in one episode.’

In total, hundreds of people were involved, including an entire Scout troop and the local Women’s Institute.

Mr Eldred, now 79, entertained the cast one day at a party in his house, which appeared in some of the backdrops. (The retired chartered surveyor’s wife Margot recalled: ‘They drunk us out of whisky and gin and everything else, but we didn’t mind.’)

Mr Eldred continued: ‘They all signed our visitors’ book. They were charming company but they didn’t pull punches. John Le Mesurier was playing my piano and complained it was a rotten piano and was out of tune. It seemed to get better after a couple of gin and tonics though.’

'James Beck [who played spivvy Private Joe Walker in the first series] was constantly chatting up all the girls. Clive Dunn [Corporal Jones] had what Mr Eldred described as ‘a rather cracking wife who used to insist on sunbathing in bikinis’. 

He added: ‘They were all lovely people. Most of the days involved us sitting around for long periods while they set up a shot, so some days were long and boring. But it was great fun, and quite an exciting time for our little community in Thetford.’

Virtually all the best loved episodes feature Norfolk extras in non-speaking parts or background scenes. In ‘The Test’, the platoon is challenged to a cricket match by the ARP wardens, who have recruited a top class bowler to their ranks (played by England cricketer Fred Trueman). 

Mr Eldred played short leg to Capt Mainwaring. ‘Trueman bowled one ball, which was all he was required to do,’ said Mr Eldred. ‘He then spent the rest of the day regaling us with some very doubtful stories about his career in Yorkshire cricket.’

At ease, soldier: John Laurie, who played Private James Frazer, is pictured during filming for the Battle Of The Giants episode at Frog Hill on the MOD Training Area in Norfolk

Expert camouflage: Bill Pertwee, dressed as Chief Warden Hodges, plays around on set during filming in Wacton. The crew used Rosalyn Barrett's house (pictured) for filming, and while she was only paid £10, Mr Pertwee agreed to take her and her husband out for dinner

Keith Eldred, the head of a Am Dram society near to where filming took place, became a popular fixture on set. He recalled that James Beck (pictured) 'was constantly chatting up all the girls'

In ‘Round and Round Went the Great Big Wheel’, the platoon is chosen to help test the War Office’s latest secret weapon. Some of the filming took place in Rosalyn Barrett’s garden in Wacton, a small village south of Norwich. 

‘There wasn’t much happening in Wacton in the 1970s so it was quite something,’ she said yesterday. ‘I think we got paid £10 for a day’s filming, which didn’t exactly change our lives. But Bill Pertwee [Warden Hodges] came round to take me and my husband out for a meal, which was lovely. They were such pleasant people to be with, not uppity at all.’

Mrs Barrett, 65, still has a Kodak Brownie snapshot of herself with cast members, including one that shows her arm in arm with the ‘delightful’ John Le Mesurier. And her house is firmly on the Dad’s Army map – ‘Every now and then we get a coachload of fans coming by on tour,’ she said.

The series ran for nine years from 1968 and pulled in 18million viewers at its peak. It is still being shown on mainstream TV and attracts new generations of followers every year.

The photographs are the only known record of the Thetford days, however – the BBC is said either to have ditched or lost any it might have had in its archives, along with the list of filming locations.

Clive Dunn stands with a local girl in Bardwell, Suffolk. The images were collected by the Dad’s Army Appreciation Society secretary Tony Pritchard, who went to locations where the series was filmed and asked for snapshots

They were obtained by Dad’s Army Appreciation Society secretary Tony Pritchard, who spent nine years researching precise locations for a companion guide to the series. He traced many of those who allowed TV crews to use their land, property or services, and collected snapshots they took at the time.

The prints are now part of the society’s display of recreated sets, vehicles and memorabilia at Bressingham Steam Museum in Diss, Norfolk.

One shows Arthur Lowe, in full Captain Mainwaring uniform but with a cigarette dangling uncharacteristically from his lips, signing his name for two young autograph hunters. Another shows actor James Beck in 1970s civvies as he relaxes with two clearly delighted am-dram stars in the making.

Thetford being 50 miles from the sea, Great Yarmouth, Wisbeach and Lowestoft were used for some locations (how else might a German U-Boat crew get to Walmington?); and Thetford station became Walmington-on-Sea station whenever required. The closest the cast got to the heavily guarded wartime English Channel was Brighton, where filming was relocated during a 1973 BBC strike.

‘The appeal of Dad’s Army is that it’s simple fun,’ Mr Pritchard said. ‘It’ s not vulgar or nasty – it’s just clever, straightforward, timeless humour… with brilliant writing and a magical cast that just came together so naturally.’

Only Ian Lavender – immortalised as ‘stupid boy’ Private Pike – survives as one of the seven main platoon characters. But reinforcements are on hand. 

As revealed in the Mail last week, seven new actors are lined up for a big screen remake of Dad’s Army, with Toby Jones, from Hunger Games, playing Capt Mainwaring, and filming is expected to start soon in Bridlington, Yorkshire.

The proposal has provoked anger from some fans. Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Pritchard, who has met the directors, is not among the dissenters. ‘They know what they’re dealing with,’ he said. ‘They fully understand that it’s a national treasure.’
