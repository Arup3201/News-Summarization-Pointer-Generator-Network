A British quantum physicist who was tipped to win a Nobel prize was killed just an hour after arriving in Australia by a joyrider high on cannabis, an inquest has heard.

Cancer survivor and charity volunteer Dr Sean Barrett, 36, was killed when a stolen 4x4 driven by Antony Fogarty jumped at least two red lights at speeds of up to 100mph and ploughed into his taxi.

The vehicle hit the scientist's cab with such force it was sent skidding 45 metres down the road, the inquest in Manchester was told.

The lecturer and researcher, who worked at Imperial College London, was killed instantly along with 28-year-old taxi driver and expectant father Kuldeep Singh on their journey from Perth Airport to the city.

Cancer survivor and charity volunteer Dr Sean Barrett, 36, was killed when a stolen 4x4 driven by Antony Fogarty jumped at least two red lights at speeds of up to 100mph and ploughed into his taxi in Australia

Fogarty, 24, was high on a cocktail of cannabis and also amphetamine at the time of the 2am crash and was being tracked by police helicopter.

He was also subject to a three-year driving disqualification and had never held a Western Australia driving licence. 

He later pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter and was jailed for 11 years last January. He will be eligible for parole in nine years. 

At an inquest in Manchester on Monday in which a coroner recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing, Fogarty was condemned as a 'repulsive monster' by Dr Barrett's mother Janet.

She said the Cambridge University graduate, who held a prestigious Royal Society research fellowship, was thought by many at Imperial College to be capable of winning a Nobel Prize. 

She added that he believed his work, which included plans to build the world's first quantum computer and mathematical analysis of cancer treatments, could 'change the world beyond all imagination'.

He had recently recovered from cancer himself and was an active fundraiser for Macmillan.

Originally from Salford but living in London at the time of his death, Dr Barrett's work took him all over the world and during his time in Australia he was due to give a speech at the University of Western Australia on quantum physics.

Former art teacher Mrs Barrett said: 'He could have got 22 years to life yet he only got 11. I don't understand it. He killed two people. It was two counts of manslaughter but he will out in no time unless somebody blocks his parole. He will come out and kill somebody else. That's my view on the repulsive monster who killed my son.'

Mrs Barrett, who also has a 38-year-old daughter Katie who is a teacher in Milan, added: 'Sean was more than brilliant - he was an important man.

'He was an achiever, an accomplished theoretical physicist, a graduate of Cambridge, a research fellow, doing research and teaching at Imperial College London. 

'They thought he would have gone on to win a Nobel Prize. The fact he had been awarded a Royal Society fellowship allowed him to do what he wanted to do. He had a brilliant mind and he was a special person.

'He was working on a hard problem and he believed that the solution would change the world beyond all imagination. He was thinking that it would perhaps save the planet. Finally, he was a humane, kind, gentle genius who tried to change this world for the better. His family and friends find it impossible to sum up what he meant to us and what his death means.'

At an inquest in Manchester on Monday in which a coroner recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing, Fogarty was condemned as a 'repulsive monster' by Dr Barrett's mother Janet

The inquest was held as Dr Barrett died on Friday October 19 2012 but there had been a lengthy delay waiting for the criminal proceedings to conclude and for documents to be delivered to England. 

A post-mortem concluded that he died at the scene from multiple injuries which were described as 'non-survivable'.

Reaching her conclusion, coroner Fiona Borrill said that the risk of death was 'almost inevitable' when Fogarty - who had a number of previous convictions and a history of drug addiction - got behind the wheel.

She said: 'Clearly the driver of the stolen car did owe a duty of care towards Sean as another road user and clearly that has been breached. 

'It was a reasonably foreseeable consequence that as a result of the manner of his driving that the risk of death was almost inevitable if he collided with another vehicle.

'This driver was driving the vehicle at speed for a very lengthy period of time while the police were trying to stop him. 

'The speeds recorded range from 140-160kmh which is excessive to say the least. More importantly it is clear from the toxicology results that this driver was under the influence of illicit substances - amphetamines and cannabis. That would have seriously impacted his driving.

'This must have been a tragic loss of a very special person who had a massive amount to give and so much more to achieve.'

Dr Barrett is survived by his siblings Kate, Jonathan and Zoe, his two nephews and his girlfriend Ruth.
