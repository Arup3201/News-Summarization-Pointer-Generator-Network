A 5-year-old boy died after a neighbor's pit bull attacked him on Sunday afternoon.

John Harvard was playing outside his family's Riverside, Alabama home when the dog attacked him, Mayor Rusty Jessup told MailOnline. The attack took place between 3 and 3:30pm.

Older brother Bradley, 9, was on his way home from a nearby friend's house to get John ready for supper at their grandmother's home - only to see the pit bull's attack.

Deadly attack: A pit bull, like the one seen here, tragically attacked 5-year-old John Harvard on Sunday afternoon

Grieving: Riverside Mayor Rusty Jessup, pictured, said the pit bull that attacked John Harvard used to play with him and his older brother Bradley

Bradley kicked and grabbed at the dog to try and protect his little brother before he ran to their father for help, Jessup said. The boys' father then shot at the dog, reportedly grazing its ears.

The pit bull belongs to the family's next-door neighbor and is 8 months old. The dog is believed to weigh between 80 and 100 pounds, Alabama.com reports.

A neighbor called 911 but realized John needed assistance immediately. He was taken to St. Vincent's St. Clair Hospital by his father and brother, where he was pronounced dead.

Probe: Investigators are seen here looking at the yard where the attack took place. The pit bull, which was not on a leash at the time, is currently being held at an animal shelter

Sadly, Jessup says the neighbor's dog used to play with the boys.

'It goes without saying what a tragedy it is [...] I was close with the boy and his family,' he said. '[The neighbor] is more saddened than anybody is. They feel responsible.'

The dog was not leashed at the time of the attack and there is no leash law in Riverside, though Jessup said now may be the time to reconsider. He said two city councilmen have already approached him about the matter.

'We have nuisance laws, we've talked [...] this has come up twice since I've been here,' Jessup said. He said residents have previously opposed the measure when it was brought up at city council meetings.

An autopsy is scheduled to be performed on the boy's body on Tuesday, ABC3340 reports. No charges have been filed.

The pit bull has been taken to a local animal clinic, the station adds. The District Attorney and the St. Clair Sheriff's Office are expected to determine next steps.
