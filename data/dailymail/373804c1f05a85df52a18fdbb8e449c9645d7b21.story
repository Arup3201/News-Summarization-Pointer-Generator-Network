Marouane Fellaini has revealed his ultimate five-a-side team - and there's even a spot for his old Everton pal Sylvain Distin alongside just one of his Manchester United team-mates.

The Belgium international, 27, is back to playing his best football having endured a difficult start to life at Old Trafford following his £27.5million arrival from Everton 18 months ago.

He has become a key figure in manager Louis van Gaal's plans, scoring four goals to help fourth-placed United maintain their quest for a return to the Champions League next season.

He impressed in United's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday and has now linked up with his international team-mates ahead of their forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Cyprus and Israel.

Fellaini, however, was unable to accommodate the likes of Belgian pals Eden Hazard, Vincent Kompany or Thibaut Courtois in his ultimate fives team.

He failed to find room for himself and the likes of Wayne Rooney, Angel di Maria and Robin van Persie too.

Yet he did manage to select one United colleague in his fearsome starting line-up.

'The keeper? I play with good keepers, it is hard to pick!' said Fellaini, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail as part of the launch for the first New Balance Football advert.

'But the keeper I choose... it has to be (David) De Gea. I need a defender too, so I will choose Sylvain Distin. 'He is my best mate and a great player as well. And then it has to be (Zinedine) Zidane, (Lionel) Messi, (Cristiano) Ronaldo.'

It is no surprise to see Lionel Messi (above) and Cristiano Ronaldo (below) in Fellaini's five-a-side dream team

Indeed a formidable five-a-side team and one the towering Belgian cannot fit himself into.

Although Hazard fails to make the cut, Fellaini believes the Chelsea star has been the best player in the Barclays Premier League this season.

Jose Mourinho's side have a six-point lead at the top of the table, with a game in hand and Fellaini expects his compatriots Courtois and Hazard will be toasting glory in May.

'At the moment, Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League,' said Fellaini. 'I think Chelsea will win the title.'
