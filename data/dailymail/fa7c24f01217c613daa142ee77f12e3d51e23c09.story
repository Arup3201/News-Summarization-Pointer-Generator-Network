She is one of the few women to survive Auschwitz, endured a brutal forced march and ended World War II in the hellish place that was Bergen-Belsen.

But, as the world marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, Kitty Hart-Moxon says she has forgiven the people who almost killed her - and holds no grudges against the Germans.

Hart-Moxon, now 88, says today's Germans shouldn't be held responsible for their forefather's crimes but worries that a repeat of the Nazi genocide could be repeated elsewhere.

Forgiveness: Auschwitz survivor Kitty Hart-Moxon, 88, says she bears no grudges towards the Germans

'I mix a lot with Germans now and I go to Germany all the time,' she explains. 'It’s a different generation,' said Hart-Moxon, speaking ahead of today's Holocaust Memorial Service, which will be screened on BBC2 this evening.

'Young Germans have got a guilt complex because they say, well they are, they are the children of the killers.

'But we always say, "Look it doesn't matter if you’re the child of a killer, you are not responsible - you were not the killer. 

'You have no guilt and you shouldn't be feel guilty because you didn't do anything. It was a personal choice and you cannot be responsible for what your parents did or your grandparents.'

Hart-Moxon, who now lives in Harpenden in Hertfordshire, was born in the Polish city of Lublin and was just 13 when war broke out.

After enduring unimaginable privations in Lublin Ghetto, the family attempted to escape to Russia in early 1941 but with the border closed, they were forced to travel back into Poland.

Concern: Hart-Moxon says there is no guarantee that the Holocaust will not be repeated in future

While being sheltered by a priest named Father Krasowski, the family were able to obtain false permits and Hart-Moxon and her mother joined a transport of Poles being taken into Germany to work for the I.G.Farben factory in Bitterfeld.

But a year after arriving, Hart-Moxon, her mother and 12 other Jews working at the factory were betrayed to the Gestapo and on the 2nd April 1943, she arrived at Auschwitz.

Unusually, both Hart-Moxon and her mother were selected to work, with both given jobs stripping the dead and sorting their possessions at Auschwitz II Birkenau - the death camp part of the Auschwitz complex.

'I just remember never ending columns of people going in [to the crematoria] and never coming out,' remembers Hart-Moxon.

'We had no contact with people that were going to gas chamber. They were behind electric fencing and although they were not far away, they were too far too to recognise so you couldn't communicate with anyone that was passing by.'

Hart-Moxon says even if they had been able to warn the columns of men, women and children of the fate in store for them, it wouldn't have made a huge amount of difference.

Liberation: Auschwitz was liberated by the advancing Red Army, 70 years ago today

'What were you going to tell them? Were you going to tell them they were now going to die? You wouldn’t have done them a favour telling them that would you? 

'It was much better people didn't know then if they did know they were going to die. So no. it was never, never even in my thought to have warned people of what was going to happen. 

'We couldn’t go and tell these people, "Now you are going to die" - that would have been a really cruel thing to have done and anyway, it was it was totally forbidden.'

Despite the hardships and the constant threat of death, Hart-Moxon, who at one point succumbed to typhus, survived - as did her mother.

But as the Red Army of Russia approached, the pair were 'evacuated' along with a group of 100 women and taken to a sub-camp of Gross Rosen in the town of Reichenbach, now Dzierżoniów in southern Poland, where they were put to work in the local Philips factory.

Not long after, with the Red Army still advancing, Hart-Moxon and her mother were marched out of the camp along with 10,000 others.

They were destined for a factory in Porta Westfalica in north-western Germany but the conditions on the march were so harsh, just 200 arrived.

But with the Allies approaching from the west, Hart-Moxon's stint at the camp proved to be short-lived and once again, she and the other women were evacuated.

Crammed into cattle cars, they eventually pulled up outside the notorious Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.

But rather than being taken inside, the women were left to starve.'We were led to the big siding outside Belsen  and then at that rail junction stood dozens of trains, all full of people inside. 

'Sealed - in cattle trucks - sealed in. you could hear some people crying and some you couldn’t hear anything at all.

'The train just stood at the siding and people were just left to die outside Belsen.'

Just as it seemed her luck might finally have run out, a group of German soldiers took pity on the suffocating Jews and agreed to take them to a camp at Salzwedel, a subsidiary of the Neuengamme concentration camp.

It was to prove the last stop before liberation for Hart-Moxon, who was freed along with 1,000 other women when the Americans arrived on the 29th April 1945.

Hart-Moxon and her mother had survived but only just. Her father, as she later discovered, had been murdered by the Gestapo, while her brother Robert had been killed in the fighting.

Final destination: For most of the people who arrived, Auschwitz Birkenau was their final destination

Selection: Hart-Moxon initially worked sorting the belongings of the people murdered in the gas chambers

Her grandmother, like 95,000 other Lublin Jews, had been murdered in the gas chambers of Bełżec.

Despite the horror of her experiences, Hart-Moxon, who recently revisited Auschwitz with a pair of teenage girls, says she will continue to speak out about what happened.

'[After the war], I vowed no matter what I was going to do in my life, I’ve got to make quite sure that people know what happened,' she says.

'It is a warning. We try and do this to protect future generations because we have no guarantee about what’s going to happen.

'Have we a guarantee that this cannot happen again? Who can give you this guarantee today? If you see what’s going on around the world, can you say, "Oh no it can never happen?"

'That is why I think it’s important for people to know what’s in store - to protect future generations at least.

'I believe it’s my duty to to say what I have witnessed.'

Among the six Nazi vernichtungslager (extermination camps), Auschwitz holds a unique place thanks to its dual role as a concentration and work camp, and because of the especially large number of people murdered there.

Although the majority of Jews from Hart-Moxon's native Lublin died at the Bełżec death camp, among them her grandmother, Auschwitz was the final destination for one in six of Europe's Jews as well as prisoners of war, gypsies and other groups deemed undesirable by the Nazis.

The original camp, Auschwitz I, was built in 1940 to house Polish and Soviet prisoners, and continued to do so throughout the Nazi period, although Jews were also held in the camp from the start. 

Auschwitz II-Birkenau was built in 1941 and was designated a vernichtungslager by SS leader, Heinrich Himmler, the same year.

One of the first death camps, gas chambers were pioneered at Auschwitz and replaced the unreliable gas van method, which saw small groups murdered using the carbon monoxide produced by the exhaust.

The technology paved the way for a further five large camps: Chelmno, Sobibor, Bełżec, Majdanek and Treblinka, as well as two smaller camps, Sajmište in what is now Serbia and Maly Trostinets in Belarus.

But of all the camps, none murdered as many as Auschwitz which, after mass transports of prisoners began in 1942, was able to ‘process’ 9,000 Jews a day at the peak of its operations.

Among those who died at Auschwitz II-Birkenau were 400,000 Hungarians, 300,000 Poles, 69,000 French, 25,000 Belgians, 7,500 Italians and six British Jews from the Channel Islands. 

Of the 1.3 million murdered at Birkenau, 200,000 were children.
