Commuters' love of expensive gadgets mean they are at risk of losing up to £4,000 of technology every day by carrying them around in their work bag.

The most popular item is the Blackberry, which nearly half of commuters take to work, followed by laptops and the iPhone 4 or 4S.

Newcomers the Kindle Fire HD, the iPad mini and the Google Nexus 7 are all close behind, with 15 per cent of commuters taking them to work.

The typical commuter bag now contains as many as six devices, which would come to a total of £4,100.

More than a quarter of British adults say they carry at least three top of the range items around with them every day.

However, according to more than 1,000 adults surveyed by esure home insurance, 28 per 
cent do not know if they are properly insured for them.

Commuters are also not too worried about getting their technology out in public either.

On average they spend 
an average of nearly six hours using their iPad or laptop a day and up to two hours on their phones, leaving them vulnerable to potential muggers. 

In the past year, seven per cent of British adults said they had a portable device stolen.

Londoners carry the most expensive portable technology, with an average up to the value of £866.

Across the country commuters are keen to keep up with all the latest developments they can buy, meaning that they now carry up to £289 worth more than two years ago.

With the launches of the eagerly 
anticipated iPhone 5S and the Amazon phone this year, the value of 
commuter bags will increase still further.
