Claims: Michael Adebolajo (pictured) is alleged to have been assaulted by five officers in Belmarsh Prison in July

Five prison officers accused of assaulting one of Lee Rigby's killers are today facing a new investigation - with colleagues threatening strike action if they become 'victims of a witch hunt'.

Michael Adebolajo was allegedly assaulted and his front teeth knocked out in Belmarsh prison, South East London last July.

At the time, five long-standing prison officers were suspended and a criminal investigation was launched by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

In December, the CPS said charges would not be brought against the officers.

However, a new investigation is to be launched tomorrow by the National Offender Management Service - which has the ability to dismiss the officers if the complaint is proved.

Today, the general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association said strike action was a real possibility.

He told The People:'If we believe they are victims of a witchhunt by the Prison Service, we will take strike action.

'These men have been put under enormous pressure for simply doing their jobs. It is astonishing that given the CPS decision not to prosecute, they have not had their suspension lifted.

'These officers should be welcomed back to work and given the right kind of support.

'Instead, they have been virtually forgotten about by the Prison Service and left to rot.

'Our members are extremely angry and frustrated by the action against these men and a national walkout is a very real threat.'

Investigation: Having been cleared of any criminal charges, the five officers of Belmarsh Prison (pictured) will now be investigated by the National Offender Management Service

A prison service spokesman said: 'Whilst the CPS have decided not to pursue a criminal prosecution against the five prison officers they remain suspended to enable an internal disciplinary investigation to take place.

'Given the serious nature of the allegations it is appropriate to investigate the matter under our own disciplinary arrangements.'

In July the killer's brother Jeremiah Adebolajo told the BBC: 'They decided to twist his arm back... the arm that had been shot... He manoeuvred out of that so they smashed his head against a window.'

Mr Adebolajo added: 'I wonder why it took five prison officers to restrain one man and how in the course of that restraint his teeth were able to be knocked out if they were following procedures.'

Death: Drummer Lee Rigby, 25,  suffered a brutal death at the hands of Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale last May

The Prison Officers' Association said at the time he was being restrained using approved techniques, and that its members strenuously deny any wrongdoing.

Support the Belmarsh Five, a campaign by the officer's colleagues, has gained 1,000 signatures.

Adebolajo, 29 and accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, were convicted at the end of last year of the brutal murder of soldier Lee Rigby, 25.

The pair attacked the man close to his barracks in Woolwich, south east London, in May 2012.
