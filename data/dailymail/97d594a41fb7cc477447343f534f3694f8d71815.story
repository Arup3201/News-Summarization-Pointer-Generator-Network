A talented student at a top New York high school has allegedly committed suicide out of shame for cheating on her German-language exam.

Omotayo Adeoye, 17, was allegedly caught peeking at her cellphone during a test at Harlem's High School for Math, Science and Engineering on Thursday afternoon.

The humiliated teen reportedly ran to the bathroom after being yelled at by her teacher, but never returned to her desk.

Witnesses said they saw the South Bronx resident hand her belongings to a stranger and jump into the Hudson River, forcing herself under water. She has not yet been found.

cheating on her exam on Thursday that she jumped into the Hudson River 
in New York and has not been found

New York Post reported the heartbreaking incident unfolded on Thursday afternoon when Adeoye's teacher Eva Malikova saw her cheating and snatched her phone away.

A male classmate told The Post that Malikova began screaming at Adeoye, 'Oh, you shouldn’t be cheating! You guys shouldn’t be cheating! You guys are lying to yourselves!'

When Adeoye burst into tears and apologized, Malikova reportedly snapped back: 'Oh, you are not really sorry. That’s not a sincere apology!'

The Post reported that law enforcement sources confirmed the harsh exchange.

Before asking to go to the bathroom, the promising senior scrawled a heart wrenching note on her exam: 'I just want to go away forever on the bottom of the river'.

The humiliated teen then walked to the Hudson River’s edge at West 165th Street, put her ID down on the river bank and jumped into the water.

Witnesses told The Post that it appeared the girl - who can't swim - forced herself down.

New York Daily News reported that witnesses pleaded with the girl to return to shore.

Her school called authorities about 30 minutes to an hour after she disappeared.

Emergency crews have scoured the river, but have found no sign of the biology whiz.

Adeoye’s mother was too devastated to talk to New York Daily News on Friday night.

'She was a good girl, but I can’t talk about it,' she said.

Malikova has not commented publicly.

A Department of Education spokeswoman told The Post the department would do more to address mental health issues with students.

'We are conducting an investigation into this tragic incident, and we are taking immediate action,' she said.

Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña offered her condolences.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and her school community,' she said  'This must be a call to action.'
