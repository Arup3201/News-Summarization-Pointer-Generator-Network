He had gone to the recycling plant to do the environmentally responsible thing, help a friend out, and maybe get a little cash in return for his efforts.

But Ben Forrer would soon rue the moment he pitched up at the depot with an old cooker in the back of his van.

The 33-year-old fireman unloaded the unwanted oven before going to talk to the manager in his office.

Mistakenly crushed: Ben Forrer's van was crushed by mechanical scrapyard equipment accidentally while he dumped an old oven at the scrapyard

He had been there for just three minutes when he came out to find his £5,000 Citroen Relay van was not where he had parked it.

‘I checked my pockets in case I’d left
the keys in and someone had moved it,’ he said. ‘I carried on walking 
around the yard and became more and more panicky.’

Unlucky owner: 33-year-old fireman Ben Forrer watched in horror as his vehicle was crushed

And then, puzzlement turned to horror.

He looked up and saw his 12-year-old vehicle dangling from a crane above a huge crushing machine.

Mr Forrer, from Swinford, Leicestershire, said: ‘I could see my van just swinging from side to side.

‘Obviously I was more than a little bit taken aback so I just started shouting “stop!” and running through the yard.’

Staff – who had mistaken the van for scrap – immediately lowered it to the ground, but it was already a write-off.

‘The roof was crushed in and the windows smashed from the mechanical grabber’, Mr Forrer said. 

‘I was furious because even though it was a bit old it still had loads of life in it.

‘They said they thought it was a bit odd that the tax was in date, and the tyres were OK.’

Tools Mr Forrer had been keeping in 
the back and using for work on a farm conversion for himself and his 
wife Mandy, 32, were also damaged.

The accident happened at a site run by waste management company Sita, in Coventry, on Saturday.

The cooker’s owner, a friend of Mr 
Forrer, had asked him to take it to the plant as a favour. ‘The galling 
thing is that I only got a tenner for the cooker,’ Mr Forrer added.

‘I never thought I’d lose my van. It was parked in an area where there was no indication this might happen.

Insurance claim: Mr Forrer yelled 'no, no, stop' but it was too late. The truck was a write-off and he is going to claim £5,000 from scrapyard Sita UK

Mangled: Mr Forrer was disposing of an oven for a friend, but returned to find his van in the jaws of the crusher

‘It’s an absolute wreck.  The roof’s caved in and some of the panels are smashed, but it could have been a whole lot worse.

‘There could have been a dog or a child in a car seat in there.

‘The yard has already changed its 
procedures and started spray painting the word “scrap” on the side of 
cars that are supposed to be crushed.’

Mr Forrer has lodged a claim for 
£5,000 on the company’s insurance. A spokesman for Sita UK said: ‘Our 
insurance company is now working to resolve this matter as quickly as 
possible.’
