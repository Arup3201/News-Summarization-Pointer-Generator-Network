A New York City cab driver who struck and killed a 9-year-old boy crossing the street on the Upper West Side back in January has now been charged in connection to the accident.

Koffi Komlani, 53, was taken into custody October 7 on suspicion of failing to exercise due care when making a left turn from West 97th Street onto West End Avenue on the night of January 10, when he mowed down Cooper Stock, 9, and injured his 51-year-old father, Dr Richard Stock.

Komlani initially got off with a ticket for failure to yield to a pedestrian and police ruled the fatal crash an accident.

Justice for Cooper: New York City cabbie Koffi Komlani, 53, has been charged with failing to exercise due care, which resulted in the death of 9-year-old Cooper Stock in January 

Devastating: The boy's head and body were run over by the front and rear tires on the driver's side, while his father, Dr Richard Stock (right) suffered a leg injury 

At the time, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance stated that he could not charge the cabbie with vehicular homicide because of a law that requires two separate citations to show criminal conduct, reported Eyewitness News.

Komlani only had one citation for failure to yield. At the time of the crash, the cabbie had been driving on an expired TLC license for nearly six months.

The case sparked an outrage in New York and prompted Mayor Bill di Blasio to implement the Vision Zero program - a citywide initiative whose goal is to put an end to traffic deaths by creating 'slow zones.'

If convicted of failure to exercise due care, Komlani could face up to 15 days in jail and a fine of $750. He also stands to lose his driver's license. 

Got off easy: Komlani was initially cited for failure to yield to a pedestrian, and the January 10 crash was ruled an accident 

In violation: At the time of the crash, the cabbie had been driving on an expired TLC license for nearly six months

Following his arrest, Komlani was released on his own recognizance. His next court date is December 4.

Dana Lerner, Cooper's mother, was not satisfied with the charge against the man who killed her son.

‘He wasn’t speeding, he just didn’t stop. He hit two people and a child died. That’s not a traffic violation. That’s a crime,’ she told New York Daily News.

The accident happened when Cooper and his father were coming home from dinner on January 10 at about 8:30pm.

Koffi Komlani turned left from 97th Street onto West End Avenue, striking both as they crossed the avenue.

Cooper's head and body were run over by the front and rear tires on the driver's side. His father, Dr. Richard Stock, a radiation oncologist whose patient list includes former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, suffered a minor leg injury.

When interviewed by police, Komlani said he did not see the boy and his dad when he turned left on a green light.

Heartbroken: Cooper's mother, Dana Lerner, pictured with her husband on the day of their son's memorial service in January, helped push through a new law that strips taxi drivers of their license if they kill or injure a pedestrian 

'Suddenly I heard a boom,' Komlani told police, according to a criminal complaint cited by New York Daily News. 'I never saw anyone. I accelerated to the left and stopped my car. When I got out of the car, someone said to me, "You just killed a kid."'

During an emotional memorial service for Cooper attended by hundreds of family members, friends and well-wishers, the precocious 9-year-old was remembered for his sense of humor, wit and his love for the New York Knicks, DNAInfo.com reported at the time.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, Dana Lerner helped push through a legislation named after her son, intended to suspend taxi drivers' TLC licenses automatically if they kill or injure a pedestrian as a result of failure to yield.

The City Council adopted Cooper's Law, sponsored by Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, in May.
