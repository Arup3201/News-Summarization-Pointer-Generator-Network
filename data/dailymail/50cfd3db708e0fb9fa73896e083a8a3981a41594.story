The Turkish immigrant who 'invented' the doner kebab at his market stall in West Berlin has died at the age of 80.

Kadir Nurman, widely credited as inventor of the popular fast food meal, passed away in Berlin.

He set up the stall at a train station in 1972 - selling grilled meat and mixed salad inside a flatbread.

He later claimed to have noticed the increasingly fast pace of city life - believing busy Berliners might like a meal they could eat on the go.

The doner kebab, which features juicy meat sliced from a rotating skewer - with all the trimmings and optional chilli or garlic sauce - has since become one of Britain's most reviled food creations.

It is now a firm fast food favourite across the world - particularly with late-night revellers and students.

Its success even prompted the launch of a doner kebab-flavoured Pot Noodle in 2009.

While there have been many other possible 'inventors' of the kebab, Mr Nurman's contribution was recognised by the Association of Turkish Doner Manufacturers in 2011, according to the BBC.

The entrepreneur was born in Istanbul, Turkey, before emigrating to Germany in 1960 at the age of 26.

As he did not patent his invention, he was not able to profit from the doner kebab's subsequent success.

However, in a 2011 interview with German magazine Frankfurter Rundschau, Mr Nurman said he was happy that millions of people across the world ate the fast food meal.Â 

He added that the kebab's success meant that thousands of Turkish people could make a living selling it.

There are now more than 15,000 doner kebab outlets in Germany - including at least 1,000 in Berlin alone.

In Scotland, the kebabs are popular with both late-night drinkers and people looking for a cheap and different meal out - with the doner meat often coated in batter and deep fried.

However, despite the popularity of the fast food snack, a study has revealed that it contains 'sky-high' levels of salt, fat and calories.

A particularly large and greasy specimen can contain up to 2,000 calories - as many as a woman should eat in a whole day.

The average kebab also provides 98 per cent of the daily salt quota and 148 per cent of the daily saturated fat limit for an adult, according to the study, carried out in the UK in 2009.

And one in three doner kebabs include meat from several different species of animal - including sheep, cows, chickens and pigs.
