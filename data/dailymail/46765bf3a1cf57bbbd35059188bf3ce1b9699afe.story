A serial fraudster managed to con prison guards into letting him walk free from jail by sending them emails from the ‘courts service’ demanding his release.

Neil Moore, 28, set up a fake website and sent emails purporting to be from the courts service to trick Wandsworth Prison into thinking he had been freed on bail by a judge.

However, the ‘consummate and practiced’ conman appeared to have a ‘change of heart’ just three days after his release and was re-arrested after informing his solicitor of his actions.

Moore, of Ilford, north east London, had originally been jailed for an elaborate web of frauds which saw him posing as bank staff to dupe major organisations into handing over more than £1million.

He pretended to be employed by RBS, Lloyds bank, and Bank of America to dupe companies into handing over money.

Cambia Autos was conned out of £46,000 in November 2013, Thomas Global Exchange handed over £140,000 to Moore, TD Banking gave up $120,751, and Hogan and Vest was duped out of $739,439 in 2012 and 2013.

Moore also targeted Volkswagen by posing as an employee of the Bank of New York in December 2013.

Ian Paton, prosecuting, described Moore as a ‘consummate and practiced’ fraudster.

‘He [Moore] acquired bail forms that he adapted for his purposes,’ he said.

Moore's transgender wife, Kristen Angel, 27, was at Southwark Crown Court today to support her partner

Moore had carried out the cons over the phone, leading investigators to suspect his transgender wife, Kristen Angel Moore, 27, of being involved as well, but the fraud charges against her were dropped.

The couple are in a civil partnership but Mrs Moore has been unable to visit her partner in prison because of her transgender status.

Moore admitted five counts of fraud at Southwark Crown Court today and planned to deny a further charge of unlawful escape and have it thrown out.

However, when the prosecution said his case was almost ‘unanswerable’ Moore decided to change his plea on the latter charge to guilty.

Judge John Price had said of Moore’s anxiety to press on with the case: ‘He can have his argument [dismissal of the count], but the defendant knows what he did or didn’t do.’

Moore had been in custody  since January 21 last year and devised the escape plan from his cell.

He successfully designed a fake website and sent emails purporting to be from the court service alleging he was legible for bail.

On March 10, he collected his belongings and simply walked out of Wandsworth where murderers and rapists are held.

At today's hearing, Judge Price ordered reports before sentencing Moore and said: ‘It is obviously going to be prison, but it’s important to know more about you.’

Afterwards, Met Police detective inspector Chris Soole said: ‘This is a very intelligent fraudster.

‘He was very apt at committing a number of different frauds across the globe.

‘This shows the Metropolitan Police’s commitment to investigating fraud and ensuring justice for the victims.’
