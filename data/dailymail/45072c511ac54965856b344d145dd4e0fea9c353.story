Amazon has now been revealed to sell Holocaust denial and white supremacist literature.

The online retailer has been shown to sell books denying the holocaust and promoting anti-Semitism and the superiority of the white race with titles such as The Myth of the Extermination of the Jews and Building a Whiter and Brighter World.

The books and ebooks are on sale even in countries that ban such texts, according to an investigation by The Kernel – which first uncovered the hateful Holocaust denial screeds.

Shameful: It has now been revealed that online retailer Amazon sells Holocaust denial books

Despite reportedly removing the volumes of violent and horrifying sex-related works disclosed last week from its digital stacks, the online retailer still has a long way to go before cleansing itself of other vile titles.

Some of the Holocaust denial books are even on sale in Austria, France and Germany, according to The Kernel, countries whose laws ban such literature.

The texts are also illegal in Liechtenstein, where Amazon maintains a European headquarters to reduce tax burden, The Kernel noted.

Unlike the rape, bestiality and incest titles disclosed last week, many of these books can be found by searching for them.

Shoppers unable to track down their favorite racist titles can also find them in the trusty 'customers who bought this item also bought' product carousel.

The racist diatribes were first removed from the online retailer’s virtual shelves in 2009 after the Amazon Germany was sued by the American Jewish Committee for stocking at least 50 Holocaust denial books, according to The Kernel – but the tide of discrimination appears to have come back in.

Among the Holocaust denial books is Did Six Million Really Die? The preview questions the validity of claims of gas chambers and alleges many survivor stories have been made up.

‘The Auschwitz Camp Museum has confessed that the "gas chamber" shown to tourists is fake,’ the preview says. Later adding that ‘eyewitness survivor’ memoirs, including that of Simon Wiesenthal have been forged.’

The preview ends saying ‘the story was made up.’

There is also a series of books titled ‘Holocaust Handbook Series,' which prominently feature the Nazi symbol, atop the Star of David on the cover of every volume.

Ebooks with titles such as Dissecting the Holocaust: The Growing Critique of Truth and Memory, The Myth of the Extermination of the Jews and The Hoax of the Twentieth Century: The Case Against the Presumed Extermination of European Jewry populate the collection.

‘It reads as exciting as a crime novel,’ the preview for the first title mentioned above says. ‘This is the intellectual adventure of the 21st century.’

The First Holocaust: Jewish Fund Raising Campaigns with Holocaust Claims During and After World War I, is another title in the ‘Holocaust Handbook’ series found in a separate MailOnline investigation.

Other Holocaust denial titles include Auschwitz: The First Gassing. Rumor and Reality and Confessions of a Holocaust Revisionist.

The sole purpose of 'Auschwitz' is to disprove the possibility that any Jewish people were ever gassed as the infamous concentration camp.

Among some of the more eye-opening anti-Semitic titles in the Amazon store are The Synagogue Of Satan - Updated, Expanded, And Uncensored  and Conspiracy of the Six-Pointed Star.

The Synagogue of Satan blames the Jewish people for the slave trade, among other accusations, according to The Kernel.

As before, many of these books are Kindle-only, but this time some of them, including ‘Conspiracy’ are also available in hard cover and paperback.

Two more: Despite its innocuous title, Expanding Creativity is as hateful as any book on the site

MailOnline’s own investigation also uncovered several white supremacist-promoting materials with the following titles.

Building a Whiter and Brighter World, The White Man’s Bible, and Expanding Creativity, which – despite its innocuous title – is actually the latest in a series of writing to which the two books named just before it belong.

The WMB’s description boasts that is banned in Canada and is ‘considered as most dangerous literature for modern liberal values.’

The description further states that some ‘areas of concern are extremely important to the survival, expansion and advancement of the White Race' are detailed in its pages.

Part of a series: These two books, along with Expanding Creativity promote an all-white religion with the goal of an all-white world population

Movies too: The anti-Semitism ranting extends even to movie reviews

The most bizarre of the white supremacist titles, though, is Trevor Lynch's White Nationalist Guide to the Movies.

‘Since 2001, Trevor Lynch’s witty, pugnacious, and profound film essays and reviews have developed a wide following among cinephiles and White Nationalists alike,’ the book’s description on Amazon reads.

‘He sees movies without the usual blinders,’ the description cheerfully proclaims. ‘He is quite aware that because Hollywood is controlled by Jews, one must typically analyze movies for their propaganda value.’

Mr Lynch’s review of summer blockbuster ‘Django Unchained’ calls it ‘another Jewish wet dream’ before saying that ‘hateful fantasies about teaming up with blacks to harm whites are staples of the Jewish imagination.

The movie reviews can be had on the Kindle, in soft cover or via hardcover book.

Multiple requests to Amazon for comment from both The Kernel and MailOnline seeking comment were not returned.
