The wealthiest man in France is to sue the country’s biggest Left-wing newspaper for running a front-page picture of him under the headline: ‘Get lost, you rich p***k!’

Liberation’s attack on Bernard Arnault, 63, worth around £32billion and also Europe’s richest man, came after his decision to seek Belgian nationality as President Francois Hollande prepares to introduce a 75 per cent tax rate for the super-wealthy.

Yesterday’s headline, with a picture of Mr Arnault smiling in front of an overnight travel bag, read: ‘Casse-toi riche con!’

Tax avoidance: Bernard Arnault has applied for Belgian nationality

News of his intention to quit France 
has prompted anger across the country, but Mr Arnault, whose LVMH 
luxury-goods group runs companies such as Dior, Dom Perignon and Louis 
Vuitton, insists his desire to become a Belgian has nothing to do with 
avoiding tax.

He claims he is moving for personal reasons and will continue paying taxes in France.

But few believe him, and Liberation was not alone in its attack.

Mr Hollande, who has openly admitted that he dislikes rich people, said Mr Arnaud 'should have reflected on what it means to ask for another nationality, because we are proud to be French'.

Benoit Hamon, Minister for the Social Economy, also suggested Mr Arnault was unpatriotic saying: 'I expect the French, especially the richest ones, to be true patriots.'

Leftist politician Jean-Luc Melenchon 
said the country did not need such ‘parasites’ and Socialist lawmaker 
Bruno Le Roux said Mr Arnault was ‘betraying France’s recovery’.

But Mr Arnault, who runs luxury goods giant LVMH – which includes designer brands like Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton – said Liberation had gone too far.

He is suing the paper for making 'public personal insults', with a statement reading: 'Bernard Arnault has no other choice, given the extreme vulgarity and brutality' of the headline in Liberation, which is the French equivalent of The Guardian.

President Francois Hollande (right) had prompted Mr Arnault to become a
Belgian

If found guilty Liberation will be 
expected to run a public apology, probably on its front page, although 
any fine will be nominal.

Politicians
from right and left are now accusing Mr Hollande of driving 
wealth-creating tycoons out of the country to cities like Brussels, 
London, and Geneva, where they will pay less tax.

Francois
Fillon, the conservative who stepped down as Prime Minister of France 
in May, said 'stupid decisions' by the Socialists who replaced his own 
government had prompted Mr Arnault to become a Belgian.

Mr
Fillon said: 'When you take stupid decisions, you get these terrible 
results. The chief of one of the best companies in the world, who 
symbolises French know-how and success, known throughout the world, has 
been prompted to change his nationality because of the fiscal policy 
which is being applied in our country.'

'If there's a certain brutality, or 
vulgarity in Liberation, it it precisely because of the situation in 
which we find ourselves.'

Despite the row, Mr Hollande insists there will be 'no exceptions' to his 75 per cent super tax, which with other contributions will see some giving up to 90 per cent of their salaries to the government.

Mr Hollande said that the tax was 'symbolic' and would 'set an example' to everybody else in society.

The Socialist President has made no secret of the fact that he sees taxing the rich as the key to revitalising France's stagnant economy.

Liberation used the front page headline as a play on words on a similar insult former conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy used in 2008.

Mr Sarkozy, a close personal friend of Mr Arnault, told a man who had been rude to him in a crowd in Paris: 'casse-toi, pauvre con'.

This means 'go away, poor p****', with the idea being that the Socialist were telling multi-billionaires like Mr Arnault 'go away, rich p****'.

In an editorial linked to their front page, Liberation made it clear that they were highlighting a nationwide debate about Mr Hollande apparently driving the rich out of France with his high taxes.

'It is primarily ironic humour, ' said deputy editor Sylvain Bourmeau. 'If there's a certain brutality, or vulgarity in Liberation, it it precisely because of the situation in which we find ourselves.

'The decision by Bernard Arnault' to see Belgian nationality 'also contains a certain dose of vulgarity, and there's been a boomerang effect.'

If Mr Arnaud wins his case he is likely to get no more than 1 euro in damages.

Liberation was founded by the world famous philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1973, and is viewed as the mouthpiece of liberal France. It sells around 140,000 copies a day, and is widely read online.
