The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry.

In this international week, we are begging for goals, and these lot put the ball in the back of the net and make it look easy.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through Nos 40-31 of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League... do you agree?  

40. Darren Bent (Ipswich Town, Charlton Athletic, Tottenham, Sunderland, Aston Villa, Fulham)

Powerful and prolific, Bent proved he had all the attributes needed to lead an attack at a number of Premier League clubs and, for a time, England too.

He proved himself with three free-scoring seasons in the second-tier with Ipswich and it was a matter of time before he was snapped up by a Premier League side. That team was Charlton and Bent proved his worth with goals in his first four games for the club and 31 overall.

Tottenham believed in his potential and splashed out a club record £16.5million in 2007 but he moved on to Sunderland after two seasons. Twenty-four goals in the 2009-10 season reaffirmed his class.

Bent then joined Villa for another big transfer fee though his best could never be recaptured. In all, he has 106 Premier League goals.

39. Eidur Gudjohnsen (Chelsea, Tottenham, Stoke City, Fulham)

The 'Ice Man' is fondly remembered by Chelsea fans for his goalscoring exploits in the years immediately before Roman Abramovich arrived.

Signed by Gianluca Vialli for £4m from Bolton in 2000, he soon formed a potent strike partnership with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink at Stamford Bridge. His first campaign saw him score 10 and set up many more for the Dutchman.

As well as 54 goals for Chelsea, Gudjohnsen also contributed 60 assists, underlining his all-round ability. His best was probably that overhead kick against Leeds United in 2002-2003. 

His worth was also shown by the fact Jose Mourinho continued to play him for some time ahead of expensive acquisitions Adrian Mutu, Didier Drogba and Hernan Crespo.

38. Niall Quinn (Manchester City, Sunderland)

Quinn was already an established First Divison player with Arsenal and Manchester City before enjoying his profitable time at Sunderland around the turn of the Millennium.

He was signed for a club record £1.3m in August 1996 and helped them return and then establish themselves in the top flight, forming a deadly strike partnership with Kevin Phillips.

Standing 6ft 4in tall, Quinn was the perfect target man and his many flick-ons and knock-downs helped Phillips profit. A true club legend, the Irishman also served as chairman and, briefly, manager.

37. Craig Bellamy (Coventry City, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers, Liverpool, West Ham, Manchester City, Cardiff City)

The Welsh goal-grabber forged a successful career in the Premier League and couldn’t be faulted on his record despite some controversial moments. He first shot to prominence at Norwich before Coventry acquired him for a club record fee of £6m in 2000, but it wasn’t the happiest period as they suffered relegation. 

Newcastle rescued his top-flight ambitions but his time in the North East was overshadowed by fallings-out and he scored just 28 goals in four seasons. His most successful spell was his one season at Blackburn with 13 league goals, the greatest moment arguably his double at Old Trafford for Man City in September 2009.

36. Emmanuel Adebayor (Arsenal, Manchester City, Tottenham)

Togolese tower Adebayor was brought to Arsenal from Ligue 1 for £3m in 2006 and proved his worth with the winning goal at Old Trafford and two strikes against Tottenham in the derby the following season. 

His stunning volleyed second in that game won Goal of the Season. He joined moneyed Machester City for £25m in 2009, running the full length of the field to celebrate in front of the Arsenal fans after scoring against them at the Etihad.

The arrivals of Carlos Tevez, Mario Balotelli and Edin Dzeko forced him out but profitable loan spells at Real Madrid and Tottenham led to his joining the north London club permanently. He has 35 league goals in total for Spurs.

35. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (Manchester United)

The master of the late sucker-punch, Norwegian import Solskjaer was the ultimate ‘super sub.’ While there were no goals more famous than his stoppage time winning for Manchester United in the 1999 Champions League final, he did contribute a total of 91 in the Premier League during his time at the club, many late on.

He famously netted four after coming on in an 8-1 thrashing of Nottingham Forest in 1999 and he returned 17 goals in 2001-02. Solskjaer suffered a torrid time with injuries during his later Old Trafford career but that outstretched leg in Barcelona, securing United’s unprecedented Treble triumph, ensured he will forever remain a club legend.

34. Duncan Ferguson (Everton, Newcastle United)

Towering and uncompromising Scot who could be almost impossible to keep track of in the box, ‘Big Dunc’ Ferguson was and remains a popular figure at Everton. He moved to Merseyside from Rangers in 1994 but it took a little time to find his best form. 

He enjoyed two excellent seasons between 1996 and 1998, earning affection from the Goodison Park faithful for his commitments and combative performances. Injuries ruined his chances after moving to Newcastle and he returned to Everton after just two seasons on Tyneside. 

He would play six more seasons and is the highest-scoring Scot in the Premier League.

33. Mark Hughes (Manchester United, Chelsea, Southampton, Everton, Blackburn Rovers)

One of the finest British strikers of the modern era, Hughes was well-established as a prolific scorer at Manchester United by the time the Premier League started in 1992. ‘Sparky’ helped United end their long title drought with 28 goals in the first two seasons of the new competition, both won by United. 

The Welshman scored a memorable goal in United’s 1994 FA Cup semi-final with Oldham and also netted in the final, a 4-0 win over Chelsea, the club he would unexpectedly join in 1995. Despite many believing his best days were behind him, Hughes formed an effective strike partnership with Gianfranco Zola, scoring 25 league goals for the London club and winning the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup-Winners’ Cup.

32. Jermain Defoe (West Ham, Tottenham, Portsmouth)

Speedy and nerveless in front of goal, Defoe reached 124 Premier League goals for his three clubs and also scored 19 in 55 appearances for England. His 2004 departure from West Ham, for whom he scored 18 times in the top-flight drew some criticism but he shrugged it off to perform very well in his initial five seasons with Tottenham following a £6m move. 

Though lots of his appearances came as a substitute, Defoe still managed 43 goals before spending two years at Portsmouth. Spurs wanted him back and paid considerably more than what they sold him for. The 2009-10 campaign featured many highlights, including an overhead kick against Manchester United and a five-goal haul in a 9-1 thrashing of Wigan. In all, he scored 47 Premier League goals during his second spell at White Hart Lane.

31. Dion Dublin (Manchester United, Coventry City, Aston Villa)

Dublin had made his name as a free-scoring striker for Cambridge United, prompting Manchester United to sign him right at the start of the Premier League era. But his opportunities were limited by injury and the excellence of Eric Cantona and a move to Coventry in 1994 proved the making of him. 

He scored 13 in his first season at Highfield Road, followed by 14, 14 and a career-high 18. This came in 1997-98, as Dublin shared the top scorer award with Michael Owen and Chris Sutton. 

Having failed to break into the England side, Dublin moved to Villa for £5.75m in 1998, scoring seven goals in his first three games. A broken neck, suffered in December 1999, set him back though Dublin did go on to represent Leicester, Celtic and Norwich.
