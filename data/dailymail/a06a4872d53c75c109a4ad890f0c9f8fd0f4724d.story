Former German SS officer Erich Priebke will be buried in 'a secret location'

The Nazi war criminal, whose body has lain in limbo since he died two weeks ago, has avoided ‘a Bin Laden-style burial’, after a deal to inter his corpse in a secret location was struck, his lawyer has claimed. 

The coffin of Erich Priebke has been parked at a military airport in Rome for days since violent protests disrupted his funeral.

His family and friends had refused entreaties to have him cremated and buried at sea like Osama bin Laden. 

Former SS captain Priebke was serving a life sentence for the 1944 massacre of the Ardeatine Caves.

The slaughter outside Rome of 335 men and boys was a reprisal for an attack on Nazi police by resistance fighters.

It is considered the worst atrocity of the Second World War in Italy. 

Since Priebke’s death, an intense legal battle has raged over his burial place.

It is feared that any grave could become a pilgrimage site for his neo-Nazi followers. 

The Vatican banned any rites for taking place in Rome and the Prefect of Rome forbade his burial anywhere in the province. 

His birth town of Henningsdorf in Germany said they could not accommodate him, and even Argentina, his adopted homeland refused to take back his body, saying it ‘would be an affront to humanity’.

But a solution has now been found, according to Priebke’s lawyer. In a cryptic statement to Italian news agency ANSA, Paolo Giachini said: 'Everything is solved.'

Claiming victory ‘after a week of oppression’ he said:  'An agreement has been reached with the authorities for the burial of Erich Priebke in a secret place, between Germany and Italy, or in one of the two nations.’

He continued: 'The Jewish community wanted him to end up like Bin Laden, with the ashes scattered at sea, so as not to create a place of pilgrimage.

‘Instead we will be able to pay tribute to a figure who became symbol of dignity, freedom and human endurance.'

Neither the authorities nor the Jewish community have succeeded in defeating us, he said. 

'The Priebke family has got what it deserved, the rights to religious practice and burial that are guaranteed,'

Even in death Priebke has continued to cause pain to the relatives of his victims.

In a tape released posthumously but recorded before he died, Priebke showed no remorse, instead blamed the resistance fighters, for provoking the attack.

The partisans were fully aware of the consequences, he said. 'The commander when he arrived in Rome had put on the wall warnings that any attack against Germans would meet with a reprisal.

'They knew that and they did it anyway.’ 

It would have been unthinkable to refuse the direct order from the Fuhrer, Priebke claimed.

Priebke was serving a life sentence under house arrest for his role in the murder of 335 men and boys in the 1944 massacre of the Ardeatine Caves

‘Naturally it was impossible to refuse.

'Schultz said it was an order from Hitler and we had to carry it out.

He said if anyone didn’t want to do it they may as well line up with those who were to be executed.

'There was no other way.’

Priebke started his career as a teenage waiter working all over Europe including the Italian Riviera and a happy stint between 1933 and 1935 at the Savoy in London.

He later told friends of the exhilaration of watching the Silver Jubilee celebrations for George V.

He joined the Gestapo as a translator where he was swiftly promoted and posted to Rome.

At the end of the war he was captured by Allied troops but escaped from a British POW camp on New Year’s Eve 1947.

The Gestapo officer fled to Argentina where he ran a delicatessen and lived openly until tracked down and interviewed by an American journalist.

In 1995 he was deported to Italy and given a life sentence.

Because of his age he was allowed to serve his time under house arrest at the home of his lawyer.
