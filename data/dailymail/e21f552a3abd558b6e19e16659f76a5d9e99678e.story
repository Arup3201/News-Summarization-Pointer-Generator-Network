Peter Benstead, 72, is charged with orchestrating a £19.5million Ponzi scheme before using the cash to buy luxury homes and cruises for his family

A family who helped run a £19.5million Ponzi scheme which left 12,500 people out of pocket spent the money on luxury foreign homes and round the world cruises, a court has heard.

Peter Benstead, 72, his wife Susan, 69, son Julian, 46, and son-in-law Roderick Schmidt, 45, all appeared at Southwark Crown Court today charged with fraud and theft offences.

The jury heard that they persuaded innocent victims to had over huge sums of cash, including a retired Marine who lost his life savings of £210,000, before frittering it away on lavish items.

Peter Benstead bought a luxury house with a pool in the Dordogne region of France, another home in Cornwall, and spent £36,000 sending his wife on a 49-day cruise, the prosecution said.

Son Julian also bought 20kg of gold on behalf of one company with a promise to deliver it to clients, but only turned over half, the court was told.

The other 11kg was never seen again, and the jury were told that the father and son stole it.

The relatives are in the dock alongside Edward James, 75, the former Mayor of Glastonbury and company director, and accountant Stephen Matthews, 51.

The alleged fraud, which stretches back to 2006, centres on three companies, all of which were controlled by Peter Benstead.

Two of those, Crown Currency Exchange and Crown Holdings Ltd, were both foreign exchange companies, offering customers the chance to pre-order foreign currency up to a year in advance. 

The companies are alleged to have lured in investors by promising 'exchange rates that could never make a profit', the court heard.

The jury was told that both firms were 'hopelessly insolvent' for two years before finally collapsing in October 2010, and were kept afloat by luring in new investors to pay off existing customers.

The third, a goldbroker's called Mayfair and Grant, told customers it was using their money to buy precious metals which were stored at its secure headquarter.

In fact this money was being used for nothing more than to prop up the other two companies, the court was told. 

Prosecutor Peter Grieves-Smith said the Crown businesses and its goldbroker arm Mayfair and Grant were all interlinked and out to 'make a quick buck'.

Mr Grieves-Smith said: 'They (defendants) were robbing Peter, the new customer, to pay Paul, the old customers.

'It led to Crown going into greater and greater debt without any prospect of getting out.'

One victim of the alleged Ponzi scheme was an ex-Royal Marine who had moved into the transport industry after serving his country.

Mr Grieves-Smith added: 'Eventually he got to retirement age and in 2011 he sold his lorries, sold his home in Essex and had the idea of buying a property in Ireland.

'By September 2010 he had found somewhere suitable to buy and had a deposit down and then looked to find a foreign exchange company who he could trust for the £210,000 to Ireland.

'He found various good reviews, he did checks with Companies House and checks with the FSA.

'Reassured by what he had read, he placed an order with them on 20 September 2010 for £210,000 in Euros.

'He was to collect them in effect in Ireland on the 2 November, so he transferred his money to the company and waited for that moment.'

But Crown had gone into administration and all his money was lost with no protection from the FSA, the court heard.

'He ended up penniless, homeless and relying on the charity of others,' said Mr Grieves-Smith.

In the case of Mayfair and Grant, run by Benstead's son Julian, customers believed they were investing in bars of gold - some as small as 20g.

The customers were told these were being stored on the company's premises when, in fact, the firm had not bought anything with their money, the prosecutor said.

It was only when the banks began asking questions about the companies' activities that the ruse began to unravel, the court heard.

One Mayfair and Grant customer paid £83,000 for 4kg (8.8lb) of gold, it was said.

The customer was told his investment would be kept in a company safe for one year but this was not the case.

Instead, Benstead's son Julian made a trip to his suppliers in Birmingham to buy 20kg (44lb) of gold a week before the Crown businesses went into administration in October 2010.

Some was delivered to customers but the rest - 11kg (24lb) - went missing, the court heard.

Mr Grieves-Smith alleged that Julian and Peter Benstead decided to steal it, adding that the gold has not been seen since.

He added: 'The Crown companies were run in such a way that they could never make a profit and they knew it.

Edward James, 75 (left), the former Mayor of Glastonbury, was a director of the companies at the heart of the alleged fraud, while Julian Benstead, 46 (right), ran a firm involved in buying and selling gold

'They could only keep going by having a larger and larger turnover, by offering more attractive exchange rates.

'The reality was the companies were going into administration. To hide that, false accounts had to be provided.'

He said Peter Benstead's wife Susan was not involved in running the businesses, but she must have known about how her husband got the money for their new home.

He said: 'She is an astute businesswoman, she was not simply sitting on the sidelines, ignorant.'

The court heard that Peter Benstead also invented his own reality television show as part of his schemes to earn people's money back. 

The court was shown a brochure for Dream Island, Benstead's television company, which advertised public auditions for a new reality show on a luxury Caribbean island.

Wannabes were told they would be 'treated like a celebrity' with a top prize of £100,000.

Those interested in auditioning were told to pay £30, and Benstead had hoped to make more money by selling the concept to a larger television company.

Mr Grieves-Smith said: 'Not surprisingly, people saw through this pretty quickly. The idea died a death and the fees people paid were returned to them.'

He said the idea cost Peter Benstead £60,000, although the money actually came from Crown funds, the court heard.

The prosecutor said Crown staff were also encouraged to gamble with customer money. But they were 'lacking in experience and knowledge', and lost the cash, Mr Grieves-Smith said.

Julian Benstead (left) used clients' money to buy 20kg of gold just before his business went bankrupt, but only half was ever handed over, it was claimed. He was accused of helping to steal the other 11kg

James stood down as Tory chairman of Mendip District Council in the wake of the allegations.

Peter Benstead, from Penzance, Cornwall, denies three counts of fraudulent trading, two counts of false accounting, four counts of theft and one count of converting criminal property.

Susan Benstead, of the same address, denies a single count of converting criminal property.

Julian Benstead, of  Ludgvan, Penzance, denies one charge of fraudulent trading and a further charge of theft.

Schmidt, of Goldsithey, Penzance, denies two counts of fraudulent trading, three charges of false accounting and an additional charge of theft.

James, of  Glastonbury, Somerset; and Matthews, of  The Strand, Newlyn, Penzance, both deny two counts of false accounting and two counts of fraudulent trading.

The Southwark Crown Court trial, which is expected to last until May, continues.

 

Crown Currency Exchange and Crown Holdings Ltd 

Southwark Crown Court heard that both of these companies effectively operated as one, offering clients the ability to buy currency up to a year in advance at low exchange rates.

The businesses are alleged to have operated as a Ponzi scheme - constantly attracting new waves of investors to pay off the previous customers, while the owners skim money for themselves off the top.

One victim, a former Royal Marine, handed £210,000 to the company to buy Euros which would be used to purchase a home in Ireland for his retirement.

In fact he never saw a penny back, and is now homeless and living via the charity of others, the court was told. 

 Mayfair and Grant

Customers were told they were investing in gold bars, some as small as 20g, which were being held by the company at its secure headquarters.

In fact, nothing was being bought with their money, and the cash was instead used to prop up the other failing business, the jury heard.

Weeks before the company fell into insolvency, Julian Benstead is alleged to have used funds to buy 20kg of gold to hand over to investors.

According to prosecutors, only half of this ever materialised, the other 11kg was never seen again.

Southwark Crown Court was told that this gold was stolen by Julian Benstead and his father to help fund their lavish lives of foreign homes and luxury cruises.
