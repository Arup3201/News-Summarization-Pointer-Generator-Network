The Brazilian family of  pregnant woman Fabiana Palhares, 35, allegedly murdered with a tomahawk by her partner is trying to raise money to fly to Australia to deal with the tragedy

Ms Palhares' family members - who reside in Brazil - are trying to raise $50,000 and are considering bring her body home

'Fabiana had the biggest heart you could even imagine, and she would be the first to put her hand up to help someone,' the fundraising page reads.

'Fabiana's family need help to be able to come over to Australia and to pay for the expenses this tragedy has left.'

Ms Palhares' friend Lu Flores said her family is 'pretty lost' and her mother in 'shock'. Ms Flores said she was not sure if Ms Palhares' father knew yet, because he was recovering from heart surgery.

The family is considering taking her body back to Brazil to be cremated or buried there.

'Bringing the body is expensive, but if they decide to bury her in Australia then the family would go to Australia, either both ideas are expensive,' Ms Flores told Daily Mail Australia.

If they raise enough money Ms Palhares' brother and another family member would fly to Australia to organise her affairs.

Ms Palhares had lived in Australia for 11 years, ran her own cleaning business and owned a dog.

'This money its not just to pay for tickets flight... Fabiana had her whole life here, a car that probably was still being paid, she got a business with lots of contracts,' Ms Flores said.

Ms Palhares' family also needs to organise her affairs and debts. She had lived in Australia for 11 years, ran her own cleaning business and had a dog

'Also $1 [Australian] dollar means about $2.70 [Brazilian real].

'I reckon the biggest expense will be to bring her body or her ashes in case of cremation.

'If the family decides to bring her personal stuffs a ship container can cost nearly $10,000.'

Ms Plahares uncle Leo Palhares spoke to Daily Mail Australia from Brazil on behalf of her family.

'We can not believe our darling girl is gone, leaving such a void in our hearts,' said Mr Palhares.

'Our Fabiana was such a special person, a person of great light.' 

'It is almost impossible to speak about it.'

'She was dearly loved by us and will be so greatly missed.'

'We feel nostalgic thinking about her infectious smile, she gave us so much joy.'

Police have charged her partner Wall with her murder, the murder of an unborn child and unlawful assault of a pregnant woman. 

The case was mentioned at Southport Magistrates Court on Tuesday but Wall did not appear and no bail application was made. 

A man - understood to be her partner - was located in a car reportedly covered in blood, around the corner from the house and has been arrested

The woman was believed to be 10 weeks pregnant and according to neighbours she was a 'beautiful' person

A committal hearing for Wall's case will be heard in May.  

She was found in her home in Randwick Court, Varsity Lakes on Monday afternoon after the domestic incident.

It is believed that the police had been called to the house three weeks ago and according to a neighbour the couple had a history of domestic disputes.

Wall was located in a car reportedly covered in blood, around the corner from the house and has been charged with murder. 

He was put in a forensic evidence suit before being taken from the scene by police.

Another neighbour told the publication that she was a 'beautiful' person who had recently moved to the area. 

'She was such a small Brazilian lady and I had never seen them argue so it is a massive shock.'
