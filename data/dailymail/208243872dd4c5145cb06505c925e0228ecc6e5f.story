The city of Chicago agreed today to pay a record $22.5 million to a woman who was released from police custody in
 2006 and instead of being taken to a hospital for a psychiatric 
evaluation, she was released into a high crime area where she was gang 
raped and plummeted seven stories.

Christina Eilman, was 21-years-old when the crime occurred and she suffered permanent brain damage from the fall and has needed constant medical care ever since.

Eilman, who is bipolar, was taken into police custody at Midway Airport after suffering a 
mental breakdown on her flight from California.

Trauma: Here's Christina Eilman shortly after she was raped and plummeted from a seventh story window. She was released by cops instead of being taken to a mental hospital for an evaluation. The city of Chicago agreed today to give her $22.5 million

Rather than bring Eilman to a hospital, 
police released her after 29 hours in custody, despite her parents calling at least nine times to 
warn them about her mental health status and that she was having an episode.

Police later testified at a deposition hearing that she was visibly agitated and should have been taken to the hospital. Witnesses said she was throwing herself against the bars in her jail cell.

Eilman, a former UCLA student, was released near a housing project in a crime-ridden neighborhood on the city's notorious South Side when she encountered the sex fiends who attacked her.

She was dressed in just short shorts, a cutoff top and boots and was without her cellphone.

After being gang raped at knifepoint, she either fell or was pushed from a seven-story window, she suffered severe brain trauma and the 27-year-old will not recover.

'I’m embarrassed to think that a poor girl like this would have been so 
callously treated by members of the Chicago Police Department,' Alderman Edward Burke said, according to CBS/Chicago.

Her family had been seeking as much as $100 million in damages for pain and suffering and to cover Eilman's never-ending medical bills.

Gang member Marvin Powell was convicted of abducting Eilman but not sexually assaulting her or causing
 her to go out the window.

He served part of a 12-year sentence before 
being paroled last spring.

Eilman's settlement was one of two major payouts by the Illinois city today.

Alton Logan will receive $10.25 million for spending 26 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit.

Christina Eilman received $22.5 million.She was taken into police custody in 2006 after suffering a bipolar episode.Instead of being taken for a psychiatric evaluation, police kept her overnight and then released her into a high-crime area.She was then gang raped and plummeted from a seventh story window. Eilman, now 27, suffered permanent brain damage.Alton Logan received $10.25 million forIn 1982, Logan was arrested for shooting a security guard during a robbery. He was later convicted despite there being no physical evidence against him.He was later charged in a lawsuit that police knew another man possessed the dead security guard's weapon but kept that information quiet,keeping Logan behind bars.

Logan was arrested in 1982 for shooting Lloyd Wickliffe, an off-duty Cook County corrections officer 
who was working as a security guard, during a robbery attempt at a McDonald’s restaurant. 

Despite no physical evidence linking him to the crime, Logan was convicted.

He later alleged a cover-up engineered by police Commander Jon Burge.

Burge was later sent to federal prison for lying about abusing and torturing suspects.

Logan was freed in April 2008 after lawyers for Andrew Wilson — a convicted cop killer  — revealed that he had admitted 
to killing Wickliffe.

The attorneys didn't come forward until Wilson died in prison in 2007 because of their oath of confidentiality.

Logan alleged that
 cops who arrested Wilson knew he had Wickliffe's .38-caliber gun that 
was stolen off him after he was murdered.

The two settlements came after the city's alderman agreed at a vote this afternoon.

“As I sit here today, I’m both embarrassed and ashamed,” said Finance Committee Chairman Edward M. Burke, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

'It is time to put 
this behind us — and we are trying diligently to put these cases behind 
us,' city lawyer Stephen Patton said today.

'But, we have to be very dilligent for the next type of misconduct, for 
the next type of practice that could lead to exposure.

'We are trying
 to be on the top of the next [type of misconduct] And hopefully, 
nothing will be as egregious as Burge,' Patton said at the alderman hearing.

Innocent: Alton Logan spent more than a quarter century behind bars for a murder he didn't commit.

Coverup: Former Chicago police commander Jon Burge is serving four and a half years in federal prison for lying about torturing suspects.
