Marouane Fellaini has denied spitting at Pablo Zabaleta in the Manchester derby but the FA are investigating the incident.

The Manchester United midfielder was fortunate to only receive a yellow card for thrusting his forearm into Zabaleta’s face but new footage appears to show Fellaini spitting at the City defender on the ground. 

The FA have asked to see clearer images. United boss David Moyes said: ‘Marouane is adamant that he didn’t do that. We’ll work with the FA if that’s what we have to do to clear it.’

Footage: Video has emerged that appears to show Marouane Fellaini spit towards Pablo Zabaleta

Aftermath: The incident happened moments after Fellaini elbowed the Argentine defender

Insult to injury: Zabaleta was on the ground hurt

Walking away: Fellaini then walks away after being booked by Michael Oliver

Getting away with it: Fellaini was only booked for elbowing the City defender

Accident? Fellaini has since claimed that Zabaleta ran into his elbow

Banned: Hull City's George Boyd was retrospectively banned after spitting at City goalkeeper Joe Hart

The United midfielder was booked by 
referee Michael Oliver for a first-half elbow in the face of his City 
opponent. However, with Zabaleta stricken on the turf, Fellaini appears 
to spit at the Argentine immediately after being shown the yellow card.

The £28million summer signing was unrepentant about the elbow on the defender.

'I don't know, but I certainly didn't do it on purpose,' said Fellaini when asked about the incident that saw him pick up a just yellow card.

'I put my arm up to try and protect possession of the ball, and Zabaleta bounced (his jaw) against it. He was unlucky to make contact.

'The movement by me was not in an aggressive manner. It was a defensive move to protect the ball.'

Making a case: Michael Oliver opted to show Fellaini the yellow card rather than the red

Too easy: City barely moved out of second gear as they smashed United 3-0 at Old Trafford

Game, set and match: Edin Dzeko bags his second goal of the night in a dismal showing for United

The FA could now look into the incident 
in much the same way as they did when retrospective punishment was 
served on Hull City's George Boyd earlier this month.

Television cameras caught the forward spitting towards goalkeeper Joe Hart during Manchester City's 2-0 win at the KC Stadium.

Boyd was subsequently banned for three matches despite appealing against the charge and protesting his innocence.
