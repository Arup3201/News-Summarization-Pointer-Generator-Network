Lille want to keep Manchester City attacking midfielder Marcos Lopes on loan for another season.

The 19-year-old Portuguese joined Lille in August and has scored three goals in 16 appearances, including the winner in their 2-1 triumph over Lyon last weekend.

The youngster is rated at City but is out of contract in 2016, and they will look to extend his deal in the summer before discussing another season away from the Etihad.

Lopes has stood out at Lille, even with the French club sitting just ninth in Ligue 1.

It is understood Lille has begun talks with the Barclays Premier League champions over possibly keeping him for an additional year.

Portugal Under-21 international Lopes joined City from Benfica as a youth player in 2011 but has yet to feature for the senior squad in the league.

He scored after just two minutes on his professional debut in the FA Cup against Watford during a 3-0 win in 2013 to make him the youngest ever goalscorer for the  first team in a competitive match at the age of 17 years and nine days.
