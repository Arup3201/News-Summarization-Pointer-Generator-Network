A toilet block in an exclusive commuter town has sold for nearly half a million pounds - despite having no planning permission for redevelopment.

The former washroom in the Surrey town of Walton-on-Thames fetched £415,000 at auction, more than four times its £100,000 estimate.

A spokesman for the auctioneers said the  block had 'great potential' for redevelopment - as long as its new owner can obtain the correct planning permission.

The single story block is located on a 0.06 acre plot in the conservation area of the town, where the average house price is about £550,000.

Elmbridge Borough Council closed the public toilet in 2009 after introducing a community toilet scheme, which allows people to use facilities in shops, pubs and restaurants instead. 

A spokesperson for London-based auctioneers Allsop said: 'It has great potential for redevelopment, subject to obtaining all necessary consents.'

The popular commuter town is in the borough of Elmbridge, home to a number of top schools. The town is also a 25-minute train ride to London Waterloo railway station.

According to Zoopla, the average price for a property in the town is £558,576. This has increased by 9.81 per cent from around £500,000 a year earlier.
