Donna Asutaits who was jailed after making £300,000 without paying a penny in tax must pay back £174,243 or serve two and a half years jail

A £1,000 a night call girl who was jailed after making £300,000 without paying a penny in tax must pay back £174,243 or serve two and a half years jail.

Donna Asutaits, 30, started working as a prostitute to fund a masters degree at the University of Westminster, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Asutaits made so much she was able to afford a £110,000 deposit on her £360,000 apartment in the sought after area of Knightsbridge in March 2007.

When police raided her home they found £73,000 in cash and high value jewellery which was given to her by her clients.

She was jailed for 16 months in July last year after admitting one count of cheating the public revenue.

Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay said the escort failed to file any tax returns for most of her working career.

He added that Asutaits cheated the taxman out of £120,000 between 2005 and 2007.

‘This defendant was working for years as an escort and in that job she received significant sums of money’, Mr Polnay said.

‘To give an example of this was put a deposit on her flat on Brompton Road.

‘This deposit, of £110,000 was paid in cash by the defendant, so clearly that money was available as profit, and available as cash.

‘In addition, in relation to another investigation, police carried out a search of her property and found £72,702 in cash.

‘In addition high value jewellery was found.

‘When this defendant was arrested in relation to this matter in November 2011, a further £6,200 in cash was found.

‘When she was arrested she read out a pre-prepared statement in which she said she had been a self-employed escort for about ten years, and that she was often paid in cash and received valuable jewellery in gifts.’

Judge Peter Testar made an order under the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act for Asutaits to the repay £120,000 she owed in tax with £54,243 in costs.

‘I am told about extensive talks between the parties and it is thought that a fair resolution has been agreed’, Judge Testar said.

‘I am told that the amount that would be regarded in benefit is £173,234 and so that amount will be paid to the Treasury and will no doubt be disposed of in various ways.’

Asutaits, who was in the public gallery for the hearing, is still being investigated for her tax evasion, the court heard.

‘I am told that the defendant is still subject to a continuing investigation by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs into her affairs, so it may be that this inquiry will continue elsewhere’, Judge Testar added.

Stan Reiz, defending, said Asutaits is planning to sell her Knightsbridge flat to help pay the confiscation order.

‘It is lamentable that any young woman should have to come to London and do this kind of work in order to support herself,’ he said.

‘Her family have been embarrassed by these proceedings, not only because of the offence but because they didn’t know she was working as an escort in the first place.

‘The criminal offence was committed in naivety on her part, as she was only 22 when this started.

‘Since this has been hanging over her, she had suffered from depression and insomnia and has taken illicit drugs, and has dropped out of her masters degree.’Asutaits has three months to pay £174,243 or she will face another two-and-a-half years behind bars.
