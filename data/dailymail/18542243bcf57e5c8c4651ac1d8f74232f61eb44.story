Prime Minister Tony Abbott has admitted that people's internet search histories and data will also be used to fight crime in Australia - not just for anti-terrorism purposes.

Mr Abbott has revealed that the government has opened discussions with Internet Service Providers around the country to ensure that the 'Big Brother' policy can be put in place, seeking measures to ensure the digital footprint of all Australians is not lost.

'This is an absolutely vital weapon in the fight against terror and an absolutely vital weapon against crime fighting more generally,' Mr Abbott said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott says 'expert advice' has been provided to the government to ensure metadata storage should be used for all crime-fighting

'An absolutely vital weapon against crime fighting'

The controversial plan to hold on to phone and internet records of all Australians was originally flagged only as part of a suite of dramatic new anti-terror laws announced by the government.

Despite the admission it's now likely to have wider use by authorities, the PM would not be drawn on whether the information kept would be secure.

'It's not what you are doing on the internet, it's the site's you are visiting, it's not the content it's just where you have been.

'It's the person you are sending it to, the person sending it, it's the date and the place it's posted from.'

Metadata is the information kept by 
telecommunications companies - such as phone numbers, email addresses 
and the dates, times, locations and duration of phone calls.

Government officials have begun seeking guarantees from the providers that those details of browsing history will be not be lost.

'There is some risk, as time goes by, that this information will no longer be kept,' added Mr Abbott.

The plan would require bi-partisan support. The Prime Minister is now fighting the announcement on two fronts - including claims the Coalition is no better than the former Gillard Labor Government in breaking election promises.

Mr Abbott said the about-face on the Racial Discrimination Act was about winning back support from ethnic communities and that the stronger anti-terror laws were now a more pressing issue.

But civil liberties groups claim the government's plans are nothing more than 'a smokescreen'.

Terry O'Gorman from the Australian Council of Civil Liberties said that 'this is just propaganda spin by the Prime Minister talking up this problem (terrorist sympathisers)'.

'It's an illogical announcement, nothing more than a deliberate and serious exaggeration,' Mr O'Gorman said.

'There are already sufficient laws in place to deal with anyone caught dealing with extremists and as for metadata being used in ordinary criminal investigations, well this information is already accessible to authorities, without a warrant being required.

'All these so-called announcements have been nothing more than a smokescreen, over their getting rid of the so-called Bolt laws.'
