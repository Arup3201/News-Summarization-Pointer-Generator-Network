A Washington police dog has died after he ingested powdered crystal meth during a massive bust that led to 44 pounds of narcotics being seized by authorities.

Barney was serving a search warrant with his handler, Tacoma police officer Henry Betts, when he accidentally inhaled the methamphetamine and became sick. 

The 11-year-old Labrador mix had a body temperature of 109 and was having seizures when he was brought to BluePearl Veterinary Hospital on Tuesday night.

Barney was becoming more alert and responsive by Wednesday morning and doctors and doctors were 'cautiously optimistic' that he would make a full recovery.

He died on Thursday.  

Officer Betts and Barney had been partnered up since 2010.

Betts said: 'He's a phenomenal dog.

'Really just incredible.'

Narcotics dogs usually signal when drugs are present by placing their noses on the substance. 

Barney put his sniffer on the unwrapped drugs and came in direct contact with the meth, Q13 Fox reported. 

Dr. Kobi Johnson said: ''Methamphetamines are extremely toxic to dogs.'

As a result of the canine's courageous actions, three men were arrested.

Samuel Tafolla Hernandez, 39, Thomas Servantes Diaz, 34, and Jose Mauricio Lozano-Miranda, 38, were all charged Wednesday with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.

Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist said: 'This is one of the biggest drug busts we've seen in Pierce County in the last decade.'

In addition to the meth, officers found $225,000 concealed in a book case during the bust. 

The men are scheduled to make their initial court appearance Thursday afternoon.
