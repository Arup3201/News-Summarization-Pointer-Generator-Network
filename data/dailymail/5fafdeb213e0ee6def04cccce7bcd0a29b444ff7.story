A Los Angeles woman has created an Instagram account which allows women to share all of the weird, wacky - and sometimes downright horrifying - messages that they receive from men via dating websites and apps like Tinder. 

Alexandra Tweten created the Bye Felipe account as a means of allowing women to air some of their more outrageous online dating interactions, after realizing how many obscene and offensive messages she and her friends were receiving on a daily basis. 

'I realized these hostile messages were a trend that women see online,' the operations coordinator told The Huffington Post.

Rude and ridiculous: Some of the messages featured include insults about appearance, while others are aggressive and sometimes even violent

'It shows our cultural misogyny problem': Alexandra believes there is a pattern to the behavior of many of the men featured, with the majority lashing out as a result of being rejected 

'That started a conversation about creating an Instagram to keep all of these insane messages so we could discuss them. All women get some degree of creepy or weird messages when they sign up for online dating sites.'

Alexandra hopes that the account will help women who have suffered any kind of hostile or abusive dating messages to realize that they are not alone. And having sifted through a seemingly-endless stream of submissions, she points out that there is a clear and obvious pattern in the behavior of almost all of the aggressive messengers.

'It's a standard reaction that I've now seen over and over again with the submissions,' she added.

'Guy hits on girl, girl doesn't respond, guy lashes out with insulting message. It really shows the entitlement these guys feel, and I think it shows our cultural misogyny problem.'

While some of the submissions featured are too rude to repeat, others are slightly more ridiculous and include a variety of extraordinary comebacks from jaded gentlemen, irate at the thought of being turned down.

'I am not interested': A lot of the women who send in submissions to the account are very clear about their feelings early on in the conversation, however their honesty is rarely met with a reasonable response

Downright rude: Many of the women find themselves facing a barrage of indecent questions

One woman, after seemingly ignoring a man's advances, was told: 'Yeahhhh so I have come to the conclusion that you are a Class A b***h. With toe nail fungus and you probably like to eat Cheetos while you watch reruns of Gossip Girl.'

Another, who dared to respond to one of the numerous insults being hurled in her direction, received a message telling her to 'cut her face off with a bottle'.

Thus far the account has almost 26,000 followers, a number which is continuing to grow by the hour as word spreads to other disgruntled women. Alexandra is hopeful that it will have an impact on at least a few of the men who are featured - and perhaps even encourage them to change their attitude towards women and the online dating community. 

She said: 'Maybe a guy will see it and put a second thought into sending a woman a mean message.'
