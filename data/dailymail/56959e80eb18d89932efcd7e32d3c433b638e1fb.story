The U.S. Marshals have identified an accused fraudster, that allegedly scammed donors out of $100 million through a fake veterans' charity, as a fugitive who has been evading the FBI since 1987.

Law enforcement officials said on Monday that the alleged charity scam artist known as Bobby Thompson has been positively identified as John Donald Cody, a fugitive who is wanted on previous fraud charges and as part of an espionage investigation. 

In a case filled with intrigue and 
infiltration of powerful political circles, Cody has been dubbed a con 
man extraordinaire who will finally be prosecuted for his decades-old crimes.

It is now known that the man who evaded 
the FBI for decades had a prestigious educational background, with a 
degree from the University of Virginia (UVA) and a law degree from 
Harvard.

He
had been a U.S. Army Captain in Military Intelligence and previously 
practiced law in Sierra Vista, Arizona from 1980 to 1984.

During his law career in Arizona, he became the subject of an investigation over claims he was stealing money from his clients but Cody skipped town before he could be apprehended and since 1987 has been a fugitive from the FBI.

According to a federal warrant, dated May 4, 1987 out of the Eastern 
District of Virginia, Cody is charged with interstate transportation of 
fraudulent traveler’s checks from probate estates’ bank accounts, false 
statements to an investment brokerage firm, and false statements on loan
applications.

A
former colleague, Dennis Lusk, now chief judge of the Arizona Motor 
Vehicle Division, had worked with Cody in Arizona and remembered him as 
bizarre.

He described the attorney as 'intelligent enough to get through Harvard Law School and was a great talker and BS-er,' in an interview with the Arizona Republic in 2002.

As part of his life on the run, he 
assumed a number of aliases, the most publicized being Bobby Thompson - 
the high profile head of the U.S. Navy Veterans Association - a fake veterans' charity that took in $100 million in donations.

'The USNVA claimed to have a national headquarters in Washington D.C., but its base of operations was the Tampa, FL, area,' according to a FBI statement. 

'From
its inception [in the early 2000s] to the summer of 2010, it is 
estimated the USNVA received close to $100 million dollars in nationwide
donations.'

Thompson 
gained notoriety for his efforts and worked his way into the Beltway 
elite, through donations to prominent politicians.

The non profit group boasted a membership of over 
66,000 members in 40 states but little of the money raised ever made its
way to assist military service members.

Wanted: The FBI has been searching for John Donald Cody since 1987

Law enforcement officials began investigating Thompson and he was charged with multiple counts of fraud in 2010.

Once again, the man, known as Thompson, abandoned his identity and set off on a cross-country 
journey using numerous aliases to evade police.

From June 2010 to May 2012, investigators believe he hid out in Massachusetts, Arizona, New 
Mexico Rhode Island, West Virginia, Indiana, Florida, Washington and ultimately Portland, Oregon - where he was finally caught.

He
was arrested at a boarding house where he had rented a room, and 
investigators say one of the few belongings they found was a DVD of 
Catch Me If You Can, the Leonardo DiCaprio drama chronicling the wild 
history of convicted conman Frank Abagnale.

Investigators
also discovered his storage unit, where he had suitcases full of cash, 
totaling $981,000 - a far cry from the $100 million that is unaccounted 
for.

'This was one of our most challenging fugitive 
investigations to date,' U.S. Marshal Peter Elliott stated at the time of Thompson's arrest, according to a statement.

'Our investigators followed up leads all over the nation. 
Their diligence and dedication directly led to the arrest in Portland. I am 
proud of everyone that worked on this investigation and their efforts have 
brought this scam artist to justice,' he added.

But the elusive suspect remained shrouded in mystery even after his arrest.

He wanted only to be referred to as Mr. X, leaving investigators baffled as to his true identity.

He also showed off his legal prowess in the courtroom, daring officials to try and discover who he truly was.

Elliott, the agent who was key in apprehending Thompson, began to research Thompson - conducting simple Google searches of cold case fraud fugitives and looking for any connections to the man that had been arrested.

He spotted the FBI photos of Cody, from the 1987 charges, and noticed a physical resemblance to Thompson, in addition to striking similarities in their MOs.

A positive fingerprint match confirmed that Thompson was in fact Cody.

Now that it has been established that Cody and Thompson are indeed one and the same, the 65-year-old will now face the 1987 charges, combined with the 2010 charges from the charity scam and he is also wanted for questioning in connection with a FBI espionage investigation.

The FBI has not yet provided more 
details into the espionage case but it's believed Cody's former career as an intelligence officer could be involved. Additionally, he had lived in Sierra Vista, Arizona  - which is located next to Fort Huachuca, a major intelligence hub for the military.
