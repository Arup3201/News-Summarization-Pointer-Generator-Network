A woman who attacked her husband with a hammer in rural Queensland after he questioned her about her debts has been sentenced to eight years prison.

Kay Lyons, from Wattlecamp - about 200km north-west of Brisbane, pleaded guilty at Brisbane Supreme Court to the attempted murder of David Lyons who she bludgeoned over the head with a hammer on June 4, 2013.

David was sitting at his computer desk when his wife of 36 years ambushed him from behind after he discovered an email to their accountant from the 54-year-old woman saying she needed more time to pay her debts because her daughter had died, which was untrue.

It was discovered Kay had a crippling gambling addiction and had wracked up $10,000 on their joint credit card.

But when David decided to confront her about it, Kay snapped and almost beat him to death in their home.

'She hit me once, one heavy blow, and I fell off the chair and she sort of followed me down and kept hitting,' he told A Current Affair.

'She said: "I’m going to kill you", she said: "Why won’t you die? I can’t live with you and can’t live without you".'

Still conscious but feeling faint and dizzy, David stumbled into the next room to grab a towel to wrap around his head before walking out onto the street and hailing down a passing car for help.

David was airlifted to hospital and was treated for serious injuries.

'There was a possibility I would have died,' he said.

The pensioner said he had forgiven her for the attack but saw it as the ultimate betrayal. He has made the decision to end their marriage.

'If you can’t trust your wife of over 30 years with your life, who would you trust?' David said.

The Lyons' daughter, Amanda, said her father was 'devoted' to her mother and wished she had asked for assistance.

'All she needed to do was tell someone she was having trouble,' she said.

A former friend of Kay - who wished to remain anonymous, said the 54-year-old was left troubled after her job at a youth care services company.

'That’s what I think pushed her over the edge,' the former friend - who had known Kay for about seven years - told Daily Mail Australia.

'Her life was threatened on the job and she was a bit traumatised by that.

'She was also a trauma by her daughter’s birth. Her daughter was born with her intestines were on the outside.'

The former friend said she felt sad that Kay was going to jail but 'the law is the law'.

'We got along really well and she called me her sister and I feel bad for not visiting her in jail,' she said.

'I know she liked to gamble. She’d lose herself for a while at a poker machine but I had no problem with that.

'I didn’t know she had running up debts.'

Kay will be eligible for parole on June 1, 2016.
