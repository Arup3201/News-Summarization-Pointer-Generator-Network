With his studs up, Prince Harry does a good impression of Chelsea legend Ron ‘Chopper’ Harris with this ugly tackle.

The challenge could have earned a red card if his boots had made contact with his opponent in a competitive game. But that didn’t stop him making other heavy-handed attempts to win the ball in a festive friendly – even if his brother William was on the receiving end.

The two princes were playing on opposite sides in the now-traditional Christmas Eve fixture involving estate workers near the Queen’s Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.

Studs up: Prince Harry lunges aggressively into a tackle during the charity Christmas football match

Steady on: Prince Harry slides in for a tackle on his brother The Duke of Cambridge during the match at Sandringham estate

Tired: The 29-year-old who, was playing on the opposing side to his brother William, looked worn out after recently returning from his 200-mile trek to the South Pole

While the banter was relatively 
friendly, it was clear that the brothers were playing to win as they 
clattered into each other on the rain-sodden pitch at Castle Rising.

At
 one stage, Harry, 29 – still bearded from his Antarctic charity trek – 
made fun of an opponent’s corner kick. William, 31, jokingly pleaded 
with the referee to issue a card, saying: ‘Give him yellow, give him 
yellow – backchat.’

The
 Duke of Cambridge, who was wearing a red and white striped shirt and 
light blue Aston Villa socks in honour of his favourite team, was also seen 
throwing himself into the game.

Rugged: The prince was still sporting the beard he grew during his recent expedition to the South Pole as he joined villagers and estate workers for the match

Embrace: The two brothers hugged at the end of the game, which ended in a 2-2 draw

Post-match: The two princes congratulated teammates and opposition after the game

Eye on the ball: Prince William also got stuck into the annual fixture, and wore the socks from his beloved Aston Villa

With his thinning hair, onlookers said the 31-year-old looked like former England footballer Bobby Charlton.

Army pilot Harry’s competitive streak saw him battle
 hard to win the match for his team – with a  tackling style reminiscent
 of Ron ‘Chopper’ Harris, renowned as one of the toughest defenders of 
the 1960s and 1970s.

When they went a goal down to William’s side 
after ten minutes, the younger prince soon scored to put them level. 
Covered in mud, Harry’s team, in white tops, came from behind again in 
the second half and the game eventually finished at 2-2.

The princes then proved they were still the best of friends by hugging after the final whistle in the match between Sandringham estate workers and villagers from Castle Rising blew.

One of the players was injured during the
 match and was taken to hospital, but the game continued and the teams 
shook hands at the end.

Around 100 locals turned out to watch the match and Prince William was seen mingling with spectators at half time.

Speed and skill: The brothers showed off their footballing prowess with William (left) teeing up a volley and Harry looking to out run a defender as he latches onto a pass

An
 onlooker said: ‘William and Harry are both fairly reasonable players – 
but it seemed that Harry had the edge when it came to fitness. It is 
probably not surprising because Harry is a serving soldier and has just 
come back from a 200 mile trek to the South Pole.

‘Harry was getting 
around all over the pitch and was beating his brother in most 
challenges, but William won his fair share of balls.

‘It was a very good-natured game with no serious fouls or injuries, but they were not shy about steaming into each other.’

The
 Duchess of Cambridge stayed at Sandringham with Prince George. But 
Princess Anne’s son Peter Phillips watched from the touchline with his 
wife and two daughters.They had gathered at Sandringham to celebrate Christmas, surrounded by 30 members of the Royal Family.

The referee's verdict: Graham Poll said Harry was 'a little over exuberant'
