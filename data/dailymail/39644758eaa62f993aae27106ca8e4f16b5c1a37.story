Striking photos have emerged of the ongoing recovery in New Orleans in the years after Hurricane Katrina hit.

The category four storm ravaged the Louisiana city in 2005 - it was one of the worst affected areas because it is below sea level.

The images show how the speed of recovery across the city varied - in some photos the landscape looks exactly the same with just the water draining away.

But others indicate the true damage of the hurricane  and show that even five years after the disaster - when these photos were taken - the city was struggling to rebuild itself.

There was much criticism of the authorities for their handling of the disaster - although many people were evacuated, it was a slow process and the poorest and most vulnerable were left behind.

One million people were made homeless and about 1,200 people drowned in the floods. 

It was the costliest natural disaster in American history and $50 billion in aid was given by the government.

Photographer Juan Carlos,  who took the 'after' photos in 2011, says: 'The city is still a constant reminder of that tragic day and what came after.

'The city has not been fully recovered nor rebuilt; many areas are barely starting reconstruction other areas as still abandoned and no sign of rebuilding or progress. 

'One can still see the damage, feel the pain and hear the stories of what happened five years. 

'Mostly everyone has a story to tell and they all have a common conclusion; New Orleans recovery has been slow.'
