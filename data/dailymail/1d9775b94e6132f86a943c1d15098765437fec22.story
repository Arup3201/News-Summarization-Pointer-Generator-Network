Matt Lauer and Al Roker have undergone prostate exams live on the Today show in a bid to dispel myths about the potentially life-saving procedure.

The hosts went to Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, where Dr. David Samadi, a urologist, carried out a rectal exam on each of the men in an examination room off-screen.

Lauer came out after just 34 seconds and said the procedure had been quick and simple.

'It doesn't hurt at all,' he said. 'Is it the best 34 seconds of your life? Probably not, but if in 34 seconds a doctor can detect something 
that could save your life, what are we talking about?'

Dispelling myths: Al Roker (second left) and Matt Lauer (second right) underwent prostate exams on the Today show this morning with Dr David Samadi, left. The procedure took seconds

Heading inside: The clock starts ticking as Lauer, who has a family history of the disease, heads for the test

Quick: Dr Samadi emerged from the room to speak with Roker and Dr Nancy Snyderman after 34 seconds

The procedure involves a manual 
digital examination of the prostate gland to see whether it is a normal 
size and shape. If doctors feel any nodules on the prostate, further 
checks are required.

It
is one of the ways that can detect the early stages of prostate cancer 
and is often part of routine physical checkups for men, but some choose 
to skip it because of the discomfort.

But
if it is detected early, prostate cancer is one of the most treatable. 
One in six men can expect to be diagnosed with the cancer in his 
lifetime, and each year it claims around 29,000 lives.

After
his test with Dr Samadi, Al Roker added that it was not particularly 
comfortable but that it was 'certainly, obviously do-able'.

Making light of it: Dr Samadi joked that he was going to be extra thorough by checking with 2 fingers

Horror: From left to right, fellow hosts Natalie Morales, Savannah Guthrie and Tamron Hall react to the tests

If
prostate cancer is detected early, it is one of the most treatable. But many cases remain undetected
because of the perceived embarrassment surrounding the prostate examination; each year 
it claims around 29,000 lives and it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men.

While undergoing a rectal examination does not seem like the most comfortable prospect, the seconds-long check could potentially save your life.

The procedure involves a manual 
digital examination of the prostate gland to see whether it is a normal 
size and shape. If doctors feel any nodules on the prostate, which is usually a spongey consistency, further 
blood checks are required.

Another test that men undergo to detect prostate cancer is a PSA blood test, which checks for elevated levels of protein in the blood.

One
in six men can expect to be diagnosed with the cancer in his lifetime 
and the average age of diagnosis is 67.

Lauer added: 'I think a lot of guys are also concerned about the embarrassment factor of it, so my advice would be find a doctor you're very comfortable with. That embarrassment factor is not going to be an issue.'

Dr Samadi said that the prostates felt normal, adding of Roker's: 'It's a little enlarged, but it's not terrible.'

He said that if he had felt any problems, he would have given the men antibiotics in case it was simply an infection, before carrying out blood work.

Both of the men had already undergone the first part of the test to detect any prostate issues - a 'PSA' blood test, which checks for elevated levels of protein in the blood.

Lauer said that he had been having regular blood checks with Dr Samadi for the past five years because he has a family history of prostate issues. But the doctor said his PSA had stayed steady.

Dr Samadi suggested that men should start having the test after the age of 40.

Lauer and Roker have also been growing beards since the start of the month for 'No Shave November' - joining other men across the country in a bid to raise awareness of male cancers.

Before the check, the hosts said they 
were undergoing the procedure to dispel the myths around it and to show 
just how easy it is.

'We're
trying to raise awareness, trying to get men of a certain age to go to 
the doctors to raise some of these issues,' Lauer said. 'A lot of people
have fears or concerns. We're going to show you just how quick this 
procedure is.'

Checks: As well as carrying out the prostate exam, doctors take a PSA blood test to detect the levels of protein in the blood, which can be an indicator of issues. Here, Roker receives the blood test

Pre-test nerves: Al Roker looked concerned before he had the test, as co-hosts Natalie Morales and Savannah Guthrie posed wearing gloves. The fellow hosts and viewers commended the men for undergoing the test

Roker chimed in: 'For men over 40 - everyone should at least get this once.'

Ahead of the tests, Natalie Morales and Savannah Guthrie posed on set wearing gloves while a concerned Al Roker looked on.

The Today show hasn't shied away from more grisly health checks in the past.

It comes more than a decade after Katie Couric famously underwent a colonoscopy live on the Today show as 6.7 million viewers tuned in - changing how many viewed the procedure.

Couric, who also had a mammogram live on TV in 2005, had the colonoscopy after her 
husband died in 1998 from colon cancer, and when she left the show in 
2006, she said it had been her proudest accomplishment.
