A new law being introduced to protect teachers from malicious allegations of crimes against pupils could have hindered the hunt for Megan Stammers and Jeremy Forrest.

The Education Act, which comes into force next week, gives anonymity to teachers accused of committing criminal offences against children at their school.

The law was introduced amid fears over a number of false allegations of abuse or physical assault made by pupils and parents against teachers in recent years.

Hunt: But under legislation to be introduced next week it might have been illegal to have named 15-year-old Megan Stammers (left)  who  fled to France with her teacher Jeremy Forrest

But the controversial legislation – enforced by fines of up to £5,000 – could have unintended implications in future cases similar to the hunt for missing Megan.

Under Clause 13, anonymity ends only if the teacher is charged with a criminal offence or a court agrees to an application that it is in the interests of the justice that it should be lifted.

Anonymity also ends if an arrest warrant is issued, but in Megan’s case that didn’t happen until Tuesday – four days after her disappearance was reported to police.

Under the legislation, it might be illegal to have even named Megan or her school because by doing so it could lead to the identification of her teacher.

Critics say the Bill could also mean that an accused teacher might move from one school to another without allegations being  properly recorded and aired if there is not a criminal charge.

During the Bill’s passage concerned peers in the House of Lords described the new anonymity law as ‘an unprecedented attack on free speech’ and as the hunt for Megan intensified yesterday media organisations warned of the legislation’s ‘unintended consequences’.

The Newspaper Society, which promotes the interests of Britain’s regional and local media, was among organisations lobbying against the new law.

Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: ‘In trying to protect teachers from being falsely accused you are actually putting children at greater risk.

Here they are trying to deal with one problem, teachers being falsely accused, by creating another. That is the law of unintended consequences.’

The Education Act 2011 comes into force on Monday and means that teachers become the first group of people in British legal history to be given automatic anonymity when they are accused of a criminal offence.

The Society of Editors, in a letter to peers, warned that the measures would be a ‘gross inhibition on freedom of speech’, adding: ‘It would set a very dangerous precedent as people could be convicted for telling the truth.’

Mr Satchwell warned: ‘It will be a criminal offence for anyone – pupil, parent, police, school, local authority, whistle-blower, media – even to inform parents or the general public that an identified teacher has admitted that the allegation is true and has resigned, has been disciplined, or even cautioned for the offence.’

He added: ‘Although we acknowledge 
teachers’ fears about false accusations, the most important issue is 
surely to protect children.

‘Malicious
allegations by pupils are extremely rare and alongside this, the laws 
of libel, contempt and confidence already restrict newspapers from 
repeating and publishing unsubstantiated accusations.’

Under
the Act, anonymity can also end if the Education Secretary publishes 
information about the teacher in connection with an investigation or 
decision in a disciplinary case. The teacher may also waive his or her 
anonymity.
