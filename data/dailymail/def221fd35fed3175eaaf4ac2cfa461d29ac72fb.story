The former boyfriend of Amanda Knox has spoken of how his life is 'on hold' as he faces a retrial over the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher.

Italy’s highest criminal court ruled in March that an appeals court must re-hear the case against Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the murder 
of the 21-year-old, from Coulsdon, Surrey.

It came after convictions against the pair were thrown out in October 2011.

Victim: The pair were found guilty in December 2009 of murdering Meredith Kercher but after an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown out in October 2011

Speaking on ITV’s Daybreak, Mr Sollecito said: 'Every tiny little day, it is constantly
 on my shoulder, because these trials, this kind of situation, has put 
my life on hold.

'I cannot find a normal life, a job, a 
career or something to focus on instead of thinking about the trial, 
about the documents, about what will happen, about how to pay lawyers, 
how to pay my bills,' he said.

Sollecito has always denied any involvement in the killing of the Leeds University student. She 
was found with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house in Perugia
 in central Italy that she shared with American Miss Knox in November 
2007.

The pair were found guilty in December 
2009 of murdering Miss Kercher, with Miss Knox sentenced to 26 years in 
prison and Mr Sollecito 25.

But, after an 11-month appeal in a Perugia court, both convictions were thrown out in October 2011.Prosecutors claimed that Miss Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone awry.

Mr Sollecito is due to face a retrial on September 30. But Miss Knox’s lawyer revealed last month that she will not return to Italy for the new trial.

Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito have consistently protested their innocence and claim they were not even in the apartment on the night Miss Kercher died.

They were convicted following a high-profile trial but were released after an appeals court found the prosecution lacking and criticised large swathes of the case against them.

The case mounted against them by prosecutors was ripped apart by the Italian appeals court, which noted that the murder weapon was never found, DNA tests were faulty and prosecutors provided no motive for murder.

Mr Sollecito has defended himself against claims that he and Miss Knox had made money out of the tragedy. He has said he wants Italian prosecutors to read his book to find out the facts about the case.

Speaking about his romance with Miss 
Knox, Mr Sollecito said: 'It was a teenage romance, it was a blossoming,
 we were eager to date each other to see each other every day.

'But as soon as we dated and we started to have this romance, it was shut down, it was destroyed by events and circumstances.'

Rudy Guede, a small-time drug dealer from the Ivory Coast, is the only person who remains behind bars over the case in Italy, where he is serving a 16-year sentence for sexually assaulting and killing the British student.

He has always admitted being present at Miss Kercher’s home on the night of the murder but denied involvement.
