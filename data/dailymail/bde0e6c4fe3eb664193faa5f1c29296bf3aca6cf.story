A series of box office flops have led DreamWorks Animations to announce plans to axe over 400 jobs in its latest round of layoffs.

The planned job losses are aimed at cutting operating costs at the Glendale studio which is trimming its existing workforce.

Insiders told The LA Times the precise number of people who will lose their jobs is unknown but it is expected to exceed the 350 layoffs that occurred in 2003.

Those affected will include production staff, animators and story-board artists at the studio's Glendale and Redwood City facilities, which employ about 2,200 workers.

However, a spokesman for DreamWorks would not confirm or deny the layoffs and told The LA Times that the company 'does not comment on rumor and speculation.'

Dreamworks has also undergone a shake-up of management recently.

Longtime DreamWorks executive Bill Damaschke, the studio's chief creative officer left and veteran producers Bonnie Arnold and Mireille Soria have taken over as co-presidents of feature animation.

It has been a difficult few years for the popular studio, responsible for big animated blockbusters like Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and the Madagascar movies.

Profits have been affected by a lack of enthusiasm for its latest offerings.

The company reported three write-downs in the last two years for 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman,' 'Rise of the Guardians' and 'Turbo.'

The studio's most recent release, 'Penguins of Madagascar,' also bombed since its premiere in November.

It has struggled to find the formula that made its earlier movies big hits.  

CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has been in discussions to sell the studio, but has come up against problems.

He was turned down by Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank Corp., Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox and toymaker Hasbro Inc.
