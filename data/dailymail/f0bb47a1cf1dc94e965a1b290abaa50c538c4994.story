Fears of a BBC whitewash over the Jimmy Savile scandal grew last night amid claims ‘key criticisms’ have been ‘gutted’ for ‘legal reasons’ from a review of its handling of the affair.

Corporation chiefs are planning to release thousands of pages of evidence given to former Sky News boss Nick Pollard – who oversaw an independent inquiry into why a Newsnight investigation into the late entertainer’s paedophile past was shelved.

But last night a source claimed ‘heavy redactions’ have been made to critical comments about BBC bosses. They added that it no longer gave ‘an honest picture’.

Savile scandal: Corporation chiefs are planning to release thousands of pages of evidence given to former Sky News boss Nick Pollard ¿ who oversaw an independent inquiry into why a Newsnight investigation into the late entertainer¿s paedophile past was shelved.

Mr Pollard produced his report last December, based on texts, emails and oral testimony, which found there had been ‘chaos and confusion’ at the BBC over the controversy.

At the time, BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten had also promised to release full transcripts of the evidence.

He said the Corporation would only remove information from the documents where it was legally compelled to.

But BBC insiders have confirmed the ‘worst stuff’ affecting highly-paid corporation figures has been removed by lawyers.

One, familiar with the contents of the 3,000 pages, which are expected to be published on Friday, said removed passages appeared to go ‘way beyond’ any ‘narrow definition of defamatory’.

The BBC had claimed it would only remove lines from the report where it legally had to, notably where the comments defamed a member of staff.

Earlier this week it emerged that Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman’s scathing criticism of his senior colleagues over their handling of the Savile crisis has been struck out.

Comments by director of global news Peter Horrocks are also understood to have been cut.

An insider close to the process said: 
‘There are heavy redactions of criticisms of management. Most of what 
people are hoping to find in there has already gone.’

However, another senior BBC source said the disclosures would still be ‘pretty unedifying’ for the corporation.

Others have said there are real legal issues with the evidence, but confirmed the published documents will still be deeply embarrassing for the BBC.

Tory MP Mark Pritchard said: ‘The BBC needs to disclose this information if it is to restore public trust and avoid accusations of a whitewash.

‘It should not make the same mistakes as it made some months in being reluctant to release relevant information.’

It is understood there has been a ‘battle’ between the BBC Trust and the BBC’s executive body over how much to remove.

The BBC Trust is said to have wanted to put in as much as possible while the management arm has been more cautious.

A
spokesman said: ‘The Trust will need to be satisfied that what is 
published is in line with the expectations of transparency that have 
previously been set out.

A BBC Spokesman said: 'We made a promise to publish all the relevant material that helped Nick Pollard in the preparation of his report, and we will do so next week.

'Other than material that has to be redacted for a strict set of legal reasons, they will be published in full.  We expect the total amount redacted to be a very small part of the whole.'

Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, suggested people felt it unfair that the banks' financial success had not been shared by the public

BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has suggested that anger at the banks over the collapse of the economy has at times been ‘infused’ with ‘envious populism’.

He suggested people felt it unfair that the banks’ financial success had not been shared by the public – who were then expected to bail them out when things went wrong.

He added: ‘Often the outrage has been justified; but we have to beware allowing that anger to become infused from time to time with envious populism.’

The former governor of Hong Kong also claimed politicians get more blame than they deserve when things go wrong and suggested the expenses scandal was not ‘people on the fiddle’, rather a case of the rules ‘appearing to have been stretched further than appeared fair or seemly’.

Giving the Geddes Lecture in Oxford yesterday Lord Patten, the university’s chancellor, covered a range of issues, in a speech called Trust and Free Speech.

Speaking about the Savile scandal he admitted the ‘really difficult questions for the BBC today’ were raised by the ‘lapses in editorial judgement’ on Newsnight and its sluggish response to the crisis.

He said it was right the BBC pursues the truth about itself ‘even when it is grisly’.
