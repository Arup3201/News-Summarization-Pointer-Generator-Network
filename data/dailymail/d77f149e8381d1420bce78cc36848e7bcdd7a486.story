A Swedish Instagram user has recreated newlywed Solange Knowles' now-iconic bridal party portrait using six Barbie dolls.

Ronny Larsson, a magazine editor from Stockholm, even designed and fitted a doll-sized replica of the bride's Humberto Leon for Kenzo wedding dress, as well as the stylish ensembles worn by her sister Beyonce, mother Tina Knowles and three of her closest friends.

The image is part of an online advent calendar project which sees Ronny recreate a different iconic image from 2014 every day and has already caught the attention of 28-year-old Solange who wasted no time in thanking him for taking the time to create the doll-sized tribute to her special day.

So chic: The original version, which was published by Vogue, features Solange's sister Beyonce, her mother Tina and a group of her best friends

'Solange not only put a wonderful post on my Instagram, she also tweeted a personal thank you and how moved she was by this,' Ronny told MailOnline.

'That was such a nice gesture of her.' 

Following Solange's interest in the image, Ronny's Instagram account became an overnight social media sensation and now boasts 1,200 followers - a number which is continuing to grow by the minute. 

'The response has been amazing. I never thought that a picture I took on my hallway floor would be something that people talked about all over the world,' he added. 

'It sure puts some pressure on the following posts on [my account].' 

Luckily, Ronny is not short of ideas when it comes to his future posts - and is already busy working on his upcoming creations.

Getting her groove on: Ronny believes that the video of the First Lady dancing with a turnip is one of 2014's most memorable moments

'I have some plans,' he confessed. 'It has been a great year for female popstars so I have to do something with that. The Chandelier-video with Sia, or should I say without, is quite iconic.

'And after the Solange wedding I must try to do something with that big Kanye and Kim Kardashian wedding.

'Also, I would have to do something British. Maybe Downton Abbey, which I love.'

As for his inspiration, Ronny admits that he always wanted to ask for a Barbie doll for Christmas as a child - but was too embarrassed to list the popular toy on his list. Now, as an adult, this project gives him total freedom to work and play with the dolls as much as he likes.

'I just had this thought about an advent calendar that day for day would count down to Christmas Eve,' he said. 

'Every day I would arrange a pop cultural phenomenon, or something that has had us buzzing on social media during 2014.

She came in like a wrecking ball... and removed all of her music from Spotify: The Instagram account also features this image, which is a combination of Miley Cyrus' controversial music video and Taylor Swift's decision to 'quit' Spotify

'Also, as a child I always wanted a Barbie but was to ashamed to ask for it for Christmas.'

As well designer Solange, Ronny's Instagram account features pint-sized recreations of a wide variety of famous faces. 

 First Lady Michelle Obama's hilarious 'turnip for what' parody video was given the Barbie treatment on December 8, while Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Vanderpump and her beloved canine companion Jiggy are also featured. 

When it came to picking his first subject however, Ronny opted for singer Taylor Swift, choosing to position her on a Miley Cyrus-style wrecking ball which bears the logo for music sharing site Spotify.

'Taylor Swift on a wrecking ball sits when she from Spotify removes her hits,' the accompanying comment reads, referring to the 24-year-old's decision to prevent the site from using any of her music.
