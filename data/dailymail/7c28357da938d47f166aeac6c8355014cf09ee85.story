The first pictures of the proposed new second runway at Gatwick airport have been revealed with the man leading the plans claiming it would boost the local ecomony just like the Olympics did for east London.

Leading architectural planner Sir Terry Farrell is hoping to persuade the government that a Gatwick expansion would provide scope for economic growth for both jobs, housing and regeneration in south London.

Pictures of the Sussex airport have also been released which show the propsed second runway, that could be operational by 2025, if it gets the go-ahead.

It is estimated that British trade and investment was given a Â£9.9 billion boost following the Games and it is also thought that an additional 17, 900 jobs per year would be created in London between 2012 and 2015 thanks to the Olympics.

The first pictures of how a second runway at Gatwick Airport have been unveiled. If it gets the go-ahead it is claimed it could bring a massive economic boost to south London

Leading architect Sir Terry Farrell believes an expansion to Gatwick Airport would provide an Olympic style boost to the local economy, similar to the one in East London after holding the games in 2012

And Sir Terry believes a Gatwick expansion would see an Olympic style regeneration for the south-east of England stretching from Croydon to Brighton.

He said: 'I have no doubt that with a second runway, Gatwick will deliver more balanced, and more widely spread, economic growth for London and the South East.

'Expansion at Gatwick could do for South London and the wider region what the Olympics did for East London and give a huge boost in terms of jobs, housing and regeneration.'

The new pictures of the proposed runway were part of the launch of the 'Gatwick Obviously' campaign, which claims a second runway at Gatwick could provide more connections to more destinations than a third runway at Heathrow.

Heathrow is the UK's only hub airport and though it does not oppose a second runway at Gatwick or the extending of smaller airports around the UK, it argues that freight is a vital component of the economy and and this is part of the essential role played by Heathrow.

The campaign also say that a second runway is needed at the airport to cater for short-haul flights to Europe and that a Gatwick expansion would provide better balanced growth for London and the South East, in particular for south London, including Croydon and down to Brighton and the south coast.

Gatwick Airport presented its findings to political and business leaders at the Shard in London.

Gatwick chief operating officer Stewart Wingate said: 'The next runway needs to bring the greatest economic return for the UK at the lowest environmental cost.

'That makes Gatwick the obvious answer as we will be able to connect to more destinations in the future because we are the only airport to cater for all airline models.

'It is the best solution that embraces long term aviation trends. It can also be delivered in less time with less cost and less noise.'
