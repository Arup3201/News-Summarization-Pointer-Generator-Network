A well-known local television news reporter was allegedly punched in the neck by a woman wearing a bed sheet who had allegedly broken into her news van, ate her snacks, and started applying her makeup.

Vivian Lee, who works for local New York news station NY1, was reporting on the death of a Brooklyn man who was killed in the recent super storm that passed through the city Thursday night, when a woman came up to her and allegedly punched her in the throat.

The reporter, who has been with the station since 2008, said that as a journalist, she’s been put through the ringer, but this inexplicable assault left her trembling. ‘I felt very, very vulnerable,’ she said from a hospital after the attack.

Ms Lee was in Cobble Hill reporting on the death of Richard Schwartz, a 61-year-old state prosecutor who was killed when the storm sent scaffolding careering on top of him.

A witness told DNAInfo that they saw a woman, identified later as 24-year-old Theresa Casivant, wearing a white sheet over flip flops and sweat pants enter the NY1 news van around 7am EST on Friday.

The witness then said the woman proceeded to use Ms Lee’s makeup and nibble on her food.

Ms Lee told the New York Post that she thought Casivant could be mentally ill. ‘I just wanted her out of my truck,’ she explained. 

When Ms Lee asked Casivant to leave, the 24-year-old Brooklyn resident refused. A NY1 truck operator had to drag her out of the news van.  Still, the woman wouldn’t leave.

Ms Lee told the Post: ‘I said, “What is your issue? Are you lost? Are you homeless? Are you sick?”’ and after those comments, Casivant allegedly struck out at her throat. 

She and the news crew held Casivant until NYPD officers arrived at the scene; Casivant was later charged with assault.

Ms Lee said she is used to every kind of
 response, saying that she’s been spat at, sworn at, and even sexually 
assaulted. But she said that a punch to the neck was a low blow.

Food for thought: She allegedly entered a NY1 news van like this one, eating Ms Lee's snacks and putting on her makeup

Mother: Casivant's Twitter profile says she is a mother of two and engaged

Chaotic scene: State prosecutor
Richard Schwartz, 61, was killed by falling scaffolding and debris in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, during last Thursday's storm; Ms Lee was on-scene Friday morning to report

‘I’m not a print reporter, I need this voice box,’ she told the paper.

A spokesperson told DNAInfo that Casivant was taken to Long Island College Hospital for a psych evaluation.

According to her Twitter page, she has two young sons, and is engaged. Her last tweet, from August 19, 2011, reads: ‘I couldn’t be any happier with the family that I have! I <3 you ALL!!!’

Ms Lee kept a level head about the alleged attack, telling DNAInfo: ‘It could’ve been worse. This does happen to a lot of media people.’

NY1 is a 24-hour news station operated by Time Warner Cable, and reports on news from around New York's five boroughs.
