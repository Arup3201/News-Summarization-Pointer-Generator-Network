A hilarious new video that featuring five young girls dropping the F-word numerous times is hoping to shock people into learning about inequality between women and men 

They then ask which is more offensive - the fact that they are swearing, or the facts that they are presenting you with. 

Each line of dialogue is expressed by a different girl, who are all dressed as Disney-style princesses, as they try to turn the “princess in distress” stereotype on its head. 

The video opens as it aims to go on - with a swear word seven seconds in. The MailOnline has bleeped out any of the words but has kept the rest of the video intact. 

The girls say: 'Pretty, pretty, What the f***? I’m not the pretty f***ing hopeless princess in distress

'I’m pretty f***ing powerful and ready for success.

'What is more offensive - a little girl saying f*** or the f***ing unequal and sexist way society treats girls and women?'

They continue: 'It’s our future, so listen up grown-ups.

'Here’s some words more offensive than the word f***.'

The first issue that the girls tackle is pay inequality, stating several eye-opening statistics about how unequal it is for women in the workplace. 

The girls say: 'Women are paid 22 per cent less than men for the exact same f***ing work.

'And women who graduate university with straight A’s get paid as much as men who only got C’s.

'So bad grades equal more bank, just because you’re a boy?

'Hell no mother f***er. I shouldn’t need a penis to get paid.'

The girls in the video ask which is more offensive - the fact that they are swearing, or the inequality facts that they are presenting you with 

They then move on to the topic of rape and violence against women and girls, opening with the figure: 'One out of every five women will be sexually assaulted or raped by a man.'

The girls then count that there are five of them in the video and ask, 'which one of us will it be?'

They continue: 'So how many more women have to get knocked down before society stands up and stops it?

'Stop telling girls how to dress and start telling boys not to f***ing rape.

'Equality’s next step is walking to the car without fear.' 

The girls then finish on the issue of looks and 'prettiness.' 

They say: 'Here’s the tricky thing, 'pretty' is a compliment, but here’s how this focus works to girls’ detriment.

The girls address a range of issues including pay inequality, rape, violence and body issues 

'Society teaching girls that our bodies, boobs and butts are more important than our brains, leads us to thinking that our worth comes from our waistline.

'My ass-pirations in life should not be worrying about the shape of my ass.

'So f*** focusing on how I look and give me a book.'

The video's producer Mike Kon acknowledges that some adults might be uncomfortable with what they see in the video, but insists that it is for a good cause. 

He said:'It is shocking what they are saying, but the real shock is that women are still paid less than men for the same work in 2014, not the use of the F-word.' 

Each line of dialogue is expressed by a different girl,who are all dressed as Disney-style princesses, as they try to turn the “princess in distress” stereotype on its head 

The girls are given witty but shocking one-liners that include: 'F*** focusing on how I look and give me a book'

Mike continued: 'The big statistic that one out of five women are sexually assaulted or raped is something society seems to find less offensive than a little four letter word and we love how these girls draw attention to that imbalance.' 

He added: 'Instead of washing these girls’ mouths out with soap, maybe society needs to clean up its act.' 

The video is part of the American FCKH8.com T-shirt company’s charity T-shirt fundraising effort.

The group’s website is making the tops available starting at $15 (£9.30), with $5 (£3.12) from each T-shirt sold going towards five anti-sexism organisations and projects.
