Losing a child is every mother's worst nightmare but Johanna Satekge knows all too well how it feels to watch helplessly as your baby dies in your arms.

Diagnosed with HIV two months into her first pregnancy, the 39-year-old, from South Africa's Limpopo province, lost her eldest two children from complications caused by the disease.

The reason? She was too afraid to admit to having HIV and was unable to access the drugs she needed to stop the disease from passing to her children.

Brave: Johanna Satekge, 39, from South Africa's Limpopo province, was diagnosed with HIV in 2000

Tragedy: Johanna lost two of her babies to HIV before getting antiretroviral drugs

But six years on from the death of her second child, Johanna is a happy mother of two healthy children and is now a health worker who spends her time educating others about the risks of HIV.

'I am very healthy now,' she explains, smilingly. 'I live a healthy lifestyle, look after myself and have been on anti-retrovirals for nearly a decade.

'My experiences are what makes me the person I am today. I have been through it all and have lived to tell the tale.'

And Johanna really has been through it all. Healthy and well throughout her childhood and teens, her life was turned upside down when she was brutally attacked and raped aged 21.

Although she didn't know it, her attacker was HIV positive and it was to be another four years before Johanna realised that she too had the virus.

Growing up, she knew little about the disease beyond that it meant 'death and dying'. 'We knew that anyone who had AIDS was a walking grave,' she says.

'All the photos we saw on TV and in magazines were of bone thin people whom you could tell were on their deathbed.

'I didn't know anything except that it was a prostitute disease,' she continues. 'Any woman who was HIV-positive was regarded as promiscuous. 

'Even our pastors called it a punishment from God for promiscuity.'

Despite official denials, 1990s South Africa was at the centre of a growing AIDS epidemic - made worse by then president Thabo Mbeki's refusal to admit that it existed.

As a result, while new infections dropped in countries like Uganda, where the government swiftly moved to counter AIDS and educate those at risk, the number of South African infections multiplied rapidly.

Among them was Johanna, although with no knowledge of the disease and no idea what symptoms to look for, it wasn't until 2000 that the terrible truth was revealed.

Pregnant with her first child, Johanna says she was 'so happy' until a routine blood test two months in revealed that she was HIV positive.

Overwhelmed with shame and living in a community that stigmatised those with the condition, she kept it secret. 

'The stigma at that time was very high and there was very little care in the clinics. 'Everyone was scared - especially in the rural areas.

'Most people with HIV would commit suicide just so they didn't have to experience all the sickness,' she continues.

'If our government had taken HIV seriously then, there would not have been so much death.'

Just 14 months after Johanna's diagnosis and seven months after he was born, her son became the first person in her family to fall victim to AIDS. 

'When I gave birth to a healthy baby who was not sick, I decided that I would breastfeed him myself,' she says.

'But he started getting sick at four months. I carried on, hoping he would be fine, but my baby died in my arms at seven months.

Disbelief: Former South African president Thabo Mbeki (left) refused to believe that AIDS exists while Jacob Zuma thinks a shower will protect you. As a result, AIDS has reached epidemic levels in South Africa

Programme: One leader who did respond to the crisis was Uganda's Yoweri Museveni. Cases of AIDS in his country are now falling rapidly

'Judging by how sick he was, I knew it could only be AIDS. Losing my child was not easy, I nearly died of heartache. I cried so much that I thought I would follow him.'

The death of her son gave Johanna the impetus she needed to finally seek help and in 2002, she plucked up the courage to finally tell her friends and family.

'I decided not to be silent anymore,' she says. 'It was time for someone to do something and who else if not me.'

She threw herself into efforts to help other HIV positive women, working with AIDS charity Mothers2Mothers to help educate rural communities.

But tragedy struck again two years later when Johanna became pregnant with her second child but once more, lost her to HIV shortly after birth. 

'I got a single dose of Nevirapine [an anti-AIDS drug] and so did my baby but that was not enough,' she remembers.

'I was given one pill to take during labour but it was not enough to save her. We did get the treatment but we were among the unlucky. 

'My daughter Lehlogonolo was born healthy but I soon realised that she was not growing, she was not gaining weight.'

Worried, she tried to have the little girl tested but was told that the baby was too young to take a HIV test.

Unwilling to give up, she asked a colleague to do a CD4 cell count - which can indicate the presence of the disease - and her worst fears were confirmed.

'She was found to be HIV positive,' says Johanna sadly. 'But by the time she was started on antiretroviral drugs, it was already too late for her. She passed on two weeks later.'

A heartbroken Johanna was once more plunged into a morass of grief and recrimination. 'My child got infected and I blamed myself every day for that,' she says.

Tragic: Although South Africa is making progress, for many HIV sufferers, action has come too late

Speaking out: Johanna hopes that more people will now speak out and wants to banish the stigma of HIV

'I hated that I tried to have a child again only to experience another death. I was angry and sad all the time.'

Devastated by the loss of her second child, Johanna vowed never to get pregnant again but changed her mind after finally being given access to antiretroviral drugs.

Less than a year after beginning the course of medication, her viral load was so low it was virtually undetectable and later that year, her son Lefa was born - healthy and HIV negative.

Four years later, a second healthy child, a daughter named Tiisetso followed and Johanna says that she couldn't be happier.

'I now have two HIV negative children and I believe I am the richest woman in the world.'

Currently, 600 HIV positive babies are born every single day in sub-Saharan Africa, with many of the victims hailing from Johanna's native South Africa.

She now works as a mentor mother for charity mothers2mothers, which employs HIV positive women and sends them to work alongside doctors and nurses in understaffed health centres as members of the healthcare team. 

In one-on-one and group sessions, mentor mothers provide health education and psycho-social support to other HIV-positive mothers, as well as providing them with the wherewithal to protect their babies from HIV infection, and keep themselves and their families healthy.
