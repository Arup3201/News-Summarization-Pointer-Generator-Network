Google’s Street View project has mapped the landmarks of Venice, the interiors of train stations and even the Large Hadron Collider.

But now anyone can document views of their favourite locations, which might not have been visited by Google’s cameras.

Members of the public can use an Android smartphone or camera to take photographs and transform them into 'photo spheres' using ‘Views’, which is a new feature of Google Maps.

Here, 'photo spheres' are connected to create a 360º view of Dunluce Castle. Using the new service, photo spheres can be added to Google Maps and shared with people around the world

Users must visit 'Views' and open their profile page.

They then manually select the photos they wish to connect to make a sphere of a 360º view.

A map of the images is created with photo spheres marked in blue, sequentially with letters.

To choose the location of a new photo sphere, users drag a dot to their chosen place and rotate them so landmarks or specific markers are facing in the right direction.

Photo spheres can be linked to others so that visitors to the site can jump between similar spheres.

The idea is that users connect images together to create photo spheres - 360º views of a chosen location - which can then be added to Google Maps and shared with people around the world.

To create a photo sphere, users can take a series of photos using an android smartphone or DSLR camera and upload them to Views.

There is no need for a ‘Trekker’ backpack or special car, which are both used by Google in its Street View mapping project.

They then connect photos together on a map to create photo spheres, which when generated can be navigated by anyone using Google Maps, in a similar way to Street View.

Evan Rapoport, Product Manager, Google Maps and Photo Sphere wrote in a blog: ‘We are excited to see the different types of Street View experiences that everyone will contribute.’

He believes the feature could be used to allow environmental charitable organisations to document and promote the beautiful places they strive to protect.

‘It also opens up a new tool for photographers to showcase diversity in a specific location - by times of day, weather conditions or cultural events - in a way that Street View currently doesn’t cover,’ he said.

Google also suggests that the new tool could also be used by businesses to show people what it is like inside their office or factory.

‘Whether you’re photographing exotic islands or your favourite neighbourhood hangout, mountain peaks or city streets, historic castles or your own business, we’re thrilled to see the places you love coming to life on Google Maps,’ Mr Rapoport said.
