A woman has told of how a failure to recognize her own overweight body in a photo motivated her to shed 80lbs.

Victoria Elizabeth, a 29-year-old from Orlando, Florida, told MailOnline that a rapid maturation during puberty combined with comfort eating to cope with bullying led to her weight-gain during high school.

But one day, when she glimpsed her 214lb self wearing a backpack in a picture taken by a classmate, 'I was horrified. I had no idea that I was wider than my overstuffed red bag,' she said.

Fat to fabulous: Victoria Elizabeth, a 29-year-old from Orlando, has told how she was shocked by a high school picture of herself (left) into shedding 80lbs from her 214lb frame

'It
was a hard reality to accept. This was not me,' said the five-foot-two aspiring writer. 'I was a bubbly, 
energetic person. How could such an enthusiastic person be buried inside
someone so large?'

Calling this moment her biggest 
breaking point, Victoria describes how seeing her 'two chins' and realizing 'my arms were thicker than the thighs of most girls my age' motivated her lose weight.

'And that's really when it clicked that I needed to do something,' she explains.

After skipping meals, with no avail, the then-16-year-old was enrolled in Navy Junior Reserves Officer Training Corps, which saw her running and doing calisthenics every morning.

'When 20 students depend on you to keep doing your pushups to avoid punishment, it's amazing how much willpower you can find buried inside you,' she explains in a piece on Huffington Post.

Thanks to the high-octane exercise class, Victoria says she lost 44lbs by the end of high school, and a double shift as a waitress in college led her to shed even more weight.

'I was bubbly. How could such an enthusiastic person be buried inside
someone so large?'

What's more, not having enough money 
in college to afford 'luxury' foods forced her to stick to bare basics 
like lean meats and frozen vegetables.

Though she ultimately dropped to a healthy 134lbs, Victoria says it's still a battle to maintain her weight, which she writes about on her blog, Memoirs of a Yo-Yo Dieter.

'I struggle to still maintain my healthy weight and fitness patterns,' she told MailOnline, adding that she is currently trying to establish a career as a freelance fitness and nutrition journalist.Â 

After: Now, Victoria follows a mostly Paleo diet - which sees her avoiding grains, beans and dairy - but says the key to her healthy lifestyle is the occasional indulgence

'Fortunately, I have more good days than bad as I have established fitness habits and a regimen that help keep me on track.'

The regimen involves a mostly Paleo diet - also known as the caveman diet - which sees her avoiding grains, beans and dairy.

But Victoria says the real key to her healthy lifestyle is the occasional indulgence.

'I'm human,' she says. 'So I stick with my diet 90per cent of the time and will have the occasional cheat, such as a pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks or a few Reese's peanut butter cups.

'We always want what we can't have,' she explains, advising others: 'Don't restrict - improvise!'
