Congressman Sean Duffy was assaulted by someone in Washington on Wednesday, according to his office.

The Wisconsin Republican said a stranger screamed at him and grabbed him as he walked to the Capitol to vote on legislation.

Duffy reported the incident to police as required by U.S. House security procedures but asked for no further action, his office said.

Duffy has been a vocal advocate for delaying the rollout of the federal health care law.

Duffy's spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a message asking whether the incident was related to the government shutdown.

A professional lumberjack who appeared on MTV's 'The Real World: Boston' in the late 1990s, Duffy voted for legislation that would have avoided a government shutdown but halted the implementation of the federal health care law.

When some GOP leaders appeared resigned to the law going into effect, Duffy tweeted that they 'refuse to fight. Wave white flag and surrender.'

Duffy, who was first elected in 2010, represents a sprawling district that covers mostly rural northwestern Wisconsin. He was a former cast member of the 'The Real World'

He has since said that he did not want the federal government to close but he felt a compromise wasn't in the nation's long-term interest.

U.S. Capitol Police confirmed the agency was investigating an assault on a member of Congress but did not provide details.
