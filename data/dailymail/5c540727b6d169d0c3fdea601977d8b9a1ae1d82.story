Despite a grand total of 88 years on the planet, Sir David Attenborough is showing no desire to slow down. Ever passionate and curious about the natural world, it seems there's always more to explore. 

'I'm moving much slower than I used to,' the 88-year-old admits, with a smile, speaking exclusively to Mail Online, 'but I've still got a lot to give, and 2015 is as big a year as I can remember.'

As 2015 begins, Attenborough is, at first, in reflective mood. The last 12 months have seen him wrap up the BBC's landmark series, Life Story, which engaged the nation in a storytelling version of relationships in the wild.

The 88-year-old is still as curious as ever about the natural world and is showing no sign of slowing down. Here he holds a tiny midwife toad, native to Europe and northwestern Africa, in the palm of his hand

He's also shot specials for the BBC – Attenborough's Birds of Paradise and Attenborough's Big Birds – attracting new audiences by embracing 3D technology.

The documentaries mark the latest contribution in a six-decade career that taken him from the British Isles to the depths of the rainforest and beyond. 

It was in 1954, as BBC2 controller filling in on Zoo Quest, that he stepped onto his first international flight, acting as no more than a stand-in for regular presenter Jack Lester. And the rest, as they say, is history. 

This year has started with a flutter of press engagements. He has the promotion for two new series, associated DVD releases, charity and ambassadorial commitments, not to mention the sketching out of research plans and narratives for the next burst of natural world programming at the end of 2015.

But Attenborough explains that when you get to his age, you're inclined to turn away from any drawn-out plans. 'You simply take it day by day,' he admits. 'Right now, we've got a series in Patagonia that is taking up much of my attention. 

'That will keep me going until the summer. It's all about dinosaurs and fossils – that's subject matter you can research until you go mad, should you wish to. It's endless.

'For me it's about enjoying each challenge. I love being busy and love feeling as though I've still got a part to play. I'd never want to stand in the way of someone else coming in and suggesting they take on a few of these projects if they think they can do them better. 

'But I keep getting asked to do them, so how would I ever turn such opportunities down? I love the excitement that travel provides – every trip feels like a new adventure… I think that's why we all love travel.'

Attenborough is in good shape for his age. His health is the end result of a professional career spent in the great outdoors. 

He's challenged himself physically over the years – no more so than recently after undergoing heart and knee surgery – yet still comes across as largely invincible. But it turns out he's as flappable as the rest of us.

'I'm terrified of so many things. I'm more likely to get vertigo than in my teens when I was a very enthusiastic and silly rock climber.' 

Attenborough loves being busy and hates to turn down an opportunity to go on another adventure, but he is concerned that human population growth is having a detrimental effect on animal species

You'd think imbalance and a fear of heights is illogical for a man who has clambered his fair share of mountains. 

He agrees: 'I ought to be used to it, but when you're hanging 300ft up for an hour or so it's nice to come down.'

Sir David gets to see the majesty of the natural world from dizzying heights, but also takes a microscopic look at intricate ecosystems and their inhabitants.

In his years, he's seen species decline and come back, ecosystems rejuvenate and destroy themselves, opening up viewers' awareness to conservation issues they never knew existed. Through all this, his views on climate change have solidified.

'The facts are indisputable that the climate is changing,' he says once again. 'And human beings are the cause of it? Of course. It is an undisputable fact. Population growth is detrimental to the planet. End of.

'Having just come back from the Great Barrier Reef, in that place there exists the perfect example of the damage. All the statistics are there. The temperature of the sea is changing, as is its acidity. 

'You can see the sea grass visibly changing and the coral are unable to live in these higher temperatures. They won't be able to form coral limestone anymore. You don't need to be a genius to see that.'

In his career Attenborough has seen ecosystems rise and fall, and animal species decline then resurface. In his Natural Curiosities series, Attenborough looked at the platypus, which was discovered in the 19th century just before Darwin published his Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection

As well as looking at ecosystems from great heights, Sir David has always enjoyed taking a close-up look at their inhabitants. Why certain species have the patterns they do  has intrigued him for years, and in Natural Curiosities he looks into the similarities between the striped markings of the zebra and the morpho butterfly

Sir David predicts that this year travellers will start to appreciate places they find closer to home

ONE: We'll keep on travelling, but we're beginning to appreciate places closer to home that perhaps we may have ignored 10 years ago.

TWO: Eco-tourism is set for a big year. Despite conservation challenges there is clearly a growing trend towards green travel experiences.

THREE: Technology is going to take travel to another level. My fear though is we're so obsessed with tour guide apps we actually miss what's in front of us!

FOUR: If operator margins are being squeezed, the travel experience is in danger of becoming a sales operation. If you are on safari, you should be allowed to be on safari, not sold to at every turn.

FIVE: People will continue to want to explore more off the beaten track. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing for our wildlife, to be honest.

And on dry land the challenges come just as frequently. 'My job always come back to the animals - I go where they are, not where they aren't. 

'But even there the situation is changing. I went to see the deforestation in Borneo recently and, honestly, it hit me hard. 

'Because of the need for grazing and land required for the production of palm oil, the natural landscape is being ripped apart. And all this demand is coming from the needs of the global population.'  

So if mankind's degradation of rainforest environments continues despite huge campaigns of awareness over the past generation, what is the answer? 

'The only way we can implement any change to the damage caused to the natural world is by controlling the continued explosion of the human population,' says the broadcaster. 

'The Chinese population has benefited from their 'one child' policy - they would be in even greater trouble than they are at the moment if they hadn't been doing that for the past 20 years. 

'But the answer is much greater than that, and actually, the right to have children is a fundamental right as a human being.

'The reality is, if we cannot control our yearning to reproduce, eco-tourism might be the only answer we have left in trying to, even partially, arrest this slump in green thinking. 

'There are some fantastic initiatives in this area – India, Kenya, Uganda, and even in the UK with some awe-inspiring walking holidays in Scotland and Ireland. 

'People needn't think eco-tourism means travelling to far-off lands or protecting obscure species we've never previously heard of. 

'The reality is protecting the environment can begin from the moment we leave the house.'
