The thought of it has never been far from Scottish minds since the draw was made in Nice in February.

Facing Germany at any stage of a qualifying campaign is always a cause for concern but on the  evidence of what transpired in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, our date with Joachim Low’s side in  Dortmund on September 7 suddenly has all the appeal of being tied to a railway track.

Scotland still has good reason for approaching the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with a degree of cautious optimism, however.

The Scottish FA tweeted: Just a quick reminder that our first Euro 2016 qualifier is Germany in Dortmund in September. Good. #naeborra

The past year under Gordon  Strachan has been characterised by markedly better organisation, spirit and results. Defeating Croatia home and away is the hallmark of a side on the rise.

In a section also containing  Ireland, Poland, Georgia and Gibraltar, there are sound grounds for believing that our soon-to-be  18-year exile from international competition may soon be over.

Yet ensuring the outlook remains as positive by the time we exit the Westfalenstadion in just eight weeks’ time is a tall order.

Whether Germany have claimed a fourth World Cup by then or not, the ruthless manner of their  historic 7-1 win over Brazil was enough to send a shiver down the neck of every Scot.

Here Sportsmail takes an in-depth look at the formidable barrier facing Strachan’s side when our campaign gets underway.

THE GOALKEEPER

Manuel Neuer’s displays for both club and country over the past five seasons have instigated a  moratorium on the debate over the greatest goalkeeper on the planet. There is simply none to be had.

He would probably be out on his own were his talents to stretch no further than his shot-stopping  ability — as evidenced by the  concrete fist that repelled France’s Karim Benzema in the quarter-final. That’s only one of the strings on his bow, however.

Neuer’s ability to turn defence into attack with his precision kicks and throws is one of Germany’s most potent weapons. Just look at the way the likes of Andre Schurrle glides on to his heat-seeking missiles.

Yet Neuer isn’t one to wait patiently in his goalmouth for the ball to come to him. The ‘Sweeper Keeper’, as he’s become known, is happy with the ball at his feet  outside his box, thus letting his defence play a high line. A high-risk — but highly productive — strategy.

He’s a fearsome character, too. Note his disgust when Oscar scored the most meaningless consolation in history or how his enormous frame fills the goal before a penalty kick.

THE BACK FOUR

Low has played either 4-3-3 or  4-2-3-1 throughout the competition, with only the personnel in the  rearguard changing. Philipp Lahm started in the holding midfield role but has reverted to right-back.

That has allowed Jerome Boateng to step inside one position to  partner Mats Hummels, meaning there’s been no need to expose Per Mertesacker’s lack of pace.

Benedict Howedes, the Schalke left-back, has been a constant.

Irrespective of who is playing ahead of them, the defensive unit have no requirement to force the game. There’s enough flare and invention in the six men further up the field to win the game.Neuer’s uncanny ability to play effectively as an 11th outfield player at times — Low stated last week that he could comfortably play in midfield — naturally pushes his defenders higher up the pitch.

THE MIDFIELD

Low normally operates with one holding player, so take your pick between multiple Champions League winners Lahm or Schweinsteiger. And, were his squad to be floored by some kind of plague, he could always turn to one of the Bender twins, Sven or Lars, who ply their trades for Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen respectively.

And, for the record, neither made the cut for Brazil.

Just ahead of the ‘pivot’, Low deploys two narrow attacking  midfielders, Bastian Schweinsteiger — if he’s not required to hold — Toni Kroos and/or Sami Khedira.

The three are almost joined at the hip at times, tag-teaming whenever there’s a growing crisis, but largely dominating possession, pressing and feeding the front three.

As Brazil found to their cost, it’s all one and two touch, the ball being flashed around like it’s  following a laser. Just try to  disrupt that rhythm.

THE STRIKEFORCE

So much for the death of the  traditional No 9. Low is still a big believer in having a penalty-box striker at the arrow’s head and there are few better in world  football than record-breaking  Miroslav Klose.

At 36, the Scots might just have seen the back of the Lazio man. He’ll take 71 goals with him into international retirement, even if he doesn’t score in Sunday’s final.

Thomas Muller led the front line pretty well earlier in the campaign and is likely to revert there come September.

The supporting cast isn’t too bad either. Mesut Ozil may have faded badly for Arsenal after a great start but his ability either coming in off the right or in the traditional No 10 role is beyond question.

His team-mate Lukas Podolski, a veteran of six tournaments at just 29, remains both a prolific  provider and scorer of goals, while Bayern Munich’s Mario Gotze and  Chelsea’s Schurrle are indicative of a squad with seemingly  boundless depth.

The fact Germany have got this far without the injured Marco Reus — Germany’s best attacking player according to Dietmar Hamann — is ominous.

REALISTICALLY, WHAT CHANCE DO SCOTLAND HAVE?

Pretty slim, but then that’s how we felt when the draw was made. It’s a shot to nothing.

A point on the opening night would be a godsend but, if that’s beyond us, a positive performance against a nation that’s truly arrived would be the next best thing.

No one should lose sight of the bigger picture. The Germans were always going to be white-hot favourites to win the group, with Scotland, Ireland and Poland scrapping for the other automatic spot behind them — and if that’s not to be, then third, which goes into a play-off.

Irrespective of whether Germany win the World Cup or not on  Sunday, they’ll be expected to go through the section with ease.

As when we had Spain for  company in the 2012 qualifiers, it won’t be our two games with them that will shape our qualification fate. It will be four matches with our direct rivals and any slip-ups against Georgia or, heaven forbid, Gibraltar.

If we need inspiration, cite the case of Lithuania, who travelled to Italy in 2006 supposedly as lambs to the slaughter as the recently crowned world champions paraded the trophy. The result? A score draw.

Strachan has also shown himself to be a shrewd tactician. You don’t win in Croatia, Macedonia and Poland unless you can contain opponents without loading the sandbags.

Yet, even before Scott Brown sustained an injury that’s likely to rule him out, September 7 was always likely to prove the toughest test of Strachan’s credentials.

Come what may, we will surely be able to reflect that we did better than the Brazilians. That’s a given, right?
