Andrew Meldrum: The 30-year-old used specialist computer software to spy on girls undressing

A pervert installed spy software on women’s computers so he could watch them undress.

IT expert Andrew Meldrum, 30, posed as a helpful friend who would fix their laptops.

But the university student abused their trust so he could stealthily watch them during their most intimate moments.

Police discovered he amassed more than 11,000 pictures of his two victims, many of them naked, after secretly taking control of their computers.

Yesterday, a judge said he was sure the ‘Peeping Tom’ was acting solely to feed his own ‘sexual gratification’.

But he allowed him to walk free from court after handing him a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. It is believed to be the first time anyone in the UK has been convicted of abusing webcams to spy on others in this way.

The case echoes the spying activities of GCHQ, which was revealed earlier this year to have accessed the cameras and microphones of computers without the owners’ permission.

Meldrum’s twisted activities were uncovered when one of his two young female victims realised something was wrong with her computer. In a panic, Meldrum immediately sent her a text saying, ‘Please don’t call the police’.

But she did and investigators discovered he had planted a specialist program on their laptops while pretending to fix other problems.

It allowed him to watch them around the clock from the comfort of his home via the computers’ webcams without their knowledge.

He even persuaded one of the women to keep the laptop at the end of her bed so it was in a ‘better position for watching movies’. In fact it gave him a prime spot for watching her being intimate with her boyfriend, Woolwich Crown Court was told.

The women were horrified when police showed them intimate photos of themselves in front of their bedroom mirrors, often naked or in their underwear.

In one case the software had been installed for 15 months and was set up to take a photograph every two seconds and transmit it to Meldrum.

Twisted: Meldrum's software allowed him to watch his victims round the clock

Prosecutor James Vine said: ‘If you asked most people what a voyeur was, they’d probably tell you it was another word for Peeping Tom. They would be right.

‘That is exactly what this case is about, albeit a very modern version for the technological age. Andrew Meldrum does not peep through keyholes or curtains. He is rather more sophisticated than that.’

The two victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, tearfully comforted one another as he was sentenced yesterday.

Recorder Mark Heywood said Meldrum ‘surreptitiously’ installed the software which even allowed him to watch the women on his mobile phone.

He told Meldrum he ‘abused these people’s trust and confidence’.

Shila Whitehead, defending Meldrum, said he had lost his job in IT and a place at Goldsmiths University as a result of his crimes.

She added: ‘He is extremely remorseful and he accepts he violated their privacy. He previously turned to gambling and alcohol and has huge debts.’

Meldrum, of Lewisham, South-East London, was convicted of two counts of voyeurism by a jury and admitted a further three counts of unauthorised computer access.

He was told he will be supervised for two years and must undergo 20 sessions aimed at addressing his behaviour.

He was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for ten years, pay £2,100 in costs and told he cannot use a computer unless it monitors his activities.

One of the victims told ITV news: ‘It makes you question your trust in people. And makes you question how you live your daily life, and what you do in your home daily, knowing that someone is constantly watching you.’

When asked about the breach of trust she had experienced, she said: ‘It’s just quite difficult really to know who to trust.’
