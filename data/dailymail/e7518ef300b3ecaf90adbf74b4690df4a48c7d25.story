With new statistics showing that men in London are being paid 13.2 per cent more than their female counterparts, it's not surprising that working women are feeling hard done by.

In fact a huge 44 per cent of women believe their gender has hindered their careers, or will in the future, according to a new survey.

And though Cameron’s latest parade of female cabinet members speaks of a change of attitudes towards women in traditionally “male” working environments, 12 per cent of women do not believe their employer values men and equally, no matter what their level.

Fighting against the glass ceiling: Men in the City earn 13.2 per cent more than women (posed by models)

A survey by Talking Talent, a consultancy firm working to inspire working women, hinted that workplace sexism is keeping women out of top roles, with 12 per cent of women saying they have been passed over for promotion because of their sex.

For every pound men earned in 2013, women received 
only 86.8p – down from 89.1p in 2012 – making it unsurprising that 
over a third of women say they have experienced workplace prejudice.

And across the UK, for every male pound the average earning for women is 80p, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics obtained by Labour.

Experts believe the gap is due to men being awarded bigger bonuses - approximately £6,442 for men in management roles compared with £3,029 for women, according to the Fawcett Society - while women are relegated into part-time jobs with lower pay.

Shadow women's minister Gloria De Piero told the Evening Standard 'Whether you’re a chief executive or hairdresser, women across the capital are being paid less than men for doing the same or equivalent work.

Making it a priority: Shadow women's minister Gloria De Piero

'There are some great examples of companies that are leading the way in efforts to close the gap but delivering equal pay should be a priority for all employers.'

Though it’s not all bad news, with 80 per cent of women saying they feel their employer is supportive of them, there’s no denying that there’s a long way to go before there’s total gender equality in the workplace.

Law, education and accountancy seem to be the career areas that women feel most supported in, with working mothers saying that employers in these industries are particularly supportive.

Of these sectors accountancy tops the list as the best area for working women, receiving the highest scores for positive behaviour towards women by employers.

On the flip side, working women have named the advertising, media, engineering and construction industries as the worst sectors to work in.

For working mothers in particular, your career – like your children – can sometimes present a paradox, as the results of the survey show.

With a third of employers  offering careers breaks for women to have a child, and 14 per cent offering subsidised childcare, just over seventy per cent of working mothers say their employer is supportive.

But unfortunately, as the gender pay gap demonstrates, it’s not all rosy for women who want to have a career and children.

Just get on with it! Dame Stephanie Shirley thinks women should stop complaining about the 'glass ceiling'

A third of women have experienced workplace prejudice or discrimination because they were a mother, while 37 per cent said being a working mother has hindered their career, including being passed over for promotion.

However, while the government continues to strive for equality in the workplace, some female business leaders say it’s time that women stopped moaning about the glass ceiling and just got on with it.

Dame Stephanie Shirley, 80, who launched her own IT services company, Xansa, in 1962, says that women today don’t know how good they’ve got it.

In her recent Daily Mail article she wrote ‘If only aggrieved women knew what I had to put up with just a generation before, they might moan less and, instead, focus on the giddy heights now firmly within their grasp.

'Believe me, women today would baulk at some of the blatant, institutionalised sexism that not only existed, but was actively encouraged [50 years ago].’
