Quitting: Royal British Legion chief Sir John Kiszely is embroiled in the 'top brass for hire' scandal

More than 3,500 senior military staff have taken up jobs in arms firms over the past 16 years, it emerged last night.

The figures, published after of the ‘generals for hire’ scandal, highlight the extent of the revolving door between the Armed Forces and the private sector.

The data suggests hundreds of senior officers and Whitehall figures are being given jobs by arms firms every year.

Some 231 jobs went to former officials and military personnel in 2011/12, and 101 were hired the year before.

In total 3,572 jobs have been approved under Ministry of Defence rules since 1996, according to the Guardian.

It comes after six former senior military officers were secretly filmed boasting of their influence over ministers and officials, claiming they could help set up lucrative deals for arms firms.

The MoD yesterday began its own inquiry into the scandal.

Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely, one of those caught on camera by the Sunday Times, has resigned from his role as president of the Royal British Legion over the scandal.

In his resignation letter, he admitted he had made ‘exaggerated and foolish claims’, but denied any impropriety.

Admiral Trevor Soar, until this year commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy, has also quit his role as an adviser at British defence company Babcock. The firm said Sir John had also been dismissed from his role at the firm.

Others caught in the Sunday Times sting include former MoD procurement chief Lt Gen Richard Applegate, ex-Army chief General Lord Dannatt, Lord Stirrup, ex-head of the Armed Forces, and General Sir Mike Jackson, also a former head of the Army.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘We are currently considering issues in relation to business appointment rules.’
