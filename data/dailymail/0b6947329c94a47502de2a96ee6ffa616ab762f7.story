Women in Sweden can expect to earn 250,000 euros less than their male colleagues, over the course of their careers.

And to highlight the global issue of gender equality in the workplace, the chairwoman of the Scandinavian nation's largest union decided to undergo a dramatic transformation.

Annelie Nordstrom, chair of Kommunal, was given the drastic makeover, which sees her evolve into a man, thanks to clever makeup, a new wardrobe and a wig.

How to get a pay rise in seconds: Annelie Nordstrom, chairwoman of Sweden's largest union, underwent a radical transformation to highlight the issue of gender equality in the workplace

Unrecognisable: Ms Nordstrom as a man. The stunt was designed to show the only way a woman can expect to be paid more faster is to dress as a man

But the fun stunt - The Easiest Way To Get A Raise: Be A Man - was designed to come with a hard-hitting message.

Agency Volontaire, who came up with the idea, said it was designed to show the best way for a woman to get equal pay faster.

At the current pace it will take more than a century for women's salaries in Sweden to equal that of men.

According to some studies, women in the U.S. are still paid just 77 cents for every dollar their male colleagues make.

Meanwhile just 4.2 per cent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women.

Point: Ms Nordstrom took part after it emerged women in Sweden can expect to be paid 250,000 euros less than their male colleagues over the course of their career

Clever trick: With the help of some clever makeup, a wig and a man's suit, Ms Nordstrom was transformed into a male version of herself

Long struggle: At the current pace it will take more than a century for women's salaries in Sweden to equal that of men
