A former stockbroker nicknamed 'Britain's Schindler' after saving hundreds of Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Prague was today awarded the Czech Republic's highest honour at the age of 105.

Sir Nicholas Winton rescued more than 650 refugee children from certain death in concentration camps by transporting them to the UK on trains and finding them foster families.

He received the Order of the White Lion from Czech president Milos Zeman, who had previously described him as 'an example of humanity, selflessness, personal courage and modesty'.

In a speech in front of some of the people he saved, Sir Nicholas said: 'Thank you all for this enormous expression of thanks for something which happened to me nearly 100 years ago - and 100 years is a heck of a long time.

'I am delighted that so many of the children are still here to thank me.'

He went on to praise the families who gave the children homes after they arrived in Britain.

'I thank the British people for making room for them to accept them,' he said.

'And of course the enormous help given by so many of the Czechs who were at that time doing what they could to fight the Germans and get the children out.' 

His son Nick, granddaughter Holly, grandson Laurence, daughter Barbara and her husband Steve were also in attendance.

Sir Nicholas defied the wishes of his family by flying to the ceremony in a special plane provided by the Czech Defence Ministry after they expressed fears for his health.

His friend Matej Minac, the director of several programmes and a film about Sir Nicholas, said: 'He has done what he wanted all his life so it's no surprise he defied his worried family to come. 

'He loved travelling and he would like to travel although he is 105. His family prohibits him to travel because of his age and health. 

'Sir Nicholas says it is better if he died in Prague where he could enjoy himself and have some fun than to live in England and be bored to death.

'I think that the invitation to Prague may extend his life. He loves adventures and this is an adventure for him.'  

Speaking ahead of the award ceremony at Prague Castle, Sir Nicholas said he felt proud to have 'made a difference to a lot of people'.

'I knew better than most, and certainly better than the politicians, what was going on in Germany,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.

'The first thing to know is that if something is not impossible there must be a way of doing it.'

It was late in December 1938 when Sir Nicholas from Hampstead, then a stockbroker, cancelled a holiday and instead went to Prague to see for himself the plight of child refugees. 

Horrified by the treatment of the Jews under the Nazi occupation, he set about organising eight evacuations of the threatened children on the Czech 'Kindertransport' train.  

He advertised in newspapers for foster homes, organised residency permits from the immigration office in the UK, and persuaded the Germans to let the children go. 

He said: 'Once we got the machinery in place, it was purely up to me to get in touch with all kinds of organisations throughout the country whether they would take a child.

'That was not an unusual thing to do because it was at the time when the people here ourselves were moving people from the South and the North because of safety'.

He did not tell anyone about his remarkable achievements for some 50 years, until his wife found a scrapbook. 

The story came to the public's attention when, in 1988, he was invited to appear in the audience of BBC programme That's Life. 

During the episode the audience was asked if Sir Nicholas had helped anyone, at which point two dozen people stood up and applauded him.

He said yesterday there was 'no personal fear involved' despite dealing with the Nazis and believes the world is a far more dangerous place today. 

Asked about conflicts around the world today, he said: 'We've made a mess of it'

'I don't think we ever learn from the mistakes from the past. The world today is a more dangerous situation than it has ever been.

'So as long as you've got the weapons of mass destruction which can finish off any conflict, nothing is safe any more.'

Taking into the account the children of those he saved, there are estimated to be around 6,000 people in the world today who owe him their lives. 

He was knighted by the Queen in 2003.  

To this day, they call themselves 'Nicky's children'.

Sir Nicholas celebrated his 105th birthday earlier this year at the Czech embassy in London where most of the guests were the offspring of the children rescued by him.

At his birthday party, he said: 'I am always surprised every time I come here to see all kinds of people who have come really very great distances to say hello.

'As far as I am concerned, it is only Anno Domini that I am fighting - I am not ill, I am just old and doddery.'

Sir Nicholas still lives in his own home in Berkshire, with only a day carer.
