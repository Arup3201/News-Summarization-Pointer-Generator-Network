Michael Brown Sr. has released a public service announcement shortly before the grand jury decision on whether or not to indict the police officer who shot dead his son, Michael Brown.

In it, he appeals for calm and non-violence among those who might protest, saying that 'hurting others is not the answer.'

He also takes a moment to thank many of the protesters for 'lifting [their] voices to end racial profiling and police intimidation.'

This as Darren Wilson, the officer responsible for the fatal shooting, has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department.

Fate: The grand jury will decide whether or not to charge Officer Darren Wilson (above) in the death of Michael Brown, though Wilson feels confident he won't be found guilty says a source

Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met Thursday with Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the shooting.

'It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,' Roorda said.

Meanwhile, Wilson may announce as early as Friday his plans to resign from the force, as a way of protecting fellow officers and easing pressures in the wake of the shooting. 

Regardless of what happens though, Brown is trying to keep things calm.

'No matter what the grand jury decides, I do not want my son’s death to be in vain,' says Brown.

'I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone. 

Brown does make it clear however, that there is still more work to be done.

'Continue to lift your voices with us and lets work together to heal and to create lasting change for all people regardless of race,' he says. 

This as the FBI has warned law enforcement agencies across the country that the grand jury verdict in this case 'will likely' lead to violence.

The grand jury decision is expected to come this month.

Meanwhile, Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency in Missouri and activated the National Guard, citing the 'possibility of expanded unrest.'

The state of emergency will last 30 days unless extended by another order.

His side: Wilson, labeled a cop killer by many protesters (above), says Brown punched him in the face and tried to wrestle his gun away on August 9 before he shot at the teenager

No doubt fueling many of these fears of unrest are reports like the one that came out on Tuesday claiming that Ferguson's own cops and their supporters were urging people to go out and get guns on online message boards.

'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family,' said one commentor on the forum St Louis Cop Talk.

Then there is the report that a militant group is offering a cash reward for anyone who can give them the location of Willson.

A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer's whereabouts.

Brown was shot by Wilson on August 9 in Ferguson.

Wilson allegedly claimed, according to his grand jury testimony which was leaked to the public, that he saw Brown and his friend Don Johnson walking down the middle of the road that day, and thought Brown matched the description of a young man involved in a recent robbery.

When he tried to stop the boys, he said Brown punched him through the window.

Making themselves heard: Protesters on both sides of the argument feel very strongly, leading the FBI to warn that the grand jury verdict in this case 'will likely' lead to violence

Wilson claims he then drew his weapon but Brown tried to wrestle it from him while continuing to punch him in the face.

During that struggle for his gun, Wilson said he got off two shots, missing the Brown on the first and hitting him in the hand with the second.

When Brown tried to escape, Wilson allegedly stated that he continued to shoot, firing off the fatal volley of shots when Brown turned and started rushing towards him.

This account is in stark contrast with that of several eye witnesses, and Brown's companion Johnson, who have claimed that the unarmed teen had his hands up, or by his side, and begged the officer 'Stop shooting.'

The office of St Louis Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said that they will unseal all evidence reviewed by the Grand Jury following their decision and release it to the public.
