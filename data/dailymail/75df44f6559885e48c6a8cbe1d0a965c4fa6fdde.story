An invitation to a Christmas Eve slumber party with the Victoria's Secret girls would be many people's idea of the perfect gift.

And so, as a festive treat, seven of the lingerie brand's Angels have given classic poem 'Twas The Night Before Christmas' a cute twist.

Dressed in printed pyjamas (it's a Christmas miracle that anyone can make flannelette look good, but these pros manage it) the models take it in turn to read lines from the poem in a new short film featuring feelgood Christmas card designs.

Some of the words have been adapted to suit the glamorous group, which includes Lily Aldridge, 29, Alessandra Ambrosio, 33, Adriana Lima, 33, Behati Prinsloo, 25, Candice Swanepoel, 26, Doutzen Kroes, 29 and Karli Kloss, 22.

Instead of stockings, the women have hung 'lingerie' with care 'in hopes all the Angels soon will be there'.

And the names of the famous reindeer have been replaced with Doutzen, Candice, Karli, Lily, Behati, Ally (Alessandra) and Adriana.

The poem, whose full title is 'A Visit From St. Nicholas', was written by American Clement Clarke Moore in 1823 and is still one of the most popular festive readings at celebrations around the world.

In the film the girls take it in turn to read whilst curled up in velvet armchairs  as well as creeping around the cartoon house chomping on Santa's cookies and delivering presents, before finishing by blowing kisses to the camera and declaring: 'Happy holidays to all, and to all a goodnight.'
