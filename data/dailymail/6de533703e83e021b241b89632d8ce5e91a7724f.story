America needs to seriously start worrying about how it educates its young judging by some of the tweets that have been flying around the Twitter-verse in recent days.

For some ill-informed souls it appears Tuesday night will usher in a lot more than just another year and is also the time when Americans will celebrate the 2,014th birthday of this great nation.

Seriously? Well sarcasm isn’t a form of humor that works well over 140 characters so it is hard to distinguish between those that think they’re being super funny and those who clearly didn’t pay much attention in history class.

Revelers stand in Times Square during last year's New Year's Eve celebrations: Some ill-informed souls believe that the United States was formed 2014 years ago, and that New Year's Day is America's birthday

Some even more deluded souls have been tweeting that in fact it’s the earth celebrating its 2,014th birthday when the clock strikes 12 on Tuesday night and that great big glittery ball in Times Square drops.

If some of these people are serious with their belief that the United States was formed 2014 years ago, and that New Year's Day is America's birthday, it begs the question that what exactly do they think July 4 is all about?

This guy raises a good point...

It's not America celebrating, it's the earth. Doh!

Some people are a bit more confused than others...

For other Twitter users the joke is starting to wear a bit thin...

Confetti will fly over New York's Times Square after the clock strikes midnight during New Year's Eve celebrations, just don't go thinking that means America has turned 2014
