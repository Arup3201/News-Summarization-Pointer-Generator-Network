A former Army psychiatrist who killed 13 people in a shooting spree at an army base in Texas has reportedly written a letter to the Pope praising Islamist jihad.

Nidal Hasan, who opened fire at Fort Hood on fellow service personnel at Fort Hood in 2009, has apparently composed the letter under the acronym SoA, thought to mean Soldier of Allah.

It is believed he has now directed his attorney John Galligan to send on the six-page, handwritten letter to Pope Francis.

Nidal Hasan, the former Army psychiatrist who killed 13 people in a shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas. He has now wrote a letter to the Pope, where he praises Islamic jihad 

The letter, written by Hasan for the Pontiff, pictured, is reportedly entitled 'A Warning to Pope Francis, Members of the Vatican and Other Religious Leaders Around The World' 

According to Fox News, who have seen the letter, it is entitled 'A Warning to Pope Francis, Members of The Vatican, and Other Religious Leaders Around the World.'

In a subsection titled, Jihad, he praises 'The willingness to fight for All-Mighty Allah'.

He also states that 'fighters... have a greater rank in the eyes of Allah than believers who don't fight.'

Mr Galligan says the letter reinforces how religious zeal underscores his actions and mental processes.

However families of the victims say it is clear that Hasan is trying to use jihad as a way of justifying the Fort Hood tragedy.

The letter comes just over a month after it was reported that Hasan also wrote to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Hasan had previously written a letter to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, saying it would be an honour to join the caliphate 

In it he said that it would be an 'an honor' to join the caliphate and has made request to be made a 'citizen' of the Islamic State.

Hasan is currently on death row at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas after the shooting on November 5, killing 13 and injuring 30 others.

During the incident he walked into the Fort Hood medical readiness building carrying two guns and several magazines of ammunition.

He shouted 'Allahu Akbar!' - Arabic for 'God is great!' - and opened fire on soldiers awaiting medical tests and vaccines.

Mourners at a memorial service to remember those who died during the gun attack. The families of Fort Hood victims say Hasan is trying to use jihad as a way of justifying the Fort Hood tragedy 

He was shot and paralyzed from the waist down in the resulting gunfire and was sentenced to death last year.

Hasan described himself at trial as a soldier who 'switched sides' in a supposed war between America and Islam. Government lawyers also said Hasan did not want to go on an impending deployment to Afghanistan.

Earlier this year FBI Director James Comey testified that he believed the shooting carried out by Hasan at Fort Hood in Texas was inspired by al-Qaeda.

The federal government has termed the attack an incidence of 'workplace violence,' saying that the home-grown Hasan didn't meet the legal definition of an international terrorist.
