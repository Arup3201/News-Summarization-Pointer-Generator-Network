West Brom head coach Alan Irvine has told Saido Berahino to maintain his red hot form - even if it means sparking unwanted interest.

The 21-year-old is the top English scorer in the Barclays Premier League with four goals this season ahead of the Baggies' trip to Liverpool on Saturday.

He was tipped for a call-up to the Three Lions' senior side but has been included in Gareth Southgate's Under 21 squad for their Euro 2015 play-off games with Croatia instead.

Irvine wants Berahino to continue his early season scoring streak and is not worried about interest from elsewhere.

'I certainly wouldn't want Saido not to play well because I didn't want him going anywhere else,' he said.

'It's in everyone's best interests that he continues to play as well as he's been playing - and continues to develop.

'And if in the end he goes somewhere else - and it's a move that is seen as taking his career to the next level, then that would be fantastic and he'd go with our blessing.

'So the message is to carry on playing well and scoring loads of goals - if he does that we'll all be happy.'

Berahino's brace helped the Baggies beat Burnley 4-0 last week and they go to Anfield on the back of three straight wins.

And if he keeps scoring then Irvine insisted he would not be under any pressure to sell the England Under-21 international.

'If Saido gets to the stage where there's a while load of big clubs chasing after him - then he'll have done a brilliant job for us in the meantime,' he said.

'Then it becomes a matter of whether the club want to do business with anyone or not. There's no set rule as far as that's concerned.

'The club will make the decision on any player who's attracting attention from other clubs.

'As we've shown already this summer, we've kept hold of some players who other clubs were chasing - but we let others go.

'It would depend on the nature of anything that happened down the line.'
