A long-time producer for The View has been fired after publicly berating host Rosie O'Donnell.

An insider told Page Six that Jennifer Shepard-Brookman was 'profoundly and publicly disrespectful' to the returning host back in February.

After an initial suspension, eight-year The View veteran Shepard-Brookman was fired last week.

According to the Page Six source, the spat began when Shepard-Brookman was complaining about O'Donnell behind her back.

Dissed Rosie? An insider told Page Six that Jennifer Shepard-Brookman was 'profoundly and publicly disrespectful' to the returning host back in February

'During a production meeting, Jennifer began mumbling behind Rosie, who told her, "If you have something to say, say it to my face!" So Jennifer did — she laced into Rosie, and there was a shouting match,' the source said.

Staff members, including O'Donnell, were appalled enough by her behavior to complain. Now, ABC top brass have answered in the form of her termination.

Not that Rosie O'Donnell cares all that much. The incident occurred right around the time she announced she is leaving The View for a second time.

Her publicist, Cindi Berger, said in early February that the outspoken co-host of the ABC daytime chat show would be exiting to focus on her five children after the breakup of her marriage.

Berger says O'Donnell and Michelle Rounds, her wife of three years, split in November.

The 52-year-old O'Donnell had returned to The View only last summer. Her initial yearlong stay ended stormily in 2007.

Now in its 18th season, the program recently was the target of rumors that a fellow panelist, Rosie Perez, had left for good to appear in a new Broadway play, but she returned.

Moderator Whoopi Goldberg and Nicolle Wallace remain with Perez on the show, which was created by Barbara Walters in 1997.

'During a production meeting, Jennifer began mumbling behind Rosie, who told her, "If you have something to say, say it to my face!" So Jennifer did — she laced into Rosie, and there was a shouting match,' the source said.
