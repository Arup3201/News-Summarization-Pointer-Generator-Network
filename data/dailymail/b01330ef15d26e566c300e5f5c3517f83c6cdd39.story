If you often let half-drunk bottles of wine go to waste, there’s a nifty way to save it.

A gadget called Winesave protects opened wine by injecting argon, an inert and odourless gas, into the bottle.

The gas is heavier than air, so sinks to the surface of the liquid, protecting its taste by providing a ‘perfect and impenetrable seal’.

Preservative: The small bottle can preserve up to 100 bottles of wine using layers of the inert gas

Protected: Winesave uses argon, an inert gas which sits on the surface of the wine, to stop it oxidising

Wine usually decays on contact with oxygen in the air, which leads to its sharp, vingerary taste after too long exposes to the elements. 

It means you’ll never again have to pour oxidised wine down the sink. Simply squirt argon from the Winesave canister and replace the cap or cork. 

According to the manufacturers, the bottles will keep for weeks after being treated with the gas, which has no effect on the flavour or any other quality of the wine. 

Each can has enough gas for 100 bottles: £19.95 from winesave.com
