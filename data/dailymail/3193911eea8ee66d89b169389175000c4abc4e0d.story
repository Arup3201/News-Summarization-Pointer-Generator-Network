Floyd Mayweather Jnr may be undefeated in the ring - but he more than met his match in a south London barbers.

The pound-for-pound No 1, fresh from his victory in his rematch with Marcos Maidana last month, was in Brixton on Tuesday night for a trim.

But he was accosted by a female customer who told him she had no idea who he was. 

Floyd Mayweather was shocked when a woman told him she didn't know who he was

'I don't know you,' she said in a video posted on SpiffTV. 'What's the big deal? I just don't watch boxing. I know about Mike Tyson.'

Mayweather, who was accompanied by several members of 'The Money Team', appeared stunned and retorted: 'You know what? I need to Google you!'

But the woman refuses to back down, saying: 'I just want to know what the biggest fight you ever fight is? 

'I like big fights, I like exciting fights,' she says. 'If it's not big, I don't watch it.'

At this point, one of Mayweather's team interjects: 'He's the biggest in the world.'

The woman in the barbers said she knew who Mike Tyson (right) was and that she watched big fights

Tyson was the undisputed heavyweight world champion and one of the most feared boxers on the planet

Mayweather did his best to convince the woman that he was the biggest name in boxing

Floyd Mayweather $105m

Cristiano Ronaldo $80m

LeBron James $72.3m

Lionel Messi $64.7m

Kobe Bryant $61.5m

Tiger Woods $61.2m

Roger Federer $56.2m

Phil Mickelson $53.2m

Rafael Nadal $44.5m

Matt Ryan $43.8m

Unrelenting, the woman takes another dig when she says: 'I know Usain Bolt', to which Mayweather responds: 'Who?'.

The 37-year-old, by now struggling to convince her, tries one last time: 'Do you know what Forbes Magazine is? Well you go and pull up one of those.

'You know the Money Man? He makes over $100 million in 60 minutes.'

According to Forbes, Mayweather made $105m from his first fight with Maidana and his clash with Saul Alvarez last year, a total of 72 minutes in the ring.

He has been on a whirlwind tour of Europe, having been in Paris last weekend before heading for Istanbul and London. He then delivered a boxing masterclass in Moscow on Wednesday. 

He is expected to return to the ring in May with Briton Amir Khan among those clambering for a pay day.
