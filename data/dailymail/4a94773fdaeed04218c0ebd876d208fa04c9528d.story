They had rehearsed for weeks. Their halos shone. So, knowing a very proud mummy was somewhere in the audience, the children stepped up for their big moment…

And in walked a policeman demanding the nativity play be stopped, for the grave offence of bad parking.

With little regard for Christmas spirit – or the nerves of small wise men and shepherds, never mind Mary – he ordered parents to move their cars, which he said were blocking the pavements outside and stopping patients parking at a doctor’s surgery.

Put your halos up! PC Paul Baker, circled, interrupts the show at Redehall Preparatory School's nativity play

'Petty': PC Baker refuted claims that he was heavy handed and said he carried out his duty and that there was nothing else he could have done

So as the play restarted, some parents
 were forced to miss their little one’s starring role, instead trudging 
down the road to shift their vehicles.

Yesterday
 PC Paul Baker was accused of ‘petty meddling’ and being ‘heavy-handed’ 
for interrupting the nativity play, performed by children from Redehall 
Preparatory School in Smallfield, Surrey.

The
 play, Tinsel And Tea Towels, a humorous take on the traditional 
nativity scene, was held at the centenary hall in Burstow, near Reigate,
 on Monday night.

An uncle 
of one of the pupils at the £4,860-a-year school, who asked not to be 
named, said: ‘The play had been on for 15 minutes when the policeman 
walked in and stopped it.

‘Most
 of the parents were shocked as they thought someone had committed a 
serious crime. They thought they were going to be arrested.

Regretful parking: Many parents were upset as they missed their children performing in the Redehall Prepatory School nativity play as they had to move their cars

‘He said, “Excuse me, I have to stop 
the show as some people have parked in a bad location near the doctors’ 
surgery. Please park down the road and walk back to the hall.”

‘At
 this stage, everyone laughed as they had all thought that someone was 
about to be arrested. He then stayed until people started to go and move
 their cars.

‘He left after 
saying sorry for stopping the play. The play then restarted even though 
some parents missed it. I think everyone was really shocked that the 
policeman had stopped the play because of bad parking.’

He
 said some of the parents claimed they had received parking tickets. But
 PC Baker said he had only issued one ‘warning’ ticket.

'No Parking': The play was held at the Centenary Village Hall, pictured, in Smallfield, Surrey

Move thy car: When the car park outside the Village hall, left, was full, parents had to park their cars on Wheelers road, right, to which PC Baker objected

The
 uncle added: ‘It’s petty meddling and it was a heavy-handed response to
 what was really not that big a deal.’ But PC Baker claims the bad 
parking was a ‘safety hazard’, explaining he had been on foot patrol 
when two residents stopped him and complained about it.

Of the play, he said: ‘They’d just finished a song and it was near the opening of the play, but there was nothing else I could have done really.

‘I didn’t go in there sort of spelling 
out the law and saying you must do this, wagging my finger or anything 
like that. It was quite low-key.

‘I eased in and said, “Look, I don’t like doing this, sorry to interrupt, but there is a safety issue here. You can’t park on the pavement; it’s not acceptable.

‘If you can take this opportunity now to remove those cars. And most people did.’

He added: ‘It wasn’t heavy-handed in any sort of shape or form.

'It was just a nice, gentle typical neighbourhood police officer response really.

‘There was a lack of understanding, I think. Not from everyone, from some people, thinking well, what’s the problem.

‘They couldn’t quite grasp that, yeah, you’re parked on the pavement and people have to walk on the road it’s a safety issue.’

He added: ‘If I hadn’t done anything, I’d have got more complaints from the residents than I’d get from a few parents. The majority were supportive.’

The headmistress of Redehall Preparatory School declined to comment.
