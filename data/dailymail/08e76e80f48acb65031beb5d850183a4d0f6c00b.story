One 10-year-old Girl Scout deserves a badge for bravery after she attempted to stop a thief who stole $300 right off her hands while her troop sold cookies outside a grocery store.

Sophia Contos got into a tug-of-war with Cody Phillip Gintz as she tried to hold on tight to the scouts' cash box, but the man was too strong and pulled it away, according to police.

Contos said she had noticed him eyeing the box earlier while the troop was outside a San Jose, California Safeway, and did her best to guard it.

Girl Scout Sophia Contos, 10, tried to stop Cody Phillip Gintz from stealing the troop's cash box, which had $300 inside, as they sold cookies outside a grocery store 

Contos said she had noticed Gintz eyeing the box earlier and tried to protect it  but Gintz suddenly went for it. 'I jerk it away but he's too strong and he gets it,' she said 

Gintz returned to the parking lot after throwing the cash box in a nearby creek. That's when Contos' mom, who was with the troop (pictured), saw his car and memorized his license plate 

'I keep my hands on the box and start to pull it away and all of a sudden he goes for it,' she told NBC Bay Area. 'I jerk it away but he’s too strong and he gets it.' 

Gintz, 23, was arrested for strong arm robbery. He said he stole the money because he was 'desperate' for a fix for his daily heroin habit 

Contos yelled as Gintz got away. The 23-year-old then stashed the camouflage-print box, decorated with a silver star, in a nearby creek before he returned to Safeway's parking lot to retrieve his truck, authorities say. 

That's when Contos' mom Michelle said she spotted the familiar face and began reading his license plate 'over and over again' to memorize the numbers. 

Police then quickly spotted Gintz's truck and pulled him over. 

They found the $300 on him and arrested Gintz for strong arm robbery. Gintz said he immediately confessed to the police and told them where to find the cash box, later retrieved by a K-9.

Gintz said he stole the money because he 'needed a fix really bad' for his daily heroin habit, but didn't have any money. 

He said the incident was the first time he had stolen money for drugs.  

'It kind of takes over a lot of you, including your rational thought process,' he said in an exclusive interview with NBC Bay Area in jail, where he showed visible withdrawal symptoms from the drug.

'Normally I would never even try, but I was desperate so I tried.' 

Gintz said afterwards he immediately knew what he did was wrong.

San Jose police returned the $300 to the troop, with an extra $60 donation, and then bought the remaining $240 worth of cookies they still had left

Gintz told police where he hid the cash box (pictured) and a K-9 retrieved it from the creek. The troop is currently raising money for a water conservation project

'The reason why I feel bad is because my little sister was a Girl Scout and it just reminded me of her after I did that,' he said. 

Gintz said he would tell the girls he was sorry and that he hoped Contos had suffered no 'emotional trauma'.

Contos admitted she had been shaken up by the robbery. 

'I didn't really know that a guy would do that,' she told NBC. 'That there were people around here who would do such a thing.' 

'It just made me feel bad.'  

But the San Jose police were on hand to cheer Sophia and her fellow Girl Scouts up. 

Not only was the $300 returned to the troop, but the police bought the remaining $240 worth of cookies they still had left. 

They also added an extra $60 donation. 

The troop is raising money for a water conservation project.  

Contos, whose troop was selling cookies outside a San Jose, California Safeway (pictured), said the incident made her 'feel bad'. 'I didn't really know that a guy would do that,' she said
