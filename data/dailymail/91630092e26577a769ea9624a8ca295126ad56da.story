Tragic Danni Tripp, 20, took slimming pills and suffered a heart attack

A cleaner died after taking DMAA slimming pills - the same supplement that a London Marathon runner took before dying of a heart attack on the course.

Danni Tripp was killed when she took the pills - which was a caffeine hit equivalent to 40 cups of coffee - but was sent home from a hospital because a doctor failed to recognise how seriously ill she was.

Danni took the dietary supplement Dexaprine - known as DMAA - after splitting up from her long-term boyfriend three days earlier, an Oxford inquest heard today.

The 20-year-old had been on a night out with friends drinking lager, Jagerbombs - which contain caffeine - and Smirnoff Ices when she returned home upset in the early hours of the morning.

She complained of feeling unwell to her mother Teresa Crowley 30 minutes later and was rushed to hospital, the hearing was told.

However, a doctor could not find details of the substance on the hospital computer so sent her home within 75 minutes.

But she suffered a seizure at home in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, just over two hours later on December 11, 2011.

She was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, by ambulance for the second time that day, but died of a heart attack.

The coroner said he would be taking up the issues with the hospital trust.

Toxicology tests showed she died of caffeine and multiple drug toxicity according to consultant forensic toxicologist Mark Tyler.

There was also 71mgs of alcohol in her blood - a moderate amount after the alcohol would have been broken down in her body.

Pathologist Dr Sanjiv Manek told the 
coroner that Danni suffered a cardiac arrhythmia and an abnormal heart 
rhythm due to the overdose.

'The heart cannot pump blood around the body in the normal way,' he said.

'Organs suffer as a result, including the brain especially,' said the pathologist.

The inquest was told that Danni had come out of a two-year relationship with Damian MooreÂ  just three days before the fatal incident.

A doctor treating her said he had 'given in to the family's request to discharge her early.'

Giving evidence, Dr Aquib Hafeez said the patient was 'hyperactive' when she arrived at hospital for the first time.

But Danni seemed to come down from the high after about an hour.

'She had calmed down, her temperature was down, her family was willing to look after her, she had not taken paracetamol (along with pills). I gave in and agreed to it (discharged her),' he said.

'I was going to keep her in and observe her. They (the family) said if you're going to observe her why can't we take her home?

'I decided to go with them. They did not force me or persuade me.

'I could not find the drug on Toxbase and was going towards safety than toxic.'

He said he had not come across caffeine overdoses as part of his clinical practice to this harmful effect.

But he said he could have rung Toxbase, a phone service where a consultant is available to offer advice about drugs.

The doctor was unable to find information about the drug under the hospital's online drug database.

The inquest heard that Danni arrived at hospital just before 5.30am.

She was discharged about 75 minutes later at 6.45am but returned by 10.17am and was pronounced dead at 11.56am.

Nurse
 Nash Rustom said he was unable to carry out his baseline observation 
because of the patient's erratic behaviour when she was first admitted.

'She was really agitated and was trying to climb over the bedside,' he said.

'She was not verbalising. It was hard to understand. It was difficult to do my observation.

'I would normally check heart rate and blood pressure. It was hard. She was moving the opposite way.'

Danni was unsteady on her feet so the hospital provided a wheelchair.

Dr
 Rick Pullinger, who treated Ms Tripp during her second visit to 
hospital, said that supportive treatment may not have resulted in saving
 her life.

He claimed that observation or 
treatment in the intensive care unit may not have been successful even 
if it had been administered at an earlier stage.

The hearing was told that Danni's boyfriend had purchased the DMAA diet pills over the internet.

The pills were taken off the market in their current state in February, last year.

Dexaprine is described as a 'popular stimulant-based fat burner' and the 'most potent fat burner available on the market'.

It is meant to give the user energy and suppress the appetite, making it a key ingredient in strong diet pills and exercise supplements.

The UK's medicines watchdog MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) ruled last August that it is unlicensed and that all other DMAA containing products needed to be removed from the market to protect public safety.

Although DMAA is not illegal to take or possess in the UK it is no longer licensed so cannot be sold.

The decision followed similar warnings around the world, including in the US and Australia where a man died after buying DMAA online.

DMAA, most commonly used as a workout aid or dietary supplement, can have a physiological effect on the body by narrowing the arteries and raising the heart rate, said the MHRA.

This has been linked to suspected adverse drug reactions worldwide, ranging from shortness of breath to heart attacks.

Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter said he would be writing to the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust to highlight the importance of having set protocol when certain drugs are not listed on a hospital's database.

He will also write to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to make them aware of the tragic case.

There have been 17 deaths of this kind in America, but only Danni and Marathon runner Claire Squires are known to have died in the UK.

Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said: 'I do not intend to apportion blame.

'There was no evidence Danni Tripp had taken any illegal substances and she had no underling health problems.

'It is quite alarming considering how death is so rare from caffeine toxicity.

'After an evening drinking, Danni Tripp arrived back home in Abingdon.

'At 4am she took slimming pills. There was no intent to take her own life or any sign to harm herself.

'By about 5.30am she had arrived at hospital and was discharged home.

'At 8.45am her condition deteriorated. She arrived back at the hospital by about 10.20am. Time of death was given as 11.56am on December 11, 2011.

'She had suffered a cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity.'

He added: 'My condolences go to the family. I extend my deepest sympathies for their loss. This was an exceptionally sad turn of events.

Speaking after the inquest a tearful Ms Crowley, who is a mother-of-four, said: 'Danni was a lovely girl, full of life, very caring, who was very much the party girl.

'I don't believe she knew what effect the pills would have had when she took them. There's no way she would have done that knowing the risks.

'The inquest has been very thorough, but it won't bring her back, will it?'
