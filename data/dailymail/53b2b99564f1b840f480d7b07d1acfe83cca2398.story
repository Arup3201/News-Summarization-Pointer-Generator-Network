This 87-year-old great-grandmother has taken a hot air balloon ride, been in a helicopter flight and travelled to Australia - twice.

Now Betty Bicker-Robinson, from Cobham, Kent, has jumped out of a plane from 12,000ft.

Betty, who has eight children and 13 great-grandchildren, had such a good time that she's vowed to do it again when she turns 90.

Up in the air: The brave great-grandmother was the first one out of the plane 

Ms Bicker-Robinson completed a tandem skydive last Sunday at Headcorn Airfield in Kent last Sunday to raise funds for EllenorLions Hospices.

She told Good Morning Britain she wanted to raise funds for the hospice because they were 'so wonderful' to her when she lost her husband Ted Robinson to cancer earlier this year, saying that she 'can't repay them enough'.

'My grandson said to me, "What can you do next Grandma, jump from a plane?"

'I said, "That's an idea! I'll do it for the hospice",' she explained.

She said that 'the plane was very noisy but it was all lovely,' when answering hosts Susanna Reid and Ben Shephard's questions.

The daredevil grandmother told Good Morning Britain she 'hoped for the best' when she jumped out of the plane

Back to earth: Ms Bicker-Robinson enjoyed the jump so much, she's planning to do another when she's 90

She was the first one out of the plane, saying: 'I'd sooner do that than watch other people and think "oh, that's what I've got to do"'.

'I thought "here goes" and hoped for the best,' she told Mr Shephard when he asked her how she felt when she was about to jump.

'That's me, crazy. You have got to be crazy, haven't you?' she said.

And the daredevil great-grandmother is not finished yet.

'When I'm 90, I'm going to jump again!'
