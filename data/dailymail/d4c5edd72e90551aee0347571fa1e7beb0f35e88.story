Southampton will hold a second round of talks with Ronald Koeman next week as the Dutchman emerges as the front-runner to replace Mauricio Pochettino as manager.

Koeman left Feyenoord at the end of last season and is keen to manage in the Premier League.

The new man's first job will be to deal with interest in Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Dejan Lovren from rival clubs.

Pochettino left the Saints after guiding them to eighth in the Premier League last year, and has been highly regarded for his work at St Mary's.

His free-flowing, attacking football and ability to bring young English talent through were what attracted Spurs to the Argentine.

Pochettino took the helm at White Hart Lane towards the end of May and was given a five-year deal by chairman Daniel Levy, replacing the axed Tim Sherwood.
