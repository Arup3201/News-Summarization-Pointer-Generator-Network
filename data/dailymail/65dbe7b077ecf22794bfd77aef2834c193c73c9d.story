The survey found that the festive season is particularly stressful for those who are divorced or separated.

So much for the season of goodwill: it appears quite a lot of us find Christmas more hassle than it's worth.

More than 40 per cent of British 
people say they find the festivities 'very stressful' while one in 
three (33 per cent) say they 'just want the Christmas season to be over 
as soon as possible'.

The
 research was based on a poll of more than 4,000 British adults for 
Resolution, the body representing 6,500 family law professionals in 
England and Wales.

The survey found that the festive season is particularly stressful for those who are divorced or separated.

Almost half (47 per cent) of them found the period 'very stressful', rising again to 50 per cent of divorced British women.

Arguments over where the children will spend Christmas, competing grandparents, factoring new partners into the equation and a fear of being left alone during the holidays can all add up to a huge amount of anxiety.

As a result, 40 per cent of British 
adults who have been separated or divorced in the past and are not 
currently in a relationship or marriage say that they 'just want the 
Christmas season to be over as soon as possible', compared to just 30 per cent for people who haven't been through a breakup.

The
 problem is even more acute among the older generation. A staggering 50 
per cent of divorced pensioners (over-65s) are wishing the festive 
season over before it's even begun

More than 40 per cent of British people say they find the festivities 'very stressful' while one in three (33 per cent) say they 'just want the Christmas season to be over as soon as possible'

Liz
 Edwards, Chair of Resolution, said: 'It’s clear from this poll that 
couples who have separated or divorced find the festive season 
significantly more stressful than most other people.

'And it’s no wonder: all too often break-ups can lead to stress and unresolved long-term problems between former partners'

'It’s
 so important – particularly when children are involved – that 
separating couples find the best long-term solutions, so they can make 
arrangements together where possible.

'Indeed,
 managing childcare and working out how separated parents will see their
 children over the festive period can be often a major cause of stress. 
Half of all separated couples break up at a time when at least one child
 aged is under the age of 16.'

Separated or divorced couples in their 20s and early 30s feel most lonely at Christmas, with four our of ten reporting feeling isolated and unhappy

And
 stress isn't the only Christmas bugbear. Loneliness is also rife: the 
report found that separated or divorced couples in their 20s and 
early 30s feel most lonely at Christmas, with four our of ten reporting 
feeling isolated and unhappy.

This
 compares to just 21 per cent of separated or divorced couples of any 
age who say they are lonely at Christmas, falling to 17 pr cent of the 
general public (and just 15 per cent of those who have never been 
separated or divorced).

 One
 in four (25 per cent) of British women who have ever been separated or 
divorced say that the 'Christmas season brings back bad memories; 
compared to 19 per cent for the general public.

Young
 divorcees most stressed by making Christmas arrangements: Four in ten 
(41 per cent) of the general public say that making arrangements over 
Christmas stressful but this leaps to almost six in ten (58 per cent) 
for young people who have been separated or divorced (between the ages 
of 18-34).

As part of Family
 Dispute Resolution Week (25th – 29th November 2013) Resolution is 
launching a new advice guide, providing more information about the 
options available for couples going through separation or divorce. This 
guide can be downloaded at: www.resolution.org.uk/separatingtogether
