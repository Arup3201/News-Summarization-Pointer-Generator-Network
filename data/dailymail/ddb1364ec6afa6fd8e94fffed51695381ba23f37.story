Paula Hamilton today compared herself with 'Bridget Jones' and said she was being punished for being an eccentric after being found guilty of assaulting a policeman with a sunflower.

The former supermodel ranted as she left court after being convicted of punching an officer and fined more £1,065.

She had drunk a bottle of wine before she tore the head off a sunflower and attacked the officer who had been called to her home after reports that she was threatening to kill herself.

She had denied assaulting the officer 
and claimed she had been trying to give five policeman called to her 
home the distinctive sunflower as an apologetic gift.

Magistrates found the 52-year-old 
guilty of assaulting PC Dominic Matheson and ordered her to pay a total 
of £1,065 pounds in fines.

Paula Hamilton's life has seen the model rise to fortune and fame before falling into a battle with drink and court cases.

In 1987 she appeared in a famous advert for the VW Golf. Made up to look like Princess Diana, she played a glamorous blonde who petulantly discarded her wedding ring, her mink coat and her man, but refused to abandon the keys to her car.

'If only everything in life was as reliable as a Volkswagen,' ran the tagline, and so the legend of Paula Hamilton was created.

But she became famous for her struggle with drink and drugs, confessing she used to drink 'in order to die'.

In September last year she was found collapsed in an alley with her three front teeth missing after she crashed her car drink-driving.

In November she was banned from driving for 14 months and fined £160 for drink-driving.

She asked to go on an alcohol vehicle awareness course, which will reduce her ban by three months.

The star, who suffers from a complex amalgam of conditions, including Asperger's, dyslexia and dyspraxia, which affects her movement, was then invited to star on Celebrity Big Brother in January.

But the contestant was the first to be evicted from the house.

Speaking outside the court Hamilton criticised magistrates and police and described herself as an 'eccentric'.

'I think it's very sad that if I was 
Miss Bridget Jones, lying on the sofa drinking wine, that would be okay.
But because I'm an eccentric and I have a different lifestyle, I'm 
treated like this,' she said.

'I had a drink, a bottle of wine like Bridget Jones.

'My crime today is that I have an 
alternative lifestyle where all people are robots, everyone is bullied 
at school and everyone has their tiny bit of expertise.

'I have many facets to my relationship with myself. I'm a published author twice, I'm an accomplished actress and a model.

'But once the newspapers and the court system get you, that's it.

'I'm very pro-UK. I'm pro-police but 
I'm now beginning to wonder how many days has the court wasted on me 
giving a flower to a policeman.'

Hamilton, who was the first housemate 
evicted from the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother, claimed 
officers had then brutally beaten her and taken her to a police station 
while she was wearing nothing but a coat.

But today magistrates rejected Miss Hamilton's version of events and said that her evidence had not been 'credible.'

'We find that the dependent did strike
Pc Matheson. We have reached this conclusion because all three police 
constables gave evidence that the defendent turned and moved forward 
towards Pc Matheson," said presiding magistrates Ken Birkby.

'She pulled her arm forwards, striking him on her upper chest.

'PC Matheson was certain he was punched. The other two police constables saw the blow and backward movement of Pc Matheson.

'The defendant's evidence was completely at odds with the three prosecution witnesses.

'She was highly emotional, swearing and admitted drinking heavily.'

Wearing a stylish navy coat, high 
heels and a turquoise scarf the former face of car firm Volkswagen 
looked emotionless as the verdict was delivered.

The court heard that Hamilton ran barefoot into the garden of her home, tore the head off a sunflower and then punched PC Matheson in the chest

At the start of her trial earlier this
month, Aylesbury Magistrates' Court, Bucksinghamshire, heard how 
Hamilton had got drunk on wine after the collapse of a relationship with
a man she was 'very much in love' with.

Magistrates heard family friend Jon 
Bunce, with whom Hamilton lives in a rural cottage, called police after 
the star threatened to kill herself and was throwing knives around.

Hamilton said she had taken up 
gardening and had been growing a 14ft Great Mammoth Sunflower she claims
is also seen on Prince Charles' estate.

Magistrates were told by prosecutor 
James Cartwright that Hamilton ran barefoot into the garden of her home 
in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, tore the head off a sunflower and 
then punched PC Matheson in the chest.

However, she said that she would not 
use the flower to hurt anyone as it was her 'sacred' family crest, and 
that she had tried to give it to PC Matheson as a present.

The star claimed she had fallen 
backwards as she tried to pull the plant free and accidentally come into
contact with Pc Matheson.

David Hicks, defending, told the court
today that Hamilton had caused PC Matheson no injury, and reminded the 
bench that the officers had been called to her home at around 3.30am on 
September 29 last year, to help her.

'They were presented with someone who 
was causing them some concern for her own safety, there are those issues
which lessen her culpability,' he said.

Mr Hicks said that Hamilton had not yet received all of her pay from Celebrity Big Brother, with the remainder due in March.

The court was told her income from 
this year so far had been £7,500 pounds. Mr Hicks handed the magistrates
copies of Hamilton's medical records and photographs of her 
'alternative lifestyle', which were not disclosed to the court.

'I'm off for the next two months not working due to my doctor, with no future work or contracts,' said Hamilton.

She was ordered to pay a fine of £400 
pounds, a £15 pounds victim surcharge, and £650 pounds in costs, but did
not have to pay PC Matheson compensation.

The former supermodel starred in a blockbuster advertising campaign for Volkswagen in the 1980s which made her a household name.
