FOUR firemen died after bosses  ordered them into a blazing warehouse containing just cardboard boxes and old furniture, a court heard yesterday.

With an inferno raging at the vegetable packing factory, they were allegedly sent into a smoke-filled storage room even though there was no one inside.

All employees at the factory in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, had been accounted for when the men were told to go in, the court heard.

As three fire service managers faced trial yesterday, prosecutors described the deaths as ‘needless’. 

The bodies of Ashley Stephens, 20, John Averis, 27, and Darren Yates-Badley, 24, were found in the gutted building. Ian Reid, 44, died in hospital.

The tragedy in 2007 is believed to have been the single worst loss of life for the fire service in 35 years.

Prosecutor Richard Matthews QC told Stafford Crown Court the firemen, who were all part-timers, had lost their lives ‘as a result of having been sent into a situation where no one was in peril and no one required rescue’.

Mr Matthews told the jury: ‘The four men lost their lives not in a valiant effort to rescue anyone, but having been ordered into a smoke-filled large storage compartment containing mostly cardboard boxes.

This is not a case about what some see as the irritating trivialities of health and safety red tape.

‘This is not about stopping the heroic members of our emergency services from risking their lives, and the lives of those who may be under their command, to save others.

‘Rather, it’s only about the needless loss of four lives, four individuals, lost as a result of having been sent into a situation where no one was in peril... sent into what was and should have been recognised as an obviously dangerous situation for no good reason.’ 

More than 80 firemen and 16 fire engines tackled the blaze for more than five hours on November 2.

The court heard how Mr Reid became separated from his colleagues before being found by a rescue team in a storage area in a ‘disorientated and panicked state’.

He was ‘seen to rush from his would-be rescuers, attempting to find his way out from the very smoky storage area’. When he was found again he wasn’t breathing.

As conditions worsened, rescuers retreated without finding the three remaining members of the team.

Mr Matthews said the blaze was not properly assessed by commanders and the defendants had ‘badly failed to fulfil their duties to the firefighters under their command’.

‘What should have been apparent was 
that sending firefighters into that situation... with inadequate 
resources, was unnecessarily dangerous,’ he told the jury.

‘Those who are ordered to put 
themselves at risk of death as part of the vital job they do for the 
public are entitled to expect that this will not be done without proper 
competent care having been taken.’

Warwickshire Fire Service managers 
Paul Simmons, 50, Adrian  Ashley, 45, and Tim Woodward, 51, deny  
manslaughter by gross negligence.
