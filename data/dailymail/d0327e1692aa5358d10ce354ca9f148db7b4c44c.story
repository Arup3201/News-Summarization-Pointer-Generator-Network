AFL fans are calling for controversial football commentator Brian Taylor to be sacked after he made further homophobic remarks live on air.

Social media has blown up about the outspoken broadcaster calling Geelong defender Harry Taylor a ‘big poofter’ on live television despite his apology during the half-time break.

The comment came as footage was shown on Channel 7’s Saturday Night Footy panel show of Harry Taylor being chaired from the field last weekend after his 150th game when the popular Cat player did an unusual wave to the crowd.

This is the second time Brian Taylor has been slammed this year for homophobic remarks - he  also described his 3AW colleague Seb Costello's dress sense as 'gay' earlier in the season

‘I don’t know whether you guys down there can hear me or not. I am up here getting ready for the game and I’ve just seen that crap from Harry — he’s a big poofter,’ Taylor said.‘You can’t be doing the old royal wave, next thing you’ll have your mum and dad out there.’

Laughter came from the panel which consisted of Luke Darcy, Cameron Ling, Sam Lane, Matthew Richardson and Mick Molloy, The Herald Sun reported.

The former Richmond and Collingwood full-forward is known for being a long-time critic of players celebrating ‘minor’ milestones.

Taylor then apologised during the half-time break.'In the pre-game show I said something that I regret, and I sincerely apologise in regard to Harry Taylor and anyone — and particularly Harry and any of his friends — that were offended by my remark,' he said.

'I apologise for that and I sincerely regret any harm that I have caused. So, sorry for that.'

This is the second time this year that Taylor has been slammed for making remarks that could be seen as homophobic.

‘I don’t want to offend his upbringing or his parents ... but he looks gay. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just a look as sophisticated is a look, as daggy is a look. You look gay,’ he said when describing his 3AW colleague Seb Costello’s dress sense.

Some of the panellists on the show with Taylor laughed when he made the remarks but the fans are outraged

AFL fans have expressed they have had a gutful of his offensive comments and are calling on Channel 7 to fire the commentator with his remarks being described as disgraceful and shameful on Twitter.

‘Can someone please tell Brian Taylor he is a flog! He is the WORST commentator on tv ever! He needs to find a new job.’ Timothy Sim saidKyran Wheatley ‏said the comment did not help the reputation of the game.

‘With Brian Taylor calling someone a big poofter on the Channel 7 pre game 'comedy' show, I can't imagine why no players have come out,’ Kyran Wheatley

While Dann de Wolff M.B.E. ‏ is capitalising on a possible job opportunity.

‘I really feel like Channel 7 are missing out by not having me as a football commentator. I could pretty easily replace Brian Taylor.’
