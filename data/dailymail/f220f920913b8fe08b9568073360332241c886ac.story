The headless, handless body of a man has been found stuffed in a metal drum in northwest Pennsylvania.

Police have determined the victim, whom they believe to be Gerald Paul VanDyke, 55, of Union City, Pennsylvania, died of an arrow to the heart before he was decapitated and had his hands lopped off.

The grim discovery took place last Friday in Rockdale Township, less than a mile from the home of Richard Alfred Houy, 68, of Cambridge Springs, who is now being held without bond on criminal homicide and other charges.

Search: In Crawford County, search teams had been looking for the missing VanDyke for two weeks

As the body had no head and investigators couldn't use fingerprints, further DNA testing is required to confirm the victim is in fact VanDyke, who has been missing since September 14.Â 

VanDyke was last seen leaving the Erie County home he shared with Houy's daughter, Tina Skelton, NBC News reported.

Houy confessed to killing VanDyke, who was his daughter's longtime boyfriend, state police said in an application for a search warrant.

An autopsy on Sunday revealed that the victim died of a sharp force injury.

Authorities claim Houy plunged a hunting arrow into his victim's heart, rupturing his aorta.

According to NBC News, the search warrant application said Skelton told VanDyke that she wanted to end their decade-long relationship.

It said Skelton told them her father admitted to her that he had killed VanDyke that day and may have dismembered his body.

The police statement said Houy later told police himself that he killed VanDyke.

He is being held in the Crawford County jail without bond awaiting a preliminary hearing October 10.

Theresa VanDyke, VanDyke's aunt, said the victim's family was struggling to come to terms with the gruesome news.

'Who would ever remove parts of the body?' she asked in an interview with WICU.

'It is one thing to get angry and kill someone, but to dismember him like that, that's about a low as you can get.

She described her nephew as a good guy.

'He was a real nice guy,' Theresa VanDyke said. 'He was happy-go-lucky. He was always friendly.'
