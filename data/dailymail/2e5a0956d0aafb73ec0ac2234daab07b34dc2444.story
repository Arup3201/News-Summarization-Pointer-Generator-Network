Pittsburgh Steelers running backs Le'Veon Bell and LeGarrette Blount will be charged with marijuana possession following a traffic stop on Wednesday afternoon.

Ross Township detective Brian Kohlhepp said traffic officer Sean Stafiej pulled over a Camaro operated by Bell around 1:30 p.m. after Stafiej, who was on a motorcycle, noticed a strong smell of marijuana coming from the vehicle.

Stafiej found a 20 gram bag of marijuana inside the car. Bell, Blount and a female passenger all claimed ownership of the marijuana according to police.

Making his mark: Le'Veon Bell set a franchise record for total yards by a rookie running back in his first season

In action: LeGarrette Blount playing against Buffalo

Bell, 22, was taken to a hospital to have blood drawn and is expected to be charged with driving under the influence of marijuana.

Bell, Blount and the female passenger were arrested and released. All three are expected to receive notice of formal charges through the mail said Kohlhepp. The possession and DUI charges are both misdemeanors.

The Steelers take on the Philadelphia Eagles in a NFL pre-season game on Thursday. 

Bell and Blount were expected to see significant playing time in the main tune-up for starters before Pittsburgh's opening game against the Cleveland Browns on September 7.

'We are aware of the reports and still gathering information,' Steelers spokesman Burt Lauten said. 'We will have no further comment at this time.'

Bell, who made his debut against the Minnesota Vikings at Wembley last September, set a franchise record for total yards by a rookie running back, smashing the mark set by Franco Harris.

The second-round pick out of Michigan State ran for 860 yards and eight touchdowns and caught 45 passes for 399 yards despite missing the first three games of the season with a foot injury.
