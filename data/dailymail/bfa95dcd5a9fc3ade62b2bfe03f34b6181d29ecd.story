A single father, his two young sons and one of their friends have perished in a small plane crash, leaving their town of just 200 people in south Canada in shock.

Darren Spence, an experienced crop duster pilot, took off from Waskada, Manitoba with his  sons Gage, 10, and Logan, nine, and nine-year-old Dawson Pentecost, at 1 p.m. on Sunday but crashed into a farmer's field shortly afterwards.

They had taken the afternoon trip as Dawson had never been on a plane before, his family said.

Loss: Ten-year-old Gage SPence and his brother Logan, 9, died in a plane crash with their father and a friend

Spence, 37, piled the children into his six-seater Cessna 210 at a private airstrip near Waskada around 1 p.m. and Pentecost's older brother waved them off, he said.

The plane was headed 70 miles northeast to Brandon, but at 6 p.m., it was reported overdue.

At 6.35 p.m., a Canadian Forces search and rescue team found the crashed plane in a farmer's field three miles from the private airstrip, and the pilot and his passengers were dead at the scene.

Spence, a single father who owned three planes, also had a young daughter, who was not on the doomed aircraft.

'As far as I know, (Spence) was taking the kids up for a recreational flight,' Waskada Mayor Garry Williams told the Toronto Sun as he choked back tears. 'That would not have been unusual.'

He remembered the boys as 'little guys you see walking by your house every day, riding their bikes, playing hockey, just being kids' and called their deaths 'devastating'.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the 
Transportation Safety Board continue to investigate the cause of the 
crash, and said it could take months to reach a conclusion.

'We're going to interview people…that know something about this flight,' Peter Hildebrand from the TSB told CTV News.
 'We're going to have to look at the airplane itself. Was the aircraft 
serviceable? Was it working? Was there any malfunction that might have 
contributed to this?'

Active: The Spence boys loved going in their father's planes and both played on the town's hockey team

Happy boys: They had taken the flight on Sunday as their friend, Dawson, had never been in a plane before

Investigators are also looking at 
whether the weather was involved. Hildebrand said there were low clouds,
 some fog and snow as the plane took off, and ice could have been on the
 plane.

He said that investigation teams were working through the wreckage, which was spread over a large area.

Close friend Terry Linto added to the National Post: 'There's no question. It's not pilot error. It’s got to be mechanical', stressing that Spence always put safety first.

Waskada, a community of about 200 
people, is located about 330 kilometers southwest of Winnipeg and just 
10 miles north of the border of North Dakota.

Scene: Investigators continue to work on the crash site, which was just a couple of miles from the runway

Probe: One of Spence's three planes. The pilot and the young boys perished in a larger six-seater plane

Mourning: Families in Waskada, which has just 200 residents, have been deeply moved by the deaths

Sunrise School Division 
Superintendent Brad Kyle said they had organised counsellors to come to 
Waskada school for anyone in the community who needed someone to speak 
to.

The three boys were all students at the school, which has just 100 students.

'Everyone
 is impacted by the tragedy,' Kyle said. 'The best that we can do is 
have the counselling resources in place to help people through it. And 
that is going to take time.'
