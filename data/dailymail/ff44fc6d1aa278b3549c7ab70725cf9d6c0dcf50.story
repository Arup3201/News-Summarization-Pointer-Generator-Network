Gone are the days when bigger meant better as many stars opted for subtle and sleek hairdos at last night's Oscars. 

When it comes to award ceremony hair understated appears to be popular, and last night's locks were classically beautiful, conforming to old world Hollywood glamour.

The most favoured look appeared to be about keeping hair off the shoulders with Julianne Moore and Marion Cotillard opting for soft up-dos and Naomi Watts and Margot Robbie choosing the trendy LOB (long bob).

When it came to red carpet trends off the shoulder hair won the style stakes with Marion Cotillard, Julianne Moore and Cate Blanchett opting for low slung buns and casual chignons 

Celebrity hairdresser Matthew Curtis talks FEMAIL through the latest hair trends to hit the red carpet with his favourite (and not so favourite) looks of the evening. 

Anna Kendrick: Textured, glamorous pleat

Anna Kendrick's effortless pleat is a red carpet classic if a little 'safe' 

Anna sports a relaxed, textured effortless pleat which complements the simplicity of her beautiful coral dress. 

This season on the red carpet, as well as on the runways, we've seen an abundance of effortless and un-done styles, so Anna's choice is a great combination of on-trend and glamour, making it perfect for the Oscars. 

However, some critics might say she's played it a little safe, as the style is similar to her low twist chignon from last year's Oscars.

Felicity Jones: Natural, soft bun

Felicty Jones' natural bun worked in favour of her dramatic dress choice 

She may not have received the best reception for her choice in gown, but her natural soft bun is perfectly in keeping with runway styles for this spring and summer.

Women that are wearing dresses with a high neckline want to embrace effortless, textured hair, as it avoids distracting too much from the dress.

Rosamond Pike: Textured knotted 'un-do'

Rosamund Pike won best hair in Matthew Curtis' books with her take on the Grecian up-do

Rosamond's look is without a doubt my favourite from this year's Oscars red carpet. It's a stunning transition from the overly done Grecian up-do, which we see far too often on the red carpet, into a more textured, knotted un-do. 

The texture running through the front of the hair keeps the style soft and elegant, allowing the knot at the back to be a little tighter.

Gina Rodriguez: Off-balance chignon

Matthew wasn't keen on Gina's play-it-safe chignon as he says it has been overly set

Gina's hair is a play-safe chignon that hasn't quite gone to plan. The style for me is a little off balance to the one side and overly set. 

The look could have been made a little softer and elegant if there was more texture running through the front. with the bun positioned towards the nape of the neck. 

Unfortunately, for me, her deep blue gown and hair do not work together to create that wow factor we so want from the red carpet.

Margot Robbie: On-trend sleek LOB

Margot Robbie's LOB (Long Bob) wins points in the trend stakes 

This year already we've seen so many celebrity icons revamping their look from long styles to the on-trend, effortless LOB (Long Bob) - Rosie Huntington-Whitely and Kim Kardashian to name a few. 

Margot has worn this style straight with a deep side parting, keeping her look sophisticated and stunning, so that her natural beauty and her gorgeous red dress make the statement.

Dakota Johnson: Simply pony

Dakota Johnson's simple pony tail was a bit of a let down at her first big awards ceremony 

Wearing a simple ponytail can always be a risk at such a big awards ceremony. Although it's a versatile style, and one which is timeless, with so much anticipation about her red carpet arrival, could Dakota's look have been too simple this year? 

Opting for a straight pony, this look gives a nod to the Nineties' poker-straight trend that we are seeing more and more of.

I like that she has kept the look delicate and feminine by simply wrapping a thin piece of hair around the elastic - a style which is easy to re-create at home and can be worn as a day look or straight out for dinner.

Marion Cotillard: Effortless low bun

This look may look effortless but works well for awards seasons as it keeps the eye focused on the dress

A beautiful take a on a red carpet hair style which works well for the awards season, but also follows this seasons trend of a simple hair-up with a twist. 

The deep side parting, effortlessly twisted into a gorgeous low bun at the nape of the neck, complements the high line of Marion's white dress.

Julianne Moore: Classic chignon

The chignon is always a favourite on the red carpet and one that is pretty fail safe

A great sleek chignon that's almost as timeless as the ponytail. This is a classic hairstyle that will always be red carpet worthy – Julianne's looks absolutely perfect for the red carpet.

Naomi Watts: Nonchalant textured LOB

Naomi Watts gave the LOB an updated textured feel with her beachy waves

Also embracing the LOB, Naomi's Oscar style is such a wearable look that we will be seeing a lot more of in the world of film and fashion. 

Rather than wearing it sleek like Margot Robbie, Naomi's LOB has a nonchalant, textured feel to it. This look is super easy to re-create at home, using a curling wand on the mid-lengths of the hair, but leaving out the ends for a more lived-in feel.

Sienna Miller: Twisted un-do

Sienna Miller's un-do is not to try hard but achieves an elegant finish 

A simple but stunning and effective look. Sienna's beautifully twisted un-do, that's not overly polished, works perfectly with her Oscar de la Renta dress.

Cate Blanchett: Grecian chignon

The textured Grecian look is a messier take on the classic red carpet chignon

A little too Grecian with the hair, but still working towards an on-trend, textured chignon, Cate is looking incredible as always. 

There is always a high expectation for Cate's red carpet look and she doesn't really ever get much wrong.

Gwyneth Paltrow: Straight, slicked back

Matthew wasn't madly keen on Gwyneth Paltrow's 90s look as he believe it did not flatter the dress

Although Gwyneth is working the natural Nineties sleek and slicked back look, I don't feel this style complements her dress.

A better look would had been a simple low twisted bun or ponytail, so that focus is on the detail of the dress.

Reese Witherspoon: Confused hair

Matthew was not impressed with Reese Witherspoon's hair as he says it didn't look styled or natural

For me Reese has got it spot on with the dress, yet her hair doesn't seem to know whether it's supposed to be 'un-done' or 'done'.

It's neither styled nor natural. If she hadn't gone for such a strong centre parting, but more of a deep side part, it would have given the look a softer and effortless feel which would have worked better for her.
