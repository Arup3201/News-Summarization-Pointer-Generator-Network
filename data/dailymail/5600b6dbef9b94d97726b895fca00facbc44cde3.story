Sales of English apples are set to hit a 20-year high - pipping demand for imports.

The boom in favourites, including Gala, Braeburn, Cox and Russet, was fuelled by good weather, which boosted production, and increased availability in supermarkets.

Ironically, the rise of apples grown in the UK has stemmed from the fact we are planting large numbers of foreign varieties, particularly Braeburn and Gala, which originated in New Zealand.

Traditional English apples like Cox may have a superior taste, however the likes of Braeburn are easier to grow, producing more fruit per tree and are more likely to meet the EU’s designated ‘Class 1’ status.

The Cox’s Orange Pippin can trace its heritage back to 1830, at Colnbrook in Buckinghamshire, England, where it was developed by the retired brewer and horticulturist Richard Cox.

By contrast the Braeburn is a much more modern variety. It is believed to have originated from a cross between a Granny Smith and Lady Hamilton and was discovered as a chance seedling in 1952 by a farmer in the Moutere Hills, New Zealand.

The first Gala was a cross between the Golden Delicious and the Kidd’s Orange Red and was planted in New Zealand in the 1930s and is now grown across the globe.

New research shows that this season’s sales of English-grown apples reached 92,700 tonnes at the end of January, a significant increase on the 75,000 tonnes sold at the same point last year.

The rise in demand and sales was announced by Adrian Barlow, head of the industry body English Apples and Pears, who expects total sales of the 2014 crop to hit 130,000 tonnes – up by 15,000 on the year before.

The boom in favourites, including Gala, Braeburn, Cox and Russet, was fuelled by good weather, which boosted production, and increased availability 

In 2003 just 23 per cent of apples sold here came from British orchards, however this is now up to more than 30per cent and the industry is aiming for 65 per cent.

Mr Barlow said a tactical decision by growers to switch to producing apples that originated overseas has been a huge factor in the industry’s growth, describing the transformation as ‘electrifying’.

He said sales of UK produced Gala apples were up by 7,900 tonnes on last year’s figures, rising to 29,600 tonnes by the end of January. Such is demand that the 2014 English crop is expected to be sold out by April.

Mr Barlow told The Grocer magazine: ‘We have recovered the ground lost by the shortages in the crop we saw in 2012 and 2013.’

While English growers are selling more, the total number of apples sold in the UK is showing signs of decline. Total consumption in 2014 was 482,000 tonnes, which was down by 9per cent on the 527,000 in 2011.

Growers attribute this to the rising competition from fast food, sweets and other snacks. They also complain the government’s healthy eating advice to consume five portions of fruit or vegetables a day is being ignored, with the current average put at three.

Mr Barlow said: ‘Shoppers should recognise that English apples are good both for them, local economies and the environment. There really is an English apple for everyone and due to our climate, they are the best in world.’

Despite the bumper harvest, he said apple growers are disappointed with the price they are being paid for their crop.

British growers generally receive about 15 per cent more than their European counterparts for apples destined for the fruit bowl. By contrast, some who supply the juicing and processing market have experienced a ‘torrid time’ due to low prices.

Particularly true for Braeburn and Gala, which originated in New Zealand
