Darren Scott, 26, allegedly attacked his flatmate with a kitchen knife midway through a massage at his luxury Mayfair flat, a court has heard

A psychology graduate was 'possessed' when he stabbed his friend at his Mayfair apartment and told him to 'stand still I need to finish the job.' 

Darren Scott, 26, is said to have inflicted 21 injuries after plunging a kitchen knife in to his victim's neck during a massage as rap music blared in the background.

The Old Bailey heard Scott, who denies charges including attempted murder, screamed as the victim locked himself in the en-suite bathroom.

Scott, a graduate from Hull university, is accused of carrying out the attack at the victim's plush three-storey apartment on July 3 last year – leaving the master bedroom soaked in blood.

The horrified victim, an art curator who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said he was sure he had been murdered. 

He said Scott, who he had only known for two weeks, had confessed to enjoying kinky bondage games in the past and had become 'intimidating' the day before the attack. 

He became weary of Scott's wide-eyed stare and told friends he feared he was a 'psychopath, he said. 

Giving evidence, he said Scott started looking for a vein in his neck after offering to give his new friend a massage.  

Midway through, Scott said he was going to get some salt water from the kitchen, the court heard. 

He then allegedly told his friend to lie on his back and put a T-shirt over his face, before changing the soothing music to 'quite loud and angry' sounds.  

He then pulled out the knife and started stabbing him repeatedly, the court heard. 

'Darren was not doing much, he was rubbing mainly my chest and I was very aware that, unlike what he was doing on my back, he was not doing anything significant other than rubbing close to my neck and the upper part of my chest, only with his left hand', he said.

'I became very anxious that Darren was just buying time, rubbing my neck and not doing much. I had a bad gut feeling.

'I distinctly remember listening to the lyrics of the music as thought there was something bad going on.'

He said Scott then tapped his neck "like a nurse looking for a vein".

'I froze and thought there was something not right, in fact there was something dangerous', he added.

'I don't know how long it went on for but I felt there was something sinister. By that time, Darren had put his knees on my arms so I was locked under him.' 

He told the court Scott had confessed to enjoying kinky bondage massages with past partners, and had a rope and handcuffs with him in his bag. 

The court heard Scott moved in to the Mayfair flat just a day after they met in July last year.

But within a few days his host started to suspect Scott was taking advantage of his hospitality. 

He said he was preparing to tell Scott to leave but allowed him to give him a massage as he had slept badly the night before.

He continued: 'In a flash, Darren's body moved and as soon as his body moved I turned myself away from Darren's right.

'Darren struck me, not where he was tapping, but here, below my ear. I knew Darren had stabbed me.

'I managed to throw Darren off my body and the next thing I remember I was fighting off the knife in the middle of the room.

'Darren stabbed me repeatedly around the same area of my neck. I fought with my arms and kept Darren off me.'

The victim said he struggled to stay on his feet due to the amount of blood pouring from his wounds on to the floor.

'Within a short amount of time, a great deal of blood had already splashed out of me', he said.

'When I got up there were repeated blows from the knife. I was simply trying to stop Darren from getting the knife into me.'  

'Darren was like a possessed, vicious man who was staring in my eyes, telling me: "What did you think this was all about - stand still I need to finish the job", he said.

'When Darren first moved to strike, I think he made a sound. I can't remember if these sounds are in my head or I heard them.

'Darren was using his left hand, trying to put his fingers into my neck wounds and rip them open them with his hand as he was striking with the other one and I was shouting "murder"'. 

But he managed to struggle free and lock himself in the en-suite bathroom, while he had blood gushing from his neck. 

'I was sure that I had been murdered and I had a very short time to live', he told jurors.

'The only thought I had in my mind was why I had been so patient, and that I had a gut feeling - an uncomfortable gut feeling - and I had been too patient.

'I was now dying because I had been murdered, these are the last minutes of my life and this is how my life has come to an end.' 

The court heard Scott eventually let the injured man call for an ambulance after he had barricaded himself in the bathroom and he received emergency treatment to his injuries.    

Scott was later arrested while socialising in a jazz bar in Brough, near Hull.

The court heard he had used his alleged victim's bank card to pay for the £280 train fare. 

After he had moved in to the luxury apartment, Scott began taking pictures of the apartment and sending them to his friends, claiming it was paid for by his new employers Procter and Gamble, the court was told.

But it later emerged Scott had forged documents, falsely claiming that he worked for the company. 

Another document showed a £420,000 payment into a bank account that did not exist, the court was told.

Scott also allegedly used his new friend’s bank card to go on a £1,700 spending spree at House of Fraser. 

Scott, of no fixed address, denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud.

He has admitted a second count of fraud over the House of Fraser shopping.

The trial continues.
