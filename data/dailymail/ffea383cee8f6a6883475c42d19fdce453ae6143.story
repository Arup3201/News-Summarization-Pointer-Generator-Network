A grandmother-of-five quite literally danced a jig of delight after realising she had scooped $40million on the lottery - rather than the $40,000 she thought she had won.

Maria Carreiro, 51, only realised she had become a millionaire after her daughter went online to double-check what the jackpot was on Canada's Lotto Max.

Ms Carreiro, of Toronto, said she plans to use some of her vast winnings to take a holiday in Hawaii - but that she first wanted to enjoy a meal in a local buffet restaurant with her family.

Shocked: Canadian grandmother-of-five Maria Carreiro only realised she had won $40million on the lottery after her daughter double-checked the jackpot

Excitement: Mrs Carreiro, of Toronto, said she ran back to the shop where she bought the ticket 'like a crazy woman' to double check

Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation
identified Ms Carreira as the winner of last Friday’s Lotto Max jackpot draw.

She told the media that she was delighted when she thought she had won just $40,000 and that she had excitedly told her daughter about her luck.

But later her daughter double checked the jackpot on the internet and told her she had actually won tens of millions.

'I run up the stairs, and me and her run down the stairs, and she went on the computer. and said, 'Mommy, you're $40 million richer,' and I said, 'No way,' ABC News reported Ms Carreira as saying.

Plans: She said she wanted to spend part of her winnings on a holiday in Hawaii - but that first of all she wanted to visit a local buffet restaurant with her family

Lucky: Mrs Carreiro gave an animated performance when celebrating her winnings in front of the media

She told the media that she had run 
back to the store 'like a crazy woman' where she bought the ticket to 
check it for a second time.

When
asked what her immediate plans were she said: 'I am going to go for 
dinner with my whole family at The Mandarin [buffet chain], all you can 
eat!,' CBS News reports.

'That’s what I'm going to do and then I am going to go home, take a shower and go to sleep.'
