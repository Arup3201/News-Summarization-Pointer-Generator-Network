Missing schoolgirl Chloe Newman has been found after disappearing 10 days ago

Missing schoolgirl Chloe Newman has been found safe and well after disappearing 10 days ago.

The 14-year-old is understood to have contacted police herself after seeing an appeal for her whereabouts.

The youngster, from Uckfield, East Sussex, was found at an address in Newhaven, East Sussex, this evening.

Police had been treating Chloe as a 'high risk missing person' due to her age, the length of time she has been missing and the fact that she has been associating with older people.

Yesterday, three people - a 33-year-old woman, a boy of 16 and a 22-year-old man - were arrested on suspicion of child abduction yesterday.

All three were from the Newhaven area.

The trio were questioned and then released on police bail until April 11.

The last confirmed sighting of the teenager was of her getting into a black car at Haywards Heath railway station in West Sussex at 2.50pm on January 7.

Superintendent Laurence Taylor said: 'Chloe has got in touch with us tonight and officers are talking to her to find out where she has been over the last 10 days.

'I'd like to thank the public and the media for helping us find her.'

Several people had told police they think they may have seen 
her since January 7, but none of the sightings were confirmed.
