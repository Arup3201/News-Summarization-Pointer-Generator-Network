Everton have made a bid to rival Swansea and West Ham for Muhamed Besic of Ferencvaros.

Manager Roberto Martinez has offered £2.5m plus add ons for the 21-year-old Bosnian midfielder who impressed at the World Cup.

Swansea have made an offer totalling £4m while West Ham are monitoring developments.

Attracting interest: Muhamed Besic is wanted by a string of Premier League clubs

Versatile: Besic can play in defence or midfield

Besic, who represented the chance to represent Germany at youth level in order to play for Bosnia-Herzegovina U21s in 2010, can also play at centre-back.

The 21-year-old played in all three of Bosnia-Herzegovina's World Cup games, as Safet Susic's side bowed out after the group stages.

Born in Berlin, Besic began his career with Hamburg, though disciplinary problems limited his opportunities at the Bundesliga club.

In 2012 he moved to Ferencvaros and in his first season at the club helped them finish fifth in the Hungarian top division.

Rare chance: Besic struggled to nail down a first-team spot at Hamburg because of disciplinary issues
