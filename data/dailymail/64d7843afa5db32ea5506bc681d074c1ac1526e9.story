Home Secretary Theresa May donned a lucky pair of Union Jack pumps to watch Mo Farah bid for golden glory at the Olympic Stadium tonight.

Mrs May last wore the sparkling red, white and blue shoes when she watched Team GB bring home three golds in 45 minutes on its most successful day in modern Olympic history last weekend.

Embracing the Olympic spirit, Mrs May said: 'I thought I would show a bit of patriotic spirit and get behind Team GB, which the public have been doing in a magnificent way.
