An aborted theatre tour of the cult Sky Sports programme Soccer Saturday is still the subject of legal action more than two years after four shows were cancelled.

Entertainer Mike Osman, a close friend of Soccer Saturday regular Matt Le Tissier, arranged the abandoned roadshow. He continues to pursue presenter Jeff Stelling for breach of contract.

Osman claims to have lost £250,000 after dates in Liverpool, Newcastle, London and Birmingham were cancelled following successful shows in Southampton and Bournemouth. It is claimed ticket sales suffered after Stelling failed to fulfil promises to promote the show.

It is believed the marathon legal row has strained relationships on the programme, with Osman also said to have contracts in place with Phil Thompson, Charlie Nicholas and Paul Merson, as well as Le Tissier. 

Osman said: ‘These things take a long time to resolve but I’m not giving up.’ 

Sky Sports are aware of the dispute but say they are not involved, even though the roadshow used the official Soccer Saturday brand.

Mark Clattenburg has not taken charge of a Premier League fixture since October 25

Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg looks still to be paying the price for going in his own car to an Ed Sheeran concert after a match — and taking a call from manager Neil Warnock en route — rather than leaving in the official transport. 

Clattenburg, a Champions League referee and widely regarded as one of the best in England, was stood down for one match at the time. But he was on Championship duty last weekend, then relegated further to fourth official in midweek and next Saturday.

The conspiracy theory is that referees’ chief Mike Riley favours other elite officials, including Michael Oliver, who received no reprimand after his fiancee Lucy May travelled in the officials’ vehicle this season. A source said Oliver asked permission.

MCC have appointed Gerald Corbett to succeed Oliver Stocken as chairman next October. 

Corbett, who had a torrid time as CEO of Railtrack, has chaired six public companies including Britvic and Betfair. But even though he has been an MCC member since 1995, he has not served on any of the Lord’s committees that would have given him some knowledge of the lunatic fringe who have disrupted the ground renovation.

Corbett, whose cricket career peaked when he beat the Westerleigh prep school bowling record of F1 legend James Hunt, said: ‘I’m used to arriving from planet Mars but getting my feet under the table pretty quickly.’

Ticketmaster have given assurances about the sale of 2015 Rugby World Cup tickets

Ticketmaster, who are supply partners with England Rugby 2015, have given assurances about not selling Rugby World Cup tickets on their controversial online secondary sites. But that didn’t stop Ticketmaster-owned Get Me In offloading a counterfeit pair of VIP tickets for the Chisora-Fury boxing show last Saturday for £5,000, with the unfortunate buyers stopped at the gate.

Robertson on Coe team

Former Minister for Sport Sir Hugh Robertson will be part of Lord Coe’s campaign team in his bid for the IAAF presidency.

Robertson’s know-how from his spell in the Foreign Office with responsibility for the Middle East and North Africa will be utilised to unlock doors in the chase for more than 200 votes. Sir Hugh has yet to decide whether to stand for his Faversham and Mid Kent seat at the General Election next year, but currently has time on his hands to be of significant help to Coe.

However, the biggest diplomatic issue for Coe might be keeping the peace between his two warring communications and strategic chiefs Jackie Brock-Doyle, a close adviser over London 2012, and bid specialist Mike Lee, who runs Coe’s PR for the IAAF presidency. It’s safe to say Lee and Brock-Doyle, who surprisingly attended the Lee-organised launch of Coe’s manifesto, do not like each other.

Spurs, who already have an influential female board presence in combative executive director Donna Cullen, have chosen QPR finance chief Rebecca Caplehorn to replace MLS-bound Darren Eales as director of football administration.
