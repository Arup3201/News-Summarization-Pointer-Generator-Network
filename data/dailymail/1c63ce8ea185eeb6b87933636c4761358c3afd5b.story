A two-year-old girl may have a bald patch for life after a toy train ripped out a patch of her hair.  

Lilly Brokenshire was playing with the plastic 'Toot-Toot' locomotive, which was advertised as being suitable for children aged 12 months or older.  

But the motorised toy became tangled in her hair and ripped out a three-inch patch from the middle of her head - leading her father to fear that it may never grow back.  

Now the company which makes the train has been forced to issue a fresh warning about the dangers of children getting hair or clothes trapped in their toys. 

Ordeal: Lilly Brokenshire had a large patch of hair pulled out by a toy train made by Chinese firm VTech

Fears: The two-year-old could be left with a permanent bald patch in the wake of the accident

The toddler's father Paul Jacob, from Crawley in West Sussex, urged other parents to be wary of the Toot-Toot Drivers Train, made by Chinese electronics giant VTech.  

The Â£49.99 toy train set comes with a 32-piece winding track, signals and toy buildings, as well as the motorised train and a cargo car. 

'We got Lilly the train for Christmas,' said Mr Jacob, 37. 'She has all the other VTech train toys, so we got her this one, the first motorised one they've made.  

'I was sat next to her when she was happily playing with it, but before I knew what was going on, she had picked the plastic train from the track and ran it on top of her head.  

'The wheels took her hair and kept wrapping it around the wheels, pulling it out by the roots and leaving part of her head scalped.' 

Torn out: This large clump of hair was caught in the wheels of the motorised toy locomotive

Danger: The firm that makes the train has now issued a new warning against getting hair or clothes caught

Mr Jacob, a chef, said that because Lilly is so young the accident earlier this month could have permanently damaged the growth of her hair.  

'She could be bald there now for the rest of her life,' he said. 'If her hair doesn't start growing soon, we'll know that it probably won't ever come back.  

'The hair was ripped clean from the roots and follicles. It is very powerful - I've placed it in the palm of my hand and you can feel the wheels and motor grinding.  

'It is clearly a danger when young toddlers are playing with it.' 

Warning: Lilly's father Paul has demanded that VTech issue a recall of the train

The toy came with a disclaimer advising parents not allow their children to remove the train from its tracks, but did not mention the risk posed by the motor, according to Mr Jacob.  

He has called for VTech to implement a recall of the set and install an emergency cut-off feature to stop similar incidents in future.  

A spokesman for the company said: 'The VTech Toot-Toot Drivers Train has been tested to European safety standards and has passed all tests for children over 12 months of age.  

'VTech aims to go above and beyond the standards required in the European tests and, as such, we have added a leaflet within the Toot-Toot Driver Train Station packaging which contains a warning about only playing with the train on the track and not close to hair, body or clothes.'
