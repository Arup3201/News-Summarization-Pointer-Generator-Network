Chelsea Clinton got in some practice ahead of the birth of her first child as she played with kids at a New York City event today.

The former first daughter, whose baby is due in the fall, looked relaxed and healthy as she showed off her growing baby bump beneath a loose-fitting dress and red necklace at the event on Friday.

She chatted with youngsters at the Riverbank State Park in Harlem and admired the paper crowns they were wearing as part of Disney Junior's 'Pirate and Princess: Power of Doing Good' tour.

Ms Clinton appeared on the stage as part of the tour early on Friday morning so she could speak to the children about the importance of carrying out community service.

Stepping out: It comes a week after she celebrated her baby shower in Chappaqua, New York with her family

Hillary Clinton hosted the event at Crabtree's Kittle House, an upscale restaurant near the Clintons' estate in Chappaqua, New York, on July 13, according to the New York Daily News.

But due to Chelsea's wheat intolerance, the menu was 99 per cent gluten-free - as was the cake at her 2010 wedding to Marc Mezvinsky.

One witness said former President Bill Clinton made an appearance and 'worked the room', while Chelsea's husband was also in attendance.

The couple
 announced that they are expecting their first child during a Clinton 
Foundation event devoted to empowering young women at New York's Lower 
East Side Girls Club on April 17.

She
 told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child 
arriving later this year... I just hope that I will be as good a mom to 
my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.'

Parents to be: Chelsea and Marc Mezvinsky, who married in 2010, will welcome their first child this fallÂ
