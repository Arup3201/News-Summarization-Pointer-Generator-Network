A New York State police officer has been suspended after a video was posted online capturing him allegedly slapping a young man he had pulled over.

The driver did not want to have his car searched by the officer who had spotted a rifle on the back seat and so a standoff ensued during which time the cop became extremely agitated.

The video was captured by the drivers' friend who was sitting in the passenger seat of the car throughout the encounter. 

Caught on camera: A New York sheriff's deputy has been suspended after a video captured him cursing at a young man and apparently slapping him

Slap happy: The strike can be heard but isn't seen. The deputy then tells the friend he could 'rip your ... head off.'

Sgt. Shawn R. Glans, 48, who has been a police officer for 27 years, was suspended without pay pending an internal investigation.  

His superior Sheriff Michael Zurlo on Saturday said he was 'very disturbed' by what he saw on the video.

'I really am,' the sheriff said. 'I don't condone activity as it's portrayed and we're going to look into it and we'll handle this quickly and swiftly.'

Sgt. Glans confronted the pair on Friday in the sleepy town of Half Moon.

The men were walking back to their car when the officer noticed a .22-caliber rifle in the rear.

The sergeant said they were wearing dark clothes and acting suspiciously, although they broke no laws.

As the young man questions the deputy's intention to search the car, the officer replies, 'We'll get a f****** search warrant.'

In trouble: 48-year-old Sgt. Shawn Glans was suspended Saturday over the encounter Friday in the town of Halfmoon

Recorded: It shows Glans cursing at the young man and insisting that he has a right to search a vehicle. The deputy also apparently slaps the young man; the strike can be heard but isn't seen

'I wasn't in my car when all this was happening,' the young man says. 'Like, why don't you want to search, like, my house or something?'

The sergeant becomes frustrated as he asks to see the man's keys. 

'Why?' the young man asks. 'You can't do that.'

'Because we're searching your f****** car, that's why,' Glans says.

The deputy then apparently slaps the young man as he says: 'You want to (expletive) resist?' 

The sound of the slap can be heard but is not captured on the video because the camera was pointing away from the action. 

It's unclear from the video if another deputy is involved.

Glans then tells the young man, who remains calm throughout the ordeal, that 'if you've got nothing to hide in there ... we'll be on our (expletive) merry way.'

Smirk: The young man's friend filmed the encounter. Saratoga County Sheriff Michael Zurlo calls the video disturbing

The driver's friend who is filming the incident throughout tells the sergeant that what just happened was 'intense' and asks the officer if he's going hit him next. 

The sheriff's sergeant responds that he could 'rip your f****** head off and s*** down your neck'

'You like that, huh? I can get a lot more intense,' the sergeant tells the young man.

'You saw the video. It doesn't look good,' Glans told the Times Union. 'I'm all about doing the right thing. I had to go to that point because of the factors that came into play. There was a gun that was involved (that) I spotted in the vehicle.'

He acknowledged that he did not know the incident was being videotaped.

'I was concerned. It was a public safety issue,' the sergeant said. 'If I had to do it all over again ... I'd probably do the same thing. If I knew the camera was there, no, because it does look bad.'

The young man who filmed the incident said they parked their car at the business and walked to a nearby party. 

They had purchased a .22-caliber rifle earlier that day and had a receipt for the weapon.

They were finally let go after showing the deputy the receipt. 

It's not the first time the Sergeant has had a brush with the law he is supposed to uphold. 

In 1999, the town of Wilton, Saratoga County paid $6 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of a 45-year-old man left paralyzed when a patrol car being driven by Glans smashed head-on into the other car.

Douglas H. McEachron suffered critical brain injuries and a federal jury found Glans was negligent in the crash.

The deputy was responding to a 911 call and driving close to three times the posted speed limit around a sharp curve on Smith Bridge Road in Wilton when he lost control of his vehicle.

Glans crossed into the oncoming lane and smashed head-on into McEachron's car.
