Severe turbulence caused injuries to seven people aboard United Flight 15 as the plane headed towards Honolulu on Saturday, officials said.

Rain and winds up to 60 mph buffeted the Hawaiian islands over the weekend, causing trouble for at least six other flights, though all landed without incident.

NBC News reports that 'sudden turbulence' affected the inbound United Flight, injuring seven, five of whom were transported to the hospital.

Four crew members were taken to the hospital, along with a teenage girl with a head injury and nausea. 

The other flights were set to arrive in Maui, but had to be rerouted to Honolulu due to poor weather, according to the Hawaii Department of Transportation.

Hawaii News Now reports that the islands of Oahu and Kauai were under a high wind warning up until Sunday, with wind gusts of 59 mph reported in parts of the state.

On Friday, 2,000 residents of Temple Valley, Punaluu, and Kaneohe had lost power due to the storm.

Authorities from the Honolulu Fire Department also noted blown roofs, downed trees and reports of downed power lines caused by severe wind.

'The gutter is being torn apart off of our roof and a carport,' said Kaneohe resident, Tanya Fitch. 'I have a huge banana plant I had to support it with ropes and boards and stuff so it doesn't fall over and get snapped. It's just been bad really bad.'

A firefighter was reportedly taken to Queen's Medical Center in serious condition with back and hip injuries, after being caught by wind while repairing a blown roof.

While on the roof, a gust blew a tarp that had been laid down, carrying the firefighter into the air and dropping him back onto the roof.
