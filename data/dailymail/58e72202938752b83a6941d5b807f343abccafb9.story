A man who beat his father to death with a baseball bat and left his mother and brother for dead has asked for forgiveness from his family and God in an emotional speech in court.

Tucker Cipriano, 20, had admitted murdering his father Robert and severely injuring mother Rose and brother Salvatore in a midnight drug-fuelled attack.

Speaking from the dock as he was sentenced to life in prison, Cipriano spoke to the public gallery and asked for forgiveness.

Regretful? Tucker Cipriano, 20, broke into tears as he described remorse for having brutally attacked his father, his mother and his brother with a baseball bat

Jailed: Tucker Cipriano made an emotional speech to the court about his 'great dad' and 'amazing mom' as he was given a life sentence for attacking them

'I stand before the people of the court, 
the media, my family and friends, but mostly God, asking forgiveness and
confessing my sins,' he said, the Detroit Free Press reported.

He described his parents as 'a great 
dad' and an 'amazing mom', adding that he remembered refusing to let go 
of his mother's hand on his first day of school.

He said: 'Mom, I wish I would have never let go.'

Cipriano also told the courtroom he 
loved his father and he hoped that his guilty plea was what his father 
would have 'wanted me to do'. 

His mother and brothers and sister 
were not at court, although some extended family members cried in the 
gallery as he spoke, the newspaper reported.

His co-defendant Mitchell Young, 21, 
furiously denied the charges and said he had been the victim of a 
'strong miscarriage of justice'.

Both men were given mandatory life sentences.

Convicted accomplice Mitchell Young also expressed regret in court, sobbing during his statement before sentencing. He was also sentenced to life in prison

Accused: Young, left, allegedly helped his friend Tucker Cipriano, right, bludgeon his father to death and seriously injure Cipriano's mother and younger brother after breaking in to their home at night

Young helped Cipriano, 20, bludgeon his father Robert, 52, to death on April 16, 2012 after breaking into the family home, where Cipriano no longer lived.

They also left his mother Rose,
51, and brother Salvatore, 18, with life-threatening injuries, while 
his eight-year-old sister Isabella watched helplessly in their 
Farmington Hills, Michigan home.

Witnesses, including Farmington Hills
Sgt. Richard Wehby, testified how Young repeatedly asked whether or not
he was in trouble, the Detroit Free Press reported.

Young
allegedly told Wehby that Tucker 'went crazy', killed his father and 
beat his brother with a baseball bat, and initially denied being part of
the attack, claiming that Tucker had also hit him.

But
he changed his story after the little girl told officers she had seen 
Young take part in the attack and when investigators noted he had 
inconsistencies in his story.

'The story changed... on who drove to 
the scene, how they made entry into the residence, bits and pieces that 
were never mentioned,' Wehby said.

He allegedly told investigators that he had 
only hit Rose 'one or two times' in the head with a bat.

Dr. Eric McDowell, from Botsford 
Hospital, said Tucker's brother Salvatore was barely alive when he arrived at hospital and doctors 
contacted an organ donation service as he was so critically injured.

Plea: Tucker Cipriano put on a rosary before pleading no contest to accusations of murder

He had multiple skull fractures, multiple facial bone fractures and swelling and bleeding on his brain.

Rose Cipriano also had skull and 
facial bone fractures and bleeding in her brain and Dr. McDowell, who 
said he regularly deals with assault cases, said: 'This is certainly by far the worst that I've seen.'

The testimony came after Assistant
Prosecutor John Skrzynski supplied jury members with graphic photos of 
the bloody crime scene, showing blood splatted across surfaces 
throughout the home.

He also showed Mitchell Young's pants, which were splattered with blood.

The two men had been smoking a synthetic marijuana called K2 and broke into the house in search of money for drugs.

Robert heard a noise and, dressed only in his underwear, 
found the pair downstairs in the kitchen, according to court documents.

He told them to leave but Cipriano used the bat to attack him. Rosemary, who had followed her husband down the stairs, pleaded with him to stop.

Cipriano is then said to have handed 
Young the weapon and told him to 'keep his mother quiet'. He allegedly 
struck her in the head.

Salvatore then tried to stop the pair with his pellet gun, but was overpowered and beaten with both the gun and the bat.

Court documents obtained by the Free 
Press revealed how Isabella, who woke in the middle of the night to the 
sound of screaming, walked downstairs to see Young battering her mother 
with a bat.

Cipriano, who was watching the attack, 
told her go upstairs. She returned, in a bid to save her mother, with 
her multi-coloured softball bat.

Break-in: The attack took place at Bob Cipriano's home in Farmington Hills, Michigan

But
instead of stopping his friend, he seized the bat and started to smash 
his mother and brother to within an inch of their lives.

Tanner, Salvatore's twin, hid in a nearby bedroom and called 911 - hiding in a closet when Cipriano came looking for him.

Farmington Hills police testified how they found a blood-soaked Young at the home. Cipriano fled before he was arrested several hours later.

'I got him on the ground [and another 
officer] puts handcuffs on [Young],' Officer Eric Buckberry testified. 'He 
had blood in his hands, on the front of his shirt, things like that.'

Officers testified Young was shaking, crying and hysterical following the attack.

Police statements said the scene was 'ghastly', with blood spattered on the refrigerator, cabinets and ceiling.

Young 
reportedly told police Cipriano 'wanted to break into his parents' house 
because he wanted to get money, his personal belongings and anything of 
value'.

Cipriano pleaded no contest to first-degree felony murder. He will spend the 
rest of his life in prison.
