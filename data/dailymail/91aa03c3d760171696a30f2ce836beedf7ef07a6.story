Wondering if that glass of wine has pushed you over the driving limit?

Now a tiny breathalyser that plugs into a mobile phone has been developed, allowing people to test the alcohol content of their blood before getting into the car.

The DrinkMate plugs into Android smartphones and displays a person's Blood Alcohol Content.

DrinkMate is a breathalyser that is powered by a smartphone. Its developers claim it is the 'smallest breathalyser in the world' and claim it is accurate to 0.001 per cent Blood Alcohol Content (BAC)

DrinkMate works by being plugged into an Android phone, following the app’s instructions to blow into it, and then BAC results will be displayed within a fraction of a second.

BAC gives the percentage of alcohol in the blood in order to measure alcohol intoxication - for example, the UK drink drive limit is 0.08 per cent BAC.

In the U.S., the limit is also 0.08 per cent. However in people with a BAC of 0.05 per cent or above, some states may apply a lesser charge - sometimes referred to as 'driving while ability impaired'. 

In Australia, the legal limit is 0.05 per cent.  

DrinkMate's U.S. developers claim it is the smallest breathalyser available on the market and is accurate to approximately 0.001 per cent BAC.   

The maximum alcohol reading the device can measure is 0.20 per cent BAC - a level where there is the possibility of falling unconscious.

The company claims the accuracy was validated using testing and calibration kits from Lifeloc Technologies, a manufacturer of professional breath testers.

However it has not been tested by independent authorities.

The device works by being plugged into an Android phone. Users then follow the app’s instructions to blow into it.

The results are then displayed 'within a fraction of a second'.

However the developers recommended users wait between 15 and 20 minutes after their last drink before testing their blood alcohol reading.  

Smoking or eating during this time could also affect the reading. 

The device - which measures 1.7 inches in length and 0.62 inches in diameter - is so small because it has no internal battery. 

Instead, power is supplied from the Android phone via the micro-USB port.

The developers - Shaun Masavage, an electromechanical engineer, and Mack Redding, an engineer, physicist and app develope - claim the energy used to power the breathalyser is negligible for short periods of time on any phone.

They are using Kickstarter so that they can take a large quantity of orders at once, lowering manufacturing costs.

An iPhone version is not currently available, but may be developed depending on the success of the Android version.

The UK drink drive limit is 0.08 per cent BAC, and developers say DrinkMate measures up to 0.20 per cent BAC, a level of intoxication at which loss of consciousness is possible
