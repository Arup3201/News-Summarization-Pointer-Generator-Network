Jilted: Tracey Ann Orton, 42, smashed her car into a building in a jealous rage

A jilted wife caused thousands of pounds of damage after driving into her love rival's home in a jealous rage.

Tracey Ann Orton, 42, who ran a fish and chip shop with her husband Kevin, was furious when she discovered he had moved in with another woman.

Although the pair had separated, she had believed they were going to get back together.

In a fit of rage Orton drove and crashed her car into a garage next to the home of her husband’s new partner, Sarah Carroll.

The crash was so loud pedestrians from nearby Holderness Road ran to see what the commotion was.

Hull Crown Court heard witness Helen Ralph ran to the scene to discover Orton’s car was embedded in an outbuilding.

Orton, from Kingswood, Hull had to be pulled from the wreckage but was uninjured.

The damage to the building was estimated to cost £12,290 and damage to bikes inside the building came to £200.

In the weeks leading up to the crash, Orton, 42, had sent abusive text messages and had confrontations with her former partner.

She has pleaded guilty to destroying property.

Prosecutor Phillip Evans told the court: 'The defendant was married to, and was separated from, a man called Kevin Orton.

'She had not come to terms with it and shortly after he started a relationship with Sarah Carroll.

'This led in the past to abusive text messages and personal confrontations.

'Orton drove her vehicle into the outbuilding and it had to be demolished.

'The building belonged to the owners of the adjacent property. The Mews is where Sarah Carroll lives and her property is adjacent to this building.

'We say Orton was making an unwelcome gesture towards Carroll.'

Orton’s barrister, Claire Holmes, claimed the crash on March 8 was an accident but this was dismissed by the judge.

She said: 'There was a dispute between them about what had happened previously.

'The reason she was driving in this way was is because she had just learnt Mr Orton was living there with his new partner. That came as a surprise to her as she was under the impression, just a few days before, that a reconciliation was perhaps possible, even likely.

'In that emotional state she drove to where he was to have some form of verbal confrontation.

'In that emotional state she lost control of her car.

'She doesn’t accept it was a deliberate accident out of malice to send a message to anyone.'

The Honorary Recorder of Hull and the East Riding, Judge Mettyear, said: 'Her explanation seems unlikely in the extreme.'

Miss Holmes told the court Orton had now moved on with her life.

She said: 'The damage has been met by her vehicle’s insurance company.

The rebuilding cost has been met by the insurance company also.

'She has made a good deal of progress with her life. She has accepted it and has moved on with her own life and has made progress through counselling.'

Judge Mettyear has given Orton six months to prove she can stay out of trouble before he passes sentence.

He warned her if she was unable to put the relationship behind her she could face jail.

Judge Mettyear said: 'This is a woman of good character.

'She pleaded guilty and was going through an emotional time.

'If she has really put this breakdown behind her then she will not be going to prison.'

He told Orton: 'You committed a serious offence. I don’t like to send people like you to prison but I want to make sure there is no more misbehaviour.

'I’m not going to sentence you yet, but in six months, and put you on trust.

If you stay out of trouble I promise I will not send you away.

'If you get into any more trouble, you might well be at risk. It is up to you.

'Let us see how you behave.'
