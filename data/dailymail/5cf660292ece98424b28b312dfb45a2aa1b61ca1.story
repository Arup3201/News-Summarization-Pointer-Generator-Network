Jack Bernardo spent more than two decades serving his country in the marines and only wanted to come home, but when he finally returned to the fixer-upper he bought in January he discovered something so shocking that he broke down in tears.

His friends had taken the house and given it a complete make-over, giving Bernardo the dream home he always wanted.

'He's
 a pretty emotional guy, so he's... I imagine there will be a lot of 
tears,' friend and fellow former marine Jeremy Epperson told KTVU.

Bernardo's friends and family spent months completely renovating the home before his return from Japan

Epperson hugged his friend upon unveiling the surprise, telling him: 'We did it for you.'

In tears, Bernardo replied, 'I don't deserve this.'

Bernardo and his family came back from being stationed in Okinawa, Japan, Tuesday.

'21 years I gave serving our country, and if I had 21 more years to give, I would,' he said. 'Because I love this country.'

Daughter Jessica said Bernardo bought the house knowing it needed work and she had some doubts.

'At first I was like are you sure you guys want this house,' she said.

Bernardo had asked Epperson to watch the property in their absence.

'I didn't think
 it was right for a person who retired, given 21 years and 50 per cent of
 their pay to come back and spend every cent that they saved on fixing 
up a home,' he said.

Epperson completed the renovation with the help of the Jimmy Doolittle Center as well as numerous contractors and volunteers.

Bernardo only said he wished the honor had gone to someone else

They installed new floors, redid the kitchen, and landscaped.

Suisun city mayor Pete Sanchez even came by the home to give the family a proclamation declaring June 17th, 2014, Master Sgt. Jack Bernardo Day.

Bernardo only said he wished the honor had gone to someone else.

'Those guys that didn't make it in one piece, they deserve this, not me,' he said.
