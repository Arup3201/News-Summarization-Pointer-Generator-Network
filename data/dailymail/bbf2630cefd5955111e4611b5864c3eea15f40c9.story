Jimmy Case believes Liverpool would have been Premier League champions last season had Jamie Carragher not retired.

Brendan Rodgers' side finished just two points adrift of champions Manchester City after slipping up towards the end of the season.

And Liverpool legend Case, who was part of the successful team of the 1970s, is adamant defender and Sportsmail columnist Carragher would have made the difference.

The 60-year-old even insists that Chelsea would not have scored after Steven Gerrard's crucial slip during the 2-0 defeat by the Stamford Bridge club.

Case adds that the presence of Carragher, who retired at the end of the 2012-2013 season, would have prevented them squandering a three-goal to draw 3-3 at Crystal Palace.

The former Liverpool midfielder told theDaily Mirror: 'If Carragher had stayed on for one more season, Liverpool would have won it. He would not have played every game, but the way they lost it against Chelsea and Crystal Palace would not have happened.

'Steven Gerrard might still have slipped against Chelsea, but he would not have been the last man. Carragher would have been covering him and Demba Ba would not have galloped away to score.

'And those three goals in the last 10 minutes at Palace - I know, for a fact, that wouldn't have happened if Jamie had been there to nip it in the bud when the first goal went in. 

'He would have organised it and pulled down the shutters.'
