Israel warned last night that the West should remain on its guard against Iran despite the surprise election of reformist-backed Hassan Rowhani as the country’s new president.

Tens of thousands of chanting supporters filled the streets of Tehran following the landslide victory in joyous scenes a world apart from the violent crackdown on a thwarted people’s uprising four years ago.

Cars honked and blared music ranging from patriotic songs to the Lambada after the triumphant cleric - who studied in Scotland in the 1970s and has a law doctorate from Glasgow Caledonian University - romped home with more than three times the votes of his nearest rival.

But while Britain and the U.S. were cautiously urging Iran to follow through with a more moderate agenda, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted there should be no ‘wishful thinking’ about Mr Rowhani’s election.

‘Iran will be judged on its actions. If it insists on continuing to develop its nuclear programme the answer needs to be clear - stopping its nuclear programme by any means,’ he added.

The newly-elected leader said yesterday that Iran’s dire economic problems can’t be solved ‘overnight.’

After winning over 50 per cent of the vote in Friday’s poll, he said his election was a ‘victory of moderation over extremism.’

One of his key election pledges was to restore relations with Western powers and seek to ease the crippling international sanctions imposed over its nuclear ambitions that have led to ballooning inflation at more than 30 per cent and 14 per cent unemployment.

But in Iran, even landslides at the ballot box do not equate to policymaking influence.

All key decisions - including nuclear 
efforts, defence and foreign affairs - remain solidly in the hands of 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, his ruling clerics and their 
powerful protectors, the Revolutionary Guard.

Although he won’t take power until August, Mr Rowhani took his first steps yesterday in consulting Iran’s clerically dominated establishment on his plans for the future.

What Mr Rowhani’s victory does is reopen space for moderate and liberal voices that have been largely muzzled in reprisal for the massive protests and clashes in 2009 over claims the vote was rigged to deny reformists the presidency.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli PM

The 64 year old is hardly a radical - having served in governments and in the highly sensitive role of nuclear negotiator - but he has taken a strong stance against the combative isolationist international policies of outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

‘I thank God that once again rationality and moderation has shined on Iran,’ he said on state TV at the weekend. ‘This is the victory of wisdom, a victory of moderation and a victory of commitment over extremism.’

His emphasis on outreach could sharply lower the political temperature between Iran and the West - including Israel - and perhaps nudge the ruling establishment toward more flexible approaches in possible renewed nuclear talks with the U.S. and world powers.

Mr Rowhani also has added leverage with 
his political godfather and ally, former President Akbar Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, who was blocked from the ballot but now can exert 
significant influence from the wings.

The White House congratulated Iranian 
voters for ‘their courage in making their voices heard’ despite 
clampdowns that included severe restrictions on the Internet, a key tool
of Iran’s opposition.

Washington urged Tehran’s leadership to ‘heed the will of the Iranian people and make responsible choices,’ while noting the US remained open for direct dialogue with Iran.

Just a week ago, Mr Rowhani - the only cleric in the race - seemed greatly overshadowed by candidates with much deeper ties to the ruling theocracy and Revolutionary Guard.

But he gained momentum: first with 
endorsements from Mr Rafsanjani and another moderate-minded former 
president Mohammad Khatami.

Hassan Rowhani

Then artists, activist and opposition leaders joined. In the span of a few days, Mr Rowhani was drawing huge crowds and the race - once seen as firmly in the control of the ruling system - was suddenly transformed.

Alireza Nader, a senior policy analyst at the Rand Corp. who follows Iranian affairs, described Mr Rowhani as a de facto hero for reformists who couldn’t support any of the other five candidates on the ballot.

‘It remains to be seen how much room will be given to Rowhani by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard,’ he cautioned.

Iran’s new leader is said to be fluent in English, German, Russian, French and Arabic.

He appears to be proud of his Scottish education, even mentioning it in a campaign video. He studied at the old Glasgow Polytechnic - now Glasgow Caledonian University - in the 1970s under his family name, Hassan Feridon, and returned in the 1990s to get his law doctorate.
