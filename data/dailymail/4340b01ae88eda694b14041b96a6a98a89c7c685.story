Dramatic footage of the moment five chimpanzees broke out of their enclosure and wandered among terrified visitors at a German zoo has emerged.

The primates mingled with 2,500 tourists thronging Experience Zoo in Hanover last week after escaping from their compound using a ladder they had fashioned together out of tree branches.

But while the chimps were content to taste life on the other side of the fence, a five-year-old girl and an an elderly man were hurt in the panic as staff hurriedly evacuated the park.

The moment shocked visitors were confronted by the apes was captured by visitor Kai Hauser, 34, on his mobile phone.

Mr Hauser, who runs and electronic skateboard company, recorded several unexpected interactions between the chimps and startled tourists.

He was walking with his girlfriend and her sister's family towards an area called 'Gorillas Hills' when they heard some strange noises.

Mr Hauser said: 'Suddenly we heard very loud screaming and noises from apes, like "Uh uh, ah ah" through the bushes.

'Nobody saw anything, only the loud screaming from the chimps came through the bushes so it was frightening and everyone on the way stopped walking and was looking around with open mouths.

'Then we heard a women behind the bushes shouting, "Oh no! Stop, come back."

'A few seconds later one chimp came around the corner - he was very relaxed and walked up to a man and gave him a hug.

'The chimp looked like he wanted to kiss him... but then he opened his mouth revealing his big teeth and we feared he could bite his chin off.'

Much to everyone's relief the chimp let go of the man and walked off, Mr Hauser said.

Further footage shows a father holding his daughters' hands as a chimp approaches. There then follows a brief stand-off before the chimp simply walks away.

Mr Hauser said: 'Other chimps made their way to the place I was filming. I can't be sure but I think it was three or four different ones that are seen in the clips I filmed.

'My friend took the children and fled to the souvenir shop where they locked the doors to gave the visitors a safe place to hide.'

In the footage, some people can be heard nervously laughing as the apes walked through the park.

Mr Hauser said: 'It was a mixture between being stunned and scared and excited. Nobody knew if it was dangerous or not so everyone tried to not attract the attention of the chimps.

'The chimps were unpredictable and they showed unmistakably that they were the bosses and this was now their district.'

The final part of the video shows authorities escorting panicked visitors from the park.

'We stayed 15 minutes in the souvenir shop until the keepers guided all visitors out of the zoo,' Mr Hauser said.

'As
we left the zoo you could here the sirens of the police, fire brigade, 
ambulances. Police surrounded the zoo with the advice to shoot the 
chimps if they passed the zoo fences.'

Some 27 police cars raced to the scene
to help steer the animals, which are often aggressive, extremely strong
and capable of killing a human in seconds.

They were joined by zookeepers armed with pepper spray.

A five-year-old girl hurt herself when she fell over at the sight of them but was not seriously injured.

An
elderly man also needed medical attention when he was locked in the 
tropical house in 100 degree heat as the chimps roamed outside.

Four of the five chimps - seven in total live in the enclosure - tasted freedom and decided they didn’t like it much.

They wandered back to the enclosure on their own - but leader of the pack Maxi was enjoying himself on the outside.

'He took himself off to see the head gorilla,' said zoo spokesman Simone Hagenmeyer.

'He was a bit harder to coax back. He’s getting on a bit so we gave him a ladder to climb back into the enclosure.'

An inquiry is now underway to determine what happened.

The zoo could be faced with a huge bill for the fleet of police, ambulances and fire engines that raced to the scene.
