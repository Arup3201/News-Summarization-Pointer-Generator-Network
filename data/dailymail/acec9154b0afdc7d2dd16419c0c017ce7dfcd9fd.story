Trevor Hannington has been jailed for harassing a woman who provided a witness statement against him

A Nazi thug dubbed 'The Fist' has been jailed for posting abusive messages about the woman who 'grassed him up' to police.

Hitler-loving alcoholic Trevor Hannington, 61, from Treherbert, South Wales, was due to face trial for offences under the Terrorism Act when former friend Lindsay Seagrim-Trinder gave a witness statement against him.

However, he pleaded guilty so she was never called to court to testify against him.

To get revenge, Hannington went on to publish her name, address, contact details and photograph online, branding her a 'grass'.

Mrs Seagrim-Trinder and her husband, Alistair, met Hannington on a nostalgia website in 2003 before meeting in person once they discovered they all live in South Wales.

Mrs Seagrim-Trinder did not agree with Hannington's political views or idolisation of Adolf Hitler, but they remained friends on the understanding that views on both subjects would not be discussed.

However, Hannington posted a blog celebrating what would have been Hitler's 120th birthday in 2009 and that is when the friendship broke down.

Later that year, police contacted Mrs Seagrim-Trinder to speak to her about an investigation into terrorist activities involving Hannington.

He and a friend, part of 
far-right extremist group Aryan Strike Force, left comments online 
describing Jews as 'scum' and calling for them to be 'destroyed'.

Hannington was later convicted of 
stirring up racial hatred and distributing terrorist publications at 
Liverpool Crown Court. He was sentenced to two years.

She later felt guilty for helping police and after he was jailed at Belmarsh prison she agreed to house him when he was released.

Prosecutor Rachel Knight said: 'She felt an amount of guilty because she provided a statement and did not want to kick him whilst he was down, so she gave him a second chance.'

But after he was out of jail, he 
posted Mrs Seagrim Trinder's details online leaving her frightened of revenge 
attacks from his fellow fascists.

Hannington, of Treherbert, South 
Wales, admitted harassment. He was jailed for 12 months and given a 12 
month restraining order banning him from contacting Mrs Seagrim-Trinder.

Judge Christopher Llewellyn-Jones QC jailed Hannington said: 'You felt resentful towards her.

'Revenge was a motivating factor in the committal of these offences.'
