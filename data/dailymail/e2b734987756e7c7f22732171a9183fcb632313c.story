On December 6, Francis Coquelin put in a battling performance for Charlton away at Nottingham Forest. His Arsenal career looked to be over.

But in the space of just 43 days the young Frenchman is seemingly irreplaceable in the Gunners midfield after a masterclass in shielding his defence in the 2-0 victory at Manchester City.

Such a display from the whole side has led to questions whether the penny has finally dropped with Arsene Wenger. And after years of trialling several players, he may have found a new midfield general.

At the end of last year Coquelin was on loan at Charlton, with his Arsenal career seemingly over

2008-present: Arsenal (28 apps, 0 goals)

2010–2011: Lorient LOAN (24 apps 1 goal)

2013–2014: Freiburg LOAN (16 apps 0 goals)

2014: Charlton Athletic LOAN (5 apps 0 goals)

Coquelin's commanding influence in midfield in shackling City playmaker David Silva was one Arsenal fans have longed for since the days of Gilberto Silva and Patrick Vieira.

At just 23 years of age, his sense of leadership from the first whistle was evident on Sunday. The fact that Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny were rarely called upon in Manchester was testament to his performance.

Coquelin won 100 per cent of his tackles, 7/8 of his aerial duels, made six interceptions, 11 clearances, and his passion and desire on the pitch went down a storm with the travelling supporters.

While this was just his 13th Premier League start, Coquelin is no stranger to the Arsenal shirt although he has often deputised at full back, something which makes his renaissance all the more surprising. 

The worry with the former Lorient teen was never his ability to tackle or his tenacity, but his passing, positional sense and know-how.

Arsene Wenger watched his Arsenal side beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium

Interceptions: 6

Tackles: 3/3

Aerial duels won: 7/8

Clearances: 11

Passing accuracy: 87 per cent 

However, he was cool in possession (with an 87 per cent passing accuracy), always had an eye on Silva and showed his maturity after Santi Cazorla opened the scoring in the first half.

While his team-mates were celebrating by the corner flag, Coquelin can be seen instructing them to calm down, to keep their focus. It was only at the final whistle that he really started to celebrate, cupping his ear in front of the away fans to ramp up the noise.

'I took him from France at the age of 16,' Wenger said of his compatriot. 'Today he is 23. He has gone through some difficult periods but he's a learner from his experiences. I've always kept faith in him, because I told him three months ago that he needed to play somewhere.

'He accepted to go down to Charlton and had convincing performances. Now he's come back, I've played him and he's done very well.'

Of course, the whole team should take credit for the performance, as should Wenger. 

But have the performances of Coquelin been tactical genius or pure luck? If all men were fit on Sunday he surely wouldn't have started.

Struggling to make an impact on a season-long loan at Freiburg last season, his Arsenal career looked to be over despite failing to move away in the summer.

Another short-term deal followed in the Championship with Charlton, more as a means of getting minutes under his belt than with a view to stepping up again with the first team.

But with Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta struggling with form and fitness in north London, Wenger placed his faith in Coquelin. A battling performance at the City Ground last month turned out to be his last performance for the Addicks, he was booked in the 1-1 draw.

Coquelin impressed in games against Hull and Stoke, but against the champions he stood up to the toughest test.

Thierry Henry had insisted that Arsenal sign Alex Song, but after the game praised Coquelin

His tale is similar to that of Alex Song, another man who impressed at Arsenal after a loan move at The Valley. 

New Sky Sports pundit and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry was one urging Wenger to bring back Song, now at West Ham, but even he couldn't help but be impressed by Coquelin.

'I think that he can do the job. Easily. You just have to be disciplined,' Henry said after the game. 'If you're a centre back and you have that protection, you have an easier game.

'He can do it. It's just up to them to show it every time now.' 

Arteta, Flamini, Song, as well as Denilson and Abou Diaby, have tried and failed to make the 'Claude Makelele' role their own, but none stood up to the champions like the man from Laval.

Transfer targets have fallen by the wayside. It's now Coquelin's position to lose.
