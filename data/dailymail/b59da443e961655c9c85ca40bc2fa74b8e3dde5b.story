Britain is bankrolling EU institutions at a record £20billion a year, undermining David Cameron’s efforts to slash the Brussels budget.

The net contribution of UK taxpayers to the European Union has soared by an inflation-busting 13 per cent in one year.

Latest figures show that the gap between what the UK handed Brussels and what it got back has now reached £12.2billion in 2012, up from £10.8billion in 2011.

Efforts undermined: Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured in Brussels in May) has insisted that Britain will be £600million better off this year, having argued for a cut in EU spending at a summit in February

Britain received only £7.78billion from Brussels – the lowest return in a decade thanks to the eurozone crisis, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Since the economic downturn began, the UK’s contribution to the EU has doubled.

And the figures do not include an extra £1.4billion which the Government was forced to hand over to the European Investment Bank in March.

The Prime Minister has insisted that Britain will be £600million better off this year, having argued for a cut in EU spending at a summit in February.

However, the Treasury’s bill alone for EU membership has more than trebled in the last decade, increasing from £2.9million to £9.5billion in 2012.

James Harvard, of campaign group Get Britain Out, said: ‘We’re often told that one of the benefits of EU membership is the grants and payments that it makes to Britain.

‘But these figures expose the truth: For every pound we receive from Brussels, we’ve first had to give them more than two.

'Cut our losses': Godfrey Bloom, a UKIP MEP, said the figures showed the EU was bad value for Britain 'as we close our A&Es, cut defence, cut police and raise tax'

‘When public services are being cut to save money at home, it’s frankly offensive that the EU pocketed an additional £1.4billion last year. It’s 1.4billion further reasons for us to leave.’

Godfrey Bloom, a UKIP MEP, said the figures showed the EU was bad value for Britain ‘as we close our A&Es, cut defence, cut police and raise tax’.

He said: ‘No matter how hard the Government try to spin it we are paying more for the EU and getting less. It is time to cut our losses and leave as soon as possible.’

Tory MP Mark Reckless said: ‘I was accused of scaremongering when I said our EU budget contribution was set to hit £20billion but now it has gone over that.

‘If we left the EU and it were mad enough not to agree a free trade area, the £20billion plus saved could pay the cost of any tariffs three times over.’

Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan added: ‘Last year, the Government made austerity savings of around £8.6billion. These are, in effect, all wiped out and more by the net contribution to Brussels.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘As the Prime
 Minister told Parliament in his European Council statement last 
February, the last government gave away almost half of our rebate.

Troubled: The IMF revealed that an extra £8.8billion would be needed in 2014 and 2015 to bail out Greece. The black hole will open up from summer next year, when Greece's current financing arrangement runs out

'This has had a long-term and continuing effect on the UK’s net contributions. Almost whatever budget deal was done in February, our net contributions were always likely to go up.

‘As a result of the deal that was done, though, they will be going up by less.’

In a separate blow for the eurozone, the IMF yesterday revealed that an extra £8.8billion would be needed in 2014 and 2015 to bail out Greece.

The black hole will open up from summer next year, when Greece’s current financing arrangement runs out.

And a powerful Lords committee will today warn ministers that the eurozone is vulnerable to fresh crises.

The EU sub-committee on economic and financial affairs has written to Greg Clark, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, expressing concern that European leaders were continuing to ‘muddle through’ the economic difficulties.

It urged ministers to explain how the UK could continue to work within the evolving EU while remaining outside the single currency.
