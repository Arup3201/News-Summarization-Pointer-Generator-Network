This is the dramatic moment a dummy is 'annihilated' by a fierce explosion caused by a deadly Onion Bomb firework.

In the video clip, posted by firefighters to warn of the dangers of fireworks, the mannequin's torso is seen flying backwards into the air, closely followed by a detached arm.

The footage has been released in the run-up to Bonfire Night, after a young boy was seriously injured while holding one of the professional-standard pyrotechnics.

Deadly: This is the dramatic moment a dummy is annihilated by a deadly Onion Bomb. The footage has been released by firefighters to warn of the dangers of fireworks in the run up to Bonfire Night

The 10-year-old was left with serious burns and facial injuries, losing his hair, eyebrows and eyelashes in the explosion in Salford, Greater Manchester last year.

Keen for the tragedy not to be repeated, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service hope that the video, posted on YouTube, will highlight the dangers of playing with fireworks as part of the brigade's annual Treacle campaign.

Assistant County Fire Officer and 
Director of Prevention, Peter O'Reilly said: 'As Bonfire Night 
approaches we want everyone to enjoy it safely, so this video serves as a
reminder to children and parents what can happen if you don't take 
firework safety seriously.

'Last
year everyone remembers the shocking image of a 10-year-old boy in 
hospital with serious injuries, he had been holding an illegal onion 
bomb when it exploded in his face.

'This year, we hope this video, which reveals the horrors of firework injuries, will make people think twice.'

Onion bombs, which are used in professional displays and are not available for sale to the general public.

The video was posted by firefighters to highlight the dangers of playing with fireworks

There is an initial blast of fire as the Onion Bomb detonates in the mannequin's hand

The dummy's hand is visibily damaged as the body is enveloped in a cloud of thick smoke

After the initial explosion there is a second blast, where the dummy is thrown backwards

The clip has been viewed more than 4,000 times and was posted along with a message from Manchester Fire which read: 'The dangers of onion bombs 
are brutally demonstrated in this dramatic video.

'Our model is 
annihilated by the explosion, it's hand blown clean off and torso sent 
spiraling into the air'

When one internet user commented that he was 'going to make one of these', the brigade replied: 'We hope you are joking, but pleaseï»¿ film yourself making one if you do. Will be useful for the coroner.'

It is now legal to sell fireworks with the correct licence or 
registration until November 10, and GMFRS fire protection officers will
be visiting premises storing them to check people are complying with 
regulations.

Assistant Chief
Constable Garry Shewan of Greater Manchester Police said: "Halloween 
and Bonfire Night are nearly upon us - occasions where traditionally 
whole families get together to enjoy the fun and festivities.

The dummy has been torn in two as it flies through the air

Little is left of the mannequin after the deadly blast, which firefighters hope will stop people from playing with fireworks

'I would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone of the need to behave responsibly and respect others at this time of year, and to understand the consequences of irresponsible behaviour on themselves and others.

'If behaviour gets out of hand and causes distress to anyone then we will take firm action, and I would urge people to report any antisocial behaviour to police.'

The shocking photograph of the injured 10-year-old lying in his hospital bed, his burned face covered with a protective mask, was released by his mother last year.

Shocking: The unnamed 10-year-old from Salford suffered serious facial injuries after playing with an industrial firework

Danger: An Onion Bomb similar to the one which blew up in the young boy's face while he was playing with it

The unnamed boy and his 11-year-old friend, Dale Stephenson, suffered serious burns after playing with an industrial firework in the street and his mother was desperate to ensure that other children did not suffer similar consequences and hopes
that releasing the photo will make people think twice about playing 
with fireworks.

Dale's mother Vicky Stephenson said: 'Dale was outside a shop doing penny for a guy with his mates when I went to the shops. Next thing I knew he was ringing me screaming saying a firework exploded and he'd burnt his face.

'He was hysterical with the pain and they put him on morphine when we got to the hospital. He's lost his hair, eyebrows and eyelashes and got burns on his hands, his skin is peeling off.

'Fireworks should be banned. They need to stop coming into the country because they are just so dangerous.'
