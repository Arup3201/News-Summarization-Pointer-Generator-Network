As if plans to send a TARDIS into space weren’t enough, now Dr Who fans want to name an entire planet in honour of the show.

Fans of the programme, known as ‘Whovians’, have set up a petition to name a recently discovered gas giant ‘Gallifrey’ after the home of the Time Lords.

In the past 24 hours, the petition has had 50,000 signatures with a current total of over 80,000.

The planet, whose original name is HD 
106906 b, was discovered by the University of Arizona earlier this year 
and has been baffling scientists ever since.

Astronomers recently said that the distant planet is so strange, that according to current planet formation theories, it shouldn’t even exist.

The planet is 11 times Jupiter’s mass and orbits its star at an incredible 650 times the average Earth-sun distance.

It has a temperature of 2,700 Fahrenheit (about 1,500 °C) making it much cooler than its host star. It emits most of its energy as infrared rather than visible light.

Earth, by comparison, formed 4.5 billion years ago and is about 350 times older.

HD 106906 b  is 11 times Jupiter’s mass and orbits its star at an incredible 650 times the average Earth-Sun distance.

At only 13 million years old, this young planet still glows from the residual heat of its formation.

In Dr Who, the planet Gallifrey is 
located in a binary star system within the constellation of Kasterborous
 some 250 million light years away from Earth.

The petition, which was started by Australian fan Sam Menhennet, calls for the International Astronomical Union to rename the planet in honour of Doctor Who's 50th Birthday.

‘Doctor Who is legendary, award winning, record breaking, and global, and this planet deserves something special and supernatural as its name,’ he said.

‘How better to honour its existence than by dubbing it the home planet of our beloved time travelling alien, ‘The Doctor’?’

The petition can be signed at Change.org.
