Equalities minister Jo Swinson said women should not feel pressurised by their bosses to freeze their eggs

Women should not feel pressurised into delaying having children by their bosses, equalities minister Jo Swinson warned today after it emerged firms were offering to pay to freeze employees eggs.

Facebook and Apple are offering the extraordinary perk to female staff to encourage them to focus on their careers before having children later in life.

But Miss Swinson said women needed to have 'genuine choices' about when to start a family and employers must not try to dictate their personal decisions.

Preserving eggs has been described as a key to 'levelling the playing field' in the male-dominated tech industry.

Reports from the United States suggest Facebook is paying female employees up to $20,000 dollars (£12,500) to cover the costs of freezing and storing their eggs, and Apple will start a similar scheme in January.

The controversial debate reached the House of Commons today, when Labour backbencher

Geraint Davies accused the firms of institutional sexism and 'intimidating women'.

He claimed the firms were essentially telling female staff: 'If you want to get to board level, you should have frozen your eggs.'

He added: 'Isn't this the worst case of institutional sexism intimidating women into not having babies at a time of their own choice, and will you unequivocally condemn them?'

Miss Swinson, a mother-of-one who took maternity leave from her ministerial job this year, replied: 'Well, it's up to individual companies on what policies they want to offer and whether indeed employees think that's any kind of incentive or otherwise.

'I think what is important is making sure there are genuine choices that women can make and that therefore women in the workplace do not feel under any kind of pressure to delay starting a family if that is in fact what they want to do at a particular point in their career.

'And the Government's changes to make much more modern the procedures around maternity leave and shared parental leave are absolutely essentially to making sure women and men can make the choices that work for them around parenting.'

Bank: The eggs will be put in deep freeze so women can continue their careers, the technology giants said

The fact that two of Silicon Valley's biggest companies are introducing the initiative is no coincidence. 

Tech giants are fighting for talented staff in what has become known as the 'perk arms race'.

Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, in particular, is known for her pro-women stance.

The social media firm gives new parents £3,000 in so-called 'baby cash' to spend however they like. Both firms also offer generous wellness-orientated benefits to staff.

Critics say the move is simply a ploy to persuade women to stay with the company.

An Apple source indicated the company had no plans to extend the policy to the firm's UK workforce.

An Apple spokesman in the US said: 'We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families.'
