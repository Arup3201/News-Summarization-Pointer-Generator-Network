Olympic rower James Cracknell, TV historian Dan Snow and presenter Jeremy Paxman are among the celebrities being tipped to replace Sir Malcolm Rifkind as a Tory MP.

The veteran politician, who has held the seat since 2005, announced yesterday that he was stepping down as MP for Kensington after becoming mired in the latest cash for access scandal.

The announcement has triggered a race to see who will replace the Tory grandee in what is traditionally been one of the safest Conservative seats in the country, just months before the election.

Former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, who last year denied he was in the running as Tory candidate for London Mayor, is also rumoured to be on the list of those who could stand for the safe Conservative seat

Now a string of well-known faces are rumoured to be poised for stepping into the Tory  seat, including footballer Frank Lampard, cricketer Andrew Strauss and Sol Campbell.

According to Ladbrokes, the favourite to replace Sir Malcolm is Greg Smith, a Tory councillor who sits on Hammersmith and Fulham council.

But he is closely followed by double Gold medallist James Cracknell, who is odds-on 8/1 for taking over the seat. 

Following reports that he was popular because he had 'no skeletons' in his cupboard, his TV presenter wife Beverley Turner tweeted: 'No skeletons. A LOT of trainers.' 

Mr Cracknell recently turned to politics, but failed to clinch the Bexhill and Battle seat in East Sussex and the Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat, where Boris Johnson was selected.

Andrew Strauss, the England cricketer, is 10/1 favourite to take over from Sir Malcolm 

In May, the father-of-three also stood in the European Parliament elections, but narrowly missed a seat.  

Last year, Paxman was rumoured to be sounded out by Conservative party as its candidate for the Mayor of London.

But he quashed the rumours by saying he would not take the job for 'all the eclairs in Paris'.

Last night, a local source said Mr Paxman was a real contender, telling The Daily Telegraph: 'He would have to give up his job for Channel Four in the election but he lives in the borough.'  

But, according to The Sun, the favourite is Dan Snow, who Number 10 apparently contacted within hours of Sir Malcolm's resignation.

The historian, a great-great-grandson of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, last year led a campaign against Scottish Independence, by gathering the names of 200 celebrities who were against the move.

He last night tweeted it was a 'safe' and 'glamorous' seat.

Local members have reportedly been told by Conservative Central Office that they will be three candidates to choose from and that it is likely to be well-known Tory figure.

But Kirstie Allsopp ruled herself out of the running because she does not have a degree.

The veteran politician announced yesterday that he is quitting as an MP after being caught in a scandal over alleged cash for access, alongside former foreign secretary Jack Straw

The former Foreign Secretary (pictured) told undercover reporters that he had a usual fee of between £5,000 to £8,000 for a half-day's work for representing private companies

Last night she tweeted: 'My borough needs serious minds for serious times, not pretty faces looking for a career change.' She also shared her support for Sir Malcolm.

The former foreign secretary stepped down yesterday, saying it was 'the right and proper' thing to do, but denying any wrongdoing. 

It emerged this weekend that he had been filmed by undercover reporters after bragging that he could see any foreign ambassador in London and has 'useful access' to every British ambassador in the world.

Despite being in charge of the Intelligence and Security Committee, he also boasted about having lots of free time to read and go walking.  

Mr Snow was reportedly contacted by Number 10, hours after Sir Malcolm's resignation. He yesterday tweeted about the seat, calling it 'safe' and 'glamorous'

Ladbrokes published its most recent odds on who is tipped to replace Sir Malcolm for the May election 

Labour MP Jack Straw, also a former foreign secretary, was also caught up in the scandal and suspended from the party.

Announcing he was standing down as chairman and would not fight the general election in May, Sir Malcolm said: 'I don't think I did anything wrong. I may have made errors of judgment, but that's a different matter.'

In a statement announcing his decision to quit the Commons, he added: 'I had intended to seek one further term as MP for Kensington, before retiring from the House of Commons. 

Meanwhile, Kirsty Allsopp was forced to deny rumours she would be standing for the Conservative seat

She tweeted her support for Sir Malcolm before saying she could not stand for it because she does not have a degree

'I have concluded that to end the uncertainty it would be preferable, instead, to step down at the end of this Parliament.

'This is entirely my personal decision. I have had no such requests from my constituency association but I believe that it is the right and proper action to take.'

Senior Tories were said to be furious at the impact on the party's image just weeks before the election.
