The mother of a toddler with cerebral palsy was forced to sit on the floor of a bus as she held on to her brain-damaged son when elderly passengers refused to give up their seats in the disabled area.

Alisha Frost, 24, was left in tears as she held on to her two-year-old son Jack's pushchair on the Stagecoach bus X4 service from Cardiff to Merthyr.

She claims that when she boarded the bus, the pull-down disabled seats were all taken by passengers in their 60s and 70s.

But she said when she asked the driver if he could ask them to move so she could park her son's pushchair, he refused.

Then when she approached the passengers herself, they too refused to help her, she claims.

Miss Frost said she had been on the bus home to Pontypridd, after a rare shopping trip with her son who has brain damage and cerebral palsy.

She said: 'They told me they didn't have to move for me and told me to just fold the buggy up and sit my son on my knee.

Ms Frost said her son, who has brain damage and cerebral palsy, cannot come out of his chair on journeys as he needs the support his chair provides

'I explained that I couldn't do this as my son is disabled and he needs the correct support or he flings himself forwards.'

Jack cannot sit on his mother's lap as he needs the support of harnesses in his buggy.

She said the driver eventually intervened, but she was still forced to sit on the floor and hold on to her son's pushchair tightly as she did not have enough room to put the brake on.

She said she left the bus in tears after no one helped her.

She said: 'I'm furious about the whole situation and have been so upset since - it's just wrong that we were treated in this way.'

A spokesman for Stagecoach in South Wales said they were investigating the incident.

'All of our drivers receive formal customer care training, so it is extremely disappointing to be told of this lady's and her child's experience, which falls far below the standard that we expect and regularly achieve from the vast majority of drivers employed by us.'
