Dale Jennings bagged a brace as ruthless Barnsley showed no mercy against non-League Chester to book their place in the third round of the FA Cup.

Barnsley’s players were woeful in the first match at Oakwell but a rollicking from Tykes boss Danny Wilson did the trick as they swept their Conference opponents aside to set up a home tie against Middlesbrough.

The visitors edged ahead when Peter Ramage’s shot was blocked by Matty Brown and the ball fell kindly to Kane Hemmings who emphatically dispatched it high into the net from near the penalty spot. Chester were fortunate to only be a goal down at half-time with goalkeeper Jon Worsnop forced to make saves to deny Jennings and Conor Hourihane.

Barnsley took the sting out of the contest just after the hour when Hemmings slid in Jennings and the winger curled a low shot into the corner. The same player rounded off the scoring in the 88th minute with the pick of the goals, jinking his way into the box with a mazy dribble before planting a shot pass Worsnop.

Matt Done scored a hat-trick as Rochdale comfortably saw off Conference side Aldershot with a thumping 4-1 victory to book a third-round tie at home to Nottingham Forest.

The League One side, who beat Colchester by the same scoreline on Saturday, took charge of this second-round replay when Done struck in the 31st mnute. Aldershot’s Dan Fitchett equalised in the second half but Rochdale made sure when Peter Vicenti made it 2-1 before Done struck twice in the last 10 minutes.

Tranmere finally had something to celebrate as a goal from Max Power booked them a third-round tie at home to Swansea with a 2-1 victory at home to Oxford.

Struggling at the bottom of League Two for much of the season, Tranmere fell behind in the 29th minute when Alfie Potter headed in from Danny Hylton’s cross. But they fought back to equalise with a Kayode Odejayi shot seven minutes later. Then, with 15 minutes left, Power popped up to score from a difficult angle to win it for the home side.

League Two side Cambridge and Luton will meet in the third round after both won 1-0 last night.

Luton beat Bury at home thanks to a second-half strike from Luke Rooney while Cambridge won at Mansfield after Sully Kaikai scored with a right-foot shot in the 10th minute.
