When a Virginia teenager asked his mom to stop the car so he could get out in the cold and help an elderly man shovel snow, he was just doing it out of the kindness of his heart.

But when his mom posted a picture of the selfless good deed on Facebook, Tommy Adams' good deed won praise across the US. 

The 18-year-old, who spends snow days clearing snow and ice from neighborhood driveways and sidewalks in rural Nottoway County, took pity on Clarence Coleman, aged 76.

Tommy Adams did not think twice about asking his mum Teresa to stop the car so he could get out and help Clarence Coleman, pictured in the background with his walker, clear a mountain of snow from his driveway. This picture went viral when Ms Adams posted it on Facebook

Mr Coleman praised his young helper, saying 'the good lord could bless' the kindhearted high school senior 

The old man had a walker with him as he strugged to clear a mountain of snow from his driveway when Tommy and his mum Teresa drove past on their way home from the DMV.

'Tommy said "Mamma stop the car,''' Teresa Adams recalled. 

'I got scared and asked "what's wrong?''

'He said, "there's an older man with a walker shoveling snow — I'll help him out,"' she added.

Tommy approached the man and asked him for the snow shovel.

'He looked surprised,' Teresa said. 'I was so proud, I started to cry.' 

Teresa snapped a photo of her son's good deed, which was later shared on the WTVR CBS 6 News Facebook page.

'He was relieved; he looked tired,' Tommy said. 

'I told him to get back into his car because it was cold. Other people who saw him in the snow should have had the decency to stop.'

His mum Teresa Adams said 'I was so proud, I started to cry', at her son's selfless good deed 

Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe was one of many to praise Tommy Adams' actions on social media

Tommy said it appeared a plow had driven by and built up the snow on the man's driveway along Old Nottoway Road. 

He said the snow was deep and it took him more than 15 minutes to clear the driveway for the man.

'He said "God bless you, the world needs more people like you"', Tommy recalled.

Tommy said he did not catch the man's name at the time, but he was glad he was there to help.

'I try to do good for the elderly because one day I may need help too,' Tommy said.

Mr Coleman praised his young helper, saying of Tommy and his mum: 'They are good people. 

'The good lord can bless them and they will have good luck as long as they live.' 

People took to Twitter to praise the teenager for his good deed. 

One said: 'Kudos to this teen. Goodness and decency has no color or age limit.'

Another added: 'We always hear about the bad, but not enough about the good. WTG Tommy Adams!'

And Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe posted: 'Proud of Virginia residents like Tommy Adams of Nottoway County - exemplifying what it means to be a Virginian'.
