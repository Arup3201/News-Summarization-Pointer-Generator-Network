Tragedy: Alistair Mathie, 67, was hit by the blades after jumping out to allow a student to fly solo

A flying instructor may have been dazzled by the sun before he stumbled into a whirling propeller and was killed, an inquest heard.

Former RAF pilot Alistair Mathie, 67, was hit by the rotating blades after jumping out of a plane at Tibenham airfield near Diss, Norfolk, to allow a student to fly solo during a lesson.

He died instantly from massive head injuries, the inquest in Norwich heard.

His widow Dorothy said he had decades of flying experience and she did not believe he had mistakenly stepped into the propeller of the Piper Cub J3C-65 light aircraft.

Mrs Mathie, who lived with her husband in Burgate, Suffolk, said in a statement: 'The sun was very bright and low that day, and it would have been full in his face.

'The most likely explanation, I believe, is that he was dazzled and disorientated by the sun. He stumbled on the wheel and stepped into the propeller while trying to get his balance.'

An Air Accidents Investigation Branch report published last October, after the accident on January 28, suggested that Mr Mathie might not have heard the propeller because he was wearing headphones.

It also suggested he might not have seen the propeller, even though the tips of the blades were different colours.

Finally, it said that the wind produced by the working engine when the aircraft was stationary was not particularly strong and he might not have felt it.

The report stated the accident illustrated the importance of pilots following a path along the edge of the wing when approaching or leaving an aircraft to ensure safe clearance.

Robert Weller, Mr Mathie’s student on the day of the tragedy, described him as one of the most experienced pilots he knew.

He said he saw Mr Mathie, a Light Aircraft Association coach, climb out of the aircraft at and they then had a brief conversation.

He added: 'He turned towards the front of the aircraft. The next thing I knew the engine had stopped. I really had no idea what had happened.'

Another pilot, Michael Nice, said he was about 100 yards away from the scene.

He said: 'The aeroplane was stationary. I noticed the door/window open and Al getting out. I waited to watch Rob Weller’s first circuit.

'When Al got out of the aircraft he turned and walked away. He walked towards the front of the aircraft and he made contact with the propeller.'

AAIB investigator Nicholas Dann told the inquest that it was impossible to confirm the exact cause of the accident.

He said there was some debate about whether the engine of a stationary aircraft should be turned off or left on for safety reasons if it was about to fly again.

If it was turned off, it would have to be restarted by hand which carried some risk as it would then entail someone having to hand-start the propeller to start it up again.

He said of 15 previous air accidents involving propellers, ten had been caused by them being hand-started, and five by the engine being left on.

A post-mortem examination found that the cause of death was severe head injuries as a result of being hit by an aeroplane propeller.

Norfolk Coroner William Armstrong recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Mr Mathie had a total of 14,709 hours' flying experience. He flew Jaguar fighter jets during a 30-year career with the RAF and later became a civilian pilot for Thomas Cook before retiring.

Speaking at the time of his death, Peter Gill, secretary of the International Auster Club, said Mr Mathie was ‘the best of the best’ in the flying world.

Mr Gill, 67, said: 'I cannot believe what has happened. I am gutted. Al was a highly skilled pilot. If you were going to fly with somebody he was the man you would choose.

'He was very well respected all over the world - I have received tributes from Brazil, South America, Australia and New Zealand from people who knew Al.

'l taught his wife Dot to fly. They keep their own Auster plane on their farm - it was Al’s pride and joy.'
