Swansea have announced that Gambian forward Mo Barrow has signed a four-year contract at the Barclays Premier League club.

Barrow, 22, joined the Swans on a short-term deal last summer from Swedish side Ostersunds FK.

He featured as a substitute when Swansea beat Arsenal in November, while further appearances followed against Manchester City and Crystal Palace.

Barrow, whose new deal ties him to Swansea until 2018, scored his first goal for the club in last Saturday's 6-2 FA Cup third-round win at Tranmere.

He enjoyed a number of impressive performances for Swansea's Under 21 side before being elevated to senior duties by manager Garry Monk.

'It's great to sign the new contract. It was an easy decision,' Barrow told Swansea's official website.

'I came here until January initially, but now I can settle for the next four years.

'It's been amazing to play for the first team since joining in the summer.

'I have tried to work as hard as possible in training and when I've been given my chance, but I know I must keep working for further opportunities.'
