Under-fire MP Nadine Dorries has defended her controversial decision to go on  I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here - claiming she will donate her MPs' salary during her time on the show to charity.

Mrs Dorries did not mention what she intends to do with her fee from ITV's reality show.

She is receiving a reported £40,000 fee for taking part - nearly eight times the maximum amount of money she will donate.

With an MPs' salary of £65,738 per year, if she lasts the full three weeks on the show, she will donate a mere £3,738.57 to charity.

Nadine Dorries looks worn out after her first appearance on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here yesterday - coinciding with the publication of her column revealed she will donate her MPs' salary for the time she is on the show to charity

But Mrs Dorries has accounted for four weeks leave from her constituency - which would increase her donation to £5,056.76.

She made the extraordinary comments before her laptop was taken away at 
the start of filming for the show and imposed an embargo for it to 
appear in her Conservativehome website column after the show went live.

The news comes after her Mid-Bedfordshire constituents were furious at the prospect of her abandoning her post for up to four weeks on full pay.

The
MP has drawn widespread criticism for swapping her parliamentary duties
for the Australian reality TV jungle, and has been suspended by her 
party while she is away.

Despite the furore, Mrs Dorries seems to believe appearing on the show will only enhance her career as a politician.

She says in her blog that being on the show is a 'publicity gift' 
and a way of communicating with 16 million people. She says she 'seized' upon the opportunity, and 'who wouldn't?'

She
justified her decision, 
arguing that 'more people watch the X- Factor final than voted in the 
general election', so the realm of reality TV is 'where politicians need
to be too'.

Mrs Dorries said that while she may have 
to eat a kangaroo's testicle she may also have the chance to talk about 
abortion time limits, or to 'big up Boris'.

In her column she would donate her MP's salary during her time 
on the programme to children's charities in her constituency.

Prime
Minister David Cameron has backed the decision by Chief Whip Sir George
Young to suspend her and said Mrs Dorries had not informed him she was 
taking part in the ITV show.

But
Mrs Dorries insisted in her column - which she submitted a week ago and 
was published yesterday - that she had told the Whips Office she would 
be away for up to a month.

She wrote: 'Do people understand why I am in a jungle, eating only three handfuls of rice a day with a few beans thrown in?

'I
think many may have guessed that I am a bit of an anti-politics 
politician... I believe that we politicians need to spend less time 
talking to each other and more time talking to people.'

She
continued: 'An audience of 16 million people for the first and last 
show and 12 million per show is a very large audience. In the world of 
messaging, it's huge. It would have been mad to have refused... The 
majority of people don't look to Westminster and they don't buy 
newspapers, as the distribution figures show us.

Nadine Dorries says she 'seized' upon the opportunity to take part on the show. Here she talks politics with Hugo Taylor

'They
do however surf the net, watch popular TV and engage with reality 
shows. If that is where sixteen million people are, it's where 
politicians need to be too.'

She
added: 'MPs are not popular and so I don't expect to be in the jungle 
for very long but I hope I can do something to make some people think 
again. That some of us politicians come from very normal backgrounds and
went into politics for reasons of deep belief and principle.'

And
in a typically acerbic parting shot she said: 'Whilst the half term 
recess is under way, I will be working with rats and snakes in a jungle.
It's not really very different from Westminster after all.'

The politician was accused of snubbing a Remembrance Sunday service yesterday in her constituency by taking part in the show.

The
British Legion in her constituency told ITV it received a letter from 
the MP in the Autumn, saying she would be 'out of the country' and could
not attend.
