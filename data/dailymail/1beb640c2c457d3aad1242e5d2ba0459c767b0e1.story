The CEO of memory chip maker Micron died yesterday morning in a tragic accident when the small experimental fixed-wing plane he was piloting crashed at an airport.

A recording of a conversation Steve Appleton had with air traffic controllers just moments before his death shows his panic as he desperately radioed: 'I'd like to turn back in and, uh, land... coming back in'.

Mr Appleton, 51, a professional stunt plane pilot and former motocross racer, was the only person in the plane when it crashed at the Boise airport in Idaho. Trading in Micron stocks has been halted.

Authorities received reports of a small aircraft that was on fire before it landed on Friday morning.

Tragedy: Steve Appleton, 51, died on Friday morning when a small, experimental fixed-wing plane he was piloting crashed at the Boise airport in Idaho

Dead: It's not the first time Mr Appleton has been in a small plane crash, and questions have been raised in the past about whether the head of a large corporation should be engaging in such a dangerous hobby

‘Steve's passion and energy left an 
indelible mark on Micron, the Idaho community and the technology 
industry at large,’ Micron's board of directors said in a statement.

His amateur-built plane was a 
single-engine Lancair. Aircraft of this type have recently caught the 
attention of national aircraft safety authorities, who are in the 
midst of a study of their safety.

The recording of his last moments, published by ABC News, suggests that air traffic controllers kept calm during the emergency, although a voice in the background sounds like it is saying 'Oh my God, oh my God.'

It's not the first time Mr Appleton 
has been in a small plane crash, and questions have been raised in the 
past about whether the head of a large corporation should be engaging in
that hobby.

He sustained a punctured lung, head 
injuries, ruptured disk and broken bones after his stunt plane crashed 
in the desert near Boise in 2004. He didn’t immediately reveal the 
severity of his injuries.

Micron Technology is one of the 
world's leading providers of advanced semiconductor solutions and it 
manufactures and markets a full range of DRAM, NAND and NOR flash 
memory.

Mr Appleton, a California native and Boise State University graduate, started on the 
factory floor of Micron in 1983 and worked his way up. In 1991, he was made president and chief operating officer.

In 1994, he was appointed to the 
position of chairman, chief executive officer and president.  He assumed
his current position in 2007. Boise-based Micron is one of Idaho's 
largest employers.

In 2011 he received the prestigious Robert Noyce award from the 
Semiconductor Industry Association, named after Intel co-founder Robert 
Noyce, which goes to people who have made major contributions to the 
chip industry.

The Lancair is built from kits, and 
others like it have design characteristics that allow the planes to fly 
much faster than most small planes.

Last year, the National Transportation
Safety Board investigated 222 experimental and amateur-built plane 
accidents in which 67 people were killed.

More than half the accidents involved 
planes that were bought used rather than having been built by the 
current owner. An NTSB study is scheduled to be finished in spring ahead
of a public hearing.

In 2010, the Federal Aviation 
Administration issued a safety advisory to pilots because the planes are
prone to stalling out during slow-speed operations close to the ground.

An FAA analysis found that the planes 
have experienced fatal accident rates substantially higher than other 
small, personal use planes, including other types of planes made from 
kits.

'Steve Appleton was a dynamic leader who skillfully guided Micron through both prosperous and difficult times. He was a philanthropist and a great friend to Boise'

Dave Bieter, Boise Mayor

Micron shares were up 23 cents at 
$7.95 on Friday before trading was halted in the early afternoon for the
announcement. The firm’s shares have traded between $3.97 and $11.95 
over the past year.

'Steve was a high-energy, never-give-up type of inspirational leader of the company,' said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy. The entire industry will miss Steve's energy.'
