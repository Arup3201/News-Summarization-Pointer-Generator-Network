A grieving widow harassed a hospital chief executive for six months because she blamed her for her husband suffering a fatal heart attack in the facilities.

Obsessed Margaret Harvey, 73, blamed Julia Bridgewater for causing the death of her husband Graham in 2004 despite the fact that it happened two years before she got the job.

Harvey would plague Mrs Bridgewater with late night phone calls, turn up outside her home and even hired a private detective in her bid to track down her Bridgewater’s whereabouts.

Harvey said after the hearing at North Staffordshire Magistrates Court that she did not regret her actions and refused to apologise.

She said: ‘Mrs Bridgewater doesn’t answer my questions. I didn’t feel like I had any other options than to hire a detective.’

Lisa Newman, prosecuting told the court how Mrs Harvey had continued to pester Mrs Bridgewater even after a court letter was sent to her asking her to stop.

She called another three times, eventually forcing Mrs Bridgewater to press a recently installed panic alarm.

Mrs Harvey later said in an interview that she consciously rang at night as she knew it would have ‘maximum effect’.

Even though Mrs Bridgewater joined the hospital’s management team as 
late as 2006, Mrs Harvey, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, 
hired a private detective to track down the home address the University 
Hospital of North Staffordshire chief executive.

Mrs Bridgewater told police she felt ‘harassed, stressed and completely and utterly upset’ and was constantly frightened in case Harvey was outside.

When Harvey was interviewed she branded Mrs Bridgewater ‘corrupt’ and told police she was convinced Mrs Bridgewater was to blame for Graham’s death.

Harvey pleaded guilty to harassment at North Staffordshire Magistrates Court on Friday.

The court heard Harvey pestered Mrs Bridgewater between November 26, 2011 and June 6 this year.

Lisa Newman, prosecuting, told the court a letter was sent to Harvey asking her not to contact Mrs Bridgewater at her home.

Lisa Newman said: ‘Harvey told the police about the death of her husband and said she felt the only person who could answer questions, despite the inquiries being held, was Mrs Bridgewater.

‘She admitted contacting her on numerous occasions.’

Harvey’s complaint against the hospital dates back to 2004 when her husband Graham died from a heart attack.

Shaun Kellett, defending, said Harvey could not accept the hospital was not to blame for her husband’s death.

He said: ‘She alleges that the hospital was negligent and she has pursued the matter for eight years.

‘She is seeking some answers and obviously can’t accept the answer she has been given.’

Harvey was released on bail and was ordered to return to court next month for sentencing.

After the hearing, Harvey vowed to continue to pursue the hospital for answers.

She said: ‘I don’t regret what I did. I believe if my husband had been given proper treatment he would have had another 10 years of life or more.

‘It’s unbelievable what they have put me through.

‘ I’ve had a heart attack, I’ve been put in handcuffs and been in prison at 3am.

‘I want answers about why he wasn’t treated earlier. I want the hospital to admit the care was not good enough and I want the people responsible held to account.

‘I’m not interested in money, I want justice for Graham.

‘I have been fighting for eight years now.

A University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust spokesman said: ‘This matter is currently being dealt with by the police and the Trust cannot comment further.’
