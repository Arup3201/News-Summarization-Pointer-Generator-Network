Not even Mike Brown could find a way through, nor could Marland Yarde or Danny Care. Harlequins simply could not unlock the door. It was a ruthless lock-out – another triumph for the Wolf-pack.

Saracens’ fabled defence left their London rivals without a point in front of their own supporters at The Twickenham Stoop last Friday night, while accumulating 39 of their own in a stunning Aviva Premiership mis-match. It was the latest herculean feat founded on Paul Gustard’s succinct instructions to the players, as they prepare to go into ‘monster’ mode.

‘”Go get ‘em”; that’s the message,’ he said. ‘”Go get ‘em; be aggressive”. People are confrontational in attack, so to counter that we have to be confrontational in defence. Rugby is a physical game of chess – you are fighting for space and territory. The task for a defence is to take space away from an attack, put them under pressure then hopefully you get turn-overs.

‘The whole principle is, “Go get ‘em, we want the ball back”. In defence, the system requires clarity of thought because you need to make good decisions. But when the collision happens, you have to release the monster; you have to get angry and be physical to knock that person back.’

Saracens are a team who can win big games even when they have very little possession, such is their ability to soak up long spells of pressure. It was evident against Quins and notably last season in their Heineken Cup quarter-final victory over Ulster in Belfast. Their defence is founded on aggressive intent – on a collective mind-set and work-rate – but Gustard has elevated the whole concept by giving it an identity of its own.

‘The idea of the “Wolf-pack” just came out in a team meeting one day, in quite an organic way,’ he said. ‘We were talking about wanting to go out and hunt them, go out and get them, hunt them like a pack, and it just came into my head, “hunt them like a pack of wolves”.

‘I quite liked it and spoke with the boys about wolf howling – it was quite a vibrant meeting, as you can imagine! We decided to roll with it and I had some T-shirts knocked up. In the first year they said “raised by wolves”, next year we were “born to be wild” and next year it was “hungry like the wolf”. It has continued and it is an easy thing for the boys to talk about.’

Innovation is something Saracens pride themselves on and it extends to coaching methods as well as a broader club out-look. Last year, Gustard brought a pair of wolves into training, which caught the players off-guard and certainly grabbed their attention. There may be similar stunts in the offing as he said: ‘We haven’t had any animals in for a while but we’ll try to amend that maybe! We were talking about a few ideas the other day. It’s never dull here; it’s never dull at all.’

While the pack mentality relies on a unified will to chase, tackle, pressurise and hold the line, there are those at the heart of it who make it all tick as defensive leaders. Gustard pinpoints three key men; Jacques Burger and Will Fraser – the two abrasive openside flankers – and Brad Barritt.

The England centre leads Saracens at London Irish on Saturday and the defence guru delivered an emphatic endorsement of his worth to the club, in the knowledge that his virtues are sometimes overlooked in the endless debate about the best midfield combination for the national team. ‘For me, unequivocally, Brad Barritt is the best centre in England bar none,’ he said. ‘He should be one of the first names down on an England team-sheet.

‘We are very lucky to have him. He has an unbelievably low error rate, he is incredibly physical as a ball-carrier and he is the best defensive centre in Europe – I don’t think there is much debate about that.

‘Not only is he a good defender, he is effective over the ball and gets us some key turn-overs, and his attacking game has grown. He’s got good, soft hands and puts in some deft little kicks, but that goes unnoticed because he has been pigeon-holed as not being a ball-player, which I think is unfair.’ 

In his own playing days, Gustard was an energetic, confrontational flanker at Leicester, London Irish and Saracens. He has taken his on-field persona into his work as a coach, to great effect. In June last year, he fulfilled a temporary role in Stuart Lancaster’s England set-up, while Andy Farrell was on Lions duty in Australia. It was a clear sign of his rising status and at some point, he would welcome a more permanent opportunity at Test level.

‘I was very fortunate that Stuart asked me to do it and that Saracens allowed me that opportunity,’ he said. ‘I had a great time. It was a challenge working with different players from different backgrounds, with different wants and needs, and difficult foibles and idiosyncrasies.

‘We did a good job, we got the players buying into what we were doing and we got the first series win in Argentina. I loved it and down the road, of course I would love it if that opportunity presented itself again, but at the moment they have a great coaching group.

‘At some stage I might get that chance but if it’s not with England, who knows? It might be with another country, or I might be head coach somewhere, or I might still be at Saracens, doing what we are doing.’

What they are doing today is trying to guard against any complacency after ‘nilling’ Harlequins. That shouldn’t be a significant danger because Irish beat them at Allianz Park last season and in Reading the season before, so the Exiles have proved more adept than most at breaking free from the Wolf-pack’s suffocating grip.

Gustard remembers every try his side concede in forensic detail. They pain him. He wants to stop them, so he will send Barritt and Co out at the Madejski Stadium with those same simple but effective orders. ‘Go get ‘em’.
