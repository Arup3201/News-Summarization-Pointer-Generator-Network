UKIP's Janice Atkinson caused outrage after referring to a Thai constituent as 'Ting Tong'

A Ukip MEP has apologised ‘profusely’ after calling a Thai constituent a ‘Ting Tong’.

Janice Atkinson, who represents the south east, was recorded making the comments after meeting Fa Munday, a mobile food seller in Ramsgate, Kent and her husband Vincent.

Mr Munday, a Ukip supporter, said the couple had been left shocked by the ‘outrageous’ comments.

‘It's a bit outrageous, her comments have come as a bit of a shock,’ he told BBC South East Today. ‘I'm quite offended.’

Ms Atkinson's comments were captured by the BBC team while she spoke to local people and Ukip members in Ramsgate.

She said: ‘..so that was good. We've got Fa who's, I dunno, she's a ting tong from somewhere.’

Ms Atkinson's remarks may have been influence by the BBC show 'Little Britain', which featured characters called Ting Tong, played by Matt Lucas, and Dudley, played by David Walliams

But the UKIP MEP insisted the comments were naive rather than malicious and said she was ‘incredibly sorry’ for offending the couple.

She said: ‘I deeply regret the words I used and am incredibly sorry. 

'It was poor judgment and naivety on my part rather than words spoken with any malice. 

'I am devastated that I have caused hurt and apologise profusely to both Mr and Mrs Munday.’

A Ukip spokesman said: ‘Janice has apologised for the words she used.

'Ukip in no way condones the use of language that may reflect prejudice or cause offence and we sincerely hope this matter can be resolved privately.’

The latest gaffe is a blow to the party, which has repeatedly inisted that it is not a racist party.

Before the European elections in May UKIP leader Nigel Farage was forced to pull the plug on a 'Carnival of colour' arranged to highlight the party's multi-ethnic supporter base.

Mr Farage was forced to abandoned the event in Croydon, South London, after campaigners clashed with party members.

The event was a follow-up to a rally Mr Farage held featuring candidates and members from ethnic minorities.

It came after Mr Farage was condemned by politicians from the three main parties after declaring in a radio interview that everyone knows ‘the difference’ between Romanians and Germans after saying he was uncomforble with the idea of a group of Romanian men moving in as neighbours.

He added: ‘Can we just have an honest appraisal of what has happened to post-communist Romania? Across the whole of the European Union, amongst all 28 member states, 7 per cent of all crime is committed by 240 Romanian gangs.’
