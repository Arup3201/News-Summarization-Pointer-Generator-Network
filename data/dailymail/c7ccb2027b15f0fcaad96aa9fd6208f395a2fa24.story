QPR goalkeeper Rob Green has been called up to the England squad for the upcoming internationals against Lithuania and Italy.

Green replaces Fraser Forster in Roy Hodgson's squad after the Southampton keeper was injured in the Saints' Barclays Premier League victory against Burnley on Saturday.

Tottenham left-back Danny Rose has also been drafted in after Manchester United's Luke Shaw withdrew due to injury, while Jack Butland has moved from the Under 21 squad to the senior.

Green has been capped 12 times by England but has only featured once for the Three Lions since he allowed Clint Dempsey's tame shot to squirm under his body and into the net during the 1-1 draw against the United States at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

He made his senior international debut against Colombia in 2005, but missed out on the 2006 World Cup in Germany after sustaining a groin injury in a B international match against Belarus a month before the tournament began.

Green has kept five clean sheets in 28 appearances for QPR this season. The Hoops, who host Everton at Loftus Road on Sunday, are currently four points from safety in 19th place.

England play Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on Friday, before facing Italy in an international friendly in Turin four days later.
