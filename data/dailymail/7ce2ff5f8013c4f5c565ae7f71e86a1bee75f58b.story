When Jack Colback smashed Sunderland’s third into the top corner of the Gallowgate End goal to crown last season’s 3-0 victory, Alan Pardew spun on his heels, sickened. He had also just identified his first summer signing.

Four months later, Colback was joining his hometown club on a free transfer. The bitter Black Cats tweeted a picture of his celebration at St James’ Park and a statement was released expressing their ‘dismay’ at his decision to quit the club who had ‘nurtured him’.

Colback and his new employers kept their counsel. Until now. The 25-year-old is the feature interview in tomorrow’s matchday programme and the cover carries an artist’s drawing of the black-and-white-clad midfielder with his hand on his heart.

Behind him rests a snow-covered Tyne Bridge. Newcastle’s message is clear: Jack’s back home.

Pardew has added to Sunderland’s sense of loss by admitting that Colback's man-of-the-match showing on Tyneside was the motivating factor behind their summer steal.

‘Jack’s performance in the derby was one of the reasons I signed him,’ he said.

‘The way he played on those big occasions told me a lot about the player. When I like a player and he performs in the big games it ticks a lot of boxes for me.

‘He has been a major thorn in our side in these fixtures so I'm just pleased he's not playing for Sunderland if I'm honest.’

The United boss added: ‘I think he feels a bit aggrieved about the way it ended at Sunderland.

‘But I think he's handled the move impeccably because he took a bit of criticism after it and he didn't respond, which I think is the right thing.

Alan Pardew has added extra spice to the Tyne-Wear derby by praising Colback's performances this season

Colback made 135 appearances for the Black Cats scoring five goals, including against Newcastle last season

‘His performances for us have been fantastic. He has grown in terms of having a different role here. I couldn't be more delighted with him and I'm sure Gus would mirror that.’

Does, then, Poyet mirror that affection?

‘He helped me a lot and I will remember that and I wish him well,’ said the Sunderland head coach.

‘Tomorrow (Sunday), I hope he has a stinker. But his character shows that he could have a special game.

‘My first few games here when I started playing him in the middle of midfield – they’d been playing him left-back – he got man-of-the-match and was stood there with a big bottle of champagne – he was enjoying it.

‘Of course, I would be happier for him now if he was somewhere else. It was a massive decision he took.’

Colback spent 14 years on the books at Sunderland and made his first team debut in 2009

Newcastle have come a long way since a legion of French players led to their manager being dubbed Alan Depardieu last season. Pardew could start five Geordies in the Tyne-Wear derby tomorrow, their most ever in the Premier League. Sunderland, on the other hand, are likely to field only one local lad — Sunderland-born Adam Johnson.

STEVEN TAYLOR

Born in London to a Newcastle family and relocated to the North East just weeks after his birth. Joined the esteemed Wallsend Boys Club before joining Newcastle’s youth academy.

SAMMY AMEOBI

While older brother and former Newcastle man Shola was born in Nigeria, Sammy was born and bred in Newcastle. He joined United’s academy in July 2008 and within three months had featured for the reserves.

PAUL DUMMETT

The defender joined Newcastle aged eight and worked his way through the academy, captaining the reserves on several occasions. After loans at Gateshead and St Mirren, Dummett made his breakthrough last season.

JAK ALNWICK

Born in Hexham, just outside Newcastle, Alnwick did not head straight for his local club. With big brother Ben at Sunderland, Alnwick followed suit before swapping for rivals Newcastle in 2008.

JACK COLBACK

Another to take the long road to Newcastle. The midfielder spent his formative years progressing through Sunderland’s youth academy but joined Newcastle on a free in June after his contract had expired.

Poyet, though, remains upset by Colback’s defection. And, in what could be considered a sly attempt to cast doubt over the player’s decision, he questioned the wider perception that Newcastle is a bigger club than Sunderland.

‘From the outside, for some reason, Newcastle are apparently a bigger club than Sunderland, but when you are here, you realise there is no difference,’ he said.

‘Maybe it’s because of the publicity Newcastle gets, the city centre or maybe even the airport, Sunderland does not have one.

‘It is easier to talk about Newcastle than Sunderland.’

Talk will turn to Sunderland, however, should they win a fourth straight derby for the first time in the fixture’s history.

Gus Poyet said he hopes his former player Colback has a 'stinker' on Sunday

Poyet said that he would prefer it if Colback was playing for a different team 

Poyet, with two victories of his own, has certainly absorbed the sense of separation in the region.

‘I agree with Roy Keane because you have to live it to know it,’ he said of the rivalry.

‘It is the cities. Mostly derbies are teams from the same city or two teams from different ones, really far away. This is different. We are near, almost connected to each other, but very different. Two different cities.

‘It is special. So close, yet unique. And the passion is really special.’

There has been an effort by both clubs to channel such passion onto the pitch, as opposed to vitriol in the stands and on the streets.

Pardew is cheered by the progress in this respect. Rather, his concerns lie with one of his players. Steven Taylor once said that no Sunderland player would get in Newcastle’s side and has been a target of supporters who once sang, ‘Steven Taylor, we wish you were dead’.

Manager Poyet insists that Newcastle are not a bigger club than his Sunderland

Taylor, who was sent off in his last home game against Chelsea, has already been called into the manager’s office for a quiet word.

‘I will be looking at one or two who maybe get emotionally involved,’ said Pardew.

‘Probably the one who worries me the most is Steven Taylor. He wears his heart on his sleeve and he plays like that sometimes in this fixture.

‘I've spoken to him about it. I think this time around he will be a lot calmer and if he plays he will be in better shape (to deal with the emotion).’

Sunderland have their own firebrand in the form of Lee Cattermole, who was red carded on his last appearance at St James’.

Alan Pardew said he has had a word with Steven Taylor about keeping his emotions in check on Sunday

Poyet, though, feels that characters such as Taylor and Cattermole define the intensity of the derby.

‘We normally try to motivate players but it is with a limit. Characters like Taylor and Cattermole, sometimes you need to bring them down,’ he said.

‘But it’s all part of this game, if Taylor and Cattermole weren’t there it would be a different game. It would be too soft – they add to the occasion.’

With Pardew and Poyet, Cattermole and Taylor, and not forgetting Colback, there is certainly no doubting the sense of occasion this time.
