Newcastle will step up their search for a new head coach on Sunday morning after caretaker boss John Carver and his team were booed off following defeat at Leicester.

Carver, who took over in temporary charge from Alan Pardew on Monday, insists he still wants the job full-time.

But the fans’ reaction to Saturday’s dismal defeat will not have helped his case and it is believed Steve McClaren and Rafa Benitez are front-runners to fill the vacancy.

Carver admitted he had not had any conservations with owner Mike Ashley since the departure of Pardew, who resigned to join Crystal Palace.

But he said: ‘I’d be a fool if I didn’t want to be head coach of this club. Obviously results dictates that happens but I don’t feel any different. I still want to be head coach.

‘I’ve not spoken to Mike and my only communication has been with [managing director] Lee Charnley on Monday night and a short conversation last night just about the game today.

‘It will be confusing [to fans] but the only thing I will say is that the position is not now as a manager — it’s now a head coach’s job. So the head coach’s job is to get the team ready and prepared for the next game and that’s all I’ve been thinking about.’

The likelihood is that the 49-year-old will still be in charge for next Saturday’s trip to Chelsea but the manner of the FA Cup exit could accelerate the process of finding a permanent successor.

McClaren, who has done an excellent job at Championship title contenders Derby, is likely to be at the top of any shortlist, alongside Benitez and former Swansea boss Michael Laudrup.

But McClaren on Sunday tried to distance himself from the vacancy following his team’s 1-0 win against Southport. ‘I’ve dismissed that link and I’m sticking to that,’ he said.

And Derby chief executive Sam Rush issued a hands-off warning on Saturday: 'There is no question whatsoever of him leaving.

'He is one of the highest-performing managers in English football, so he is going to be linked and admired by others. But we have had no approaches.'

Carver said Newcastle fans were within their rights to protest so audibly, with some also furiously gesturing for the players to go away rather than applaud. ‘It’s hugely embarrassing but they’re entitled to do that,’ he said.
