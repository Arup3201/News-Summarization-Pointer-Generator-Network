Theresa May has backed the possibility of a new grammar school in her constituency, despite laws which ban the creation of selective schools.

In a move which could herald a change in the Tory party's education policy, the Home Secretary indicated she would support a study which will look into opening a 'satellite' grammar school in Maidenhead, Berkshire.

The new state-funded selective school - which would be the first for a generation - would be a second 'satellite' campus joined to an existing grammar school in a nearby borough.

Because of that, it would avoid breaching laws which stop new selective schools being created.

It comes after Michael Gove, the former education secretary, ruled out a similar proposal in Sevenoaks, Kent, which would have taken up to 1,300 pupils.

Mr Gove - who was keen to revamp comprehensive schools - allowed a new free school to open on the site, instead. 

Ms May's willingness to consider the move sends a strong message about her stance on academic selection - a topic which is still hotly-debated among the Tory party. 

A statement on her website says the home secretary 'welcomed proposals to consider establishing a "satellite" grammar school site in Maidenhead', in response to parental demand.

Testing: Some grammar schools admit successful students by their grades in the 11-plus, while in other areas, pupils who pass the test are also ranked by admission criteria, such as the distance they live from the school

She said: 'Grammar schools attract considerable support from Maidenhead families. If a good school wishes to expand in line with existing legislation then this must be seriously considered.'

One of Ukip's policies is to allow existing schools to apply to become grammar schools.  

The proposal for the satellite campus has come from Windsor and Maidenhead council, which is looking to create more secondary school places in the area. There are currently no grammar schools in the borough, although there are several in neighbouring Buckinghamshire.

The Tory-run council says there will be a shortfall of 100 secondary school places in Maidenhead - which currently has a comprehensive education system - by 2020.

There are currently 164 grammar schools in England after many of them closed in the 1960s and 70s when there was a shift towards comprehensives. 

The establishment of any new wholly or partially selective state-funded schools is banned under the the former Labour government's School Standards and Framework Act 1998. However, existing schools are allowed to expand.

At present, some grammar schools admit successful students by ranked order - all candidates are ranked by their 11-plus score.

In other areas, pupils who pass the test are then ranked by admission criteria, which can include the distance they live from the school.

Those opposed to grammar schools argue that by dividing children at the age of 11 through taking an exam is socially divisive, and other schools in the surrounding area suffer, and richer children are more likely to succeed because their parents can afford extra tuition to get them through the test.

However, supporters say that academically bright children do better if they taught together.
