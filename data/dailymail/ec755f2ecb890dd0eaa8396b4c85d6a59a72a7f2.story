Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly has fired back at former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for calling New York women 'trashy' for swearing.

'I do have news for you before I let you go,' she told him on her show, The Kelly File, on Wednesday.

'We are not only swearing. We're drinking, we're smoking, we're having premarital sex with birth control, before we go to work and sometimes boss around a bunch of men.'

After Kelly, who lives in New York City, made the comments, Huckabee laughed, saying: 'I just don't want to hear that.'

Not impressed: Fox News' Megyn Kelly educated Mike Huckabee on the ways of the modern woman on her show on Wednesday after he said it was 'trashy' that New York women swore in the workplace

Her comments came after Huckabee, who quit his show on Fox News earlier this month, described his shock at hearing women swear in the workplace while he worked in New York.

'In the South, or in the Midwest, there in Iowa, you would not have people who would just throw the F-bomb or use gratuitous profanity in a professional setting,' Huckabee, 59, told host Jan Mickelson.

'In New York, not only do the men do it, but the women... My gosh, this is worse than locker-room talk. As we would say in the South, that's just trashy.'

After Politico published an article saying he had been referring to his female colleagues at Fox News, he sought to clarify what he had said. 

'I never said anything derogatory about the people at Fox News,' he told radio host Tyler Cralle, who is based in North Carolina, on Wednesday.

'I talked about the overall coarseness of conversation and gratuitous profanity that I hear in places in what I call the bubble zoo like New York, Washington and Hollywood.'

Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, announced earlier this month he is considering running for president. He is pictured after speaking at the Freedom Summit in Des Moines, Iowa on Saturday

He said it was 'an outright lie' that he was referring to women at Fox. 

Huckabee, who joined Fox in 2008, quit the network earlier this month as he announced he is thinking of running for president. He ran in the Republican presidential primaries in 2008.

The latest furor comes less that two weeks after he slammed Beyoncé and Jay-Z for their explicit lyrics in his book, and suggested that the rapper was 'exploiting his wife as a sex object'.

After making headlines for the comments, he told Fox News: 'You know, if people read the full chapter, it's in the context of, first of all, saying, "Beyoncé is a wonderful talent."

'My point is, she doesn't have to do some of the things that she does in the lyrics because it's not necessary. She has nothing to make up for. She's an amazing talent.'
