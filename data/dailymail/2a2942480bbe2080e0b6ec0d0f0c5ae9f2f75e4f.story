A Wyoming teen was charged as an adult for first-degree murder after he opened fire on a group of teens killing one and injuring another.

Tyler Burns, 19, suffered a gunshot wound to his stomach and begged for his life before 16-year-old Phillip Sam shot him in the head Oct. 5, in a public execution practically unheard of in the city of Cheyenne.

Burns died at a hospital one day after the shooting where Sam opened fire on 13 teens. The teens began to scatter until just Burns, Sam and a minor who was with Sam were left alone. 

Adult: Phillip Sam, 16, was charged as an adult for first-degree murder after he opened fire on a group of teens killing 19-year-old Tyler Burns in an execution-style murder

'I thought I should finish what I started. I didn't want him to suffer,' Sam told authorities. Sam has not yet entered a plea. 

Court records state that the minor who was with Sam told police that Burns begged Sam for for his life. But Sam walked up to Burns 'until he was at point-blank range' and shot him again twice.

The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports that Sam had agreed to meet at the park to fight one of the teens but instead immediately began shooting when he arrived at the scene.

Sam told police that he got a .40-calibur handgun from his mother's boyfriend and brought it to the park. 

Begged: Burns begged Sam for for his life after Sam shot him in the stomach, but Sam walked up to Burns 'until he was at point-blank range' and shot him again twice

Suffer: Sam told authorities that he shot Burns in the head because he didn't want him to suffer

In a preliminary hearing at Laramie County Circuit Court, Detective James Harper from Cheyenne Police Department stated that Sam said he brought the gun to the park because 'he didn't want to get jumped.'

Sam was also charged with 10 additional counts, according to the WTE, and is being held at a juvenile detention center on $250,000 bail.

Sam was charged as an adult, however, because he is a minor, the maximum penalty Sam could receive would be life in prison, the WTE reports. 

Each aggravated assault count Sam receives carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
