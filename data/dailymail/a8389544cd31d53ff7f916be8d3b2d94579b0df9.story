He’s had number one albums, streamed music from the surface of Mars and is now entering the smartwatch market alongside the likes of Samsung and Motorola.

Singer and entrepreneur Will.i.am revealed his wrist-worn device during an interview with Alan Carr on Friday night’s Chatty Man show.

He didn’t reveal full specifications, but said it has Bluetooth and will run Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. 

But after poor sales and criticism about wearables, will it be enough to make the tech fashionable?

Singer and entrepreneur will.i.am revealed his wrist-worn device, pictured, during an interview with Alan Carr on Friday night's Chatty Man show. He didn't reveal full specifications, but said it has Bluetooth and will run Twitter, Instagram and Facebook

Will.i.am’s watch was shown as having a curved display.

He didn’t reveal what operating system his device runs on, but the fact it
 features established apps including Instagram and Twitter, this 
suggests it will run on an existing software, likely to be Android.

The
 presence of Instagram also hints that the device will have a camera.

As the watch 
doesn’t link with a phone, but stores music, it suggests the watch will 
have a substantial amount of storage - which will need to be a minimum 
of 4GB to be useful.

If the watch has Bluetooth connectivity, it’s likely to also have Wi-Fi capabilities and may even add NFC.

Due to the fact it can make calls, the watch is also likely to have a SIM card and may additionally support 3G, or even 4G.

If it does come with a data plan, the storage may be reduced if music can be streamed from the cloud. 

During the show, will.i.am told Alan Carr: 'I don’t carry my phone anymore, this is my phone.

‘A lot of these smartwatches need phones - mine doesn’t need a phone.

'I started the company myself, I funded it, I used my own money to develop it.

So, it’s a phone. It has all my music in it so I can work out with it, without wires using Bluetooth headphones. It’s got Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.’

The following night, will.i.am used the watch to call Cheryl Cole during the final of talent show The Voice - although the call quality was poor and cut out shortly afterwards.

Samsung, Sony and Motorola have all released smartwatches - but each device has featured a flat screen.

By comparison, Will.i.am’s watch has a curved display.

He didn’t reveal what operating system his device runs on, but the fact it
 features established apps including Instagram and Twitter, suggests it will run on existing software, likely to be Android. 

It may even run the Tizen system seen recently on Samsung's Gear watch.

Samsung’s Galaxy Gear launched in September last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life.

It was also slammed for being too restrictive because it only worked with select Samsung devices.

Some analysts claimed the watch was rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market, beating Apple and Google to their still rumoured devices.

In November, Samsung declared it was the bestselling smartwatch ever, quoting sales figures of 800,000 - yet industry sources claimed this number was closer to 50,000 and the higher figure was actually the number of watches that had been shipped.

Windows Phone, for example, has fewer apps and Apple's iOS is a proprietary software used only on its own devices.

That is, of course, unless Will.i.am’s also developed a bespoke OS and custom-made versions of these apps. 

The presence of Instagram hints that the device will have a camera.

Will.i.am recently announced plans to release a camera accessory that will ‘dramatically enhance the clarity and definition of iPhone photographs’ called the i.am+.

It is said to be capable of raising the quality of photos from 8MP to 14MP and will.i.am’s watch may either run with an 8MP camera, or work with this accessory.

As the watch doesn’t link with a 
phone, but stores music, it suggests the watch will have a substantial 
amount of storage. This which will need to be a minimum of 4GB to be useful.

If the watch has Bluetooth connectivity, it’s likely to also have Wi-Fi capabilities and may even add NFC.

Prices for current smartwatches range from £109 to £299 and will.i.am's watch may retail for similar.

Aside from music, Will.i.am has a strong background in science and technology.

In
 2011, Intel named will.i.am as director of creative innovation and his 
role was to help develop the firm’s range of phones, tablets and 
laptops.

A year later he 
made history by streaming a song from the surface of Mars in conjunction
 with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. The song was 
called Reaching for the Stars.

Will.i.am's device will rival the likes of Samsung's range of Gear smartwatches and Motorola's Moto 360, pictured. Prices range from £109 to £299 for current smartwatches and will.i.am's watch may retail for similar

He also has plans to launch his own car company.
