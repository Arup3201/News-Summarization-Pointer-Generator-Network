Risk: Colorado governor John Hickenlooper said voters were 'reckless' to legalize marijuana in 2012

Colorado governor John Hickenlooper had admitted state voters were 'reckless' when they legalized recreational marijuana two years ago.

The democrat, who is seeking re-election for a second term, was asked what his advise to other states about the issue would be during a debate yesterday against  Republican challenger, Bob Beauprez.

Mr Hickenlooper recommended that states should think long and hard before legalizing pot because it can increase youth access to the drug.

He said Colorado's vote was reckless - but added that the state's job now was to properly regulate marijuana. 

He said: 'I would view it as reckless before we see what the consequences are.

'I think for us to do that without having all the data, there is not enough data, and to a certain extent you could say it was reckless.

'I'm not saying it was reckless because I'll get quoted everywhere, but if it was up to me I wouldn't have done it right? I opposed it from the very beginning. 

'In matter of fact, all right what the hell, I'll say it was reckless.'

Mr Hickenlooper, who once ran a successful brewpub, had opposed the decision to legalize the drug at the time of the November 2012 ballot. 

His opponent Mr Beauprez said he agrees with Hickenlooper about marijuana. The debate in Denver was hosted by business groups and mostly concerned the economy.

Marijuana has been legalized in two states - Washington and Colorado both passed the laws in 2012 - while a further 21 states have regulated so it can be used medicinally.

Since January 1, 2014, more than 200 licensed marijuana ‘dispensaries’ in Denver, Colorado’s biggest city — along with 100 more in other parts of the state — have been allowed to sell the drug to anyone aged 21 and over for purely ‘recreational’ rather than medicinal use.

A number of other states, including Oregon and Alaska, will vote this year on whether to take the same step, and polls from the Pew Research Center and Gallup have shown a majority of Americans support legalizing the drug.

Use in the U.S. has been on the rise since 2007, possibly due in part to a perception of diminishing risks. In 2008, research found that 42 per cent of people surveyed in the U.S. had tried marijuana at least once.

Hickenlooper is currently facing the toughest re-election fight of a charmed political career.

The two-time Denver mayor, former geologist and successful brewpub owner sailed into the governor's office four years ago over a divided Republican party that had nominated an unknown tea party favorite.

With a self-deprecating sense of humor and an emphasis on bipartisanship, Hickenlooper got begrudging praise from some Republican state lawmakers for his first two years in office. 

But a controversial death-penalty decision, a package of gun-control bills, and mishaps explaining his choices have put a dent in Hickenlooper's aura of invincibility.

Now, several polls suggest he's in a close race against Republican Bob Beauprez, a former member of the U.S. House.

'I'm going to win. I'm going to work hard enough,' Hickenlooper said. 'I mean, I spent 16 years in the restaurant business ... he's not going to outwork me. So, I am going to win, and this campaign is going to allow us to talk about the economy, and how are we going to create more jobs.'

Much of the firepower for Republicans has come from Hickenlooper's decision to grant an indefinite stay of execution last year to Nathan Dunlap, who was convicted for the 1993 slayings of four people at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant in Aurora, a suburb just east of Denver.

Hickenlooper's reprieve was not clemency, so he left the door open for a subsequent governor to execute Dunlap, leaving his fate unresolved.

'Since that moment ... he has to some extent been trying to play defense and recover,' said Floyd Ciruli, an independent Colorado pollster.

Despite the criticism, Hickenlooper said he believes his decision was correct.

'I don't think government should be taking people's lives. I just don't,' he said.

While Hickenlooper's popularity has waned, his Republican challenger has experienced a resurgence.

Once seen as a political laughingstock for losing the governor's race by 17 points in 2006, Beauprez has emerged as a solid contender for a Republican to win the state's top office for the first time since 2002.

'I don't want to sound overly casual about it, but the kind of geeky, aw shucks, nice guy veneer that the governor had, transitioned to (voters saying), 'What the heck is up with that?'' Beauprez said.

The buffalo rancher and former banker mostly disappeared from politics after his 2006 defeat. But he stayed on the radar enough through radio programs, a book he published and other writings. 

The work has provided ammunition for Democrats seeking to describe him as an ultra-conservative candidate who opposes abortion even in cases of rape, and who would threaten immigrant rights.

so close, that in the next two months, I think there's great potential for one of them, in my opinion, to shoot themselves in the foot,' Hill said. 'And then I will know, 'Yep, I'm going with this one, or I'm going with that one.'
