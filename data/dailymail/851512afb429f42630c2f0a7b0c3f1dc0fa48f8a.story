The beautiful game lived up to its name when Miss World 2013 winner Megan Young became Barcelona's newest fan.

The 24-year-old, holding a Barcelona shirt proudly, was honoured by the club's president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, as she pledged her support to the La Liga giants.

Young, the first woman from the Philippines to win the illustrious Miss World title, was present to see Barcelona awarded the Variety Humanitarian Award 2013 for its efforts in the education of children.

'Since the last World Cup, I have made many Barça friends who make me watch games and explain things about football,' said Young to Barcelona TV.

'It's great to learn about this fantastic team who we all now support.'

And a Barca shirt was just the present she was looking for.

'My friends and all Barcelona fans in the Philippines will envy me,' she added.

Battling with 127 other countries to win Miss World, the Philippine beauty can out on top to win the crown in Bali.

Now, with a Barcelona shirt, it only remains for her to see the team play for the first time.

Young is yet to see the team she now supports play, but made it clear that would be put right.

'When I return to Barcelona and Barca play at home, I will come with my friends to watch a game,' she said.
