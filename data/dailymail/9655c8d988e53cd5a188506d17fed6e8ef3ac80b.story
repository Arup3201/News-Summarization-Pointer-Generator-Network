Lukas Podolski has bemoaned his lack of opportunities at Arsenal as a transfer in the winter looks increasingly likely.

Speaking after Germany's 4-0 win over Gibraltar on Friday night, the striker criticised Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger for not giving him that chance at the Barclays Premier League club.

'I've spent the last four months making brief appearances,' he told reporters. 'I've had to wrap myself up warm in my winter coat with my hat and scarf on to watch the others playing.

'I would rather show Arsenal what I am capable if, but this chance to show what I can do is not being given to me.

'I want to play football for many years to come so am I meant just to say everything's fine and sit my contract out?'

The 29-year-old is not going to do that, vowing to seek talks with Arsenal management this winter and saying even a return to the Bundesliga is possible.

He added: 'Anything is possible nowadays. You can't rule anything out.'

Several clubs in Italy have already shown an interest in the forward, who picked up his 121st cap for Germany on Friday night and remains a firm part of Germany coach Joachim Low's plans.

Low has also advised Podolski to move in the winter to a club where he can play regularly again.
