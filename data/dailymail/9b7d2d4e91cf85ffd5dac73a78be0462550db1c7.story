Care home staff waited for 40 minutes before calling an ambulance after a 100-year-old dementia patient fractured her skull in a fall.

Great-grandmother May Ward, who was described as being ‘full of life’, was being lifted in a hoist from a chair to her bed when she fell 5ft and hit her head, an inquest heard yesterday.

Instead of immediately calling for help, Shasha Wei, from China, and Rumyana Ivanova, from Bulgaria, lifted her on to her bed and changed her bloody clothes.

May Ward, who died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her two carers were using to hoist her out of bed at Meppershall Care Home in August 2010

A 999 call for an ambulance was not 
placed until 40 minutes later. When paramedics arrived they discovered 
the former pub landlady heavily bruised and vomiting blood. She died the
next day in hospital.

Inquiries later revealed that Miss 
Wei and Miss Ivanova, who started working in the UK in 2009, were 
unfamiliar with the bucket sling and possibly moved her  too quickly.

The inquest heard Mrs Ward did not 
have the correct straps attached to her legs in the sling. This allowed 
her to pitch forward on to the floor when one of her carers let go of 
her.

A jury yesterday returned a verdict 
of accidental death at an inquest the two women were not asked to attend
because they had returned to their respective countries and were beyond
the coroner’s jurisdiction.

The Health and Safety Executive said it was investigating the case.

After the hearing Mrs Ward’s son 
John, 62, a retired Royal Mail manager, from Rugby, Warwickshire, said 
the family were ‘frustrated’ that the pair had not been available to 
explain the delay in calling for help.

‘They were key witnesses,’ he  said. ‘Now we may never know what really happened.

‘I am concerned about the 40 minutes –
the time between the accident happening and the paramedics arriving 
could have been a lifesaver.’

His wife, Lesley, 56, said: ‘It’s devastating. She was always pleased to see us, liked to chat and was full of life.’

May Ward and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west London before taking over the Prince William Henry pub (pictured) in Blackfriars, central London, according to her son

Coroner Edward Thomas said it was not
clear why Mrs Ward was moved by her carers after her fall because they 
were not present. ‘They should not have moved her,’ he added.

He would be writing to the Care Quality Commission to ask them to ‘look more closely at care in homes’.

Mrs Ward had been living at 
Meppershall Care Home in Shefford, Bedfordshire, for six years when she 
was fatally injured on August 27, 2010.

The home received a 'poor' rating in a Care Quality Commission (London offices pictured) inspection report around the same time as manager Judith Eglen started working there in December 2009

May Ward's son, John Ward, said she was born in West Tottenham, north London, and met her husband William Ward while she was a cook in the RAF.

Her husband died in 1989, after the two had successful careers as publicans. Ms Ward has four grandchildren and six great grand-children - three girls and three boys, her son said.

She and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west London before taking over the Prince William Henry pub in Blackfriars, central London, according to Mr Ward.

They retired in 1980 and moved to Kenton, Middlesex, and Ms Ward was taken into care in 2004. 

The care home manager at the time, Judith Eglen, was sacked in the wake of Ms Ward's death, the inquest heard.

She began work at the home in December 2009, around the same time it received a zero-star, or ‘poor’, rating in a Care Quality Commission inspection report, the jury heard.

That was uprated by the watchdog to a one-star rating in May 2010, around three months before Ms Ward's death and around the same time the new slings were purchased.

Ms Eglen told the court that she and the two carers involved re-enacted the lead-up to Ms Ward's fall for her family and the deputy manager a few days after her death.

She said Ms Ward was dropped from about 5ft but the carers were ‘good’ at their jobs.

‘Our conclusion (after re-enacting the fall) was that they did everything correctly but they moved too quickly,’ Ms Eglen told the court.

The widow, whose husband William, a 
former RAF chef, died in 1989, had previously been in good physical 
health. Months earlier she had received a telegram from the Queen 
marking her centenary.

Detective Constable Philip Freebrey told the 
inquest in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, that both carers said Mrs Ward 
became agitated when she was moved.

‘Shasha was controlling the hoist device and Rumyana was supporting Mrs Ward,’ he said.

‘She was let go by one of the carers,
causing her to jerk forward out of the sling to the ground. The sling 
was in perfect working order. It would appear from later investigations 
that it was not used correctly.’

Health and Safety Executive officer 
Ruth Boulton said: ‘There was evidence that the carers had been trained 
to use a sling before but not this particular device.

‘The language barrier, though they could speak English, could have made a difference to the care.’

Former care home manager Judith 
Eglen, who was sacked four months after Mrs Ward’s death, described how 
Miss Wei and Miss Ivanova showed her what had happened before the fall.

‘She was hoisted about the height of 
the bed before she slipped and fell,’ she said. ‘My initial report 
indicated that the carers had perhaps moved her too quickly.’

Nurse Beatrice Ngarama, who was 
called to treat Mrs Ward, said: ‘When I got to her, her face was 
obviously swollen and she was already changed and in bed.

‘I wouldn’t have moved her from the 
floor because I did not know the extent of her injuries.’ A post mortem 
examination showed Mrs Ward died from two fractures of the skull and a 
brain haemorrhage. Her right leg was also broken.

In November 2009, a Care Quality 
Commission inspection found ‘significant shortfalls’ at the care home, 
which is owned by GA Projects Ltd, including ‘moving and handling’ of 
patients.

Bedfordshire Police said it had 
considered neglect charges against Miss Wei and Miss Ivanova but dropped
the case due to ‘insufficient evidence’.

The Health and Safety Executive can 
bring criminal charges against employees, directors and companies. A 
spokesman said: ‘We cannot comment while an investigation is live.’
