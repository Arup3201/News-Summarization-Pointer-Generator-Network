It's billed as the race that stops a nation and the Melbourne Cup didn't disappoint as racegoers turned Flemington into party central on Tuesday.

More than 100,000 punters flocked through the gates and thousands more around the country enjoyed countless lunches, parties and glamorous functions to get in the spirit of Australia's biggest horse race.

But as the day went on, so did the shenanigans, leaving some punters a little worse for wear.

Obviously these two have had a big day, opting to relax on the picnic rug

Some opted to ditch the heels and go bare foot, while others ripped off their ties and used the floor as a seat and thank goodness for the trusty old picnic rug where a number of race goers ended up taking a snooze to sleep off a hard day.  

So now it's just a wonder, will these hard partying race goers get to work tomorrow, there just might be a few that call in sick!

Back on the turf, British jockey Ryan Moore was celebrating after a storming finish on German stallion Protectionist landed the prize.

Red Cadeaux was second, Who Shot Thebarman third while Signoff came home in fourth.

There was a sad end to the day for connections of Admire Rakti as the favourite had to be put down in his return from the track after fading and finishing last.
