Target: Charles Dickens was the victim of an attempted attack on his carriage  in 1862

Charles Dickens is today venerated as one of England's greatest ever literary heroes - but he was not always treated with such respect.

Newly rediscovered records reveal that at the height of his fame, the celebrated novelist was targeted by thugs who tried to overturn his carriage on his journey home.

Dickens also had hay stolen from his home at Gad's Hill Place near Rochester in Kent, and complained about rubbish from the local pub being thrown into his garden.

His struggles with the neighbours came to light in a series of newspaper cuttings from the British Newspaper Archive which have been unearthed by Bygone Kent magazine.

The author moved into Gad's Hill in 1856, using the money he had earned from novels such as Oliver Twist, A Chrismas Carol and David Copperfield.

He used to take the train from London to Higham, the nearest station to his home, before getting in a horse-drawn carriage to take him the rest of the way.

But in June 1862, his regular route almost got him in trouble - as reported by local paper the South Eastern Gazette, which wrote about a 'diabolical attempt to overturn Mr C. Dickens' carriage' by farm worker James Stedman.

Dickens was supposed to arrive at Higham at 10.30pm to be met by his groom, James Marsh, but he missed the train and the groom returned to Gad's Hill.

The newspaper reported: 'A little distance on he found two rollers lying across the road, which, had they not been perceived in time, would have caused serious mischief.

'James Munn, a fellow workman of the prisoner, had accompanied Stedman from Strood to Higham by the 9.30, and when passing through the village saw Mr Dickens' carriage drive down to the station.

'The prisoner immediately afterwards went into a field and drew the two rollers across the road to upset the carriage on its return. Munn at the time held the gate open for the prisoner.'

After the incident, Stedman sought refuge in a pub across the road from Dickens' home, where he played skittle - but was soon caught by the police.

He was charged at Rochester Magistrates' Court with 'placing a horse-roller, and also a hand roller, on the middle of the turnpike road, at a late hour on Saturday night, with the intention of upsetting the carriage of Mr C. Dickens, which was returning from the Higham railway station'.

Stedman pleaded drunkenness as his excuse, but a month later it emerged that he had done the same thing on a different road in a bid to overturn someone else's carriage, and he was sentenced to two months' hard labour.

In 1859, George Blackman was jailed for three days after he stole hay from Dickens' home, which was one of the grandest in the area.

Rubbish dumping was also a concern for Dickens, as in 1858 he was forced to write to a local pub landlord who continuously left his property a mess.

Dickens wrote: 'Mr Charles Dickens begs Mr Strood to be so good as to give directions that no rubbish or refuse from the Falstaff to be thrown into the shrubbery of Gad's Hill Place.

'Mr Dickens also hopes that Mr Strood will advise his customers not to trespass on that ground, in going from the Falstaff to the village.

'He wishes very earnestly to live on good terms with his neighbours of all degrees and he hopes that they know it, and will not fee disinclined to respect his property.

'He is sure that Mr Strood can have no desire not to do what is obliging and right, he therefore addresses this note to Mr Strood in good will and good humour.'

It was reported on another occasion that Dickens was forced to add a padlock to his cellar after locals broke in and stole champagne for a party.

The author died at Gad's Hill in 1870, at the age of 58. The home is now a private school.

Andrew Rootes, editor of Bygone Kent, said: 'I was brought up in the village of Higham, near where Dickens lived, and have always been an admirer, so was delighted to alight upon this incident tucked away in the British Newspaper Archive.

'Stedman was a fairly hopeless type of criminal, nowhere as impressive as the list of malefactors in Dickens's novels, but worthy of a minor role.'
