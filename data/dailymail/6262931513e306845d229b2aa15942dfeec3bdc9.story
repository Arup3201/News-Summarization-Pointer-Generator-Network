Henrik Stenson was angry with tournament officials after two late mistakes cost him victory in the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill on Sunday.

Stenson had seen his two-shot overnight lead turned into a two-shot deficit in the space of eight holes, but fought back to reclaim the outright lead with six holes of the final round to play.

However, the Ryder Cup star - who had played the final four holes in four under par on Friday and Saturday - three-putted the 15th for a bogey and did the same for par on the 16th after finding the green in two.

And American Matt Every took full advantage with a birdie from 15 feet on the 18th to complete a closing 66, which made him the third player in the tournament's history to successfully defend the title.

Stenson was unhappy at being timed for slow play on the back nine, telling reporters: 'I'm obviously a little disappointed with the outcome.

'I'm as much disappointed with the PGA Tour officials for putting us on the clock on 15, starting to chase us down the stretch. It's busy enough trying to close out a golf tournament and to play the finishing holes without being on the clock. I did not see the reason for that really.'

Every, who was four behind heading into the final round last year and three adrift of Stenson on Sunday, said: 'Last year I just made everything but this year I was driving it really well and my irons were spot on.

'I kind of had a feeling. I was shaking some of those putts in but the one on 18, straight downhill, that's what you want when under pressure so that was nice.'

World number one Rory McIlroy finished eight shots behind the winner after a closing 70, but expressed his satisfaction with his form ahead of his bid to win a third major title in succession and complete the career grand slam in next month's Masters at Augusta.

'I feel like I got what I wanted out of the week, four good competitive rounds,' McIlroy told Sky Sports 4. 'I saw some progress on some of the things I was working on last week. I still need to work on some things ahead of Augusta.

'I am excited going there with the opportunity to achieve three in a row, the career grand slam. It's a nice position to be in. I'm going to embrace it, try not to build it up too much. I know it's a big deal but hopefully I can get my game as good as I possibly can.'
