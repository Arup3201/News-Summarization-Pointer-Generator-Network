MPs will debate 'full disclosure' of all documents relating to the Hillsborough disaster in Parliament today after 100,000 people signed online petition in support of the move.

There has already been an inquest into the tragedy in which 96 Liverpool fans lost their lives on April 15 1989 as their team played Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup semi-final.

However, the families of the victims dispute the findings of the single inquest into all 96 deaths which ruled the victims had all sustained their fatal injuries by 3.15pm.

The victims' families believe the government files will shed new light on the catastrophe and David Cameron has given his backing to the process.

Mr Cameron offered his support in a letter to Andy Burnham, who initiated the full disclosure process on the 20th anniversary of the disaster,

'Justice for the 96': Liverpool fans still display banners in reference to the Hillsborough disaster, which will be debated in Parliament tonight after 100,000 people signed an online petition

In the letter, published by The Mirror, 
Mr Cameron wrote: 'The Government is committed to full disclosure of the
Hillsborough information it holds. We have proposed that disclosure 
takes place to the families prior to wider publication.'

In particular, they are keen to see the minutes of a cabinet briefing which they say took place the following day between the then-Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher and senior officers at South Yorkshire Police.

It was three days after the meeting that The Sun newspaper published an infamous story, quoting an unnamed police source, which blamed the disaster on a group of drunken Liverpool fans.

The article, which was subsequently heavily discredited by Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry, also claimed some Liverpool fans had pickpocketed the dead and urinated on police as they tried to control the situation.Â 

Taylor's report into the disaster in August of the same year said: 'Not a single witness was called before the inquiry to support any of those allegations.'

The anger it created in Liverpool led to a boycott of the paper in the city that remains in place today despite efforts to apologise.

The chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group has today called on The Sun to reveal the identity of the unnamed police source quoted in the story.

Margaret Aspinall, who lost her 18-year-old son James in the disaster told The Guardian: 'If we are now to discover the real truth, let the Sun tell us who gave them those lies which caused so much damage.

'If the Sun wants to make amends, they should reveal who it was, not allow their sources to hide behind anonymous briefings 22 years later, and help the families to understand what happened.'

The families believe a major incident plan was never initiated by South Yorkshire Police meaning crushed fans were denied emergency and potentially lifesaving medical attention.

The families also dispute the findings of the single inquest into all 96 deaths which ruled the victims had all sustained their fatal injuries by 3.15pm.

This meant the coroner did not hear any evidence of what happened after that point - even though many bereaved families believe their loved ones could still have been alive.

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. The families say it is an injustice that no individual or organisation has been held fully to account for the disaster.

Writing about the issue on his blog today, The Guardian's media commentator Roy Greenslade said: 'The South Yorkshire force had a motive - to distract attention from its own failings, as highlighted by Taylor - and the opportunity to brief journalists off the record.'

However, he also points out that he doesn't think the The Sun revealing the name of the source would shed much new light on the subject.

'It is possible that the release of internal police documents will point a finger towards an individual, though I somehow doubt it,' he wrote.

Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to restate the government's position is a 'commitment to full transparency about the Hillsborough disaster through full public disclosure'.

However, there are some issues surrounding the legality of publishing the documents because standard practise maintains that those details are not usually published for 30 years.

The documents set to be disclosed will include cabinet papers from the time, but it is as yet unclear if that tranche of information will include the meeting between Thatcher and South Yorkshire police.

A panel of independent experts has been established to examine the documents, and will then report on what the new details add to the public understanding of the disaster.

It is the second petition to be debated in the Commons since the coalition introduced the e-petition system. MPs considered the riots last week, and are also set to discuss British membership of the European Union.
