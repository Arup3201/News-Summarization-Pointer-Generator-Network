An Israeli judge has ruled that the death of pro-Palestinian activist Rachel Corrie in Gaza in 2003 was an accident

The mother of a US activist who was killed after being hit by an army bulldozer while protesting in the Palestine, has slammed an Israeli court after a judge described the death as a 'regrettable accident'.

Rachel Corrie, from Washington, was 23 when she was killed while forming part of a human shield trying to prevent the destruction of homes in Rafah on the Gaza Strip in 2003.

Today a judge in Haifa, Israel, said her death was an accident that she had brought on herself by entering a closed military zone at the height of the second intifada.

But Rachel's mother Cindy Corrie, who was in 
court to hear the verdict with her husband and surviving daughter, maintains the bulldozer driver would have seen her daughter so it could not have been accidental.

Mrs Corrie said 
the family intends to appeal to Israel’s high court.

She told reporters: 'We are deeply saddened and troubled by what we heard today
in the court.

'This was a bad day, not only for us, but for human 
rights, humanity, the rule of law and the country of Israel.

'We believe Rachel Corrie was seen. Everything through this process confirmed at least one soldier saw her.

'We believe the bulldozer driver had the ability and responsibility to see what was in front of his machine.'

Corrie and other members of the International Solidarity Movement had been acting as human shields to prevent the bulldozing of Palestinian homes in Rafah on the Gaza-Egypt border. 

The Israeli army said the buildings were being used to attack Israeli soldiers and as covers for entrances to weapons smuggling tunnels beneath the border.

Judge Oded Gershon dismissed a civil lawsuit brought by Corrie’s family against the state of Israel claiming symbolic damages of $1. 'I reject the suit,' the judge said. 'There is no justification to demand the state pay any damages.'

Reading from his 162-page verdict, the 
judge told the Haifa District Court that Corrie’s death was a 
'regrettable accident' but could have been avoided if she had obeyed 
warning signs and a travel ban on the Gaza Strip issued by the US to its
citizens.

The area had been formally declared 'a closed military zone' by the Israeli army, banning all civilians from entering.

The judge added: 'She did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done.'

He
rejected the claim of negligence, saying the driver of the bulldozer 
could not see her. 'She consciously put herself in harm’s way,' Gershon 
said.

The driver testified that he did not see Corrie or even know he had hit her until after the accident.

The
judge critcised the International Solidarity Movement, saying it 'abuses 
the human rights discourse to blur its actions which are de facto 
violence.'

Mrs Corrie said after the verdict: 'We are deeply saddened and troubled by what we heard today in the court. This was a bad day, not only for us, but for human rights, humanity, the rule of law and the country of Israel'

The judge continued: 'This included 
an army of activists serving as 'human shields' for terrorists wanted by
Israeli security forces, financial and logistical aid to Palestinians 
including terrorists and their families.'

But the Corrie family said the judge had 
effectively whitewashed an earlier military investigation that was not 
the 'thorough, credible and transparent' probe promised by the Israeli 
government.

Their lawyer, Hussein Abu Hussein said: 'US 
diplomats, who were in court to hear the verdict, had also complained 
that the Israeli army had failed to properly investigate the incident.

'We
believe the decision does not comply with international law,' said , vowing to appeal the 
verdict to Israel’s highest court.
