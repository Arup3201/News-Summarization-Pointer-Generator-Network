A western lowland gorilla has been born at London Zoo as part of breeding programme for critically-endangered species.

Following an eight and a half month gestation period, 15-year-old mother Mjukuu gave birth to the baby, her second infant, last night.

The new arrival was discovered by delighted Zoo staff this morning. Gorilla keeper Daniel said: 'We are thrilled with the birth of a baby gorilla here at ZSL London Zoo and mum and infant are both doing really well.

Western lowland gorillas  are classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Their numbers have drastically reduced in the last two decades - by more than 60 per cent. 

Found in tropical rainforests of Angola Cameroon; Central African Republic; Congo; Equatorial Guinea; Gabon, illegal poaching, disease, and habitat loss have all been blamed for the species dwindling numbers.

Scientists estimate that even if all the threats to the gorillas were removed, it would take the population some 75 years to recover.

West lowland gorillas are now part of the European Endangered Species Breeding Programme (EEP) to boost their numbers.

'Mjukuu gave birth overnight, surrounded by the rest of the troop – who all seem very pleased, and quite intrigued, by the new arrival.

'Western-lowland gorillas are critically endangered in the wild, so this infant is a really important addition not only to the Zoo, but for the European conservation breeding programme.'

The infant is the first offspring of the Zoo's silverback male Kumbuka, who arrived in May 2013 from Paignton Zoo.

Kumbuka quickly settled in to life at London, and took his role as group leader in his stride.

Female Mjukuu soon won the attention of the strapping silverback, and keepers were delighted when she fell pregnant less than a year after he arrived.

London Zoo has now released a video of mother and baby where Mjukuu is seen gently cradling the newborn and hugging it towards her.

A Zoo spokesman said the protective mother was keeping her baby very close and would often been seen 'stare lovingly' at the new addition to the family.

Keepers will now leave the infant in the capable hands of mother Mjukuu allowing her to bond with her new baby, and allow the rest of the troop to get to know the new arrival.
