Marouane Fellaini believes Manchester United have what it takes to finish in the top four this season and insists they can become champions again next year.

United entered the international break on a high after their 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday.

The victory stretched their lead over their arch-rivals to five points, with fourth-placed United only eight points adrift of Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea with as many games to go.

While Fellaini expects Jose Mourinho's men to lift the title in May, he has backed Louis van Gaal's side to become real contenders next season.

'I think Chelsea will win it (this year),' said Fellaini, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail. 'We need to be there next season to show everyone that we can be champions again. To do that we must work hard and to improve too.'

For now, returning to the Champions League is the priority for Fellaini and United after their season-long absence from the elite European stage.

Van Gaal's side face a difficult run-in to close the campaign with games against Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal all to come.

But the win at Anfield inspired renewed optimism and Fellaini is confident that United will get over the line and finish in the top four.

'It's massive because this season we didn’t play the Champions League,’ he said.

'So, for a team like Manchester United, we need to make sure we qualify for next season.'

The Belgium international, 27, is finally becoming a force on the field for United after enduring a difficult start following his £27.5million arrival from Everton 18 months ago.

And he credits the influence of boss Van Gaal behind his revival.

'Van Gaal is good,' said Fellaini. 'He has his philosophy, his own tactics. He has a vision for the team and he knows what he wants from the players, so it is good to work with him.

'I’ve played more games this season, so that is good personally.

'However, this season we haven’t won a trophy but I now hope we finish in the top four to play Champions League.

Fellaini is part of boot makers New Balance's first football advert launch and follows in the footsteps of United legend Bryan Robson, who famously wore the brand during his playing days.

'Bryan Robson was a great player for United, so it is good to see a player like that play with New Balance,' he said.

'I will need to perform at my best to carry on the high standard of players to wear the boots.'

As Fellaini paid tribute to 'Captain Marvel', he also found time to salute United's current skipper, Wayne Rooney.

'Rooney is a great guy, he is a very great guy and a great captain as well,' said Fellaini. 'He knows how to talk to the players and to take responsibility.'
