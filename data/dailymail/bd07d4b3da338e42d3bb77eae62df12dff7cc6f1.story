Mother-of-three Rania Alayed, 25, was reported missing from her home on July 2 but police have revealed she was last seen more than a month ago

The husband of a missing mother-of-three and his brother have both been charged with her murder.

Rania Alayed, 25, was reported missing from her Manchester home on July 2 but police believe she may have disappeared more than a month ago.

Her husband Ahmed Khatib, 33, and his brother Muhanned Mahmood Al Khatib, 38, have now both been charged with murder and perverting the course of justice.

Muhanned Mahmood Al Khatib is due to appear before Manchester magistrates today.

Police now believe Rania was last seen on Friday, June 7, at around 7.30pm near Arthur Millwood Court, Salford.  Her body has not yet been found.

Greater Manchester Police said Rania had only moved to Manchester in January this year.

Rania's former neighbours in Norton, Stockton, Teeside, have told of their shock at her disappearance.

Michael Mannion, 35, who lives two doors down from Rania's former home, said: 'She was always polite and always spoke to you.

'I'm shocked to think that something could happen to such a nice lass. It's a real shame. She was always sound.'

Mark Sharp, 42, added: 'Our kids used to play with theirs. I thought she was a decent woman but you never saw her out.'

Sean Hamilton, 23, who lives nearby, added: 'At the end of the day she was a canny lass. I'm really shocked.'

Police have also bailed a 64-year-old man and a 55-year-old woman until August 19 pending further inquiries.

Investigation: Police outside the homes of Rania's husband Ahmed Khatib in Gorton, Manchester, after he was charged with murder of the missing mother-of-three
