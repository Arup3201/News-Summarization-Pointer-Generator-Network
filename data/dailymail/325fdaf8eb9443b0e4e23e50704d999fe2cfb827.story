With the rain pouring and the wind howling, the conditions perhaps weren’t the best for cycling - even on an A or B road.

But one cyclist was today labelled a ‘dummy’ by traffic police after officers had to escort him off the London-bound M1 motorway near Redbourn, Hertfordshire, next to cars travelling at 70mph.

Cycling on motorways in Britain is illegal - but that didn't stop the unnamed rider trying his luck on a bicycle with no lights, wearing a green hooded jacket, black trousers and a dark backpack.

Not the best idea: Officers had to escort the man off the London-bound M1 near Redbourn, Hertfordshire

Police officers spoke to the man, who was on his way to London, and he will now take a train instead.

A Hertfordshire Constabulary spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We were alerted just before midday today of a man travelling southbound on the M1 on a pushbike.

‘We did a very slow escort off with him at the next junction, which was junction 9 at Redbourne. We gave him words and advice, and I believe he's now getting a train. He was planning to go to London.’

Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit said on Twitter: ‘Somebody thought it was ok to cycle to London on the M1, escorted safely off at Redbourn. #dontbeadummy.’

Unimpressed: Officers spoke to the man, who was on his way to London, and he will now get a train instead

In June police spoke to another cyclist after escorting her off the M1 near Milton Keynes to an overhead bridge. Cycling on motorways is banned under section 253 of the Highway Code.

Other road users prohibited to travel on motorways include riders of motorcycles under 50cc, horse riders, certain slow-moving vehicles, agricultural vehicles and powered wheelchairs.

One famous example of cyclists on UK motorways came during the 2002 Commonwealth Games, when two members of the Kenyan cycling team were stopped on the M61 near Bolton.

Greater Manchester Police pulled over George Ochieng, 23, and Arthur Kamu, 27, who had spent 45 minutes cycling in full kit on the hard shoulder at up to 40mph, travelling more than 17 miles.

Mr Ochieng said that he and his team-mate were unaware of British laws banning them from cycling on motorways. A police spokesman confirmed the force understood it was a ‘genuine mistake’.
