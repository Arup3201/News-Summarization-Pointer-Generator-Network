This is the heart-stopping moment a kayaker is rescued from drowning by his quick-thinking colleagues. 

During a trip down the Wilson Creek a National Wild and Scenic River located in the Pisgah National Forest near Collettesville, North Carolina, a kayaker toppled over and his head became pinned beneath the surface of his kayak. 

Without being able to break free, his head was trapped, but luckily nearby, kayakers Markham Shuskey, Corey Edwards, Jake Matheny, Michael Barbre, and Matt Dolian were out on the water that day.

Barbre and Dolian quickly went into action and managed to rescue the man in the nick of time.

It all appears to be a routine paddle at the start of the video, but then muffled screams heard some yards behind lead the team of four to surge into action.

The angle of the upturned kayak to the rocks mean the stricken man's head is trapped in the flow of the water, meaning breathing becomes impossible.

Although shallow waters, the position of the rocks make even this a difficult route to navigate

After a few tugs and somewhat of a struggle, the man is finally pulled out of the water, giving a relieved thumbs up. 

The pristine and rugged landscape of Wilson Creek make it hugely popular for kayaking, camping, hunting and fishing, waterfall hikes, off-road driving, and mountain biking.

Kayakers plunge through rapids with names like 'Boatbuster' and 'Thunderhole' in what is recognized as one of the most challenging runs in the southeastern United States.
