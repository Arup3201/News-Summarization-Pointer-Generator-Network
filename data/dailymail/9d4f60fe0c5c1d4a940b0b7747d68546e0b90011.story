A mother whose weight ballooned to 19st after snacking on crisps and chocolate every two hours has shed more than nine stone. 

Rachel Baker, 32, from Addlestone, Surrey, had gained weight steadily since her teens, eating big meals including frozen ready meals and takeaways and frequently snacking on crisps, chocolate and fizzy drinks.

Her weight crept up to 19 stone after giving birth to son, and she realised that she couldn’t bend down to tie her shoelaces without getting breathless.

Her doctor had also warned that her body mass index (BMI) was 'off the chart'.

Ms Baker  was always overweight as a teenager, but after putting on three stone after the birth of her son, now two, her weight spiralled out of control. She became so obese a doctor said her BMI was 'off the scale'

A doctor told her she was so obese that her BMI, previously 43 before her pregnancy, was now off the scale, and this spurred her to lose weight through the LighterLife diet plan and taking more exercise.

LighterLife is a diet plan in which food is replaced with ready-mixed packs or shakes which contain all the nutrients a person's body would need in a day, but totalling only 600 calories.

Ms Baker also attended weekly weighing and counselling sessions which helped her learn how to cook healthy meals, avoid the urge to eat and keep the weight off long-term. 

Since shedding the weight 11 months ago Ms Baker says she is able to race around with her son and now has achieved her goal of looking elegant while driving a carriage.

Mrs Baker said: 'I realised I was holding my breath to do up my shoes and the shock of this was my lowest point.

‘I had the big tire around my middle. It was pressing on my chest so I couldn’t breathe.

‘Then I thought “I wonder how heavy I am”.

'I wasn't paying attention because I was running around after my son. I was looking after him but not after myself.

‘My son is young and active and I didn’t want to miss any moments while he was playing sports or running around outside’

Ms Baker said she had been overweight since her teenage years.

She said: ‘I’ve always been bigger. I remember being 13 in secondary school and having meetings with the school dietitian because I was bigger than I was supposed to be.

Ms Baker decided to join LighterLife's weight loss programme and through changing her diet and carrying out exercise, she managed to lose nearly 10 stone in under a year

A doctor said Ms Baker's BMI, which was over 43, was so high it was 'off the scale'. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25

Malteasers as a dessert 

‘I was always conscious that I was bigger than my friends.’

At age 22, she decided to lose weight and went to the gym, even running a 5km Race for Life. 

But after the birth of her son she could no longer maintain such an exercise regime.

She said her pregnancy weight, combined with a lack of exercise and a near-addiction to unhealthy food, meant her weight began to soar.

She said: ‘I love food, I love Italians, Chinese, Mexican, Indian.

‘I always ate dessert, that was the pleasing part of the meal.

‘My intake was high but my exercise was low.

‘Then I got pregnant and put on an extra three stone. The amount of food that went into my body was just incredible.'

She added she didn’t realise her weight was so high: ‘When you put on a couple of pounds a month, you don’t notice. 

'If your jeans get a bit tight you don’t really notice, you just wear something else in your wardrobe.’

The moment she realised she was breathless bending down to tie her laces was the ‘trigger’ moment.

After this she went to her GP, who confirmed that her BMI, which was 43 before she became pregnant, was now so high it was ‘off the scale’.

Ms Baker was officially classed as 'morbidly obese' at over 43, well outside the healthy range of 18.5 to 25. 

She looked around for a weight loss programme

‘I was conscious of Pauline Quirke’s story. That’s when I found LighterLife.

'I went for a consultation and I liked the weekly group sessions. After I’d done a couple of weeks I didn’t worry about not being with my family. I enjoyed it, it was time for me.

'We didn’t talk about dieting and calories and food. It was like life lessons. It was about identifying the eating triggers. We did things like worry trees.

'So we resolved our life issues so we didn’t need food to solve it.

'Tiredness was a big factor for me. I had a time between 7 and 8, after dinner, child in bed, and that time was snack time.

'I would pick up something that I wouldn’t need for nutrition.'

Sticking to the diet, she managed to lose between two and six pounds a week, eventually shedding almost 10 stone.

Ms Baker’s hobby is horse carriage driving and so she decided to set herself a goal of losing weight so she could feel graceful at the reins.

She said: ‘I have been driving carriages for two and a half years. I show my mother’s horse and drive around the country showing the horse.

‘When I was getting to the end of the season, I was going into a new class where I needed a sense of elegance.

She has finally achieved her goal of looking elegant while carrying out her hobby of horse carriage driving. Before her weight loss she says she felt 'cumbersome', 'like a workman' and struggled getting on the horse

Before losing weight Ms Baker said she would have struggled sitting down cross-legged for a picnic, but with her trim physique she is able to enjoy picnics with her son

‘I felt very cumbersome. I felt like a workman like rather than elegant. I found it hard to get on and off the horse which is embarrassing.

‘So I aimed to start the year confident and elegant, with a lovely hat. To feel as if I belonged more. And now I do!’

One of the greatest joys of losing weight is that she is now able to play with her son, she said.

‘My son loves picnics but I would have struggled to sit cross legged before on the ground, and my knees would hurt getting up. Now I can have a picnic without worrying.'

She added: ‘Now I run around with my son, I race him while he’s on the bike. He always says "chase me chase me!" and I can now.’
