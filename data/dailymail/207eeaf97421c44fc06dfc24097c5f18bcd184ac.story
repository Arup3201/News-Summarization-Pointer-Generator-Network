Rick Perry today became the biggest Republican name to back an Israeli air strike on Iran, as fears mount about the country's nuclear capabilities.

The Texas Governor said he would support Israel on the matter if there is proof Tehran is moving closer to having a nuclear weapon.

His comments come as it was claimed Britain and the U.S. are drawing up plans to attack Iran amid growing tensions in the Middle East.

Republican candidate: Rick Perry said he would support an Israeli air strike on Iran if there is proof Tehran is moving closer to having a nuclear weapon

‘We will support Israel in every way that we can,’ Republican presidential candidate Governor Perry told CNN.

‘Whether it's diplomatic, whether it's economic sanctions, whether it's overt or covert operations - up to and including military action.’

Iran ratcheted up Middle East tensions when its foreign minister Ali Akbar Salehi declared the country was ‘ready for war’ with Israel and the West.

Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron are said to be preparing for war after reports Iran is stepping up its nuclear capabilities.

President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s hard-line regime in Tehran has been linked to three assassination plots on foreign soil.

‘We cannot afford to allow that madman in Iran to get his hands on a nuclear weapon - period,’ Governor Perry added.

A U.N. report on Iran’s 
nuclear programme is expected to provide a 'compelling case' that it is secretly building an arsenal of warheads.

Iran plans to complain to the United Nations about alleged U.S. ‘terror’ operations, including assassination of its nuclear scientists.

Nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said the Swiss ambassador to Iran will be summoned to the Foreign Ministry to be handed ‘documents of U.S. terror plots against Iran’.

Copies will be presented by Iran's U.N. envoy to the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in New York later on Friday, Mr Jalili said.

‘The U.S. is employing terrorism to promote its objectives - we will sue the United States,’ he said.

‘The U.N. needs to take the necessary measures to prosecute and punish the U.S. government for directing terrorist activities (against Iran).’

As speculation mounts that Israel or the U.S. could lead a military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities, the U.N. report made clear it does not believe Tehran’s claims that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only.

The report by the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency - to be published next week - will stop short of explicitly saying that Iran is making its own N-bombs.

But in the technical annex it will give plenty of new details and also add to areas of concern it has briefly mentioned previously.

Iran insists its program is for generating electricity.

Meanwhile, Governor Perry's campaign has been slipping after swiftly rising to the top of opinion polls when he entered the race for the president in August.

In a wide-ranging interview with CNN, Governor Perry defended his moderate stance on illegal immigration, including an in-state tuition program.

‘I put that in the category of being very wise economically,’ he said. ‘I mean, when you judge are you going to have taxpayers or tax wasters?’

Illegal immigration is a hot-button issue in the GOP. Governor Perry, who was campaigning in Johnston, Iowa, downplayed his slide in the polls.

‘I know how to run an election, I know how to take the message to the people and that's what we going to keep doing,’ Governor Perry said.

‘So, we will stay focused, we will stay on message, and the end of the day, it will all turn out just right.’

February, 2009: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei said Iran was not allowing U.N. inspectors to determine if it was working developing nuclear weapons.

June, 2009:
IAEA reveals it was blocked from inspecting nuclear facilities, but Mr 
ElBaradei voices opposition to Israel support for military strike, 
saying it would turn region into 'ball of fire'.

Concerns: The Bushehr nuclear plant

July, 2009: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had agreed with President Barack Obama to engage with Iran until the end of the year, but the country would be free to take on the 'existential threat' with military force after the deadline passed. Mr Obama also gave Iran until September to adhere to IAEA proposals or 'face consequences'. Iran threatens to strike back at Israel if its nuclear facilities were targeted.

September, 2009: Second enrichment facility is revealed 20 miles north of Qom, Iran.

January, 2010: Masoul Ali Mohammadi - a particle physicist - is killed by a remote-control bomb as he left for work.

August, 2010: Iran acquires nuclear fuel rods from Russia and begins fuelling of Bushehr I reactor - reportedly to generate electricity.

October, 2010: Stuxnet computer worm infects systems at Natanz enrichment plant, causing centrifuges to crash and suspending work.

November, 2010: Second physicist, Majid Shahriar, killed when bomb was stuck to the side of his car by a motorcyclist.

July, 2011: Darioush Rezaie - third physicist involved in Iran's nuclear programme - shot dead.
