Former Victoria's Secret Angel Miranda Kerr might be blessed with supermodel looks but over half of British women don't believe her claim that she takes 15 minutes to get ready and leave the house in the morning.  

The busy mum of one (son Flynn is three years old), who also runs her own company, wrote recently in her blog: 'I usually have very little time in the mornings, especially with a toddler, so with these simple skin and beauty steps I can get out the door in 15 minutes.'

Kerr's daily regime starts with a glass of warm water with the juice of half an organic lemon followed by dry body brushing, which she describes as an 'integral'.

No way!: Most women don't believe that Miranda Kerr, 31,  takes 15 minutes to go from bedhead to glamazon 

In a survey carried out by Escentual.com, a quarter of women said it would take them 15 minutes to have a shower, let alone put on a full face of make-up, which for Miranda Kerr involves applying tinted day cream, concealer, three coats of mascara and lip balm.

The supermodel does seem to have something in common with the average woman, saying that she multi-tasks in the shower by cleansing her face and body with  Kora Organics Foaming Cleanser and Essential Body Wash, part of her own line of organic beauty products.

A third of the women who responded to the survey said that they would finish applying their make-up on their commute to work if they were in a rush.

Out of 1,000 women who took part in the research most said that Kerr's routine would take them at least 40 minutes from start to finish and nearly half don't believe that supermodels need less time to get ready.

A third of respondents said they would never leave the house after just a quarter of an hour of preparation, however busy they were. 

Fresh: The supermodel's day time look is always immaculate as she freshens up during the day using a mist

Escentual Beauty Editor Emma Leslie said: 'We found that most women would like to have around 45 minutes to get ready for the day so that they felt confident to face the world.

'But it’s fair to say that supermodels like Miranda Kerr may not need quite as much time to look beautiful.'

Kerr did admit to freshening up throughout the day, carrying a mist in her handbag to keep her skin hydrated and always looks immaculate so perhaps she wasn't stretching the truth after all.
