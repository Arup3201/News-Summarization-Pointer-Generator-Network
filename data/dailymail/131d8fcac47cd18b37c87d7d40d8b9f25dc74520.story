The woman accused of abandoning her Down syndrome son has hit back at her husband's claims and said she had to make a 'ruthless decision' in the best interests of the child.

Ruzan Badalyn gave birth to baby Leo on January 21 in an Armenian hospital but within hours, she had allegedly filed for divorce from her husband Sam Forrest after he refused to give up on their child.

She became a hate-figure around the world after Sam claimed his wife of eighteen months handed him an ultimatum: her, or his newborn son. 

But an angry Ruzan has now disputed his version of events and said the couple had agreed that baby Leo would have a better quality of life if he was raised in his father's native New Zealand.

Statement: Ruzan posted her version of events on Facebook, where she wrote the day her son was born was 'the happiest day for me'

Ruzan, who confirmed that she has filed for divorce, released a statement of her version of events on Facebook.

It read: '21 January was the happiest day for me, as I finally gave birth to my long-awaited son. Our son was born at 6.30 in the morning and I remember alarmed faces around and doctors worried looks. I woke hours after anaesthesia. 

'My first question was about the whereabouts of my child. I remember the sad faces of my relatives and the doctors and the diagnosis that sounded like a verdict: ''Your child was born with a Down Syndrome.'' One can never imagine my feelings at that moment

'Hardly had I recovered from the first shock, when the doctor approached me and told me to voice my decision whether I was going to keep Leo or not. I had to make the most ruthless decision in my life within several hours. 

'The first thing that came to my mind after the diagnosis was that I don't want my child to live in a country where certain stereotypes dominate the lives of people with DS and no opportunities at all. I want him to be involved and well-received in society, an integration that will require years and years for our society to adjust to. 

'I saw the evasive looks of the doctors, my relatives' tear-stained faces, received calls of condolences and realised that only a move to a country with such standards as New Zealand would entitle my son to a decent life.

'This fact was not disputed by my spouse either, who occasionally claims in his articles that the baby can't afford the life he deserves in Armenia. Thus, I spent the hours after Leo's birth trying to collect my will and decide on the best destiny for the kid. 

'Everyone in our family realised that the baby's interests should be placed first and only his move to another country could remedy the situation, something that Sam himself also accepted. 

'I understood that in Armenia, where is no extensive social infrastructure to help children with developmental disabilities, no governmental support, with the continuous hard economic situation in the country, with the possibility of renewed war with our hostile neighbour--with whom the fragile cease-fire seems to be deteriorating over time--always looming in the background, with my salary of 180$ being partly supported by my sister and living in my mother’s place and having no other income, as my husband did not work, I would not be able to raise my child with special needs. 

'In Armenia every child is loved and respected and family is a high value, but in this country children with special needs do require special attention, huge financial resources and dedication. 

'In the hardest moment of my life when my husband should be next to me and support and help to take the right decision, I could not find any support from his side. 

'After that incident, he left the hospital notifying me hours later that he was taking the kid with him, that he is going to leave the country for New Zealand and I do not have anything to do with the situation. 

'Without giving me any option and trying to find with me any solution in this hardest situation, he started to circulate the story on every possible platform without even trying to give me a voice accusing that I put him an ultimatum marriage or the baby, which is absolutely not true.

'I tried several times to communicate but he never tried to listen me and to find common solutions. The only response was the accusation from his part. Sam has never suggested joining him and bringing up the child together in his country. 

'Neither did he tell me anything on the day we filed for divorce. The only thing he kept saying was that he didn't want us to separate, whereas my question what we should do always remained unanswered. 

'As a mother who has faced this severe situation, being in the hospital under stress and depression, experiencing enormous pressure from every side, not finding any support from my husband’s part on any possibilities of giving a child decent life in Armenia, I faced two options: to take care of the child on my own in Armenia, or to abandon my maternal instincts and extend the baby an opportunity to enjoy a decent life with his father in New Zealand. I went for the second option.'

In a further twist today, Sam has now said he forgives his wife and that he understands the pressure that exists in Ruzan's home country.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said: 'I don't hold anything against Ruzan. I wanted this personal responsibility and I've assumed it for Leo and she's also made her own decisions.

'I am fully sympathetic about the societal pressures and issues with the culture. There are many factors that come into play.'

He also said that he still believes the couple have a future together and added: 'I adore her and I want to carry through those memories for Leo. I want him to know how good his mum was. I'll hold out the possibility in the future that there will be the possibility of a connection.

'The door will always be open. For that to happen she will need to fully accept Leo and take on her responsibilities as a mother.'  

Sam, who runs an online business in Armenia's capital Yerevan, claimed that Ruzan and her family were ashamed of Leo's condition and had decided to abandon the child without consulting him first. 

But Ruzan hit back at those claims and said: 'I tried several times to communicate but he never tried to listen me and to find common solutions. The only response was the accusation from his part.

Flee: Sam has now raised more than $440,000 via his crowdfunding page as he seeks to bring Leo back to his native New Zealand

'Sam has never suggested joining him and bringing up the child together in his country. Neither did he tell me anything on the day we filed for divorce.'

Sam claimed his wife refused to look at or even touch her son because Armenian culture believes a child with a condition like Leo's brings shame on the entire family.

When Leo was born, Samuel said he wasn't immediately allowed to see his son or wife.

He said: 'This paediatrician walks out of the room with a little bundle... She had his face covered up and hospital authorities wouldn't let me see him or my wife.

'When the doctor came out, he said 'there's a real problem with your son'.'

Samuel said he was shocked when doctors initially told him of Leo's Down syndrome, but it never crossed his mind to abandon him.

He added: 'They took me in to see him and I looked at this guy and I said, he's beautiful, he's perfect and I'm absolutely keeping him.'

The first-time father set up a webpage to crowd fund as he tries to flee the eastern European country so he can raise Leo back in his native New Zealand.

The fundraising page, titled Bring Leo Home, has already raised more than $440,000, leaving Sam stunned by the outpouring of support.
