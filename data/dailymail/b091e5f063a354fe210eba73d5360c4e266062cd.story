A mystery graffiti artist has been making 'No Entry' signs a little more accessible - by adding their own flourishes to the plain red and white design.

In St Austell, Cornwall, and in London, the silhouette of a man has been painted on in a series of comedy poses - and brightening up the view for passers-by.

In one picture, the man has his hands and head put through holes in the white bar, as if he were in the stocks.

In another, the man cuts the white bar in half with a saw like a carpenter sawing a plank of wood.

A third shows the silhouette of a man carrying the bar under his arm as he walks along the roundel of the sign.

And yet another example takes a romantic turn, as the stick man hugs the white bar - complete with little red hearts to match the red background.

No one has any idea as to the identity of the artist, or why he might have made the additions to the signs.

The artist known as Banksy is the best-known 'underground' graffiti artist, whose works can be found in London, Bristol and across the world - and like the 'No Entry' artist, his real identity is still unconfirmed.

Many stealth graffiti artists often take their inspiration from 'Blek le Rat' - real name Xavier Prou - who began stenciling images including rats and ballerinas on the walls of Paris in the 1980s, and who is credited as being one of the first graffiti artists to be recognised as more than simply a vandal.

Graffiti 'art' is still a subject of controversy.

In 2009, a Banksy work parodying the Royal Family was partially removed from a wall in Hackney, east London, after the council served an enforcement notice for graffiti removal to the property owner.

But there have as yet been no suggestions that these new installations will be removed.

And while the stop signs are nowhere near as widespread or as highly regarded as Banksy and le Rat's creations, passers-by who have spotted them admit they have given them a reason to smile.

One
Cornish local said: 'It's highly amusing. Those sort of signs are 
things you see dozens of times a day, and, to be honest, they're pretty 
boring to look at.'

The silhouette signs have received rave reviews on Twitter.

Shaun Byrne wrote: 'Best sign art ever.'

Robert Wallace tweeted: 'Very cool designer - No-Entry sign in St Agnes.'
