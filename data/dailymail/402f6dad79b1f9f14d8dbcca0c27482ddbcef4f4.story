With scenes of snow-covered mountains and plenty of alone time for couples, these retro posters that glamorise the golden days of Europe’s top ski resorts are being snapped up by collectors.

The exclusive set features popular resorts, including Chamonix in France and St Moritz in Switzerland, and colourful portrayals of thrills on the slopes or relaxing times at the lodge.

Created with an art deco style, the posters may look like they were created in the 1930s, but each one is a new design that harks back to the times when ski resorts were a playground for the affluent, and the lower classes made do with trips to the UK seaside.

Printed on fine art cotton paper the prints are limited to runs of only 280 each, making them as exclusive as the resorts they portray

The creations have been brought up to date by featuring a range of modern skiing destinations, including Val d’Isere in France and St Anton in Austria.

Printed on fine art cotton paper the prints are limited to runs of only 280 each, making them as exclusive as the resorts they portray.

But at £395 each, the 3ft by 2ft posters cost a fraction of the tens of thousands of pounds that original vintage ones sell for.

They are the brainchild of vintage poster dealer Simon Khachadourian, who runs a gallery in Chelsea, London.

Simon commissioned artist Charles Avalon to reinvigorate the posters of old by creating a new set in the same art deco style.

The result is the collection of 34 winter sports posters which can be bought from Pullman Limited Editions.

Georgina Khachadourian, from Pullman Limited Editions, said: ‘My husband Simon has been dealing in vintage posters for 30 years and during that time he's seen the price of them rocket.

‘They were never made to last and print runs were often very limited so very few have survived and that has driven prices up.

‘Nowadays vintage posters are very collectable and sought after but they can sell for tens of thousands of pounds and that is beyond the means of most people.

‘Realising this we had the idea to commission artists to create a new set of winter sports posters in the same art deco style but at a price that was much more affordable.' 

Created with an art deco style, the adverts may look like they were created in the 1930s, but each one is a new design

Georgina added: ‘We have kept the stylised elements from that era in our posters but also brought them up to date by featuring resorts that are popular now and that perhaps didn't exist in the 1920s and 1930s.

‘The art deco winter sports posters are such an iconic look and we wanted people to be able to bring that style into their homes without breaking the bank.

‘Our posters are very popular and they sell to people all round the world. Often people buy posters of the places they go skiing to each year.’
