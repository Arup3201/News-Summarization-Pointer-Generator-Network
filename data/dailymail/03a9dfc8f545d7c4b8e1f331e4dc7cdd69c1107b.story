Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani may be known for taming crime, but a book probing into his life claims that his father was tied to the mob and served prison time for armed robbery.

Though Giuliani credits his father with raising him to have the values that made him a success, the book alleges that his father had connections with organized crime. 

Rudy!: An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani, written by former Village Voice investigative reporter and senior editor Wayne Barrett in 2001, alleges a slew of claims about the former mayor and his family.

This was a decade before his son, who later sought the 2008 GOP presidential nomination, was born.

Harold Giuliani also allegedly 'broke legs, smashed kneecaps [and] crunched noses' when he served as a 'muscle' for a for a loansharking operation in the 1950s, and got in a Brooklyn gunfight in the 1960s, according to ABC.

Direct links between the former mayor and organized crime, however, are hard to find, Barrett told ABC.

'I think Harold Giuliani went out of his way to protect his son from that environment. Rudy has said he was taught to hate the mob when he was growing up,' Barrett said. 

Giuliani, who was mayor of New York from 1994 through 2001, is credited for taking down organized crime and lowering crime in the city. 

He also is known for his great leadership in New York after the September 11 attacks. 

The former mayor has said that has missed his father every day since he died of prostate cancer in 1981.

'He taught me enormously important lessons, including the lesson of being honest, which I've practiced all my life,' Giuliani said when asked about the book in 2001. 

Barrett's book also reveals information about his romantic relationships with two women that eventually led to a public separation from his wife, Donna Hanover.

Giuliani recently hit headlines after questioning President Barack Obama's love of the United States last week.

The former mayor said at a New York City event on Wednesday night that 'I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America.' 

'He doesn't love you. And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country,' Giuliani said, according to Politico. 

Giuliani says he is standing by his comments about  Obama and denies that the statements are rooted in racism.

But he said he has received death threats - mainly in the form of voicemails - in the wake of the controversial comments. 

'I'm right about this. I have no doubt about it. I do not withdraw my words,' Giuliani told NBC Friday. 'I do not detect, in this man, the same rhetoric and the same language, the same love of America that I detected in other American presidents including democrats.' 

Giuliani told NBC that though he never meant to question the president's patriotism, he absolutely will not apologize for saying what he believes.
