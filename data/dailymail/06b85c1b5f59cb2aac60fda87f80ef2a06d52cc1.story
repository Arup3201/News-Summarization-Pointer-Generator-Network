On trial: Nicole Baukus is facing two charges of vehicular homicide after driving the wrong way up a Texas highway. Her trial began this week

A Texas woman who caused a deadly crash after consuming 21 drinks in four hours and driving the wrong way on a highway was sentenced to 38 years in prison Friday.

In a surprise move Thursday, Nicole Baukus, 23, changed her plea to guilty and was sentenced on two counts of vehicular manslaughter homicide and one count of vehicular assault.

Before entering a guilty plea, Baukus, from Spring, faced up to 60 years in prison.

The wrong-way crash that took place in June 2012 on the North Freeway in Montgomery County left two teenagers dead and a third seriously injured.

During the sentencing hearing Friday afternoon, jurors heard testimony from an emotional Baukus, who sobbed on the stand, saying; 'I don’t deserve to be here. I should have died in that crash also.

‘They did not deserve to die. I did. They were innocent.’

In her testimony, the 23-year-old talked about the her high school boyfriend, who died in 2007 in a DUI crash, telling the jury and members of the audience that she never wanted to put anyone through that. 

She also revealed to the jurors that a few months ago, she wrote a suicide note and planned to kill herself.

Recalling the fateful night of June 29, 2012, Baukus said that she did not remember downing 21 shots before getting behind the wheel of her truck. She had previously claimed that she had been drugged.

Emotional testimony: Baukus tearfully told the jury the unlike her, the victims were innocent and did not deserve to die in the crash

The jury also heard from the defendant's friend, who testified that he had several phone conversations with Baukus on the night of the crash, in the last of which she told him that she was on the side of the road 'throwing up on herself,' MyFox Houston reported. 

Just moments later, at around 3am, Baukus slammed her vehicle head on into another car, killing the driver, 19-year old Nicole Adams, and the backseat passenger, 18-year old Travis Saunders. Front seat passenger David Porras suffered severe injuries but pulled through.

A toxicology test determined that the 23-year-old had a blood alcohol level four times the legal limit.

She also had marijuana and Valium in her system, and police found a glass drug pipe in her car. In his closing arguments, prosecutors Warren Diepraam and Andrew James called Baukus an 'overindulgent party girl' and a sometimes 'drug dealer.'

Fred Saunders, whose son Travis was killed in the drunk driving accident, said he does not believe Baukus was truly remorseful for her actions

"The best thing for this community is to get her out of it.  Keep her out of it as long as possible.  When you do what she did you won't get to go home,’ James told the jury.

The station KAKE reported that Baukus’ father took the stand before the jury began deliberations, talking about his own problems with alcohol and about his daughter, at one point saying, ‘I'm just happy she's alive. She should be dead too and I can't imagine how the victims' families feel.’

Fred Sanders, the father of crash victim Travis Sanders, sat through all the testimony and said he does not believe Baukus was truly remorseful for her actions.

‘I didn't think it was for us. I didn't think it was for our kids, those three innocent kids. That wasn't for them; that was for the jury. It was for her cause she's afraid she's going to jail,’ he told the TV station Click2Houston.

Footage
 from a Texas bar shows a 23-year-old woman consuming 21 drinks before 
she drove home the wrong way down a highway, killing two teenagers in a 
head-on crash.

A court was 
told earlier this week that Baukus drank four bottled beers and 21 
'shooters', or spirit mixers, in about four and a half hours, before 
getting in her pick up truck and causing the fatal crash.

Prosecutors
 at her trial showed video footage of Baukus drinking at the 
On the Rox sports bar and of her pick up truck traveling the wrong way 
down a highway in Conroe, on June 29, last year.

As
 an emergency physician who attended to the two victims in the crash 
testified to their grievous injuries, Baukus broke down in court 
Wednesday -- so much so that a 10 minute recess was called.

District Court Judge Michael T. Seiler then warned her not to repeat the behavior.

'We can’t have that kind of disruption,' he said.

She
 is accused of crashing head on into a car being driven by Nicole Adams,
 killing the 19-year-old and her back seat passenger, Travis Sanders, 
18, according to KHOU News.

A third passenger, 21-year-old David Porras, was seriously injured in the crash, which happened just before 3am.

In
 court Wednesday, prosecutors played emergency calls from other drivers 
as they reported seeing a pick up truck traveling the wrong way.

Deadly: Baukus is accused of slamming headlong into Adams' car, pictured, causing two deaths and critically injuring 21-year-old David Porras

Baukus is charged with two counts of intoxication manslaughter and one count of intoxication assault. She pleaded not guilty on all counts

Trashed: Debris littered the Texas highway around the accused woman's car

Before police could stop Baukus, the 
fatal collision took place. An hour after the crash her blood-level 
alcohol was more than three times the legal limit. Prosecutors also 
claim she had drugs in her system. 

Texas
 Alcoholic Beverage Commission agent Oscar Williams told the court 
Baukus had consumed beer and shooters at On the Rox, from 9:19pm to 
1:46am.

He said that a
 tray of shooters was seen being delivered to her table just after 
midnight, which violated the Texas commission's rules, according to The Courier of Montgomery County.

'Only two open beverages can be sold to one customer at a time,' he said.

In April the bar agreed to a $1million settlement for Mr Porras, who is still having surgery from injuries caused in the crash, and to the estate of Miss Adams and Mr Sanders.

Porras has had 13 operations since the accident and has no teeth in his upper jaw after the bone was smashed when he hit the dashboard.

Put away? If convicted, Baukus would likely have to serve at least half her time before parole is even considered

Emotions high: Baukus broke down as a physician who attended to the two victims testified Wednesday and was admonished by the judge

Serious charges: Baukus' truck following the June 29, 2012 accident. Prosecutors in the case are trying to prove the truck was a deadly weapon, which would make her ineligible for parole until at least half her sentence is served

Survivor: The surviving passenger of Nicole Adams' car, David Porras, now has no teeth in his upper jaw and has undergone 13 operations since the crash

Baukus' trial is expected to last five days. She faces decades behind bars if convicted

Wasted: An hour after the crash that left two dead and one grievously injured, Baukaus' blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit

The bar was sued for violating the 
Texas Dram Shop Liability Act, which provides a cause of action against 
any bar that serves an obviously intoxicated adult, the Villager reported.

At
 her vehicular manslaughter trial, prosecutor Andrew James told the 
court: 'As the trooper was questioning her, he noticed she would just 
randomly be laughing at times, like this was all one big joke.'
