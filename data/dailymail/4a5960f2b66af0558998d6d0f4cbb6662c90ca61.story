Confessed: Eldon G. Samuel III said that his father abused him and shoved him twice while holding a gun on the night before Eldon shot him four times

A 14-year-old Idaho boy accused of murdering his father and brother cited the stress of having a disabled child in the household when asked to explain his actions.

Eldon Gale Samuel III's 13-year-old brother, Jonathan Samuel, had autism, which Eldon told authorities caused his father, 46-year-old Eldon Samuel Jr., to develop an addiction to painkillers, and for his mother to leave the family.

'Eldon, when asked why he did what he did, said "If [his brother] wasn’t there … 
we’d be a happy family,’” Magistrate Judge Barry Watson told reporters on Friday.

Previously, Eldon told investigators that he thought it was cool how the character in the violent video game Grand Theft Auto relieves his stress by shooting people. He has been charged as an adult in the March 24 murders.

Eldon described 'hating Jonathan for about five years,' the Spokesman-Review reports. He told authorities that he loved his father, but that he acted crazy when he was under the influence of drugs.

'He just beat me. I loved him, but the next time he came after me …,' Samuel told police officers in a report quoted by Watson. 'That’s self-defense, right?'

Samuel initially was charged with first-degree murder in both deaths.

However,
 Watson said he was changing the charge to second-degree murder in the 
father's death after the younger Samuel said his father abused him.

The judge says there's a stronger case for premeditation in the brother's death.

He 
allegedly shot his father four times with a pistol before using a 
shotgun to shoot his younger brother once before attacking him with a 
knife and machete. 

Eldon
 said that his father had been taking unspecified medication and talking
 about zombies the night of the murder, and that he he went outside and 
fired a .45 caliber pistol into the air.

When
 the boys' father went back in the house, he got into an argument with 
Eldon and the boy said that his dad shoved him twice in the chest.

At that point, Eldon says he took the gun and shot his father in the stomach.

His father did not die immediately following that shot, and was reportedly crawling to his other son's room.

Eldom
 told police that he feared his father was 'coming after him,' which is 
what prompted him to fire three additional rounds, two in the cheek and a 
final time in his temple.

He then reportedly switched firearms and got a shotgun to shoot his brother who was hiding under his bed.

Eldon then stabbed his brother Jonathan with both a machete and knife.

'Eldon physically demonstrated the manner in which he held and used the machete,' the investigators wrote in their report.

'The demonstration showed a violent and ‘severe’ action used on his brother.'

Eldon's
 father's drug use has been well documented, and it appears that his 
eldest son was often the one who had to take care of him when he would 
take too much.

In August, 
police were called to the Kooteni Hospital, where Eldon's father was 
unconscious, after hospital staff became worried about Eldon and his 
brother. Police noted at the time that Eldon was calm and didn't seem 
shocked that his father was unconscious and in the hospital.

Police also noticed that Eldon seemed to be used to taking care of his little brother - but was frustrated.

Just
 four days later, police were summoned to the Samuels' home, where the 
boys' father was found slumped over, inebriated and incoherent in the 
front yard. Eldon had called police because he was worried his father 
would try to drive. His brother was found hiding under the bed.

The
 night of the murders, neighbors reported hearing a single gunshot about
 7:30 p.m., which seems to corroborate Eldon's story about his father 
firing the gun outside of the home.

After punching and pushing him, Eldon says his father dropped his .45-caliber pistol, but that he often carried another gun.

'I felt scared, like he was going to kill me. I didn’t know if he had the 9 mm on him,' Samuel told the officers.

That's when Eldon picked up the gun and shot his father in the chest.

The boy's trial is scheduled to resume this week.
