Horrific: College student Sasha Marsden died as a result of 'significant stab wounds', a post-mortem examination has revealed

A 16-year-old girl was fatally stabbed in the head and face before she was set on fire in an alleyway, it emerged today.

College student Sasha Marsden, from Blackpool, Lancashire, died as a result of 'significant stab wounds', a post-mortem examination has revealed.

The teenager was found in the South Shore area of the resort at about 9pm on Thursday.

Lancashire Constabulary said it has been given more time to question a 22-year-old man held on suspicion of her murder.

A 20-year-old woman who was arrested at the same time on Thursday night has been released without charge.

The body of a teenager was found burning in a back alley.

Hoteliers tried to put out the flames which had engulfed the remains by throwing bowls of water on her.

At first they thought they were dousing a mannequin but then realised it was a human body when they saw blood stains.

A police spokesman said: ‘Following the death of Sasha Marsden, a Home Office post-mortem examination has been carried out and has found that Sasha died as a result of receiving significant stab wounds to the head and face.

‘It also showed that attempts were made to set the body on fire and this was after Sasha had died.

‘The results have been shared with the family, and specially trained officers are continuing to support them.

‘Detectives have been granted a warrant of further detention in respect of a 22-year-old man and he will be detained at Blackpool police station for a further 36 hours.

‘The 20-year-old woman who was arrested has been released without charge.’

Tragic: A post-mortem examination has shown that Sasha Marsden, pictured, a college student from Blackpool, died as a result of 'significant stab wounds

Sasha lived in the Staining area of Blackpool with her parents and was in the first year of a childcare course at Blackpool and the Fylde College.

Detectives
launched a murder investigation and arrested a man and a woman close to
the scene in Kirby Road shortly after the discovery.

Forensic
officers have been examining crime scenes in the alleyway and also 
rooms inside the Grafton House Hotel in Blackpool, Lancashire, where the
arrested couple were believed to be staying.

The
tragedy occurred just four months after Sasha, who lives in the seaside 
resort, went missing for six days in September, sparking a frantic search
by her family across the UK.

She was eventually found a week later 300 miles away Lowestoft, Suffolk - although it was not known why she went missing.

Tragedy: Schoolgirl Sasha lived in the Staining area of Blackpool with her parents and was a keen dancer

Sasha was a keen dancer who worked in
a children's nursery at Blackpool Victoria Hospital.

She was living with her parents Gary,
42, and Jayne, 45, in the Staining area of the town.

Carl Evans, 35, owner of the Kimber 
House Hotel who found the body at about 9.15pm last night said: 'The first thing I knew something 
was wrong was when the fire or smoke alarm went off next door.

'The
alarm was raised a short time later when one of our other neighbours 
was out walking his dog and came across what turned out to be a burning 
body.

A Facebook tribute page had already been inundated with horrified friends and family rushing to leave their condolences.

One
girl, called Laura Fairclough, wrote: 'don't even no (sic) what to say I
love you loads and you was always there when I needed a chat :), I 
cannot stop thinking of you and can't get a pic of you in my mind.

'You
was such an amazing friend that nobody could ask for and we had known 
each other ages. R.I.P to the best beautiful friend you can be.'

Another heartbroken friend, called 
Emmaa Borsay, posted: 'I love you so much, it wasn't so long ago I 
remember you mailing me on facebook asking to meet up in blackpool 
again, you shouldn't have been taken, you were one of the good ones!

'You'll be forever loved and missed, always in my heart im (sic) glad I was a part of your life xxxxx'

One
friend, Jess Procter, said: 'Carnt (sic) believe this!:'( I'm 
heartbroke, you babe are one of the most AMAZING people I know and 
babygirl you ment loads to me and still do, spread your wings and fly.'

Katrina Jasmine Morgan who wrote: 'Your gonna be 
missed by so many people Sasha and you certainly wont be forgotten. You 
were harmless how anyone could take your life away so cruely is beyond 
me, i'll miss are random conversations and your banter. Sleep tight and 
dream with the angels gorgeous xxxxx'

Detective Superintendent Andy Murphy said a large police team was working on the case

In a tribute to her, Mandy Pritchard, head of the college's school for society, health and childhood, said she was 'a friendly, considerate individual who cared about her fellow students'.

Crime scene investigators are carrying out forensic searches of the alley and at an address in Kirby Road, which is a few blocks off the Promenade.

Officers are checking local CCTV cameras and carrying out house-to-house inquiries.

Senior investigating officer Detective Superintendent Andy Murphy said: 'This is a murder inquiry and we are dealing with the suspicious death of a 16-year-old girl.

'I would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time last night to come forward and contact the police.

'We have a large team of highly trained police officers working on this investigation and we are determined to find out exactly what happened.

'It is difficult to imagine what the girl's family are going through and we have specially trained family liaison officers working with them to offer them support.

'We will be keeping them informed of the progress of our investigation.'

Police are particularly keen for anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the Kirby Road area between 4pm and 9.15pm yesterday to come forward.

Supt Eddie Newton said: 'Incidents like this do send a sense a shock throughout our communities and I would like to reassure the public that we have a team of dedicated and highly trained officers working on this investigation to try and establish exactly what has happened.

'I would ask people not to worry; we believe that this is an isolated incident and that there is no risk to the public. We have two people in custody helping with the investigation and detectives are following a number of different lines of enquiry.

'Our neighbourhood policing teams are out in the area and I would urge anyone who has any concerns to approach one of our officers and speak to them. They are there to offer you support and allay any fears that you may have.

'We have specially trained family liaison officers working closely with the family offering them support and our thoughts are with them at this sad time.'

In a website for jobseekers Sasha submitted her CV and said: 'I am a hard working and honest person, I love a challenge and can apply myself to a range of jobs.

'I have a strong sense of responsibility and I'm happy to work on my own or with a team. I consider myself to be very organised and punctual and to be very good with customers and the public.'
