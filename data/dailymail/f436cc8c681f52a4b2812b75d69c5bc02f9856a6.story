Militants in Egypt claim to have beheaded four men they had accused of being Israeli Mossad spies in a video which appears to have been inspired by the tactics of the Islamic State. 

Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which has been described as Egypt's most dangerous militant group,  released the video, in which it accused the four Egyptians of spying for Israel's Mossad agency.

In the video, the captives can be seen kneeling on the floor with armed men in black masks standing behind them as one of the militants reads out a statement. Minutes later the four men have been beheaded.

Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which has been described as Egypt's most dangerous militant group, has released a shocking new video in which four men, accused of being Israeli Mossad spies, are beheaded

Security sources have said four headless corpses were found in the Sinai Peninsula earlier this month

Security sources said four headless corpses were found in the Sinai Peninsula earlier this month - the first time any decapitations had been made public in Egypt.

The men had reportedly been abducted by gunmen two days earlier while driving in the town of Sheikh Zuwaid, which is just a few miles from the Gaza Strip.

The filmed killings are reminiscent of images posted online by militant group Islamic State, which has seized parts of Iraq and Syria.

This has led to suggestions that Sinai-based Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis might have been inspired by the group, notorious for beheadings and executions.

The Sinai militants are not believed to be officially linked to Islamic State insurgents. 

However, Egyptian intelligence officials say the group has influenced Egyptian militants who are based just over the border with Libya, Reuters has reported.

The officials say the Libya-based fighters have also established contacts with Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis.

In the video, militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis presented what it said were confessions by the men

Two of the men said they had spent time in Israeli jails for smuggling. The other two said Mossad had paid them for information

The group said the men provided intelligence used in an airstrike on July 23 in northern Sinai that killed three of its fighters

Militants in the Sinai have stepped up attacks on policemen and soldiers since then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi toppled President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in July 2013 

Though the four dead men were civilians, security sources had said initially that they might have been targeted for their perceived allegiance to the police and army.

The attacks initially targeted security forces in Sinai - a remote but strategic part of Egypt located between Israel, the Gaza Strip and the Suez Canal - but they have since extended their reach, with bombings on the mainland. 

It was reported today that Islamic State had released a new decapitation video, threatening America for the second time and urging the Kurds to break from their alliance with the West against the caliphate.

Just hours after Islamic State released shocking footage of the mass execution of 300 Syrian national army soldiers in the Syrian desert, the group issued a second warning to the United States.

The grainy video, accompanied by the hashtag '2ndAmessagetoAmerica', shows the vicious beheading of a Kurdish soldier, who was part of a group of 15 fighters likely to have been captured by Islamic State during the fighting in Iraq.

The group's first warning ten days ago was entitled 'A Message to America' and showed the decapitation of American journalist James Foley.

In the latest video, the captors first issue a warning they will continue to decapitate prisoners should America continue to support the Kurds in their fight against the Islamic State.

They then behead one of the captives on a sandy roadside in Iraq, where the Great Mosque of Mosul can be seen in the background.
