Many employers use Google to 'screen' potential employees - and look at Facebook profiles - but one American job application appears to show the company demanding passwords to get access to private messages on Facebook and Myspace

Could employers demand your Facebook password as part of a job application?

One American was shocked to find a section in an application form that demanded not only his user names - but also passwords that would give his employers full access to his account, including private messages to other people.

Employers using Google - or 'people search' engines such as 123People - has become a standard part of job applications, and employers also check Facebook.

But asking for passwords that allow access to private communications is a worrying new precedent. In a recent YouGov survey, 42 per cent of British students admitted that they worried that posts on 'social' sites could harm their chances with potential employers.At least 20 per cent and reportedly up to half of employers check Facebook accounts as part of the application process.The launch of Google's rival Plus network was largely sold on the ability to 'control' which information was visible - but if employers were able to demand passwords, then even this protection would be invalid. A recent survey by Telstra revealed that 20 per cent of bosses also check employees' Facebook accounts while at the company.One picture, purportedly of a job application for a clerical position with the police in North Carolina, shows a demand for passwords for 'accounts such as Facebook, Myspace, etc'.

The application - purportedly for a clerical position with Maryland police - asks for passwords which would allow access to private messages, pictures and even friends' private details

Tecca, the blog which found the job application, commented, 'Would you agree to a full search of your home and worldly possessions in order to land a job? If the answer is no, then you should be just as hesitant to let someone rummage around inside your online identity.'Various online agencies now offer to 'clean' people's online profiles specifically for job applications, and young job applicants often use pseudonyms on Facebook to prevent employers 'snooping'.

After a recent scandal about Australian bosses rejecting applicants because of Facebook posts, Mark Bowles, Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief economist said, 'We're starting to see a trend towards people setting up two Facebook accounts so they can still have an account to share photos with friends and when it comes to befriending workmates and bosses they have a separate account, which they can keep a bit more sterile.'

Be careful: What you post online may come back to haunt you later in life

Christopher Graham, the information 
commissioner, said: 'In tough times, young people are clearly less 
relaxed about privacy, particularly in relation to information that they
post online - but many may not know what they can do about it.'

This
survey comes after Acas, the arbitration service, published a new guide
urging employers not to be 'heavy-handed' by penalising staff for 
unprofessional comments left on websites.

Employers were warned of the risks of 'Googling' potential recruits and using any personal information from the internet.

John
Taylor, Acas’s chief executive, has advised bosses to be wary about 
disciplining employees for comments made on social networking websites.

Students are also not taking the threat of identity fraud seriously enough

He said: They need to consider the 
potential impact of any negative publicity. Heavy-handed monitoring can 
cause bad feeling and be time consuming.

'A
manager wouldn't follow an employee down the pub to check on what he or
she said to friends about their day at work. Just because they can do 
something like this online, doesn't mean they should.'

But
at the same time employees need to be cautious about what they post 
online. 'Online conduct should not differ from offline conduct,' he 
said.

Employees should 
assume everything said on the internet is public, and should consider 
whether they want their colleagues or boss to read it. He said: 'They 
might not mean it, but what they post could end up being seen by 
billions of people worldwide.'

The
ICO study has been released to coincide with the launch of its new 
‘Student Brand Ambassador’ campaign - a nationwide project aimed at 
raising young people’s awareness of information rights.
