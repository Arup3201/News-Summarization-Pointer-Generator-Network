The parents of a six-year-old boy who was beaten and starved to death after being placed back into their care were found guilty of murder on Tuesday and sentenced to 30-60 years in prison.

The Philadelphia couple, who kept their son, Khalil Wimes, locked in an empty room with only a urine soaked mattress, had beaten the boy right up to the day before he died.

Wimes died in March last year weighing just 28 pounds - the average weight of a two-year-old - and doctors found scars, bruises and cuts all over his frail body.

Tortured: The six-year-old boy was beaten and starved to death by his parents

Guilty: Floyd and Tina Wimes were found guilty on Tuesday of murdering their son, 6, who weighed just 28 pounds when he died - 
the average weight of a two-year-old

He died from a blunt force to the head after which police arrested his parents, Tina Wimes, 44, and Floyd Wimes, 48, from South Philadelphia.

The abuses suffered by the six-year-old victim were described by both the judge and the prosecutor as the worst case they have ever seen, according to CBS.

The victim’s grandmother suggested the parents be forced to look at their son’s picture in their prison cells.

Punishment: The Philadelphia prosecutor suggests the two parents should be forced to wear their child's pictures: one of him looking healthy, before they took custody at age three, and another of the boy on the coroner’s table

Philadelphia prosecutor Edward McCann said the two should instead have to wear his pictures: one of a healthy-looking Khalil before they took custody at age three, and another, the boy on the coroner’s table.

‘Everyone should know what they did over the course of, as the judge aptly said, three years, where this child really was tortured, physically tortured — deprived of food, deprived of company, kept in a cage essentially, locked away from people who loved him,’ McCann said.

Police searching the couple’s 
home at the time of his death found that Khalil’s bedroom door had a latch which let it be locked
from the outside and reported that the room was empty except for a 
urine stained mattress on the floor.

Victim: Six-year-old Khalil Wimes was beaten and starved to death by his parents after being returned to their care

Khalil’s
‘devastated’ family, who looked after Khalil until he was two, are blaming the DHS for releasing the boy back into his parents care despite
their history of violence and drug abuse.

City
officials are now trying to find out why Khalil and his 3-year-old 
sister, Maya, were living with their mother after Family Court judges 
had terminated her right to the couple's five other children.

Two of the children were in foster care and three had been placed in the care of relatives.

However
Khalil was put back into the care of his parents after his foster 
mother Alicia Nixon lost a custody battle to adopt him, according to 
sources.

‘I'm devastated; my whole family is devastated. Anybody who knew us and knew him are devastated,’ Alicia Nixon told Action News.

According to police, Tina and Floyd Wimes
drove Khalil to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia at 10.45pm 
Monday but he was pronounced dead at 11.16pm.

His parents claimed that Khalil had fallen over in the bathroom and had seemed fine but then passed out.

Doctors reported that they found both new and 
old injuries all over Khalil's body and the cause of his death was 
determined to be multiple blunt force trauma and malnutrition.

Investigators say Khalil's scars are consistent with regular beatings with belts and cords.

'Angel': Tina Wimes posted this picture on her Facebook describing Khalil as 'my angel sent on Valentine's Day'

It appeared that the boy had been 
starved by his parents, he weighed 28 pounds and a boy his age should 
typically weigh at least double that amount.

'He
suffered from malnutrition because nobody's feeding him,' said Police 
Commissioner Charles Ramsey. 'I mean like any six-year-old child, you're
depending upon your parents to take care of you. Or some other adult.'

Neighbours
were shocked to discover that the couple, who both have drug problems, 
had a son living with them as they never saw the six-year-old.

Different story: This photo shows a seemingly happy family but Khalil was previously taken out of his parents' care because of their violent history

His parents had a history of 
violence and drug abuse dating back to before Khalil was born and Khalil
was put into the care of his cousin Alicia Nixon when he was 
one-week-old.

Nixon 
was denied permanent custody of Khalil and he was given back to his 
parents but he then returned to Nixon just four days later after his 
parents could not look after him.

But
when Khalil was two his parents applied to have their son returned to 
them and, satisfied that they were off drugs and that Floyd Wimes had a 
job, the court allowed the boy back into their care.

Nixon said that she raised Khalil 
for three years ‘constantly loving him and making sure he was ok’  and 
that ‘his parents fought us tooth and nail until they got him back and 
then they killed him.’

Murdered: Khalil's former foster mother is blaming the DHS for allowing Khalil to be returned to his abusive parents

House of horror: Khalil's family say his parents lived in 'squalor' and neighbours were shocked that the boy lived at the apartment as they never saw him

'They gave him back to the very
people who hurt him, and now we're getting him back dead,' Nixon told 
Philly.com. 'We're sick and broken and there's nothing anyone could do 
or say that could give us comfort right now, except the fact that Khalil
is no longer suffering at the hands of those monsters.'

The family argue that they pleaded with the DHS and the court system to protect the young boy and his sister from their parents - writing letters of appeal to the mayor, DHS, and the judge, begging for the decision to be overturned.

‘DHS
is supposed to protect the children. He was in a very safe home; he was
ripped from a safe home and taken back to squalor. I'm very saddened 
but I'll be honest with you, I'm extremely angry, I'm angry right now,’ 
uncle Sulaiman Hadi said.

It's unclear why Khalil and his 
3-year-old sister were still living at the home and DHS have not made 
comment on the case. It is believed that the DHS had no open cases on 
Khalil and his sister.

On
Tina Wimes Facebook she lists the births of all her children and 
beneath a picture taken of Khalil she writes: 'My angel sent on 
Valentine's Day' - referencing his February 14 birthday.
