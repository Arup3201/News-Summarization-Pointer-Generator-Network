To protect and serve: Deputy Constable Kenneth Caplan (pictured right) has been charged with aggravated assault for allegedly shooting a driver in the head for honking at him  

A Texas deputy has been arrested and charged with aggravated assault for allegedly shooting a woman in the head in what police are calling a road-rage incident.

The confrontation took place during the evening rush hour on November 11 on the 610 South Loop near Stella Link in Houston.

The victim, a 20-year-old woman, told investigators she was heading west in the right lane when she was cut off by a small blue car.

The motorist honked her horn and continued on her way, but a short time later the other driver, identified as Precinct 6 Deputy Constable Kenneth Caplan, caught up with her, rolled down his window, pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger, reported Click2Houston. 

According to police, a woman in Caplan’s passenger seat leaned back when he shot at the female driver. The couple then fled the scene.

Luckily for the 20-year-old, the bullet only grazed the left side of her head. She was able to pull over on the side of the road and call 911.

Paramedics who responded to the call transported the driver to Memorial Hermann Hospital with non life-threatening injuries.

A two-week investigation into the shooting resulted in the arrest of Deputy Caplan Wednesday.

According to the officer's LinkedIn account, he was hired by the Harris County Constable’s Office - Precinct 6 in July 2012.

Brush with death:The 20-year-old victim was driving on the freeway earlier this month when a blue car tried to cut her off and she honked her horn. The car caught up with her later, and that's when she was shot at by the driver of that vehicle, reportedly Deputy Constable Caplan. A view of the scene above

Painful: The victim, who wished not to be identified, luckily survived the incident since the bullet only grazed the side of her head. She was rushed to the hospital where the laceration on her head was sewn up with eight staple stitches

Unacceptable: Caplan was arrested this week in connection to the shooting. His police precinct issued a statement saying they do not condone or tolerate the actions. Above, emergency responders treat the victim on a gurney

'I serve and protect my community by enforcing the law,' he wrote on his page.

The precinct has released a statement pointing out that Caplan was off duty and was dressed as a civilian at the time of the incident.

'The Harris County Constable's Office - Precinct 6 neither condones nor tolerates the actions taken by Kenneth Caplan that connected him to this incident, and the necessary measures were taken to collect his credentials and remove him from our status,' the statement read.

The passenger in the officer's car was questioned by police but not charged in the shooting.

Speaking to KHOU Wednesday, the victim said that she is afraid of retaliation.

‘I keep thinking someone is going to come up and shoot me,’ she said.

The woman recalled how she heard ringing in her ears when the shot was fired at her head, and how she kept thinking that she was going to bleed to death in her car.

‘I feel like I got a taste of death, honestly,’ she said.
