Britain’s Davis Cup captain Leon Smith has dismissed any suggestion that some of his team’s support for a Yes vote in the Scottish referendum will dilute their commitment to the GB cause next year.

America will be the opposition for March’s first round, which will take place in Glasgow’s Emirates Arena, with Andy Murray already confirming that he will be leading Britain as it embarks on its second straight World Group campaign.

At least two of Murray, his brother Jamie and Colin Fleming, are likely to be picked in what will be the first tie since their last-gasp tweeting of support for Scottish independence on the day of the vote itself.

Smith, who is also Scottish, insisted that the players will be as passionate as ever about representing the United Kingdom as a whole, despite them being in favour of its break-up.

The former Wimbledon champion appears to have made his mind up only on the final day of the debate, and has since said he regrets how he expressed his view, having insisted throughout that he would keep any thoughts to himself.

‘I think you will see him pull the shirt on and work his arse off,’ said Smith. ‘Everyone will see their pride when the national anthem plays. You can feel very Scottish and be proud of Great Britain. He will fight one hundred per cent in the British shirt and tracksuit like he always does.’

The decision to host the tie in Scotland is unconnected to their views, and more down to the availability of the venue at relatively short notice and the fact that previous ties in Glasgow have been very well supported, even when the former Wimbledon champion has not played.

Murray ruffled some feathers with his tweet in support of Scottish independence, but later regretted it

‘The right to express yourself on something like this is okay. We had the biggest political debate in our history and there was a huge wave of national debate. There was the opportunity to do something different and it didn’t happen. Life goes on and it feels like a lifetime ago, everything is going on as normal.’

Jamie Murray and Fleming – both of whose careers have considerably benefitted from the specialist coaching and support that has come from being part of Great Britain – will be in contention to partner the world number six in the doubles rubber, as will Londoner Dom Inglot. James Ward, another Londoner, is in pole position to play the second singles.

Smith said that it is likely that an indoor hard court will be the surface used for the tie from March 6-8. ‘When we have played in Scotland before the atmosphere has been excellent and it’s important that Scotland gets to see world class tennis, there’s a lot of world class tennis down south for people to watch so it’s good that it gets to other places.’

Andy Murray is currently in London preparing for next week’s Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.
