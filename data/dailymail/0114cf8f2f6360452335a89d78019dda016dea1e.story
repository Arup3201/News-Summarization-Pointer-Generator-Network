A Playboy model has sent a message to her football star ex-boyfriend - that love is about more than just looks - by posting a series of scantily-clad images online.

Tilsa Lozano uploaded a series of seductive photos to Twitter as a way of showing Peruvian footballer Juan Vargas that he should have valued her mind and sense of humour over her body.

The glamorous model, also from Peru, claimed the 'raw' pictures were not Photoshopped - and were taken 'without pretension' to show fans the real her.

Sending a message: Playboy model Tilsa Lozano wanted to show ex-boyfriend Juan Vargas there was more to her than just her looks

Untouched: The glamorous model posted the pictures on Twitter to show fans real un-Photoshopped images

In one steamy photo, the model poses in high heels and a revealing blue swimsuit while in another she dons an orange bra and high denim shorts - turning her behind to the camera in a Kim Kardashian-style snap.

Despite their revealing nature, the images were said to be a dig at the model's ex-boyfriend - who failed to appreciate Ms Lovazo for her intellect.  

One of the beauty's friends claimed the footballer, who plays for ACF Fiorentina, was 'more into looks than real beauty'.

They added: 'She used to complain that he was only interested in her body and not her mind or sense of humour. 

'Looks-obsessed': According to one of Ms Lozano's friends, Peruvian footballer Juan Vargas did not appreciate the model's 'mind or her sense of humour'

One of Ms Lozano's friends said the model 'used to complain that ex-boyfriend Juan Vargas was only interested in her body and not her mind or sense of humour'

'I think these photos are her way of sending him a message saying beauty is more than a pretty face or great bum.'

On Twitter, the Maxim cover girl explained that the photos were taken behind the scenes at a shoot for a calendar.

While the professionally-edited snaps will appear on shelves around the world, the 32-year-old insisted that her fans should also enjoy the 'before' photos.

She said: 'I think that when the pictures are for a product like a calendar or a video the photos will obviously have changes.

'But it is also a nice thing to use a mobile phone and share them raw and untouched with fans.'

Various celebrities have drawn criticism for appearing to Photoshop images that they post online.

In April, Beyoncé uploaded photos of herself on a golf course - but the gap between her thighs seemed unnatural, according to fans. 

And earlier this year, Kim Kardashian's Break The Internet stunt drew waves of criticism over the unnatural size of her behind.
