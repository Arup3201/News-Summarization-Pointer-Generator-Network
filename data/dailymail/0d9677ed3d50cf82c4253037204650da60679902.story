This was the scene today as a huge blaze broke out at an alcohol distillery - sending flames and smoke billowing 300ft into the air.

Hundreds of terrified residents fled from their homes as the huge inferno spread through Alcohols Ltd in Oldbury, West Midlands, shortly before 10am.

More than 80 firefighters were dispatched to the blaze, and eyewitnesses described hearing loud explosions as thick plumes of acrid smoke could be seen from more than 15 miles away.

A burns victim has been taken to hospital after the fire.

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed that a man in his 20s was treated at the scene for burn injuries before being taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

A fire service spokesman said a 100-metre cordon had been put in place around the scene as crews attempted to contain the blaze.

Meanwhile, residents in the immediate vicinity are being asked to keep windows shut as a precaution.

Ambulance crews remain at the scene, continuing to work alongside the other emergency services.

The injured man was treated for burns to his hands and back, and given pain relief before being taken by land ambulance to a specialist burns unit.

Residents - some clutching family pets - scrambled to safety as they tried to escape the path of the terrifying blaze.

Incredibly, despite the ferocity of the blaze, just one man was taken to hospital after suffering burns to hands and back.

West Midlands Fire Service sent 15 appliances to the scene of devastation as hundreds of residents were evacuated from nearby homes. 

Residents living nearby spoke of hearing a loud bang at the factory and fleeing their homes, with some still wearing pyjamas.

Mother-of-two Neelam Dass, 37, said: 
'I heard a massive bang, I thought it was a car crash, but when I looked
 out the window I saw the flames. 

'I
 grabbed my coat and shoes and ran out on to the street and knocked for 
my neighbours to make sure they had got out. It’s just so scary, we just
 ran.'

Tracey Benoist, 47, who lives next 
door to the factory, said: 'I was watching Jeremy Kyle and I heard a 
massive bang. I ran up the stairs to look out my landing window.

'I grabbed my dog, a black Staffie called Lily and ran down the street.'

Eyewitnesses described hearing explosions at the site, which is near to a level crossing, as locals reported seeing thick black smoke from several miles away

Val Blakemore, 61, who lives opposite the factory had just come back from walking her dogs when she heard the explosion.

She said: 'I heard a massive bang and looked out in front of the house and all I saw was the fire, it was terrifying.

'I tried to grab my cats and my dog 
and get out of the house and my neighbour kicked down my back gate so I 
could get out and I called the fire brigade and got me to a place of 
safety.

'It’s absolutely terrifying, I’m so scared for my house.'

Eyewitness
 Ollie Clarke tweeted: 'When I took a picture as it exploded you could 
actually feel the heat hit you - and I was at least 1,000 metres away.'

Another witness said: 'We kept 
hearing explosions and you can see the flames from the street. I have 
never seen anything like it. 

'People were screaming but you couldn’t tell whether it was inside the factory or not.'

West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed one man had been treated for burn injuries and taken to hospital.

West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed one man had been treated for burn injuries and taken to hospital.

A spokeswoman said: 'We have treated one male patient for burn injuries. 

'The burns were dressed and pain-relief administered and he was conveyed to Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital 

'The building has been evacuated as well as a number of homes nearby. 

'We have one ambulance attendance, a hazardous area response team, a senior officer and rapid response vehicle.

'An air ambulance from Cosford is also in attendance.'

West Midlands Police closed roads around the area and said residents living 'within the vicinity of the fire' were being moved from their homes.

The force have also scrambled their helicopter to help with surveillance as the fire service tried to get the blaze under control.

Robert Ling, director of Alcohols Ltd, today confirmed there would be a lot of ethanol at the site of the fire.

He said: 'We are aware of a fire at one of our sites and emergency services are in attendance. 

'My senior colleagues are currently on their way to assess the situation. 

'Early indications are that all our staff are accounted for but it is still early days. 

'It is a dual purpose site, it is a gin distillery and we supply chemicals to a variety of distributors. 

'So there will be a lot of ethanol on site as well as a variety of other chemicals.' 

The chemical distribution company was formed in 1955 and their head office is in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire.

They describe themselves as one of the last independent gin distillers in the UK and say they use traditional copper pot stills which are over 100-years-old.
