A mother headbutted and then bit a woman's nose in a 'shark-style attack' during a children's pantomime at Butlins in a row over the victim's disabled son, a court has heard.

Tina Love, 29, from Dartford, Kent, lunged at mother-of-three Julie McDonald, 50, pinned her down and then bit a chunk from her nose.

The 'nasty assault' happened after a disagreement about a table during a Jack and the Beanstalk show at Butlins Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis, West Sussex.

A 3cm by 3cm piece of the victim's nose was found on the floor after the attack on April 11, 2013.

Chichester Crown Court heard the day before the assault there had been some 'interaction' between the McDonald family and the defendant.

Love's two young children were seen 'laughing' and 'swearing' at Ms McDonald's son, who has 'severe learning difficulties'.

Today a jury of seven women and five men took just 48 minutes to convict her of wounding with intent.

On the night of the attack, the McDonald family went down to the Centre Stage of the Manhattan Building at the camp to watch the pantomime.

After finding a table, which appeared to be free, the victim sat down but was confronted by Love who said: 'Oi, that's my table'.

The defendant then waved her finger in Ms McDonald's face and said: 'What are you going to do about it?'

Ms McDonald and her daughter continued to look for tables as the pantomime continued and made 'spitting sounds' as the defendant walked past.

Love then 'lunged' at Ms McDonald and 'headbutted' her before biting her nose. 

Rachel Beckett, prosecuting, said: 'Suddenly the defendant lunged at Ms McDonald and headbutted her, Ms McDonald fell back onto a seat.

'The defendant then got on top of her and bit her nose.

'She pinned her down and held onto her nose, Ms McDonald felt that her entire nose was being bitten off. She then pushed the defendant away.

'Ms McDonald was screaming in pain and felt blood pouring from her nose.

'While being booked into custody, the defendant said 'I hit her in self defence'.

Ms McDonald, a full time carer from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, gave evidence via videolink from Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court, and described the assault as a 'shark attack'.

She said: 'She the launched herself at me and I felt this person biting my nose with full force.

'I have never been bitten by a shark but that is the only think I can liken it to. It was like being attacked by a shark. There was this person biting my nose with all of her might.

'It felt like my whole nose was being bitten off. I was completely traumatised.'

The court previously heard how Love 'feared for her life' during the incident.

The mother of three told the court their heads 'collided', and added: 'I was on top of her at this stage - I was just terrified.

'I then just turned and I bit - I didn't know where I was biting.

'I was terrified - I just wanted her to stop.

'It was all so fast and I was shocked and I feared for my life.

'I did not realise at any time that I had bitten her nose, I did not know where I was biting.'

She will be sentenced at the same court next month.
