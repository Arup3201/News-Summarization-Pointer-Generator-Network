It is a quiet street where children happily play games and ride their bikes.

But residents have become alarmed at some far from family-friendly activity on their tree-lined avenue – NHS workers cavorting in their cars.

Police have been called repeatedly after nurses, hospital technicians, support workers and cleaners were seen indulging in lewd behaviour.

Controversy: Residents claim staff leave vehicles in their roads to avoid paying for parking at Darent Valley Hospital (pictured)

The incidents, on Powell Avenue, in Dartford, Kent, usually take place during meal and shift breaks at Darent Valley Hospital, just three minutes' walk away.

Now police have stepped up their patrols in an effort to stamp out the behaviour.

The problem has been linked to a reduction of parking spaces at the hospital.

Staff started parking on Powell Avenue to avoid paying for a space.

Mother-of-one Kelly Purvor, 29, said she was 'disgusted' after seeing NHS staff engaged in a 'sex act' in a car parked outside her home.

She called the police, who traced the driver and quizzed him, but ended up taking no action due to lack of evidence.

Miss Purvor said: 'We are trying to raise young children and we don't want to explain to them what is happening in these cars.'

Neighbour Colin Pearson, 34, said he spotted two hospital workers – one man wearing an NHS tabard or apron and a female nurse – in a car on the road.

He said they spent around an hour in the car and that it did not take much imagination to guess what was going on.

He said: 'They really need to wait until they get home.'

Neighbours have given some of the staff nicknames.

'Mr VW', for example, and a mystery woman, both dressed in nurse uniforms, were spotted in his Polo. Miss Purvor said: 'They said they were just eating their lunch. But I know what I saw.'

Kent Police confirmed that the neighbourhood police team was 'monitoring' the area.

A spokesman for the 478-bed hospital refused to comment, but Susan Acott, the chief executive of Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust, said: 'I am sorry to hear about the difficulties caused by the cars in Powell Avenue.'
