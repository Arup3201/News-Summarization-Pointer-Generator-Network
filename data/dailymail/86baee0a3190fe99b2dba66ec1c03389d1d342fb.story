The Muslim-hating subway pusher who killed a Queens, New York, immigrant when she shoved him in front of a train last month has revealed the victim tried to shake her off at the last second.

In a rambling interview with The New York Post from Rikers Island where she is in custody, Erika Menendez, 31, said she was furious the day she ended the life of the hard-working Indian-born Sunando Sen, 46.

'My mind was just racing that day. I was mad. I was just angry,' Menendez said.

'I was homeless. I was hungry. I was fighting with my boyfriend. He came running up the stairs, and I just got up and pushed him.'

Sen hardly had time to react.

'He was trying to shake me off,' she told The Post.

Clad in a prison jumpsuit with glassy eyes and greasy hair, Menendez professed her hatred for Muslims and Hindus and told The Post the murder of Sen, a Hindu, was revenge for 9/11.

But the massive loss of life that still haunts the nation isn't what enraged her.

'I'm not mad about the people. I'm mad because I liked the buildings,' Menendez said. 'I just wanted to hurt Muslims and Hindus ever since (9/11).'

She loved the World Trade Center buildings because she is a native New Yorker, she said.

She hardly showed emotion during the interview, The Post reported, but her eyes lit up when she began describing other attacks on people she believed were Muslim or Hindu.

'I've been beating up Muslims and Hindus for a long time. I just want to hurt them. I would punch them,' she said.

She told The Post that on December 29, Sen stood out from the other subway riders because of his religion but the horrific death may have been averted if she'd taken her medicine.

The mentally ill woman, who was last week deemed fit to stand trial, revealed to The Post that she hadn't taken her drugs that day because she hates the side effects, which make her 'shaky.'

She said she prefers to 'self-medicate' by smoking marijuana but she hadn't smoked a 'blunt' that day.

'If I smoked a blunt that day, I wouldn't have pushed him,' Menendez said.

As the remorseless woman described the subway killing, which was the second in a month in New York, Sen's friends struggled to come to terms with his tragic death.

'How could she do this to him? My hands shake. I can't be alone. I think of him all the time, all the time,' the woman he rented a room from in Queens told The Post.

She said her son was now scared to ride the subway.

'We were family. Who cares if he is Muslim or Hindu? He was a man,' she said.
