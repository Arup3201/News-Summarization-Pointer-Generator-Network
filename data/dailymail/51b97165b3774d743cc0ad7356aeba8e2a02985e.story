Most people associate going under the knife with backless hospital gowns and anaesthetic face masks, but that could be about to change.

The patients of the future could be wheeled out of the operating theatre still humming the Dirty Dancing theme tune.

Peterborough City Hospital is giving patients the opportunity to watch their 
favourite film while in theatre to avoid them needing a general 
anaesthetic.

Iris Quirolo, 75, had hip surgery while watching The Sound of Music. She is pictured with anaesthetist Richard Griffiths who came up with the idea

Older patients undergoing certain orthopaedic procedures are being offered a film or TV programme as a way of keeping them relaxed and happy while their operation is carried out using local anaesthetic.

The work is being led by consultant anaesthetist Dr Richard Griffiths who says this approach is proving to be of particular benefit to patients who carry an increased risk of reacting badly to a general anaesthetic.

He said: ‘Patients really relax when they are watching their favourite films. Some have told us the TV can be so captivating that they are unaware that the operation has finished.

‘One patient watched the Sound of Music while undergoing a hip operation while another recently had a knee revision operation while watching the BBC nature documentary series The Blue Planet.

‘But the most popular movie at the moment, particularly among our older female patients, is Dirty Dancing.’

He added: ‘I am pleased that this idea is proving popular with patients as it means we can reduce the number of general anaesthetics given to older patients. 

‘It is more common for this group of patients to experience unpleasant side effects coming round afterwards.

‘If they are happy to be awake and watch the TV, I am happy that they are going to have a better experience.

The 1987 film Dirty Dancing is said to be the most popular choice among elderly female patients

Iris Quirolo, 75, from Werrington in Peterborough, was one of the first patients to benefit from the new technique.

Ms Quirolo fell and broke her hip and required surgery to repair the fracture.

She had previously had a bad reaction to a general anaesthetic so was offered the chance to be awake, and watching a film, during the surgery.

She said: ‘I have had a general anaesthetic in the past and it took me ages to feel better afterwards. It made me feel terrible and I was dreading having to go through it again.

‘When Dr Griffiths told me that patients were being offered the chance to have a spinal anaesthetic and watch TV while the operation was going on I was really pleased and asked to have it straight away.

‘Dr Griffiths brought me a selection of DVDs to choose from and I decided to go for The Sound of Music as I love that film.

‘I wore earphones so that I could hear the film, although I did stop watching from time to time to have a chat with Dr Griffiths.

‘It was a good experience and a much better way to have an operation. I never expected this would be an option and I have vowed that if I ever need another operation like this I will ask to be able to watch TV again.’
