Prosecutors say a 25-year-old Colorado mother carried out a 'death sentence' against her two young sons when she locked them in a hot car to have sex with a boyfriend.

Heather Jensen sobbed loudly as her trial began Wednesday in Mesa County District Court.

While prosecutors are painting her as a 'selfish' and 'lying' mother, her defense says her actions need to be seen in the context of her poor intelligence, young age, and the fact that she had lost her husband two months earlier in a car accident.

Head down: Heather Jensen's trial began Wednesday in Mesa County. She is accused of accidentally killing her two young sons, 2 and 4, after leaving them in a car to have sex

Tragedy: Two-year-old William (left) died on November 27 in Colorado while his four-year-old brother Tyler (right) died a week later in hospital. The two had been left by their mother in an SUV with the engine running for 90 minutes

'It was a tragedy, but it was an accident. It was not a crime,' said public defender Elsa Archambault.

The tragic deaths of 2-year-old son William and 4-year-old son Tyler occurred on November 27, 2012. Just two months after her husband Eric's death, Jensen already had a new live-in boyfriend and she told him she was taking the kids to play in the snow.

She strapped the boys into their car seats and drove to Grand Mesa, east of Grand Junction to a snow park parking lot where she met up with a male friend to have sex.

At first, she left the two boys in the car with the heat on and the doors unlocked.

Devastating loss: The young mother lost both her sons in the tragic accident last year

Deadly: Heather Jensen dialed 911 on November 27 when she realized that her youngest son was not breathing in the back seat

About a half hour into her tryst, Tyler opened the door and Jensen returned him to the car, gave him her cellphone to play with and locked the child locks.

She then went back to her male friend's truck for more than half an hour.

In total, the children spent 90 minutes in the car and the investigation revealed that internal temperatures could have reached 140 degrees. The two boys died of hyperthermia.

Prosecutors say Jensen is 100 per cent responsible for what happened to her children.

'Ms Jensen created the situation that caused her children to die,' prosecutor Danielle Lewis said in opening statements.

Jensen failed three drug tests in the months leading up to her sons Tyler (left) and William's (right) deaths

But Jensen's defense says her poor decisions were a result of her low IQ.

Jensen has an IQ of 76 which makes her borderline developmentally disabled. They say she sought the company of the man because she was lonely, and that she was only trying to provide comfort to her children by leaving the heat on in the car.

But a boyfriend also told police that she had been smoking marijuana the day her children died.

According to the Daily Sentinel, in the months leading up to their deaths, she had failed a court-ordered drug tests three times.

Jensen's drug-testing was a mandate of her 18-month deferred judgement following a March 2012 arrest for domestic violence.

Her husband Eric told police that Jensen became violent after he confronted her about hanging out with friends who supplied her with Vicodin and Percocet.

Prior arrest: Before husband Eric's death, Jensen punched him in a fight and was charged with domestic violence

In and out of jail: Jensen has been arrested several times. She was charged with the domestic abuse of her husband in march 2012. After the death of her two sons, she was arrested yet again after fleeing Colorado to Florida

The charge would be wiped from her record if she stayed out of trouble and kept off drugs but she failed  tests on march 21, October 8 and October 26.

Following her boys' death, she even violated the terms of her probation and fled the state to Florida to stay with her family.

'I believe it would be a great opportunity for me to start my life over again in Florida, and being surrounded by all my family who loves me to help me get through the losses Iâ€™ve had in this past month,' Jensen wrote in the letter to a Mesa County judge. 'And I would greatly appreciate it if you will let me move on with my life in Florida.'

Jensen's request was denied and she was arrested at her mother's home in North Fort Myers, Florida on January 16, 2013.

Her trial is expected to last 9 days. She is being charged with  criminally negligent homicide, child abuse resulting in death and false reporting.

The jury deciding her case is made up of 10 women and five men.
