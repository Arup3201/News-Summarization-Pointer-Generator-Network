David Cameron plans to scupper Labour’s attempts to introduce a ‘Leveson law’ regulating the 300-year-old freedom of the Press, government sources say.

A communications green paper, which the Opposition could use to try to force legislation on to the statute book, is expected to be shelved.

Editors are meeting the Prime Minister today to discuss the industry’s response to last week’s 2,000-page report by Lord Justice Leveson.

The senior journalists were warned by Culture Secretary Maria Miller yesterday that the Government will legislate if they do not agree to set up a genuinely tough and independent self-regulatory body.

But, without the communications Bill, Labour will have little chance to force the issue.

‘That Bill is the only thing on which Labour might be able to hang some sort of Leveson clause, and it is going into very long grass,’ said one source.

The Prime Minister last week voiced ‘serious concerns and misgivings’ about Lord Justice Leveson’s key recommendation of legislative underpinning for a new regulator.

But Downing Street sources said he would tell the industry in Downing Street this morning that there can be ‘no delay’ in setting up a new system themselves.

Addressing MPs, Mrs Miller voiced concern that any legislation could be amended by future administrations to gag the Press, and warned it would harm the UK’s reputation as an advocate of free speech.

‘Can we credibly question and challenge others on issues of liberty and freedom if we place our own Press in a legislative framework?’ she said.

However, she made clear it had not been ruled out as a last resort if editors fail to agree to set up a new, entirely independent Press watchdog which meets the principles set out in the judge’s report.

‘The Prime Minister is clear – we will see change. That change can either come with the support of the Press or – if we are given no option – without it. Be in no doubt that if the industry doesn’t respond, the Government will,’ she said.

She confirmed the action envisaged by ministers ‘would include legislation’ if the industry’s proposals fall short of Leveson’s suggestion that a new regulator must be truly independent and able to impose big fines on errant newspapers.

‘We will not accept a puppet show with the same people pulling the same strings,’ Mrs Miller added.

However, asked by Penny Mordaunt, a Tory MP who had indicated she wanted the Government at least to consider an underpinning in law, whether she would concede a free vote on the issue in the Commons, the Culture Secretary made clear: ‘I’m hoping that there will be no votes on this.’

Despite another round of cross-party talks on the issue yesterday, Labour leader Ed Miliband again insisted he believed independent regulation of the Press backed by legislation could work.

‘A large majority of the public also want that change. That’s why we’re going to draft legislation, working with other parties, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, to show that independent, self-regulation, guaranteed by law, Lord Justice Leveson’s proposal, can work,’ he said.

Tory MPs who signed a letter backing laws to police the Press would not vote with Labour to force the issue, a ringleader said last night.

The intervention by the MP, who did not wish to be named, came as splits within the group of 42 deepened.

Seven of the signatories now say a tougher regulator without a law – as advocated by the Prime Minister – would work.

While most of the signatories stuck to their guns and believed some form of legal underpinning was unavoidable, a growing number told the Mail a robust new form of self-regulation would be the best course, and claimed the Labour Party’s refusal to accept it was ‘shameful’.

The letter, which circulated last month, was organised by David Cameron’s former press secretary George Eustice.

‘The Government said they want to produce legislation to show it can’t work, we believe it can.’

In the Commons, Deputy Labour Leader Harriet Harman said self-regulation had repeatedly failed to prevent unwarranted intrusion by the Press.

‘We need statute because the current system of self-regulation has failed year after year for 70 years and despite seven major reports,’ she said. ‘The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome.’

Miss Harman said Labour was drawing up its own ‘tightly drafted and forensic’ Bill to demonstrate that Leveson’s recommendations could be implemented without the difficulties feared by ministers.Labour sources said Mr Miliband was determined that it should be introduced. However, a Private Member’s Bill, which could be brought in by a single Labour MP, would stand no chance of becoming law unless the Government allowed time for its passage through Parliament.

The communications green paper has been prepared – but not published – with legislation to deal with issues such as internet piracy and public service broadcasting.
