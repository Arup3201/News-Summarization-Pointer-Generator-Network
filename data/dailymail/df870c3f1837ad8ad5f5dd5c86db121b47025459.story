The Los Angeles home of famed hairdresser Vidal Sassoon has gone on sale for more than £11million after he lost his battle with leukemia earlier this year.

The London-born stylist created one of the most iconic looks of the swinging sixties and it appears Vidal Sassoon loved to keep his home in the same simplistic style as his famed 'bob' haircuts.

Situated in the exclusive neighbourhood of Bel Air, the 6,400 square foot property boasts four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a lavish living room, media room and huge master suite.

For sale: The late Vidal Sassoon's mansion has gone on the market for a staggering £11.1million

Room with a view: The 6,400 sq ft estate features a large swimming pool set in grounds overlooking Los Angeles

Spacious: The bungalow boasts four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a lavish living room, media room and a huge master suite

The spacious bungalow, priced at £11,171,390 - $17,900,000 - also has an large outdoor swimming pool set in huge grounds with panoramic views over the city.

Designed by famed architect, Richard Neutra, in 1959, the property has been decorated in a simple sixties style.

Sassoon passed away at the Bel Air home on May 9, 2012, at the age of 84 after battling leukemia.

The sale comes less than a month after a host of celebrities from the world of fashion, film and hairdressing attended a memorial service at London's St Paul's Cathedral to celebrate his life.

Sassoon was married four times and was made a CBE in 2009. His widow, Ronnie Holbrook, was joined by his famous friends and colleagues including actors Sir Michael Caine and Jeremy Irons and hairdressers Nicky Clarke and John Freida as they remembered his life.

During his long-standing career, which he began as an apprentice during the Second World War Sassoon created a network of academies and lent his name to various hair products and salons turning his craft into a multi-million pound industry.

Some of his most famous clients included Quant, model Jean Shrimpton and film stars Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner.

Born to Jewish parents, Sassoon fought with the Israeli army in the War of Independence in 1948 and founded the Vidal Sassoon International Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism in 1982.

On his return to the UK after the Israeli war, he worked for famous London hairdresser Raymond 'Mr Teasy-Weasy' Bessone before opening his own Bond Street salon in 1958 where he began developing his creative, geometric cuts.

Sassoon told the Los Angeles Times in 1967 of his method: 'Whether long or short, hair should be carved to a woman's bone structure. Actually short hair is a state of mind... not a state of age.'

Back to basics: The property is simply styled - just like the famed hairdresser's iconic bob cut

Contemporary: The house was designed by famed architect, Richard Neutra, in 1959

Retro: The homes is sparsely decorated with sixties furniture and decor

His styles were embraced by the women's liberation movement who wanted an effortless look without having to spend hours styling and short hair that also looked feminine.

Sassoon's haircare mantra was: 'To sculpt a head of hair with scissors is an art form. It's in pursuit of art.'

He sold his business interests in the early 1980s to devote himself to philanthropy. The Boys Clubs of America and the Performing Arts Council of the Music Center of Los Angeles were among the causes he supported through his Vidal Sassoon Foundation.

He later became active in post-Hurricane Katrina charities in New Orleans.
