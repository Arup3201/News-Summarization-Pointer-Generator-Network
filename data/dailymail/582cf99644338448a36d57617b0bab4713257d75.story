Hells Angel David Richards was allowed to 'simply walk out' of a prison before going on the run for nine years

A convicted killer was allowed to 'simply walk out' of a prison before going on the run for nine years while managing to claim benefits and take holidays abroad, a court heard.

Hells Angel David Richards should have triggered a manhunt after he absconded from Sudbury open prison in Derbyshire in 2005.

The 53-year-old had been serving a life-sentence after being jailed in 1984 for hacking a teenager to death and using his blood to write 'Hells Angels' on a wall.

After his escape local police refused to launch a search and simply logged his disappearance on a national database.

Richards was only recaptured after the Daily Mail was tipped off about him, traced his whereabouts and spent a week urging police to act. 

In the meantime Richards was able to rent a flat, claim thousands in disability benefits and even went to Ireland on holiday after managing to obtain a passport.

Shockingly, while in Ireland he was jailed for three months for robbery without anyone even realising he was on the run from an English prison.

A court heard the killer - who had served 21 years for murder - was only recaptured on June 6 this year.

The Metropolitan Police were tipped off that he was living at an address in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, and arrested him at the property.

On Friday Richards was jailed for another two-and-a-half years at Wolverhampton Crown Court after admitting escaping from custody.

Sentencing Judge Philip Parker QC said the only appropriate sentence was a return to prison.

He added: 'The fact you were in an open prison when you decided to walk out must have meant you were relatively trusted.

'It may have been that you would have achieved release on licence at some point thereafter.

'I am told that, after your escape, you returned to the West Midlands where you remained until your arrest by police.

'Any escape is serious and if the person concerned is serving a sentence of life imprisonment it creates alarm and fear amongst the general public.'

The judge said, that as a result of his escape, Richards was now being held in a more secure prison and the prospect of his release had been severely jeopardised.

He added: 'The sentence I have passed merely marks the offence you have committed and it does not indicate when it would be safe to release you.

'That is a matter for the parole board.'

The court heard it was not immediately clear how Richards was able to claim benefits despite his status as a wanted man.

Prosecuting Tariq Shakoor said: 'He must have been deemed to be a dangerous offender because he was not subject to release until the parole board deemed it safe to do so.

Convicted killer David Richards was allowed to 'simply walk out' of Sudbury Prison before going on the run for nine years while managing to claim benefits and take holidays abroad, a court heard

'Sudbury is a Category D prison and he simply walked out of the grounds.'

Simon Hanns, defending, said his client, who appeared in court on crutches, walked out of Sudbury in frustration at waiting so long to be released.

He said: 'He went to Ireland and then moved back to Wolverhampton where initially he was caring for his parents.

'They were in ill health but subsequently it has been him who has been unwell.

'The dangerous offender of many years ago is a far cry from the man who stands before you today.'

Richards was jailed for life 30 years ago for the drug-fuelled murder of 16-year-old Michael Groves at his flat in west London.

He attacked the teenager with a knife, hammer and wrench - leaving him with 56 injuries before writing 'Hells Angels' on the wall in his blood.

Richards was sentenced to at least 16 years, but was deemed so dangerous that he was still in Sudbury Prison, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, in 2005 - 21 years later.

After his latest arrest his parents Eric and Patricia Richards said they thought their son had been freed and were shocked to find out he was a wanted fugitive.

Speaking from their £200,000 semi-detached house in Wolverhampton, Mrs Richards, 79, said: 'He rang me from a landline on my mobile phone just after 3 o'clock in the afternoon and just said to me 'mum, please don't worry but I'm in a police station.'

'He said "I've been set up. I've been arrested on suspicion of absconding from prison". He didn't say which police station he was in but told me not to worry.

'I was so shocked I broke down in tears at the kitchen table and it took me an hour to tell my husband what had happened. As far as we were concerned, and David was concerned for that matter, he was a free man.

'He never hid from anyone and was even claiming disability benefits. He's got one leg longer than the other and walks with a crutch and a walking stick.

'He can't work but he's so helpful to everyone and he's just a lovely, kind man. Its ridiculous that he has been arrested after so much time.

'He walked out of the open prison because he couldn't handle the stress and bullying he was going through.

'He only had a few months left to serve and we just thought he was free because no one came for him from the police. He gave our address for his mail and rented a flat nearby from a well to do couple.

'He never told them about his past because that's where it was, in the past and he was making a new life for himself.

'I don't think David even knew he was in trouble because he's been claiming benefits and even called the police when he thought someone was throwing stones at his windows.

'He's had a passport for heavens sake and travelled to Ireland so he's not exactly been lying low.

'The police and the authorities have had plenty of chances to catch up with him and it seems very unfair to do so now when he's been leading a law-abiding life for nine years.

'The people around here don't know about what happened (David's crimes) and I don't know how I will face them if people find out.

'David couldn't work. He was disabled and claimed benefits and his benefits paid his rent for him.'
