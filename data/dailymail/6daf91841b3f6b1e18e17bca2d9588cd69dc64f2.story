Chad Johnson has been released from jail after serving just one week of a thirty day sentence he was handed after patting his attorney on the butt in open court.

The former NFL player apologized Monday for disrespecting a judge when he slapped his attorney on the backside in court last week after he’d managed to get a plea deal in a high profile domestic abuse case.

Broward County Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh accepted Johnson's apology and cut back his jail term for a probation violation to the seven days he had already served since the rear-swatting. Johnson, a flamboyant wide receiver formerly known as Chad Ochocinco, said in court that he'd had time to think about why his flippant attitude was wrong — especially in a domestic violence case.

So sorry: After losing a plea deal for domestic battery last weak for patting his attorney's butt in court, former NFL star Chad Johnson apologized to the judge and a 30-day sentence became a week of time served

'I just wanted to apologize for disrespecting the court last time,' said Johnson, wearing a tan jail jumpsuit with his hands shackled at the waist. 'I apologize. I did have time to reflect on the mistakes I made in this courtroom.'

Attorney Adam Swickle said Johnson will fully comply with all probation conditions and hopes to resurrect his NFL career. The six-time Pro Bowler was cut by the Miami Dolphins after his arrest for battery; he played most of his 11 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals along with one year with the New England Patriots.

'He understands that this is the kind of situation that can derail a person's career,' Swickle said. 'We're very confident he will do what he should do.'

McHugh noted that in a previous hearing, Johnson had put his arm around a female prosecutor's shoulders, prompting her to tell him twice not to touch her. The judge also pointed out that when Johnson head-butted his then-wife, Evelyn Lozada of the reality TV show Basketball Wives, she suffered a three-inch gash on her head that required eight stitches. The judge called those injuries horrific.

First degree butt slapping: Judge Kathleen McHugh (right) refused to accept a plea deal that would have gotten Johnson (left) out of jail time for a probation violation stemming from a domestic violence arrest after he slapped his attorney on the butt. On Monday, Johnson apologized and was released from jail.

Quick exit: Johnson left court--and jail--immediately. He'll now serve probation and community service

McHugh ordered Johnson to perform 25 hours of community service and attend domestic violence counseling sessions twice a week during probation, and she extended his probation an extra three months through mid-October.

Johnson walked out of jail shortly after 4 p.m. ET and was met by his attorney, Adam Swickle, and sports agent Drew Rosenhaus. Johnson told reporters he was thankful to McHugh because she was the first person to get him to slow down and think about the path his life was taking.

'No one has been able to do it, not even my parents,' he said. 'I thank her. Everything she did was justified.'

Appeal: Adam Swickle, left, had pleaded with the judge to reconsider her jail sentence for Chad Johnson

No joke: Former NFL player Chad Johnson was sentenced to 30 days in jail when a judge refused to accept the plea deal after he slapped his lawyer's but in court. He last played an official game for the New England Patriots

In legal documents Swickle had asked 
the Broward County Circuit judge to reconsider her decision to jail 
Johnson for 30 days for disrespecting her court.

The
court had erupted into laughter when Johnson tapped his lawyer on the 
butt moments before the judge had been due to sign a plea agreement.

'This [laughter] is not Mr Johnson's fault,’ Swickle argued. ‘And he should not be punished for the actions of third parties.’

Unamused: Broward Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh didn't think it was funny when former NFL star Chad Johnson slapped his attorney's butt in court, so she sentenced him to 30 days in jail

Johnson,
nicknamed 'Ochocinco' for his old football jersey number, was sentenced
to 30 days in jail for a domestic violence probation violation by Judge
Kathleen McHugh.

He had 
previously reached a deal with prosecutors for community service and 
counseling to resolve a probation violation from his no-contest plea 
last year to battery on his then-wife, TV star Evelyn Lozada.

However, Judge McHugh decided to jail Johnson after accusing him of not taking proceedings seriously.

When she asked the 35-year-old if he was satisfied with his attorney, Johnson reportedly smacked Swickle's backside.

'I just saw you slap your attorney on the backside. Is there something funny about this?' Judge McHugh said on Monday.

Slapped: Chad Johnson, center, leaves Broward County Jail in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in August 2012. He will serve 30 days in jail after violating probation in a domestic violence case

'The whole courtroom was laughing. I'm not going to accept these plea negotiations. This isn't a joke.'

Swickle said the pat was Johnson's way of showing appreciation for his attorney's work on the case.

'Mr.
Johnson has been a professional football player in the National 
Football League for 11 years and patting another individual on the 
backside is viewed as a sign of respect and gratitude,' Swickle said in 
the motion.

The butt pat 
came as Johnson believed he would not have to go to jail, despite 
skipping meetings with his probation officer for three months.

While
his future now seems a little uncertain, in court Johnson had expressed
hopes that he might sign with another football team this year.

When Johnson was arrested in August, the Miami Dolphins released him and he hasn't played in the NFL since.
