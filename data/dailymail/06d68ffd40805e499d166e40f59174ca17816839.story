Playing video games in 3D can immerse players in an environment like never before.

But a study has claimed that in so-doing, the violence in violent video games is amplified.

This can cause anger in players more so than those who just played in 2D, suggesting the immersive effects of 3D gaming could be dangerous.

A study by The Ohio State University asked people to play violent games in 3D (stock image shown). They found that the effect of 3D could be too immersive for some

The research was carried out by Professor of Communication and Psychology Brad Bushman at The Ohio State University and published in the journal Psychology of Popular Media Culture.

Participants were 194 college students, about two-thirds of whom were women.

All of the students played the video game Grand Theft Auto IV for 15 minutes.

Half were instructed to play violently - kill as many people as possible in the game - and half played non-violently - they went bowling.

Playing quick-paced action video games such as Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed can boost your ability to learn new motor skills, researchers have found.

They say regular players seem to learn new sensorimotor skills, such as riding a bike or typing, more quickly than non-gamers do.

And they say the skills are highly in demand, and useful for many careers - such as advanced surgery, for instance.

The study was conducted by  The University of Toronto.

They played on a 17-inch 2D screen, a 96-inch 2D screen or on a 96-inch 3D screen while wearing appropriate 3D glasses.

Later, all participants reported their mood on a variety of dimensions, including anger. For example, they were asked to rate how angry, annoyed and furious they felt on a scale of one to five.

Results showed that for those who played non-violently, it didn't matter if they played in 2D or 3D - their levels of anger were relatively low and unchanged.

Those who played violently showed higher levels of anger than nonviolent players no matter how they played, 2D or 3D.

But those who played violently on 3D were significantly angrier than those who played violently on the 2D systems.

When people were asked to act violently in the game, they felt more angry in real life as well. And the effect was more apparent when playing in 3D rather than 2D. The study did not examine other forms of entertainment such as 3D movies. Shown is an image of someone using 3D glasses with the PlayStation Move

After playing the games, participants were asked several questions measuring how immersed they were in the game.

For example, they were asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 7 how much they felt they 'were really 'there' in the game environment' and how much they felt like other characters in the game were real.

Results showed that people who played in 3D felt more immersed in the game than did those who played in 2D, and that immersion was related to the increased anger felt by those who played violently.

'3D gaming increases anger because the players felt more immersed in the violence when they played violent games,' said Professor Bushman. 'As the technology in video games improves, it has the ability to have stronger effects on players.'

He added: 'The combination of violent content and immersive technology like 3D can be troublesome,' Bushman said.

'This is something that needs to be considered by everyone involved - electronics manufacturers, video game developers, consumers, parents and content ratings agencies.'
