You know a relationship is getting pretty serious when a woman asks the man in her life for advice on a subject as sensitive as lingerie.

Pippa Middleton and stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson certainly looked like a couple in love when she playfully pulled him into high-end boutique Petits Bisous during a shopping spree in Chelsea.

The 30-year-old sister of the Duchess of Cambridge spent some time browsing the store with Nico, 36.

He seemed taken with a turquoise ‘body’ with matching silk night robe in the shop window, which he smilingly pointed out to Pippa as they left the store.

The Bisou Bisou body from Mimi Holliday would set banker Nico back £96, while he would need a further £116 for the matching Beautiful Bottoms georgette Night Robe.

The couple, who have been together for about 18 months, kissed and cuddled outside the store before heading hand-in-hand down the King’s Road.

A relaxed Pippa was dressed casually in black ankle boots, dark Stefanel coat and a polka-dot top - also by Stefanel, and she was carrying a cappuccino-colour Milli Millu Vienna bag.

Petits Bisous – French for ‘little kisses’ – claims to provide a personal and private service specialising in ‘made-to-measure lingerie, corsetry and swimwear to fulfil your every desire’. It also offers wedding day lingerie and nightwear.

Last month the couple holidayed with Nico’s grandparents at luxury ski resort Lech in the Austrian Alps, as suspicions grew that an engagement may not be too far off.

Pippa revealed during her first public speech earlier this year how the figure-hugging gown she wore to her sister’s wedding in 2011 – after which she was nicknamed Her Royal Hotness – transformed her life. ‘As I have found out, recognition has its upside, its downside and – you may say – its backside,’ she joked at a dinner at London’s Savoy Hotel.
