As Wayne Rooney and Co fell to a 2-1 defeat at Swansea on Saturday afternoon, another Manchester United side were faring rather better elsewhere.

Oliver Rathbone's brilliant half-volley from 40 yards secured three points for the Red Devils Under 18 side away at Derby, a result which moved them into third place in the North Group table.

Rathbone, an 18-year-old midfielder who joined the club in July 2013, waited until the 90th minute before controlling a high ball  and unleashing an unstoppable lob with his second touch.

His goal was reminiscent of Wayne Rooney's spectacular goal against West Ham in March last year, an instinctive long-range effort which caught Hammers goalkeeper Adrian cold.

Rooney's strike - which won the club's goal of the season award for 2013-14 - was struck from close to the halfway line, about 20 yards further back than Rathbone's similarly audacious hit.

Lancashire-born midfielder Rathbone had entered the action as a substitute late on and took just a few minutes to have an impact, showing a neat first touch before his decisive second. 

This isn't the first time Rathbone has shone for United's Under 18 side this season, having netted a hat-trick against Blackburn back in October.

The diminutive midfielder stuck three times - including a long-range goal - to help his side seal a comfortable 4-1 victory at Brockhall.

Last month, Under 18 boss Paul McGuinness said of him: 'Oli is still behind physically but he's showed a lot technically, as well as a great deal of intelligence in games.

'He's one or two years behind with his physical development but has given himself a chance by working full out all the time.'
