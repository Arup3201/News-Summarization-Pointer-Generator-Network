Countless celebrities have gorged on creepy crawlies and bizarre sea food as part of torturous tasks on ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.

But
what was once viewed as something of a punishment may become a culinary treat if Ángel León's new menu is anything to go by.

The chef from a tiny beachside village near Cádiz in Spain has created a new menu based on his life-long obsession with the ocean. His main ingredient? Plankton.

Would YOU eat this? A chef (R) from Spain has introduced a new 21-course tasting menu using plankton (L) as the main ingredient

While plankton is most commonly known as a mealtime treat for fish and whales, Ángel León has created a 21 course tasting menu based on the sea-based bacteria, which he is serving up at his Michelin-starred restaurant for a tasty 105 euros.

Unsurprisingly, plankton isn't recommended for human consumption and even León has made himself sick when cooking with it in the past.

Speaking to Modern Farmer about his bizarre culinary experiment, he said: 'Ever since I started cooking, plankton has been on my mind and it has always been a challenge to recreate its flavors for my dishes.'

The self-proclaimed 'Chef of the Sea' teamed up with scientist Carlos Unamunzaga back in 2007 to begin cultivating plankton.

Experimentation: The self-proclaimed 'chef of the sea' believes that plankton have a vital role in the food chain and make the fish that eat it tastier. (R) An example of one of his quirky seafood dishes

León reveals that the secret to culinary success is to keep the alga lyophilized (freeze-dried) and then bound with sterilized sea water just before served to keep it fresh.

Plankton are any organisms that live in the sea and can't swim against a current

They are a vital food source for fish and whales

These organisms include drifting animals, archaea, algae, or bacteria

Many plankton are microscopic in size but some are as large as jellyfish

One of his new signature dishes is Alkalinity- a recreation of oyster and lemon but his quirky interpretation replaces the oyster with plankton.

León's experimentation's with plankton have led him to champion its role in the food chain because he believes fish that eat plankton have a fuller flavour.

Feeding fish with plankton also puts less pressure on the environment.

And León isn't stopping at just plankton. The adventurous chef is determined to open our tastebuds to a new variety of fish, including species that are usually thrown back into the ocean called 'bycatch.'

He added: 'I’ve always been obsessed by the sea and I have been on many different kinds of fishing boats.

'It was on one of them that I was struck by the amount of fish that were thrown into the sea for not having a trade name, which led me to start working to bring these poor "no-name" fish to haute cuisine.'
