Former two-weight world champion Ricky Burns has been left with only £228 to his name after his legal battles with Frank Warren.

The 31-year-old, who fights in Texas on May 9 against Omar Figueroa, has declared himself bankrupt this week with debts of £419,888 after a courtroom showdown with his former promoter.

Warren had claimed unsuccessfully for £1.8million in lost profits at the High Court in London last year after Burns joined Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom stable on March 11, 2013. But the judge also ruled Burns was not entitled to end the promotional agreement with Warren’s company and owed him commission.

Burns paid his own £200,000 legal fees and a further £170,000 to cover Warren's damages

Burns teamed up with promoter Eddie Hearn in 2013 amid frustrations over two postponed fights 

In December, Burns paid his own £200,000 legal fees and a further £170,000 to cover Warren’s damages and costs. The judge ruled Frank Warren Promotions owed Burns £102,000 in purses but said he was unlikely to receive anything from the liquidated company.

Frank Warren said: ‘I brought a claim against Ricky Burns because he wrongly terminated his management and promotional agreements. I offered to meet him to try to sort things out after he had terminated, but he did not take me up on this offer.’

A previous version of this story repeated a claim that suggested Eddie Hearn had encouraged Mr Burns to leave Mr Warren’s management. We have since learnt that the court considered and rejected a similar allegation and we have taken immediate action to amend the article. We apologise for repeating the allegation.
