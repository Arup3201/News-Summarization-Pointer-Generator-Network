Manchester City have revived their bid to sign Malaga goalkeeper Willy Caballero.

The 32-year-old is a firm favourite with coach Manuel Pellegrini who wants Caballero to provide top class competition for Joe Hart following the departure of Costel Pantilimon to Sunderland.

City have considered Brighton target Keiren Westwood who is a free agent but Caballero will cost around £7million.

Target: Manchester City want to sign Caballero from Malaga as competition for England keeper Joe Hart

Star keeper: Cabellero has long been regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in Spanish football

Alternative: Sunderland's Keiren Westwood is also a potential target for City and would be available for free

Gone: Manuel Pellegrini is short of cover for Joe Hart since Costel Pantilimon (above) left this summer

The Argentine is Malaga's highest earner and his buy-out clause is £16.5m yet the relationship between the two clubs means they will negotiate a more sensible price for a goalkeeper regarded as one of the best in La Liga over recent seasons.

City remain in the market for further additions with Eliaquim Mangala of Porto their main objective although they know Manchester United and Chelsea have registered an interest.

Still wanted: Porto's French defender Eliaquim Mangala is still a target for City who want to improve their squad

On their way: Barry (right) is expected to join Everton but Toure (left) has not told City he wants to leave yet

Although reports in Spain say that Yaya Toure wants to leave they have yet to have any confirmation from the player or his represntatives.

City expect free agent Gareth Barry to finalise his permanent move to Everton this week after the Goodison club agreed a three year contract with the 33-year-old.
