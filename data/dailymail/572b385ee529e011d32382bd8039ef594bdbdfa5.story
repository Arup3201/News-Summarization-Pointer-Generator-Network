Reaction: Arthur Stevenson-Hart became 'very giddy'

A Frankenstein food breakfast cereal designed for children and packed with additives linked to bad behaviour and hyperactivity is being sold in Britain.

Lucky Charms, which is imported from the US, is the first mainstream GM food to go on sale in this country.

The cereal, which is being sold by Tesco, is at the vanguard of what GM advocates hope will be numerous products to arrive in kitchens here. Its use of genetically modified corn is buried in small print on the package.

GM corn has been eaten in the US for more than a decade. However, critics of the technology argue that not enough research has been carried out to ensure these foods are safe.

Most GM corn plants have been modified in the laboratory to contain a toxin that kills pests that feed on them.

Potentially more alarming is the fact that the cereal contains a number of artificial colours that the Food Standards Agency urges manufacturers not to use because research found a possible association with hyperactivity in young children.

Lucky Charms is marketed as a nutritious cereal for children, but contains four suspect colourings – Tartrazine, Sunset Yellow, Brilliant Blue and Allura Red.

Tesco bans the use of GM ingredients from its own-label foods, including breakfast cereals, on the basis that British families have rejected the technology.

However, this ban does not apply to other brands and the store has also lifted its ban on the use of GM animal feed at farms that supply meat, milk and eggs.

General Mills, which makes Lucky Charms, points to its wholegrain content and describes the mix of corn, soya, sugar and marshmallow as ‘magically delicious’.

However, one father said Tesco was ‘letting customers down’ by selling it.

Paul Stevenson, a psychotherapist from Twickenham, south-west London, said his nine-year-old son Arthur became ‘very giddy’, talked incessantly and was extremely hyperactive after eating the cereal, which Tesco is selling at a premium price of £5 a box.

‘As his behaviour became more and more unusually hyper and lacking attention I then noticed that he was enthusiastically eating and talking about this new cereal called Lucky Charms,’ said Mr Stevenson.

‘I checked the box and found out that in very small lettering it said that it was a GM food.

Small print: Tesco says that Lucky Charms adhere to the 'relevant legislation' even if it may have adverse effects

‘I destroyed the packet and he calmed down the next day but I was very concerned and angry.’

It seems likely that the adverse reaction was caused by the suspect colours. There is a smallprint warning on the pack that the cereal may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.

Mr Stevenson said the cereal was on prominent display at the local Tesco and is sold in a packet that is ‘extremely attractive to little kids’.

Pete Riley, of campaign group  GM Freeze, called on customers to boycott Tesco. ‘The idea of promoting a cereal to children that is not only GM but also contains suspect colours does not seem to me to be the correct policy for a company that claims to be a responsible retailer,’ he said.

General Mills said it does not supply the cereal to UK stores and that Tesco had ordered its supplies from a third party importer.

The supermarket said in a statement: ‘We sell this branded product as part of our world foods range.

The product ingredients are clearly labelled and are in line with relevant legislation.’
