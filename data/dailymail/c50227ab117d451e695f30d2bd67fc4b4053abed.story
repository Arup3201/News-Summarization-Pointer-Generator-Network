For most people, it would make their skin crawl.

But not Scottish ex-pat Ian Maclean, who gets four Burmese pythons to wriggle over his body as part of a bizarre - and brave - treatment.

Mr Maclean, originally from Helensburgh, in Argyll and Bute, uses the slithery reptiles at a zoo to 'cure' an old arm injury in the Philippines.

It is a new massage craze that's sweeping Asia which, he insists, has nothing 'snake-oil' about it.

Ian Maclean gets four Burmese pythons to wriggle over his body - to cure an old arm injury

The grandfather said: 'A friend told me it would be great for my persistent arm injury, and it de-stresses you.

'Four Burmese pythons were my masseurs and masseuses. The slithering motion is actually really pleasant. The flickering of the tongue on the skin was a little uncomfortable.

'When all four snakes were placed on top of me they weighed around 250 kilos so it was impossible to get up.

'It's not for the faint-hearted. Once all the snakes are on top of you.you can't get up without the handler's help. So don't panic!
