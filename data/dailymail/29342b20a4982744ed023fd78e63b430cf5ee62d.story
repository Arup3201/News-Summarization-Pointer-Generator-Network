ABC reporter Anne Barker saw the events unfold from the finish line.

'I turned around and saw him almost crawling, clearly in trouble, but still trying to reach the line. He was barely a metre away,' she told the ABC.

'He was very white. Suddenly he just collapsed on the ground, rolled on his side and stopped moving.

'Ambulance officers ran over, put him on a stretcher and by then he was obviously unconscious.

'It was all the more distressing because runners were just streaming past him, so clearly happy to have finished, many unaware of what had happened.'

This year's death is the third in the iconic race's 43-year-history, with the most recent being 26-year-old British man Lee Marruage who collapsed and died 200 metres from finishing the race due to a heart attack six years ago.

It was reported that Mr Marriage was not a registered runner and had used somebody else's registration to take part.

In 2000 a man aged in his late 30s suffered a heart attack and also died during the race.

Former University of NSW professor Michael O'Rourke said at the time of Mr Marriage's death  there was generally one cause of cardiac arrest or arrhythmia during the City2Surt each year, but they were often revived thanks to the use of a defibrillator, reported Nine News.

The fun run event has been run since 1971.

'What makes the man's death in the #city2surf even worse...he was only 27 #depressing,' Marty King posted on Twitter.
