Independence Day is the quintessential holiday for enjoying the freedoms given all Americans under the Constitution. Most important among them is the pursuit of happiness.

LIFE Magazine has avidly documented the American experience, good and bad, over its long and storied history.

Helping them along the way was one of their first four photographers, Alfred Eisenstaedt.

Here she is: Miss America Winner Bess Myerson. She became the first Jewish woman to ever win the pageant in 1945 and Eisenstaedt was there to capture the historic moment

Though not born in America himself, Eisenstaedt became one of the foremost American photojournalists and included here are some of his photos that so perfectly define a bygone American era.

As America celebrates its birth as a nation, it also celebrates what makes it unique.

Eisenstaedt’s photos show Americans doing what they do best: looking hopeful and, of course, pursuing what the forefathers went to battle for: happiness. 

Hut hut hut: Alex Lindsay Jr., 10, in his football gear. Though that gear has changed, this moment of self-assuredness and giddy fervor can be recognized by any American

Life of firsts: Long Island teenagers Jane Fest and Irma Olswang receiving flowers to wear to a formal dress party, their first. A present-day American girl could certainly relate on the day of her first prom

Rabid fans: Suits have been replaced with cotton sweats, but football fans haven't changed otherwise. Thrilled spectators of the deeply American sport are captured here by Alfred Eisenstaedt

Life's a beach: Trips to the beach are a sacred part of the American summer, one perfectly captured here by Eisenstaedt

Eisenstaedt, though he was born in German, exemplifies that American spirit.

He fled his country after the Nazis took power and was able to make a life for himself in America doing what he loved, photography.

Over his career with LIFE, he produced over 2,500 picture stories and 90 covers.

All or nothing: A Howard University cheerleader leads the squad during a football game with signature American panache

Anythings possible: This small-town girl, no doubt with big dreams, was captured smiling on her tree-lined street by Eisenstaedt

No limits: English major Helen Johnson, 18, at the University of Kansas

He was lauded as the ‘photographer of the defining moment.’

The photos collected here are no exception.

Football games, first dances, beauty pageants, cheerleaders: you name the fun-loving American institution and Eisenstaedt had it covered.

Say cheesey: The Winkle family on the stoop of their small town home during World War II

American pastoral: A farmer's son hold a set of Hampshire piglets in Pennsylvania. The image of the farming family is indelibly American

Phoning home: A sailor speaks to family on a designated GI phone in New York

Greatest generation: An army private and his bride. War in America is part and parcel to the pursuit of happiness
