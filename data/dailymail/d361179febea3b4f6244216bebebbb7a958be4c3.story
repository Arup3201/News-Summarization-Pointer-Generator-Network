President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's have been meeting in Washington to give the two leaders a chance to reinvigorate an economic relationship between the two countries. 

The two days of talks, which began with a private dinner for Modi at the White House last night, are pivotal, U.S. officials said ahead of the summit. 

In addition to Obama's sessions with Modi, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry hosted a luncheon for the Indian leader.

This is the first time Obama and Modi have met, and it also is Modi's first visit to the U.S. since he was denied a visa in 2005 over anti-Muslim riots in his state of Gujarat three years earlier.  

Obama and Modi, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, said they had discussed a wide range of topics - from trade to space exploration to climate change to the Islamic State threat in the Middle East.

'We already have the foundation of a strong partnership,' said Modi, seated beside Obama. 'We now have to revive the momentum and ensure that we get the best out of it for our people and for the world.'

A stronger relationship between the United States and India, the world's two largest democracies, has the potential to provide a counterweight against China, whose muscle-flexing in the Asia-Pacific has rattled regional nerves.

Modi’s agenda in Washington includes a visit to the Capitol to talk with members of Congress and meetings with business leaders, rounding out his five-day trip to the U.S. 

This is the first time Obama and Modi have met, and it also is Modi’s first visit to the U.S. since he was denied a visa in 2005 over anti-Muslim riots in his state of Gujarat three years earlier 

Talks will focus on areas of mutual interest including trade and investment, security, defense and clean energy. Beefing up intellectual property protection and reducing constraints on American business investments in India will also be on the agenda

While the leaders did not announce big-ticket agreements on a number of issues, they vowed to work closely together in what amounted to an official clearing of the air from earlier this year when India expressed outrage at the arrest in New York of one of its diplomats, who was charged with visa fraud and paying her nanny less than the minimum wage.

Obama said he was impressed by Modi's interest in addressing poverty and growing India's economy, as well as his determination that India help bring about peace and security in the world.

'I want to wish him luck in what I'm sure will be a challenging but always interesting tenure as prime minister in India,' Obama said.

In a unique departure from protocol, Obama took Modi on a short motorcade drive from the White House to the memorial honoring slain U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

In a sign of the visit’s importance, the Obama administration invited Modi to be a guest at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters across the street from the White House and an honor reserved the most high-level U.S. partners 

Modi, who is fasting to honor the Hindu goddess Durga, drank warm water while attending two official meals, a White House dinner with Obama on Monday night and a lunch with Vice President Joe Biden.

'The prime minister is fasting and we keep taking him to dinners and lunches,' Biden quipped in a toast at the lunch. 'As we Catholics would say, that's an occasion for sin.'

Modi, who took office in May, received a warm welcome in the United States, even though he was denied a visa in 2005 over rioting in his home state three years earlier that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. Modi was exonerated by an Indian Supreme Court investigation.

Foreign ministry official Vikram Doraiswami told a news briefing that the two leaders agreed to negotiate a 10-year extension of a military cooperation framework due to expire at the year-end, and will stress counter-terrorism cooperation and joint efforts against militant networks.

The two sides also agreed to set up a contact group with the aim of resolving a liability issue that is discouraging U.S. investment in the Indian civil nuclear sector, and to work towards resolving a dispute over India's blocking of a landmark World Trade Organization agreement reached last year, the official said.
