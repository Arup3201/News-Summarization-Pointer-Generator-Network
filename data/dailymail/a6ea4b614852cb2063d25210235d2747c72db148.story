The targeting of supermarkets over the sale of kosher foods risks importing Middle Eastern violence to the UK, leaders of Britain’s Jewish communities warned last night.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council (JLC), which includes the heads of Britain’s main Jewish organisations, last night condemned boycotts and intimidation as ‘especially troubling’ for British Jews.

Their joint intervention came after anti-Israel protesters caused ugly scenes at a branch of Tesco over the weekend, while Sainsbury’s pre-emptively removed kosher foods from a central London  store amid fears demonstrators would ransack the shop.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews and Jewish Leadership Council warned retailers that boycotting products, as Sainsbury's did yesterday, 'gives the message that violence and intimidation work'

In both cases, protesters were accused of stirring up racial division. An upsurge of anti-Semitic incidents have been recorded in Britain and other parts of Europe since the outbreak of fighting in Gaza earlier this summer.

Sainsbury’s in particular was accused of tacit anti-Semitism for apparently bowing to intimidation.

They said: ‘The protesters behind this campaign have no interest in securing a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians and through such actions, risk importing the Middle East conflict to the UK, dividing local communities.’

The statement adds: ‘The community calls on retailers not to discriminate against or boycott any goods, products or suppliers, which would give the message that violence and intimidation work – an especially troubling situation for Jewish people in the UK.’

Gillian Merron, chief executive of the Board of Deputies, added: ‘Our shops are no place for a political battle ground. As a society we should be bringing communities together – importing conflict through produce on the shelves will neither serve us, nor the prospects of peace for the Israelis or Palestinians.’

Simon Johnson, chief executive of the JLC said: ‘We fully support the freedom of retailers to operate their businesses peacefully and without intimidation, and call upon retailers to act responsibly and avoid the retail environment being used to delegitimize the State of Israel.’

Anti-Israeli protestors ran amok in a Tesco store in Birmingham over the sale of Kosher food. Police officers were allegedly attacked and stock was thrown around the store

They specifically challenged trades unions to distance themselves from the protests which prompted one branch of Sainsbury’s in central London temporarily to clear its shelves of kosher food amid fears that anti-Israel protesters were about to ransack the shop.

Last night the TUC spoke out against intimidation of shop workers and Usdaw, which represents retailers, said it supported its members in protecting their safety and their livelihoods.

The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, are among religious leaders to have condemned anti-Semitic attacks in recent weeks.

Last night the National Union of Students, which supports a boycott of companies with links to the Israeli military, was asked to explicitly condemn the targeting of shops.

It issued a short statement explaining its boycott policy and adding: ‘NUS has reaffirmed its commitment to raising awareness of and combating all forms of racism including but not limited to, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, that may and have occurred in response to recent events in Israel and Palestine.’
