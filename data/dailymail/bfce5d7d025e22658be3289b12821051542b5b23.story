A Facebook friend request turned into a face slap and a very unfriendly encounter that landed a 27-year-old woman in jail for allegedly assaulting her own grandmother. 

Rachel Hayes flew into a rage and repeatedly slapped her 72-year-old grandmother because she rejected her friend request, police in Seminole, Florida, say.

The elderly woman said she didn't like Hayes' Facebook name - which is 'Rachel Frickin Hayes' - and told her granddaughter that if she changed the name she would add her to her friends list on the social network.

Not friendly: Rachel Hayes faces felony charges of abuse of an elder for allegedly slapping her 72-year-old grandmother Thursday morning

Hayes, a mother of one from Clearwater, was drunk at 3.40am on Thursday when she showed up at her grandmother's house in Seminole - outside Tampa - furious over the Facebook slight, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said. 

When the elderly woman answered the door, she allegedly smacked the elderly woman across the face several times. 

The assault only stopped when the septuagenarian was able to retreat inside her home and close and lock the door behind her.

She called police, who arrested Hayes on charges of felony battery of an elderly person. 

Records so that Rachel 'Fickin' Hayes has three previous arrests - including one for drunk driving and one for public urination.
