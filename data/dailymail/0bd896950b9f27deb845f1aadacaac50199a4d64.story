The boss of an under-fire hospital department hanged himself after the end of a workplace affair which he would not accept was over, an inquest has heard.

Mark Channell, 44, was found dead in a flat 200 yards from the A&E department of North Middlesex Hospital in Edmonton, north London, where he worked as a nurse manager.

The married father-of-two had been having an affair with a colleague named Rebecca Mills - but they had split up months before his death, North London Coroner's Court in Barnet was told.

Mr Channell - who lived with his wife Sarah, 37, a veterinary surgeon, in a detached two-bedroom house worth £285,000 in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire - was found dead in August last year.

Miss Mills told the coroner that that the couple had split up some months before his death, ‘but Mark wouldn’t accept it was over’. She arrived home from a holiday in the U.S. on the day he died.

His colleague Sharon King said she became concerned about him and called round to a flat he shared opposite the hospital. She had a key to the property and found him hanging.

Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Andrew Walker said no note had been left and although the dead man had ‘troubles’ there was not enough evidence that he committed suicide.

The inquest was told the ‘highly regarded’ Mr Channell wanted to leave the hospital for a job working for the London Ambulance Service, but became distressed when he failed to get this.

The A&E department was in the news last year when a Care Quality Commission report found managers were ‘firefighting’ as the hospital was ‘stretched’ due to taking in more patients.

However Dr Edward Lamuren, a lead A&E consultant who headed the department with Mr Channell, said he did not know his colleague - who was also as a friend - might harm himself.

Mrs Channell declined to comment on her husband's death. An employee at her workplace of the Cromwell Veterinary Practice in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, said she was on maternity leave.

A North Middlesex Hospital spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Mark was a much loved and respected NHS professional who worked at North Middlesex University Hospital for over five years as our A&E service manager.

‘He cared deeply about his patients, worked tirelessly and helped lead some important changes to the department. His death last summer was a totally unexpected shock for his family, friends and colleagues.’

The Mail on Sunday told last August how MP David Burrowes feared for his life as he waited almost 36 hours for an emergency appendix operation in the ‘chaotic’ hospital.

It was having to cope with 40,000 extra patients a year due to the closure of Chase Farm Hospital’s A&E in Enfield, north London, when only 26,000 were predicted.

The Conservative MP for nearby Enfield Southgate described how it took 12 hours to get a CT scan - because overworked staff forgot to enter his details on the system.
