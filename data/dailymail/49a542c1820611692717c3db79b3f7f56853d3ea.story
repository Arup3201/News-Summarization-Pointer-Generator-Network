A pit bull mauled to death a man who was apparently trying to save its owner from a heart attack.

Roy Higgenbotham Jr, 62, was savaged by the animal on Sunday evening while trying to revive David Wallace, 63, police said.

The two men appear both to have lived in the same house in Wheeling, West Virginia, which had been adapted to be two separate residences.

Protective: The animal lashed out as its owner, David Wallace, 63, was suffering a medical emergency

Wheeling police said they were called to the home and had to force their way in. At that point police say they found the two men, one of whom was unconscious and the other badly hurt.

They were taken to a nearby hospital, where both were pronounced dead. The pit bull, a three-year-old female, was also found in the room.

According to local news channel WTRF, the dog has now been quarantined.

Though police believe the dog killed one of the men, they have said the official cause of death is still undetermined, and that tests and autopsies are being carried out.

Wheeling police have said the dog was not on their register of dangerous animals. Neighbors who spoke to WTRF said they had never known the animal to be violent before. 

Home: Police had to break in to the house shown above in Wheeling, West Virginia, where both men apparently lived separately inside the same building
