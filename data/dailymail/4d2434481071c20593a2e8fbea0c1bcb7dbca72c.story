The Downing Street Plebgate row took a sensational turn last night after a police constable said the former Tory Minister he claims called him a ‘f****** pleb’ must pay him up to £200,000 damages, and be gagged from speaking out.

PC Toby Rowland, who claims he was abused by former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell when he refused to let him cycle through the Downing Street gates, has tabled his astonishing demands in court documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday.

Speaking out for the first time since the incident in 2012, the police officer insists Mr Mitchell DID use the term ‘f****** plebs’ – and in a dramatic twist, implies Mr Mitchell apologised for using the words.

Court claims: PC Toby Rowland, left, intends to launch a £200,000 libel suit against former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, right, claiming that he called him a 'f****** pleb' when he asked for the gates of Downing Street to be opened for him in September 2012

He says Mr Mitchell phoned him to say sorry afterwards ‘with the clear implication he admitted using the said words’ – but later repeatedly lied about it to try to save his career.

It is the first time anyone has suggested Mr Mitchell owned up to calling No 10 police ‘f****** plebs’.

The former Minister, who was forced to resign from the Cabinet as a result, has already stated that he rang PC Rowland to apologise for ‘using Anglo-Saxon language’.

But he has never admitted he called him a ‘f****** pleb’.

Now PC Rowland is demanding up to £200,000 in ‘aggravated damages for slander’ and has asked the court to grant an injunction to ‘restrain’ Mr Mitchell, and anyone acting on his behalf, from repeating his claim that Rowland fabricated the allegation.

As he fought to clear his name Mr Mitchell has been aided by Tory MP David Davis and senior Labour figures such as Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee.

PC 
Rowland’s request for an injunction would appear to extend to them and 
would mean they would also be silenced by court order.

Both
 Mr Davis and Mr Vaz would almost certainly refuse. In theory, the gag 
could apply to Mr Mitchell’s wife, Sharon, a family doctor who has 
vigorously defended her husband.

Conversely there are those who believe that Mr Mitchell’s ability to call on the help of friends in  high places has given him an unfair advantage in his battle with PC Rowland.

The bombshell new claims are contained in a statement of more than 10,000 words by PC Rowland to the High Court, setting out his libel claim against Mr Mitchell.

It says PC Rowland wants ‘damages including aggravated damages for libel, and if appropriate, slander’.

He also wants ‘an injunction to restrain [Mitchell] whether by himself, his servants, agents or otherwise howsoever, from further publishing or causing the publication of the same or similar words defamatory to the claimant.’

The controversial nature of parts of his statement are bound to raise the temperature in the breakdown in police relations with the Government as a result of Plebgate.

One policeman has been jailed for falsely claiming he witnessed the incident, three others face Metropolitan Police disciplinary hearings this week over other misconduct allegations.

And the Police Federation has been accused of using Plebgate to undermine the Government’s attempts to reform the police.

PC Rowland’s counter claims against Mr Mitchell, his demand for up to £200,000, and a gag on an MP, could further inflame tensions.

The stakes could not be higher: PC Rowland claims Mr Mitchell falsely accused him of ‘dishonesty and corruption’ and ‘humiliated’ him.

David Cameron is keen to restore Mr Mitchell to the Cabinet – but he has no chance of doing that if he loses the libel case to PC Rowland.

The former International Development Minister last night stood by his claim that he never said ‘f****** plebs’.

He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have always made clear that the police account of what happened that night is untrue. Thanks to good investigative journalism much of the truth has already come out.

‘There are ten police officers facing some form of misconduct inquiries for what they did and one has gone to jail, with three gross misconduct hearings taking place in London, starting tomorrow. My legal defence to these allegations will be filed shortly.’

PC Rowland says he wrote down Mr Mitchell’s ‘f****** plebs’ alleged comment in his notebook 90 minutes after the event and immediately emailed it to senior officers. Rowland also says:

Until now, PC Rowland, 43, has not uttered a word in public since the incident 19 months ago.

Rowland’s lawyer Des Browne QC states: ‘The claimant (Rowland) cannot say how much he expects to recover, save that he does not expect the amount in damages to exceed £200,000.’

Rowland’s ‘statement of claims’ filed to the court, declares: ‘On the evening of 19 September the claimant, on duty in Downing St, declined to open the main gate to allow the defendant to pass through with his bicycle, explaining it would be against security policy.

‘The claimant opened the pedestrian side gate for the claimant. The defendant said to the claimant: “Best learn your f****** place – you don’t run this f****** government, you’re f****** plebs.”’

The alleged comments were leaked to the Press and Mr Mitchell was forced to resign as International Development Secretary. But he claimed he did not utter the ‘toxic phrase’, joked about PC Rowland’s ‘alleged logbook’ and said he was the victim of a police ‘stitch up’.

PC Rowland says it meant Mr Mitchell had accused him of ‘fabricating the damning allegation that [Mitchell] had called Rowland and/or police “f****** plebs” ’.

Justifying his demand for up to £200,000 damages, Rowland’s lawyer declares: ‘He has been very seriously injured in his personal and professional reputation and suffered great distress, humiliation and upset.’

Mr Mitchell’s allegations ‘could not be more serious for a serving officer, let along one engaged in protecting members of the Government. The impact on his career could be devastating.’

Mitchell was ‘well aware how serious it was to make such allegations... he knew were baseless’.

PC Rowland says: ‘Initially [Mitchell] did not allege [Rowland] had lied. In fact he apologised [to Rowland] privately by phone not long after the incident.

‘The clear implication was that he admitted to using the said words.’

Mr Davis said last night: ‘The idea a policeman can ask for £200,000 damages from an elected Member of Parliament, ask a judge to gag them and to gag any other MPs or friends and relatives who wish to speak up freely for them, undermines the very democracy the police are supposed to safeguard.’

Andrew Mitchell’s claim that he is the victim of an orchestrated police smear campaign will receive a boost this week when three officers face gross misconduct hearings over their role in the saga.

The cases have been brought as a result of Operation Alice, the Scotland Yard investigation into Plebgate.

Two officers have already lost their jobs as a result: PC Keith Wallis, who was sacked from the force and sentenced to 12 months in prison for fabricating a witness statement purporting to be from a member of the public; and PC James Glanville, who was fired for leaking PC Rowland’s ‘f****** plebs’ version of events to The Sun.

Now two women and one man, all from the Diplomatic Protection Group, face the prospect of further disciplinary action. The first hearing, tomorrow, is for an unnamed constable accused of forwarding PC Rowland’s log to Glanville. Two further hearings will be held for a PC accused of falsely claiming not to have been in contact with Wallis, and for a constable accused of giving false statements to Operation Alice.

Both women have been suspended from duty, while the male officer has been on restricted duties. The fake email sent by Wallis to John Randall MP, the Government’s Deputy Chief Whip, proved fatal to Mr Mitchell’s career because it appeared to offer independent corroboration of the police log version of events.

It purported to come from a member of the public present outside the gates, and claimed that the incident had been witnessed by other tourists. David Cameron rang Mr Mitchell after reading the email and told him to quit the Cabinet.

Mr Mitchell has said that the emergence of the email was ‘the worst moment of my life’, adding: ‘Suddenly I realised I was being stitched up. I knew

it was false but I didn’t know what to do. I realised something terrible was happening to me over which I had no control.’

Mr Mitchell was given the nickname ‘Thrasher’ at school, and some say his reputation for high-handedness was why not all Tory MPs immediately rowed in behind him when the controversy broke. One said: ‘Andrew can have quite an off-hand manner about him at times.’

Mr Mitchell has continuously maintained he is the victim of a smear campaign. ‘If this can happen to a senior Government Minister, then what chance would a youth in Brixton or Handsworth have?’ he has said.

Mr Mitchell admitted swearing ‘in exasperation’ but always denied losing his temper. Central to Mr Mitchell’s argument is CC TV footage, released in December 2012, which cast doubt on the police account by showing only a brief interaction between Mitchell and the officer – and no tourists.

He received a further boost in October 2013 after a report from the Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded three officers had given a false account of a meeting they had with Mitchell at his constituency office in October 2012, and that the findings of a subsequent investigation had been changed at the 11th hour to recommend no disciplinary action be taken.

That prompted Mr Cameron to call for Mr Mitchell to receive an apology over the incident. The officers issued a statement in which they apologised for misleading the public.

Although this week’s disciplinary hearings will be held in private, Mr Mitchell has been invited to attend.

His demand for up to £200,000 damages is justified by the way  Mr Mitchell ‘humiliated’ him and his family.
