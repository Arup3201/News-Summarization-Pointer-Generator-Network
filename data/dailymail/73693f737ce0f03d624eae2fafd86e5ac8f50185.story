Sometimes being a cat can be a tiring life: all those catnaps between bouts of idle stretching in front of the fire.

But Dodger the ginger tom has found a way to get round the tiresome business of walking anywhere, by hopping on  the bus.

The 15-year-old sits on bemused passengers’ laps as the bus makes round trips of up to ten miles from Bridport to Charmouth in Dorset.

Where's your ticket? Dodger the cat has been riding the bus for free by hopping on and off at his local station in Dorset

He is such a regular passenger that 
some of the drivers take tins of cat food to feed him. They even know 
which stop to let him off at so he can return to his home and owner Fee 
Jeanes.

Mrs Jeanes, 44, believes Dodger, named after the Artful Dodger in Oliver Twist, first took a liking to the buses’ warmth.

She said: ‘We moved here 19 months ago
 and our house backs on to the bus station. He is an old boy and is very
 friendly.

Pugh's take on the travelling cat

'Sometimes he just sits in the middle of the road and waits 
for the bus to turn up before he gets on.'

'But then he started climbing on board the buses because they are almost like greenhouses when it is sunny.

'Then last week I found out he had travelled to Charmouth and back, which is a 10 mile round trip.

'I hadn’t seen him all morning until my daughter Emily told me one of her friends had just seen him on the bus at Charmouth.

'I
 couldn’t believe it and panicked. I got into my car to go off and look 
for him and then at that moment the bus pulled up near our house and low
 and behold he got off.

'He
 had fallen asleep on board and nobody knew about it. When the driver 
realised he knew who Dodger was and where he lived and kept him on 
board. 

'That afternoon I saw Dodger climb on board another bus and I rushed to tell the driver.

'I
 was shocked when she told me Dodger was always on there and liked to 
sit on the seats because they are warm from where people have been 
sitting.

Popular passenger: Dodger likes to sleep on paying passengers laps and even gets fed cat food by the bus driver sometimes

Proud owner: Fee Jeanes cuddles her cat once he's home from his bus trip

'The drivers buy cat food for him and he sits on people’s laps.

'Sometimes he just sits in the middle of the road and waits for the bus to turn up before he gets on.'

Dodger is familiar to regular bus passengers and drivers, but Mrs Jeanes still receives several calls a week asking if she has lost a ginger cat.

A spokesman for bus firm First said they didn’t mind Dodger on their buses but didn’t actively encourage him.

He
 said: 'The drivers have been asked not to feed it because we recognise 
that cat has an owner and we do not want to discourage it from returning
 home for food and shelter.

'But in principle we do not have a problem 
with it being around the bus station.

'Given this cat is elderly we suspect it would be eligible for free travel, perhaps a bus puss, if such a thing existed.'

Another bus-hopping cat, called 
Casper, died last year after being hit by a car while crossing the road 
to board the No.3 service in Plymouth.
