We all dread the moment when a relaxing holiday comes to an end.

For Samantha Disney, however, it was not returning to work she was afraid of but getting on a plane.

In fact, she was so scared of flying that she and her fiance ended up stranded for a month in Tunisia – and had to fork out an estimated £5,000 to get home

Traumatic: Samantha Disney and her partner Chris Young were forced to pay £5,000 to get home from a romantic week-long break in Tunisia after a panic attack meant she could not get on the plane home

The 32-year-old was whisked away on the week-long package holiday by her partner, who proposed during the trip. 

Right from the beginning, the romantic getaway did not go smoothly. 

Miss
 Disney, who has always been a nervous flyer, was prescribed medication 
to get her on the plane from Gatwick airport –  only to suffer a panic 
attack in mid-air. 

They made it to the all-inclusive Scheherazade Hotel in Sousse.

But as they prepared to fly home, Miss Disney was gripped by fear and refused to leave for the airport.

In
 2012, 11-year-old Joey Thompson was so petrified of getting on a plane 
home from the Gulf that his parents looked for jobs in the area rather 
than back home in Somerset.

And
 the Dutch footballer Dennis Bergkamp disappointed Arsenal fans hoping 
he would take a coaching role at the club as he revealed in his 
autobiography he will never fly again.

His fear has forced him to take great lengths to reach matches abroad, such as long car journeys and awkward ferry stops.

After
 flying her mother out to calm her down, she eventually agreed to get on
 a ferry to France before taking the Eurostar to England.

She and fiance Chris Young arrived at their home in Ramsgate, Kent, more than a month after flying to Tunisia.

Miss Disney said: ‘It ruined what should have been an incredible holiday. Chris proposed and we were really celebrating. 

‘This
 was just a blight on the whole thing. We missed out on work for a month
 and we were draining our bank balances. It was absolutely awful.’ 

The dog groomer said she had never suffered a panic attack before taking the outbound flight on July 16.

It escalated, leaving her hyperventilating and being sick throughout 
the two-and-a-half hour journey. After making it to the hotel, she was 
given tablets by a Tunisian doctor but lost her nerve again on July 23 
as they prepared to leave. 

She said: ‘I completely freaked out.

'I wasn’t breathing very well and I kept passing out.

'When
 we told the holiday reps, they read us a disclaimer saying if we didn’t
 get on the coach to the airport then we were no longer their 
responsibility.’

The 
couple returned to the hotel but had to pay £104 a night for their room –
 far more than during their package break, which cost a total of £1,600.

They searched for 
another way home and  found a ferry crossing a week later from Tunis to 
France. But moments before boarding, Miss Disney had another panic 
attack and refused the £160 trip. 

Her
 mother Deborah Savannah, 56, who also suffers from panic attacks, was 
flown out to calm her down. On August 15, Miss Disney was finally coaxed
 on to the ferry.

It took them to Marseille, where they boarded a £250 train to Paris before taking the Eurostar to Ashford, Kent.

Miss Disney said: ‘In total we must have spent an extra £5,000. The only saving grace was the hotel staff. They were fantastic.’
