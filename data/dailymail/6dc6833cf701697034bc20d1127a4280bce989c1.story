Middlesex batsman Ryan Higgins was denied a certain six against Sussex last Friday - by a brave seagull.

Higgins' shot hit the bird out of the sky, stopping the ball from flying into Sussex's stands for a six.

The venomous shot sent the seagull to the floor right smack in the middle of the crease.

That's a six? Ryan Higgins strikes the ball which looks to be heading for the stands

Higgins was left to rue his hard luck as he managed to claim just two runs due to the seagull's intervention.

The seagull on the other hand eventually found his feet and was reportedly unhurt, while Sussex bowler Will Beer looked on in discontent.    

Higgins did however finish the NatWest T20 Blast match as his side's top scorer with 31 runs to his name but Sussex won by six wickets.
