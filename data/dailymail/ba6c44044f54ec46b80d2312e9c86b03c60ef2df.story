Tragic: Autumn Elgersma, 3, died from head injuries after being 'thrown to the floor' by a woman running a daycare centre

A woman running a daycare centre in Iowa has been charged in the death of a 3-year-old girl who she ‘threw to the ground’ because she refused to take off her coat.

The Orange City toddler, Autumn Elgersma, daughter of Phillip and Jennifer Elgersma, died on Thursday from her head injuries after two days in hospital.

The child was injured in the home of Rochelle Lynn Sapp, 33, who runs a daycare centre at her home in 706 10th Street SE, in eastern Orange City, according to police.

Court documents say Sapp called the girl’s mother shortly after 9am and told her Autumn had fallen down the stairs.

Mrs
 Elgersma picked up her daughter immediately and brought her to the 
Orange City hospital where she was diagnosed with a head injury, 
according to KTIV.

The girl was airlifted to the Sanford
 Children's Hospital in Sioux Falls in North Dakota where doctors 
discovered the child suffered a fractured skull and brain trauma.

Admitted: Rochelle Lynn Sapp, 33, who runs a daycare centre in Orange City, Iowa, told police she got angry when Autumn refused to remove her coat

Devastated: Autumn's parents, Phillip and Jennifer Elgersma, lost their little girl after dropping her off at a daycare centre

Authorities say Autumn died two days later.

According to Orange City Police Chief, Jim Pottebaum, Sapp later admitted that she threw the girl to the floor after she refused to take off her coat.

Sapp was originally charged with Willful Injury and Child Endangerment Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury.

Chief Pottebaum said those charges will be amended because of the child's death.
