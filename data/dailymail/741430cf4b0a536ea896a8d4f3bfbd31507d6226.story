A Manchester City supporters group is planning a protest against UEFA during Wednesday's Champions League clash with CSKA Moscow - by urging fans to turn their backs while the European governing body's anthem is played.

The 1894 Group is urging fellow fans to show their frustration with UEFA's policy by facing away when their anthem is played at the Etihad.

Their anger arose two weeks ago when City fans were denied entry to the Russian side's Arena Khimki Stadium.

Manchester City fans intend to protest after being denied entry to the Arena Khimki Stadium two weeks ago after CSKA Moscow were ordered to play matches behind closed doors but 300 of their fans still snook in

CSKA were forced to field matches behind closed door due to persistent hooliganism and racist abuse

CSKA were forced to play their European home matches against Bayern Munich and City behind closed doors due to repeated hooliganism and racist abuse from supporters.

Travelling City fans were removed from the stadium or denied access altogether, while 300 CSKA fans were allowed in after acquiring tickets from sponsors of press accreditation for the 2-2 draw. 

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, 1984 group member Alberto Mombelli said: 'It's mainly about the way our fans were treated in Moscow,' says Alberto Mombelli from 1894 Group.

'It was even more disappointing when it was obvious that there were CSKA fans at the the game, while our supporters were even stopped from watching it from an office block next to the ground.

'With UEFA, it's all about sponsors and money, and they don't really care about the fans.

'Among City fans there has also been a lot of disappointment about the financial fair play issue as well. Uefa don't seem to have looked at how much the club is doing in Manchester.

'It's a feeling shared by other clubs' fans as well - Bayern supporters have been in touch because they are also disappointed with the way they were treated in Moscow.'
