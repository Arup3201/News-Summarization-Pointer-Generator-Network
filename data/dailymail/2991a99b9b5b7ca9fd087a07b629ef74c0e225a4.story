Host commentator

Three words that Deportivo players will be pleased to hear - IT'S ALL OVER! Eight goals from the away side mean Madrid cruise to an 8-2 victory.

Ronaldo bags a hat-trick, Bale and Hernandez net two each with Rodriguez hitting a stunner. 

Thanks for joining us, see you next time!

Real Madrid are in dreamland and Hernandez has his second of the game. He struggled to score from outside of the box for United but he's bagged to stunning efforts here. The second was a lovely right-footed shot that flew past Lux from 25-yards out courtesy of a slight deflection.

It's raining goals in Deportivo and it's substitute Chicharito with a stunning volley into the top corner. What a way to grab your first goal as a Galactico, control with his left and volleyed home.

Cuenca has deserved a gola this afternoon, but it's the substute Toche who heads into the bottom corner. The comeback is on!

78mins: Chicharito replaces Bale

And he has his hat-trick! Ronaldo adds to Depor's misery by knocking home his third goal of the game with a left-footed finish from just inside the box.

The way Depor have been defending, you'd think they were down to nine men! The last three Madrid goals have been all too easy.

Bale bags his second of the game and it's almost a carbon copy of his first. Hewas given far too much space on the left of Depor's box and sweeps the ball home once again. 

74mins: Ronaldo, in search of his hat-trick, fires towards goal only to be stopped in his tracks by Diakite. Deportivo make their final change of the afternoon as Farina comes off for Toche. 

71mins: Modric is replaced by Isco

Pete Jenson: With Benzema off, Bale and Ronaldo are now up-front in a 4-4-2. There really is no sign of Ancelotti moving Bale further from goal as has been suggested to him... and Bale has responded with Real's fourth goal. Isco on for Modric.

Bale gets in on the act after a delightful assist from Marcelo. The Brazilian played Bale down the left side of Depor's box, he held off his man before guiding a low effort past Lux. 

Ancelotti will be pleased with that has his team were going through a slight second half wobble. 

63mins: Kroos knocks a pass into Ronaldo, who looking to get around Sidnei. The Depor defender brings Ronaldo down as his shown a yellow card. 

Pete Jenson: Defensive midfielder Asier Illaramendi on as a second half substitute for Benzema - sporting a Xabi Alonso beard; all he needs to do now is start playing like him... cost 30m after all.

59mins: Benzema is replaced by Asier Illarramendi as Ancelotti looks for a change of shape to stop the Deportivo attack. 

57mins: Cuenca bombs forward before having another crack at goal. His deflected effort falls to Farina, but the Argentine sees his volley saved by Casillas. 

53mins: Madrid look slightly rattled by the home side's goal as Cuenca sees his effort blocked.

It's the perfect start to the second half for Deportivo as Medunjanin slots home a penalty. 

The spot-kick was awarded after the referee adjudged Ramos to handball a cross. The Spaniard received a yellow card for his troubles. 

And we're back underway in Deportivo. Can the home side make anything of the second half or will Madrid continue to run riot? Find out here...

Deportivo ring the changes as Juanfran and Cavaleiro replace Dominguez and Postiga. 

Pete Jenson: Deportivo have been reading to many 'Madrid in crisis' stories - throwing men forward at will and leaving huge space at the back.

Not to mention goalkeeper German Lux's decision to charge 20 metres out of his area and bring down Benzema.

Had Ronaldo not scored immediately he would have been sent off. Solid from Ancelotti's team, silly season from the home team. Both teams now back out for second half.

The half-time whistle blows and it's all but over already. Two Ronaldo goals either side of a Rodriguez stunner ensure Ancelotti's side go into the break with a commanding 3-0 lead.

It's three and Ronaldo has his second of the game. It was all too easy for Madrid as Benzema race through the middle before Lux runs out in a failed attempt to tackle the Frenchman.

The loose ball ends up at Ronaldo's feet and his whips in his second of the game. Awful goalkeeping from Lux.  

And it's two! Rodriguez doubles Madrid's lead with a brilliant left-footed striker from the edge of the Deportivo box. 

The Colombian received the ball from Benzema before unleashing a piledriver of a shot past Lux.  

It's there! Ronaldo powers home a brilliant header to put his side into a deserved lead. The Portuguese star leapt brilliantly to power an Arbeloa cross into the net from the penalty spot.  

26mins: Ronaldo fires off another shot after latching onto a Marcelo throw-in, but the Ballon d'Or winner fails to connect with the ball properly. 

22mins: Madrid, as you'd expect, are enjoying the lion's share of possession but they haven't tested Lux enough.

 

19mins: Marcelo works his way down the right and feeds Ronaldo, but the Madrid star can only drag his shot well wide from a promising position. 

17mins: Lux keeps his side in the game with a brilliant save from Benzema.

The Madrid forward found himself in the right place at the right time after a jinking run from Ronaldo but the Frenchman's snapshot is save well. 

12mins: Ronaldo sees his first bit of action as Rodriguez sails out to the right wing before whipping in a delightful cross to the Portuguese forward. 

Ronaldo's header, however, is easily gathered by Lux. 

Pete Jenson: Gareth Bale seeing plenty of the ball in the opening stages in the rain at Riazor. Just dropped a perfect right footed cross on Ronaldo's head but no finish from the Portuguese who has never scored here.

9mins: Deportivo come dangerously close to taking the lead as Cuenca unleashes a rasping 25-yard strike which forces Casillas into a fingertip save.

The former Barcelona man looks up for it today...

5mins: At the other end, a Modric free-kick is cleared well by Diakite. Ancelotti's side have been firing the crosses in during the last minute or so but Bale and Marcelo's efforts have come to nothing.

3mins: Deportivo enjoy their first attack of the afternoon as Ramos and Varane fail to clear a Cuence cross. Fortunately for the away side Postiga is adjudged to have committed a foul and Madrid can clear.

And we're underway at the Estadio Riazor. Can Real Madrid claim just their second three points of the season or will Deportivo continue their solid start? Find out here...
