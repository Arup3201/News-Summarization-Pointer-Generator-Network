A Sydney woman who allegedly murdered her abusive partner told police he was a 'psycho' and she just didn't want him to hurt her any more.

Jessica Silva broke down in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday as her trial was shown a police interview she gave the morning after 28-year-old James Polkinghorne was stabbed to death on Mother's Day in 2012.

In the video, Silva repeatedly wraps a brown blanket around her shoulders as she tells police how a fight had broken out between her, Mr Polkinghorne and her brother Miguel Silva outside her Marrickville home in Sydney's inner west.

On the night a Sydney woman allegedly murdered her estranged partner he had pinned her brother to the ground and screamed, 'I'm going to get you', a court has heard

'After he punched me ... he tried to punch me again ... and then I ran inside and I think I grabbed a knife.'

By the time she ran back outside, she said Mr Polkinghorne was on top of her brother.

'He was coming up with a big f***ing punch ... I have felt that punch before.'

Becoming increasingly hysterical, she told police: 'I wasn't trying to kill him. I don't know what I was trying to do. I just didn't want him to hurt me anymore.'

Silva is accused of murdering Mr Polkinghorne by stabbing him five times in the head and torso.

When Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside the family home that night, Silva's brother Miguel told the court he was 'screaming and carrying on' and that his sister was afraid for her and her family's life.

The 24-year-old has pleaded not guilty to murder on the basis of self defence, with the Supreme Court hearing she had suffered years of abuse at his hands

When Miguel went outside with his sister in an attempt to calm the situation, he alleged Mr Polkinghorne came quickly towards him.

'He tried to punch me. I think when I put my hand up, and he broke my finger,' Miguel added.

Moments later, the two men were on the ground with Mr Polkinghorne on top, grabbing Miguel near his throat, the court heard.

'Yeah,' Miguel replied.

It wasn't until their father came outside to help wrestle Mr Polkinghorne to the ground that he saw blood everywhere and noticed the 28-year-old had a gash to his head, the court heard.

In her interview with police, Silva said Mr Polkinghorne had been dealing and taking the drug ice, had previously taken steroids and had a few guns.

'He's a psycho. He has killed before,' she told police.

When asked who she was talking about, Silva replied: 'The guy that was on the news.'

Jessica Silva reportedly used this knife to stab her ex-boyfriend to death

The court has previously heard police were intercepting Silva's phone calls on the day of stabbing because Mr Polkinghorne was suspected of being involved in the shooting of Nicholas Argiropoulos months earlier.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald , Mr Polkinghore text Ms Silva on Mother's Day calling her a 'f---ing slut', saying she deserved to be raped and threatening to come over to smash up her parents' house.

'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now,' Silva says in one call to her brother Miguel.

Mr Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death

When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.'

'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'.

 Silva's father Avalino cried in court as he recalled how he saw his daughter swinging a knife on the day Mr Polkinghorne died.

'I have never seen my daughter like that,' he said.

The trial continues.
