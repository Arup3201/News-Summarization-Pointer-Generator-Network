Tragic: Beth Warren with her husband Warren before he died

Beth Warren and her husband dreamt of having two children – a boy and a girl.

But he died of cancer before they could start a family and she has launched a legal battle to give her the chance of realising the dream.

Mrs Warren, 28, wants more time to decide whether to have IVF treatment using sperm that her husband had frozen before his death.

The couple had been together eight years and married in a hospice six weeks before Warren Brewer, a ski instructor, died from a brain tumour aged just 32. He had agreed that the samples could be used to allow his wife to have their child after his death but, under the law, the samples will be destroyed within months.

Mrs Warren admits she may never be ready to have her late husband’s child. But she needs more time to decide whether to have a baby who will never meet its father.

She is not only grieving for her husband, but also her brother, Edward, a policeman who was killed in a car crash just weeks before Mr Brewer’s death in February 2012.

Mrs Warren, who took her husband’s Christian name as her surname after his death, wants to be financially secure before bringing a child into the world. The physiotherapist from Birmingham said: ‘I am still trying to make myself happy again – you don’t have a child because you are lonely and heartbroken.

I need to make myself whole again.  I want to be financially settled as well, so that my child can have everything I had. I am just a normal person who loved someone very, very much and lost them.’

Widow: Beth Warren, 28, has been told by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority that the sperm cannot be stored beyond April 2015

After falling ill just ten months into
their relationship, Mr Brewer stored samples of sperm ahead of 
gruelling cancer treatment that could leave him infertile. The storage 
was time-limited and, over the years, he regularly extended it.

He also explicitly agreed to the samples being used after his death.

Now,
unless the storage period can be extended, the samples will be 
destroyed in April 2015. This gives Mrs Warren little time to get over 
her grief. Or to have IVF, a stressful and invasive process that may 
have to be undergone several times.

And even if she did have a baby soon, 
the samples would be destroyed before she could use them to have the 
equally longed-for second child.

In
a case that will reignite the debate over the ethics of posthumous 
conception, Mrs Warren is asking the High Court for the storage period 
to be extended.

Her solicitor James Lawford Davies said that her right to use the sperm in IVF is not in dispute.

The legal issue is how long it can be stored for.

The lawyer, whose firm is not charging for its work, said: ‘She would like to be able to make the decision when she is ready.’

The 
fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority, 
said that it had ‘every sympathy’ with Mrs Warren. However, the storage 
period cannot be extended without her husband’s consent.

Mrs
Warren, who put her studies and career on hold to care for her dying 
husband, said: ‘We just fell head over heels in love. It was a long time
ago that we made plans that when we are engaged and married we would 
have children.

‘Ideally we’d have a boy and a girl and we talked about names. I am just trying to do the right thing.’

Mrs
Warren added: ‘‘I have the full support of Warren’s family in my legal 
battle and in whatever decision I make, and they have told me how proud 
they are of how I am dealing with the situation.’
