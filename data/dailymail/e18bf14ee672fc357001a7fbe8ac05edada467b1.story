Husband charged: Jerry Canfield, 72, is accused of shooting his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield, in the head at her own request 

A 72-year-old Northern California man has been charged with murder for what his attorney says was the mercy killing of his dementia-stricken wife.

Jerry ‘JC’ Canfield, of Alameda, was arraigned last week on a murder charge in the shooting death of his wife of 37 years, Joann Canfield.

Police say Canfield walked into the Alameda police station October 26 to confess that he killed his 72-year-old wife by shooting her in the head. He allegedly told investigators the two had previously agreed he would end her life if an illness left her in constant pain.

Assistant Public Defender Drew Steckler said police found physical evidence at the crime scene that corroborated what Canfield told them, including that he left a dozen red roses at his wife's bedside.

Mr Canfield is being held in jail without bail. He is scheduled to appear in court to enter a plea November 14.

The couple's neighbors in Alameda have spoken out in Canfield's defense, saying that the couple had been inseparable.

'You know, you've heard of being in love? Well, they were that,' next door neighbor Jose De Dios told ABC 7 News.

Another neighbor, Bridget Milet, also confirmed that the couple were as close as two people can possibly be. 

‘Whenever I'd see them, it restored my faith in married people,’ Milet told KTVU. ‘They just loved each other.’

The 72-year-old woman had developed dementia and her condition was rapidly deteriorating.

De Dios said Jerry Canfield once told him that his wife was seeing little demons that were chasing her around the house, causing her to trip and fall often.

A month ago, Mr Canfield was forced to put her in a nursing home, but his neighbor said he would spend every waking moment by her side.

On October 25, a day before the shooting, the husband brought Joann Canfield back home. Local residents recalled seeing the woman looking disoriented and unable to recognize anyone.

The following day, the 72-year-old man placed a bouquet of roses next to his wife's bed and shot her in the head to end her pain, as the two had agreed in advance, according to an affidavit.

Canfield then dressed up and drove down to the Alameda police station, where he told an officer that he wanted to make a confession.
