For sports fans, it could be a whole new way to watch - and really feel like you are part of the game.

American researchers have revealed a 'ball-cam' mounted inside an American football.

They have developed special software to process the footage, giving viewers a 'clean' video from the camera as the ball spins high above a football field.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Electro-Communications (UEC) in Tokyo say their camera could be used by TV firms and amateurs.

Because a football can spin at 600 rpm, the raw video is an unwatchable blur.

However, the researchers developed a computer algorithm that converts the raw video into a stable, wide-angle view.

'We're interested in how technology 
can be used to enhance existing sports and how it might be used to 
create new sports,' said Kodai Horita, one of the research team.

'In
some cases, athletic play may be combined with arts or entertainment; a
camera-embedded ball, for instance, might be used to capture the 
expressions on the face of players as they play catch with it.'

When the ball is thrown in a clean 
spiral, the camera records a succession of frames as the ball rotates.

When processing these frames, the algorithm uses the sky to determine 
which frames were made when the camera was looking up and which were 
made when it was looking down.

The upward frames are discarded and the 
remaining, overlapping frames are stitched together with special 
software to create a large panorama.

Similar stitching software is used 
by NASA to combine images from Mars rovers into large panoramas and is 
increasingly found in digital cameras.

Kris Kitani, a post-doctoral fellow 
in Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute, says a football league is 
unlikely to approve camera-embedded footballs for regular play, but says
the BallCam might be useful for TV, movie productions or training 
purposes.

Multiple cameras might also be added to the football to improve the finished video.

The researchers have shown that a camera embedded in the side of a rubber-sheathed plastic foam football can record video while the ball is in flight that could give spectators a unique, ball's-eye view of the playing field.
