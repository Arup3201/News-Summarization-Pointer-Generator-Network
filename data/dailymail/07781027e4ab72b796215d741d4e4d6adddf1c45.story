America, this Bud Light's for you.

At least that is what a new map showing every country's most popular beer indicates. 

The map was created using everything from research reports to corporate filings and it shows the 'beer brands of the world are as diverse as our planet itself'.

The most popular beer for each country was determined by market share and VinePair made the map

Bud Light is the most popular beer in the US, while Bud is tops in Canada and Corona is king in Mexico 

England prefers Carling over anything else, while Ireland opts for Guinness and Iceland goes for Viking 

The map was created by VinePair.

Although data wasn't available for every country - the US State Department recognizes 194 according to WorldAtlas.com - the map does include more than 100 countries. 

If data was available, VinePair determined the most popular beer for each country by market share. 

Australians go for Victoria Bitter while Lion Red is the top dog in New Zealand and Bintang rules in Indonesia 

Skol is the preferred choice in Brazil, Chile likes Cristal and Quilme shows up as Argentina's beer of choice

China likes a beer called Snow, Russians go for Baltika above everything else and India likes Kingfisher

Many of the beers on the map come from one of the two largest beer companies in the world's -A nheuser Busch InBev or SABMiller.

Anheuser-Busch Inbev controls the most popular beers in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Paraguay, Mexico, and Argentina, according to the Washington Post. 

SABMiller owns the most popular beer in Colombia, South Africa, Peru, Ecuador and other places. 

Tango is the preference in Algeria, Turkey goes for Efes and Gold Star is the gold standard for beer in Israel 

Carling Black Label Beer is No. 1 in South Africa while Windhoek Lager is the top beverage in Nambia

A previous chart from VinePair shows that six of the top twenty beers in the US are versions of Budweiser
