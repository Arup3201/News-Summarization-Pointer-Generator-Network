Having paintballs shot at you for a living may not sound appealing.

But an unusual job advert for a Human Bullet Impact Tester at UKPaintball has attracted more than 10,000 applications from around the world.

The firm, which operates at 60 locations across the UK, said it had received expressions of interest for the £40,000-a-year job from as far away as India, the United States, Canada and Croatia.

Candidates' comments included: 'I'm a rugby player... so I know physical pain. I can also break watermelon with my head. 

'I always dreamed of being face-covered by paint while screaming so I think I can be the perfect tester.'

Another hopeful candidate said he was fat - so easier to aim at.

Justin Toohig, owner of UKPaintball.co.uk, said: 'This incredible response is the last thing we expected when we posted the advert.

'We couldn't have predicted that so many people in the UK and beyond would want to get shot for a living.

'We've had individuals hoping to secure the job including an ex-Army soldier boasting previous experience of guns and weaponry, a paintballing enthusiast who has indulged in his hobby all around the world and an ex-magician's assistant who was once almost shot for real in an illusion that went horribly wrong.

'It's going to be a real struggle attempting to whittle down the thousands of applicants to just one. We have been so incredibly inundated with amazing candidates wanting the job that we are now considering an X Factor-style bootcamp for the a final 10, to see just who can handle being shot for a living.'
