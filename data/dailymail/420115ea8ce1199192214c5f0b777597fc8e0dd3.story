Cutting travel times, departure tax and opening Australia's regional airports to trans-tasman flights are part of a campaign to attract thousands more Kiwi tourists to fly our shores.

Tourism and Transport Forum (TTF) released its Bringing Our Neighbour Closer report today, which outlines proposed reforms including cutting the Passenger Movement Charge from $55 to $25.

The report also targets Asian tourists by recommending a common visa to allow them to visit both Australia and New Zealand in one trip.

Tourism and Transport Forum has outlined a series of recommended reforms to make it easier for New Zealand and Asian tourists to travel to Australia

TTF Acting Chief Executive Trent Zimmerman said up to 200,000 additional New Zealanders would be visiting Australia by 2020, with a increase to spending of up to $370 million if all the report's recommendations implemented.

Tourism Australia data shows there were 1.21 million New Zealand visitor arrivals into Australia in 2013, an increase of 0.9 per cent on 2012.

'New Zealand is our number one international source market, but we could see even more New Zealanders visit Australia by making it quicker, easier and cheaper and by opening up new points of entry,' he said.

Options for direct flights from New Zealand to Australia would open to the country's boarders to Kiwi tourists on the proposed trans-tasman flights

Options for direct flights from New Zealand include Canberra, Hobart, Newcastle, Sunshine Coast and Avalon, with routes to more regional airports such as Hamilton Island, Townsville, Mackay, Coffs Harbour and Ballina-Byron.

However, regional airports would face logistical and financial barriers to taking international New Zealand flights.

The call for reform comes on the back of a period of flat arrival growth, Mr Zimmerman said.

'Holiday visitors actually declined last year,' he said.

'It’s a market we have tended to take for granted and one that needs more attention,' he said of New Zealand.

'Streamlining check-in and customs and quarantine procedures at major airports would make flying from New Zealand to Australia like a domestic service, cutting travel times by around 25 per cent.'

He said the reforms aimed to reduce the door-to-door trans-tasman journey to under five hours and the report calls for the recommendations to be adopted next year.

'In 2015, it is time to not only celebrate a centenary of the ANZAC friendship, but also celebrate over 30 years of free trade through a new push to restart the Australasian free travel movement of the 1970s,' the report states.

A reduced cost common visa for Asian from countries including China, India, Thailand and the Philippines tourists could attract 187,000 visitors by 2020 and generating hundreds of millions in expenditure.

A spokesperson of New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), which covers the tourism sector, said New Zealand will host an Australian and New Zealand Tourism Ministers’ meeting in 2015.

'The Ministers will explore areas where our two countries can work together to build greater innovation and productivity in our tourism sectors,' the spokesperson said.

'New Zealand and Australian Prime Ministers announced in February this year that international visitors will only need one visa to attend games in next year's Cricket World Cup.'

The event is being co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia.

The spokesperson said between March 2013 and 2014 more than 1.1 million New Zealanders visited Australia and spending AU$2.3 billion.

New Zealand is Australia's number one international tourist source market

In a move to create a a more streamlined arrivals services, SmartGates are already used in eight Australian international airports including Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Gold Coast, Adelaide, Cairns and Darwin, with a total of 61 gates.

The two-step process allows passengers aged over 16 from five countries including Australia and New Zealand to skip arrivals queues when entering Australia using ePassports.

Passengers first place their passports on a kiosk scanner before being issued a ticket for a SmartGate, where a camera scans the passenger's face and compares it to their passport, which is normally done by customs officials.

Once complete the passenger can collect their luggage and as of this year, a further 20 SmartGate terminals were to be installed at Australian international airports.

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is working towards automating departures and has been trialling eGates at Brisbane International Airport, a custom spokeswoman said.

Sydney Airport confirmed it has 22 SmartGates and 26 kiosks and said they provide including reducing processing times and enhancing boarder security.

SmartGates are used in many Australian international airports help people avoid long arrival queues
