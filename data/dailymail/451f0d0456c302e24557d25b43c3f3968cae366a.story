Considering they included mustard gas and trench foot, the dangers to soldiers in the First World War were all too obvious.

But their wives and daughters hardly lived comfortably either - toiling on dangerous machines and making deadly materials such as asbestos to keep the nation from grinding to a halt.

A new exhibition reveals a very human side to the war effort - showing women smiling as they drink tea and carry tyres and rolled glass.

Life during wartime: Striking new images of women working during the First World War have gone on display at the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester.

Heavy load: Left, a woman working in the Charles MacIntosh and Sons rubber factory in Manchester, and another, right, carrying a piece of rolled glass at Pilkington Glass in St Helens, Merseyside. The huge prints are made from images taken by GP Lewis, an official photographer of the Home Front who specialised in heavy industry

The striking images were taken by GP Lewis, an official photographer of the Home Front who specialised in photographing women workers in the glass, vehicle and food factories which spread across Britain.

They were taken in the industrial heartlands of the north of England, from Lancashire to Merseyside, showing women manufacturing everything from grain to oil cakes probably used in animal feed.

The exhibition at the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester is designed to show how life during wartime shaped the society in which we live today.

Part of the centenary of the First World War this year, the outdoor exhibition features vast 16ft high black and white prints outside the museum's main entrance.

Visitors can explore a recreated trench to the sounds of war along with soldiers whispering, singing and even frying bacon. They can also sit at an interactive table which shows how food reached soldiers fighting in Europe.

Food for thought: A man looks at one of the images, which shed light on an often unreported side of the First World War while soldiers were serving in the trenches

Danger: Although the peril to soldiers abroad was more obvious, those back home faced hazards too. Pictured left, women worked in a factory in Lancashire making asbestos, a cheap and versatile fireproofing material which it would later be proved caused a devastating form of aggressive cancer. The exhibition runs until September

GP Lewis, the photographer, was known for his spontaneous and human style which contrasted with the staged, formal photos by Horace Nicholls.

Although conditions were terrible, the poverty of early 20th Century Britain meant it was better for many soldiers in the Army than it was back home.

For one thing, they would be guaranteed a daily meal with meat, a rarity if they were with their families.

Meanwhile for those left back home, the reverberations of the war would be felt in ways which few would have predicted - it arguably hastened the cause of women's rights.

Wives who had spent their whole lives at home were suddenly empowered and doing the jobs only their husbands would have done before. If they could work like men, some thought, why not be treated on the same level?

Most women were granted the vote in 1918, the year the war ended - although it took another 10 years before the right would be extended to those under 30.

The exhibition at Imperial War Museum North, Manchester, runs until September 28.
