Actor Sacha Baron Cohen has infuriated local politicians and residents of Grimsby with his portrayal of the town in his upcoming football-based film.

The British star, who is famous for his characters Ali G, Borat and Bruno; has caused fury among many within the seaside resort for his portrayal of the opposite sex.

Titled Grimsby, the comedy depicts the Conference Premier side's female supporters as 'revolting' 20-stone women.

According to an extra in Cape Town, where the film was partly shot, the women chosen by Baron Cohen are 'enormous'. 

'The gang of supporters from Grimsby are all enormous and revolting,' Maurice Maree, who worked on the film, told the Sunday Times. 

Local politicians have been outraged by the casting and the film's negative portrayal of the town. 

'Why pick on us? There are other places where obesity is a problem where they've got a rough deal. Why is Grimsby picked on all the time,' Austin Mitchell MP told MailOnline.

'I know it's a joke but I haven't seen these fat ladies anywhere - if they were so fat they wouldn't fit through the turnstiles at the stadium. 

'You can find fat ladies anywhere, we don't have an accumulation of them. We have the problems of a town which needs more development and jobs and its lost its basic industry. 

Local politicians have complained the film suggests Grimsby football fans are violent and overweight

Critics said the portrayal of residents and football fans as violent and obese created a 'very damaging image'

A local MP condemned Baron Cohen naming the film after the town, saying: 'You can find fat ladies anywhere'

'That's something to be helped and not made fun of. It creates a very damaging image.' 

Previously, councillor Matthew Brown told MailOnline he was 'disappointed' with the film.

'It is using the town's name in potentially a poor light. What also worries me is that there is no benefit to the local economy which is carrying the town's name.

'Anything that you associate with football hooliganism is going to be negative, but I hope people will be open-minded when they watch the film.

He added that depicting Grimsby as a town which has a history of football violence is wrong.

'My view is quite simple. We don't have a massive issue with hooliganism. There is very good stewarding at the ground. In general we are not in the same category as other clubs like Millwall who have a history of it.' 

A local councillor has also criticised the film of the film's portrayal of the seaside town

Besides claims Grimsby is  picked on due to its name, critics asked why the film was  shot in Essex and abroad

Among the women chosen to depict fans of Grimsby Town FC is Rebel Wilson, famed for her roles Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect in which she plays a character called Fat Amy. 

The Australian actress is seen locking lips with Baron Cohen in one scene, while his real-life wife, Isla Wilson, reportedly fills another on-screen role.  

Grimsby is scheduled for release in 2015 and see Sacha take on the role of a dimwit supporter of lower league team Grimsby Town. 

But while the town's representatives have been left disappointed by the way it is portrayed, residents have taken a more lighthearted approach. 

'Should be good, there's no such thing as bad publicity,' one said online, while another said Mr Mitchell 'had no sense of humour'. 

Local MP Austin Mitchell said the town's problems were no worse than in  other British areas

While representatives for the town said they were disappointed by the film, residents saw its comedic value
