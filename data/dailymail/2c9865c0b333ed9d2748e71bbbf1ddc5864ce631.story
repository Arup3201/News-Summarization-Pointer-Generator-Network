A squad of miniature chocolate Terracotta warriors wearing marzipan Santa hats is ready to wage sweet war this Christmas in China.

The 300 warriors were crafted by bakers at Xi'an Shangri-La hotel in Xi'an city, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.

Made from 100kg of Belgian chocolate, the edible versions are modelled on the country's Terracotta Army, a set of life-size ancient Chinese army sculptures from 3rd century BC. 

Good enough to eat: Bakers at Xi'an Shangri-La hotel in Xi'an city, China, created miniature chocolate models of the country's iconic Terracotta Army sculptures from 3rd century BC

The idea to combine a traditional Christmas symbol in the form of a Santa hat with the image of a Chinese Terracotta warrior formed from chocolate has proved a real hit for the upcoming festival.

The chocolate army took bakers ten days to create and was on display at the hotel. 

It has proved so successful that confectioners all over the country have made their own versions. 

With less than one percent of the country Christian, Christmas is not a public holiday in China.

But in recent years it has become a massive commercial success with Christmas gifts proving hugely popular with local consumers.

Bakers used 100kg of Belgium chocolate to make 300 Terracotta Warriors. The hats are made from marzipan

The original Terracotta Warriors are clay sculptures that were buried with imperial rulers over 2,000 years ago. 

They were rediscovered in 1974 by farmers in Lintong District, in Xi'an in Shaanxi province.

The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest warriors representing the generals.

The army also includes 8,000 warriors and 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses. 

The chocolate versions with Santa hats have not been welcomed by all with some Chinese social media users saying that they were a 'massive insult to Chinese people everywhere'

But the chocolate versions with Santa hats have not been welcomed by all.

After these images were posted on Chinese social media website Weibo, user LanWeiYu said: 'The Emperor would be turning in his grave if he knew what was happening with his funeral guard.' 

Another user added that the cheap commercialisation of one of the most spectacular parts of the country's heritage was a 'massive insult to Chinese people everywhere'.

User LuBay said: 'Christmas here is only about making money, and this is one of the worst examples I've seen.'

The confectioners however are continuing selling the Santa hat-wearing figures, which according to some users, not only look good but taste good as well.
