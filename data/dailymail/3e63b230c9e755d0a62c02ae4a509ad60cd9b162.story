Manchester City footballer Courtney Meppen-Walter (pictured) has been bailed following his arrest on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving

Manchester City footballer Courtney Meppen-Walter has been released on bail after being arrested over the deaths of a brother and sister in a road crash, police said.

Driver Kulwant Singh, 32, was killed with his sister Ravel-Kaur Singh, 37, when their red Nissan Micra collided with a silver Mercedes which the Premier League player, 18, was driving.

A second man, aged 19, who was driving a grey Volkswagen Golf, was also arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and has been bailed. He and Meppen-Walter are believed to be friends.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'Two men arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving following a fatal collision in north Manchester have been bailed.'

Ms Singh's sons, named by relatives as Amjit, 17, and Harveen, 16, were in the back seat of the Nissan Micra during the crash, and both suffered head injuries.

Amjit was last night in a critical condition at Salford Royal Hospital, but his younger brother’s head injury was not thought to be life-threatening.

The teenagers are understood to have lost their father some years ago.

Meppen-Walter, who turned 18 last month, had written on Twitter about passing his driving test at the first attempt and his excitement about getting his first car.

Yesterday his mother posted on his Twitter feed: ‘I’m Courtney’s mum and I’m devastated – please all his friends be there for him I love him so much can’t think without him.’

Meppen-Walter, from Bury, joined the 
academy at Manchester City, Britain’s wealthiest club, at the age of 10
and was a regular for England under-17s before progressing to the under
18s.

Currently out of 
action with a knee injury, the central defender has yet to play for the 
Premier League champions’ first team. The collision happened in North 
Manchester at about 10.15pm on Saturday.

Mr Singh was reportedly pulling out from a local Sikh temple along with his sister and nephews after attending a religious anniversary day.

It was at this moment that the silver Mercedes hit Mr Singh’s Nissan Micra, smashing it around 50 yards down the road.

He and Ms Singh had to be cut free from the car and were pronounced dead at the scene.

Meppen-Walter and the teenager driving the Golf were both held in custody last night.

Sources confirmed that the possibility the pair were racing one another was one line of inquiry.

Superintendent Neil Bhole, of Greater Manchester Police, refused to comment on ‘speculation or rumour’ about what happened but promised that a thorough investigation would establish all the facts.

The defender has not yet broken into Manchester City's first team, but was a regular for England Under-17s
