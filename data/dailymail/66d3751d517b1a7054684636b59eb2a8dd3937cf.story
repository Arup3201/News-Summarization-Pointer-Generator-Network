'Just to be clear, Lyon's medical and technical staff have set me a specific programme so I can be back at 100 per cent.

'That includes a period spent training indoors. That is why I have not been present at some of the training sessions.

'I have no problem with the club and have never missed a training session intentionally.

'There is no controversy and my intention is to be back on the pitch and competing as soon as possible.'

Lyon start their Ligue 1 campaign with a home match against Rennes on August 10, while their quest to compete in the Europa League group stages got off to a fine start with a 4-1 victory at Mlada Boleslav in their third qualifying round first leg match on Thursday.
