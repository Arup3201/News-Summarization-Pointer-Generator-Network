With an audience of rock stars, actors and assorted trendsetters, a fusty oration about fiscal prudence was clearly not going to suffice.

Yet George Osborne still managed to raise more than a few eyebrows with a speech to mark his naming as Politician of the Year by the men’s fashion bible, GQ.

The Chancellor took a leaf out of his foul-mouthed near-namesake Ozzie Osbourne’s book with a reference to the solitary practices of adolescent boys.

Proud: George Osborne with his Politician of The Year award and journalist Nick Robinson. The Chancellor let slip a swear word during his acceptance speech

Mr Osborne, at 40 the youngest Chancellor for 120 years, started with a touch of self-deprecation as he faced the crowd at the Royal Opera House.

‘I’ve just come from addressing about 300 bankers in the City of London and it says something about my profession that I was still the most unpopular person in the room,’ he said. ‘It is a fine recognition.’

'Thank you. I won’t reveal your secret past as chairman of the National Young Conservatives about twenty years ago.

'It is a pleasure to win this award. 
I’ve just come from addressing about 300 bankers in the City of London 
and it says something about my profession that I was still the most 
unpopular person in the room.

'It is a fine recognition. Of course,
we pay close attention to what Nick [Robinson] brilliantly reports on 
the 10 o’clock news, and what’s written in the pages of the Financial 
Times.

'I’m not sure who actually reads the 
politics pages of GQ magazine though, Dylan – I suspect they are the 
only pages of the magazine that a teenage boy hasn’t stuck together in 
reading the magazine.

'Some might say that’s because the w****** are on the page rather than reading them. Thank you very much for the award.'

In a reference to a fellow guest, BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson, he added: ‘Of course, we pay close attention to what Nick brilliantly reports on the 10 O’Clock news, and what’s written in the pages of the Financial Times.

‘I’m not sure who actually reads the politics pages of GQ magazine though. I suspect they are the only pages of the magazine that a teenage boy hasn’t stuck together in reading the magazine.

‘Some might say that’s because the w***ers are on the page rather than reading them.’

His words provoked groans among the audience, which included U2, Kylie Minogue, Salman Rushdie and Charlize Theron. A clearly surprised Stephen Fry, who took to the stage next to hand a gong to his old friend Hugh Laurie, told the Chancellor: ‘What were you thinking? Are you aware the magazine has male models? Were you thinking of Maxim?’

Mr Osborne left soon after winning the award.  

A colleague said: ‘This was supposed to be an off-the-cuff and self-deprecating joke at the expense of politicians, and was certainly not meant to cause offence.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson failed to raise the tone of the occasion when he went on to tell the audience how he was frequently described as a  ‘Tory t***er’. Before handing the Man of Next Year award to Olympics supremo Lord Sebastian Coe, he said: ‘I’ve been pounding the streets of Croydon, I’ve been hailed as I usually am with friendly shouts of, “You Tory t***er”.

‘I want you to know that I bring a message from Croydon, from all the businesses I’ve seen who are getting back on their feet, and that is that nothing and no one on earth is going to stop us preparing the greatest city on earth for the greatest Olympic Games that have ever been held.’

Two years ago as leader of the Opposition, David Cameron was forced to apologise for using the slang word ‘tw*t’ on a radio show.

In a reference to the social networking website Twitter, Mr Cameron had quipped: ‘The trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it – too many twits might make a tw*t.

He compounded the slip-up when he said people were “p***** off – sorry, I can’t say that in the morning – angry with politicians’.

While Mr Cameron’s aides pointed out that tw*t is not a swearword under radio guidelines and said he had apologised immediately for his latter comment, he later expressed contrition for his use of bad language.

‘You always have to be careful what you say,’ he said. ‘If I’ve caused any offence I obviously regret that.’
