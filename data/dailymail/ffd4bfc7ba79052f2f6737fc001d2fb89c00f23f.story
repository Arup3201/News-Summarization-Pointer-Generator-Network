It's been frequented by two former presidents, and now South Korea's longest-running dog meat restaurant is set to close.

Tourists and locals have eaten at Daegyo – which serves boshintang or dog stew – for 33 years.

But, chef and restaurant owner Oh Keum-il will serve her last bowl on Friday.

The 58-year-old's lifelong experience with a food eaten for centuries in Korea is about to become history. 

In her twenties, Oh travelled around North and South Korea to learn dog meat recipes from each region. 

She went to Pyongyang and tasted a dozen different dog dishes, from dog stew to dog taffy, all served lavishly at the Koryo, one of the North Korea's best hotels.

She adapted famous dishes to include dog meat, replacing beef with dog in South Korea's signature dish bibimbap.

Opposite views on dogs as either for eating or petting have co-existed in the country's recent history, feeding a controversy that becomes most bitter in the summer.

On three 'dog days,' which are among the hottest times of the year, many South Koreans queue for the dish of shredded dog meat and vegetables in hot red soup, believing it gives strength to bear the heat.

Animal rights activists protest nearby, urging people not to eat man's best friend.

The closure of Oh's restaurant, dubbed by a local newspaper as the 'Holy Land of boshintang' shows one view of dogs is gaining more traction among young South Koreans.

Most young people eat chicken soup on a dog day and even those who eat dog tend to refrain from talking about it openly, according to Moon Jaesuk, a 32-year-old researcher who enjoyed eating dog meat before he moved to Seoul.

'It's not easy to talk about eating dog when there are a lot of people,' he said.

'There is too much generational gap in boshintang,' said Oh. 'There are no young customers.'

Her restaurant used to sell as many as 700 bowls of dog stew a day in the 80s. These days it is less than half that.

Young Koreans also enjoy a diverse dining culture unlike previous generations that came of age amid the poverty that followed the 1950-1953 Korean War.

Sometimes the differing perceptions of dogs become a source of family tension. Kim Dongyoung, 30, said she gets into fierce arguments with her grandfather over her lap dog.

'Whenever he saw my dog at home, he would say it's the size of one bowl of hot soup,' Kim said. She recently pulled out of signing a lease for an apartment when she saw it was in the same building as a dog stew restaurant.

There is no official data on the dog meat industry, but people who raise dogs as livestock or supply dog meat to diners say its consumption is in decline.

Butcher Shin Jang-gun who supplies dog cuts to restaurants said the number of merchants in the dog meat trading business has shrunk to half of what it was.

He keeps a list of between 700 and 800 restaurants in Seoul, some current and others potential clients, and believes there was once more than 1,500

His father sold only dog meat for several decades. After Shin inherited the butcher shop in southern Seoul in 2002, he added goat meat to offset declining dog meat sales.

'Dog is not an industry with a long-term future,' Shin said. 'New generations don't eat a lot.'

Choi Young-im, secretary general of an association of dog farmers, said dog meat which used to be popular, has been overtaken by duck but will remain a fixture on menus.

Choi estimated between 2 million and 2.5 million dogs are consumed in South Korea each year.
