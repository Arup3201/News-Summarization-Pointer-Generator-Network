An MIT-educated tech pioneer who has a set of augmented-reality glasses bolted to his head says he was assaulted by three employees at a McDonald's in Paris, who tried to rip the device off his face.

Steve Mann captured the entire incident on his EyeTap device as his assailants demanded to know what the bizarre invention did and why he was wearing it.

The irony is that the only reason the camera on the invention stored the image of the perpetrators is because they broke it as they roughly shoved him out the door. Mr Mann says the EyeTap would not have otherwise kept the data on its hard drive. 

Augmented: Dr Steve Mann, a University of Toronto professor, has been wearing augmented vision computers for 35 years as part of his research. He has also come up with the MindMesh (left) as a means to controlling a computer directly with branwaves

Assault: The three men, one wearing a McDonad's shirt, another with a McDonald's name tag, not visible, demanded to know why Dr Mann had the glasses

Mr Mann was in McDonald's in Paris when the incident happened and hopes some staff will come forward to help

Dr Mann, a professor at the University of Toronto, is a leader in the field of augmented reality. He has worn a pair of computerized glasses for 35 years, he says, in an effort to develop a device that can help the blind and the nearly-blind see. 

The device is bolted to his skull and requires special tools to remove. It records video and streams it, with augmented data, directly onto his retina.

He posted his account of the incident on blog after repeated attempts to contact McDonald's about the incident left him empty handed. He says he only wants the company to pay for the device's replacement.

Dr Mann's EyeTap Digital Eye Glass was first developed in 1999 -- 13 years before Google introduced its vaunted Google Glass augmented reality technology earlier this years.

Questioned: This manager immediately questioned Dr Mann when he and his family entered the restaurant while they were on holiday in Paris

Broken: The irony is that the eyepiece would not have recorded the encounter if the employees had not broken it and caused it to store its final images

Dr Mann says he took his family to McDonald's on the Champs Elysee while on vacation to Paris last month. Immediately, an employee questioned him about his eye wear.

Dr Mann said he had brought along a note from his doctor to explain the device because he spent the day touring museums and famous landmarks. This was the only time during his trip that anyone demanded to see documentation.

The first employee was satisfied by the documents and let the family order.

However, when they sat down to eat, another employee came over and tried to rip the glasses off Dr Mann's face, he said. 

Two others then tore up Dr Mann's doctor's note and other documents and pushed him out of the restaurant.
