Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad took his shirt off in celebration before he even finished his race, and was then disqualified.

The French athlete was competing in the 3000m steeplechase at the European Championships. But before the race had even ended he removed his shirt in celebration. 

The officials failed to see the funny side and the 29-year-old was shown a yellow card for his troubles. Worse was to come for the Frenchman, though, as he was then disqualified completely.

Spain then protested that Mekhissi-Benabbad should be disqualified from the race, citing rules on 'clothing, shoes and bibs'.

Mekhissi-Benabbad had finished ahead of compatriot Yoann Kowal and Krystian Zalewski of Poland but after being disqualified the top three became Kowal, Zalewski and Angel Mullera of Spain.

France then appealed the decision but after around an hour's deliberation their appeal was rejected, making Kowal the new 3000m steeplechase gold medalist.

Mekhissi-Benabbad told the championship's official website before the disqualification was announced: 'When I took off my vest on the last metres, it was because of my joy, of course. It was the pleasure of winning. I was so happy to defend my title.

'The main thing was to win. I did not know that I was going to get a yellow card for that.'

'But this yellow card, this is nothing. It was just the emotion. Today I will enjoy my victory and we have to see how this evening will finish.'

Kowal said: 'What Mahiedine did with his vest was not disturbing or anything, nothing important.'
