Does anyone motor for pleasure any more?

They do on the Wild Atlantic Way, which snakes 1,553 miles down Ireland's West Coast from County Donegal to County Cork.

Two friends and I flew into Shannon planning to lay siege to some of West Ireland's famous golf courses, including Ballybunion and Lahinch, as well as sample the Wild Atlantic Way (or WAW).

A world wonder: The Cliffs of Moher, in County Clare, are an example of Ireland's west coast at its finest

But after settling in at our sinfully comfortable base - Moy House at Lahinch, County Clare, with its sea views, four-poster beds and well-stocked, self-service 'honesty' bar - we decided life was too short to whack dimpled white balls around the countryside with sticks.

Plan B was to hire a 'classic car' in which to cruise the Wild Atlantic Way.

Here, the first obstacle emerged.

The only one available was a 1970 MGB hardtop, with a very small back seat.

This would have involved one of us being packed and unpacked into it by Pickfords.

So we also rented a back-up Mini diesel at Shannon.

Two of us would ride in the MGB at a time.

The third would drive shotgun, admiring our progress from the rear.

On the road: The Wild Atlantic Way runs along Ireland's west coast for 1,553 spectacular miles

The MGB offered, as you'd expect of a modestly priced, Seventies motor: heavy, unassisted steering; vague, squeaking brakes; a high-minded lack of radio.

All features that might have an MGB enthusiast salivating, I concede.

Our diesel Mini was licence-threateningly swift, packed with bells and whistles and adored by all. Stephen said he was trading in his Audi A6 for one when we got back.

From Lahinch we proceeded, in convoy, to Liscannon and the awesome Cliffs of Moher, and thence to Doolin, with its Irish music bars.

We planned to stop for lunch at 300-year-old Linnane's Lobster Bar at New Quay, but couldn't find it on the map. So we stopped at a bar in Ballyvaughan, County Clare, for directions.

The sole customer, awoken from his mid-morning reverie, informed us confidently: 'I know it exists all right. I live there.'

We had to go right at the church, up the road past the big hay shed and we'd see a sign for Linnane's. Which, eventually, we did and enjoyed a marvellous, fishy lunch.

A perfect pitstop: The road meanders through a host of small towns and seafront communities

Along with two pints of Guinness and a glass of Chardonnay. Not each, I should add.

Swapping drivers from time to time, our curious convoy motored through the Burren National Park, a weirdly beautiful sea of 'fertile rock', so called because of its mixture of nutrient-rich herb and floral species.

One of Oliver Cromwell's officers remarked of it in 1651: 'It is a country where there is not water enough to drown a man, wood enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury them.

'Yet their cattle are very fat. The grass grows in tufts of earth of two or three foot square which lies between the limestone rocks and is very sweet and nourishing.'

We called on Martin Connolly, a cheery farmer on the Burren whose sons make delicious, dark Hazel Mountain chocolate, flavouring their product with berries and hazelnuts from the rocky hills above their property.

A grand old dame of the highway: Peter conducted his road trip in a classic MGB Hardtop

They now supply the U.S. billionaire Donald Trump at his new hotel and golfing complex at Doonbeg, on the Atlantic coastline of County Clare.

I don't suppose we covered more than 100 of the Wild Atlantic Way's 1,553 miles in our enjoyable, two-day visit.

But I will be back there to drive some more - and to hike parts of the magical WAW - or, ride a bike alongside the wild Atlantic.

The scenery's great, as is the food and the entertainment, but Ireland's people are its chief attraction. Their quirky sense of humour is refreshing, too.

Since we were all 'spoken for' (more or less), we were careful to drive straight through Lisdoonvarna, County Clare. Their 'match-making festival' was on.

Loose men and women - loose in the innocent sense of being 'free to marry' - socialised amiably on the main street.

How they laughed when we told fellow guests at the Moy - nursing their malts in the 'honesty' bar - of driving pell mell through the loose ladies of Lisdoonvarna in our squeaking MGB, the Mini as rescue vehicle in case of breakdown.

A great place to pull over: Peter's itinerary took him through Doolin, which is renowned for its music bars

Ireland's great poet, W. B. Yeats - whose home at Kiltartan, County Galway, we passed - said of one of his characters: 'He had an abiding sense of tragedy, which sustained him through temporary periods of joy.'

That's the Irish for you.
