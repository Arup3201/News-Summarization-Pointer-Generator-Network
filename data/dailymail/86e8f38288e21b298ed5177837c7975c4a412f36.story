These pictures give a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at a 700,000 sq ft supermarket distribution centre as Britain goes Christmas shopping crazy.

Goods were in storage at a Sainsbury's depot in Waltham Abbey, Essex, which employs around 1,200 people and covers the size of eight football pitches.

The depot makes 1,800 deliveries a week to 90 stores across London, Hertfordshire and Essex - and is gearing up for the final weeks before Christmas.

A British Retail Consortium spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘Judging from the week commencing 3rd December, footfall is building.

‘But we called it a baby step rather than a big leap. It's positive that footfall is building, but it's not in a big way as yet.'

Footfall went up 2.3 per cent week-on-week, but down 1.7 per cent
year-on-year,

She added: ‘Lots of shoppers are holding back on their spending in the hope of better discounts. But we're expecting it to follow last year's pattern. Things didn't look so good to start with, but the weekends just before Christmas redressed the balance.’

Meanwhile big discounts offered by retailers this weekend were tempting people out in huge numbers to high streets and shopping centres.

The festive season brought a welcome boost for retailers on the penultimate Saturday before the big day, as shoppers were out in force in London.

Jace Tyrrell, of the New West End Company, which represents 600 firms, said it had been busy at stores such as Topshop, Hamleys and House of Fraser.

She added: ‘There are discounts on selected items of up to 50 per cent, including 40 per cent at House of Fraser, and 30 per cent at Debenhams.

John Lewis has enjoyed a second successive record-breaking week of sales.

The department store revealed sales last week, up to Saturday, broke the previous week's record by reaching £147.8million, up 11.1 per cent on the same week last year.

The firm's website, johnlewis.com, also hit a new high of £43.1million for the week.

John Lewis said gift buying was fuelling the boom - including food, fashion, toys and technology, but the focus is shifting towards presents for women as sales of handbags, jewellery and beauty products are soaring.

Maggie Porteous, head of selling operations for John Lewis, said: 'With a further nine shopping days before the big event, it is excellent news to have already had two record weeks, both over £140million for the first time.'

‘We've had a strong performance in the West End recently. November footfall was up more than five per cent on the previous November.

‘In a way we are in a bit of a bubble here, with the tourists coming here, so there is a different feel in central London from the rest of the UK.’

Shoppers  in the capital's leading shopping hub Oxford Street would have been forgiven for thinking the New Year had come early with the number of stores offering discounts.

Bargain-seekers usually have to wait until after Christmas for businesses to start slashing prices. But those who left buying their presents until today and braved the heaving crowds were rewarded.

Shoppers flocked to outlets such as Primark and US clothing chain Gap, which cut prices by half on selected items.

Braehead shopping centre, in Glasgow, was in ‘full swing’, according to its general manager, Peter Beagley.

Selected shops will be open until midnight from Monday to Christmas Eve to try to catch as many shoppers as possible.

Mr Beagley said: ‘Christmas shopping is now well and truly in full swing. Braehead as a centre and the individual retailers are doing very well.

‘It looks like Santa will have trouble
getting his sack down the chimney if the amount of presents being 
bought at Braehead this year is anything to go by.’

Union
Square shopping centre in Aberdeen had a 7.8 per cent increase in the 
number of shoppers on Friday, compared with the same day last year.

General
manager Ryan Manson said: ‘We had an extremely busy Saturday, and with 
the last two weekends being the busiest of the year so far it's likely 
that we'll experience another record breaker this weekend.

'Friday alone saw over 50,000 people through our doors - a 7.8 per cent rise on the same day last year.’

David Wilkinson, head of marketing for Bluewater in Kent, said: ‘We are very busy, people are doing a lot of shopping and the restaurants are buzzing.

‘People are enjoying our Winter 
Wonderland, the ice rink is very full, and the Father Christmas grotto 
is proving very popular with younger families.

‘We expect there to be 230,000 to 240,000 visitors over the weekend, and that would be ahead of last year in terms of numbers.’

Staff at children's retailer Toys R Us said they have been experiencing a particularly busy weekend.

Richard Tarbutt, assistant manager of the outlet's store in Cardiff, said new versions of old favourites were proving particularly popular.

‘There has been a strong demand for 
Furbys this year,’ he added. ‘The original ones were released some 12 
years ago, but the re-released version has been a big hit.

‘Lego
has also been highly sought after. The whole range has always been a 
Christmas favourite, but the new Lego Friends - which is targeted more 
at girls - has sold well too.’

Dean
Stratton, centre manager of the White Rose Shopping Centre in Leeds, 
said he expected today to be one of the busiest of 2012, with an 
increase of nearly 50per cent on people visiting compared to a Saturday 
mid-year.

Price is right: The sales have been stealing the show when it comes to attracting people to London's world famous West End today

‘I'm expecting it to be very busy but 
we are up against some tough like-for-like figures from last year as 
this day last year was essentially the last Saturday before Christmas, 
but we've got another Saturday this year. The final weekend before 
Christmas is crucial.’

Shops and restaurants at the Trafford 
Centre in Greater Manchester have been reporting increased sales levels 
as they enter the final run-up to Christmas.

Gordon
McKinnon, director of operations, said: ‘It's clear that people are now
taking advantage of our extra-long shopping hours and plentiful free 
parking.

‘People are 
clearly using the Trafford Centre for a full day out, dining and 
shopping under one roof and getting all the gifts they need in one easy 
visit - particularly handy when they don't have to pay for car parking.’
