England will go into inquest mode on Monday morning and must confront the uncomfortable truth they are showing no sign of gaining ground on rugby’s leading nations, with 10 months to go until the World Cup.

On Saturday they suffered a fifth successive Test defeat — the worst losing run since 2006. 

This was their 12th consecutive match without a win against the Springboks, also stretching back eight years.

While there was talk of a narrow margin, the scoreline once again disguised glaring shortcomings — 14 English points came against 14 men and the Boks were short of their own imposing peak.

When the numbers were even, those in white were largely unable to find ways through the green wall ahead of them.

Instead of building momentum for next year’s tournament, England are struggling to maintain standards set in Stuart Lancaster’s tenure as head coach. Defeats by New Zealand and South Africa have left them in crisis going into their remaining QBE series clashes with Samoa and Australia.

Those fixtures must lead to an urgent upturn in performance and results, otherwise all talk of progress will be exposed as hollow. As it is, the situation is critical and here are the pressing issues that need to be addressed…

Cut out the errors

England are making too many fundamental errors in handling and kicking, along with all the other lapses in timing and discipline which led to missed scoring chances or penalties being conceded.

Dave Attwood made a searing break in the first half on Saturday but delayed his pass and a certain try was squandered.

These are the margins. Even when conditions improved, there were too many fumbles and spills and misjudgments. New Zealand’s dominance is founded on superb consistency in their catch-and-pass skills. It is not a mystery formula; it comes down to accuracy when the heat is on. England lack that edge.

Playing smart

This was a much-repeated theme during the post-match discussions. There was once again a lack of English composure and authority in terms of decision-making. 

Wrong options were taken by scrambled minds, stalked by doubts, as typified by Danny Care’s intercepted pass which led to Jan Serfontein storming clear to score from halfway, and Owen Farrell’s ill-advised attempt to launch a counter-attack from his own 22 early on.

Players are selected in part due to their natural instincts but somehow these are being eroded in the Test environment. Better ability to read the flow of the game and adapt on the hoof is needed.

Trouble at No 10

The faith shown in Owen Farrell by the management has become dangerously excessive. It is turning into a blind spot. 

It appears that George Ford will start at fly-half against Samoa and his promotion is overdue. England have to consider other options and accept that their first-choice playmaker’s game is in tatters at the moment.

The delay in removing him on Saturday was damaging. The Saracen was clearly in discomfort and his kicking from hand had become a grave problem. 

He appeared hesitant in attacking the opposition’s defensive line and releasing runners around him. 

It was noticeable how Ford — aided and abetted by Ben Youngs’ dynamic work — managed to create space after coming on.

Kicking woes

This is not just about Farrell, it is a more general concern in terms of the balance of the team and the lack of impact in this key area. 

England have spoken about their quest to deliver more contestable kicks, but the results remain mixed.

South Africa caused trouble with a clever range of astute high kicks and chips into space, such as the one with which Patrick Lambie paved the way for Cobus Reinach’s try. 

Farrell and Care have struggled with their in-field kicking and England’s touch-finding efforts are a major concern. With a midfield combination of Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt, Lancaster is short of front-line kicking options.

Wasted wings

Look what happened when Jonny May was given the ball in space against New Zealand — he left them in his vapour trail to conjure a superb solo try. Sadly, those moments are rare. England are simply not utilising the firepower at their disposal.

May and Anthony Watson were rarely released to stretch the Springboks with their blistering pace. Conditions have played their part in the last two games — necessarily narrowing the approach — but nevertheless, the inability to free strike runners is a concern.

There had been an expansion of the attacking gameplan this year, based on a clever range of distribution, but it is still all too rare that England go wide and manage to circumvent the best defences.

Breakdown bother

The rolling maul was a productive weapon on both sides at Twickenham but England continue to suffer against teams who are more effective at rucks.

The Boks won too many turnovers for English comfort as home carriers were too often isolated and support was too slow to arrive.

Lancaster’s men have been unable to fight fire with fire in this regard — relying on collective force due to a dearth of established poachers. 

They are missing the positive breakdown impact made by Joe Launchbury and Dan Cole, among others.

Taking ‘positives’

This phrase should be banished from the England set-up. Amid all the talk of Test defeats hurting like hell, especially those at home, there is far too much willingness to apply spin.

Coaches must set the tone by refusing to take minor consolations from bad results with a view to forward-planning. A young team is chosen because it is regarded as England’s finest available line-up, in which case it must be judged accordingly.

Of course there will be a background focus on preparing for the World Cup next year but in their current predicament, England’s first priority must be beating Samoa and Australia. The sole ‘positive’ on England’s radar has to be dispatching all-comers to revive their momentum.

Home rule matters

The grand English plan involves Twickenham becoming a fortress ahead of the 2015 showpiece event in this country, but it’s not happening — far from it.

New Zealand and South Africa expect to win in London as a matter of routine and even troubled Australia will arrive with hope later this month.

In the absence of victories, all the innovations designed to ignite the crowd at HQ and raise the volume are not really working.

Players walking in from the car park inside a tight cordon of stewards and numerous flashing screens imploring England fans to ‘carry them home’ are not the factors which will terrify opponents.

Twickenham is no Millennium Stadium or Ellis Park. It is no bear-pit. The only way it will become a forbidding place is by the hosts winning there and gradually building up a sense of dread in away teams.
