Kevin Pietersen insisted he would listen to any offer to return as England selectors met on Friday to decide which players are set for World Cup duty.

The batsman's international career looks to be over after he was ditched from the England set-up following last winter's heavy Ashes defeat, and went on to write a controversial autobiography.

But Pietersen wrote on Twitter as the selectors prepared to mull their options that his 'phone is on' and, in response to a fellow user asking if he would take a call from the national team management, he replied: 'Of course!'

Kevin Pietersen fired a blistering 66 for Melbourne Stars in Australia's Big Bash League

Pietersen was top scorer and has said he would answer a call to play for England at next year's World Cup

Pietersen made a rapid 66 for Melbourne Stars in the opening match of the Big Bash League, showing the 34-year-old can still be a formidable performer.

Whether or not Pietersen's name comes up at all, it seems certain he will not be included in England's 16-man squad for the Tri-series in Australia next month, which also features the home side and India.

That squad must be trimmed to 15 players for the World Cup, with the key issue facing the selectors being whether to retain Alastair Cook as captain.

Alastair Cook faces increased speculation around his future as England one-day captain due to poor form

Cook is taking nothing for granted as the selectors consider all aspects of England's 5-2 defeat in Sri Lanka as part of their scheduled series review, before making the announcement of their touring squad on Saturday morning.

The England captain, who is struggling with his batting, has conceded he has no 'divine right' to be selected to lead the team to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year.

However ECB managing director Paul Downton has hinted strongly that Cook, who turns 30 on Christmas Day, is highly likely to retain leadership responsibilities.
