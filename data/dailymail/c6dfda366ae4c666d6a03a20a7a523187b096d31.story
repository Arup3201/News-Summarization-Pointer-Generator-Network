The Earl of Cardigan could be set to lose the ancestral home which has been in the family for nearly 200 years.

Trustees of the estate are looking to sell Tottenham House, a 100-room mansion in the 4,500-acre Savernake Estate in Wiltshire, it has been reported.

The Earl, who lives in a different house on the estate, is living on £71 a week Jobseekers' Allowance and became a father again last week following the birth of his baby daughter.

The Earl of Cardigan could be set to lose his ancestral home as the trustees of the Savernake Estate look to sell Tottenham House

The dilapidated Tottenham House is the main property on the 4,500-acre Savernake Estate in Wiltshire

According to a report in The Times, property tycoon Jamie Ritblat is in discussions with the trustees to buy the Grade 1-listed, 19th Century Palladian mansion.

It is believed however the final sale may not go ahead or may be held up by litigation.

The Earl, 60, meanwhile, who is taking legal action to remove the trustees from the estate, has vowed to fight any sale of the house.

He said today: 'I am in a London meeting all day, doing everything necessary to block that sale arranged by two men who have taken over half a million from my estate without my permission.

'My claim in the High Court against these two trustees is that they have taken over £500,000 from my Estate without my consent.'

The Earl went on to say: 'That matter needs to get sorted first, 
and then I can turn my hand to finding another hotelier who wants to 
make Tottenham House a very elegant hotel that befits the building.'

The Earl, the heir apparent to the Marquessate of Ailesbury, has been engaged in a vicious legal battle with the two trustees of the estate.

When he 
moved to America to live for four years, the Earl appointed the trustees
 – John Moore, a barrister’s clerk, and Wilson Cotton, an accountant – 
to help him manage Savernake.

But he has accused them of refusing to give him access to his own money.

The trustees, one of whom was a friend of the Earl, have also made 14 criminal allegations against him, ranging from damaging pheasant feeders to spitting at them, although none of the charges resulted in a conviction.

In August the Earl, whose name is David Brudenell-Bruce, said he was 'absolutely thrilled' at the prospect of becoming a father again in November with his second wife Joanne.

The Earl, who is estranged from his daughter Bo Bruce, who starred on The Voice, was first married to Rosamund Jane in 1980, but she asked for a divorce in 2005.

The Earl left the UK for America and appointed the two trustees of the estate.

But when he returned they refused to give up control of the estate, leading him to take legal action which will culminate in December.

Savernake Estate trustee John Moore refused to comment on anything to do with the sale of Tottenham House today.

The barrister's clerk said: 'I cannot comment on things which are connected with the Trust affairs, because I am a trustee. That is the legal position of all trustees.

'When something is happening that doesn't meet with the approval of some people, or, in this case, one person involved we are not allowed by law to comment.'
