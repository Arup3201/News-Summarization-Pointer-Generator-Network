Giant caverns have been excavated under New York as work continues on the monumental Second Avenue Subway project.

The stunning images released by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority show the scale of the task as concrete is mined and blasted up to 27 meters below ground.

The giant underground caves will one day be the city's 86th Street Station - one of the three being built in the $4.45billion project.

Construction workers have carved out huge caverns below New York as they make room for the Second Avenue Subway's future 86th Street Station

Large diggers appear tiny in the enormous caves that have been dug as part of the project, which has been in the pipeline for decades

Construction workers are excavating between 15 and 27 meters underground and work continues for up to 24 hours a day

Once complete, the Second Avenue Subway project will 
include a two-track line along Second Avenue from 125th Street to the 
Financial District in Lower Manhattan.

Over two miles of tunnels are being built across the city as planners aim to reduce connection on New York's transport network.

The 86th Street Station is being mined, which is an added challenge because of the number of high-value properties at street level.

Construction work continues up to 24 hours a day, with the majority of New Yorkers unaware of the mammoth feat carrying on underground.

Phase 1 of the project is scheduled for completion in December 2016. It will include the new 86th Street Station and new stations on 96th and 72nd Streets and new entrances to the existing Lexington Avenue station.

Construction workers have bored tunnels underground that will eventually stretch from 92nd Street to 63rd Street

Phase one of the Second Avenue Subway is due for completion in December 2016 and include a connection to the existing 63rd Street subway

Architects and construction workers are also building new ADA-accessible stations at 96th Street, 86th Street and 72nd Street

The $4.45billion subway will reduce overcrowding and delays on the Lexington Avenue line and aims to improve travel for city and suburban commuters

The first of four construction phases sees the excavation of the tunnels from 105th Street to 63th Street and Third Avenue, with new stations along Second Avenue

The final design for Phase One of the 
project began in April 2006 and the construction contract was first 
awarded in March the following year

Planners predict an extra 200,000 people will be transported on the system when it is finished.

Authorities say travel times and conditions for city and suburban commuters will be improved by the new lines.Â 

Travel from the Upper East Side is expected to be ten minutes faster and divert 23,500 riders a day from the overcrowded Lexington Avenue Line.

The monumental construction project will expand New York transport system, which is already the nation's biggest mass transit system carrying 5million passengers a day

Construction methods across the project vary because of different conditions and range from tunnel boring machinery to mined drill and blast

The final design for Phase One of the project began in April 2006 and the construction contract was first awarded in March the following year

Work on the stations and new subway is going on between 15 and 27 meters below the bustling roads of Manhattan

New Yorkers are mostly unaware of the heavy duty work going on beneath their feet day and night

The expansion of the network was originally proposed in the 1920s but was shelved due to the Great Depression and World War II.

Several stretches of tunnels with tracks were built in the 1970s but once more was put on hold because of a lack of funds.

The existing tunnels are now being incorporated into the new ones.

The New York transport system is already the biggest in the U.S., carrying 5million passengers a day.
