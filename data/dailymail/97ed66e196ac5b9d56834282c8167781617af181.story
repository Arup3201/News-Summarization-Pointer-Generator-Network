A mother came within seconds of aborting her healthy baby after being wrongly told the foetus had died.

Hazel Wiggins almost took an abortion pill after being told her baby had died 11 weeks into the pregnancy - and that it would have to be terminated as a result.

But today, she is the proud mother of a little girl called Amelia who is thriving.

Hazel Wiggins was told to abort Amelia because medics believed she had died 11 weeks into the pregnancy

The events unfolded in August 2013 at Northumberland’s Hexham General Hospital when Ms Wiggins, 36, was 11 weeks into her pregnancy and had an unexpected and heavy bleed.

The mother, from Prudhoe, Northumberland, was told her baby had died but refused give up hope.

She refused to go ahead with the abortion and instead demanded a second scan.

To her amazement, it revealed the baby was alive.

Amelia, dubbed a ‘proper little fighter’, was born on January 13, at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary.

The community care worker said the first scan she had took place because midwives feared she had had a miscarriage.

Mrs Wiggins went to Hexham General Hospital after having a bleed and medics said the baby had no heartbeat. She refused to take the abortion drugs and insisted on another scan which showed Amelia was alive

She said: ‘The midwife looked at my scan for 30 seconds and then said “I’m sorry, there is no heartbeat,” and turned the machine off.

‘I said “Are you sure? You didn’t look at my stomach for very long,” and she said, “Yes, I’m 100 per cent sure”.’

She added: ‘It is the most heart-breaking thing someone can say to you.

‘I went home and just got into bed and mourned the death of the baby.

Amelia was born in January with her liver and bowel outside her body but she is improving rapidly in hospital

‘I let friends and family know. I cried the whole day and night.’

Days later, Mrs Wiggins was back at the hospital to start the first of a series of abortion pills, but deep down she could not accept her baby was dead.

‘They kept saying that I needed to take the tablets and I said that I didn’t want to,’ she said.

‘I told them I wanted another scan. It went on for about 20 minutes.’

Eventually, she persuaded midwives to carry out another scan.

‘I was telling the lady who was scanning me about what had happened when she stopped and looked at me, shocked,” said Mrs Wiggins.

‘She said, “I have a baby here who is jumping all over the place, the baby is alive”.’

The medic then turned the screen to Mrs Wiggins, who is also mother to 10-year-old Dylan.

She said: ‘Amelia looked like she was saying to me “Mum, please don’t take the tablets, I’m alive”.’

When an unborn baby has died, the pregnancy tissue is sometimes expelled from the mother's body naturally.

If this does not happen, the woman will have to take abortion drugs to encourage the body to remove the dead foetus and the pregnancy tissue.

Northumbria NHS Healthcare Foundation Trust has apologised unreservedly for the distress caused to Mrs Wiggins.

The case has led to a change in NHS policy on pre-natal scans.

The hospital has apologised and changed it's procedure so that all women are offered two scans before being told to abort a foetus that is believed to have died

Now, all expectant mothers who have a
 scan which shows their baby has died will be automatically offered a 
second scan to make absolutely sure.

Mrs
 Wiggins, who sought the help of solicitors at Beecham Peacock in 
Newcastle to launch a compensation claim against the trust, is relieved 
other mothers will not have to endure the same ordeal.

When a woman has a miscarriage the pregnancy tissue, including the foetus, is sometimes expelled from her body naturally.

If this happens, she will not require treatment.

However, if they baby dies but the mother's body does not expel it naturally, she may need treatment.

Sometimes a woman can be monitored for about a week in the hope the process will happen naturally.

Alternatively, she can be given medication to encourage the cervix to open to allow the tissue to pass out.

If the medication is unsuccessful, or there is evidence the pregnancy tissue has become infected, the woman may need surgery to remove it.

Amelia
 was born with her liver and bowel on the outside of her body and with 
respiratory problems but her health is improving every day.

The trust accepted liability for causing distress to the couple and the matter was settled out of court.

Dr Eliot Sykes, clinical director of emergency surgery and elective care at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We have recently met with Mrs Wiggins and her husband to apologise wholeheartedly for the unnecessary distress caused following the misinterpretation of her initial scan with us at Hexham General Hospital last year.

‘We have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding this unusual incident and made some important changes to ensure that two scans are always carried out as a matter of course whenever there are concerns about the viability of the foetus.

‘We appreciate this must have been a very worrying time and would like to reassure them that we have taken all appropriate steps to prevent this happening in future.’

Kirsten Scott, senior partner at Beecham Peacock, said: ‘When Hazel was told her baby had died she was understandably devastated. Thanks to her determination and resilience, she saved Amelia’s life.

‘The fact that the policy has now been changed is fantastic news for expectant parents around the country.’
