Sir Alex Ferguson has rubbished claims that he exerted too much influence at Manchester United after his retirement but admits he spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their futures. 

The 72-year-old spent 26-and-a-half years at Old Trafford before retiring in 2013 and insists he kept a 'respectful' distance during successor David Moyes' ultimately doomed reign.

Ferguson says his former players did not come to him to complain as United's season unravelled but says Ferdinand and Evra sought him out for advice.

'Did players come to see me to complain?' Ferguson writes in his updated book, My Autobiography, published on Thursday but leaked on Tuesday. 'Did they hell. Utter nonsense.'

He goes on to write that Ferdinand did 'ask my advice on his future' and that he had a similar chat with Evra.  

Ferdinand left United in the summer when the club decided not to offer him a new contract after his old deal expired, while Evra was sold to Juventus for £1.5million after the £31m purchase of Luke Shaw.

Both players were stalwarts of Ferguson's later teams.

The Scot also dismisses claims that he exerted too much influence at United even after his retirement. He says he never went into the dressing rooms and considering the training ground Carrington 'out of bounds'.

Some have said his presence at games and at the club, where he still kept an office, made it harder for Moyes, but Ferguson hits back saying: '(Moyes) was glad to see me there (at games).'

A measure of Ferguson's dwindling influence at United can be seen in his claim that he knew nothing of Moyes' sacking. 

'I was in Aberdeen as the events unfolded,' he writes. 'On the Monday, I was flying back to Manchester and sitting next to me was a lad with a newspaper that ran: "David Moyes to be sacked"'.

He then spoke to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward when he returned home and established 'a final decision had already been made'. He also says he had no influence regarding the appointment of Louis van Gaal.
