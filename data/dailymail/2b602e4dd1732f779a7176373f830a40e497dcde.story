The Mexican government began airlifting the first of thousands of stranded tourists out of the hurricane and looting-ravaged celebrity-frequented beach town of Los Cabos on Tuesday, as residents picked up the pieces of shattered, flooded homes.

The Interior Ministry said military and commercial planes were carrying travelers out through the Los Cabos international airport, which remained closed to commercial flights due to damage suffered when Hurricane Odile tore through the area late Sunday and Monday.

Images on Mexican television showed the terminal full of debris, but Ministry official Jose Maria Tapia told Milenio Television earlier that the runway was usable and work was nearly complete to make the control tower operable.

Travelers were being flown free of charge to airports in Tijuana, Mazatlan, Guadalajara and Mexico City to catch connecting flights and, in the case of foreigners, receive consular assistance.

Fleeing paradise: Tourists board a plane at the airport of San Jose del Cabo, on Tuesday after hurricane Odile -- which has since been downgraded to a tropical storm -- knocked down trees and power lines in Mexico's Baja California peninsula

Free of charge: Travelers were being flown free of charge to airports in Tijuana, Mazatlan, Guadalajara and Mexico City to catch connecting flights and, in the case of foreigners, receive consular assistance

Priorities: President Enrique Pena Nieto was scheduled to tour the area later in the day and oversee evacuations, after presiding over an independence day military parade in the capital

A boat was on its way to Baja California Sur with humanitarian aid, and authorities were working to restore electricity and phone service.

President Enrique Pena Nieto was scheduled to tour the area later in the day and oversee evacuations, after presiding over an independence day military parade in the capital.

Downgraded to a tropical storm, Odile continued to soak parts of the Baja California Peninsula, and forecasters said it was still capable of unleashing dangerous flash floods and mudslides.

In Los Cabos, Enrique Cota wept as he stood in murky, ankle-deep water and surveyed the destruction at his home. On the kitchen wall, a muddy mark nearly waist-high showed how deep the floodwaters got.

'We'll have to start over, little by little,' Cota said, 'because the stove, the refrigerator, the television, the kid's computer — it's all ruined.'

He rode out Odile's landfall in a shelter with firefighters, and said he hadn't slept for two days.

Dreams into nightmares: Authorities said about 30,000 tourists, 26,000 of them foreigners, were being put up in temporary refuges or hotel areas converted to shelters

Close to disaster: Thousands of others were evacuated from areas at risk of flooding as the NHC said rainfall in some areas could reach as much as 18 inches through Friday

Destruction: Tourists sit on the concrete stairs in the service area of a resort  after the designated area for shelter was destroyed by winds  in Los Cabos, Mexico,  Monday

Luis Felipe Puente, national coordinator for Civil Protection, said the airlift would prioritize the elderly and people with health problems.

For some, it was a dream vacation turned nightmare.

Charly Park, 52, flew in from Los Angeles with his wife on Sunday, but they never even got to check into their room. Instead, they were put directly into the hotel shelter where they spent a hot, cramped night as the hurricane raged outside.

Tourists in shelters or hiding in bathtubs in their rooms posted photos overnight on social media showing windows barricaded with furniture after they were blown out. 

'It's a horrible experience, no air conditioning, no fans ... the power lines all fell down,' Park said.

He was considering renting a car to drive to Tijuana, a little over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) to the north, and cross the border back into California.

Emergency officials in Baja California reported that 135 people were treated for minor injuries from flying glass or falling objects.

Terrifying: Pharmacies, electronics shops and convenience stores were among businesses hit by looters before police restored order on streets strewn with shattered glass from broken windows

But surprisingly for a hurricane of this intensity — it made landfall as a monster Category 3 storm — there were no reports so far of fatalities directly related to Odile.

Odile tore down scores of electricity towers, water tanks, air conditioning units and smashed storefronts across Cabo San Lucas, sparking looting.

Pharmacies, electronics shops and convenience stores were among businesses hit by looters before police restored order on streets strewn with shattered glass from broken windows, said local shop worker Cristina Osuna, 31. 

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said that by Tuesday afternoon Tropical Storm Odile had maximum sustained winds near 50 mph (85 kph). It was centered about 15 miles (25 kilometers) southeast of Bahia de Los Angeles, Mexico, and was moving to the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 kph).

Farther south in the Pacific, Tropical Storm Polo formed off southern Mexico early Tuesday. It was centered 275 miles (440 kilometers) south of Acapulco with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), and was moving northwest parallel to the coast at 12 mph (19 kph). The hurricane center predicted that Polo could become a hurricane later in the week.

Meanwhile in the central Atlantic, Hurricane Edouard strengthened to a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds near 115 mph (185 kph). It was forecast to pose no threat to land.

Not so inviting: Many beaches in Mexico were packed with tourists during the weekend ahead of Tuesday's Independence Day holiday, but the resorts of Los Cabos are in low season and mostly visited by Americans

On a good day: Cabo, as those who frequent the posh beach town in Baja call it, is usually a vacation spot this time of year but unusually strong Pacific hurricane have turned paradise into HELL
