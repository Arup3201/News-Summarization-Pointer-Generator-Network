Suspended thousands of feet above the city below, this bridge would probably not be the most popular of places for those with a fear of heights.

Yet something is not quite right about the city which lies underneath the feet of those walking across the structure - as none of the boats in the harbour move and the skyscrapers show no activity of life, you could almost be forgiven for thinking you were looking at a picture.

But that's because this vertigo-inducing scene was in fact created by French artist Francois Abelanet.

The artist created the amazing 3D street art for an event showcasing the new range of Renault Trucks in Lyon.

The work, measuring more than 4,000 square metres, was also an attempt to enter the Guinness Book of Records for the largest street artwork.

The spectacular images show a range of surreal worlds featuring parcels with wings and bridges high above huge cityscapes, which viewers seem to almost be able to step into.

The people of Lyon were invited to preview the Renault Trucks's new products at the special event.

Visitors were also able to get on board some of the new trucks.

Renault Trucks has been situated in the city of Lyon since 1894, according to france3.fr.

Originally part of Renault, the manufacturer has been owned by the Volvo Group since 2001.

The manufacturer, which unveiled its 
new range of vehicles last month, has been developing the vehicles for 
the past seven years.

The company says it 'has deployed 
significant resources in order to offer its customers vehicles with a 
high level of reliability'.
