Guilty: Kirk Thompson, 46, pictured today, has been convicted of the manslaughter of David Kochs, 43, during a drug-fuelled sado-masochistic sex session at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle

A former government vet has been convicted of killing a man during an extreme drug-fuelled sadomasochistic sex session.

Kirk Thompson, 46, caused severe internal injuries to David Kochs, 43, during the episode at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle, after the pair met on the internet.

He then covered his body with a duvet, before having sex with another man. Police found Mr Kochs dead in flat following day.

Thompson pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter and actual bodily harm but was today found guilty by a jury.

Newcastle Crown Court heard both men had been taking the drug crystal meth when they engaged in the violent episode at Thompson's flat in the city's Jesmond area in March last year.

The jury was told that the defendant 'enjoyed inflicting pain on others' and that night he boasted on the internet about the kind of activity the two had engaged in.

At some point during the evening, Thompson, a former altar boy, became aware that Mr Kochs was either dead or unconscious, and he covered him with a duvet on the floor of his living room.

He then had sex with another man he invited round and had also met online as the body of Mr Kochs lay in the flat.

The next morning, after the second man had left, Mr Thompson messaged his father and said: 'Can you come down immediately, something tragic has happened, just you not Mum please ASAP.'

On arriving at the flat, his father quickly dialled 999 and paramedics and the police arrived at the scene.

After arresting him, Thompson told police the men had engaged in 'extreme no limits anything goes sex' but he believed Mr Kochs had been asleep and that was why he covered him with the duvet.

The jury found him guilty of the manslaughter charge as well as one of actual bodily harm.

Mr Justice Globe said sentencing would take place tomorrow and told Thompson that a sentence of imprisonment was the only one that he should expect.

Scene: The former vet covered his victim's body with a duvet, before having sex with another man. Police found Mr Koch's body in the flat in Jesmond, Newcastle, pictured, the next day

Appearance: Thompson, pictured arriving at court, met Mr kochs online. The court heard both men took the drug crystal meth before the sex session

'There is only one sentence that can be imposed and it is a custodial sentence,' he said. 'I will be giving consideration to what it should be and I will hear submissions tomorrow morning.'

In other evidence, the court heard Thompson had used the Nazi term 'SS' in internet messages with potential partners as part of 'a silly game'.

He explained how he had contracted HIV in his third year of his veterinary medicine degree at Edinburgh University, when he was around 22, but did not take a test for another 10 years, as there was no cure at the time.

Case: Thompson pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter at Newcastle Crown Court but was found guilty by a jury

In the meantime, he studied in the U.S., graduated from Edinburgh, won a scholarship to Oxford and also worked part-time at a local vets in the city.

He eventually moved to Defra, based in Whitehall, in 2003 and during the 2004-5 bird flu scare said he worked on guidelines on how to deal with the threat.

But he had to leave Whitehall, despite being tipped for the top role of Chief Vet by his boss, he said, and moved back to the North East where his parents lived.

He will be sentenced tomorrow.
