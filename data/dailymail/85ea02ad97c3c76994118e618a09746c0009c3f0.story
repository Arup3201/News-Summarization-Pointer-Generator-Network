She is an unlikely member of the fashion elite, but former call girl Zahia Dehar certainly looked the part as she attended the Atelier Versace show as part of Paris Fashion Week.

Arriving at the Haute Couture Spring / Summer 2014 collection the 21-year-old, who is now a celebrated lingerie designer, wore a low-cut, fitted black dress.

As well as showing off her significant curves, the dress featured a leather panel with an intricate beaded design, which was complemented by Zahia’s gold strappy sandals.

The show was attended by a host of celebrity names including Lady Gaga, who is the face of the spring 2014 Versace campaign, acclaimed fashion photographer Mario Testino, as well as Donatella Versace herself.

Zahia, who admits she takes three hours getting ready for work each morning, has managed to launch a successful design business from a scandalous start.

The former underage call girl hit the headlines when she became embroiled in a sex scandal in France involving three of the country’s best known footballers.

However, rather than being destroyed by the incident, Zahir used her notoriety to launch her own fashion line.

The risqué collection, aimed at ‘helping women who want to have fun with their bodies’ was launched at Paris Couture Week in January 2012 and was greeted with enthusiasm by fashion critics.

Karl Lagerfeld even weighed in, describing the savvy entrepreneur as 'very French courtesan, like Liane de Pougy or the Belle Otéro'.
