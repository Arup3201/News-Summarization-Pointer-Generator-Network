A Massachusetts teenager accused of using a broomstick to rape a freshman student at a sports camp pleaded not guilty in state Superior Court yesterday.

Galileo Mondol, 17, entered the plea to seven charges, including aggravated rape on a person under 16.

The 17-year-old Mondol was allowed to remain free on the $100,000 bail he posted after his district court arraignment, with the same conditions.

Galileo Mondol, 17, is charged with one count of aggravated rape of a child, and six counts of assault

Prosecutors say Mondol was one of three Somerville High School soccer players, in suburban Boston, charged in connection with the alleged assault on Aug. 25 in a cabin at Camp Lenox in Otis.

The school had rented the camp for preseason team-building.

Mondol's lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's proceedings, The Berkshire Eagle reported.

Another defense lawyer previously said evidence against the teen is thin.

The other two students in connection with the incident have not been named but are both 16 years old.

Mondol was not involved at first but joined in, Berkshire Assistant District Attorney Rachel Eramo said in September.

'I want to have a crack at that,' Mondol is reported to have said, according to Eramo.

The three defendants then tried to convince the accusers not to report the attack, she said.

Violent: Mondol and two 16-year-olds attacked the freshman and attempted to rape the others on August 25 in a cabin at Camp Lenox in Otis, a prosecutor said in September

Mondol pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated rape of a child, assault on a child with intent to commit rape, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and witness intimidation in September.

The two 16-year-olds were arraigned in juvenile court on similar charges.

'Even
the other defendants and the victims said my client had nothing to do 
with the incident in question,' William Korman said at the earlier trial, adding that Mondol 
even tried to stop the attack. He called the bail amount outrageous.

The
allegations have shaken the Boston suburb of Somerville, including 
Mayor Joe Curtatone, a volunteer football coach at the camp.

Somerville 
High was holding a team-building retreat at the camp for the soccer and 
football teams. The defendants and accusers all play soccer.

Disturbing: Mondol is taken out of the police station following his arrest in September

On August 25, Mondol and the two minors 
are alleged to have entered the cabin where the boys were sleeping and 
carried out the assault and attempted assaults.

‘We will plead not guilty
because my client is not guilty,’ attorney William Korman said at the 
time of his client Mondol's arrest.

‘He
has absolutely no criminal history. He has never been in trouble 
before. We steadfastly maintain his innocence. His parents support him 
100 per cent.’

A total of 
165 student athletes attended the camp, 62 boy football players, 61 boy 
soccer players and 42 girl soccer players, with eight coaches per team 
as supervisors.

The
school has taken athletes to the camp for the past 15 years, and makes 
them sign no-hazing pledges before taking part in the three-night trip, 
said Mayor Curtatone.
