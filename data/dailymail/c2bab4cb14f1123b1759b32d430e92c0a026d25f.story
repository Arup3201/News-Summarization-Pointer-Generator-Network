A strain of bird flu that scientists thought could not infect people has been discovered in a Taiwanese woman.

The news has sparked fears that such strains could ignite a new global outbreak if scientists don't do more to spot them early on.

The woman, 20, was hospitalized in May with a lung infection but was released after being treated with Tamiflu and antibiotics.

One of her throat swabs was sent to the Taiwan Centres for Disease Control and experts there have identified as the H6N1 bird flu, which has been widely circulating in chickens on the island.

The patient, who was not identified, worked in a deli and had no known connection to live birdsaccording to research published online today in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

Investigators couldn't explain how she was infected but they noted several of her close family and friends also developed flu-like symptoms after spending time with her, though none tested positive for H6N1.

Since the H5N1 bird flu strain first broke out in southern China in 1996, public health officials have been nervously monitoring its progress - so far it has killed more than 600 people, mostly in Asia.

Several other bird flu strains, including H7N9, which was first identified in China in April, have also caused concern but none has so far mutated into a form which can to spread easily among people.

Marion Koopmans, a virologist at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands a commentary accompanying the new report.

She wrote: 'The question again is what would it take for these viruses to evolve into a pandemic strain?'

She also said it was worrying that scientists had no early warning signals that such new bird flus could be a problem until humans fell ill.

Scientists often monitor birds to see which viruses are killing them, in an attempt to guess which flu strains might be troublesome for humans - but neither H6N1 nor H7N9 make birds very sick.

Koopmans called for increased surveillance of animal flu viruses and more research into predicting which viruses might cause a global crisis.

'We can surely do better than to have human beings as sentinels,' she wrote.

Her comments come as two pharmaceuticals 
separately reported encouraging results from human tests of a possible 
vaccine against a different type of bird flu that has been spreading in 
China.

The H7N9 bird flu that has infected at least 137 people and killed at least 45 since last spring and is feared to have pandemic potential.

Scientists from Novavax Inc, in Maryland, USA, say tests on 284 people suggest that after two doses of the vaccine, most made antibodies at a level that usually confers protection.

'They gave a third of the usual dose and yet had antibodies in over 80 percent,' said an expert not connected with the work, Dr. Greg Poland of the Mayo Clinic. 'This is encouraging news. We've struggled to make vaccines quickly enough against novel viruses,' he said.

Their results were published online Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine and just a day later their news was echoed by Swiss-based Novartis who announced early tests on its H7N9 vaccine in 400 people showed 85 percent of them got a protective immune response after two doses.
