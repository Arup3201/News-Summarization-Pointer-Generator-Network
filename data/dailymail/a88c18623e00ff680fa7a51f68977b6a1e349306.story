Cold case: Joanna Parrish was murdered in May 1990, but her killer has never been found

A French rapist suspected of murdering British student Joanna Parrish 23 years ago is set to appear in court tomorrow to face charges that he raped a 15-year-old girl.

The serial sex attacker, who has previously been known only by his initials, was today revealed to be 46-year-old lorry driver Thierry Villetard, who is currently serving a jail sentence in Montpellier.

French investigators consider him a 'serious suspect' in the murder of 20-year-old Joanna, whose killer has never been found.

Villetard, who was 23 at the time of 
Joanna's death and lived near her school in Auxerre, is not yet under 
formal investigation for her murder.

However, after witness accounts named him as the culprit for the killing, judges decided to re-open the murder investigation.

The news was welcomed by Joanna's parents, who last summer feared that the killer of their daughter would never be identified.

Villetard
was named in an appeal court document containing crucial written 
evidence from named witnesses accusing him of involvement in three 
murders, one of which allegedly occurred at the same time Joanna died 
and in the same area where her body was found.

In
2011 a French judge had ruled that there was no case to answer against 
serial killer Michel Fourniret and his ex-wife and accomplice Monique 
Olivier, who were previously  under investigation for Joanna’s murder.

They
were jailed for life for the murders of seven girls in 2008. The 
Parrish investigation was then placed on hold pending new evidence.

When
the case against Fourniret and Olivier was dropped, Joanna’s parents 
Roger Parrish and Pauline Murrell feared that their two decade campaign 
for justice for their daughter, whose naked body was found in a river 
near Auxerre after she had been strangled, had failed.

But
last spring the Paris Appeal court ordered the investigation to be 
resumed when new evidence about Villetard emerged from investigations 
carried out by Auxerre gendarmes.

In February the prosecutor in Auxerre reported that gendarmes had been given a crucial lead by the suspect’s former girlfriend.

The woman revealed that she and Villetard were living in Auxerre in May 1990 when Joanna was killed.

The original suspect in Joanna Parrish's murder was Michel Fourniret, a serial killer known as the 'Beast of Ardennes'.

Fourniret, 70, is serving a life sentence for killing nine women aged between 12 and 22.

He carried out his murders in association with his wife, Monique Olivier, from 1987 to 1990 and again in 2000 to 2001.

The couple met in prison, when she agreed to help him abduct young women if he promised to kill her first husband.

He was arrested in 2003 after trying to kidnap a Belgian girl, and Olivier later revealed his other crimes too.

The pair were convicted and sentenced in 2008.

She told gendarmes that one night her boyfriend returned home with scratches on his face and with a jean bag similar to one that Joanna had been carrying.

She said that she had read about the missing bag in a newspaper article written just after Joanna’s murder.

A second girlfriend of Villetard told police that he had boasted of having been involved in two murders.

One took place in 1990, the year Joanna died. According to the second girlfriend's witness account, the version Villetard gave her was that his victim was suffocated by a pillow and her body concealed in woods near a place called Joigny which is fifteen miles from the place where Joanna Parrish was found.

The Gloucestershire student was strangled after her hands and feet had been bound and her body flung into a river. She had gone to meet a man who had answered her advert for private English lessons.

The second crime Villetard is alleged to have boasted about involved a woman whose naked body was discovered beside a motorway in the south of France in 1997.

Corinne Hermann, a spokesman for the law firm representing the Parrish family, said that the new leads were ‘very interesting’ but stressed that Villetard has not yet been formally charged.

‘At the present time he is in prison,' she said. 'The judge in charge of the investigation will study the new evidence in September and will then decide whether to place him under formal investigation.’

Roger Parrish said after the latest evidence emerged last year: 'All I know is it's a man who is serving a prison sentence for violent sexual crimes, and in the investigations an informant told the police they suspected he was involved in Jo's murder.'
