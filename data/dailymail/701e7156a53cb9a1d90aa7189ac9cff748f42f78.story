These are the shocking pictures of the mess left by travellers who occupied a patch of waste ground over just a single weekend.

The trail of destruction includes ruined portable buildings filled with smashed furniture, broken fences, piles of rubbish and a gate thought to have been forced so the group could get access.

The travellers set up camp over the weekend on a privately owned vacant plot of land in Solihull, West Midlands, and have since been removed by police and bailiffs.  

Trashed: The inside of a temporary building littered with broken furniture left behind by the travellers

What a mess: Portable buildings at the site in Solihuill, West Midlands, were left in a complete state 

Smashed: Rubbish was strewn across the patch of waste ground, which was occupied by nine caravans

The group had promised police to leave the site yesterday but they were still there this morning, before they were moved on this afternoon. 

Their vehicles blocked a vital access road for various industrial units and HGVs were unable to pass.

Discarded rubbish littered the area and other roads in the vicinity. 

A Solihull Council spokesperson said: 'We understand there were around nine caravans on the site which vacated the area earlier today.

'It is private land and BNP Paribas Real Estate market the site on behalf of the owner.' 

Right in the way: Vehicles blocked a vital access road for industrial units and HGVs were unable to pass

Hanging around: The travellers promised to leave the site yesterday but were still there this morning before police moved them on this afternoon
