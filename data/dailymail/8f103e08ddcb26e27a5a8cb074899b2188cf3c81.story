A young woman chef shut in a freezer at a celebrity chef’s restaurant was the 
victim of harmless 'banter', a tribunal heard today.

Chloe
 Maisey, 19, is claiming sexual discrimination by the all-male staff at 
the restaurant owned by celebrity chef Stephen Terry - the best man of 
Gordon Ramsey.

Trainee pastry chef Miss Maisey told an employment tribunal she was 'scared and upset' after being shut in the freezer.

But fellow chef Lorne Hargreaves told the hearing: 'It was in the middle of July and everyone was moaning it was too hot.

'I picked her up and put her on the frozen bread. It was a spontaneous, funny thing to do.

'Everybody is treated the same in the kitchen. It is like a family environment, it is like brother-sister banter.'

Miss
 Maisey, who resigned after three months, has made 21 allegations of 
sexual discrimination at the Hardwick restaurant, regularly named as the 
best in Wales.

Highly acclaimed: The Hardwick  restaurant near Abergavenny, where Ms Maisey claims she was discriminated against

Owner Mr Terry - a regular star of TV cookery shows such as the BBC’s Saturday Kitchen - told the tribunal that some of the incidents never happened and dismissed the others as 'banter'.

He
 said: 'Doing service is very stressful and there is a little bit of 
banter. You are in an environment where people mess about on occasions, 
but the guys are not malicious in any way.

'It is not that she was singled out because of her sex.'

But Mr Terry denied being involved in any of the banter himself. 'I am above that,' he said.

Miss
 Maisey claims she was ogled every day as she changed into her chef’s 
uniform at the restaurant which has no female changing rooms.

Claims: Ms Maisey, pictured at an hearing in Cardiff yesterday, left, said that at one point a male colleague slapped her bottom. Pictured right is Stephen Terry, the owner of the restaurant, who denies the allegations

She also claims she was 'groped' when a male staff member slapped her bottom.

The
 tribunal heard how the vegetarian teenager was tricked into eating beef
 stock by a colleague who told her it was chocolate sauce.

Father-of-three Mr Terry, who trained under Marco Pierre White, did not deny the incident happened.

But he told the tribunal in Cardiff: 'I am a restaurateur, I take vegetarians very seriously.

'She did not tell me she felt violated and she did not seem distressed.'

Mr
 Terry said he was 'shocked to the core' when Miss Maisey’s mother rang 
him to complain about her daughter’s treatment at the restaurant near 
Abergavenny.

'Distraught': Ms Maisey's mother said that her 
daughter (above), who resigned from the position at The Hardwick last 
August, said that on one occasion she was hysterical after returning 
from work

Mr Terry said: 'When I took the phone call I was 
completely shocked at what I was listening to and the three issues 
Chloe’s mum raised with me.

'One of the allegations was that one of the chefs had threatened to kill her - and that nearly knocked me off my feet.

'It was a 12-minute phone conversation and I was blown away by it.

'I
 immediately went to speak to Mr Hargreaves and I took him outside and 
he said: “Chef, that is not what happened” and put it all into context.

'Chloe
 had jokingly told him: “I could karate kick you in the f***ing head” 
and he told her: "Look at the size of me Chloe, I could kill you".'

'It was a joke. Speaking to the guys, and having all it all put into context, I didn’t think there was anything to answer.'

William
 Rees, representing Miss Maisey, told Mr Terry he had failed to 
investigate the allegations formally and took the word of his male 
employees after one conversation.

But Mr Terry said he trusted his senior chefs who had worked for him over a number of years.

Mr
 Terry said: 'I was shocked to the core by the allegations made by 
Chloe’s mum and I told her she needed to put them in writing.

'But 
nothing ever came detailing the allegations in more detail. I am an 
educated man - I have seen a lot and I talked to everyone there and took
 a view on it.'

Miss Maisie accused sous chef Jamie O'Leary of throwing a sea bass at her.

Mr O'Leary, told the tribunal: 'Have you any idea how much sea bass costs?'

'If Stephen Terry caught wind of me throwing a sea bass around the kitchen it would be the end of me.

'I was simply showing her how to prepare a fish and turned the fish head towards her in jest.

'These events have been blown out of all proportion as to what happened.'

Miss Maisey also accused Mr O'Leary of throwing a mouse at her which had come into the restaurant in a box of organic vegetables.

Mr O'Leary said: 'We all had a look at it before I carried it into the car park and released it into the hedgerow.

'I wouldn't be the sous chef at the Hardwick if I was flinging mice around the kitchen. It's ridiculous.'

Mr O'Leary added: 'I spend more time with the team than with my wife and child.

'The Hardwick is my second family, there is going to be banter, not on a daily basis, but at the end of the day the restaurant is not what it's being portrayed as.

'It doesn't get the high reputation it has, based on the amount of horseplay that is alleged to have gone on. No one has ever complained before.'

The tribunal in Cardiff heard there were several female employees Miss Maisey could have talked to about her concerns.

The payroll and HR manager Charlotte Hilling told the tribunal: 'I spoke to Chloe after she joined and told her if there was ever any problem she could come to me.'

The tribunal has heard male kitchen workers ogled Miss Maisey as she changed into her chef's whites at the restaurant near Abergavenny, South Wales.

But Ms Hilling said there was a female employee currently working in the kitchen who used the restaurant's shower cubicle to change.
