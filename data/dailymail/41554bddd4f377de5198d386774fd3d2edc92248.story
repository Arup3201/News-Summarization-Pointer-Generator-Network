Scott Sinclair admits the last 18 months have been among the toughest of his career as he faces up to an uncertain future at Manchester City.

The Premier League champions will offload Sinclair this summer if a buyer can be found, just two years after a £6.2million deadline day move from Swansea.

The 25-year-old winger made just three starts in his first season at the Etihad under Roberto Mancini before a blood clot was discovered in his shoulder in May 2013 which required surgery.

Off the pitch: Sinclair is probably better known for his relationship with actress Helen Flanagan

Sinclair then spent last season on loan 
at West Bromwich Albion but was sidelined by new manager Pepe Mel and 
made only 11 appearances for the club.

In fact, the former England Under-21 forward has become better known for his relationship with Coronation Street actress Helen Flanagan than anything he has produced on the pitch as his career has waned, and Sinclair admits it has been a difficult period of his life.

‘As a player you've got to go through the tough times and the last 18 months have been a very, very tough time for me,’ said Sinclair.

‘You know, going on loan and getting injured and also having my blood clot the previous year, so all I can do is look forward, play what’s in front of me and whenever I get the opportunity I’ve got to produce and get the goals whenever I can. 

The former Chelsea player has started 
both games so far on City’s pre-season tour of the United States and 
scored the second goal in Sunday’s convincing 5-1 win over AC Milan in 
Pittsburgh.

Sinclair, who is set to face Liverpool in Yankee Stadium on Wednesday, believes he is finally getting back to the form that saw him help Swansea into the Premier League in 2011

‘This is probably one of the best pre-seasons I’ve had because I haven’t had the minutes I’m getting now,’ he said. ‘I feel great, you can see it in the performances. I'm scoring goals, I’m getting back to my normal self how I was at Swansea.

‘Pre-season is probably the most important for any footballer to get those games. I feel great and hopefully now I can get more minutes and be ready for the season to see what happens.’
