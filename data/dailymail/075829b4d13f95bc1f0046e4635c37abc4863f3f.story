We can all recall that scene in 1990 rom-com Pretty Woman where Julia Roberts walks into a luxury boutique dressed in her scruffy clothes and the saleswoman says: 'I don’t think we have anything for you here. You’re obviously in the wrong place.'

It now appears the snooty woman behind the till might have hit upon a genius sales tactic - because, according to new research, rude sales assistants can actually make us want to buy more.

According to the study, called 'Should the Devil Sell Prada? Retail Rejection Increases Aspiring Consumers' Desire for the Brand', which will be published in the October issue of the Journal of Consumer Research, staff with an obnoxious attitude makes shoppers want to spend more - as long as it's luxury goods on offer.

Remember that? Just like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, who returns to the store who snubbed her carrying high-end bags after a shopping spree, rude staff can actually make us want to buy more, reveals a new study

The University of British Columbia sought to understand the relationship between rude treatment and desire to purchase something

Professor Darren Dahl, a marketing expert leading the research, carried out a study whereby volunteers were given a scenario.

The participants were told to imagine that they were shopping at either a designer or high street clothes shop. Actors playing sales assistants were told to treat the participants with a welcoming or snooty attitude.

Could it work? A professor behind the study said that snobbiness might actually be a qualification worth considering for luxury brands like Louis Vuitton or Gucci

The results revealed that those participants treated with attitude said it made them want to purchase the designer goods more.

'This only worked for brands and stores that customers would aspire to, truly luxury brands like Burberry or Gucci,' said Professor Darren Dahl.

He added: 'It appears that snobbiness might actually be a qualification worth considering for luxury brands like Louis Vuitton or Gucci.

The staff's snobbishness makes customers feel like they’re back in high school again, where being in with the popular crowd seems all the rage.

'Our research indicates they can end up having a similar effect to an "in-group" in high school that others aspire to join. The desire "to belong"…is a powerful force,' added Professor Dahl.
