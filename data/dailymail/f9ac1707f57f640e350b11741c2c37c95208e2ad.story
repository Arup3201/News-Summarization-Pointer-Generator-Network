Tragic: 35-year-old Neil Gray died in a freak snorkelling accident in Thailand

A British holidaymaker has drowned in a freak accident while snorkelling off a secluded beach in Thailand.

Neil Gray, from Burntisland, 
Fife, was pulled from the sea 
by friends at 8am on Sunday after getting into difficulty off the 
secluded Ao Sane beach on the holiday island of Phuket.

The 35-year-old had been enjoying an extended holiday with his older brother Mark,
40, who runs an online business on the island.

The family are still awaiting official 
confirmation of how he died by local police chiefs believe the group had
been drinking in the hours running up to the incident.

Before jetted out in mid November Mr Gray had written on Facebook: 'Can't wait to hit Thailand again for a couple of months. The countdown is on.'

Mark had to break the devastating news of Neil's death to their mother Pat late on Sunday night after identifying his brother's body.

She paid tribute to the treasured son she said 'just loved life' and revealed he repeatedly cancelled flights to return home from the Far East because he was having such a good time.

Mrs Gray said: 'He just loved life, and was so much fun. He was a loveable nutter, and will be missed by everyone.

'He
loved Thailand - the place and the people. He wanted to stay there 
long-term. The whole family are devastated. He would do anything for 
anyone.'

According to his devastated mother, Mr Gray was having such a good time in Thailand that he had repeatedly cancelled flights to return home

Pat and Neil's younger brother Kris, 29, had only recently returned from visiting her two sons in Thailand for Christmas.

Pat added: 'He is a very experienced snorkeller and did it every day in Thailand, so we don't know what's happened.

Funeral: Mr Gray is to be cremated at a Buddhist temple

'He
had been out with friends the night before, but all police are telling 
us is that it was 'accidental death by drowning'. Once his friends got 
him out the water, he was pronounced dead.'

Neil's traditional Thai cremation will be attended by close family and friends he has made whilst travelling.

Mr GrayÂ  is to be cremated at a Buddhist
temple. His heartbroken mother Pat Gray, 59, flew out to Thailand this morning to
finalise the funeral arrangements.

Online tributes poured in for Neil, who was living in Pembrokeshire, Wales, before he travelled to the Far East.

Cousin Laura Gray wrote: 'R.I.P big cuzin Neil. No 1 can say u didnt live life to the full, so unexpected.'

Michelle Ewen added: 'So very sad. He will have touched the hearts of many.'

Cops last night said they believed booze 'may have contributed' to Neil's death.

Captain Chienchai Duangsuwan, of the Chalong Police, said: 'Mr Gray had no pre-existing medical condition that we know of.

'The group woke early to go swimming and snorkelling. However, we were told he and his friends were up late drinking the previous night, so that may have contributed to his death.'

Phuket, Thailand's biggest island, is one of Far East Asia's most popular holiday islands. Ao Sane, a rocky beach on Phuket's southwest coast, is described as one of the island's 'loveliest secrets'.
