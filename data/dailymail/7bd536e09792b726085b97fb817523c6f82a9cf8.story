Most brides dream of throwing a white wedding which will make other women green with envy.

But one bride has instead painted herself and her husband-to-be green, for their fairy-tale wedding based on the film Shrek.

Amanda, 44, and Nathan Gibbs, 39, from Kingswinford, West Midlands planned their rather unusual ceremony after eight years together.

Green with envy? A couple dressed as Shrek and Princess Fiona for their wedding in Dudley, West Midlands

Happy couple: Newlyweds Nathan and Amanda Gibbs sign the register in full costume

Themed: The couple's guests were also encouraged to dress up for their big day, held at Priory Hall, Dudley

After losing a number of friends to cancer, the couple decided to dress as the fairytale couple and use the day to raise money for charity.

Dressed in full costume, the pair wed this morning at Priory Hall near Dudley.

Guests also dressed up for the themed celebrations - dressing up as the Gingerbread Man, Mickey Mouse and Jack Sparrow from Pirates Of The Caribbean.

Cause: Having lost a number of friends to cancer, the couple decided to have a themed wedding in aid of charity

Instead of wedding gifts, the couple - who run an ironing service business, asked that people donate money to Cancer Research.

Mr Gibbs said: 'In the last 15 months we've lost seven of our customers to cancer.

'It just broke our hearts. We wanted to do something to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage more people to go and get checked out.'

Vows: The couple - pictured just after the ceremony - always joked they would have a 'fairytale wedding'

The former bricklayer said the couple used to joke that if they ever got married, they would have a fairytale wedding.

'It was a standing joke between us. All our friends started getting married and I said "When we do it we'll have a fairytale wedding. I'll be Shrek and you can be Princess Fiona".

'Earlier this year we held a fundraiser for Cancer Research and we were talking about what else we could do when Shrek came on the TV. We turned to each other and laughed.'

Inspiration: The pair decided to make their wedding Shrek-themed when the film came on the television

Fancy dress: Guests came as a selection of characters - including Mr T, pirates and mini mouse

'I do': One guest throws confetti while Snow White, Buzz Lightgear and a Gingerbread man watch on

Plans got under way for the fairytale wedding but the couple were then hit with more bad news.

'My sister Donna was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was such a shock.

'We were trying to do something to help others and then it happened to us.'

In the spirit: One guest came as Donkey from the film while another came as a monk

Family: Nathan's sister was recently diagnosed with breast cancer - but was given the all-clear before the day

Luckily his sister has been given the all-clear but it made the couple even more determined to raise awareness of the disease.

Mr Gibbs said: 'We've had a great day today and it's fantastic to think the money raised will go towards helping to support those with cancer and their families.

'Also, if this story encourages just one person who has found a lump to go and get checked out then we will have succeeded.'
