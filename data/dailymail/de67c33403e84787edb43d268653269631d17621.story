A Los Angeles restaurant is charging $50 for the country's first water tasting class lead by a certified water sommelier. 

Water 101 is being hosted at Patina by the restaurant's resident aqua expert Martin Riese - who will teach customers about the 'fundamentals of water' during the hour long lesson.

'Water is essential to life. But not all waters are the same,' he explained on the class brochure. 'Water has a significant impact on the way we taste food... and can be paired in a manner similar to wine.'

The price of admission also includes five 'dramatically different' waters and small bites from Patina's signature artisanal cheese selection.

The first class in the series takes place on February 4 with others being held at Patina on April 1 and June 3. 

The flyer ensures future water connoisseurs that the groups will remain small so customers will get the most out of their tasting. 

Mr Rise, who is also general manager of the Patina Restaurant Group's dining establishment Ray's and Stark Bar, was the man behind the establishment's 45 page water menu, which features 20 varieties of water from around the world.

Before he started working for the Patina Restaurant Group in 2011, the H2O expert had written a 200-page book on the topic, titled Die Welt des Wassers or The World of Water. 

He had acquired his water sommelier certification in 2010 after completing a $3,000 week-long course at Doemen's, in his native Germany.

'A lot of Americans think water is just water,' he told the Los Angeles Times in 2013. 'But I completely don't believe in that. Water has so many interesting nuances.'  

He noted: 'Every water has an unique taste, even tap water.'

'Different mineral content of each water gives the waters a different tastes,' Mr Riese explained. 'It can go from sweet to salty and smooth to complex.'

The expert even has his own brand of water. Beverly Hills 90H20 is sold at Ray's and Stark Bar for $13 per bottle, although it is not clear whether or not it will be served at Mr Riese's upcoming tasting lessons. 

Mr Riese said the base of his water comes from a mineral water spring from the Sierra Nevada Mountains, noting that it took him and his partner Jon Gluck over a year to come up with the 'perfect natural mineral mix' to add.

'We’ve even patented our water formulation and bottle shape,' he said. 'Every blend is limited to a 10,000 bottle run.'
