The Double robot that can let you virtually attend meeting anywhere in the world, and even let you visit art galleries.

It can move around, all controlled by your own iPad, and even adjust its height to make sure you are always at eye level.

The firm says the gadget could be used to attend meetings, meet friends for lunch, and even visit art galleries around the world.

'You can stay at eye level, whether sitting or standing, by adjusting your height remotely, which makes conversations fluid and real,' says the firm behind it.

The robot is based around a single wheel, which balances the robot as it moves, rather like a Segway.

Where you're not moving, a retractable kickstand automatically deploys to conserve power when you are not moving around.

Double Robotics, the firm behind the design, says 'Efficient motors and lightweight design give Double the ability to last all day without recharging the battery.'

Where you're not moving, a retractable kickstand automatically deploys to conserve power when you are not moving around.

The gadget has already proved a huge success, the firm said, with the first run already sold out.

The robot could even be sent into art galleries without ever having to visit them, with rented robots being used to give hundreds access to collections around the world.

'First off, we want to thank you all for your enthusiasm and support for Double, especially to those of you who pre-ordered,' it said in a blog post.

'Because of the overwhelming response, we've already had to expand our first production run to include more robots than planned, which is great!Â 

'However, in good conscience, we cannot continue to offer a December ship date for units placed from here forward.

'New orders placed (as of August 16th) will now be shipping in early 2013.'

The double robot can adjust its height between a sitting and standing mode to ensure you are at eye level with others.
