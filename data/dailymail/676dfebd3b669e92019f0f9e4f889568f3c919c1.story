Roller girl: Stacey Blitsch is fighting for the right to share information about ex boyfriends

When they felt betrayed by their former lover, two women allegedly went online to warn other women to stay well away.

And while the posts have led to them being dragged into court, sued for defamation, the angry women are still not holding back - now fighting for the 'free speech' to let the world know how they were treated.

Former 'roller jam' television star Stacey Blitsch and Amanda Ryncarz defended their actions yesterday, backed by a celebrity lawyer.

Attorney Matthew Couloutte Jr. claims the two women posted defamatory insults about him on a website.

One anonymous post claimed: 'Our relationship didn't last long, as I figured him out pretty quickly, but for others, BE FOREWARNED, HE'S SCUM! RUN FAR AWAY!'

Miss Blitsch, who has a son with the lawyer, claims she did not write any posts, while Miss Ryncarz argues her comments were truthful and should be covered by free speech.

'I do beliecve that women should have a legal right to share information with each other, if they feel they have been betrayed in a relationship,' she said.

Celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred took the opportunity yesterday to back the two. launching a stinging attack on men, claiming they are more likely to cheat in relationships than women.

Allred spoke in New York City and 
slammed a law that prevents people from suing their ex-lovers for 
breaking a promise to tie the knot.

She
was announcing the defence of the two clients who were sued by the same
ex-boyfriend for allegedly defaming him on a gossip website.

'We believe that men are more likely to lie and cheat in their relationships with women than vice-versa,’ the famous lawyer said in a TMZ video.

'We all know who is generally the victim of a lie or cheating - (although) not always, there are women who cheat.

'Often the men in a relationship have more money, they have more power (and) they have more resources of every kind.’

Ms Allred claims the ‘Heart Balm’ laws may be gender-neutral, but have an ‘adverse impact' on women because men are more likely to cheat.

Online posts: One woman Ms Allred is defending is Amanda Ryncarz, 26, who allegedly defamed her ex-lover Matthew Couloute - who is also a lawyer

Putting up a fight: Lawyer Matthew Couloute is suing former roller derby star Stacey Blitsch, 35, who is the mother of his young son

One woman she is defending is Amanda Ryncarz, 26, who allegedly defamed her ex-lover Matthew Couloute - who is also a lawyer.

‘I posted on Liarscheatersrus.com because I wanted to warn other women in order to protect them from what I suffered,’ Ms Ryncarz said.

A post on the website read: ‘He is very, very manipulating, he's an attorney so he's great at lying and covering it up without batting an eye'

Unhappy: Mr Couloute's lawyer Louis Zayas said the two women have no right to defame his client or interfere with his 'ability to make a living'

Mr Couloute is also suing another lover - former roller derby star Stacey Blitsch, 35, who is the mother of his young son, reported WABC.

‘I am here because I want people to know the truth and I am asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit filed against me,’ Ms Blitsch said.

But Mr Couloute's lawyer Louis Zayas said the two women both have no right to defame his client or interfere with his ‘ability to make a living’.

Mr Couloute's lawsuit claims the online post is false and has severely impacted his ability to maintain and secure clients, reported WABC.
