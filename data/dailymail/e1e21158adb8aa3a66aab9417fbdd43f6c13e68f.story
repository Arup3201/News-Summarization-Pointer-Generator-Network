A screening of hit-film Fifty Shades of Grey turned ugly when two gangs of women clashed in the cinema aisles. 

The screaming match took place at Barnsley's Parkway cinema during the Valentine's Day showing of E.L. James' raunchy blockbuster. 

The row became so heated it drowned out the closing soundtrack of the movie - which meant many disgruntled cinema-goers missed the climax.

One said: 'There was a group of women, I won't call them ladies, who were talking loudly and laughing all the way through the film. 

'Someone asked them to be quiet but things turned nasty and they just got louder. 

'I couldn't hear any of the dialogue. I had been looking forward to seeing the film for weeks and then I completely missed the end because of those stupid idiots.'

Another said: 'Things got a bit heated and people were arguing and telling them to be quiet, it just spoiled the whole night. 

'These were middle-aged women who were just idiots and who didn't know how to behave in a cinema.' 

Cinema owner Rob Younger said: 'I have been in the business for a long but I have never seen anything like this before.

'Quite clearly these people didn't know how to behave in a cinema even though they were of an age where you think they would.

'We were really shocked by the behaviour of a handful of people and they have now been banned from the building.

'We were aware of all the hype about the film and I must admit I expected the audience to get a be excited at the first showing because there has been a lot of publicity over the film.

'But you don't expect women of a certain age to behave in this way. When we have films which are aimed at small children we expect them to get a bit giddy, excited and loud.

'We gently try to calm them down and tell them they can't talk over the film like they might do at home if they were watching television.

'You wouldn't think you would have to do that with so-called adults. We spoke to them but it didn't seem to make any difference.'

Police were called to the Grosvenor Cinema in Glasgow's Ashton Lane (pictured) on Saturday after witnesses said a group of women had got drunk before attacking a man who asked them to be quiet

On the same night, police arrested three women at a screening of the film in Glasgow after reports a man was glassed. 

Officers were called to the city's Grosvenor cinema after reports a group of 'drunk and rowdy' women had turned violent. 

Witnesses said movie-goers were vomiting in the aisles of the cinema - where alcoholic drinks are served - before the alleged attack.

It is reported a man asked the group to keep the noise down when he was attacked  by one of the women. 

Witnesses said cinema staff were left cleaning up blood from the cinema floor after the incident. 

On Wednesday, police were called to the Century Cinema in Clacton-on-Sea, in Essex, after a similar incident. 

Police arrested a 22-year-old  on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly and for assault.

Adam Cunard, the cinema's managing director, said: 'It was very unfortunate for this to happen.

'Most people understood and we have given refunds and extra tickets to future performances.'
