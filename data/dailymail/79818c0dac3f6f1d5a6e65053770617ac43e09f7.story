Manny Pacquiao is confident his long-awaited mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr will be announced by the end of the month.

The fight, which would be worth at least $300million (£197million), is expected to be held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas with a preferred date of May 2.

Pacquiao has consistently called out Mayweather since his lop-sided win over Chris Algieri last November.

Manny Pacquiao believes his long-awaited fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr will be announced before February 

And he told the Manilla Standard: 'We will make an announcement before the end if the month. I think it will happen.'

Mayweather wants to fight on May 2, the Saturday closest to the Cinco de Mayo holiday, as has been his tradition in recent years.

But that date has also been earmarked for Miguel Cotto's proposed clash with Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez which would be one of the biggest fights in the history of the Puerto Rico-Mexico rivalry.

Mayweather said last month: 'The public want this fight. I want it. the only stumbling block has been Bob Arum (Pacquiao's promoter) but I think both fighters want it. So it's time to get it on. I'm not ducking anyone, so let's get this on.

'Years ago we had problems with random blood and urine testing. I just want to have an even playing field.

'Now he's in a very, very tight situation with his loss to (Juan Manuel) Marquez and his loss to (Timothy) Bradley. His pay-per-view numbers are extremely low, so he's desperate. I wanted that fight a long time ago.'

Reports in America over the weekend suggested the venue had been agreed, as well as a drug testing programme.

The final stumbling block appears to be the purse split with Mayweather refusing to agree to a 50/50 division.

But Pacquiao has long been adamant that he would accept the smaller portion in order to end more than five years of debate since the fight was first mooted.

Before Christmas he told Sky Sports: 'Mayweather can get the amount he wants. I challenged him to a charity fight. Until now, he has not agreed to it. 'So, money is not the issue in our fight. This fight is about legacy, this is about making the fans happy and, above all, this is for the good of boxing.

'He has reached a dead end. He has nowhere to run but to fight me. I will try my best to make this a thrilling and entertaining fight. But I doubt if he's gonna engage me in a slugfest. You all know his fighting style. Most of his previous fights, if not all, induced us to sleep.

'I know what I have to do. I will chase him wherever he goes just in case he decides to run around the ring. We will devise a good fight plan against him.'
