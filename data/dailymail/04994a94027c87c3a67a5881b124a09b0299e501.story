A 130-year-old prison has been converted into a quirky hostel, where travellers can experience a night in the cells.

The former military prison, dating back to 1883, is located in Ljubljana, Slovenia and has been converted into a youth hostel, offering a bed for travellers from all around the world.

There are 20 cells which guests can stay in and each is completely unique in its design, except they all have their original cell bars on the doors and windows, meaning guests can star in their very own 'prison break.'

The hostel, called Hostel Celica, was established in 2003 by the Student Organisation of Ljubljana

Despite the makeover, there is still somewhat of an eerie feel to the prison-turned-hostel in Slovenia

The dining area is totally unrecognisable to the grim conditions prisoners would have suffered back in the day

In addition to the cells there are eight rooms which travellers can stay in, plus a disabled room, and rates start from just £25 a night in a shared room.

The hostel, called Hostel Celica, was established in 2003 by the Student Organisation of Ljubljana and has been designed to be bright and quirky- a world away from the prison's former grey decor.

Despite its history, the former prison is bright and airy, welcoming guests and inquisitive vistors

The dining area is a good place to make new friends, and left, the hostel has kept many of the existing bars to the cells

You might be able to relax more than you ever thought you would be inside a prison cell, but you might hope a curtain covers the door

The jailhouse was originally used as a military prison of the Austro-Hungarian army but the barracks were demilitarized in 1991 when Slovenia gained independence.

The historic building took two years to convert into the hostel it is today, which boasts its own art gallery for travellers to browse.

Local and international musicians regularly play gigs in the hostel's bar and restaurant and guests can even enjoy a free, daily guided tour of the local area.

And how the new hostel looks today - taking on a modern look with many windows so as to maximise natural light

Although the size and decor isn't greatly appealing, considering it is a hostel with history, travellers will be attracted

Quirky art has been added to the rooms in the hostel - but have they been extended from original prisoners' etchings?

And it's not just travellers seeking a night in the cells who rate the building- Celica was once even voted the number one hippest hostel in the world by travel guide Lonely Planet.

Sanja Petrovic, from Hostel Celica, said: 'We are very proud of our unique hostel and its history as a prison and happy to see guest enjoying their time in this historic building.'
