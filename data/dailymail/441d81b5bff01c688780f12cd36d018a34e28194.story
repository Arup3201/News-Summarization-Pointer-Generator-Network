Alan Pardew admits that Jak Alnwick’s wage demands could rocket should he prove himself as a Premier League goalkeeper over the next month.

The 21-year-old is set for an extended run in the Newcastle team and will make his full professional debut at Arsenal.

Alnwick, though, is out of contract in the summer and, with the Magpies having already signed Nottingham Forest stopper Karl Darlow, his future at his hometown club is uncertain.

But with first-choice goalkeepers Tim Krul and Rob Elliot sidelined until January with ankle and thigh injuries respectively, Alnwick will keep goal through the entire festive period.

Should he impress – as he did during the second half of last weekend’s 2-1 win over Chelsea – then contract talks will open in the New Year.

And Pardew says the young custodian could well be in a position of power.

‘I think Jak knows this is a real game changer for him,’ said the United boss, who yesterday collected the Manager of the Month award for November.

‘It can be seven games, roughly, he might have in goal and it’s a great opportunity for him.

‘Who knows? After five or six we might be kicking ourselves that we didn’t give him a contract. It might have been cheaper!

‘But the ball is very much in Jak’s court and that’s where it will stay until such time as the two goalies come back and we make a decision.’

Alnwick had been in the shadows for five years at St James’ Park before his half-time introduction against the Blues.

But Pardew says nothing will faze the younger brother of former Sunderland and Spurs keeper, Ben.

‘Everyone who interviewed him after the game will say he’s a humble guy,’ he said. ‘He’s got no delusions of grandeur but he also believes he’s ready. Although he’s very young to be goalkeeper of Newcastle he’s confident he can do the job and let’s hope he can.’

Another player in a similar situation to Alnwick is Sammy Ameobi. His deal is also up at the end of the season but Pardew believes that has been the motivating factor behind his recent good form.

‘I think Sammy having his contract up at the end of the year is a good thing for him,’ he said.

‘It keeps him hungry. He’s turned the tables a bit for himself. That hunger is sometimes a good hunger - let’s hope he continues on that path.

‘But we take risks all the time with contracts. Sometimes you make those calls because of the personality of the player.’

Newcastle fielded five Geordies – Alnwick, Ameobi, Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett and Jack Colback - against Chelsea, and the club has made a deliberate effort to recruit players from within the North-East rather than from abroad.

And Pardew added: ‘We’ve worked very, very hard to get that (local players) right and we’re getting the rewards now.

‘It’s something we decided to do and we felt that sometimes bringing players from all over the world can disrupt it a little bit. We’ll maybe wait until they’re a little bit older to go and get those guys and keep the other group local and keep the spirit and work ethic here that the area’s renowned for.

‘All those guys that have come through, I’d be surprised if you could find any of those that you didn’t think was a good person or good character. That’s a part of the academy as well, not just producing players but producing people who are of the right character and right manner.’
