A council which has been forced to slash millions from its budget spent £17,000 on an extravagant ceremony to switch on its Christmas lights. 

Crawley Borough Council has been forced to make savings of £7.3million from its budget during the last five years - cutting services for residents.

But the council decided to spare no expense when it hired barriers, bouncers and put up a stage, as well as organised a fireworks display and street entertainment for the switch-on event, which cost £16,882. 

Crawley Council spent £17,000 on an extravagant Christmas lights switch on event, which residents branded a shambles and criticised as the council has slashed millions off its budget in the last five years 

It also drafted in Stephen Mulhern, the presenter, for the event - but residents complained it was a waste of money, with bad decorations and a poor fireworks display.

Steve Burbidge was at the event with his daughter and said: 'All I can say is it was unbelievable.

'My daughter asked me when they were putting the lights on - but they already had.' 

Another resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was a joke - we couldn't see the fireworks and the decorations themselves are dreadful.

'It was a shambles and an embarrassment. Spending £100 on the event would have been too much, let alone £17,000.'

Last year Crawley Borough Council announced it would close 22 playgrounds which were under used and cost too much to maintain. This was reduced to four after a backlash. 

Stephen Mulhern (holding microphone) was drafted in to turn on Crawley's Christmas lights, while the council also spent thousands on a stage, bouncers, barriers and decorations - which residents said were rubbish 

People said they were unable to see the town's expensive fireworks display because of the barriers they used

The council merged community wardens and civil enforcement officers, which it claimed saved £50,000.

The TaxPayers' Alliance also criticised the council for trying to create festive cheer by spending money. 

Andy Silvester said: 'It's easy to sound like the grinch but at a time when we're struggling to pay for social care and children's services, every penny of unnecessary spending has to be questioned.

'It's a small figure in the grand scheme of things, but this money could have been spent better.

'Festive cheer isn't created by Councils, no matter how hard they try.'

A council spokesman described the switch-on as 'a great event' which attracted 2,500 people into the town centre, and added: 'The economic benefit to the town was almost certainly higher and feedback from local organisations, was extremely positive.'
