A vegan mom was reunited with her son on Wednesday after a judge dismissed claims she was an unfit mother because she wanted to feed her son vegan baby formula.

Sarah Markham, from Florida, kissed her son Caleb in court after the judge ruled she could have custody of him provided she meet with a nutritionist.   

He was taken into care in June when, instead of following a doctor's orders, Ms Markham decided to try supplementing her breast milk with a vegan formula after her son lost 10 per cent of his body weight. 

Markham's doctor then reported Sarah to Child Protective Services who arrested Markham for child neglect and they took 12-day-old Caleb away and gave him to Sarah's parents.

Reunited: Sarah Markham regained custody of her child yesterday after he was taken away because she wanted to supplement her breast milk with a soy formula 

Sticks to her beliefs: 'He's still on a soy formula – he's been on it, he likes it, he's doing well. He's growing healthy, and I can't ask for anything more,' Markham said outside the courtroom yesterday 

On Wednesday the judge decided that Markham was not an unfit mother and said she could have him back if she promises to meet with a nutritionist.

Markham agreed to visit a nutritionist but has said her son is still on a soy formula.

'He's still on a soy formula – he's been on it, he likes it, he's doing well. He's growing healthy, and I can't ask for anything more,' Markham said.

“There’s no case, there’s no abuse, there’s no neglect, there’s simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother and he didn’t like it,' Grandfather Bo Markham told WFTV.

Caleb now weighs 17 pounds and has been properly taken care of by his grandparents who believe their daughter is a superb mother.

Wednesday's case was for the sole purpose of regaining custody but Markham  still faces criminal charges that her lawyer is confident a judge will dismiss as well.

'My hope is that they'll simply dismiss it and not go forward on this at all,' O'Mara said.  

No abuse: Caleb's grandfather, who has been caring for the boy when Sarah was unable to, has said there is absolutely no child abuse in this case and that his daughter is a fit mother

Markham was arrested in June when her son was less than two weeks old.  

Markham is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist and holistic healing and a vegan diet is in her system of beliefs.

Because of her choice not to take her son to the hospital, Markham  was only allowed to see her son during supervised visits and only a few times a week, according to Seminole County Child Protective Services.

'They've kept a child away from a mom,' said attorney Mark O'Mara to WFTV.

'My client can only see her child once a week or twice a week because they're requiring the child be out of the county,' he said prior to Markham regaining custody.

O'Mara said that Markham's parenting was 'not even close' to child neglect.

'It's absurd. It's a mom trying to do the best she can, acting as a vegan which she has the entire right to do taking care of her child,' he said.

Markham’s son is now healthy and she is happy to have him home.

'She has done everything they've asked her to do: Mental health evaluations, drug evaluations, parenting classes, everything they've asked her to do she's done, and she's done it very well, and yet we have to go to trial on this tomorrow. It's absurd,' said O'Mara yesterday before winning the custody battle.

Throw out her case: Sarah Markham's lawyer believes that the criminal charges will be thrown out in the smae way the custody battle was in court on Wednesday 

Health problems: Sarah Markham's now healthy baby had lost 10 percent of his body weight and doctors told her to take the baby to the hospital but she tried giving him a vegan baby formula instead 

Following her beliefs:  Markham is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist and holistic healing and a vegan diet, even for her child,  is in her system of beliefs
