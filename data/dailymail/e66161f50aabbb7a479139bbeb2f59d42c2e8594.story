Former England footballer Kenny Sansom has revealed he is homeless and sleeping on a park bench after drinking seven bottles of wine a day and gambling away his fortune.

The full-back's family say they are worried because the 54-year-old has now disappeared and only has £20.

Sansom is an Arsenal legend, who won 86 caps for his country, but is at rock bottom after years of struggling with alcohol.

At his best in the 1980s he was earning £1,200 a week and lived in a £1million mansion. However, he is now penniless and sleeping rough after losing it all.

Kenny is yet another retired footballer who has battled with booze, with Paul Gascoigne the most high-profile victim.

Sansom, 54, has been sleeping on a park bench and despite a brief stay with his elder sister, he disappeared again on Tuesday.

In an interview with The Sun, he said: 'I've been living homeless for 10 days.

'That's because I've got no money, I'm a drunk, I'm feeling not very well and I'm a gambler. I've been living on the street. It's not good living on the bench.

Sansom, who is England's second most-capped full-back after Ashley Cole, has been drinking seven bottles of rose wine each day.

The newspaper reports that he had just a pay-as-you-go phone, an Oyster travel card and £20 in cash when they spoke to him.

After earning around £1,200 per week and living in a £1million mansion during his playing career - which saw him play for England at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups - Sansom blew his fortune on booze and betting.

Sansom, who is divorced from his wife Elaine, has sold most of his England caps in his descent into alcoholism.

In his 2008 autobiography 'To Cap It All.. My Story', Sansom explained how he visited the bookies most days.

He then spent every afternoon in the pub drinking and playing snooker - earning the nickname 'Mr Chablis' along the way.
