The United States is closing its embassy in Yemen to the public until further notice amid political turmoil after the country's government resigned under pressure from a rebel movement.

The decision was made 'out of an abundance of caution and care for our employees and others who may be visiting the embassy,' a statement issued by the embassy said. 

'Due to the recent resignation of the Yemeni president, prime minister, and cabinet, and the ongoing security concerns, the US embassy in Sanaa is unable to provide routine consular services and will have very limited ability to assist with emergency cases involving US citizens.'

Earlier, U.S. officials said they had reduced staff at the
embassy.

Last week, the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour
Hadi collapsed after it was confronted by the Iranian-allied
armed Houthis movement. 

Yemen's powerful Shiite militia blocked access to Sanaa University on Monday as opponents to their takeover of the capital called for more demonstrations against their tightening grip. 

Washington is now deprived of a staunch ally in its
campaign against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

U.S. President Barack Obama insisted Sunday that his administration would pursue its efforts against al Qaeda in Yemen regardless of upheaval that led Hadi to tender his resignation along with Prime Minister Khalid Bahah.

The decision to close the embassy in Yemen was issued only hours after a drone strike reportedly killed three al Qaeda suspects in an eastern desert area of Yemen. 

The United States is the only country operating the unmanned aircraft in the region.

Yemen's parliament has so far postponed a session to consider Hadi's resignation, raising fears of a prolonged power vacuum after a Shiite militia kidnapped his chief of staff and seized key buildings across the capital Sanaa.

The State Department today warned U.S. citizens 'of the high security threat level' in the country 'due to terrorist activities and civil unrest' and urged them 'not to travel to Yemen.'

'US citizens still in Yemen should make plans to depart immediately,' the embassy said. 

Protesters hold a poster depicting Yemen's President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, left, and Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, a leader of Shiite rebels who hold the capital, amid a power vacuum, during a demonstration in Sanaa on Saturday.

'We are continuously analyzing the security conditions and will resume consular operations as soon as our analysis indicates we are able to do so safely,' the State Department said.

The unrest has raised fears of strategically important Yemen, which lies next to oil-rich Saudi Arabia and along key shipping routes, collapsing into a failed state.

Yemeni authorities have for years allowed the United States to carry out strikes against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and Hadi had been a central figure in the fight against the jihadist group overseas.
