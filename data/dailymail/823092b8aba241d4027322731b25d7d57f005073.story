England have landed in Rio de Janeiro as the start of their World Cup campaign moves ever closer.

Following an incredibly eventful friendly against Ecuador in Miami on Saturday, the Three Lions jumped on a plane straight to Rio, and arrived in the Brazilian city on Sunday.

To mark the occasion, Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain immediately took to Instagram to share the views from their hotel room, showing off the stunning stretch of Rio beach that they will call home for the next few weeks.

England touched down in sunny Brazil ahead of the World Cup finals after an eight-and-a-half hour flight.

 Hodgson's men landed at around 8.30am Rio de Janeiro time after flying in 
from Florida.

The team then made the hour-long journey to their hotel situated near Ipanema beach.

They begin their campaign next Saturday against Italy, before facing Uruguay and Costa Rica in their remaning Group D games.
