Darren Bent did not require long to show just why Steve McClaren sought his services this month.

The former England striker, signed on-loan from Aston Villa, arrived as a substitute in the 63rd minute with the match goalless. Five minutes later, with seemingly his first touch, he had edged Derby ahead.

Like his goal against Chesterfield in the FA Cup, this came from just two yards out – here, a poke home after Ryan Shotton’s long throw had been glanced skywards by Matt Kilgallon.

Man of the Match: Darren Bent

Attendance: 26,373 

Bent scored again in injury time, once more from close range. He tapped in when Chris Martin’s shot from Mason Bennett’s cross spilled his way.

Small distances, big difference. Bent’s impact means McClaren’s team move up to second, level on points with leaders Bournemouth. Already his temporary move, costing Derby around a quarter of his £65,000 per week wages, is paying off.

A joke cruel on Paul Lambert’s side swiftly emerged at full-time. Bent is now Villa’s top scorer this season – with five goals including two from his loan spell at Brighton. Andreas Weimann has four in a claret and blue shirt. 

Any thoughts Rudy Gestede might have of going the opposite direction to Bent this January were dashed when he lasted just 21 minutes.

Starting on the bench, he was introduced shortly before the interval following an injury to Tom Cairney, but was himself forced off midway through the second half. As he limped away he must have recognised this was this was far from a productive outing in the shop window. West Bromwich Albion and Hull have been suitors so far baulking at his £4million fee.

Oddly, Jordan Rhodes, another target for top-flight clubs keen on buying an attacking edge this month, remained on the bench even then.

Instead Gary Bowyer sent Chris Brown on for Gestede, and he brought a brilliant save from Lee Grant with a left-foot shot soon after.

Rhodes, who Swansea have looked at for £11m, only arrived when injury to Grant Hanley forced Bowyer’s hand. He was unable to alter the course of events.

Derby are continuing their push for promotion to the top flight with their latest win over Blackburn

Derby dismissed Chesterfield in their FA Cup match but still kept their promotion push on track

These two teams entered this match having enjoyed FA Cup victories. Derby dismissed Chesterfield, Blackburn stunned Swansea. Fifth round matches against Reading and Stoke can wait, though. At any rate, both clubs would take promotion to the Premier League ahead of cup silverware.

Derby were looking for a response to their last Championship encounter, a dramatic defeat here to Nottingham Forest. Blackburn had slipped into the distance of the play-off race in recent weeks, entering this match without a league win in four games.

Derby began the aggressors, pinning the visitors back. In the fifth minute Will Hughes cut inside and struck a sweet drive that crashed into the stanchion. In the 19th minute Jeff Hendrick fed Jamie Ward but the winger fired over.

By the half hour Derby’s passing was slick and a smart move involving Hughes, Hendrick and Martin saw Simon Dawkins teed up. He shot horribly wide.

Blackburn did have a chance three minutes before the interval, but Grant did well to scoop away Craig Conway’s dipping volley.

In all likelihood this match would have ended goalless but for the intervention of Bent, a player determined to prove aged 30 he still has what it takes to score in the top division. If he keeps going in this manner he might just fire Derby there.
