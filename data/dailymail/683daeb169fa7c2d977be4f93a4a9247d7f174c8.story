A former Utah teacher has been ordered to stand trial after a student -- one of three alleged victims of her sexual abuse -- testified that he had sex with her, even after her arrest.

Brianne Altice, 35, who taught English at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah, is accused of 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor.

The Layton, Utah, student, now 18, testified at a hearing Thursday that he had sex with Altice before and after she was arrested in October 2013 for having a sexual relationship with another student, The Salt Lake Tribune reports.

Multiple counts: One of the three victims Brianne Altice is accused of assaulting was forced to testify Monday and begrudgingly revealed he'd had sex with Altice after her arrest on charges she's assaulted another boy. A judge ruled Monday the former English teacher will stand trial separately for each alleged sexual relationship

Teen also testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during a yearlong relationship involving sexual intercourse and oral sex.

Altice also sent the boy a text message with a photograph of her breasts in June 2014, authorities said.

After hearing testimony from the teen and several other witnesses, Judge John Morris in 2nd District Court found probable cause for Altice to stand trial.

And prosecutors argued she should remain behind bars as she awaited that trial.

'It is a simple argument,' Deputy Davis County Attorney Susan Hunt said. 'While the defendant was on pretrial release, this defendant continued to engage in sexual misconduct with a 17-year-old boy

Her willingness to continue to commit felony sexual offenses while on bail causes great concern that this defendant will continue and be a danger to the community.' 

Her own attorney argued she was no danger because of the alleged victim's age, reports the Tribune. 

'She doesn't present a danger to anyone,' attorney Edward Brass said. 'That young man is an adult.

In the end, the judge ordered Altice to stay jailed. Bail had been revoked after allegations she had sex with the third victim following her arrest.

The judge also decided, this time in favor of the defense, that Altice would be tried separately in each student's case--meaning she'll get three different trials.

Will stand trial: Brianne Altice, 35, who taught English at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah, is accused of 14 felony charges, including rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and sex with a minor

Shocking: Prosecutors say Altice had sex with three different students while teaching English at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah. They say she continued her sexual relationship with one of them even after her arrest for another

The defense had argued that bundling the cases, as the prosecution want to do, would have be prejudicial to Altice's case, Fox 13 Salt Lake City reports. 

The teen on the stand said he was 'unhappy' to be required to testify against Altice. He said their relationship halted after he was arrested for witness tampering and retaliation against a witness in the case.

'It's ridiculous,' he said. 'She doesn't deserve to be here.'

Altice was arrested in December 2013 after a boy, 16, told police he had several sexual encounters with her. In October, another teen said he had also had sexual intercourse with her after they began kissing between class periods.

Altice, who faces up to life in prison if convicted, was fired from her teaching job last year. 

Altice's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students. 

'It is her defense that they did not happen at all,' he wrote in a motion. 'That she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students.'

But prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with the 16-year-old boy on two occasions.

The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body. 

Bond revoked: Altice has been held without bond since allegations emerged earlier this year that she'd continued the sexual relationship after her arrest
