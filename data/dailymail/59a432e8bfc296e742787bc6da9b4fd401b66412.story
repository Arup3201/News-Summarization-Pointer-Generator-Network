For those piling on jumpers at home, scowling at the frost outside and cursing the imminent heating bill, these nail-biting images will make you feel a whole lot warmer.

Stripping to nothing but a pair of speedos and a cap, more than 700 foolhardy swimmers today dived into a -27C pool carved open out of thick ice.

The ceremony hailed the start of the Harbin International Snow and Ice Festival, now in its 29th year, near the Siberian border of north east China.

Bitterly cold: Swimmers dive into a pool carved into the thick ice covering the Songhua River during the Harbin Ice Swimming Competition in the northern city of Harbin, Heilongjiang province today

Steam billows from the ground and swimmers can see their breath as they struggle to cope in the dangerous temperatures

Workers were employed to crack open the thick sheets of ice when the sun rose this morning to make way for the hundreds of swimmers

Centred around the Songhua River in Heilongjiang province, it is one of the nation's chilliest spots, with temperatures well below freezing, but that didn't wipe the determined look off the swimmers faces as they crashed into the bitingly cold waves.

More than 800,000 visitors are expected to flock to the crystallised city over the next few weeks with the festival expected to close at the end of February, weather permitting.

The day started with workers cracking the thick ice sheets using metal sticks.

The competitors, simply clad in swimming costumes, were organised into groups of age and gender then led out to race by invigilators wrapped in heavy-duty ski gear.

Here, one of the 700 competitors is led to his starting post by the -29C pool by one of the organisers

Competition: One swimmer steals a glare at another as they approach the ice blocks from which they are to dive

The excess snow and ice were swpt up and clumped together as they also tried to make space for the numerous spectators

Spectators stood shivering on the sidelines, with their hair gathering snow, cheering the groups to the other end of the 25-metre pool.

They were treated to steamed corn sold by at stalls covering in opulent snow sculptures.

And children took advantage of the fairground rides, such as carting around the pool in a dog-drawn sleigh.

Preparation: Tourists and locals prepare for months to compete in the festival, now in its 29th year, where there is also theatre, ice-skating and fishing

After cracking open the pool, organisers shaped clumps of ice into pillars to stand on the sidelines of the frosty water

Daredevils: Swimmers did not wait around before plunging into the pool, four at a time. Rushing off adrenalin, they scarpered to the finish line

Slip: This man looks longingly at the finish line as - near the start - his goggles come loose. But he ploughs on regardless

According to organisers, more than 10,000 people were employed to prepare the ice sculptures adorning the arena for the next two months.

Some of the pieces measure more than 26 metres tall and 117 metres wide. Overall, the whole site is well over 600,000 sq metres.

All in all, about 180,000 sq metres of ice and 150,000 sq metres of snow will be used to complete all the works.

In the evening, some of the structures are lit up in a beautiful light-show display.

Escape: Separated into groups of gender and age, the swimmers raced to the end of the 25-metre pool - before gasping and clambering to get out to the warmth

This woman swam in gloves in a bid to keep warm - but leaped into a blanket offered by a friend when she finally completed the one length of pool

Power through: Braving the conditions, many swimmers, like this man, emerged to the pool exuding confidence

Spectators were treated to steamed corn sold by vendors, like this one, at stalls decked in some of the opulent snow sculptures that will cover Harbin city for two months

From today, tourists will flock to the city to see sculptures, pet Siberian tigers, and go on rides, like this one where a girl is riding a dog-drawn sleigh

From today, tourists can enjoy the artwork for themselves in addition to the Ice Lantern Garden Party, skiing, figure skating and theatre performances.

Visitors may also wish to visit the event's Siberian Tiger Park or perhaps watch fishing and diving performances on the frozen river.

Others may wish to enjoy a tipple in the event's ice bar.

Harbin's festival is one of world's four largest international ice festivals, along with Japan's Sapporo Snow Festival, Canada's Quebec Winter Carnival, and Norway's Ski Festival.
