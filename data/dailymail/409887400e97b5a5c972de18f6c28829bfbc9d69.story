Elaine Rhoades had to be taken to hospital by ambulance after she suffered 'broken heart syndrome' following a day filming death scenes 

When actress Elaine Rhoades spent the day repeatedly filming a goodbye scene with her son on her character's deathbed, she never expected the emotional stress would have an impact on her personal life.

But the next morning the mother-of-four from Epsom in Surrey, was rushed to hospital in an ambulance with a life threatening condition known as 'broken heart syndrome.'

The condition, which causes the heart to stop beating is often caused by someone suffering a period of intense stress or grief.

It can be fatal because the syndrome can lead to heart attacks.

Ms Rhoades spent five days in intensive care and had to have blood thinning treatment before she was well enough to leave. 

'It's very odd why it should happen,' Ms Rhoades told the Sunday Mirror. 

'They said it was like I'd had a major trauma or massive shock. Doctors can't really explain it.' 

The 53-year-old had been filming scenes for C.O.O.L.I.O in which she plays a gangster's mother. 

She appears in the film alongside Kellie Maloney, who plays herself as a boxing promoter.

Ms Maloney filmed the scenes before she started sex change surgery. 

Ms Rhoades said she had tried to get into the emotion of the scene by imagining how she would feel if she was forced to say goodbye to her own son. 

She added: 'I pretty much spent the whole day dying, to get the take right.' 

The actress was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting in south west London by ambulance and doctors told her she could have died from the condition. 

Rhoades was filming scenes for C.O.O.L.I.O when the next day she had to be rushed to hospital 

They were also surprised she had managed to survive the night after filming without going to hospital. 

Around 6,000 people each year suffer heart attacks which are believed to have been caused by broken heart syndrome. 

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is the medical term for broken heart syndrome. 

It is a temporary heart condition that affects people who have suffered intense grief or emotional stress.

It is thought a temporary rush of stress hormones can weaken the heart muscle and cause the arteries to constrict. 

The condition causes a weakening of the heart muscle, affecting its ability to beat - making it known as 'broken heart syndrome.'

Symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath. 

It affects women more than men. 

The syndrome is different from a heart attack which is caused by a complete or near blockage of the arteries to the heart. 

The syndrome is different from a heart attacks because blood flow is reduced.
