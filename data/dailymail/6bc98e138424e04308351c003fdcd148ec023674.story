Sir Bradley Wiggins will miss the Vuelta a Espana in order to ride the Tour of Britain, Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford has said.

The 2012 Tour de France winner had previously hinted at riding the final Grand Tour of the season as part of his preparations for the Road World Championships in Spain in late September.

But Brailsford told BBC Sport: 'He'll ride the Tour of Britain.'

Omission: Wiggins was left out of Sky's Tour de France team due to his poor relationship with Chris Froome

The Tour of Britain is scheduled for September 7-14 - the final week of the Vuelta, which starts on August 23.

Sky team-mate Chris Froome is eyeing the Vuelta after injury forced him to withdraw from this year's Tour de France, and sending Wiggins to the Tour of Britain will allow Sky to keep the rivals apart.

Wiggins won a silver medal in the team pursuit at the recent Glasgow Commonwealth Games. 

The four-time Olympic gold medal winner recently suggested he could be ready to quit road cycling after being left out of Sky's Tour de France team but it appears Brailsford has convinced the 34-year-old put those notions behind him.
