New York is bracing for more tornadoes today after two twisters struck the edges of the city on Saturday, hurling debris into the air and knocking out power lines.

No one was injured but there was widespread damage and residents were left stunned. The National Weather Service has issued a severe weather warning for Sunday with locals fleeing the coastline and major sporting events being cancelled.

Tornadoes are extremely rare in the largest and most densely populated U.S. city. The first twister hit a beachfront neighborhood and the second, stronger tornado followed moments later about 10 miles away.

Rare sight: A tornado was spotted today off the coast of Coney Island in Brooklyn

Videos taken by bystanders showed a funnel cloud sucking up water, then sand, and then small pieces of buildings, as the first moved through the Breezy Point section of the Rockaway peninsula in Queens.

The second hit to the northwest, in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn also near the water, about seven minutes later. The National Weather Service said winds were up to 110 miles per hour, and several homes and trees were damaged.

Residents had advance notice. The weather service had issued a tornado warning for Queens and Brooklyn at around 10:40 a.m. The storm took people by surprise anyway when it struck about 20 minutes later.

'I was showing videos of tornadoes to my 4-year-old on my phone, and two minutes later, it hit,' said Breezy Point neighborhood resident Peter Maloney. 'Just like they always say, it sounded like a train.'

In the storm's wake, the community of seaside bungalows was littered with broken flower pots, knocked-down fences and smashed windows.

At the Breezy Point Surf Club, the tornado ripped the roofs off rows of cabanas, scattered deck chairs and left a heavy metal barbecue and propane tank sitting in the middle of a softball field, at least 100 yards from any nearby home.

A Fire Department spokesman said there were multiple power lines down and possibly other damage.

National
Weather Service meteorologist Dan Hofmann said an inspection team would
assess the damage and before estimating the strength of the storm. 
Hofmann added that some witnesses were reporting that the wind had been 
strong enough to lift cars off the pavement.

Lizann
Maher, a worker at Kennedy's Restaurant at the edge of Jamaica Bay, 
said she saw a 'swirling cone kind of thing with something flying in it'
come down and then head back out into the water toward Brooklyn.

'It was scary. We have all glass so we kept saying, "Get away from the glass!" just in case it did come back around,' she said.

The National Weather Service issued a 
tornado warning for Queens and Brooklyn as the storm moved through the 
city at 25mph. It expired at 11.30am.

An earlier warning indicated another severe thunderstorm capable of producing a tornado near Sheepshead Bay, or near Flatbush, NBC reported.

'It picked up picnic benches. It picked up Dumpsters,' said the club's general manager, Thomas Sullivan.

Half an hour later the weather was beautiful, but he had to close the club to clean up the damage.

The roof of Bob O'Hara's cabana was torn off, leaving tubes of sunscreen, broken beer bottles and an old TV set exposed to the elements.

'We got a new sunroof,' said O'Hara, who has spent summer weekends at the Breezy Point club for his entire 52 years. 'The TV was getting thrown out anyway,' he added.

The second tornado tore through parts of Brooklyn with strong winds, causing structural damage to several homes and felling trees.

National Weather Service meteorologist David Stark warned residents to take weather warnings seriously.  

'The threat is there and it's something we'll be keeping an eye on over the next few hours. Things could change very rapidly into the evening,' he said, according to Gawker.

Severe weather has been reported 
elsewhere in the country. Four people, including a young child, were 
killed when strong winds accompanying severe thunderstorms blew through 
northeastern Oklahoma, authorities said.

Two adults and a child were killed 
Friday when straight-line winds destroyed a mobile home in Nowata 
County, located along Oklahoma's border with Kansas, Undersheriff Doug 
Sonenberg told KSWO-TV. They were found in a creek.

Further east, straight-line winds 
flipped a semi onto a cement barrier wall, trapping the driver inside 
for nearly three hours near Afton in Ottawa County, the Oklahoma Highway
Patrol reported. Jimmy King, 70, of Ash Grove, Mo., died at the scene 
of massive injuries, troopers said.

The storms were part of storm system and
cold front that collided with triple-digit temperatures in much of the 
state on Friday. Wind gusts topping 70 mph were reported at Tinker Air 
Force Base in Oklahoma City.

The tornado struck as part of a line of storms that were expected to bring damaging winds, hail, heavy rain and possibly more tornadoes throughout the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Saturday. More than 1,100 customers lost power in New York City.

Across New York state, in Buffalo, strong winds from a broad front of thunderstorms blew roofing off of some buildings and sent bricks falling into the street. More than 6,000 customers were without power in East in Warren County, another 1,500 or so were without power in other areas upstate, and about 3,000 customers in the Hudson Valley were affected.

The city of Albany canceled the evening portion of an outdoor jazz festival because of the threat of storms, and hundreds of upstate New York homes lost power as the weather system moved through.

The storms overall knocked out power to about 1,100 customers in New York.
