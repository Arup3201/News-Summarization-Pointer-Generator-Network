An Instagram account dedicated to men wearing J. Crew's most popular shirt has taken the social media platform by storm.

That J. Crew Gingham Shirt, run by Jon San, a 27-year-old television writer in New York, dutifully documents ‘shirt sightings’ across New York City and in the media.

San noticed that the shirt had become increasingly prominent in society throughout the past year, when he decided to create the account.

‘It began when I went to a movie with a friend and I was wearing my J. Crew navy gingham button down. My friend showed up, and of course, he was also wearing the shirt. We sat down next to each other and were like, dude, everyone has this shirt!’

A few months later, San was watching The Internship, a movie starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, when he noticed the shirt again. ‘Owen Wilson is literally wearing that shirt for most of the movie,’ San remarked, ‘So I took a photo of it on my TV and I thought, there’s something to this.’

The next time he was confronted with a man wearing the shirt he took action. He set up the Instagram account, told a few of his friends, but still viewed it more as a small side project.

‘I wanted to see how often I could see this shirt, because I feel like I see it every day,’ he said.

The shirt itself is called the Secret Wash Shirt in Faded Gingham, and retails for $64.50 on the J. Crew website. 

J. Crew describes it as, ‘The shirt every guy needs in his arsenal, in a classic gingham pattern. It's exceptionally soft, thanks to our top-secret multistep wash process. (If we told you what it was, it wouldn't be a secret. Sorry.) Classic fit. Two-ply cotton. Button-down collar. Machine wash.’

San says while he doesn’t seek out men who are wearing the shirt, he has gone through lengths to track them down and document the sighting. He’s chased people down the block and will even run up next to pedestrians to confirm that they’re wearing the faded gingham shirt in question.

‘The shirt isn't hard to spot once you notice it, and once you do you’ll see it everywhere,’ he says, ‘I've become embarrassingly good at recognizing that shirt.

Paging the style police: San says before he shoots his Instagram photos he notes whether the item has been washed and ironed

‘I walk down the street, and I see the street as people who have this shirt and people who don’t.’

The shirt itself is only available in one color, navy. So softer colors and smaller checks are telltale signs of an imposter. San admits that after founding the account, he’s become increasingly interested in the origins of the shirt.

‘I want to know it’s an inside joke at J. Crew too. For such a wildly popular item I can’t even tell what season it’s part of.

Most of his sightings take place on the way to work in Manhattan. ‘But surprisingly,’ he noted, ‘I was in Brooklyn a couple weeks ago, and- I wouldn't have expected it to be a Williamsburg shirt- but I saw three in one night!’

The Instagram account documents all types of people wearing the shirt, however it’s clear that styling is critical. The shirt is basic enough that it can be tucked in for a formal look, but versatile enough that it can be untucked and worn over shorts.

‘I don’t tuck it in’ San noted, ‘but it’s okay if you do.’ Before uploading the photo to Instagram he also takes note of how many buttons are undone, how many times it looks like the shirt has been washed and if it’s been ironed.

He doesn't actively upload photos where he thinks people look bad and he tries to keep the comments on the Instagram photos fun and lighthearted.

Women have also begun wearing the shirt. ‘Just today someone tagged my handle in another photo, and the girl is clearly wearing the shirt. It’s the first time I’ve seen a women wearing it.’ San says he is dedicated to documenting the item no matter who is wearing it or where it’s worn.

Jon still has his original J. Crew gingham shirt, though he tries not to wear it too much these days. ‘I see it everywhere already, and I know if I put it on I’ll run into someone else wearing it.’

‘It’s just such a simple shirt. Any guy can put on this shirt and look good, to very good.
