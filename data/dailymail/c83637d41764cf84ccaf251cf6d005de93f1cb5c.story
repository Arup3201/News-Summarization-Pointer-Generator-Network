A rare copy of the comic book featuring Superman's first appearance that went undiscovered for over 70 years in the insulation of a Minnesota house has sold for $175,000 - making the construction worker who found it a happy man.

The high bidder for the copy of Action Comics No. 1 in the online auction was a 'hard core, golden age comic book collector,' Stephen Fishler, CEO of ComicConnect.com, said yesterday.

The buyer's name was not released but 51 offers were submitted before bidding closed Monday night.

This copy was found by David Gonzalez, 34, among old newspapers in the ceiling insulation of a
 house he was restoring in the small western Minnesota town of Hoffman.

Torn: David Gonzalez found this incredibly rare 1938 No. 1 issue of the Superman comic in the ceiling of a house, but the back cover of the precious find suffered a tear when he got into a fight with a relative over the value of the comic

He accidentally tore the cover when 
grabbed it and tossed it aside during an argument a few days later with 
his wife's aunt, which was part of the reason its condition was graded 
only 1.5 on a 10-point scale used by comic collectors, but he said in an
 interview last month that he really didn't care much about the money.

Fishler said the buyer had been 
looking for a several months for a lower-grade, un-restored copy of the 
Man of Steel's debut, rather than a copy in better condition that could 
have cost well over $1 million.

Fishler estimates there are only around 100 known copies of Action Comics No. 1, which was published in 1938.

He said it's prized not only for its rarity, but because Superman was the archetype of all comic book superheroes to come.

Fishler said the book's backstory was part of why it appealed to the winning bidder.

A pristine Action Comics No. 1 that 
was graded a 9 fetched $2.16 million in November 2011, which was the 
highest price ever paid for a comic book.

Gonzalez could have made nearly 
$200,000 if it were not for a heated argument with a relative that 
turned into a tug-of-war over a rare and valuable Superman comic book.

Gonzales, of New York, was renovating a house in Minnesota when he came across what is considered the Holy Grail of comic books.

The book sat undisturbed in the ceiling of the house in the town of Hoffman for over 70 years.

But
 a few days after he found it, Gonzales said, he got into a heated 
exchange with his wife’s aunt about its value, and she wanted a cut of 
the money.

He said he also grew irritated because every time she would turn a page, crumbs of paper would fall out.

Finally he said, he grabbed it and tossed it aside, accidentally tearing the back cover.

'I don’t care about the money,' he recalled telling her. 'I don’t care. It’s my comic book. I can burn it if I want to.'

Gonzales said the relative backed down when his wife warned her he was serious.

The lucky construction worker said he
 understands the ripped cover and other damage decreased the 
potential price. But he said that doesn’t bother him.

'I’m not a hungry person about money,' he said, adding that he’d rather work for it.

The selling price is ten times what Mr Gonzalez paid for the house where it was found.

The father-of-four from Hoffman bought the abandoned house, with a damaged roof, for $10,100.

When he tracked down the owner of the
 rundown house, he was told a restaurant had offered $10,000 to demolish
 the house and build a car park over it. So he offered an extra $100.

The discovery has amazed comic book collectors, who say that most of the Action 1 comic books have been sold numerous times.

Valuable: This grade 9 copy of the Action 1 comic sold for more than $2 miillion

Only about 100 issues of the comic, 
which sold originally for 10 cents, are known to exist and it is considered 
by many enthusiasts to be the Holy Grail of comic books.

'It's considered by most people as 
the most important book,' John Dolmayan, a comic book dealer and drummer
 for System of a Down, told NBC News. 'It kind of ushered in the age of the superheroes.'

The
 next most valuable superhero is Spider-Man, whose first appearance in 
Amazing Fantasy in 1962 attracts bids of about $1million at auction.

Zurzolo, the co-owner of 
ComicConnect, said it was miraculous that the Superman comic had survived for nearly eight decades.

'It’s
 so hard for anyone to fathom that, in this day and age, you could still
 discover a comic book that nobody has known about because this book was
 in a wall of a house for more than 70 years,' he said.

Superman has kept his popularity over the decades, generating a series of films, television shows and spin off series such as Smallville.

In the latest film, Man of Steel, which is due for release on June 14, fans of the superhero from Krypton will watch Clark Kent confront his secret background after Earth is invaded by members of his race.

The Superman find may have excited 
comic book enthusiasts, but Mr Gonzalez is taking a Clark Kent approach 
to his valuable discovery, by keeping his feet firmly on the ground. 

'I
 am a humble working guy, so I didn’t get too excited when I found it 
with old newspapers stuffed in the walls,' he said. 'Money won’t buy you
 happiness.'
