Facing prosecution: Greba Lilly, from Hull, who has been accused of fly tipping by her local council after leaving bags of clothes by a charity bin

When Greba Lilly dropped off three bags of clothing at an overflowing charity  recycling bank, she was thinking only of others.

But the teaching assistant’s act of goodwill has seen her accused of fly-tipping by the local council.

In a strongly-worded letter Mrs Lilly, 54, has been ordered to attend a taped interview under caution or face arrest.

Mrs Lilly, a mother of two, said: ‘I can’t sleep and I can’t eat. I’m so upset, worried, afraid, and stressed. I have never done anything wrong before. I’m a bit of a goody-goody two-shoes really.

‘If someone had told me I had made a mistake I would have rolled up my sleeves and cleaned it up myself.

‘That’s the kind of family we are and that’s why this has hit us so hard.’

Mrs Lilly fell foul of Hull council after she cleared her father’s house. He suffers from Alzheimer’s and has moved into a home to receive round-the-clock care.

Rather than throw away his old clothes, she decided to donate them to her local charity shop.

But as she was passing the local Asda on a shopping trip, she spotted the council-run recycling centre behind the store.

The recycling area was already littered with bags because the skips were full, so she left her three bags next to one of the charity clothing bins.

While clearing up the area of excess bags following a complaint from Asda, council officials identified Mr Lilly’s donations,  which contained stray personal papers with her details on.

Mrs Lilly added: ‘If I’d known what was going to happen I would have put them in the bin at home, but I like to give to charity.

‘There was a big pile of bags there so I just left my three.

‘Then I got this terrible letter from the council stating I could be arrested if I did not respond.’ Mrs Lilly said she has no choice but to attend the interview at the end of the month.

Local authorities have the power to question suspects under caution during taped interviews.

If the council does not find in Mrs Lilly’s favour following the interview, she could be handed a fixed-penalty fine for fly-tipping.

Recycling centre: Mrs Lilly received a 'terrible letter' from the council after investigators tore open the bags she left and found letters with her personal details

She is the latest casualty of a zero-tolerance approach by the council that saw a mother prosecuted after she refused to pay a fine when her daughter dropped a piece of sausage roll in Hull city centre. The case was later thrown out by a judge. Mrs Lilly’s MP, Labour’s Karl Turner, said this latest case was ‘complete nonsense’.

‘This legislation was meant to target unlicensed fly-tippers who cause a lot of damage – not people like Mrs Lilly,’ he said. ‘There has been a lot of public money wasted on this investigation already. Common sense should prevail but clearly it isn’t.’

'Completely bonkers': Karl Turner, Mrs Lilly's local MP, who has vowed to help her with her legal battle against the local council

Mr Turner, a barrister, added: ‘I have arranged for a solicitor to be present at her interview and, if it comes to court, I will be defending her myself.

‘I reckon it will cost the council £12,000 to prosecute this case and the most she could possibly get is an absolute discharge, so it’s completely bonkers.’

A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said it was ‘astounded’ at the treatment of Mrs Lilly, adding: 'Mrs Lilly was trying to do the right 
thing by giving the clothes to charity rather than throwing them away, 
so the council’s reaction was completely over the top.

‘Civic leaders in Hull should concentrate on providing the services for which residents pay considerable amounts in council tax, rather than spending scarce 
resources pursuing someone like Mrs Lilly.'

Mark Charlton, of the council, said it would pursue the case. ‘The council has received a complaint and an investigation is ongoing. Until it is complete we are unable to comment,’ he said.

Mrs Lilly added that her ordeal had not deterred her from recycling – but from now on she would only be doing it at home.
