England should not fear Italy, but apparently the big issue from those in the World Cup ‘bubble’ is how to stop Azzurri midfield play-maker Andrea Pirlo pulling the strings.

Former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez, now of Napoli, knows a thing or two about such things and has a solution.

No 1 is not to fear Pirlo.

No fear:  England must stop Andrea Pirlo if they are to have a chance of beating Italy

Rafa then argues against getting a forward like Danny Welbeck to do a man-marking job on the ageing Italian quarterback (Pirlo is 35) is NOT a good idea. 

Benitez says England should instead attack him on either side, pushing Pirlo firmly on the back foot, compressing his space and stopping him dictating the play.

That’s why Ross Barkley should start for England in the ‘No 10’ position - an argument endorsed by Paul Scholes.

Unknown: Ross Barkley could be the man to win the game for England

Mario Balotelli has been told by Italy boss Cesare Prandelli to concentrate on the World Cup and not get embroiled in talks about his club future.

So unlike Chelsea, who secured Cesc Fabregas two days ago in a £27million whirlwind deal, Arsenal will have to wait to pursue their interest in the former Manchester City striker.

Stay focused: Italy coach Cesare Prandelli wants Mario Balotelli to only think about the World Cup

England have only won two of their last 11 internationals against Italy (D3 L6), losing to them on penalties in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012.

The one previous World Cup came in the third place play-off in 1990; Italy won 2-1

A 0-0 draw between England
 and Italy is 5-1. If there are goals they could well come from a set 
piece - Gary Cahill is 28-1 to be first scorer. 

England have only lost two of their last 16 World Cup games (W7, D7, including two penalty shootout defeats).

Excluding shootouts, England have scored all eight World Cup penalties they have been awarded.

England boss Roy Hodgson has said all his players should sing their hearts out when the national anthem is played, the idea being that it will somehow enhance their display.

But my source in the camp suggests coach Gary Neville – who as a player kept a stiff upper lip on the anthem front - is not convinced that singing God Save the Queen will make the team play well.

And unless there is last-minute change, attempts to divert TV cameras away from focusing on ‘Red Nev’ have fallen on deaf ears.

Owing to the hot weather in some parts of Brazil, FIFA have agreed that the referee may call a halt to play two to three times per match to allow the players time to re-hydrate.

This could happened for the first time in England’s game on Saturday night, where the kick-off time was brought forward to satisfy European TV schedules rather than consider players’ well being.

It could be a long night.

Some well know soft drinks firms have bought advertising space in anticipation.

After Brazil, Italy are the most 
successful team in World Cup history. Italy have won the title four 
times — in 1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006 — and also finished as runner-up 
twice, in 1970 and 1994.

England’s group rivals Uruguay kick off their campaign ahead against Costa Rica in the 8pm match.

I hear suggestions that Luis Suarez will be ‘rested’ for the England game next week is just a bit of propaganda.

Virtually every nation is represented in the Premier League these days and Costa Rica have Everton’s Bryan Oviedo and Fulham’s Bryan Ruiz. Arsenal’s Joel Campbell, currently on loan at Olympiacos.

Arsenal are set to take 21-year-old Campbell back for next season but are then set to loan him out to a Premier League club.

Greece who play Colombia on Saturday have three nicknames   Ethniki (National), Piratiko (The Pirate Ship) and Galanolefki (Sky blue-white)

Piratiko refers to when they defied the odds to win Euro 2004 in Portugal. It came about in response to the fact that the Portuguese were early pioneers of overseas expeditions, ‘Greece became pirates and stole the victory’

World Cup memory

In the opening game of the 1982 finals Bryan Robson scored after 27 seconds against France a game England went on to win 3-1.

England were undefeated in that tournament but were still eliminated because the second phase was a league section rather than knockout.

Safe hands: Goalkeeper Dino Zoff lifts the World Cup for Italy in 1982

Italy won the final with 40-year-old keeper Dino Zoff their skipper.

Zoff went on to manage Lazio when Paul Gascoigne played for the Italian club.
