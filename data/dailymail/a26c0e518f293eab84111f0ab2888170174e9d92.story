'Bondage master' Bob Bashara has been found guilty of first-degree murder in a plot to kill his wife so he could devote himself to a life of domination with other women in an upper-class Detroit suburb. 

The salacious trial of the 57-year-old revealed his secret life in Grosse Pointe Park: a former Rotary Club president who used cocaine and hosted men and women at a sex dungeon underneath a bar called the Hard Luck Lounge.

The father-of-two arranged the killing of his wife Jane Bashara who was strangled by a handyman in the couple's garage in 2012. Her body was then discovered in her Mercedes-Benz in a Detroit alley.

Bob Bashara, 57, (pictured during a hearing in 2012) has been convicted of first-degree murder. Jane Bashara was strangled by a handyman, who Bashara coerced into committing the crime, in the couple's garage

Strangled: Jane Bashara, right, was found dead in her Mercedes SUV in January 2012 a day after her husband Bob, left, reported her missing. He repeatedly professed his innocence in the aftermath of her death 

'What man would make his own elderly mother hide a gun for him?' prosecutor Rob Moran said in closing arguments as he recalled evidence. 'What kind of man has two women come to the marital bed and have sex with them while his wife is out of town? Is that what a man does who's in love with his wife? No. It's the ultimate act of betrayal.'

The handyman, Joe Gentz, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2012 and said Bob Bashara coerced him into committing the crime. But as the trial was set to begin in October, Gentz said he wouldn't testify.

Bashara didn't testify but repeatedly professed his innocence in the weeks after his wife's death, even attending a candlelight vigil in her honor. Jane Bashara was a marketing executive with a long record of service to her church and community. Nearly three years later, there still are lawn signs that say, 'Justice For Jane.'

Defense attorneys urged the jury to keep their focus on the killer, Gentz, not Bob Bashara. They said Bashara could have continued his affairs and alternative lifestyle without getting rid of his wife.

'She is the breadwinner,' Michael McCarthy said in his final remarks. 'Why would he want her dead? ... There is reasonable doubt in this trial.'

Bashara is already in prison for trying to have Gentz killed in jail in 2012.

During the murder trial prosecutors called several witnesses to the stand including a bartender, a local Grosse Pointe business owner and a medical examiner who testified his wife, Jane Bashara, had very few defensive injuries - indicating she did not have the ability to fight back.

Prosecutors told jurors on  that the trial had revealed how Bashara lived a secret life in suburban Detroit.

'He created one world; he was living in another,' prosecutor Lisa Lindsey said during closing remarks. 'And when those two worlds collided, Jane Bashara ended up dead.'

The prosecution said the life he created revolved around 'Master Bob' and his desire to maintain control and create a new life with his mistress.

The prosecution used Bob's own words to tell pat of the story. First, pointing out how Bob worked to get police to investigate other theories, such as his wife Jane's alleged drug use and that she may have been killed by a drug dealer.

Bob's own emails took center stage and revealed his intense desire to be with his mistress and not his wife.

'He would say anything and do anything to be with Rachel Gillett. Several people have indicated such,' said Lindsey.

Bob's connection to Joe Gentz -- the calls, the text message and the desire to take him out -- was pointed out once again to jurors.

During the long trial, jurors heard testimony from police, the Bashara children, friends and even girlfriends who talked about Bashara's sex dungeon below a bar, the Hard Luck Lounge. He was known as 'Master Bob.' 

Bashara's mistress, Rachel Gillett, told the jury that they had talked about bringing another woman into their relationship.

The defense admitted that Bashara had major financial problems but he knew his wife had a job and savings. His defence argued that it would not have made sense for him to kill his wife when he had a steady stream of income.me.

There is no dispute that handyman Joe Gentz killed Jane Bashara, but Lindsey said he was threatened and coerced to do it by Bob Bashara.

Jane was murdered in their large home in the affluent Grosse Pointe Park suburb in Detroit  

Jurors didn't hear from Gentz. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for a minimum sentence of 17 years in prison, but then said he wouldn't testify against Bashara. 

In the second week of the trial, the court has heard how the 56-year-old was allegedly chomping at the bit to begin his new life with mistresses, Rachel Gillett and Janet Leehmann.

During emotional and lengthy testimony on Thursday, Gillett revealed that Bashara blindfolded her and another unidentified woman in 2009 during the start of their affair and took them to his family home while his wife and children were out of town.

The three then had sex in his marital bed, despite Bashara's alleged erectile dysfunction.

But Gillett told the court she was so upset with herself that she slept on the floor afterwards, even though she had been told that his wife was dead and he was a widower. 

The assistant medical examiner in Wayne County, Dr. Francisco Diaz, told the court in during Bashara's first trial in 2012 that Jane Bashara died from a combination of injuries, which included repeated blunt force trauma and strangulation resulting in her windpipe being crushed.

Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Lisa Lindsey told the court in opening statements last week that Jane Bashara's body was 'dumped in an alley like a piece of common trash.' 

During the first week his friend and fellow BDSM community member, Patrick Webb outlined how he met Bashara at a sex party he hosted. 

He told the jury that Jane Bashara, 56, clearly did not approve of his lifestyle and that Bashara told him he felt 'trapped' by the marriage to the mother of his two children.

'He wanted to do more with the lifestyle but he felt trapped with…Jane — with his wife. He didn't use her name,' said Webb to the courtroom. 

Mistress Rachel Gillett described details of the couple's kinky sex life during testimony. He reacted emotionally to testimony by some of the witnesses during the case 

'As people talked about divorce one night, it was let out that 'it would be cheaper to kill the b**ch,'said Webb according to CBS Detroit.

Also on the stand during the trial has been Bashara's former mistress, Rachel Gillett, who he referred to as his slave as part of their BDSM relationship.

She told the court that she met Bashara on a BDSM website and after initially telling her he was a widower, admitted that he was still married, but seeking divorce during their three year affair.

During his prior trial in 2012, his other mistress, Janet Leehmann, told the court how 'Master Bob' would send her dirty letters, a leather collar and a T-shirt he had worn for three days straight so she could smell his scent. 

Leehmann, who Bashara met on a BDSM website told the courtroom she regular engaged in 'breath play' with the accused wife murderer and agreed to having a polyamorous relationship to stop him cheating.

Leehmann testified that Bashara planned a trip from Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan to Oregon to visit her in January 2012, shortly before his wife, Jane Bashara, was killed.

Prior to him arriving he sent her numerous notes and messages including one saying: 'Hello SJ (her alt.com name). Soon you will feel my strength and passion.'

He also described how Gillett loved breath play - an erotic choking game.

'I can choke her just enough to make her woozy,' Leehmann recalled Bashara telling her of Gillett. 'I can do the same to you.'

And when he arrived at her home he did.

'He was standing behind me, he wrapped his hands around my neck and I passed out cold,' she testified. When asked by Lindsay if she consented to the asphyxiation, she said, 'no, not really.'

Leehmann said he responded: 'Well little girl you should have told me you were getting bad, I could have stopped.'

When asked if they engaged in sexual contact, she said no, adding that she was surprised.

'It doesn't work, his private parts,' she told the courtroom.

'I was surprised. He said he thinks it has to do with his weight.'

In their opening statements last week, Assistant Prosecutor Lisa Lindsey told the court that evidence will show that Bashara and Gillett were planning to buy a house where they could live with a 'second slave' - Leehman.

The case has rocked the affluent community of Grosse Pointe, with its white picket fences and manicured lawns.

Before his wife's death, Bashara was a successful local businessman, head of the local Rotary Club, a deacon at the local church and a backer of the Lochmoor Country Club in Grosse Pointe Woods.

Indeed, one month before his wife's murder, Bashara allegedly called his friend, James Wilson and asked him to cover for him.

'Bob called and said … 'I need you to cover for me this weekend. If anybody asks you (tell them) I'm with you,' said Robert Bashara's longtime friend, James Wilson on Monday.

According to CBS Detroit, the court heard how Bashara and Wilson would regularly smoke pot and take cocaine before they played golf at the club. 

Furthermore, Wilson told the court that Bashara confided in him that he liked 'to spank girls' but that his wife did not like it.
