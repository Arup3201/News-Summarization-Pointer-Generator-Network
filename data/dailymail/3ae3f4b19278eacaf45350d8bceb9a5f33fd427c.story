Liverpool supporters look away now - because now even the horse racing world is doing it's best to bring up a memory you would rather forget. 

The unfortunately named (or fortunately, depending on where your allegiances lie) 'Gerrard's Slip' ran in the 3pm at Southwell on Tuesday and unlike his name would came out on top.

Owner Bryan Smart, who also has the likes of Kool Kompany and Captain Dunne on his books, named the horse after Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's title-defining stumble against Chelsea last season.

The  horse was named after the moment Steven Gerrard (number 8) gifted the ball to Chelsea's Demba Ba

Making the headlines back in November when he made his racing debut - and consequently finished eleventh - the 3-year-old returned to the track to defy the odds.

But this tale is not all doom and gloom for the Red half of Merseyside, as the 3-year-old romped to victory by five lengths as a 10-1 shot.

As Liverpool prepare to take on arch-rivals Everton in the Merseyside derby on Saturday, Captain Gerrard - coincidentally the name of the stallion who fathered Gerrard's Slip - is expected to be given a starting berth in Brendan Rodgers' side.
