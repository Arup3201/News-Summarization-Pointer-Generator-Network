The wife of the former Green Beret doctor serving life in prison for the murder of his first wife and two daughters said her husband is 'at peace' now that new evidence is being considered in the killings.

Jeffrey MacDonald, now 68, could be granted a new trial at the end of a two-week hearing at federal court in Wilmington, North Carolina. If not, then his next chance at freedom will be in 2020 when he is up for parole.

He is serving three life sentences for the beating and fatal stabbing of his pregnant wife Colette and two daughters Kimberly and Kristen in their home at Fort Bragg on February 17, 1970.

Jeffrey MacDonald's wife Kathryn, who he married while in prison in 2002, told ABC: 'People are finally hearing what he has been saying for the past 33 years.'

The defense's case involves DNA from foreign hair 
fibers found in the family's home and statements from a deputy U.S. marshal and witness, both now deceased.

The brother of Helena Stoeckley, who 
was a key witness in the 1979 murder trial, told the court on Tuesday 
that his sister confessed she had been at MacDonald's home on the night his
family were murdered. She died in 1983.

MacDonald has always maintained 
that he awoke on a sofa at home as three men attacked his family and
a woman, wearing a blonde wig and a floppy hat, chanted 'acid is 
groovy, kill the pigs'.

Stoeckley - a known drug addict - repeatedly said out of court that she had been at the home. However she testified in court that she didn't remember where she was that night.

Prosecutors quizzed Eugene Stoeckley suggesting that his sister had told many people that she was in the house that evening.

Testimony on Monday focused on the sworn affidavit of the late Marshal Jimmy Britt who had  polygraph test.

He came forward in 2005  because 'he wanted to unload his heart
and his soul', according to defense Wade Smith.

Britt had driven Helena Stoeckley from county jail in 1979 for questioning prior to MacDonald's murder trial

She allegedly told him she had been in the house on the night of the murders and provided details about the house, including the presence of a hobby horse. 

Prosecutors discounted these remarks saying that pictures of the home's interior had appeared in a local newspaper.

Britt's statement said he heard Stoeckley then repeat to U.S. Attorney James Blackburn what she had told him in the car.

It is alleged that Blackburn told Stoeckley he would indict her for murder if she testified that she had been in the MacDonald home. 

Blackburn, who later went into private practice, was disbarred and served a prison sentence for ethical violations. He is expected to be called as a witness.

DNA evidence - which was not available at the time of the murders - also showed three hairs found in the home on the night of the killings did not belonging to any family member.

Those who believe MacDonald committed
the killings have said the hairs could have come from anyone - 
neighbors or other people who had visited the home.

The MacDonald family murders came six months after the Manson Family slayings in California, feeding into fears that Manson-type killers were on the loose in North Carolina.

The word 'pig' was written in blood on a headboard at the MacDonald home; the same was on the door of pregnant Manson victim Sharon Tate's house in Los Angeles.

The crime became the basis of Joe McGinniss' best-selling book Fatal Vision and a made-for-TV drama.

MacDonald's wife, Kathryn, was in the courtroom, as was Colette MacDonald's brother, Bob Stevenson.
