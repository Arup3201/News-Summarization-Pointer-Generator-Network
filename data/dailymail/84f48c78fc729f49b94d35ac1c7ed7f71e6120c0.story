Summerhayes saved her best score for the third and final run but her mark of 82.80 was behind Zimmerman, who took the title with 85.80.

Summerhayes said: "I'm really stoked, I stepped up each run the way I wanted to.

"It's taken a lot of hard work to get here and all the girls put on an awesome performance today, it was a great atmosphere out there."

Summerhayes had finished seventh in the ski slopestyle final at last year's Winter Olympics in Sochi.
