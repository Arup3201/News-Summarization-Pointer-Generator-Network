It's becoming a rather annoying ritual for BBC viewers.

You settle down to watch a much-anticipated TV drama – then have to crank up the volume or switch on the subtitles.

Just a month after the BBC’s Jamaica Inn was lambasted for its mumbling actors and poor sound quality, the corporation’s latest big release, Quirke, has been hit by the same complaints.

Drama: Crime series Quirke, starring Gabriel Byrne, has attracted complaints about its audio quality

Anger: TV star Richard Madeley was one of the viewers to vent his fury about the dialogue

Viewers watching the crime drama on Sunday night were furious when they couldn’t make out what was being said.

They reported having to switch on subtitles or turn up the volume to the maximum setting, while others simply gave up and turned it off. 

Set in 1950s Dublin and based on the novels by Booker Prize-winning author John Banville, Quirke follows the city’s chief pathologist, played by Gabriel Byrne, as he investigates a murder.

But it seems many of the 4.2million who watched the first episode in the three-part series struggled to follow the action, with TV presenter Richard Madeley leading the complaints on Twitter.

Madeley blamed the BBC’s sound editing, writing: ‘Was really looking forward to Quirke, BBC1, 9pm – but despite winding volume up to 100 per cent, still can’t hear at least a third of dialogue! Again!

‘And it’s definitely the programme – switched channels and sound boomed out massively loudly. Back to Quirke, and inaudible. Grrrrrr!!!!’

He persevered with the programme a little longer, then finally announced: ‘Oh well, I give up. Throws ear-trumpet away and hobbles upstairs to bed, prematurely aged by c*** c*** c*** BBCTV sound.’

Another viewer also blamed the quality of the sound editing, tweeting: ‘I spend 99 per cent of my time with subtitles! I’m 35 ... BBC buy new [microphones].’

But others blamed the actors for failing to enunciate properly, likening the effect to the mumbling cast of Jamaica Inn.

One viewer wrote: ‘Trying to enjoy BBC’s Quirke but too much mumbling and not enough enunciation! Jamaica Inn revisited?’

Before changing channels, another tweeted: ‘We turned over, can’t be bothered with whispers.’

They weren’t alone in turning off the programme in frustration.

Notorious: Jamaica Inn rapidly became known for its problems with inaudible dialogue

Another 
Twitter user wrote: ‘How far into Quirke did you get tonight? Shades of 
Jamaica Inn – mumbling and dark. Was this same director? Turned off yet 
another drama!’

After it was broadcast over Easter, Jamaica Inn generated more than 2,000 complaints about ‘incoherent mumbling’.

The
 BBC originally said that technical faults were responsible but following an 
investigation admitted another problem was that some of the cast 
had failed to deliver their lines clearly.

Last night there had been no official complaints to the BBC about Quirke or to television watchdog Ofcom.

Responding
 to the Twitter row, a spokesman for the BBC said: ‘There were no 
reported problems or complaints following Sunday night’s opening 
episode’
