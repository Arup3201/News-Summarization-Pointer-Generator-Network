A mother has hit out at environment authorities after a huge wall was built in front of her home as part of a flood defence scheme.

Zoe Hughes was left furious after the sea wall completely ruined the view  she used to enjoy from her kitchen window, which looked out over the pretty Loughor Estuary in South Wales.

The 33-year-old claims the wall is bigger than that shown on plans and wants viewing panels inserted into the flood defence wall.

Zoe Hughes is angry after flood defences she was assured would be no higher than her windowsills blocked out the sea view from her home in South Wales

Mrs Hughes says the view was one of the main reasons she and her husband bought their home on the Gower Peninsula, west of Swansea.

But her view was wrecked earlier this year when Natural Resources Wales installed a sea wall to protect the area from flooding.

She said: 'I burst into tears when I saw what they had done. I used to have uninterrupted views across the estuary, now it's a concrete wall.'

Mrs Hughes and her husband attended 'drop-in sessions' to look at the plans when they were announced and insists the designs showed a wall which only came up to her windowsill.

But she says the wall which has been built is actually much taller.

Mrs Hughes has demanded glass viewing panels be built into the wall to restore her view of the estuary

She added: 'Had I known what I know now I would have objected to the plans.'

Natural Resources Wales say the seawall is the same height as the planning consent and the designs were discussed with residents.

But a spokesman admitted: 'The impact at Mrs Hughes's house may be more pronounced than for other properties as it is further out due to the large foundations of the existing seawall and house.'

They said its £1.6 million scheme will protect 150 properties and that adding glass panels to sections of the wall would cost an extra £700,000.

Authorities admit existing foundations meant wall was built further away
