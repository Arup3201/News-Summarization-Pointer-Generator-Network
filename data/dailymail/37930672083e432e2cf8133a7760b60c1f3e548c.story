His father might be a Manchester United and Real Madrid legend but Brooklyn Beckham is well on his way to a stellar career at Arsenal.

The 15-year-old, already a Gunners fan, signed for the club's youth team late last year and has been showing off his sporting prowess on social media.

Much like his father, who was famous for his ability to strike a ball with his right foot, Brooklyn has been blessed with similar talent.

In a video posted on his Instagram account, the fledgling footballer is seen in his No.15 shirt booting a half-volley, which the opposition goalkeeper just about saved.

The teen, who previously had trials with Chelsea, Fulham, Manchester United and Queens Park Rangers, was first reported to have signed a short-term deal with Arsenal in November.

Victoria and David Beckham's eldest son was said to have impressed several clubs, but decided to go with the Gunners.

Brooklyn’s brother Romeo, 12, has also been playing for the club’s under-13s, while youngest son Cruz, nine, has been representing the club’s under-10s.

Despite inheriting his father's accurate right foot, Brooklyn is apparently embarrassed to be seen at training with his dad.

Speaking in a recent interview, David revealed that the 15-year-old asks to be dropped off around the corner, so no one sees them together.

Asked how he would be celebrating his upcoming 16th birthday, Beckham told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that his son was likely to celebrate with his friends separately revealing that he has been asked to stay well away from the school gates.

He said: 'He’s at the age now where he does not want me to drop him off outside school. He does not want too much affection but, yes, I still kiss him.

'He [said to me] "Can you drop me round the corner?",' continued the proud father. 'As he was walking into school, I wound down the window and shouted "I love you" to him. 

'He was not happy but it made him smile a few days later.'

Talking about to his son's 16th birthday celebrations on the 4th March, Beckham revealed it will be a low key - and family free - affair.

'I think he wants to go for a dinner with his friends,' said Beckham. 'He’ll have a separate dinner with his family because he’s at the age now when he doesn’t want me to drop him outside the school and things like that - which I definitely do anyway!'
