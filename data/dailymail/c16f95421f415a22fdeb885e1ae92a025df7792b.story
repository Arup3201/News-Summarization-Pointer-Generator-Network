Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi is ready to celebrate his 100th cap against Croatia on Sunday.

The Azzurri meet Croatia in Milan where at least one of Euro 2016 qualifying Group H's 100 per cent records will go.

Both have won their three games so far and look solid bets to reach France the year after next, but Sunday's clash remains an important one.

That is the case particularly for De Rossi, with the Roma man reaching three figures in the famous blue shirt.

"When I started playing football it was inconceivable for me to even think about reaching such a milestone," he told the team's official website.

"I will always have a place in my heart for this special game, especially when I can't play anymore.

"It may be that some younger players will overtake me someday, but still, this game will always be in my heart, it means that I was a part of Italian football history."

There will be no Mario Balotelli for Italy after the Liverpool man - back in the squad for the first time since the World Cup - suffered a hamstring injury in training and returned to his club.

Juventus defender Angelo Ogbonna is also out as a result of a similar complaint.

Coach Antonio Conte has called up 14 new faces to his squad but none will be involved against Croatia, with their selections made with Tuesday's low-key friendly against Albania in mind.

One man charged with bringing down Italy on Sunday is Inter Milan's Mateo Kovacic, who has been highlighted as a danger man by those in the home camp who know him well.

"I thank them for the praise. I think we (Croatia) are good, excellent, and have nine points and I hope we can continue at the San Siro," he said to Jutarnji List ahead of the clash at his club stadium.

"They may have said that because we are team-mates, but I thank them for their praise and we have nothing but praise for them.

"They will certainly be tough but we knew that already before. They are a good team with an excellent coach who has all the tactics. But we also have a great team and are in a good mood."
