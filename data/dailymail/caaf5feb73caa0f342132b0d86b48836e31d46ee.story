Burnley vs Tottenham Hotspur (Turf Moor) 

Team news 

Burnley 

Burnley boss Sean Dyche will make changes to his starting line-up for the first time in seven games when Tottenham visit Turf Moor on Monday in the third round of the FA Cup.

Defence is a worry for the Clarets boss, with captain Jason Shackell picking up an early calf problem in Thursday's 3-3 draw at Newcastle before his replacement Kevin Long suffered what appeared to be a serious knee injury.

Michael Duff (calf) has been sidelined for more than a month while Dyche must check on the availability of on-loan Manchester United centre-half Michael Keane. Dean Marney was also forced off at Newcastle through illness.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Cisak, Trippier, Mee, Reid, Wallace, Kightly, Sordell, Marney, Jutkiewicz, Boyd, Gilks, Keane, Barnes, Arfield, Ings, Vokes, Jones.

Kick-off: Monday January 5, 7.45pm

Odds (subject to change):

Burnley 7/2 

Draw 5/2

Tottenham Hotspur 4/5 

Referee: Roger East

Managers: Sean Dyche (Burnley), Mauricio Pochettino (Tottenham Hotspur)

Tottenham Hotspur

Ryan Mason is not expected to feature in Tottenham's FA Cup third-round tie at Burnley on Monday.

The 23-year-old midfielder lasted just 11 minutes of the 5-3 victory over Chelsea on New Year's Day after picking up a hamstring injury when stretching for the ball. Erik Lamela missed that match with a minor calf complaint and may not be risked against Burnley, against whom head coach Mauricio Pochettino is likely to rotate his squad.

Provisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Friedel, Walker, Naughton, Dier, Rose, Davies, Fazio, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Chiriches, Stambouli, Dembele, Paulinho, Capoue, Bentaleb, Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli, Lennon, Townsend, Soldado, Kane, Adebayor.
