Early autopsy results suggest skeletal remains discovered on a Nepalese mountainside do belong to missing West Australian man Matt Allpress.

Friends and family raised the alarm in November after the 23-year-old failed to arrive in Sydney following a solo 10-day trek in the country's Annapurna ranges.

Human remains were found on May 10 and his parents, Margaret and Mark Allpress, travelled to Pokhara police station in Nepal last week, where they confirmed clothing and personal items found nearby belonged to their son.

Doctor's early autopsy results suggest skeletal remains found on a Nepalese mountainside were of missing 23-year-old West Australian man Matt Allpress

On Thursday, Mrs Allpress went to the Kathmandu hospital where doctors have been examining the remains.

'The doctors advised that their preliminary findings were that the remains were of Matthew Allpress based on the dental and medical records provided by the family,' read a message posted on the Find Matt Facebook page on Friday evening.

'Mark and Margaret thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers ... they do appreciate your support.'

A 15-strong team of Nepalese police will now travel to the mountainous region where the remains were discovered in a bid to retrieve Mr Allpress's remaining belongings.

Tributes have begun to flow for the young adventurer on social media.

Mr Allpress was reported missing six months ago after failing to return from a solo 10-day hiking trek in Nepal

'Matthew you were (a) wonderful young man with your whole life ahead of you. May you now enjoy life amongst the stars,' Donna Garvey Noonan wrote.

Another friend, Jane Suckling, wrote that Mr Allpress had left a 'hole in all of the hearts he touched'.

Part of the remains, along with samples of his parents' DNA, will be sent to Melbourne for additional testing.

Mark and Margaret also hope the cause of his death will be determined.

Nepal police are planning to do further searches in the area where he was found to try and locate his backpack which is currently unaccounted for.

Family and friends updated follower on Friday via the Facebook page 'Find Matt'

MailOnline reported earlier in the week that human remains were located on Saturday by two local Nepalese people foraging in the mountains above Sikles, about one hour off the main track.

Police located several personal items belonging to Mr Allpress including his ATM card, 120 Nepalese rupees, a jacket, pocket diary and iPhone.

Until recently, Mr Allpress' friends and family remained optimistic of finding him alive, creating a social media campaign to help locate him.

Almost $10,000 was raised in December to help continue to fund the aerial and land search.
