A generous insurance boss spent more than £500,000 throwing an office party for his staff  - which even featured a concert by Olly Murs.

Millionaire Henry Engelhardt, 56, invited more than 5,000 people from his company to the free party at the Millennium Stadium, in Cardiff, Wales.

It was turned into a fairytale mid-summer spectacular for the staff of Admiral who partied the night away.

Rave on: 5,000 members of staff at Admiral partied the night away at the office bash thrown by their boss. It also included jazz bands, jugglers, clowns on stilts and even a zip wire for staff to fly across the stadium

Fun-loving chief executive Henry dressed up as Prince Charming for the event which had four different fairytale themes, a fairground and circus.

The climax of the night was an hour-long show by X Factor star Olly Murs who later mingled with office workers until the early hours.

One happy worker said: 'Henry really knows how to party - it was one of the best nights ever.

'We knew it was going to be an extravaganza but everyone was blown away when we walked into the stadium.'

Happy workers: Workers were given tokens for free drinks and food at the party from 6pm until 11.30pm

One side of the 74,000-seater stadium was Alice in Wonderland themed while another resembled the Great Hall in Harry Potter's Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

There were also a Cinderella Ballroom and an Arabian nights area complete with magic carpet rides.

Jazz bands, jugglers, clowns on stilts and the No Fit State circus were employed for the evening to keep guests entertained while a zip wire for staff to fly across the stadium was installed. 

Workers were given tokens for free drinks and food at the party from 6pm until 11.30pm.

However, it carried on until the early hours at nearby Tiger Tiger nightclub where staff had free entry and more free drinks.

Another worker at the South Wales based insurance giant said: 'We only have the party once every two years but it is worth waiting for.

'In the months leading up to it we all get emails with little hints about the theme of the night and who the star performer was.

'Henry’s parties just keep getting better and better.'

The event had five different fairytale themes, a fairground and circus spread out across Millennium Stadium

Olly Murs enjoyed the party as much as the staff - he joined them at the nightclub and was partying away until the early hours.

He tweeted the next day: 'Top night at the £admiralparty in Cardiff last night!! Definitely 5,001 sore heads this morning! Cracking night!! Thanks for having me!!x'

Sam Gould, who was DJ for the night, said: 'This was the biggest and best corporate event I have ever performed at.'

Chicago born Mr Engelhardt, a father-of-four who lives in Cardiff told staff the party was a reward for all the hard work they put in.

The Admiral Group is one of the largest employers in South Wales with 5,000 staff on their books.

The company is building a giant £60m headquarters in the heart of the Welsh capital.

Henry Engelhardt, CEO of Admiral Insurance

The founder and chief executive of insurance group Admiral wants his staff to have fun. 

When most businesses belonging to the FTSE 100 index might have a strict, no-nonsense style, Admiral has a Ministry of Fun - a team dedicated to organising weekly social activities for staff. 

This includes fancy dress days, nights out and even computer game matches in lunch breaks. 

This is all thanks to fun-loving CEO Henry Engelhardt.

Mr Engelhardt is originally from Chicago and said he never planned to go into the insurance industry. 

He studied journalism at the University of Michigan but got a job as a trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

He told the BBC earlier this year: 'I made a dedication to myself that if I could help it, I would never again work somewhere where I was unhappy.

'This is because it is simply very difficult to flip a switch and then be happy when you aren't in work.'

Mr Engelhardt and his French-born wife Diane decided to quit their jobs and travelled around Asia.

Later on, Mr Engelhardt joined the car insurance industry and worked his way up. After being headhunted, Mr Engelhardt set up Admiral and the company is now worth £4million.
