They are the bane of every driver's life, but today one traffic warden proved that they can be kindhearted after all.

On an upmarket street in Kensington a traffic warden made the decision to help a driver that had parked in the wrong place.

The brown Volkswagen Passat was parked in a bay that had been suspended while work was carried out.

Unusual: The car was taken to a different parking space 30 metres down the street

Tow: The driver was given a ticket, meaning he avoided the £200 release fee from a council car pound

Warning: Eyewitnesses say there were signs showing that the bay had been suspended

Kensington and Chelsea council workers then moved the car at 11am to another space rather than take it to the pound.

Witnesses say that the bay was marked off with signs and that the car was taken approximately 30 metres.

The driver was left with a standard £60 parking ticket,saving the costly sum of the £200 pound release fee.

Luxury: The street is one of the most upmarket in the capital with residents such as Liz Hurley and Hugh Grant

Suspension: Kensington and Chelsea Council temporarily suspend bays when construction work is being conducted in the vicinity

One eyewitness said: 'There was a suspended bay for a removal van or something and the car was parked there. But they picked it up and moved about 30 metres up the road. 

'Ive never ever seen anything like it before in my life. It was really quite unusual.

'They did the same to another car and took it round the corner.'

The car was parked in an upmarket area in the borough where Liz Hurley, Shane Warne and Hugh Grant live.

Kensington and Chelsea Council temporarily suspend bays when construction work is being conducted in the vicinity.
