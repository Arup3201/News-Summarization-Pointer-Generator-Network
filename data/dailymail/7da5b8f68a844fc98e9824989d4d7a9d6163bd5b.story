George Osborne's controversial measure to boost the mortgage market could lead to another housing bubble, Vince Cable warned yesterday.

The Government’s £130billion Help to Buy scheme could ‘inflate the market’ and push property prices even further out of reach of young families, said the Business Secretary.

It launches next year and is designed to help more people get on the housing ladder by providing lower deposits and loans guaranteed by the taxpayer.

But Liberal Democrat Mr Cable said he shared the concerns of experts who warn that it could artificially raise house prices by making it easier to get a large mortgage.

He told BBC1’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘Well I did warn about it and I am worried of the danger of getting into another housing bubble.’

Mr Cable said the scheme could be a ‘useful addition’ if it was ‘properly designed’ but added: ‘It could be a problem - it could inflate the market.

‘We mustn’t risk returning to the problems of the last decade when housing got out of control.’

The Business Secretary said the real problem was a lack of housing and claimed the current building rate of about 100,000 homes a year was ‘hopelessly inadequate’.

Pros and cons: Critics have warned that the Help to Buy scheme risks creating a housing bubble by pushing up prices

Under Help to Buy, the state will underwrite mortgages to help people buy properties worth up to £600,000.

Purchasers would need only a 5 per cent deposit, while the taxpayer guarantees up to 15 per cent of the loan.

Chancellor Mr Osborne, who announced 
the project in the budget, last week said it was ‘about getting behind 
those who aspire to own a home’.

The number of first-time buyers has soared to a six-year high after a revival in the property market, a report reveals.

There
were 120,000 new homeowners in the first half of the year – a rise of a
fifth in 12 months and the biggest number since a peak of 181,500 in 
2007.

But
a surge in house prices means 51 per cent of first-time buyers are 
buying properties within the £125,000 stamp duty threshold – up from 44 
per cent in a year, says the Halifax.

But warnings have been issued by experts, including former Bank of England Governor Lord King.

The
Institute of Directors has also described the initiative as ‘very 
dangerous’. Its chief economist Graeme Leach said: ‘The world must have 
gone mad for us to now be discussing endless taxpayer guarantees for 
mortgages.

‘They will 
drive up prices when it seems likely that house prices are already 
over-valued.’ There have also been concerns that the scheme could be 
exploited by migrants from the EU.

In
a wide-ranging interview, Mr Cable responded to concerns over the 
viability of a high speed rail link between London, Birmingham and the 
North following news that its projected cost has soared by £10billion to
more than £40billion.

He
insisted that ministers were not considering cancelling the project and
said its design could change to bring more benefits to the country.

Mr
Cable, who has been notoriously uncomfortable in coalition with the 
Tories, also insisted the Lib Dems would compete ‘independently’ at the 
next election.

‘We are equidistant between the other two parties,’ he said.
