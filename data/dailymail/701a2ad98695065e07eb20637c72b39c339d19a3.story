A small girl kneeling on the floor of an old mental asylum ward, the shadowy figure of a prison guard standing near a cell and a man lurking in the corner of a hotel basement.

These are the spine-tingling images that have emerged from some of Australia's most haunted destinations.

Together, medium Rayleen Kable and ghost hunter Allen Tiller have travelled around Australia visiting these sites on a mission to prove the existence of supernatural beings – and to help ghosts stuck in limbo 'move onto the afterlife'.

Ghost hunters capture what they believe is the spirit of a girl in the Grevillia wing, Beechworth Lunatic Asylum

The cast of TV show Haunting: Australia said that while on tour earlier this year a guest captured this image of what he thought was a male ghost in the basement of the notorious North Kapunda Hotel in South Australia

And while most people may be sceptical that they are finding real evidence of the supernatural Tiller says that's precisely why he does it.

In January this year, Kable and Tiller led a group on a tour around Australia collecting photographs, electromagnetic readings and sound recordings of what they believe are the spirits of figures from decades past.

The pair make up the local contingent of the cast of TV show Haunting: Australia, which is currently being replayed on 4METV and is due to premier on SYFY in the U.S. later this month.

While filming their eight-part series they visited some of Australia's most notorious haunted sites, but they say one of the spookiest visits they ever made was to Beechworth Lunatic Asylum in north-east Victoria in January this year.

A member of their tour group captured a haunting image of what appears to be a small girl kneeling on the floor in the darkness of the most notorious wing of the old mental asylum.

The Grevillia wing of Beechworth was where patients were given electric shock treatments and kept in strait jackets at the institution, which was operational between 1867 and 1995.

Visitors to the wing have often reported sightings of the ghost of a male doctor and also of a female matron. But Tiller said some of the female patients of Beechworth had children with them – providing an explanation as to what he believes is captured in the photograph.

Tiller said he also had his own personal haunting experience while at Beechworth, in a section of the asylum known as the 'bull pen'.

'It used to house aggressive youths from 18 to 25, and in there I heard a door slamming, and I audibly hear footsteps go up the hallway,' he said.

'Then we had clear EVPs [electronic voice phenomena] of a couple of people say 'Get out.'

Tiller – who says he is not a psychic or medium - uses a whole range of gadgets including full spectrum cameras, electromagnetic field detectors and voice recorders to gather 'evidence' of the spirit world.

Kable - who is both a psychic and a medium – said her experience at Beechworth was 'amazing'.

'It's definitely got activity and lots of it,' she said.

For Kable, the most disturbing experience she has ever had was at the notorious North Kapunda Hotel in South Australia

For Tiller the most interesting experience was catching what he believes is evidence of the spirit of a young girl called 'Sarah'. The hotel once served as a brothel, and legend has it that when a prostitute was murdered inside the hotel her young daughter 'Sarah' was taken in by the hotel's madam

'We got some really Class A 'EVPs'– and basically what that is is a recording of a spirit so you actually hear it on a recorder.

'I actually got this disgruntled spirit that said my name clearly… you just hear this spirit screaming down my recorder.'

For Kable, the most disturbing experience she has ever had was at the notorious North Kapunda Hotel in South Australia when a disgruntled male spirit tried to attach itself to her in the 'Hallway of Hell'.

'It was definitely a male spirit, but I wouldn't say a happy male spirit,' she said.

Tiller said he and other tour guests had their own encounters with ghosts while at Kapunda. One guest captured an image of what he believes is a man standing the corner of the hotel's basement.

The hotel once served as a brothel, and legend has it that when a prostitute was murdered inside the hotel her young daughter 'Sarah' was taken in by the hotel's madam.

'I was closing up the top of hotel after a tour and I saw a little girl standing in hallway,' he said.

'She ran down the hall to take her out of the hotel and she looked solid… she was laughing.

Tiller said he had another haunting experience while at Geelong Gaol in Victoria

He was in a section upstairs on the third level when he says he heard a 'low whispery growl'

'She's been seen multiple times.

'You can say "Are you here Sarah?" and she'll light up different devices.'

Tiller said he had another haunting experience while at Geelong Gaol in Victoria.

'I was in a section upstairs on the third level and I had a psychic tell me there was something evil in the corner,' he said.

'While I was waiting I actually heard a low whispery growl in there, and there was no way an animal could get in there.

'That was pretty spooky.'

At the same site fellow Haunting: Australia cast member Gaurav Tiwari captured an image of what he believes to be a prison guard standing near the stairs.

The image appears red and purple because it is taken with a full spectrum camera – a favourite among ghost hunters who say it is like a video camera that has filters removed meaning it shows light spectrums the human eye can't see.

Kable says she does the work she does in order to help spirits that are 'stuck'.

Tiller accepts that people may be sceptical of the existence of ghosts and supernatural beings, but that doesn't stop him trying to prove they're out there

'For me as a medium my objective is if that spirit needs help and wants to move on, I help them,' she said.

'If they don't want to move on my second objective would be to give validation to the spirit world.

'For anybody who's a witness and anybody in that location that really does want to believe and understand the afterlife, that there is a way for them to communicate from whatever realm they're in to our realm.'

Tiller accepts that people may be sceptical of the existence of ghosts and supernatural beings, but that doesn't stop him trying to prove they're out there.

'I'm there to record anything that might come up, with the outcome being hopefully that we can prove life after death,' he said.

'A lot of people think dying is the end.

'But if people knew there was a possibility that we move on, stress levels would drop off and people would have peace of mind.'
