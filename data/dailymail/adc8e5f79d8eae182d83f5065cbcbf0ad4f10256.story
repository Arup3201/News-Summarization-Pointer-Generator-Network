A man was found dead in the parking lot of Grand Valley State University, Michigan, just hours after he had used a computer at the campus to research symptoms of a heart attack.

The body of Phu Quoc Thieu Tran, 39, was found in a car by a security guard at the DeVos Parking Lot on Monday morning.

An autopsy performed later that day determined that the cause of Tran’s death was determined to be arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

‘It appears that he had been using the university’s computer lab and was researching health issues,’ Lt. Patrick Merrill told WWJ.

Tran was a student at Grand Rapids Community College, and had been at the GVSU computer lab on Sunday night. 

When police checked the computer he had used, they discovered he was researching symptoms common in a heart attack - tightness of the chest and sweating - on the webmd.com website.

They said it appears he then got back into his car, in which he had been living, reclined in the front seat and covered himself with a blanket, reports WoodTV.com.

‘Maybe he thought he would just lay down for a minute and feel a little better, but unfortunately he passed away,’ Merrill said.
