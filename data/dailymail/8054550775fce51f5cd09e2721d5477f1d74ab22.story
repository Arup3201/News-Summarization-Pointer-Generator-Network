On first impressions this colorful image of household items looks like a clever montage of four separate photos assembled to look like one picture.

But look again and you start to see several ‘tells’ throughout the image which shown continuity between the different segments (the blue chair, table lamp, mop handle, etc) that prove it is actually a single photo full of cleverly arranged objects to create the optical illusion of being four separates.

The deceptive-looking single shot photo is the work of New York-based artist Bela Borsodi.

Rather than using photoshop or some other post processing technique, he created the image by painstakingly arranging the items via a process of trial and error and looking at the scene through the viewfinder of his camera until the illusion was just right.

Through the careful positioning of objects and their edges, Borsodi was able to make a single static scene look like four separate photographs that were placed side-by-side.

It was created as the album cover for the band VLP's latest release ‘Terrain.’

‘I love making things and putting things in an unusual context incorporating various visual languages coming from art and graphic design–eroticism is also a fascination of me that I love exploring,’ said Austrian-born Borsodi.

The photo - taken from a slightly different angle - gives some idea of just how painstaking the process was of arranging the items just right to create the optical illusion
