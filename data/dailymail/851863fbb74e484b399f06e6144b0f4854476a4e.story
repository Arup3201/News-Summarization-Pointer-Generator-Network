A gleaming green comet tore across the United States in its closest encounter with Earth to date. 

Comet Lovejoy lit up the night's sky on Wednesday, shooting north.

It was the final burst for the newly-discovered meteor, which has already been seen rocketing over Europe and Asia. 

And the astronomer who first spotted the rare wonder said next time it may come even closer.

Spectacular: Comet Lovejoy is currently whizzing northwards past Earth, leaving an incredible glowing green tail in its wake

'It is very exciting from the point of view, not just from the point of finding a named object, but from the point of view the time spent developing the comet searching system has paid off,' Lovejoy told CNN.

'There is also excitement around what the comet might do, so there is a couple of days before it is possible to determine the future path of a comet which has a large bearing on how close it will get to us and how bright it might get.' 

For the past week, the comet has been getting brighter every day making it easier for those in the Northern Hemisphere to spot 

Comet Lovejoy, is around 43 million miles from Earth and was thought to be travelling at around 15 miles a second.

The comet, also known as C/2014 Q2, was first spotted by Australian Terry Lovejoy, who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers.

To date, Mr Lovejoy, from Queensland, has discovered five comets, all using relatively simple equipment compared to what's found at a professional observatory.

It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world.

Comets are essentially piles of rock, gravel, and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice.

As the comet nears the sun, its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight.

They also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the Earth's orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers.

As the graph shows though, the comet's trajectory does not take it inside the Earth's orbit.

At its current levels of brightness, Lovejoy can be spotted with the naked eye - although a full moon tonight will make viewing more difficult.

A comet's brightness is measured by magnitude and on the astronomical magnitude scale, lower numbers indicate more intense brightness.

Lovejoy started off at magnitude 15 brightness and has since reached magnitude 5, the brightness necessary to be seen without the aid of a telescope. 

As National Geographic reports, comet Lovejoy should hit magnitude 4.1 in mid-January, which would mean that sightseers could spot traces of the comet 'from light-polluted city suburbs'.

Some observers were able to spot Lovejoy in late December as it reached magnitude 5.3.

Lovejoy's  striking color is due to two gases emanating from the comet: cyanogen and diatomic carbon, which both glow green when sunlight passes through them.
