BBC sports presenter Clare Balding begins her coverage of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, today, appearing in a series of ice-cool official publicity photographs.

The 43-year-old Brit, who also covered the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games for the BBC, has just introduced the opening ceremony, shrugging off a number of Twitter trolls who hounded her for attending the games, given Russia's abhorrent stance on gay rights.

Both Balding and her long-term partner Alice Arnold - who were united in a civil ceremony in London in 2006 - have been standing by her decision to present the games, both on the social networking site and off.

According
 to the Evening Standard, Balding revealed in an email read out at a Cambridge Union 
debate yesterday that she was being 'hounded on Twitter by 
those who think I should stage a one-woman boycott - which seems odd to 
me as I thought the point was to defend the rights of gay people'.

She continued: 'More
 questions are being asked about gay rights than Vladimir Putin has 
faced in his life and he is aware (perhaps for the first time) that his 
attitude damages the way Russia is perceived in the West.'

One user, @Anthonyb96293, wrote 'Clare Balding should be buried alive', which Arnold retweeted.

He later apologised for his comment and removed it, citing a serious lapse in judgement.

Nonetheless, Twitter was flooded with support for the sporting enthusiast as soon as she began presenting from Russia this afternoon, with users calling her a 'national treasure'.
