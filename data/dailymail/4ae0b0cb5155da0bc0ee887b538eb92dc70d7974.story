A British worker was yesterday thought to be among eight people kidnapped by gunmen in Nigeria.

The raiders, thought to be Islamists, killed a security guard and snatched seven workers and a baby during a raid on a construction firm.

Workers from Britain, Italy and Greece were taken alongside four Lebanese colleagues, including two women, one of whom had a baby girl, police said.

Location: The overnight attack, which first targeted a prison, happened in Bauchi state in northern Nigeria

The gunmen attacked a prison and set 
two police vehicles on fire before killing a guard at the workers’ camp,
run by construction company Setraco.

The kidnappers used explosives to force their way into the complex in the town of Jama’are, in Bauchi state, north-east Nigeria.

Police said the group had attacked 
the prison and trucks as a diversion before launching the raid on the 
construction compound, its real target.

Foreign embassies have issued travel warnings over northern Nigeria for months. 

Abduction fears have risen in recent weeks with the French military intervention in Mali, as its troops and Malian soldiers try to rout out Islamic fighters who took over that nation's north in the months following a military coup. 

Last week, the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Abuja put out a warning following the killings of polio workers in the northern city of Kano and the killing of the North Korean doctors.

‘The security situation in some parts of Nigeria remains fluid and unpredictable,’ it said.

Authorities in Italy, Greece and the 
Lebanon said their nationals had been taken but the Foreign Office in 
London is yet to confirm that a Briton was involved.

Saturday night’s raid comes just a 
month after six British workers were among at least 37 hostages killed 
during a rescue attempt at a BP plant in Algeria.

The kidnap of foreign workers for ransom has become a lucrative trade in Nigeria.

While no-one has claimed 
responsibility so far, Islamic extremists have carried out a bloody 
guerilla campaign in the past year, including kidnappings and murders.

The sect known as Boko Haram, whose 
name means ‘Western education is forbidden’, has been blamed for killing
almost 800 victims last year.

Last March a British hostage, Chris 
McManus, 28, from Oldham, was murdered by his Islamist captors during a 
botched rescue in Sokoto.

Setraco was unavailable for comment.

Adamu Aliyu, the chairman of the local
government area that encompasses Jama're town, identified those kidnapped as
one British citizen, one Greek, one Italian and four Lebanese.

'There was an attack on the Setraco 
construction company site in Jama'are town by unknown 
gunmen,' Bauchi State Police Chief Mohammed Ladan told the Agence 
France-Presse agency.

A British Foreign & Commonwealth 
Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of reports and we are 
making enquiries with the authorities.'

Setraco is an engineering construction
company that has existed for more than 35 years and has 'played a key 
role in developing Nigeria’s infrastructure', according to its website.

Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north 
has been under attack by the radical Islamic sect known as Boko Haram in
the last year and a half.

The country's weak central government 
has been unable to stop the group's bloody guerrilla campaign of 
shootings and bombings. The sect is blamed for killing at least 729 
people just last year.

Last month around 40 hostages, six understood to have been Britons, were killed in an attack on the In Amenas gas field in Algeria.

Some 29 of the hostage-takers died, while three were captured by Algerian troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand-off which began on January 16.

In the wake of the crisis, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to put terrorism 'right at the top of the agenda' for Britain's presidency of the G8 nations this year and vowed to show 'iron resolve' in tackling Islamist threats.

Foreigners, long abducted by militant 
groups and criminal gangs for ransom in Nigeria's oil-rich southern 
delta, have become increasingly targeted in Nigeria's north as the 
violence has grown.

In May, gunmen in Kaduna state shot 
and killed a Lebanese and a Nigerian construction worker, while 
kidnapping another Lebanese employee.

Later that month, kidnappers shot a German hostage dead during a rescue operation.

Gunmen who authorities say have links 
to Boko Haram also kidnapped an Italian and a British man last year in 
northern Kebbi state who were later killed during a rescue operation by 
Nigerian soldiers backed up by British special forces. The sect later 
denied taking part in that abduction.

Chinese construction workers also have
been killed by gunmen around Maiduguri, the north-eastern city in 
Nigeria where Boko Haram first began.
