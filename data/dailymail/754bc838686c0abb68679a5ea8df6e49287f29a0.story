Children should learn about the medical world from the age of seven to encourage them to become doctors, according to experts.

They say primary school pupils should have the chance to meet people working in medicine, visit universities and take part in practical medical and science workshops.

The advice, published by the Medical Schools Council which represents medical schools all over the country, comes amid concerns that youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds are still much less likely to study the subject.

Only two fifths of doctors attended non-selective state schools, while a third were privately educated.

Medicine is a very popular career choice, the guidance says, with fierce competition. 

'Medical schools have worked hard so that they can attract the right candidates and to establish admissions processes which are fair to all,' it says.

'Yet it remains that more needs to be done to ensure that the medical profession is representative of the society it serves, and that medical students are able to learn in a diverse environment.'

This is the first time that the council has published advice on how to widen access to medical courses.

It suggests that the 'journey to medicine' should start in primary schools, an area which is sometimes overlooked by medical schools.

Pupils should be told about the qualifications and routes to becoming a doctor, the guidance says, and take part in 'lively and fun' activities linked to the profession.

This could include roadshows, campus visits, demonstrations and workshops.

'Medical students acting as ambassadors are often the best people to lead activity, which can include demonstrations, campus tours and mentoring,' it says.

'Some medical schools formally recognise this work by medical students as part of their educational development.'

In secondary schools, students should be taught about studying medicine at university and what a career in the profession involves.

This includes helping pupils make the right subject choices for their GCSEs, Scottish Nationals, A-levels and other qualifications.

The guidance goes on to suggest that when pupils are in the sixth-form, medical schools could offer would-be students help in making applications, including support in writing personal statements and preparing for interviews and admissions tests.

Experts said primary school pupils should have the chance to meet people working in medicine, visit universities and take part in practical medical and science workshops to help encourage them to train up

They could also run master classes and summer schools for secondary school pupils of all ages.

Professor Tony Weetman, chair of the Selecting for Excellence Executive Group, said: 'A candidate's journey to a medical degree starts long before the Ucas application is made.

'The commitment in terms of hard work and academic achievement is of course essential, but before that must come the awareness that studying medicine is an option. 

'That realisation does not come readily to all potential candidates, be they school students or mature learners, and we know that one's background will play a central part here.

'Medical schools cannot leave potentially excellent candidates to learn this message on their own; they have a responsibility, where possible, to reach out to these people and show them first-hand that a career in medicine is for anyone with the ability and commitment.'

Professor Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, said: 'This guidance represents a major development in helping to improve access to the elite medical profession. 

'Going to medical school opens the door to a career in a rewarding, high-status profession and that door should be open to everyone who has what it takes to be an excellent doctor, regardless of their background.'
