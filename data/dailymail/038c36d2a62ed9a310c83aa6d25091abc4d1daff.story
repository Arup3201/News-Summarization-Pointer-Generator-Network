Fire services across England could be radically reformed to save £200million a year under proposals being considered by ministers.

The number of call-outs has nearly halved in ten years to an all-time low, but fire service spending and staffing levels are ‘broadly the same’, a Government-commissioned report found.

It said there was room for major ‘efficiencies’, including cutting numbers of full-time fire crews manning stations and replacing them with ‘retained’ staff on call at home – without compromising public safety.

Reform: England's fire services could save up to £200million by consolidating, according to a new report

Sir Ken Knight, former chief fire and rescue adviser for England, also recommended merging some of the 46 fire services. He said the traditional 24-hour crew at fire stations ‘had no place in a modern fire service’.

But the report has provoked fury from unions, who say the reforms would see services ‘slashed to pieces’.

Sir Ken’s report said one fire service could spend twice as much per head as another and achieve the same response times.

If all authorities spending above the national average reduced their spending to that level, fire services could save £196million a year, he said.

Attendance at emergencies, including home and outdoor fires, car crashes and floods, fell by 40 per cent between 2001/02 and 2011/12. For fires alone, it dropped by 48 per cent.

Sir Ken said these reductions were down to the ‘hard work and professionalism’ of firefighters, as well as awareness campaigns and an increase in the use of smoke alarms.

With this ‘massive reduction’, he said the service’s role had switched from emergency response to ‘reducing risk’ through awareness campaigns.

But he wrote: ‘Despite these changes, no significant change in the make-up or cost of the service has taken place. Fire and rescue authorities now need to transform themselves to reflect the entirely different era of risk and demand they operate in.

‘It is a fact that while most local authorities are feeling the pressure of reduced funding and increased demand for their services, in the case of fire and rescue services there remains a significant decrease in demand.’

Increasing the number of ‘retained’ firefighters – who train one day a week and are called up only in an emergency – from 30 per cent of the service to 40 per cent would save £123million a year, he said.

Sir Ken said yesterday: ‘I know firefighters care deeply about public safety and do the best possible job. I’ve seen their capacity to adapt, even in the most trying of circumstances, but my report highlights that there is much more that can be done by the service leaders to make the service as effective and efficient as possible.’

Dave Green, of the Fire Brigades Union, warned that lives could be lost. He said: ‘Response times will increase and the public will be at risk – at greater risk – and the blunt fact is that lives could be lost.’

The Department for Communities and Local Government said it  welcomed the report.

Inefficient: Many of the country's 46 fire services have overlapping office functions, it has emerged

Merging? Fire services could join up together to reduce their necessary overheads

A report published today called on fire services to consider collaborating or even merging to save money. Here its author, SIR KEN KNIGHT, reveals how his love of the service compelled him to lay out a radical path for its future.

Time for change: Sir Ken Knight has called for radical reform to England's fire services

Our fire service is great at saving lives. But it's not so good at saving money.

The conclusion of the review I'm publishing today is that it needs to change.

I’ve been privileged to spend more than 40 years working in the fire service, from a raw recruit at 21 to the head of London’s fire brigade. I have personally experienced the highs and lows, and the challenges faced by firefighters from fires, rescues, as well as the satisfaction of saving lives through community safety initiatives.

The fire service is in my blood and I have a deep affection and respect for the professionalism, bravery and commitment of all those who serve their communities every day.

I believe that nothing should compromise the ability of the fire service to keep people safe in their homes.

But sometimes our admiration for those fine men and women blinds us from the reality of the fire service today.

I know the service inside and out. And I know times have changed.

When I began my career, it was mainly about reaction to emergencies after they had occurred. But today prevention is our calling card. And the effect has been seismic.

We’ve seen a 40 per cent drop in call outs and incidents in the last decade.

Death caused by fires in the home has dropped to an all time low in my 40 years of service.

This is good news, and make no mistake, our fire service is behind this success - educating children, families and older people to take fire safety seriously.

But we can’t ignore the difference that modern technology and modern marketing have made too.

Smoke alarms, better quality housing and furniture, and fire awareness campaigns are as essential to safety as the traditional hose and ladder to douse the flames.

And just as the risks we face have reduced and changed significantly, you would expect our fire fighting organisations to adapt accordingly.

But this has not been the case.

In writing my review I travelled up and down the country, speaking to those who work in the fire service and probing to find out what was happening on the ground.

I found that many fire authorities are spending to their budget but not to their risk.

I also unearthed a lack of uniformity in the way they provide services and discovered that the ratio of managers to firefighters varies wildly depending where you are - from 22 fire fighters per senior manager to more than 70.

This immediately concerned me, especially when I saw the cost of a service in one area was almost double that of another. Despite the fact there seems to be little correlation between big spending and fire reduction.

It’s clear there’s room for savings when fire services have amassed huge capital reserves – increasing from just over £200m to more than £400m between 2008-2012

In an age of austerity, it’s difficult to comprehend. If the most expensive services could reduce their cost to the same as the national average they would save nearly £200 million of hard-pressed council taxpayers’ money a year.

So it’s time for some serious soul searching

Not just for fire chiefs and firefighters but local political leaders too.

Can it be right that one service costs so much more than another?

Should there really be 46 fire and rescue authorities, each with different governance structures, senior leaders, and organisational and operational quirks?

Why do we tolerate the widespread duplication of effort in the design, commissioning and evaluation of fire-specific products?

Why aren’t the best ideas from one place implemented in another? Why is waste not being tackled?

Like all public services, fire and rescue authorities must evolve and in doing so find new solutions. Local political leaders should encourage their fire chiefs to raise their game share innovation not just with each other but across the blue light services to ensure best practice and sharing resources.

My review is a call to action, it is for the Government to consider and for the fire service to respond.

And knowing them like I do, I feel completely confident they will, and deliver a quality of service we can all be proud of.
