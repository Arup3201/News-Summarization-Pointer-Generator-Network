Thousands of teachers and other public sector workers are employed by off-shore firms in a scheme described as ‘the next big UK tax scandal’.

Taxpayers are losing out on millions of pounds in national insurance contributions because of the controversial arrangements, a BBC investigation has claimed.

Schools and councils which hired the teachers could now be forced to foot the bill for the unpaid tax.

One firm based in Sark, one of the Channel Islands, employs more than 24,000 temporary agency workers in the UK, mostly supply teachers, according to the investigation by BBC 5 Live. The staff are recruited by UK-based recruitment agencies, which insist they use the services of the Sark-based firm, International Subcontracting Solutions, to handle the payment of their salaries and expenses.

It means the teachers are technically employees of ISS, which claims to work with more than 900 UK recruitment agencies.          

The firm ensures the teachers pay tax and employee national insurance contributions but since it is based offshore, does not pay the employer’s contribution to national insurance.

The BBC said the UK agencies that place the teachers are not paying employers’ national insurance either, leaving a huge tax liability. HM Revenue and Customs warned that schools and councils, or the recruitment agencies, could be forced to cover the shortfall.

Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, told the BBC that the growth of ‘umbrella companies’ such as ISS was ‘the next big UK tax scandal’.

He said: ‘The UK can’t afford this tax loss and it can’t afford so many households being put at tax risk.

This is a scandal waiting to break.’ Crawford Temple, director of tax consultancy Professional Passport, said he wrote to the Treasury in July 2011 to warn about the use of off-shore companies to employ public sector agency workers.

But he told 5 Live Investigates, which airs at 9pm tonight, that ministers failed to respond.

Mr Temple said schools or councils could end up paying out twice as much as they need to.

This is because schools pay a rate to their recruitment suppliers that covers all relevant tax and NI contributions. The rate is the same where the supply teacher is employed via an offshore provider.If HMRC enforces collection of employer’s national insurance and goes to schools for it, they would effectively pay double, he said.

On its website, ISS says it is ‘an employment business, often referred to as an umbrella company’. It adds: ‘ISS is able to provide contractors with a more tax effective salary package than an agency. ISS operates a… tax efficient payroll structure, which allows you to maximise your pay, while maintaining a full UK tax record.’

ISS could not be reached for comment but told the BBC the company is ‘meticulous in complying with HMRC codes on taxes and expenses’. It also said HMRC had no grounds to challenge either its employees or business partners.

In a statement, HMRC said: ‘These kinds of arrangements are not compliant with tax and national insurance legislation and the end client or the employment businesses may be liable for any underpaid tax and national insurance.’
