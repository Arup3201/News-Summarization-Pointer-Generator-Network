Ryan Bader knows Phil Davis is just another road block on his journey to a title shot.

The American is bidding for his fourth successive victory in the Octagon when he faces his countryman in front of 30,000 fans in Sweden on Saturday.

And Bader, who has only ever lost at the highest level, is confident victory will set him up for his best year yet.

'A win against Phil is definitely a step in the right direction,' he told Sportsmail. 'Where I currently stand in the division, for me to get a title shot I need to go through Phil and he is the only thing that I am thinking about right now.

'I'm healthy now and my hand feels great. I'm going out to get this win and that’s exactly what is going to happen. Phil is a great fighter and a win against him will keep my momentum going in 2015.

'I've never been to Sweden. I've been lucky to fight in some really cool places - Japan, Australia and Brazil to name a few - in front of some real great crowds. I'm excited to fight in front of the passionate fans of Sweden and to check out Stockholm.

Bader's most recent victory was a five-round points win over Ovince Saint Preux

'I appreciate the opportunity Joe Silva has given me. The fans in Sweden are amazing and I can't imagine how electric the stadium will be…. I'll be looking forward to feeding off of the crowd and putting on a good show for these fans.

'Phil's an amazing wrestler and he has done a great job in the division utilizing his wrestling. But wrestling is one of my strong points as well. There is a chance that our wrestling will negate each other, but I'm prepared for anything.'

Bader outpointed Rafael Cavalcante and Ovince St. Preux last year but admitted it has taken a year for him to be injury free.

'My hands feel great for the first time in over a year,' he said. 'I broke my hand against [Anthony] Perosh in the first couple minutes of the fight and re-fractured it during camp for the OSP fight. So, I'm ready to stand with Phil, but I’ll be prepared for wherever this fight should go.'

Davis, meanwhile, has won two of his last three fights, including victories over Lyoto Machida and Glover Teixeira.

And he believes he is stronger than Bader across the board.

Davis also enjoyed a good year with his victories including one over Glover Teixeria

'It’s a big stage to get a big win on,' he said. 'It’s definitely special to fight with that many people in the arena but there’s no extra pressure, it’s just like any other fight.

'A win over Bader will build my current win streak, and put me further into that top 5 and that elite group of fighters and closer to the title. I hope that after this win I’ll be close to a title shot but Alex is next in line, but for sure my goal is to get a title shot.

'The fight will go anywhere I want it to go; I will dictate where it goes. If I want to get the takedown, I’ll get the takedown. I’m better than Ryan in all areas.

'I’m keen for a knockout in this fight, I never pick rounds, I just give it my all. I can tell you that it’s going to be one-sided.

'I improve between all my fights, I've definitely been working on my striking but I pride myself in being a tactician. I focus on winning the fight wherever I can.'
