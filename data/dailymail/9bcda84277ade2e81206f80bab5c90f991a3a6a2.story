An Oklahoma mother who evidently didn’t want to be bothered by her 3-year-old twins as she shopped in a cosmetics store left the toddlers in the car in over 90 degree heat.

For forty minutes, Desiree Lynn Bolch shopped inside an Oklahoma City Ulta store as her kids sat strapped in the car.

When Bolch returned, she was greeted by police.

The 35-year-old mother did leave the car running and the air conditioning on, but authorities took her to jail, anyway.

‘They were completely unattended for over half an hour,’ Oklahoma City Police Sergeant Gary Knight explained to KOCO.

‘You really can’t leave your children alone when they’re that small,’ he went on. ‘Particularly for long periods of time.’

The officers at the scene called the Department of Human Services to investigate, according to KOCO.

It was determined that Bolch had neglected her children and she was arrested.

‘Children can get into things. Even if nobody bothers them, oftentimes they can get out of the car seat and get into something they shouldn’t.’

By Monday evening, Bolch was still in jail facing two felony charges of child neglect.

Her children were placed in state custody.
