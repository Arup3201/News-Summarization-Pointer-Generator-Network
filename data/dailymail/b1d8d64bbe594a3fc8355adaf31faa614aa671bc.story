Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has launched a furious tirade against Nottingham Forest over the non-payment of a substantial fee for Britt Assombalonga.

MacAnthony did not name names but took to Twitter to describe a situation he calls a ‘disgrace’ that undermined Peterborough’s efforts to recruit players on transfer deadline day. 

Sportsmail understands the League One club are waiting on a seven-figure sum as part of Forest’s club-record purchase of Assombalonga for £5.5million.  

Darragh MacAnthony has criticised a Nottingham Forest for their outstanding fee on a Peterborough player

Britt Assombalonga was sold to Nottingham Forest last summer for a fee that could rise to £5.5million

Without releasing exact details, the 38-year-old took aim at Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi and called on the Football League to take action. 

It is believed Forest could become subject to a total transfer embargo – banning even loan signings once the window for such moves re-opens next week. 

Forest are currently barred only from bringing in permanent transfers as part of their punishment for financial fair play breaches. 

Writing on Twitter late last night, MacAnthony said: '(sic) Ok Posh fans, there wont be any incoming signings today but that has nothing to do with players having to leave etc, the real reason is due - To a certain championship club failing to make an agreed large payment (not thousands btw) last week on plyr they bought from us. 

Lee Tomlin joined Middlesbrough last summer but MacAnthony wasn't referring to the forward

Nicky Ajose also left Peterborough in the summer, signing for Leeds

'This same club did this to us in August & now again. Truthfully its a disgrace & their chairman is the same. It has put us last minute in - A terrible predicament which I shall now fix & once loan window opens, we shall bring in a couple of players to help the squad.

'Its also a shambles the Football League allow this nonsense to carry on & not for the first time. Im also sure we are not only club who - Its happened to but the knock on effect is outrageous & doesnt help a club like @theposhdotcom thats for sure! 

'I dont like having to share this on twitter but our fans deserve to know why its been a quiet day & i have (given the) other chairman fair warning that- I wouldnt be messed around & that all within the game will know this should he not pay up. Sad thing is that he can afford to!!’
