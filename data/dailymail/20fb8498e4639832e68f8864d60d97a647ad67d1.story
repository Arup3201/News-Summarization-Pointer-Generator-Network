An ex-boyfriend of Tamara Ecclestone has been charged with theft after police probed claims he stole her jewellery.

Omar Khyami, 40, will appear before magistrates next week accused of taking valuables from the multi-millionaire heiress.

The businessman, whose two-and-a-half year relationship with the wealthy socialite ended in acrimony in 2012, was arrested last month.

According to Miss Ecclestone, 30, the allegedly stolen items were given to her by her billionaire father Bernie, the Formula One boss.

She claims she went to the Metropolitan Police after being told that the jewellery was being offered for sale by Khyami.

Mr Khyami, who lives in a flat overlooking London’s Hyde Park, blamed the row over the jewellery on a misunderstanding.

Miss Ecclestone married former City stockbroker Jay Rutland last summer

He said police questioned him over a ‘small piece’ of jewellery worth up to £8,000, but declined to say what it was.

Speaking 
after his arrest, he said: ‘I don’t want to hurt her. Its two years 
since we’ve been together and I don’t know what she wants.’

The
 alleged theft claims follow a High Court ruling that Miss Ecclestone 
was wrong to try to reclaim a £380,000 Lamborghini supercar she gave to 
Khyami as a present.

She
 was ordered to pay more than £20,000 in compensation to two car 
companies which were prevented from selling the vehicle while the case 
was ongoing.

She
 split from Khyami in 2012 following the discovery that he had featured 
in a sex tape but said she did not regret the romance.

In February last year, another of her former boyfriends was jailed for four years for plotting to blackmail her for £200,000.

A
 Met spokesman said: ‘Police in Kensington and Chelsea have charged Omar
 Al Khyami, 40, of Bayswater Road, London with theft in a dwelling.

‘He has been bailed to attend West London Magistrates Court on a date in late July.’

• We have been informed that the Crown Prosecution Service has decided to discontinue the theft charge brought against Mr Khyami.
