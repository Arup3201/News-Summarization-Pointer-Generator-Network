'I couldn't breathe': Chris Richmond suffered burns and bruising on his 
neck after hitting a leash stretched across his path by walkers

A motorcyclist feared he was going to die when two middle-aged walkers garrotted him with a dog lead by stretching it across his path as he rode a motorbike through a field.

Chris Richmond said he was travelling at about 20mph when he rode into the leash, causing burns and bruising to his neck.

Medics at hospital told him he could have been decapitated in the incident, which left him shocked and unable to breathe.

The factory worker, of Newton Heath, Manchester, believes the man and woman holding the lead did so in revenge because he was riding the motorbike where he shouldn't have been.

Police are treating the attack as grievous bodily harm.

The incident happened after Mr Richmond, 23, and two friends approached some teenagers who were riding a green 125cc motorbike on grass in the Failsworth area of the city.

He and his friends asked for a turn on the bike.

He said: 'I remember the woman giving me a dirty look beforehand, as if to say, "You shouldn’t be doing that".

'Perhaps I shouldn’t have been but that was no way to react. You don’t expect that from middle-aged people.

'They could have called the police and they would have moved us on.

'I couldn’t breathe and thought I was going to die.'

Mr Richmond, a father of one, had been out of work for two months but completed an eight-hour factory shift the day after the attack.

Grievous bodily harm: Greater Manchester Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident

He had just been taken on by a jobs agency and said he was desperate to get back to work to support his one-year-old daughter, Remme-Mae, and her mother, Jordane, 21.

He had previously worked for insurance firm Direct Line for five years.

Chris said: 'I was really looking forward to getting back to work.

'I’ve been down the agency to show them my injuries and they were very understanding.

'They were amazed when I told them I went to work on Sunday.'

The woman dog walker was short, had blonde hair and was in her late thirties or early forties.

The man was also in his late thirties or early forties, had dark hair and was about six feet tall.

Greater Manchester Police was unable to comment on the case today.
