She is the bubbly blonde multimillionaire we are more accustomed to seeing posing in her sexiest lingerie.

But Michelle Mone, 41, swapped her bust-boosting bra for a sturdy sports one to spend a day going commando - at a gruelling military training centre.

The brains behind lingerie giant Ultimo was put through her paces when she visited the Royal Marines base 45 Commando RM Condor in Arbroath, Scotland.

Michelle Mone OBE, the CEO of MJM International, paid a visit to the Royal Marine (RM) Condor for a look at what the Royal Marines do

The underwear mogul spent a day with the elite fighting force to get a taste of their punishing training course.

She also paid a visit to the camp's Woodlands Garden, a remembrance garden opened in honour of the unit's fallen comrades.

After a day of exhausting activities, Michelle, 41, spent time with Colour Sergeant Paul 'Baz' Barrett who suffered disabling injuries in Afghanistan from an improvised explosive device (IED).

Michelle said: 'I never anticipated how tough it was going to be. I really was pushed to my limits. These guys are machines and do an amazing job for our country.'

She continued: 'I've never witnessed such extraordinary physical strength, mental resilience and team cohesion. They all deserve as much support as they can get.'

Michelle was left battered and bruised after taking part in target training, tackling the camp's 'death slide', abseiling from 100ft, and participating in a gruelling two-mile gun run, in a bid to raise money to maintain the base remembrance garden.

Michelle was in great spirits, despite recently suffering issues in her personal life.

After 19 years of marriage, her husband Michael - the father of her three children - left her in 2011 and embarked upon a relationship with Samantha Bunn, a close family friend and senior Ultimo employee.

Then, after a bitter divorce that cost Michelle £24 million when she was forced to buy Michael out of the family’s Ultimo lingerie business, he announced he was setting up a rival lingerie firm - with Bunn as his chief designer.

But judging by these photographs, Michelle is fighting fit and happier than ever.
