The world has wanted to develop holograms ever since Princess Leia used it to appear before Luke Skywalker in Star Wars.

Now, more than three decades later, the hologram could be edging closer to reality with a gadget that allows you to view projected 3D images in space, from any vantage point.

The technology, dubbed ‘Help Me Obi’, has been created by a pair of Scottish artists who claim to be able to project 3D objects as large as 30cm (12 inches).

While holograms are increasingly being used in theatres and gigs, they are currently 2D and can only be viewed correctly from a certain angle.

This technology, however, is different. It has been eight years in development and is the work of Carsluith-based artists Chris Helson and Sarah Jackets.

Miss Jackets is quick to point out that the system is not actually a 3D hologram.

'Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope sparked our imaginations of what might be possible in the future by showing R2-D2 and Chewbacca playing a holographic chess-style game

‘We use the term holographic to help to describe it because there is nothing else like it, it's a device that produces 360 degree video objects,’ she said.

‘It exploits persistence of vision, video projection and a number of engineering inventions.

‘Beyond that, we can't really tell you much more because it's going through a patent process.’

So far the system displays a number of moving objects which includes the couple’s baby son at a few days old, a jellyfish swimming in air and the Nasa Voyager 1 probe.

'Every element of making was a huge challenge,' they said.

'The first version we made was quite abstract and flickered heavily, it was a bit like the very first TV, not easy to see the image but enough to see the possibilities.' 

Referencing Princess Leia’s iconic appearance in Star Wars (left) as a 3D moving holographic message, Help me Obi (right) is an investigation of remote relationships, intimacy and dislocation

'When you actually stand there with them floating in front of you they have a life that you connect to in a very different way than you would with a film or video, or even a 3D film.'

'This is what we mean by intimacy and dislocation, that your connection to voyager, the iconic messenger from earth, and the ideas it embodies become physical,' the artists added.

But they hope their technology can also be used for practical applications, such as creating 3D drawings and computer designs.

The system is currently in its prototype stage, although the designers said they may commercialise it in the future.

Help Me Obi will be on display at the Alt-w exhibition, through which it won an award, at the Edinburgh Art Festival from until August 31.

It may have taken 36 years but the iconic holographic chess game from 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope' just took a step closer to reality thanks to a pair of augmented and virtual reality specs.

The castAR system uses a pair of glasses fitted with a micro-projector on each lens that beams images in 3D onto a specially-designed flat surface.

These images can then be moved and interacted with using a remote control wand.

'CastAR is a projected augmented reality system that displays holographic-like 3D projections right in front of you,' said the system's Washington-based maker Technical Illusions.

CastAR's system is made of a pair of glasses and a surface. The frames of the glasses are fitted with two micro-projectors - one for each eye.

Each projector beams a perspective view of a stereoscopic 3D image onto the retro-reflective surface. A tiny camera, fitted between the projectors, scans for infrared identification markers placed on this surface.

The camera uses these markers to precisely track a player's head position and orientation in the physical world. The so-called Magic Wand can be used as a joystick and a '3D input device.'

The handheld part of the wand has buttons, a trigger, and a thumb stick. The wand also tracks its own movement in 3D space, allowing players to interact with virtual environments.

The castAR system uses a pair of glasses, pictured, fitted with a projector on each lens. Each micro-projector receives a video stream via a HDMI connection and beams these images in 3D onto retro-reflective sheeting. The images can then be moved and interacted with using a remote control wand
