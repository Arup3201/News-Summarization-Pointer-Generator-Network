Theo Walcott wants a significant pay rise if he is to sign a new Arsenal contract.

Talks over a new deal have begun with the Arsenal forward nearing the final year of his contract.

The pacy forward currently earns in the region of £90,000-per-week - but Walcott will ask for a sum significantly north of £100,000-per-week before agreeing to an extension.

It remains to be seen whether the Gunners will meet the demands but his current position in Arsene Wenger’s plans may provide an indication.

Since returning from a long-term injury, Walcott has struggled for regular football, with the likes of Olivier Giroud, Danny Welbeck, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all vying for a slot in Wenger’s four attacking positions.

Arsenal top-earners Sanchez and Ozil earn in the region of £140,000-per-week.

The Emirates Stadium are unlikely to offer Walcott anything near that amount, particularly given his lack of games.

His wage demands could lead to another long drawn out contract saga, similar to the discussions for his existing deal which nearly saw Walcott leave before he signed his last contract in January 2013.

Liverpool and Manchester City will be monitoring Walcott’s situation closely ahead of a potential summer move.

Walcott will be hoping to earn a similar amount to star man Alexis Sanchez on £140,000-per-week
