We may not all possess her Victoria's Secret physique and model looks but we can take a page out of Candice Swanepoel's book when it comes to fashion thanks to @70sbabes.

The Instagram account, which has more than 18,000 followers, is dedicated to vintage pictures of 70s boho beauties dressed in flares, peasant tops and short shorts, including all featured in this article.

And the supermodel, 26, loves to reference the retro style feed when it comes to her own wardrobe choices - buying high-cut jeans in an attempt to emulate Farrah Fawcett, and even feathering her hair.

All of Candice's jeans are high waisted because she thinks they make her look like Farrah Fawcett (pictured)

The 70s were a huge fashion story for designers this AW14/15 season, and @70sbabes reveals how the looks began.

Speaking to Into The Gloss, Candice said: 'Most of my style inspiration comes from the 70s and the 80s. 

'There's this Instagram account called 70sbabes that I love to reference and repost on my own account.

'All of my jeans are high waisted because I think they make me look like Farrah Fawcett - I'll try to feather my hair, too. But I also love the big curls of the '80s.

'My mom was an aerobics teacher back then and she permed her hair and wore these huge earrings and high-cut thong leotards. She had the best style.'

Candice reveals her low-key, relaxed style translates from fashion to beauty.

'I don't wear a ton of makeup when I'm not working,' she says, 'but beautiful eyebrows are really important. 

'You can have nothing on as long as your eyebrow shape is good. But I do love makeup and Youtube tutorials and all that.'

And the Victoria's Secret Angel reveals her favourite mascara is a Boots staple we can all afford.

'If I go to a festival or something, I really go for it and create a really dramatic eye. Maxfactor mascara is the best for that. I'll apply it really thick so it looks like I'm wearing false eyelashes. I swear by that stuff.'
