West Bromwich Albion are close to completing a £4.75million deal for Wigan Athletic winger Callum McManaman.

Negotiations are ongoing over a transfer for Tony Pulis’s number one target and the Championship side are believed to be willing to accept less than £5m. It had been thought a fee close to £6m would be needed.

Both parties are working towards a deal and it could be completed within the next 24 hours. Personal terms are not believed to present an issue.

Tony Pulis wants at least one wide man at West Brom and McManaman is his top target

Pulis is desperate to bring in at least one quick wide player this window. 

After beating Birmingham in the FA Cup he said: 'There are certain weaknesses in the team, unbalanced in a way that we have to sort it out. 

'We have to put certain things in place so we can be good in possession and out of possession. It’s a massive ten days for the football club, I hope and pray things drop for us.’
