This award-winning image of two Palestinian children killed in an Israeli missile strike being carried to their funeral captured the judge's attention at the World Press Photo of the Year.

But since then the photographer Paul Hansen has been accused of manipulating the striking image by splicing together three different photos.

Now after a thorough investigation examining the RAW file and the JPEG image entered in the competition, the World Press Photo have announced the photograph was not faked.

Verdict: The winning image of the 2013 World Press Photo by Paul Hansen was not faked, it has been announced

'We have reviewed the RAW image, as 
supplied by World Press Photo, and the resulting published JPEG image. 
It is clear that the published photo was retouched with respect to both 
global and local color and tone.

Beyond this, however, we find no 
evidence of significant photo manipulation or compositing.'

In response to the damning allegations being cleared, Mr Hansen, who has worked for the daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter since 2000, told MailOnline: 'I feel relieved that three independent forensic/computer experts in two different countries have made a clear statement.

'The photo have of course also been judged and examined by four different international photo-jurys with industry- experts.

'This is my most examined photograph ever. Yesterday was a very taxing day and perhaps some questions regarding the origin of these accusations should be asked.'

The claims were made Neal Krawetz, a forensic analyst and published by 
Extremetech.com.

The website claimed 'the photo itself is almost certainly a composite of three different photos, with various regions spliced together from each of the images, and then further manipulation to illuminate the mourners’ faces.'

Allegations: Paul Hansen had been accused of manipulating the striking image by splicing together three different photos

But Mr Hansen, a Swedish photographer based in Stockholm has always vigorously denied manipulating the images.'

Mr Hansen’s shot won top prize in both the spot news single photograph category and the overall competition.

The photo shows the bodies
of two-year-old Suhaib Hijazi and his elder brother Muhammad, almost 
four, are carried by their uncles to a mosque for their funeral, in Gaza
City.

The children were killed when their 
house was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike on 19 November. The strike 
also killed their father, Fouad, and severely injured their mother and 
four other siblings.

'The strength of the pictures lies in the way it contrasts the anger and sorrow of the adults with the innocence of the children,' said jury member Mayu Mohanna of Peru. 'It's a picture I will not forget.'

When he received the award Mr Hansen said: 'This prize is the highest honour you can get in the profession,' Hansen said. 'I’m very happy, but also very sad. The family lost two children and the mother is unconscious in a hospital.'

'These situations are so visually complex,' he added. 'It’s difficult to convey the emotions, to translate what is happening. The light is harsh and there are a lot of people.

'But in the alley the light bounced off the walls, so I thought this is a place where you can see that it’s a procession. ... You get the depth in the image, and the bouncing light.'
