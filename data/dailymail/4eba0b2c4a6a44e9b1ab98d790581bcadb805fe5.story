Allegations: Bo Xilai, who hoped to join the Chinese Communist Party's politburo in Beijing, has been accused of being involved in the death of Mr Heywood

The Chinese politician whose wife is accused of the alleged murder of British businessman Neil Heywood drew up three different cover stories for the planned killing of his own police chief, it has been claimed.

Bo Xilai, then a rising star of the Chinese Communist Party who hoped to join its powerful politburo in Beijing, was apparently trying to prevent the police chief, Wang Lijun, from revealing that Mr Heywood had been murdered.

Mr Wang took shelter at the US consulate in Chengdu in February, where he told diplomats that Mr Heywood was poisoned by Mr Bo's wife, Gu Kailai.

The police chief reportedly told them Ms Gu had confessed to the killing.

The
 latest allegations against Mr Bo suggest that he was much more deeply 
involved in silencing Mr Wang than was previously thought.

Hong
 Kong magazine New Way has claimed in an investigation that Mr Bo drew 
up three false explanations to hide the planned killing of Mr Wang, 
having already allegedly arrested and tortured several members of the 
police chief's inner circle.

Jiang
 Weiping, a Chinese journalist now living in exile in Canada after being
 jailed for reporting on Mr Bo, said details of the plot had been 
confirmed to him by sources in Chongqing, the city where Mr Heywood was 
allegedly murdered.

Mr 
Jiang told the Sunday Telegraph that Mr Bo invented scenarios to explain
 Mr Wang's death and to play down any suggestions that he was involved.

The first story was to blame the killing on the local mafia as revenge for police efforts to fight crime in the city.

The second was to pretend Mr Wang had committed suicide to escape being punished for corruption.

The third fake explanation was suicide caused by Mr Wang's depression.

Mr Bo opted for the third 
explanation, the magazine claimed, because the first was too difficult 
and the second would undermine his push for national power.

His aides are said to have forged Mr Wang's medical history to suggest the police chief suffered from depression.

They
 are also believed to have leaked a supposed hospital certificate on the
 internet in an attempt to spread the word that Mr Wang was mentally 
unstable.

The magazine 
claimed that five members of Mr Wang's circle were interrogated - with 
two of them dying under torture - and others were put under 
surveillance.

Mr Wang became aware that his life was in danger and went to the US consulate, the report continued.

Chris
 Johnson, the former chief analyst of the CIA, said: 'It does seem that 
his intention was not to defect but to find a safe haven because he 
realised that the gig was up in Chongqing and he needed to get out of 
there as quickly as possible.

'For Bo's enemies, Wang is golden. It certainly won't just be Neil Heywood's death that he is telling them about.'

The new allegations are the latest of many to emerge since Mr Heywood, 41, died in suspicious circumstances six months ago.

The body of the Old Harrovian business ‘fixer’, who had known the Bo family for a decade, was found in a hotel in Chongqing last November.

It has been alleged that he was murdered apparently to stop him disclosing secrets of Mr Bo's wealth transferred out of China.

Ms
 Gu, who had allegedly had an affair with Mr Heywood, is said to have 
told Mr Wang that she was in the hotel room during the ‘gruesome’ 
poisoning.

Mr Wang reportedly told U.S. diplomats 
that Mr Heywood was held down in a Chongqing hotel room in November and 
forced to drink cyanide.

Mr Heywood had, before his death, been raising cash to build an £80million shopping centre dedicated to British goods.  

Mrs
 Gu is alleged to have started an affair with him after she was denied 
‘any normal passion’ from her husband, said Wang Kang, a Chongqing scholar 
with contacts inside Mr Bo's circle.

They
 are even said to have visited Britain together and occasionally shared 
an apartment in the seaside resort of Bournemouth, which was registered 
to Mrs Gu.

Mr Heywood's death ended the political 
career of Mr Bo, who was sacked from his post after it was claimed he 
had wire-tapped senior Communist Party leaders.

The wire-tapping network was reportedly discovered when anti-corruption 
officials detected a phone call made to Chinese President Hu Jintao was 
being bugged.

Mr Bo's son Guagua read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Oxford's Balliol College.

He later studied at Harvard University in the U.S. but is now believed to be in hiding.

Bo Guagua has tried to play down reports that he enjoyed a playboy lifestyle at Oxford.

He said his academic record was ‘solid’ and he had earned a string of top grades.
