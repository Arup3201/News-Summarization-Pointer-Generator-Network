Asim Taylor, 35, owes nearly $100,000 in such payments.

The 9th District Court Circuit of Appeals on Monday made its decision, upholding a ruling made in January 2013 by Lorain County Probate Judge James Walther against Taylor.

Taylor’s attorney, Doug Merrill, said he 
plans to appeal the decision to the Ohio Supreme Court as he has 
previously argued that the order violates Taylor’s right to reproduce.

He said the only way his client can guarantee compliance with Walther’s 
order, which requires Taylor to make all reasonable efforts to avoid 
impregnating a woman,' is by abstaining from sex.

'Indeed, we have little to go on other
 than what the trial court said in its journal entries, which is itself 
limited,' Appeals Judge Carla Moore wrote in the majority decision for the appellate court. 'We 
therefore have no choice in this case but to presume the regularity of 
the community control sanctions and to affirm.'

When Walther imposed the order in 2003, he called it 'a matter of common sense and personal responsibility.'

He told the Chronicle-Telegram on Monday that the decision allows him to level similar sanctions against defendants in case that are similar to Taylor's.

Still, Walther was not completely satisfied with the appellate decision.

'I’m happy they upheld me, but I’m disappointed they didn’t decide on the merits,' he said.

The high court in Ohio has previously ruled in such a case. In 2004, it struck down a similar order, though on technical ground. A lower court judge had neglected to include a way to have the order lifted.

Walther’s order, however, addressed that issue by stating that the order would be lifted if Taylor could show he was taking responsibility for supporting his children, Judge Donna Carr, who delved into the issue more fully than her colleagues in a concurring opinion for the appellate court.
