Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League and Football League this weekend, including why Diego Costa is the perfect striker for Chelsea...

1) Diego Costa’s shuffle of feet and close range shot against Leicester was his second close range finish in two Premier League games so far.

That’s good news for Chelsea fans after their struggles to find a consistent forward last season, but even better is that there’s more to the £30million new recruit than just a bit of goal poaching.

Of the 27 he hit for Atletico Madrid in last season’s La Liga, only nine were from ten yards or less.

2) QPR’s defensive system relies on a midfield man to protect the back three, and nobody could fault Joey Barton for effort as the 7.5miles he covered was only beaten at White Hart Lane by Christian Eriksen’s 7.8 miles.

But while 31-year-old Barton might have been chasing the ball he didn’t win it often enough – coming out on top in only four tackles during 90 minutes.

Effort: Joey Barton ran 7.5 miles in QPR's 4-0 loss to Spurs, but he won just four tackles during the game

3) If Manchester United paid £27million up front for Luke Shaw and Arsenal shelled out £16million for Calum Chambers then the £6million Newcastle paid for Dutch full back Daryl Janmaat looks an absolute bargain.

The 25-year-old who played in five of Holland’s World Cup games looked outstanding against Aston Villa both in defence and going forward – setting up a chance from which Emmanuel Riviere should have scored.

He also showed he’ll be a major threat at set pieces, winning five headers as Newcastle used him as an aerial target both at corners and free kicks.

Value for money: £6million buy Daryl Janmaat has looked an excellent acquisition so far for Newcastle

4) At a time when most goalkeepers are happy to punch the ball, Lukasz Fabianski has brought security to Swansea’s defence with his willingness to come out and take crosses to ease pressure.

The 29-year-old Pole, an inspired free transfer signing by manager Garry Monk, caught the ball seven times in the win over Burnley, and six during last week’ s triumph at Old Trafford.

In contrast the most catches made in a game by last season’s number one Michel Vorm was the four he took at home to Norwich in December, and his average in 26 appearances was just 1.19.

Safe hands: Lukasz Fabianski has been excellent so far as Swansea have won both their opening games

5) One talent waiting to be found by whoever takes charge of Crystal Palace is Welsh midfielder Jonathan Williams who spent the end of last season on loan at Ipswich to get game time after recovering from injuries.

The tiny 20-year-old, just 5ft 6ins tall, offered Selhurst Park home fans one of the few consolations in a 19 minute cameo when he replaced Barry Bannan against West Ham.

He found a team mate with a pass on every one of the eight occasions when he got on the ball.

6) Steve Bruce hasn’t taken long to get the hang of rotation in his adventures in Europe - goalkeeper Allan McGregor is now the only Hull player to have appeared for all 90 minutes in each of their five fixtures so far.

Centre-half James Chester had been the only outfield player in that category until his red card against Stoke yesterday.

That’s already a big change in policy from last season when six of his Hull’s outfield players appeared in a total of 36 games or more.

7) Newly promoted Wolves must have cursed their luck when the Championship fixture list pitted them against all three of last year’s relegated Premier League sides in their first four games.

But what looked a tough start has turned out to be a doddle – the injury time Mark Hudson own goal that brought a 1-0 win against Cardiff made it a hat-trick of three-pointers.

Ironically the only game to spoil the perfect start was a 1-0 defeat at Rotherham who like Kenny Jackett’s team won promotion from League One last season.

8) Felix Magath never once named an unchanged side as Fulham crashed out of the Premier League last year and his status as English football’s new Tinkerman hasn’t changed much in the Championship.

After the opening day defeat at Ipswich he named four new players for the next game, swapped another five in midweek against Wolves. Ryan Williams for Mark Fotheringham was the only change before the 5-1 hammering at Derby, but you suspect that by then the damage had been done.

9) David Martin, son of West Ham legend and now broadcaster Alvin, is battling to be fit in time to face Manchester United for MK Dons in the glamour tie of Tuesday night’s Capital One Cup programme.

That means former Irish Under 21 keeper Ian McLoughlin is likely to continue as stand-in for Karl Robinson’s League One side.

But it’s not good news for Louis van Gaal as he tries to avoid adding a Cup upset to his list of problems – McLoughlin kept his second clean sheet in a row as Dons held Coventry to a 0-0 draw.

10) Paul Mullin played in the same Liverpool youth team as Raheem Sterling, but while his mate went on to star in England’s World Cup team he found himself released after two years at Huddersfield without a first team game.

The 19-year-old, a slimly built striker with pace and a shot in both feet, is fighting back.

He marked his debut a week ago by coming on with six minutes left and scoring the winner against Newport, and his first start by getting the two goals against Cambridge that leaves Jim Bentley’s side as the only team in the Football League with four wins from four.
