Councils will today call for a change in the law to prevent them having to sell voters’ personal details to junk mail firms.

Local authorities have come under fire from privacy campaigners for effectively aiding the junk mail barons who bombard families with unwanted leaflets and letters.

Details from the electoral roll are routinely sold on to direct marketing firms, estate agents, fast food outlets and others who contribute to Britain’s annual mountain of three billion items of junk mail.

Critics point out that cash-strapped councils make thousands of pounds a year by selling on voters’ details for as little as 15p a go.

But, in a significant intervention today, the Local Government Association (LGA) calls for a change in the law to bring an end to the practice.

The umbrella body says councils are obliged by law to sell on data from the electoral roll under the terms of the Representation of the People Act 2002.

The organisation claims many councils do not even make enough money from the process to cover their costs. And it warns the situation is even deterring some people from signing up to the electoral roll, leaving them unable to vote.

Peter Fleming, of the LGA, said: ‘Councils resent having to pass the electoral roll onto direct marketing companies.

'Junk mailers and cold callers are a pet hate for many of us. It demeans our democracy for the voters’ details to be sold off as a tool to help direct marketing firms make money.

‘In some cases people have not signed up to vote because they are concerned about their privacy being compromised.

‘Scrapping the open register would spare millions from being bombarded with junk mail and would remove a hurdle which stands in the way of our efforts to sign people up to vote.’

Under the existing law, councils are required to compile two versions of the electoral register. Details of everyone entitled to vote are included on a ‘full’ version of the register, which is not for sale to businesses.

But a second ‘open’ version of the register is also created containing the same names and addresses, except for those who have opted out. This contains some 28 million names, which junk mail firms can purchase in electronic form for as little as £1.50 per 1,000 entries.

The electoral register is available for anyone to inspect. But by selling on details in electronic form councils make it easy for junk mail firms to send out thousands of unwanted items at the push of a button.

A study by the civil liberties group Big Brother Watch last year found that 300 councils had sold on information to some 2,700 companies and individuals over the previous five years.

Daniel Nesbitt, research director at Big Brother Watch, said: "The sale of the edited electoral register has to stop and the LGA is absolutely right to say so.

‘Registering to vote should be a basic part of our democratic freedoms, instead the practice of forcing councils to sell our personal details to anyone and everyone has left people confused about who can get hold of their private information.

‘The existence of the edited register is waste of everyone's time, councils don't benefit from selling it on and it leaves residents drowning in huge volumes of junk mail, there is no need to keep it and it should be abolished as a matter of urgency.'
