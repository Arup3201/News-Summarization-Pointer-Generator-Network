Jewellery, clothes and treasured possessions strewn across the floor filmed on a policeman's headcam show the devastation left behind by burglars after they rifled their way through a family home.

The footage, taken by a police officer hours after the crime, has been released to combat a suspected gang of serial thieves who took jewellery with rich sentimental value.

It was shot in a detached family home in Waterlooville, Hampshire - an area which has fallen victim to more than 30 burglaries in just one month.

Scattered: Possessions strewn across the floor of a home in Waterlooville, Hampshire, in a crime scene video

Aftermath: It is one of the first times a police force has ever released footage shot by officers after a raid

Hampshire Police released clip after the burglary was the 31st in Havant and Waterlooville in a month.

It begins by showing a smashed window with glass scattered over a bathroom floor.

As the officers move through the family home they find the contents of drawers, cupboards and wardrobes strewn across the floor in almost every room.

Detective Sergeant Steve Kelly said: 'This footage demonstrates the impact of being burgled. It really can be devastating for a homeowner to arrive home and find their property turned upside down.'

A police spokesman said: 'They're all linked through what's been taken and the modus operandi, which is breaking in at the back of the property.

Strewn: Empty boxes and clothes were spread all over the floors of the detached home in Hampshire

Mess: The burglars, thought to be serial criminals, left cupboards open in their search for valuable jewellery

The footage was filmed on a camera clipped to the front of a police officer's stab-proof vest, allowing the force to capture the scene of the crime immediately afterwards.

A police spokesman added: 'A lot of our officers wear these cameras and this is the first time we've issued footage as part of a media appeal.'

The spate of burglaries have all happened overnight or in the evening when it is dark.

Police have urged residents to lock all doors and windows, set burglar alarms and make it look as though someone is at home by switching on the lights.
