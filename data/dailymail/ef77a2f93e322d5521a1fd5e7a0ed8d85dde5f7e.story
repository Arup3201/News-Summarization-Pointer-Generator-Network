This could have been avoided. If Roy Hodgson had said he wanted to give Adam Lallana the chance to build on his eye-catching efforts against San Marino, we would have been none the wiser about Raheem Sterling’s fatigue.

Every word the England manager says is scrutinised. I can see where Hodgson was coming from but an issue has been created that both men could have done without. Had Hodgson explained he wanted to use Sterling for an impact – which he had, by winning the decisive free-kick against Estonia – there would be no quarrel.

Now, though, Sterling is in the spotlight and contending with questions such as ‘how can a 19-year-old be tired?’ but those who believe he has made a mistake saying he wasn’t in the right condition to play for England are not looking at the full picture.

It doesn’t matter whether you are 19 or 29, if you play nine games in a month, like Raheem did in September, it will leave a mark on you physically. So, in some respects, he has been brave to confront the issue and explain his concerns to Hodgson.

Would I have ever done it? No. I feared if I missed a game, someone would come in and take my place. I also never wanted to give managers an excuse to leave me out, so there were times when I played in games I shouldn’t have done.

Was it the right thing to do? No. Injuries are what I would mask but I remember a game at Bolton in September 2006 when I was shattered, having been to the World Cup in Germany. We lost 2-0, one of the goals came from a cross into the box. I tried to jump for a header but had nothing in my legs. Had I been right, I know I would have got my head to the ball first.

As a central defender, you can find a way of getting through a game, you don’t have to operate at the rapier pace that Raheem moves with. His game is based around high intensity sprinting and he needs sharpness to go past opponents, with or without the ball.

We want Raheem to thrill us, to be an exciting figure for many years to come. We don’t want him to get to 25 and his best form be a thing of the past. If he is managed properly now and looks after himself, he won’t suffer burn out like another former Liverpool and England teenage prodigy.

A few weeks ago, I spent some time with Sir Alex Ferguson. During our conversation, he remembered how, in 1997, Michael Owen and I had played at the Under-20 World Cup in Malaysia. Michael came back and went straight into Liverpool’s first team at the start of the season.

By contrast, the United players in that England squad – Ronnie Wallwork and John Curtis – were both given a month off to recover but Michael was on a rapid upward curve and at the end of that campaign, he set the World Cup finals in France alight.

Michael wanted to play in every game for club and country but, in October 1998, Gerard Houllier and Roy Evans – in their brief reign as Liverpool’s joint managers – decided to rest him for a UEFA Cup game against Valencia. Michael wasn’t happy and said in an interview “I’ll rest when I’m 40”.

That comment went down well with supporters and ex-players but was he right? No. Michael played far too much for Liverpool and England too early, never getting a summer off to recharge physically or mentally. Was it a coincidence that he suffered a serious hamstring injury in April 1999?

Raheem is becoming like Michael, with stature and his pace and his importance to club and country at such an early stage of his career but there have been signs over the last few weeks that such a punishing spell is beginning to catch up with him.

He may have only played two games at the World Cup but Sterling was training every day in stifling conditions, having just come off a season in which he had been a key figure in Liverpool’s title charge. After three weeks off, he then went to the USA for Liverpool’s pre-season tour.

Don’t underestimate what an impact that schedule will have had on him, physically and mentally. Figures back that up. Between May 30, 2013 and October 13, 2013, Raheem had played 615 minutes of football. In the same period this year, that figure had shot up to 1682 minutes.

Hodgson and Brendan Rodgers will talk about how to handle him going forward but, naturally, they are going to want to use him when they can as he is a match-winner. That’s why he played against Middlesbrough in the League Cup. Liverpool’s poor start in the league meant Rodgers needed his quality.

Liverpool could not have afforded to be on the end of a giant-killing that night, so the plan would have been to get the game won and get Sterling off early. As it was, things never went to plan and he subjected to 120 minutes. Since then, his performances have been notably lacking sparkle.

Sterling retweeted those criticising him online before writing: 'Now listening to... Excuse me for being human'

His importance at Anfield is vital and that is why, at the end of last season, Rodgers called him “the best young player in Europe”. He was dazzling in that spell but that was a spell when Liverpool were only playing one game a week.

This is the first time he has played consistently in games of this pressure and will take some adjustment. But If he is become one of the top players in the world, he will ultimately have to get used to an unrelenting schedule.
