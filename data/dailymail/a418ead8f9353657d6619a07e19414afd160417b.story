New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's tenure at City Hall is set to end this November but the billionaire is not yet ready to climb down from his bully pulpit.

The business mogul turned politician has launched a gun safety crusade in the U.S. and is bankrolling his very own super PAC to support candidates across the nation championing his pet issue.

The Democrat turned RINO, Republican in Name Only, turned Independent has taken on the gun lobby after the tragedies in Aurora, Colo. and Newtown, Conn. by pouring more than $10 million so far into his Independence USA PAC.

Though he insists he does support the constitutional right to bear arms, with an estimated fortune of $25 billion at his disposal, the 71-year-old appears to be gearing up to take on the National Rifle Association.

Call to arms: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg (center in October) holds an AR-15 assault rifle retrieved in a weapons bust. Bloomberg is calling for an assault weapons ban and universal background checks

Campaign: Bloomberg (left in 2007) co-founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns in 2006 to mobilize city leaders to fight gun violence

Bloomberg's campaign for gun control began in 2006, when he joined forces with Boston Mayor Tom Menino to establish Mayor's Against Illegal Guns or MAIG.

The executive has donated more than $3 million to the advocacy group and hosted numerous summits on what cities can do to curb gun violence.

Under his leadership the group has grown from a core of 15 members to a movement of over 900 mayors from major U.S. cities.

The group's platform includes calls to 
ban assault-style weapons, execute universal background checks on gun 
buyers and push for increased law enforcement resources to fight gun 
trafficking.

In October 2012, Bloomberg decided to add to the organization's arsenal with the creation of a political action committee that could offer financial support to candidates across the U.S. who support stricter gun control measures.

In November, Bloomberg's PAC provided funding for a total of seven races across the country for candidates running for both House and Senate seats and even one contender for the Attorney General in Pennsylvania. 

Following the tragic shooting in December at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that left 26 dead, Bloomberg stepped up his campaign to mobilize a grassroots effort.

He gathered a bevy of Hollywood A-Listers to star in a one minute TV commercial to 'Demand a Plan,' sponsored by MAIG, and advocate for Congress to move quickly on tighter gun regulation.

Bloomberg's group also produced a 30 second TV spot that aired during the Super Bowl.

This February, thanks to more than $2 million in funding from Bloomberg's PAC, anti-NRA candidate Robin Kelly was elected to fill Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.'s Congressional seat in Illinois.

Kelly, who made gun regulation a top issue on her agenda, successfully beat her five contenders namely Debbie Halvorson, a Democrat who earned an 'A' score from the NRA from her past term in Congress, who was targeted by Bloomberg's PAC.

Gun lobby: David Keene, president of the National Rifle Association, has downplayed the effectiveness of Bloomberg's campaign for increased gun regulation

'The mayor has been clear he will used 
his resources to support common sense reforms,' a spokesman for 
Independence USA, Stefan Friedman, told the MailOnline.

Maintaining that the group does support the Second Amendment of the U.S. constitution, Mr Friedman said the mayor's campaign for gun safety is not a 'zero sum proposition.'

'You can be for the second amendment and not for assault weapons. You can be for the second amendment and not for background checks.'

But the NRA is crying foul and has labeled the New Yorker a 'fanatic, anti-gun activist.'

Speaking at a Salt Lake City hunting expo on February 23, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre warned about the 'secret agenda' behind universal background checks.

'This is not universal background checks. This is universal registration of your firearms,' he said, claiming registration is the government's first step before they seek to confiscate weapons.

NRA President David Keene has also spoken critically about Bloomberg's effort and has suggested the mayor's effort won't have a long lasting impact. 

In regards to Kelly's election after the influx of cash from Bloomberg's PAC, he said, 'this
 proves nothing other than that in a four or five person primary, if you
 spend $2 million you outta be able to get enough votes for your 
candidate to win,' he said on February 27, speaking on the NRA's Cam & Co. news show.

'It's only meaningful
 in that you have a fanatic, anti-gun activist who happens to be the 
mayor of New York and happens to have billions of 
dollars who has indicated his willingness to spend up to a billion 
dollars to get his way.'

'This is indicative of nothing more than the depth of this man's wealth and his willingness to spend it.'

But the mayor has no plans of stopping anytime soon.

Without elaborating on the PAC's next move, Mr Friedman said 'geography is not really an issue' as they survey the landscape for like minded candidates pushing for common sense reforms.
