France is the most popular ski destination for Brits this winter accounting for a staggering 87 per cent of all enquiries. 

Austria and Switzerland remain popular, although demand for both is down on last year while Andorra has seen a significant hike in popularity with enquiries up 32 per cent on last season. 

Morzine is the number one choice for Brits and demand for this resort is up 16 per cent on last year, in research by Owners Direct.

Val Thorens, Meribel and La Plagne have also experienced a big leap in demand versus last season, whereas Chamonix has seen demand fall by 23 per cent and it has dropped from position four to position nine in the 'top 10'. 

'France is the clear winner among British skiers this season,' says Erica Chang, Senior Regional Director, Owners Direct. 

'Demand for ski accommodation in France has risen year-on-year and our top ten ski resorts are all French.'

Most popular countries for a ski holiday based on no. of enquiries between January and October 2014 for travel between December 2014 and March 2015

Figures from the holiday home specialist and currency provider, Caxton FX, have revealed that demand for ski holidays is climbing high, reporting that the volume of currency purchased for ski-related trips is up 59 per cent on last year.

'British skiers are opting for the more affordable eurozone resorts, over the US and Switzerland, with the number of US dollars purchased for ski this year down on 2013,' said James Hickman, managing director of Caxton FX.

Figures for US Dollars are reportedly down 73 per cent on last year and the number of Swiss Francs bought this year is down 58 per cent since 2012.

'In contrast, the volume of Euros purchased for ski-related trips is up 64 per cent, year on year. Brits really are making the most of being closer to home where the pound has significantly strengthened against the Euro, adds Mr Hickman.' 

Chamonix has fallen from position four to nine and a 23 per cent drop in bookings for 2015

Owners Direct is putting the heightened demand for snowy escapes down to the balmy temperatures that the UK has enjoyed this year, particularly during the hazy autumn, which has made holidaymakers crave the crisp chill of the slopes even more than usual. 

Its figures have also revealed that December is the most popular month for travellers to take a ski holiday, accounting for almost half of the total enquiries for the 2014/15 season, followed by February4, with many opting to take their ski break during the school holidays.

'Holiday homes are particularly appealing for families, whose travel dates are often restricted to the Christmas and February half-term school holidays, because they offer a more affordable way to enjoy a ski holiday than a hotel or catered chalet and allow the whole family to stay together,' added Ms Chang.

Owners Direct has more than 3,400 ski properties to rent this season, spanning France, Austria, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Andorra, Italy and Finland.
