Standing at a statuesque 6ft 2in Stas Fedyanin looks totally at ease strutting down catwalks and posing in glamorous shoots.

Clothed in dresses and high heels, with long hair, a willowy frame and even a hint of cleavage it is almost impossible to believe that the model is in fact, a male.

The 18-year-old Russian is the latest androgynous model to make waves in the fashion industry, with his story made all the more unusual because he regularly dates women, and is in all other ways a normal red blooded male.

Stas is represented by Dopamin Models, a German male model agency, but works almost exclusively as a female model

Stas says he has got used to walking in heels and that despite his delicate features and lean body, there is still a fair bit of preparation involved in turning him into a female

The model, who can now command up to £2,000 for a single shoot, says he has no problems finding a date

Joining the realms of Andrej Pejic, who has become a favourite with the world's top womenswear designers, Stas says he has got used to walking in heels and that despite his delicate features and lean body, there is still a fair bit of preparation involved in turning him into a female.

Speaking to Closer, he says: ‘I’ve learnt to walk in six-inch heels by watching female models, I tuck my penis into a G-string when I’m modelling swimwear or underwear and I often wear hair extensions.’

Stas also says that while there are now a few ‘gender neutral’ models in the fashion world he has yet to meet another straight male that works as a female.

He can now command up to £2,000 for a single shoot, says he has no problems finding a female date.

In order to keep up his feminine appearance Stas avoids the gym to prevent developing masculine muscles and also keeps up regular leg and bikini line waxes

Stas, who stands at 6ft 2in, reportedly weighs just 99lb or 7 stone

‘Like any man, I enjoy working with gorgeous women and I’ve dated a few of the girls I’ve worked with. They don’t have a problem with me dressing as a woman- in fact some of them find it a turn on. I go for blondes and I like curvy girls.’

Reportedly weighing just 99lb, or just over 7st, Stas is represented by Dopamin Models, a German male model agency, but works almost exclusively as a female model.

In order to keep up his feminine appearance he avoids the gym to prevent developing masculine muscles and also keeps up regular leg and bikini line waxes, often finding himself attracting male attention.

However Stas insists that off the catwalk he leads much the same life as any other man, enjoy football, beer, and spending time with friends.

‘Although I model as a woman, I am all man between the sheets,’ he says.
