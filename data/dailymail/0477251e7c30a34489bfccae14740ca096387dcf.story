Fierce winds, huge waves and torrential rain could sweep Britain as the remnants of Hurricane Bertha strike the country. There is a 60 per chance that the tail-end of the storm, currently heading across the Atlantic towards Europe, will hit the UK on Sunday morning.

If it does come our way it could result in flash flooding as three weeks’ worth of rain falls in just a few hours. Winds of up to 60mph are also expected, with huge waves battering the coast.

However forecasters are still hoping the the storm veers off course and misses Britain altogether. 

Enjoy it while it lasts: People relaxing during lunch on Brighton beach today. Temperatures reached around the 20C in Brighton and the South Coast. However, the situation looks very different on Sunday because the remnants of Hurricane Bertha could make landfall

Today has stayed dry for most of the UK, with isolated showers continuing in the northwest. Pictured, sunbathers on Brighton beach

Last night the Met Office was taking no chances and issued a severe weather warning for most of England and Wales, urging people to keep an eye on ‘volatile’ conditions. A separate weather system will also cause heavy rain across the country today – before Bertha even arrives. 

The hurricane formed in the warm waters of the Caribbean last weekend, lashing the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands with winds of up to 90mph. 

Bertha then travelled north, veering safely away from the US and Canadian coast before heading across the Atlantic. It has now been downgraded to an ‘Atlantic storm’, losing power as it travels. 

Forecasters say there is a 60 per cent chance it will hit the southern coast of England on Sunday morning, before it sweeps up towards the North-East.

There is a smaller chance – around 10 per cent – that it could track further north, striking Wales, then Manchester and Cumbria. There is a 30 per cent chance it will go further south, missing England and blowing over France instead. 

Looming menace: Hurricane Bertha is losing power but could still bring heavy rain and strong winds to the UK

There are weather warnings across the south and large swathes of the Midlands, warning of flooding and standing water on the roads. Right, a satellite image of Hurricane Bertha close to the east Coast of America taken yesterday

Eddy Carroll, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: ‘The remains of Hurricane Bertha, over the western side of the Atlantic on Thursday morning, will come steadily towards the UK.

‘There is the potential for widespread rainfall totals of more than 50mm [almost two inches] and coastal gusts of over 60mph, along with large waves. [But] there is still considerable uncertainty and a chance the system may pass to the south of the country, or spread heavy rain even further north.

‘The transition from a tropical to an extra-tropical feature is a particularly hard one to forecast... Computer models continue to differ in the location and intensity of the resulting depression, which is expected to pass over, or close to, the UK from early on Sunday.’

Laura Young, Met Office spokesman, added: ‘Given that it is the summer and people are not prepared for weather like this, it could have a real impact.

‘People who went away for the first fortnight of the school holidays will be returning this weekend, so there may be travel disruptions.’

The Environment Agency also warned of flash flooding throughout England today as a depression comes in from the Channel.

Craig Woolhouse, the agency’s flood incident manager, said: ‘Heavy downpours, some slow-moving, bring a risk of localised surface water flooding to parts of the Midlands, the North-West and eastern areas of England on Friday.

‘On Sunday and Monday high spring tides and strong westerly winds bring a possible risk of flooding to the South-West coast of England and along the Severn Estuary.

‘Heavy rain may also lead to localised surface water flooding in parts of southern and central England.’
