When renowned American primatologist Dian Fossey was murdered in 1985 the mountain gorillas population was estimated to be as low as 250 animals in the wild.

Dr Fossey, who dedicated her life to saving the species, was found face-up on the floor of her cabin in the forest, having been bludgeoned with a machete.

As well as inspiring the Oscar-nominated movie Gorillas in the Mist, her life's work also gave rise to the Gorilla Doctors, who nearly 30 years later have contributed greatly to bringing the species back from the brink of extinction.

Gorilla Doctors: The international team of veterinarians operates in the heart of Africa, treating maimed and critically ill gorillas in Uganda, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo

Help: The veterinary team intervenes when the gentle giants are trapped in poacher's snares and exhibiting symptoms of potentially fatal human viruses

The most recent census revealed that today, there are 880 mountain gorillas ranging in central Africa.

The
 international team of veterinarians operates in the heart of Africa, 
treating maimed and critically ill gorillas in Uganda, Rwanda, and the 
Democratic Republic of Congo.

Their
 work extends beyond wild gorilla health care: the Gorilla Doctors treat
 infants orphaned by poachers, conduct wildlife disease surveillance to 
look for emerging pandemic threats, and provide health care and medicine
 to over 2,000 national park workers and their family members.

The
 veterinary team intervenes when the gentle giants are trapped in 
poacher's snares, exhibiting symptoms of potentially fatal human 
viruses.and suffering from life-threatening trauma resulting from 
conflict amongst and between gorilla groups.

‘This
 is the most challenging job I have ever had, but also the most 
rewarding,’ said American Dr Jan Ramer, the Gorilla Doctors regional manager.

‘I visited Rwanda 
in 1985 when I was a primate keeper at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. I 
was lucky enough to meet Dian Fossey and saw mountain gorillas for the 
first time during that visit.

‘I fell in love and always dreamed of returning to Rwanda and working in gorilla conservation.’

‘Much
 of my job consists of reporting, accounting, and meeting with partners,
 government officials and donors but I still love it when I get to be a 
clinical veterinarian.’

'This is the most challenging job I have ever had, but also the most rewarding'

Dr Jan Ramer, Gorilla Doctors regional manager

Empowering local doctors is an important objective within the organisation.

Dr
 Ramer is the only expatriate veterinarian on the ground - the majority 
of the team is comprised of Rwandan, Ugandan, and Congolese 
veterinarians and all support staff are African.

The
 Gorilla Doctors' work continues to see the mountain gorilla population 
rise, while all other monitored populations of great apes around the 
world are steadily declining.

The
 last six years have seen the vets and scientists employ increasingly 
advanced techniques, which they hope will help all critically endangered
 species, not just gorillas.

Gorilla
 Doctors operates under a 'One Health' approach to conserving the 
species, which live in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda 
and the Virunga Massif, which straddles the borders of Rwanda, Uganda 
and DR Congo.

'One Health' is a belief that the 
health of one species is inextricably linked to that of the entire 
ecosystem - including humans and other animal species.

This
 is important as disease can be spread by local people, who, earning an 
average of $1 (£0.59) a day, delve into the forest for resources such as
 water and firewood, as well as to hunt bushmeat.

The
 region, which is the most densely populated in Africa, is also a magnet
 for thousands of eco-tourists who trek to the habituated gorilla 
groups, eager to observe the wild apes in their natural habitat.

The
 Rwanda Development Board, which orchestrates the gorilla tourism 
program, requires tourists maintain a 23ft (7m) distance from the 
gorillas.

However, the gorillas are not aware of the rule and often approach much closer, making disease transmission a primary concern.

But
 there is two-way traffic around the national park and some of the 
mountain gorillas, which can weigh 30st, also wander out of the 
protected forest and into close proximity to local communities in search
 of eucalyptus and bamboo shoots.

The common cold could potentially kill the animals, who share 98.5 per cent of their genes with humans.

In fact, infectious disease, such as 
human-born respiratory illness, accounts for 20 per cent of mountain 
gorilla deaths in central Africa.

Gorilla
 Doctors immediately treat all gorillas exhibiting severe respiratory 
illness symptoms with medications to help the animal overcome the 
infection quickly.

The 
region the Gorilla Doctors operate in is also one of the most turbulent
 in the world and has been marred by genocide and war.

'We monitor their heath, intervene when a gorilla is sick and rescue orphans when they are confiscated by authorities from poachers or dealers'

Dr Eddy Kambale, Gorilla Doctors head veterinarian in DRC

At
 times, the team has been unable to monitor the gorillas' health, 
primarily in the DR Congo, where rebel factions have
 moved into the gorilla's habitat.

Most
 recently, the M23 rebel group occupied the Mikeno Sector of Virunga 
National Park for 18 months and were finally dispersed by the Congolese 
army and UN forces, allowing conservation workers to re-enter the park 
and check on the gorillas and other wildlife.

Their
 latest mission, to fly a young Grauer's gorilla orphan named Ihirwe to 
the Grace sanctuary in north-eastern DRC, was made possible by UN 
forces.

Gorilla Doctors has provided critical medical care to over 30 orphan gorillas since the organisation's inception.

The
 Senkwekwe Centre, located in Rumangabo, DRC, is home to four mountain 
gorilla orphans and one suspected Grauer's gorilla orphan.

The
 Gorilla Rehabilitation and Conservation Education (Grace) center is 
home to 14 Grauer's, or eastern lowland gorilla orphans.

The Grauer's gorilla is slightly larger and less hariy than the mountain gorilla subspecies.

Dr
 Eddy Kambale, the Gorilla Doctors head veterinarian in DR Congo, has 
been directly involved in the care of 24 orphans rescued from poachers.

He said: ‘My work with the Gorilla Doctors consists of saving one gorilla's life at a time.

‘I
 usually spend about 20 days in the field at a time but this is 
determined by the gorillas' health, which can increase the number of 
days.

‘We monitor their 
heath, intervene when a gorilla is sick and rescue orphans when they are
 confiscated by authorities from poachers or dealers.’

The latest rescued orphan was a
 female gorilla - later named Kalonge - who was turned over to officials
 at Kahuzi Biega National Park after being caught in a poacher's snare.

New
 arrivals at the Senkwekwe Center, such as infant Kalonge, must be 
placed in quarantine for 30 days, to establish the health status of the 
animal and prevent transmission of diseases among orphans.

Once
 Kalonge arrived at the Senkwekwe Centre, she was immediately placed in 
the care of experienced caregivers Babo and Phillipe, both former 
Virunga National Park rangers.

‘These two men are very experienced in the care of orphan gorillas’ said Dr Ramer.

‘They know how to make gorilla appeasement vocalizations, gently hold the orphan when she is frightened and encourage her to eat - which is not a small task. They will remain with Kalonge 24/7, even sleeping beside her, to slowly gain her trust.’

As infants, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two subspecies of eastern gorilla.

The Gorilla Doctors take blood, fur and faeces samples, and ship them to the Max Planck Institute in Cologne, Germany, for DNA analysis before they can determine the orphan's long-term care facility.

Dr Ramer added: ‘If we confirm she is a Grauer's gorilla she will be taken to Grace to join the 14 other orphans there.

‘If, on the outside chance, she is found to be a mountain gorilla she will stay at Senkwekwe and join the four mountain gorillas, Maisha, Ndakasi, Ndeze, and Matabishi, who live there.

‘Either way, she will finally be back with her own kind, living in a forested enclosure and allowed to be a healthy and happy gorilla.’

The Gorilla Doctors were formed in 1986 as the Virunga Veterinary Center, later becoming the ‘Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project’.

Starting from the first Gorilla Doctor, Dr James Foster, the organisation now employs 14 veterinarians and operates in DR Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.

The Gorilla Doctors is powered by the non-profit Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project and the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center and is directed by Dr Mike Cranfield and Dr Kirsten Gilardi.
