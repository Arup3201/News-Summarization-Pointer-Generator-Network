Guantanamo Bay inmates are being given reclining chairs and video games as they are force fed after military officials brought in changes to the heavily criticised practice, condemned as torture by the UN.

Some of the long-term hunger strikers are now reportedly being given hundreds of films and video games to choose from and a comfy chair to sit in while they are tube fed at the detention centre, Vice News has reported.

Military officials have claimed the new procedures can help detainees 'improve their eating habits and thus their overall health', but critics have described force-feeding as torturous and said 'a comfy chair doesn't change that.'

The changes were brought in by the military to improve the practice of force-feeding after the UN described it as torture (pictured, some Playstation 3 games the inmates can chose from)

The new procedures were reportedly brought in by officials in October at the same time as hunger strikes were rebranded as 'long-term non-religious fasts'.

According to the report, inmates are given films including Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland to watch and video games such as Portal 2 to play while being force fed.

The new policy only applies to detainees who are 'compliant' while being force-fed, Vice News reported after obtaining declarations in a lawsuit filed by a detainee challenging the methods used to force-feed him as abusive.

Detainees who are force-fed and are 
not considered to be compliant are forced to sit in a restraint chair during
 the procedure, which has been described as a 'painful, degrading and 
humiliating process' by a federal court judge.

Zeke
 Johnson, director of Amnesty International USA's work on national 
security and counterterrorism, said: 'Force feeding can amount to cruel 
treatment and even torture. A comfy chair doesn't change that.

'The administration should immediately stop force feeding mentally competent detainees on hunger strike.

Among films detainees can chose from are Time Burton's Alice in Wonderland and games such as Portal 2

'There should be a detailed review of all policies implemented in response to the hunger strike, including force-feeding, and the administration must ensure that it complies with international human rights law and medical ethics.' 

The United Nations has described the practice of force feeding as a form of torture, while President Barack Obama also previously condemned it, saying in his national security address: ‘Is this who we are? Is this something that our Founders foresaw?’

Three doctors writing last 
year in the New England Journal of Medicine meanwhile called Guantanamo a
 ‘medical ethics-free zone’ and urged doctors there to speak out. 
‘Force-feeding a competent person is not the practice of medicine; it is
 aggravated assault,’ they said.

In April last year, the American Medical Association said force-feeding detainees violated the profession’s ‘core ethical values’.

US Marine General John Kelly, who oversees Guantanamo, sparked criticism when he denied detainees were being force-fed, calling it ‘Hunger Strike Lite’.

Last month it was reported that a federal
 judge had lifted a temporary restraining order that had stopped the 
U.S. military from force feeding a hunger-striking prisoner at 
Guantanamo Bay naval base, saying the man's life hangs in the balance.

U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler said the military must be allowed to carry out force feeding in the case of Abu Wa'el Dhiab because of the 'very real probability that Mr. Dhiab will die.'

Dhiab was rapidly deteriorating and she would not reissue a temporary order from the previous week that stopped the military from force-feeding him.

Lawyers for Dhiab are challenging force feeding during the hunger strike as abusive.

Dhiab's lawyers have argued that the practice of forcibly extracting him and other prisoners from their cells, restraining them and feeding them through a tube inserted into their noses, was also illegal.

The Defense Department has said the military only feeds prisoners against their will to keep them alive, and follows all laws when it does so.

Kessler says the detainee is willing to be fed at a hospital at Guantanamo Bay if he can be spared what the judge calls the agony of having feeding tubes inserted and removed for each feeding.

The judge said the Defense Department refused to make any compromise from current procedure.

On Wednesday, May 21, the judge brushed aside the Justice Department's objections and ordered the government to produce 34 videotapes that show Dhiab being forcibly removed from his cell, followed by force feeding the hunger-striking prisoner.

Earlier that week, Kessler said she urged
 the government and Dhiab's lawyers to reach a compromise on the 
procedure used to feed Dhiab, but that the Defense Department has 
'refused to make these compromises.'

According to the report, inmates are given films including Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland to watch and video games such as Portal 2 to play while being force fed

In her order on Thursday, May 22, she said the court will move quickly in the case to consider the merits. Kessler issued the temporary restraining order a week earlier.

'The court is now faced with an anguishing Hobson's choice,' Kessler said, in lifting the temporary restraining order.

If she issues another temporary order to stop the forced feeding, Dhiab probably will die, the judge said.

Alternatively, allowing the force feeding possibly will result in great pain and suffering, she added.
