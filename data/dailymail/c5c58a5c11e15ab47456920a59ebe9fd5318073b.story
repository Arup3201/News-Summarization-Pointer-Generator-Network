Jos Buttler was the victim of a 'Mankad' dismissal during England's one-day international - and the perpetrator was controversial Sri Lanka spinner Sachithre Senanayake.

Buttler, the new golden boy of English cricket, was run out by the bowler backing up. The fact he was out of his crease meant the dismissal was legitimate - especially as the batsman was twice warned in the spinner's previous over.

Despite being legal it is seen as some as against the spirit of the game and the fact it was Senanayake - who was reported for a suspect bowling action the day before the match - only added controversy.

Not in the spirit? Sachithra Senanayake appeals for the run out of Jos Buttler at the non-striker's end

The bowler is permitted, before releasing the ball and provided he has not completed his usual delivery swing, to attempt to run out the non-striker. Whether the attempt is successful or not, the ball shall not count as one of the over. If the bowler fails in an attempt to run out the non-striker, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon possible.

ICC Standard ODI Match Playing Conditions

Law 42.15 shall be replaced by the following:The bowler is permitted, before he releases the ball and provided he has not completed his usual delivery swing, to attempt to run out the non-striker. Whether the attempt is successful or not, the ball shall not count as one of the over

The practice is named after Indian Vinoo Mankad, who ran out the Australian Bill Brown during a Test in 1947/48.

The act infuriated by Aussies and has been known as 'Mankading' ever since.

The dismissal sparked quite a reaction, with Graeme Swann tweeting: 'I think if I'd been called for chucking I'd try to keep a low profile for a while rather than pull out the mankad!!! Incredible scenes!' He later added: 'To be clear on this I think the mankad is just wrong even though it's not illegal. Like cuddling your sister whilst watching a film.'

Former England captain Michael Vaughan waded in with his opinion and his ire was aimed at Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews. Captains usually decide to call the batsman back in these instances but Mathews did not and Vaughan tweeted: 'Totally blame the Captain... He is the man who makes the decisions and should have over turned the decision... No way to play the game...'

Ah, go on! Senanayake tries to persuade the umpire to give Buttler run out and was eventually successful

Former England captain Alec Stewart added: 'The spirit of cricket has been broken but Sri Lanka are within their rights to uphold the appeal. The laws of the game allow this dismissal.'

Warwickshire all-rounder Rikki Clarke raged: 'That is absolutely rubbish. Can't get Jos Buttler out normally that they have to do that.'

And former Manchester United and Everton footballer Phil Neville - a good junior cricketer - gave his two penn'orth, saying: I got run out like that once -greemount vs glodick away I was 11 playing in 3rd xl - it nearly started a full scale riot!!'

England were all out for 219.
