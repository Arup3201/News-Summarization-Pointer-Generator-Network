England World Cup hopeful Henry Slade has been named Aviva Premiership player of month for February.

The 21-year-old fly-half was in fine form throughout the month as Exeter Chiefs won all three of their matches to propel themselves right in to play-off contention.

Slade scored 54 points in total, including two tries, in victories over Newcastle, Harlequins and Bath.

Slade has continued that fine form in to March, scoring a try and kicking a further 13 points in last weekend's 74-19 demolition of London Welsh that sent Exeter second in the table.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster this week heaped praise on Slade, who can also play in the centres or at full-back, as he called the Chiefs playmaker in to his squad as an injury replacement for Brad Barritt.

'The more I see him, the more I think he's got fantastic potential,' said Lancaster. 'I've always known it having seen him come through the age-group teams.

'We have a lot of competition at fly-half, but he's also adept in the centres. That's one of the options I'd like to look at for him in the future. For definite he'll be a part of our World Cup camp.'

Former England international, BT Sport analyst and Aviva ambassador Austin Healey was also glowing in his praise of Slade, who remains uncapped but did impress for an England XV against the Barbarians at Twickenham last summer.

'Every time Henry Slade touches the ball something happens,' Healey said. 'There is no doubt in my mind the lad has the potential to win 50 caps or more for England. He is too talented and works too hard not to achieve Test caps.

'I have been watching him closely this season and I believe he is ready to step into the England team now.

'Henry is one of the best attackers in Aviva Premiership Rugby, is solid in defence and can kick goals – is there anything this lad can’t do? Those attributes make him a much deserved winner of the Aviva Premiership Rugby Player of the Month Award for February.

'The only decision left is where he finally plays for England. It could be any of three positions – 12, 13 or 15.'

Slade beat Wasps outside back Elliot Daly, Northampton flanker Calum Clark and Newcastle winger Sinoti Sinoti to the award.
