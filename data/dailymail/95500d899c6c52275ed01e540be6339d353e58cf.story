Former N-Dubz singer Dappy has appeared in court to deny assaulting a man outside a nightclub.

The 26-year-old is alleged to have assaulted the man last month after he made an appearance at the Chicago Rock Cafe in Chelmsford, Essex, nicknamed Chicago's by locals.

Appearing today under his real name Costadinos Contostavlos, he spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty to one count of assault by beating.

Denial: The former N-Dubz singer pleaded not guilty to one count of assault outside a Chelmsford nightclub

The alleged incident was outside the Chicago Rock Cafe (centre), nicknamed Chicago's by locals

The alleged offence happened in the early hours of February 27.

The singer, of St Albans, 
Hertfordshire, stood in the dock in a white shirt, black trousers and 
black trainers without his signature beanie hat as the charge was read to him.

Grace Court, prosecuting, told the court the alleged incident was said to have happened in the smoking area of the club.

Chelmsford magistrates granted him unconditional bail and he is due to stand trial for two days at the same magistrates' court from June 18.

Dappy made his name alongside his cousin Tulisa Contostavlos and British rapper Fazer in hip hop band N-Dubz.

He had success as a solo artist in recent years, working with Tinchy Stryder and Brian May of Queen, but said he plans to reunite N-Dubz, who went on hiatus in 2011 and officially split the following year.

The band formed in Camden Town in 2000 and released a handful of singles under their original name the Lickle Rinsers Crew.

Dappy finished in second place on reality show Celebrity Big Brother in January.

He was the runner-up behind comedian Jim Davidson after making headlines for his efforts to woo fellow contestant Jasmine Waltz.

After the appearance at Chicago's last month, he told his followers on Twitter that he had a 'great night' and the 'crowd was amazing'.

Following today's hearing Dappy was led by a minder through a pack of press photographers, a dark jacket covering his head, and put in a black Audi before speeding away.

He was later seen shopping in Chelmsford, loading the boot of his car with an armful of bags from Topshop before visiting a Ladbrokes betting shop.
