The UK ranks as the third cheapest destination in Europe for car hire and petrol for a week's holiday, making it more expensive for Britons heading to holiday hotspots Germany, France and Greece. 

But it's not just petrol prices that vary across Europe, average car hire costs can be more than four times as much for a seven day car hire, depending on the country.

Again, Spain comes out top with the best value car hire at just £62.54 for a week, closely followed by Portugal at £66.59. Comparatively Norway is yet again the most expensive with car hire coming in at £253.35 for a week.

Spain, with the best value for both car hire and petrol, is the best value country to visit for a road trip, with a 500 mile, week-long trip costing just £137 or 27p per mile.

The same trip in Norway would cost 258 per cent more, at £354 for the week long trip – or 71p per mile. 

Portugal is ranked as the second best value country to visit, despite having only the 4th cheapest petrol, due to its affordable car hire.

'It's not just the initial car hire costs which affect the price of a holiday but also the fuel stops which need to be paid for over the course of the trip' said Hayley Smith from Skyscanner.

'Travellers should do their homework before booking road trips to establish which countries have the best value routes and where they can get the most bang for their buck.'

Ms Smith added: 'We've done the hard work for five trips around Europe's most popular destinations to help provide holidaymakers with clarity around the costs they should expect to pay.

'What's clear is Spain is a great all-round option for those sun-seekers looking to get the best deal for car hire and petrol prices.' Hayley added.

'Travellers can save even more money by planning their routes including fuel stops, in advance. If they are intending to cross borders, remember that countries fuel costs differ. 

'For example for those travelling from Spain to France should fill up their tank before the border as Spain's petrol prices are cheaper,' continued Hayley.
