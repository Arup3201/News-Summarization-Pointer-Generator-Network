Jailed: Paul Collins stole a pensioner's £60,000 life savings to feed his secret cocaine habit

A neighbourhood watch volunteer who helped police arrest a gang of drug addicts was today jailed for stealing a pensioner's £60,000 life savings to feed his secret cocaine habit.

Paul Collins, 55, was a well-respected member of his local community in Prestwich, Greater Manchester.

He even won a government grant to create a community garden there.

But he was stealing money from an 89-year-old woman he had befriended to fund his drug habit.

Collins exploited his position with 
Home Watch and as head of a residents group to gain his victim’s trust 
before persuading her to hand over her bank cards.

He then drained up to £60,000 from her bank accounts to pay for cocaine, a car and a computer.

Collins
even managed to get the vulnerable, housebound pensioner to sign him up
as power of attorney, putting him in charge of all her financial 
affairs.

The alarm was 
raised in May 2011 when a social worker visited the elderly lady and was
told Collins had a key to her flat and access to her credit cards.

Collins pleaded guilty  to one charge of fraud and one count of theft and was today jailed for 28 months at Bolton Crown Court.

He met his victim in early 2010 as part of his involvement  in the Home Watch scheme, police said.

He
was well-known for helping other elderly and disabled neighbours on the
Prestwich estate, where he was also head of the residents’ group.

After initially running small errands for his victim, Collins offered to look after her financial interests and funeral plans.

She gave him her bank cards, PIN numbers and other documentation for three bank accounts.

In August 2010, her will was amended to make Collins executor and sole beneficiary of her estate in the event of her death.

Towards the end of 2010, she was hospitalised for a few months. It was in February 2011, while she remained in hospital, that the
Lasting Power of Attorney Document was stamped and authorised, allowing
Collins to act on her behalf over her property and financial affairs.

The
court heard £27,000 had been transferred directly to Collins’ bank 
account using five separate cheques, signed by his unwitting victim.

Another
£12,000 was taken from cash machines to buy a car for his daughter, 
while a cheque for £4,000 was used to hire a car and buy a computer.

He spent just £6,000 on the victim.

In
January 2010, her three bank accounts holding her life savings totalled
£61,205.67. By July 2011, there was just £554.79 left.

A
victim impact statement read in court said the pensioner had been left 
'distressed’ and in poor health as she had regarded Collins as a trusted
friend.

Keith Harrison, 
defending, said Collins had not initially befriended the woman to steal 
from her but later gave in to temptation because he was 'in the grip of 
an addiction to cocaine'.

The
court was told that Collins was previously a well-regarded community 
volunteer who had helped police tackle anti-social behaviour committed by drug addicts.

WPC Heather Jackson, speaking outside court today, described Collins' action as 'a calculated fraud'.

She said: 'This
resulted in the loss of the life savings of a vulnerable 89-year-old 
woman who believed Collins was a good friend who had her best interests 
at heart.

'He has blown her life savings and left her penniless. This
despicable breach of trust has had a significant and detrimental impact
on her health and I hope she finds some comfort now he has been 
jailed.'

Chief 
Superintendent Jon Rush, added: 'Collins acted in isolation and his 
offending in no way reflects the excellent work being carried out by 
Home Watch schemes across Bury.'
