Stoke manager Mark Hughes feels the Football Association's decision not to charge Garry Monk could have set a dangerous precedent.

Swansea boss Monk was asked to explain his comments after calling Stoke winger Victor Moses a cheat for going down under a challenge from Angel Rangel that earned the Potters a penalty in their 2-1 Barclays Premier League victory earlier this month.

TV pundit John Hartson apologised for echoing Monk's sentiments but the Swans manager stood by his comments and the FA this week decided to take no further action.

Asked if it had set an unwelcome precedent, Hughes said: 'I think it may well have done. Maybe that word is allowed to be used by ourselves. It seems to be that the FA's vindicated what was said.'

Earlier in the same game, Swansea were awarded a penalty by referee Michael Oliver after Ryan Shawcross tussled with Wilfried Bony in the box.

The issue has become a major talking point and Stoke are angry that Shawcross has been singled out as the most high-profile offender.

Hughes has even relieved his captain of marking duties at set-pieces because of concerns referees are looking to punish him.

The Stoke manager said: 'We are speaking to people we feel have got an influence and need to be told our feelings about the situation, because we feel quite strongly. That's ongoing.

'Sometimes you've got to get the message across that we're not going to stand for it and we think it's unfair. I'm sure Ryan will be fine but, if it goes on any longer, then it's detrimental to any player. We need to stop it.'

Hughes does not feel the standard of refereeing in general is where it needs to be and thinks one improvement would be for potential issues from each game to be looked at straight away.

He said: 'My view is the whole game needs to be reviewed by the referee and his team immediately after a game rather than waiting a couple of days to see what media outcry there is and then someone who wasn't even at the game is asked to see whether decisions are right or wrong.'

He then added, in a dig at Mark Clattenburg following his ban this week: 'Sometimes they've got pop concerts to go to so maybe that's the reason they don't want to do that.'

Stoke are looking to get back to winning ways against West Ham on Saturday following back-to-back defeats by Southampton in league and cup.

While Saints are the form team of the Premier League, West Ham are not far behind with three successive wins, including over Manchester City last weekend.

'They're doing very well, playing exceptionally well,' said Hughes. 'They've changed their way of playing somewhat but don't underestimate, they still have plan A and plan B; if they feel they need to go long, they will do.

Hughes was not impressed with referee Mark Clattenburg's decision to attend an Ed Sheeran concert

'It's not a bad option, obviously we use it as well so it's not something to make apologies about. It works at the right time.

'They've got good pace up front. The lads they've brought in have made an immediate impact, scored goals. It's gone really well for them and they're playing with a lot of confidence.'

Stoke will try to succeed where the Hammers' last seven opponents have failed in stopping Diafra Sakho from scoring.

The summer signing from Metz has been a revelation and already more than justified his reported fee of £3.5million.

Stoke will attempt to stop West Ham's in-form striker Diafra Sakho at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday

Hughes said of Sakho: 'He has done really well. I didn't know a great deal about him, and they're always a risk.

'Until you bring them to the league, you're never quite sure how they're going to deal with the physicality of the Premier League, but credit to him, he's done exceptionally well. He's a real threat and I've been very impressed with him.'

Stoke will be without suspended duo Phil Bardsley and Peter Crouch, who Hughes revealed has apologised following his sending off against Southampton in midweek.
