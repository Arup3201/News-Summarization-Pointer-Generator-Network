Reg Winsor pictured with the tools he uses to fix potholes so effectively his local council has offered him a job

Tired of pleading with the council to repair potholes blighting his village, Reg Winsor took matters into his own hands.

The retired builder, 72, picked up his tools once more, and took just 15 minutes to fix a notorious hole – known locally as ‘the crater’.

Officials at Devon County Council were so impressed with his work they approached him about tackling other potholes in the area.

He has now assembled a group of 50 volunteers, dubbed ‘Reg’s army’, to carry out the repairs.

Mr Winsor said he was forced to take drastic action after the council repeatedly ignored his complaints about potholes near his home in Ilsington, Dartmoor.

The local authority has an estimated repair backlog costing £758million for its 8,000 miles of town and country roads.

The day after Mr Winsor fixed ‘the crater’, he was approached by two officers from the highways department, who suggested he train to become a volunteer ‘road warden’. He said: ‘I’d been complaining about this pothole for months and even though I was going through the right means, nothing was done.

‘It’s simple really – they haven’t got the money to do it, so I just decided to do it myself.

‘The Tarmac was given to me by local labourers and the rest I had.’

While Mr Winsor maintained that it is the council’s responsibility to fix the roads, he said residents should be more willing to help. ‘Mr Average is more than happy to sit there moaning about it but doesn’t do anything,’ he said.

‘I know we pay council taxes for repairs like this, but at the end of the day we may as well just fix them now.

‘We need to do it as a team, together everyone achieves more.’

Mr Winsor, a parish councillor, said his team would compile a list of potholes in the area and work to fix them as soon as possible.

But predictably, they could find themselves hindered by bureaucracy. The local authority said Mr Winsor will be liable for any issues arising from his repairs until he undertakes formal training.

His team will also only be allowed to fix minor defects that the council does not deem urgent enough to repair immediately.

The cost of repairing Britain’s potholes stands at £12billion, according to a recent report.

Around £32million a year is paid out in compensation for injuries and damage to cars caused by poorly maintained roads.

Councillor Stuart Hughes, Devon’s cabinet member for highways, said: ‘Devon County Council is looking to respond positively to offers of help from local members of the community like Reg.’ 

Parking charges and fines made councils in England a record £667million last year.

The surplus was up 12 per cent on the previous year, and the fifth annual rise in a row, according to figures from the RAC Foundation.

Its director, Professor Stephen Glaister, said: ‘Over the same period, spending on local roads has fallen about a fifth in real terms.’

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles accused councils of ‘daylight robbery’ by ‘ripping off drivers with exorbitant parking charges and unfair fines’.

Westminster had the biggest surplus in 2013/14, with £51million.
