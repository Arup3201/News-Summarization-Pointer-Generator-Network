Oscar's host Ellen DeGeneres failed to keep up appearances for sponsor's Samsung during Sunday night's ceremony when she kept posting pictures to Twitter backstage from her own iPhone.

Shooting what seemed like a carefully coordinated social-media and advertising blitz in the foot, DeGeneres snapped the now-famous A-list selfie and several other pictures with her Galaxy Note 3 live on air, but when she was off camera, she reverted to her trusty Apple smartphone.

Having spent upwards of $25 million over the past five years of Oscar ceremonies at $1.8 million for 30-seconds of advertising space, Samsung would have been dismayed to see their chief rival gatecrashing what should have been a promotional coup for the South Korean firm.

Publicity coup: It is now famous - dubbed the greatest selfie ever - and was uploaded to the Twitter account of Ellen DeGeneres after being taken on her Galaxy smartphone - provided to her by official Oscar's sponsor Samsung

Indeed, while the selfie featuring 
Kevin Spacey, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Lawrence taken on 
her Samsung Galaxy Note 3 phone was an undoubted success, the gloss was 
rubbed off when DeGeneres posted photos online from her iPhone, such as 
one selfie with actor Channing Tatum.

The
 two-time host was rumbled because the source of the photograph as 
posted to Twitter can not be seen on their own page, but this 
information is visible by using a third-party app such as TweetDeck.

And in at at least two pictures posted to Twitter by DeGeneres, the source was revealed to be her  iPhone.

To make matters worse for Samsung, the South Korean firm was also ABC's 'The Oscars Backstage' sponsor, which called for a series of 10 promoted tweets of celebrity selfies to be posted online during the ceremony.

However,
 while Samsung have not responded publicly yet to the mild embarrassment
 of DeGeneres' mix-and-matching of smartphones, they still have the huge
 publicity that the A-list selfie generated as it was re-tweeted almost 3
 million times and crashed Twitter.

'Samsung's unique product placement, woven into the moment, front and center, without seeming ham-handed, generated the type of positive buzz that is rarely seen and is actually hard to buy," said Ammiel Kamon, EVP of products and marketing for Kontera, a prominent social media data tracker.

'Kudos to Ellen for pulling it off,' said Kamon to USA Today.

Ellen isn't the first celebrity to have her choice of smartphone questioned. Singer Alicia Keys was called out for tweets sent via iPhone after she had been named Global Creative Director for smartphone maker BlackBerry.

But she blamed the incident of hackers.

Whoops: While Samsung would have thought their PR victory was complete with the selfie - backstage Ellen was posting pictures to Twitter taken on her iPhone

And
 despite their huge presence at the Oscar's during which they launched a
 whole new range of products including their new Galaxy S5 smartphone, 
Samasung have denied they had paid DeGeneres or ABC any money or 
engineered the celebrity-packed selfie.

The
 South Korean firm did admit to 'an integration with ABC' but the firm 
said that it was DeGeneres who chose to 'organically incorporate the 
device into the selfie moment that had everyone talking.'

In
 addition, Samsung said it would be donating $1.5 million each to two of
 'Ellen’s charities of choice,' namely St. Jude’s and the Humane 
Society.

But in a move 
which seemed to confirm at least some kind of publicity tie-in, Samsung 
and DeGeneres gifted her audience all a Galaxy smartphone as she 
presented her show today.

On Sunday night DeGeneres repeatedly brandished her Galaxy during the ceremony she 
hosted - taking selfies of stars such as Oscar winner Lizi Minnelli, 
which she posted online.

The
 impromptu and now iconic selfie, which DeGeneres claimed was not 
intended, set the record for the most retweeted post ever and even 
temporarily disrupted Twitter's service.

The
 previously most-retweeted Twitter post was by President Obama after 
winning his second term in 2012. That tweet got 778,000 retweets.

DeGeneres’ tweet even knocked Twitter
 offline for a bit, racking up more than 700,000 retweets and nearly 
200,000 favorites in just 30 minutes.

'We crashed and broke Twitter,' DeGeneres said later from the stage. 'We made history.'

Twitter declined to comment on the service glitches except for a statement on its status blog according to the LA Times:

'Between
 19:05 and 19:29 PST today, some users may have experienced issues 
viewing and sending tweets on twitter.com and Twitter’s mobile apps.

'Traffic was redirected away from the components that were experiencing problems, and the issue has now been resolved.'

However,
 Twitter did send a congratulatory tweet to DeGeneres remarking, 'The 
envelope  please … to @TheEllenShow -- this is now the most retweeted 
tweet with over 1 million RTs. Congrats!'

Ellen's Samsung use was designed to highlight its new range of products including the Galaxy Note Pro tablet, the Galaxy S5 phone, the Gear 2 smartwatch and a curved ultra-high-definition TV.

As part of a deal with broadcast network, ABC, Samsung also sponsored 10 tweets from Ellen featuring selfies in the backstage green room and posted onto the account of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.

However, DeGeneres seems to have posted 4 out of her ten from her iPhone, not her Samsung Galaxy S5 which operates the Android platform.

Crash: DeGeneres' tweet even knocked Twitter offline for a bit, racking up more than 700,000 retweets and nearly 200,000 favorites in just 30 minutes.

Let me in: The selfie was not planned by Ellen to unfold this way - it was meant to be a quick joke at the expense of Meryl Streep and quickly became something else entirely

It seems though, that one thing DeGeneres was sure of crashing Twitter in the wake of her sensational selfie.

'I thought it would crash,' DeGeneres told E!'s Marc Malkin at the Governors Ball.

'But I didn't know everyone would do it.' The comedienne told EOnline.Com.

'What's funny is that Lupita's brother is the most prominent. And then Jared came running over to be in it. And Angie got it in. I didn't expect all that.'

Indeed, DeGeneres even revealed that she originally wanted to do a visual joke with the selfie by taking the picture and cropping Meryl Streep's head from it.

'That was going to be the joke,' she revealed. 'But it doesn't matter. It was just great.'
