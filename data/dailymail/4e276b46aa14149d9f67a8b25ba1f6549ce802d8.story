Chelsea players looked focused and determined as they trained ahead of their Champions League tie with Maribor in Slovenia.

Jose Mourinho's men sit top of Group G on seven points, two clear of Schalke and five ahead of their opponents.

But the players did not look like they were taking the game lightly as they performed sprint drills and tactical exercises at Cobham ahead of the match at Ljudski Vrt.

Oscar, John Terry, Bransilav Ivanovic and Willian were among the stars practising their sprinting - while star striker Diego Costa trained and will be fit to play if selected.

Interestingly, Mourinho did not appear to crack a smile during the session just three days after his criticism of the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge.

The Blues won laboured to a 2-1 home victory over West London rivals Queens Park Rangers on Saturday thanks to goals from Oscar and Eden Hazard, but Mourinho was not impressed with his own fans.

He berated supporters after the game, saying it felt like 'an empty stadium'.

'Everyone knows how much I feel connected to this club and the fans,' he told talkSPORT. 'At this moment it's difficult for us to play at home though, because playing here is like playing in an empty stadium.

'The team then starts playing like it's a quiet, soft game at home. It's difficult to get that strong start where the players, team and fans at Stamford Bridge (are all together).

'I was today looking around and it was empty, but not in terms of people because it was obviously full. That's what is frustrating.'

Chelsea went 1-0 up in the first half through Oscar, but were given a scare when Charlie Austin equalised for the away side in the second half.

Mourinho also believes that the floodlights were not switched on as early as was necessary, leaving Stamford Bridge darker than it should have been until two minutes before Oscar's winning goal.

'I think the man responsible for the lights was in the same mood as the crowd, because everybody was sleeping,' Mourinho added. 

'He took 20 minutes to understand that it was dark, but I took 30 minutes to understand that the stadium was not empty.

'When we scored was when I realised, "woah, the stadium is full. Good."'
