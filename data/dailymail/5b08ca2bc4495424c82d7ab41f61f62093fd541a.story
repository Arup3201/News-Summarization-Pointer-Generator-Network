Eric Cantona has been arrested and cautioned by police after the Manchester United legend assaulted a man in London.

The trouble occurred when the Frenchman was drinking outside a London pub with a mystery brunette on Wednesday.

Cantona appeared deep in conversation with his companion as they drank beer in the sunshine.

But seconds after being spotted by a paparazzo, Cantona lashed out. Police were called to The Queens pub in Primrose Hill after the photographer was punched in the face.

The 47-year-old, a married father of two, was arrested and bundled into a police car. He was taken to a North London police station and held for more than six hours before accepting a caution.

Witnesses said his companion went inside the pub and waited before leaving through another door.

The Metropolitan Police have issued a statement saying: ‘Police were called to Regents Park Road, NW1, at 12.55pm on Wednesday 12th March, following reports of an assault.

'Officers from Camden Borough attended
 and a man in his mid-40s was arrested on suspicion of common assault. 
He was taken into custody and subsequently cautioned for common assault.
 The victim, a man, did not require medical assistance at the scene.'

Cantona,
 47, was arrested and convicted of assault in 1995 for his infamous 
kung-fu attack on a Crystal Palace fan who abused the Frenchman after he
 was sent off for booting defender Richard Shaw in a 1-1 draw at 
Selhurst Park.

Cantona 
received a two-week prison sentence, although that was later reduced to 
120 hours community service on appeal. He was also banned for eight 
months by the FA and fined a total of £30,000.

Passersby
 say the Frenchman initially refused to stop and talk with an initial 
officer who had to step in front of him to bring him to a halt.

Photographer Amari-Jade Robinson was driving past the scene near Regent's Park and initially thought the uniformed policeman was a fan.

He said: 'I thought he might be a fan and wanted to just speak to him.

'My window was wound down and I said out loud "I think that's Eric Cantona" and he looked round to me when I said it so I knew it was him.

'I was stopped in traffic for around three minutes and at first I didn't think he was getting in trouble, but then he seemed to be a bit frustrated.

'He attempted to walk away and looked a bit frustrated but the officer went in front of him. He was side stepping to block him.

Red alert: Cantona was a catalyst for United's huge success in the 1990s and beyond

'He seemed a bit frustrated at first, 
moving his arms, but then he seemed to calm down and talk to the officer
 - it looked like he was trying to explain something.'

Cantona
 had a troubled history even before his arrival in English football. In 
1987, he was fined for punching his Auxerre team-mate, goalkeeper Bruno 
Martini.

Then, while on loan at Montpellier, he was banned from the 
club’s ground for 10 days for throwing his boots in the face of teammate
 Jean-Claude Lemoult following a bust-up.

He
 was also suspended by Marseille for angrily kicking a ball into the 
crowd and throwing his shirt at the referee after being substituted 
during a friendly against Torpedo Moscow in 1989.

Cup of joy: Cantona won four Premier League crowns and the FA Cup twice - including this win in 1996
