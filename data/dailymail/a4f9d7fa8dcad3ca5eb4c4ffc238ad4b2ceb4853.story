The U.S. Navy has launched a new 12 million gallon indoor ocean the size of a football field to test its future warships.

The high-tech facility is based at the Naval Surface Warfare Centre (NSWC) in Washington. The tank was first built in 1962 but for the past six years it has undergone a dramatic renovation.

Originally, the facility had a large pneumatic wave making machine. These have been replaced by 216 individually-controlled electro-mechanical wave boards. 

Making waves: The new high-tech  machine, can create any type of sea condition at the push of a button

According to engineers at the facility, the new wave machine produces more precise data 

Jon Etxegoien,head of the NSW Carderock Naval architecture and engineering department said: 'This new finger-style technology provides the Navy with an unprecedented capability to create a realistic ocean environment inside of the facility, which enables us to collect more precise test data

'This upgrade, along with the size of the facility, makes the MASK the most advanced test facility of its kind in the world.'

His colleague Joseph Moeller said the new system allows them to mimic the ocean's most extreme conditions on demand. 

He said: 'In this facility, we can test scale models up to 30 feet in length in order to predict the full-scale performance of ships in the open ocean. We are very excited to begin exploring the facility's new capabilities and integrating them with our existing test equipment.'

The tank is 360 feet long and 240 feet wide and holds in the region of 12 million gallons of water. It is able to test the scale model of ships and moored platforms in all types of sea conditions.  

Engineers are able to create specific wave types from all different weather conditions.

Speaking to The Smithsonian Mr Etxegoien said: 'There are no freak waves in the world. They are all predicable.' 

The computer controlled systems can create sea conditions from dead calm to a typhoon. It also has the ability to mimic particular sea conditions from an individual ocean. 

As well as testing the handling characteristics of various ships in all weather conditions. The tank can help assess the extreme limits where a ship can launch a missile or if a helicopter can land on deck. 

Also, engineers can test the impact of the weight of a vessel and how it handles, whether the warship has a full fuel tank or is almost empty. 

According to The Smithsonian, in the past, engineers had to bring remote control vessels to the open ocean during particular weather events which was deemed inefficient. 

With the new system, engineers can mimic a six-week cruise in a fraction of the time. 

The system has the ability to test models at speeds of up to 50 knots. 

Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert recently visited the facility to receive a briefing on its capabilities. 

He said: 'Technology is moving fast, and some of that technology is being grabbed and put into military systems.' 

Addressing personnel at the facility he said: 'What you do here, make no mistake, is a major part of our advantage. When I talk to the folks who design and test the technology, what you do is astounding; it not only is good ship building, but it's also good ship design.'

The facility is currently testing the new $7billion DDC 1000 destroyer as well as a new design of submarine.
