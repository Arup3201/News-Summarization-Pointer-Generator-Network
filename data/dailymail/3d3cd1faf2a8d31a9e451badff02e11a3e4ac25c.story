The incident happened around 11:28pm Friday night at Womack's house in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Police say Little and Ashley had been broken up for about two weeks when he showed up at her house that night.

When he came over, Little proceeded to have an argument with Ashley and members of her family on the back patio of the house.

Little was leaving the house, and walking down the driveway to his car, when he pulled out a .45 calibur handgun and shot Ashley's mother Rhonda and 'family friend' Travis Wegener, 28.

He then proceeded to go back to the patio where he shot at Ashley.

Ashley's brother Joshua Womack, 22, heard the blasts and got out the family's .22 caliber rifle which he used to shoot Little several times.

Wegener died before paramedics arrived, while Little was pronounced dead after being transported to University of Tennessee Medical Center.

Ashley was also taken to the hospital where she was treated and released for a gunshot wound to the leg.

Her mother Rhonda was last reported in serious condition for a wound to the upper shoulder.

Neither Ashley's brother or her father Guy were injured in the rampage.

It's unclear what relationship Travis had to Ashley, but he posted two pictures of them together to his Instagram account the day before and of his death.

On one of the pictures, Ashley's mother commented: 'Love it!!! Close friendships are priceless'.

According to Knoxville Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk, Little was not wielding a department issued handgun at the time.

Little was a part of the police cadet program, aimed at people 21 years old or younger who want to explore careers in law enforcement.

Cadets are not issued handguns and are given tasks like answering citizen phone calls, issuing parking citations and assisting officers on various assignments.

They are non-sworn civilian employees.
