A British terror suspect who is wanted in the United States for allegedly conspiring with hook-handed extremist Abu Hamza has been extradited from the UK.

Haroon Rashid Aswat, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, is accused by US authorities of working with Hamza in 1999 to set up a Jihadist training camp in Oregon.

Earlier this year, the Home Secretary was told to put extradition plans on hold after judges heard that Aswat, 40, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.

But last month two High Court judges said they were satisfied with assurances given by American officials that he would be cared for.

Aswat, who was originally arrested at RAF Northolt on August 7 2005 by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service’s Extradition Unit, was taken from Broadmoor hospital to a UK airport this morning and handed over to US authorities.

Hamza was extradited from Britain to America nearly two years ago and found guilty of 11 terrorism charges in May after a trial in New York. He is facing life behind bars in the States.

The warrants issued on behalf of the US authorities allege that, between October 1 1999 and April 30 2000, Aswat conspired with others to control and manage people who would be employed for ‘the use or display of physical force in promoting a political object, namely to make hijrah to, and to fight jihad in, Afghanistan’.

Aswat’s lawyers had argued that he might suffer a relapse if held in an American jail pending any trial.

And, at a High Court hearing in April, judges had said they wanted assurances about the way he would be treated.

After a hearing last month, a Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are pleased the court has upheld the Home Secretary’s decision to extradite Haroon Aswat to the United States.

‘The court agreed that the American authorities had provided sufficient assurances over the conditions in which Aswat would be held in the US.’

Hate cleric Abu Hamza's son led kidnap gang who tortured man for three days over £15,000 debt.

Tito Ibn Sheikh, 28, was jailed for 12 years after a jury agreed he 'orchestrated the violence' inflicted on restaurant worker Hassan Monawwer over three days.

Mr Monawwer was knifed, strangled almost to death and battered with a metal bar and wooden cosh in three separate locations before armed police burst in to save him

Scammers: Hamza Mustafa Kamel, Mohamed Kamel Mostafa and Mohssin Ghailan, the three sons of jailed hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza who exploited a loophole in the vehicle registration system to steal luxury cars

Sheikh, who is one of nine children of Hamza, was convicted last year, but a judge banned reports on his family ties to avoid prejudicing jurors.

But last week after he and an accomplice unsuccessfully appealed their convictions the court lifted the gag allowing him to be named the the circumstances of the case revealed.

Sheikh and friends Adam Abed and Mostafa Dawoud snatched Mr Monawwer in Acton, west London, in 2012.

They subjected him to an ordeal of violence over £15,000 he was said to owe to Abed, the Sun on Sunday reports.

Yet in an effort to extort even more money, the trio told his family they would sell him to another gang unless they came up with £25,000 ransom.

Prosecutors said: 'His neck was squeezed so hard he thought his tongue would pop out.'

Hamza, 58, has nine children – six sons, two daughters and a stepson. Five of his sons are now known to have criminal records.

Mohammed Kamel Mostafa, Hamza's eldest son, was jailed for plotting to blow up British tourists. He was accused of masterminding a plot to sabotage economic and tourist sites in Yemen in August 1999, when he was just 17.

He returned to London in January 2002 after serving three years in prison in the Arab state. Six years later he was jailed again, along with his brother Hamza Mustafa Kamel and their step-brother Mohssin Ghailam.

The trio operated a £1million luxury car scam which involved exploiting a DVLA loophole to steal BMW, Mercedes and other luxury brand cars, which they then either sold on or used as collateral to make fraudulent loans.

Although they were investigated by anti-terror police there was no evidence they used the cash for terrorist purposes. 'They just used the cash to party,' a source said at the time.

In 2012, another of Hamza's sons, Imran Mostafa, was jailed after being convicted of armed robbery and illegal possession of a firearm over a smash and grab raid on a jewellers in King's Lynn, Norfolk.

Hamza himself faces life in jail in the U.S. after he was convicted of 11 terrorism charges. Meanwhile, his second wife Najat Mostafa, 55, mother of seven of his children, lives in a £1.25million five-bedroom council house in Shepherd’s Bush, West London.
