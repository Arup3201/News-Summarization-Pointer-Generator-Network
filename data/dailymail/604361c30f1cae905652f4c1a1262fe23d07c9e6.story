He might be a strapping 6ft 2" but compared to the man mountains who make up the England rugby side, Prince Harry is a mere minnow.

Perhaps with that in mind, Harry declined an invitation to show off his ball skills during a training session this morning and stayed safely on the sidelines instead.

Harry, who is vice patron of the English Rugby Football Union, was at Penny Hill Park in Surrey to wish the team luck ahead of their crunch match against France on Saturday.

Banter: Prince Harry shares a joke with England head coach Stuart Lancaster

Looking on: Harry chose stay on the sidelines during the training session

Standing with head coach Stuart Lancaster, the 30-year-old Prince exchanged quips with the players before watching the action in an official England jacket and jeans.

Despite his proficiency in the art of banter, Harry kept talk of tactics to a minimum, according to Lancaster.

'He was just there as a supporter to observe what we were doing,' said the England coach. 'There were no motivational talks.' 

Nevertheless, Harry will also at Twickenham for Saturday's match and will watch two girls' rugby teams from Reigate School and Quest Academy face off ahead of the main match.

Both schools are fielding teams under the auspices of the RFU's All Schools programme which aims to boost rugby in state schools.

Fan: Harry has long been a fan of rugby and is a familiar sight at Twickenham

Harry is patron of the programme, which he combines with his more formal role at rugby's governing body.

Although one of the most prominent royal rugby fans, the Prince is by no means the only one.

His brother Prince William is also a fan and enjoys a similar position at the Welsh RFU while the Princess Royal is patron of Scottish rugby and regularly appears at Murrayfield on match day.

This week's Six Nations clash with France is set to be particularly nerve-wracking for England fans, with Wales and Ireland also in contention for the trophy.

The last tournament before autumn's Rugby World Cup, all four home nations will be hoping to give their confidence a boost and take on the new challenge off the back of a win.

High hopes: England stars, among them Geoff Parling, are hoping to clinch victory against France

Competition: This weekend's crunch match could determine who wins this year's Six Nations
