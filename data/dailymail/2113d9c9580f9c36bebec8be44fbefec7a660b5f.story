Led Zeppelin are due to release a new version of their hit song Stairway to Heaven 40 years after it was first recorded 

An unreleased version of one of the most celebrated songs in rock, Stairway To Heaven, is to come out later this year after sitting in the vaults for more than 40 years.

An alternative take Stairway, one of Led Zeppelin’s most famous compositions, will be released on a new version of the band’s fourth album due out later this year.

Guitarist Jimmy Page has sifted through vintage studio recordings to find different versions of each of the eight tracks from the Led Zeppelin IV album - which first came out in 1971 - for a companion disc to accompany the reissue, part of a remastering of the band’s entire catalogue.

The soon-to-be released performance of Stairway dates from a series of mixing sessions at Sunset Sound Studio in Los Angeles. 

The version which was eventually released was completed at the Island Records studio in London.

Also to be issued the same day, October 27, is a remastered version of the group’s House Of The Holy album which again features newly heard takes of seven of the eight songs from that release.

New editions of the band’s first three albums came out last month.

Founding members of Led Zep - Page, singer Robert Plant and bass player John Paul Jones - famously reunited on stage in 2007 along with Jason Bonham, the son of late drummer John, at a tribute concert for Ahmet Ertegun, the founder of the band’s label Atlantic Records.

The song, one of the most played in rock music history, was initially conceived while Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page was staying an Bron Yr Aur cottage in Wales in 1970.

The introduction came to Page during the night, and after he played it to Plant the pair made a series of cassette recordings which would form the basis for the song.

The recording comes from a session the band did at Sunset Sound Studio in Los Angeles and will be released on a disc along with alternative recordings of all the tracks on Led Zeppelin IV

Today the cottage remains a pilgrimage for rock fans from across the world, who travel there in the hopes of looking around.

However Scott Roe, 42, the owner of the house, says he is fed up with metal enthusiasts disturbing their peace and quiet.

Mr Roe says one fan turned up having walked there from Germany, eating berries and sleeping in bushes as he went, while another stole the sign from outside his home after he refused to let him in.

Stairway to Heaven has consistently ranked among the greatest rock song of all time in magazine polls, and in the US alone it is estimated it had been played 2,874,000 times on radio, enough to last for 44 years if run back-to-back.

It is perhaps not surprising then that Jimmy Page once called an Oregon radio station during a charity drive and offered to donate $10,000 if they promised never to play the track again.

The song was also reportedly banned from some guitar shops after staff became sick of hearing people constantly playing it while trying out instruments.The ban was even referenced in 1992 film Wayne's World.

In 1982 the song fell foul of the backward masking 'scandal', as American TV stations alleged the song contained hidden satanic messages that could only be heard if it was played backwards.

Among the messages said to be hidden in Stairway To Heaven were 'Here's to my sweet Satan' and 'I sing because I live with Satan', which could allegedly be heard if the lyrics 'If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now...' were reversed.

According to Upstart, the song has earned an estimated $562million for the band and their record label to date, taking into account sales, royalties and downloads.

However Zeppelin have repeatedly refused to licence the song for advertising meaning the record could be worth far more than that figure.

Advertising experts told Upstart that, for just one campaign, Zeppelin could make around $8million, bringing the song's worth up to $570million.
