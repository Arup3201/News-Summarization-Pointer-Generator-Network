Meet Bertie the turbo tortoise, who can cover 18ft in a world record 19.59 seconds.

The young Leopard tortoise stunned spectators as he crossed the finish line in less than half the time as the previous record.

In fact before Bertie came along, the last tortoise to reach anywhere near was back in 1977 when Charlie set the record of 43.7 seconds.

Bertie the tortoise has broken the world record for an 18ft 'sprint', clocking a time of just 19.59 seconds - less than half the time of the previous world best - and even pulled a Usain Bolt pose afterwards

Bertie is a Leopard tortoise, thought to be nine years old, from Adventure Valley theme park in Durham

The tortoise, who lives at the 
Adventure Valley theme park in Durham, was placed on a specially-built 
18ft-long uphill course in front of crowds of visitors.

Despite
 fears he might get cold feet on the big day, Bertie, thought to be 
around nine-years-old, did not disappoint those who turned up to watch 
him rocket up the wooden track - even finishing with a victory wave as 
he crossed the chequered line.

Marco
 Calzini, owner of Adventure Valley, said: ‘Bertie loves going outside 
for a walk, as soon as we put him down he’s off and running.

‘Visitors are always remarking how fast he is. He’s like the Usain Bolt of the tortoise world.

‘Not
 only has he smashed the world record, he’s obliterated it completely. I
 think it will stand for a long time now, without a shadow of a doubt.’

On his first attempt he managed a time of 21.47 seconds, well under 
Charlie’s effort at the National Tortoise Championships 37 years 
previously.

And then - just to show off - he went on to shave a further two seconds off his time.

The previous world record of 43.7 seconds was set in 1977 by Charlie and remained unbroken fro 37 years

His keepers and officials from the Guinness Book of Records were there to keep a check on the race.

Bertie
 was given to the adventure park and animal farm three years ago when 
its owners went to live abroad. The park is always popular with visitors
 and it was they who first spotted his love of speed.

David
 Leon, of Partners Leisure, said: ‘He’d be put out for exercise and 
visitors would say “he can move; we didn’t realise tortoises could be 
that fast”. That started it.’

They checked the record books and, after a
 training programme that saw Bertie set a personal best of 20 seconds, 
decided to put him to the official test which meant strict regulations, 
adjudicators in place and stop-watches at the ready.

The
 course was made to the exact specifications of the original and 
included a slight gradient but Bertie, putting fellow animal residents 
to shame, sprinted off at a cracking pace.

Bertie has some way to go to beat the real Usain, however, who holds the world record for the sprint with a time of 9.58 seconds

He did two runs, first 
setting a time of 21 seconds then, confidence building, came his 
personal best.

At a third 
attempt he began to flag but by then he had earned his finishing-line 
treat which was a cut-up strawberry, a change from his regular grassy 
diet.

The farm is now 
awaiting an official certificate which will be displayed on a pen shared
 by Bertie and his female friend tortoise Shelly.

Mr Calzini said: ‘I’m so proud of him, so pleased. Now hopefully we will get that official recognition.’
