Gordon Brown was last night accused of having a 'perverted sense of reality' after claiming Britain would be like North Korea if it walked out of Europe.

Tory frontbencher Matt Hancock said the former prime minister was in danger of losing 'heads and hearts' by likening the UK outside the EU to Kim Jong Un's pariah state.

It came after Mr Brown made an impassioned plea for Britain to stay in the EU in what could be his last House of Commons speech yesterday evening.

The former PM had earlier claimed leaving Europe would leave the UK 'out in the cold with few friends' and 'no influence' like North Korea.

But replying for the Government in the debate, Mr Hancock told the Labour giant: 'Our country has been turned around and is being turned but our country will prosper whatever the institutional relationship with Europe.

'We are a brilliant country with the most enterprising and innovative people in the world, and it ill behoves anyone - least of all (Mr Brown) - to compare Britain's future to a brutal dictatorship like North Korea.

'And comparing Britain to North Korea shows a perverted sense of reality, and indeed you lose heads and hearts when you make such as comparison.'

Mr Brown had made the claim in a newspaper article published before last night's debate.

In the Commons Mr Brown claimed that Tory Eurosceptics and Ukip have instigated a 'culture war' urging disaffected Britons to blame foreigners for economic problems and so turning people against Europe.

The former prime minister railed against those on the right who have sought to address voters' concerns about globalisation by creating a 'siege mentality' that pits Britain against the continent, portraying support for Europe as unpatriotic.

In what is likely to be his Commons swansong, the Labour giant said the only way progressives can win the 'culture war' to keep Britain in the European Union is by winning hearts as well as minds.

Mr Brown cautioned against a 'London establishment-led, corporate financed' statistics-heavy campaign by 'elites' against leaving the EU as 'technical arguments are not enough to trump cultural grievances'.

Instead those who want to remain in the EU must passionately affirm that 'Britain is not Britain' unless it plays a leading role in shaping Europe, as it has for centuries - 'championing toleration, liberty and social responsibility' before any other country.

In a passionate speech which a handful of Tories attempted to derail with heckles about the former chancellor's record in government, Mr Brown called for Britain to lead a progressive movement in Europe to give globalisation 'a human face'.

He told the Commons: 'There is no doubt that millions of our fellow citizens feel more insecure than ever because of what is the bewildering pace and destructiveness of what to them often seems an out of control and uncontrollable global economy, and they are looking for someone or something to shelter, insulate, protect and cushion them from these bewildering, often alien forces that have taken their livelihoods on occasion from them.

Business minister Matt Hancock attacked Mr Brown in the Commons yesterday

'As they look for someone to hold responsible, and now they are being urged to turn what started off as economic protest, rather than a cultural prejudice, into a culture war - the main weapon of which is to blame foreigners, target immigrants and engender a siege mentality against the outsider.'

Mr Brown stressed the need for an emotional argument against Europe and a message that is bigger than the business case for staying in the EU.

He said: 'I have to say that in this culture war, arid statistics about exports and investment from a well-meaning, London establishment-led, corporate-financed campaign of 'the great and the good', who will be accused of being elites who don't understand Britain, will appear to many voters no match for the cultural charge from the right that Britain has ceased to be the Britain that they know and love.

'You cannot win in a culture war which asserts Britain is no longer a country you recognise just with fact sheets about the percentages of falls and rises in business investment. Technical arguments are not enough to trump cultural grievances.

'When you are fighting back in a culture war that others have started, you must take on strongly felt sets of beliefs with other strongly felt sets of beliefs.

'And if we are to win hearts as well as minds, our core message must be bigger than the business case, and bigger than even making the principled case for engagement.

'We must tell the British people not just about our patriotism and our historic role at the hinges of history but how through putting our enduring British values to work, we will lead in and shape the future of this continent.

'And that Britain which has always championed toleration, liberty and social responsibility before any country in Europe - and, as far back as the days of Adam Smith, invented the idea of civic society and mutual obligation, influencing Europe massively in the process - this Britain is ready once again to lead a progressive movement, mobilising Europe in what is the greatest challenge we face.

'To make the global economy and global change work for people, by tackling its injustices, its inequities and unfairness and by giving globalisation what it most needs now - a human face.'

Replying for the Government, Mr Hancock paid tribute to Mr Brown as 'a chancellor who dominated both the Treasury and this House and a prime minister who never gave less than his all in service of his nation'.

The Tory minister said: 'It falls to me to respond for the Government on this historic occasion of what may be the last speech in this House by you.

'Before responding in detail to the case you have made I think it's only right that the House acknowledge this moment.

'Since you entered this House in 1983 you have been a warrior for social justice, a master of the despatch box, a chancellor who dominated both the Treasury and this House and a prime minister who never gave less than his all in service of his nation.

'You have been a brilliant debater, besting Nigel Lawson in his prime, and humbling a long series of opponents throughout your career.'

But Mr Hancock criticised Mr Brown for standing against an in-out referendum on Britain's EU membership, as promised by the Conservatives.
