Sandwiches sold by leading High Street food chains contain as much salt as ten bags of crisps, health campaigners have warned.

A Peking duck wrap from EAT was found to contain 4.8g of salt, while a Swedish meatball hot wrap from Pret a Manger contained 4.6g of salt.

In contrast, a 32.5g bag of Walkers Ready Salted crisps contained less than 0.5g of salt.

High levels: A Swedish meatball hot wrap from Pret a Manger contained 4.6g of salt according to a study carried out by Consensus Action on Salt and Health

Tests: Study by Consensus Action on Salt and Health found high salt levels in more than half of 664 tested dishes. A Peking duck wrap from EAT was found to contain 4.8g of salt

Research by health campaigners found 
high salt levels – more than a third of the recommended daily intake – 
in over half of 664 tested dishes, with many restaurants as guilty as 
popular sandwich chains.

The
study published by Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash) found 
that three different dishes from Pizza Hut contained more than the 
entire maximum daily recommended allowance of 6g.

Average salt consumption in the UK is 8.1g a day.

Public
health minister Anna Soubry has called on food suppliers to cut the 
amount of salt they use to reduce deaths from heart disease and stroke.

The proposed strategy will create stricter salt limits for manufacturers of convenience foods such as sandwiches and microwave meals.

Meanwhile, fish and chip shops and other takeaway food outlets will be given maximum levels of salt that can be sprinkled on each serving in a bid to limit consumption.

The minister boasted that Britain is a
‘world-leader’ in salt reduction, with a 15 per cent drop in 
consumption in the past decade, but more ‘needs to be done to reach our 
goal of no more than 6g a day’.

Miss Soubry said: ‘We need more companies pledging to reduce salt levels, particularly in the catering and take away sector.

 ‘This
is because eating too much salt can have a serious impact on people’s 
health.’ The Department of Health wants more companies to sign up to its
salt-reduction strategy.

A spokesman for Pret said: ‘Pret is committed to meeting the Food Standard Agency’s targets.’

EAT has also signed the salt-reduction pledge.

‘It’s
a national scandal that there is still so much salt in our food,’ said 
Professor Graham MacGregor, of Cash. ‘Salt puts up our blood pressure, 
and as a result, thousands of people die unnecessarily each year from 
strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.’
