A street in Melbourne's CBD will transform into one of the world's longest slides following the success of a similar one in Perth.

It is believed more than 11,000 people lined up for their chance to slip and slide down St George's Terrace in the Western Australian capital last month.

This time Slide.Melbourne is organising the event and claims Melbourne's Lansdowne Street will be transformed into 'the longest city street slide anywhere in the world' on February 15 between the hours of 10am and 6pm.

It is believed more than 11,000 people lined up for their chance to slip and slide down St George's Terrace in the Western Australian capital last month (pictured above)

It promises to be three lanes wide and 400 metres long. 

But for those worried about water conservation, Slide.Melbourne guarantees no drop will go to waste.

Its 'Splashback Policy' outlines the slide's water consumption equals that of 400 showers.

The used water will then be recycled and used to keep Melbourne's gardens looking green. 

This time Slide.Melbourne is organising the event and claims Melbourne's Lansdowne Street will be transformed into 'the longest city street slide anywhere in the world' (similar to Perth one pictured above)

The Melbourne slide will take place on February 15 between the hours of 10am and 6pm

But it is also asking participants to do their bit as well.

'Imagine if on the day you slide with us, you promise to only have a two-minute shower,' Slide.Melbourne's website said.

'If you promise to do that then you and Slide.Melbourne could actually save over 100,000 litres of water.'

For a $40 and a 'small booking fee', sliders can get the most bang out of their buck for two hours.

Slide.Melbourne said ticket holders could fit in at least three slides in their session.
