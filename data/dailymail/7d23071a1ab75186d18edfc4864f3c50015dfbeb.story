Simon Cowell has told how impending fatherhod has changed his outlook on life and left him happier than ever.

The music mogul exclusively told Weekend magazine that news of girlfriend Lauren Silverman's pregnancy was 'like coming out of a fog' that made him feel low and lethargic.

He told the magazine: 'I'm having a baby and I never thought I would. And it totally changed everything.

Lauren Silverman's pregnancy has made him happier than ever

'It was like coming out of a fog; that’s 
the only way I can describe it. I thought, “Stop feeling sorry for 
yourself, you’ve got nothing to feel bad about.”

'It just makes you feel 
like you’ve got a responsibility. I definitely feel better.'

Speaking at his Los Angeles home, the X Factor creator told how he was at a low ebb before the baby and wasn't getting the same 'buzz' out of life.

Loved up: Simon and Lauren in St. Tropez in August

But while he admits that the circumstances surrounding Lauren's pregnancy made him feel 'uncomfortable' - she was married to his good friend Andrew Silverman - things are now looking up.

Not only is Ms Silverman expecting a baby son in February, but his company Syco Entertainment continues to thrive.

His X Factor boyband One Direction is currently  topping charts all over the globe with a new album and the band's film, This Is Us, has grossed £50million worldwide.

And the Cowell juggernaut shows no signs of letting up.

The X Factor is to spawn a West End musical called I Can't Sing!, penned by comedian Harry Hill and described by Cowell as 'really funny'.

He also defends the show from critics within the music industry who sneer at the chance the show gives to performers who may otherwise not hit the big time.

As well as babies, Cowell hinted at a possible X Factor return for Cheryl Cole after the pair's acrimonious falling out following her shortlived stint on the show's US version.

With rumours abound as to his own return to the UK judging panel with Gary Barlow and Louis Walsh set to leave, Simon also discussed whether he will take up a vacant spot on the show he describes as his 'baby' himself.

As well as the obvious Press attention that comes hand in hand with success, Cowell also tells all about the other loves in his life - his two terriers.
