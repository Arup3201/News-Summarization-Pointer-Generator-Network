An ex-rugby league player died following a struggle with police after he fell from a hotel balcony in Spain.

Luke Rhoden, 25, died from a cardiac arrest after being restrained by officers on the party island of Ibiza.

Police said Mr Rhoden fell from a first-floor balcony at the Ibiza Rocks Hotel in the resort of San Antonio last night.

He then picked himself up before running through the hotel screaming 'someone's trying to kill me', a police source said.

Officers from the Civil Guard restrained him and put him into an ambulance to be sedated.

Rumours circulated on Twitter that Mr Rhoden had been beaten up by police before his death.

But a Civil Guard source said: 'Our officers do not beat people up.

'They restrained him for his own safety and helped him into the ambulance where he was sedated.'

Paramedics spent 40 minutes trying to revive Mr Rhoden but he died at the scene.

Police were called to the hotel after Mr Rhoden plunged from the balcony at around 10.30pm last night.

The police source said: 'He was acting wildly and from his behaviour we believe he may have been taking drugs.

'He was a guest at the hotel. He jumped from the hotel balcony onto a patio below, then picked himself up and ran through the hotel screaming like a madman that someone was trying to kill him.

'Our officers restrained him for his own safety and put him into an ambulance so he could be sedated.

'The paramedics tried to revive him but he died in the ambulance. An autopsy will reveal the cause of death.'

The autopsy will also determine whether Mr Rhoden had been taking drugs.

Mr Rhoden, from Wigan, played prop forward as a junior for rugby league side Wigan Warriors and for England's under 17 side.

Staff from Ibiza Rocks were today comforting friends and family at the hotel.

A source at the hotel said: 'Mr Rhoden's a big, big guy and it took a lot to restrain him.

'Several of our staff witnessed him being restrained but nobody has reported seeing the police use excessive force or beating him.

'He had fallen from a balcony and then made his way through public areas of the hotel acting very strangely.

'He made it out into the street where the police took over.'

A spokesman for the hotel said: 'We can confirm there was a fatality in Ibiza last night and our sincerest and heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends of the individual concerned at this very difficult time.

'We continue to assist the Spanish Police with their investigation and cannot make further comment about the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident until a full enquiry into the cause of death is complete.'

Thomas Brindle wrote on Twitter: 'I am devastated to hear the news about Luke Rhoden, former team mate and top bloke.

'Very sad times. RIP.' 

British consular staff were today offering assistance to family members.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza on 3 September.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

This summer tourists were warned of a dangerous new mind-bending drug circulating on the island said to send some users into a crazed rage.

The drug, known as bath salts or 'cannibal', contains the powerful stimulant MDVP. 

His former club Wigan Warriors said: 'Wigan Warriors are saddened to hear of the death of former youth player Luke Rhoden.

'Having come through the club's scholarship system Luke played for the Warriors academy in 2007 and 2008 before moving on to play semi-professionally at Oldham.'
