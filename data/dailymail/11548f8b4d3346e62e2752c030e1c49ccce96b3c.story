Seven months after revealing she had been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer, former Good Morning America host Joan Lunden has urged all other women suffering from the disease to remain positive about their prognosis.

'I'll tell you. One of the best ways to get through it is with your attitude,' Lunden told the Today show's Matt Lauer about beginning radiation treatment this month.

The former TV anchor, 64, appeared on the morning show on Tuesday in order to share an emotional update about her treatment, following the lumpectomy and 16 rounds of chemotherapy she completed in 2014.

Ms Lunden, who is currently undergoing radiation treatment five days a week, admitted that she was hesitant to mention the tremendous amount of support she has received from her husband and older daughters. 

She explained that fans often write to her to remind her that they have no one and it saddens them to hear about her family's role in her recovery.

'When you say that to me, I cry,' she said of the letters. 'But it's a good reminder for me because I have kind of been thrust out there, in the front of this breast cancer, to be a voice for everyone.'

The author and breast cancer advocate said that after finishing her last round of chemotherapy on December 3 she finally feels like she is nearing the end of her battle with the disease. 

'This is the very very first time that I have been close enough to the finish line to actually feel like I can see the finish line,' she said of her ongoing treatments. 'You know for me - and everyone is different - radiation is a walk in the park after chemo.'

Ms Lunden was in great spirits and jokingly told Mr Lauer: 'You have more hair than I do. That is not fair.'

'I don't get that very often,' the Today Show co-anchor replied with a laugh.

She also noted that she is starting to see signs of recovery.  

'I am starting to get eyelashes again... They are tiny, but they are growing back out.'

Ms Lunden, who was happy to report that she felt strong enough to travel with her family over the holiday, said it was important to keep a sense of normalcy for both her and her loved ones.

'I want [my children] to be able to get up in the morning and go to school and not thinking: "Gosh, is mommy going to be okay? Is she going to live?" I try to be as normal as I can.'

She said that she hears from women who are bald and admit that they wear sweats and no longer put on makeup – and she urged them to try and get out and to spend as much time with other people as possible  

'You can kind of get burrowed down in that and become the sick cancer patient,' she said. 

Ms Lunden added: 'Be with people. Go out to a movie. Laugh, find ways to laugh.'

She also advised women to adjust their attitudes so one bad day doesn't turn into a bad month.   

'All of a sudden, somebody is woe is me, and it is very easy to let one bad day do that to you,' she said. 'But we have the ability at any moment in time to change your mind about how you are feeling that day.'

She noted: 'Even if you are feel a little crummy, just remember that what we are going through that makes us feel crummy one day is killing off all the cancer in our bodies.'

After she completes radiation, Ms Lunden said she has to wait three month before getting her first mammogram, ultrasound and MRI checkup.

'My prognosis is good,' she said, before adding: 'By the way, all of you who are writing me, you have no idea what it means to me, the strength that [you've] given to me.'
