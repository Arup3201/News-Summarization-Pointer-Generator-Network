It was put on the market as a sign of solidarity by the king, to show his appreciation for the harsh austerity measures and rising unemployment rates facing his fellow Spaniards.

But it seems times are so austere that those selling King Juan Carlos's luxury royal yacht have had to slash its asking price - by nearly 20 per cent.

Fortuna, a
 136ft motor boat used exclusively by the Spanish Royal Family 
and their guests - which has in the past included Princess Diana and Prince Charles - has had its price dropped from £8.1m to £6.6m.

Reduced: Fortuna, the luxury royal yacht used exclusively by the Spanish Royal 
Family, is on the market for £6.6m (€8.25) after King Juan Carlos decided to give 
it up in a show of solidarity as Spain battled high levels of 
unemployment and austerity

Famous faces: The boat has played host to several famous faces, including Princess 
Diana, Prince Charles and Prince William, pictured here with King Juan 
Carlos in 1990

The boat, which remains moored off the island of Majorca, where the royal family has a palace and goes on holiday each summer, was gifted to the state by around 30 executives with 
links to Majorca and other Balearic Islands in a bid to promote
 the islands.

But King Juan Carlos - who announced last week that he plans to abdicate to make way for his son Prince Felipe - was forced to renounce the use of the yacht, after coming under fire for going on an elephant safari in Bostwana in 2012, while the Spanish economy plunged further into crisis.

The holiday came just weeks after the monarch - who won wide respect in Spain for helping guide it through a political transition after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975 - claimed to be 'kept awake at night by the plight of the Spain's youth unemployed'.

But after the king announced he would 
hand over his prized possession, the group who bestowed the yacht, the Foundation of Balearic Culture and Tourism, said 
they wanted it back.

In a letter explaining their claim, they stressed 
that the gift had been given with the understanding that the yacht be 
used exclusively by the royal family.

Now the 140-tonne vessel, which was 
originally put on the market for the equivalent of €10m, has been 
reduced to €8.25m.

Spotted: Diana was seen on board the boat, which was bestowed to the king by the Foundation of Balearic Culture and Tourism in a bid to encourage tourism in the islands. When he announced he was giving up the boat, the state returned it to the foundation which put it up for sale

Smiles: King Constantine II of Greece, Princess Theodora of Greece, Princess Diana and King Juan Carlos enjoyed a summer holiday on the yacht in 1990 in 
Majorca, Spain

Happy families: King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, Prince Felipe - who is due to take over from his father imminently - and wife Princess 
Letizia, plus all the Spanish Royal family members were often seen boating on the yacht. In this picture, they enjoyed a trip around the 
Balearic Islands

The queens: Queen-in-waiting Princess Letizia, left, and Queen Sofia of Spain, right, were pictured on board the 
royal yacht in 2006 with Princess Leonor as they attended the Copa del 
Rey sailing trophy

Arrival Yachts, the agency managing the sale, said the price had been dropped as part of its strategy to indicate the seller's wish to negotiate and not because there was a lack of interest. It said all serious offers would now be considered.

The boat, which is said to be more like an aircraft in design, was named as the fastest in the world of its type in 2000 when it reached 68 knots.

As
 well as a plush interior and a lavish deck which boasts 360 degree views
 out to sea, anyone buying the boat will also be able to count 
themselves in good company.

Inside: The 140-tonne vessel was named as the fastest in the world of its type in 2000 - when it reached 68 knots. It is said to be more like an aircraft in its design and represents 'the pinnacle' of this type of yacht, which includes a lavish interior

The master bedroom on the yacht, which is one of four cabins equipped 
with an en-suite, is large and benefits from good sound-proofing. There is also a large, flat-screen television, a music
 system and a host of other mod-cons inside the royal yacht

The boat, which is stored in a special dock shed in Palma, was also 
built with a bullet-proof structure and was deemed to be the most 
advanced of its type in the world when it was made

The spacious boat has been managed by a highly-specialised crew, personalised for the king, who have kept the boat up to date with all the latest and best equipment

It has been at the centre of several 
glamorous photo opportunities over the years - perhaps most memorably of
 a windswept Princess Diana and Prince Charles sunning themselves 
alongside the Spanish king.

Glamorous
 Princess Letizia, the queen-in-waiting, and the rest of the royal 
family are also regularly spotted on the yacht during the summer months.

The boat includes an 
interior which was created by Milan-based designer Celeste Della Anna, 
which includes panelled  wood with stitched tan leather, a beige carpet 
with Japanese accents and cream-coloured ceilings.

Nigel Evans from Arrival Yachts, which is marketing the yacht, which 
includes this kitchen, said it had been specially-designed to minimise 
noise and vibration from its 20,000 horsepower engine

It
 also has four cabins which sleep eight people, all equipped with luxury
 en-suites, as well as a spacious flybridge, protected by a wraparound 
windscreen.

There is also a large, flat screen 
television, a music system and other mod-cons such as an ice maker and a
 dough mixing machine for bread.

The
 boat, which is stored in a special dock shed in Palma, also benefits 
from a bullet-proof structure and was deemed to be the most advanced of 
its type in the world when it was made.

 years, is moored off the island of Majorca

The moment he gave it all up: The Spanish king, pictured right, was forced to renounce the boat after 
he came under fire for enjoying an elephant safari in Botswana in April 2012 as his 
country fought some of the highest unemployment levels in its history

Bulletproof exterior

Measures 136ft

Weighs 140 tonnes

20,000 horsepower engine

Three turbines

Nigel Wales from the company said it was also managed by a highly-specialised crew who have kept the boat up to date with all the latest and top-of-the-range equipment.

He said: 'The recent reduction in price is part of our strategy to first locate the vessel in the market, then indicate to potential buyers the seller’s wish to negotiate.Hence the reduction from €10m to €8.25m.

'The quality of construction the yacht is similar to that of an aircraft, as you would imagine when the hull is designed to handle over 20,000 horsepower with all three turbines at full power.

'The yacht represented the pinnacle of design for this type of vessel, in terms of performance whilst minimising noise and vibration, for the client’s enjoyment.

'As a qualified naval architect I am proud to be representing ‘Foners’, which obviously helps when talking to potential clients and brokers.'
