Maryland authorities plan to prosecute a man for allegedly urinating on the grave of former Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell.

The man, who has been identified only as a Cleveland Browns fan, will be charged with disorderly conduct in a cemetery.

He posted a video of the incident to YouTube this month where he relieved himself on the gravestone while wearing his Browns jersey.

Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger said the man will not be identified until charges are filed and served.

He could face up to two years in jail and a $500 fine.

Art Modell died in 2012 at the age of 87. He spent 43 years as an NFL owner, overseeing the Browns from 1961 until he moved the team to Baltimore in 1996 to become the Ravens.

Modell and his wife, Patricia, are buried in Baltimore at Druid Ridge Cemetery.

David Modell, Art Modell's son, told ESPN the family is thankful for the efforts of the police and the decision to file charges.

He said: 'We also agree with the state's attorney's office that everyone who has buried a loved one has the right to know that the final resting place will not be defiled.'

Outrage over the offensive video has spread beyond the football community.

DeMario Tucker commented on the YouTube video: 'Ignorant!! but what do you expected from Cleveland fans and people in general.ï»¿'

Scott Eisen wrote: 'Cleveland is a classless, ungrateful sports town. that guy has issues. a bitter loser sports fan.'

Shawn Rollins added: 'Way to keep it classy. Respect everyone.'
