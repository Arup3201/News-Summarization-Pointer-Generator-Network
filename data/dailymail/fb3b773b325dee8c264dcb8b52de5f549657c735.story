Prosecutors have called for the death penalty in the horrific case of the Muslim ex-convict accused of beheading a female coworker at the processing plant where they were employed.

Alton Nolen, from Moore, Oklahoma, was formally charged with first-degree murder and assault on Tuesday after he was released from hospital.

He stands accused of cutting off the head of his former colleague in a bloody rampage hours after he was dismissed from his job at Vaughan Foods for racial comments.

He pleaded not guilty in court to both charges and was ordered held without bond.

'Appropriate': District Attorney Greg Mashburn met with the victim's family before deciding to seek the penalty

Victims: Nolen allegedly tried to behead coworker Traci Johnson (left) after co-worker Colleen Hufford (right)

The Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn said he waited to discuss the decision with the family of killed worker Traci Johnson before he sought the death penalty.

'I let them know it was my ultimate decision, but I wanted to know their feelings,' he told The Oklahoman. 

He said the family felt it would be appropriate, and the paperwork has now been submitted. 

Authorities say the attack, which happened last Thursday, appears to have been an act of revenge for a complaint made by Ms Johnson that got him suspended earlier in the day.

According to reports, Ms Johnson complained to human resources at the Vaughan Foods plant after the two allegedly had a fight 'about him not liking white people.'

After being sent home, Nolen reportedly got a knife, hiding it in his shoe when he returned to the plant.

He then entered the administrative office, where he allegedly beheaded 54-year-old grandmother Colleen Hufford.

He then turned his attention to Johnson, and 'cut her across the throat and left side of her face.'

DA Mashburn said he sought the death penalty on the grounds that the victim’s death was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel. 

He said he also will allege Nolen is a continuing threat to society, and he put more than one person at great risk of death.

The fourth 'aggravating circumstance' in Mashburn's report reminds that Nolen has been previously convicted of a felony involving violence against a person.

An affidavit states that he later told police he was trying to behead her as well.

The company's chief operating officer, Mark Vaughan, a reserve sheriff's deputy in Oklahoma City, then leveled a rifle at Nolen and fired, striking him once and stopping the attack.

Nolen had been hospitalized from the wounds he suffered during this shooting until earlier today. 

The FBI is also investigating the attack, given Nolen's interest in beheadings and a recent surge in Middle East violence. 

Oklahoma prison records show Nolen was released from prison in March 2013 after serving two years of a six-year sentence on charges that included assaulting a police officer and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.
