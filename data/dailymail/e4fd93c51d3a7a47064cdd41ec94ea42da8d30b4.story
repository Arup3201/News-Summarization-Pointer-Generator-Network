A British woman was spared further prison time by U.S. court after admitting to a fraud charge.

Sandra Dunham, 58, pleaded guilty in December 2014 after she and her husband Paul lost a High Court battle against extradition the previous April.

They had to be taken to Northampton General Hospital in May after taking drug overdoses the night before they were supposed to hand themselves in to police and U.S. marshals.

The Couple were flown to the U.S. from Heathrow Airport in May after a Senior District Judge  at Westminster Magistrates' Court concluded it was a deliberate attempt to avoid or delay extradition.

The couple admitted to conspiring to commit wire fraud in a scheme where they fraudulently requested financial reimbursement from their employer for a number of items.

Spared: Sandra Dunham (pictured) was sentenced in Maryland District Court to 30 days of imprisonment with credit for time already served in custody, her UK-based solicitor said

Fraud: Sandra's husband Paul (pictured) faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison after also admitting to money laundering offences

Massive losses: The Dunham's (pictured) fraudulently charged personal expenses to corporate credit card

Those included mortgage payments on time-shares in Barbados, luxury bedding for their home, a dog sofa  and other personal expenses. 

Mr Dunham, 59, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy and money laundering, to which he also pleaded guilty.

The couple's UK-based solicitor, Michael Evans, said: 'Sandra Dunham, as part of a plea agreement with the US prosecutor, has today been sentenced in Maryland District Court to 30 days of imprisonment with credit for time already served in custody.

'In practice Sandra therefore has 18 days of home confinement before she returns to the UK during the third week of February.

'We look forward to her safe return to the UK and await the outcome of the sentencing of Mr Dunham which has been delayed until next Thursday, 5 February.' 

The solicitor said Mrs Dunham has pleaded at US District Court, Greenbelt, Maryland to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

The seven wire fraud counts on the indictment leading to her extradition were dismissed.

According to their pleas, the defendants worked for Pace Worldwide, which was located in Maryland and North Carolina at various times. It had a subsidiary in the United Kingdom named Pace Europe Ltd.

Pace produced parts used to repair and rework electronics for the military. Mr Dunham held a number of executive positions in the company which included president and chief operating officer. 

Mrs Dunham was initially hired to work for the European subsidiary in the accounts department before eventually becoming Pace Worldwide's director of sales and marketing.

The Dunhams were provided with corporate credit cards when they moved from the UK to Maryland and then North Carolina.

Between 2002 and 2009, they fraudulently charged personal expenses to their corporate credit cards.

They then submitted reimbursement vouchers to Pace which falsely described the expenditures as business expenses, the statement said.

As a result of the lengthy scheme, one million dollars (£635,500) in actual losses were incurred.
