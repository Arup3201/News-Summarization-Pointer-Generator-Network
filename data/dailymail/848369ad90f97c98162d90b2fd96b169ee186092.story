The family of an American prisoner-of-war captured four years ago in Afghanistan have been given new hope after receiving a letter they believe was written by him.

Sgt Bowe Bergdahl of Hailey, Idaho, disappeared from his base in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009, and is believed to be in Pakistan.

His mother and father in Idaho issued a statement on Thursday saying they've received a letter they are confident was written by their 27-year-old son.

In the statement, Bob and Jani Bergdahl say the letter, delivered through the International Committee of the Red Cross, gives them hope that their son is doing as well as can be expected in the circumstances.

They thanked the Red Cross for its help and support - and renewed their plea for his captors to release him.

Dwight Murphy, with the Boise Valley POW/MIA, told KTVB he had an email from Mr Bergdahl saying that the family had no doubt after the letter that Bowe was alive as of two months ago.

The family were being extremely cautious due to the highly volatile situation their son is in. It is thought that the 27-year-old is being held by the Pakistan-based Haqqani terrorist organization.

Mr Murphy, who along with Bowe's father refuses to cut his beard until the soldier is found, added: That [the letter] brings new found hope.

'That's like 
sitting around a camp fire that's going out and all of a sudden you find
 that one more log to keep the fire going.'

The Bergdahl family have organized a tree planting ceremony in honor of their missing son on 
June 22 at Hop Porter Park in Hailey to publicize their cause.

The International 
Committee of the Red Cross explained their role today when it comes to communicating with detainees.

In a statement to MailOnline the ICRC: 'As part of its humanitarian mandate, the ICRC facilitates contact between detainees and their families across Afghanistan and even beyond the country.

#We do so for detainees in Afghan prisons, for persons held by foreign forces but also for persons held by the armed opposition groups. The Red Cross Message service is available to all concerned families and the family of Sergeant Bergdahl has used this service.

To give you a sense of scale, we distribute some 25,000 humanitarian letters of this kind every year in Afghanistan alone. To achieve this result, we have regular contacts with all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan who accept the ICRC's role as a neutral intermediary.

As regards dates of transmission and addressees of individual letters, you will understand that in the interest of the concerned detainees and families, we prefer not to share such details. Doing so might also jeopardize the trust agreement we have with the parties to the conflict.'

Optimism: Bowe's parents Robert (left) and Jani with Dwight Murphy (center) from the Boise Valley POW Committee. Murphy said the letter had brought everyone's spirits up

The young sergeant's father told the New York Times last year that he was exasperated and lacking in confidence in the Obama administration in bringing his son home.

While imprisoned, Sgt Bergdahl has appeared in a least five Taliban propaganda videos.

The U.S. State Department had not responded to MailOnline's request for comment on the reported letter at the time of publication.

Sgt Bergdahl is believed to have made a daring escape attempt in 2011. He jumped from a 
first-floor window of a mud-brick house in Pakistan where he was being 
held, and made his escape into underbrush and forested mountains.

His captors found him three days later hiding in a trench, covered with leaves and virtually naked, according to the report.

The sources described Sgt Bergdahl, as fighting 'like a boxer' when found.
