GCSE English pupils have been harshly graded following sweeping reforms, furious teachers claimed last night.

With more than 600,000 teenagers collecting their results today, head teachers are warning of  ‘surprises’ in English that have seen wild swings in grades compared with last year.

Head teachers receive GCSE results a day before their pupils, and one said she was ‘absolutely furious’ that her school had seen a drop of 18 percentage points in the proportion of pupils getting at least a grade C.

There are also concerns about maths which, with English, is central to pupils’ chances of getting into sixth-forms and landing jobs.

There have been particular concerns about English tests, with teachers complaining of 'very tough' pass marks

With a series of Coalition reforms converging on GCSEs this year, results will be the most ‘volatile’ in the exam’s history. Headline pass rates are expected to edge up after rules were introduced which discourage schools from entering pupils for GCSEs a year or two early.

But schools which ‘gamed’ the system by giving over-generous marks on teacher assessments and entering pupils for exams multiple times face a ‘sharp shock’, it was claimed.

There were particular concerns about English, with heads complaining of ‘very tough’ pass marks.

It follows changes to GCSE English aimed at cracking down on teacher assessments, which exam chiefs suspected were marked too generously.

Oral presentations assessed by teachers are no longer counted towards the final grade, while written exams account for 60 per cent of the total instead of 40 per cent.

Any drop in English results piles pressure on schools which are required to meet basic ‘floor’ standards or face being forcibly taken over by outside sponsors. One head told the TES teachers’ journal that her school had seen a drop of 18 percentage points in the proportion of students achieving at least a grade C in English. ‘We’re absolutely furious. Our overall results are now below the floor target and it’s all down to English. The kids are going to be distraught,’ she said.

Heads took to Twitter to warn that ‘English looks very tough this year’. One tweeted: ‘Some shocking stories emerging from schools about way-below outcomes against predictions.’ Another added: ‘The world has gone truly mad.’

Brian Lightman, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said several union members had come forward with concerns about ‘surprises’ in their grades.

‘Clearly some schools have had some surprises,’ he said. ‘English is the main one, and we’re also hearing about some surprises in maths.’

Bill Watkin, operational director at the SSAT schools network, described reports from schools so far as a ‘mixed picture’. He added: ‘Unsurprisingly if you’ve got more rigorous courses followed by more rigorous tests, teachers can do the same job that they’ve been doing all along but get slightly lower results.’

Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment at Buckingham University, said: ‘Individual schools are likely to be affected differently according to how much they relied on gaming the old system, so for some there could be sharp shocks in store.’

In an open letter to schools, Ofqual said: ‘Our priority this summer, as in previous years, is to hold standards steady so that in general, students in 2014 are not advantaged or disadvantaged because of the changes.’
