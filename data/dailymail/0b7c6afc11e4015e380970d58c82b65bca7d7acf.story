More than 40 ‘predatory’ foreign rapists were able to enter Britain in a single year undetected, police have revealed.

Scotland Yard said the dangerous criminals were only uncovered thanks to a drive to discover the backgrounds of overseas suspects.

Officers said improved checks revealed a previously undiscovered stream of foreigners with a history of serious crime.

Staggering: Scotland Yard has found that there are more than 40 'predatory rapists' living in London who have already been convicted abroad of sex crimes

As a result police have pledged to 
throw hundreds of foreign suspects out of the country every week, even 
when they have not been convicted of a crime.

Immigration judges will be asked to 
deport rapists, thugs and thieves on the strength of ‘intelligence 
dossiers’ collected by investigators.

Serious offenders can be thrown out 
even when they have not been convicted if an immigration tribunal deems 
them a danger to the public.

In one recent case a 46-year-old 
Jamaican drug addict rapist was thrown out of the country after being 
linked to a string of sexual offences in South London.

Despite remaining unconvicted, an immigration tribunal ruled Lincoln Farquharson was a danger to the public and deported him.

One in three arrested in the capital – around 70,000 people every year – is a foreign national.

Metropolitan Police Commander Steve 
Rodhouse said police are working with immigration officials to 
investigate the past of all foreign suspects.

He said: ‘Our work gives us much 
better knowledge of those people in the UK and how they are offending. 
We have identified more than 40 predatory rapists convicted overseas in 
the UK who we would otherwise not been aware of.

‘These are people who are getting arrested for low level crimes like shoplifting and are exposed after further checks.’

Kicked out: Jamaican Lincoln Farquharson had been charged with multiple rape and has been deported and banned from returning to the UK for at least 10 years.

Top officers at Britain’s largest 
force are concerned that a quarter of those arrested for serious crimes 
and links to gangs are foreign.

They are stepping up their efforts to 
deport foreign criminals and hope to increase the number from between 30
and 50 a week to ‘three figures’.

Police have set up a 100-strong squad,
including officials from the UK Border Agency, to target foreign 
nationals committing crime in the capital. They have also won funding 
for up to eight Romanian and Polish liaison officers.

Assistant 
Commissioner Mark Rowley said the Met is ‘determined and creative’ about
protecting the public.

He said immigration laws are a 
‘powerful way’ of kicking out criminal suspects who escape deportation 
because they are not successfully prosecuted.

He added: ‘When we are able to 
prosecute that is what we do but in many cases prosecutions are not 
possible for a range of reasons or have failed.

‘What we are able to do through this 
method is present a case to an immigration tribunal that will show their
lifestyle in the UK and the threat they pose.’

Last year just over 72,500 foreign 
suspects were held by the Met and questioned about crimes including 
murder, rape and robbery. The figure was up almost a quarter on three 
years ago when 58,870 non-British suspects were arrested in London.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said:
‘We will use the full force of immigration powers on those who seek to 
abuse the system, commit crime and damage our communities. The success 
of this operation proves foreign nationals who continue to offend and 
pose a threat to the public will be arrested and removed from the UK.’
