An Indian diplomat accused of lying about how much she paid her housekeeper was indicted on Thursday on two criminal charges, though prosecutors told a judge that she had been granted diplomatic immunity and left the country earlier in the day.

Devyani Khobragade was charged by a federal grand jury in Manhattan with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered an outcry in India.

She's accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper.

The indictment said Khobragade had made or multiple false representations to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a personal domestic worker.

Devyani Khobragade was charged with visa fraud and making false statements. She faces prosecution if she returns to the States and has expressed her fear that she may never live with her husband and two daughters - who remain in New York - as family again.

She planned to bring the worker to the 
United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General
 of India in New York, according to the indictment.

Khobragade,
 39, India's deputy consul general in New York, has maintained her 
innocence to accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 
per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage.

Her
 arrest last month sparked outrage in India after revelations that she 
was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants 
before being released on $250,000 bail.

In
 a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an 
arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic
 immunity status and left the United States on Thursday.

The
 letter said the charges will remain pending until she can be brought to
 court to face them, either through a waiver of immunity or her return 
to the U.S. without immunity status.

'We
 will alert the court promptly if we learn that the defendant returns to
 the United States in a non-immune capacity, at which time the 
government will proceed to prosecute this case and prove the charges in 
the indictment,' the letter from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet 
Bharara said.

However Khobragade's lawyer said today that she is still in the U.S., despite a prosecutor's claim that she left.

Attorney Daniel Arshack said in a statement on Thursday that his client was at her New York City apartment.

Shortly after he issued the statement, a spokesman for federal prosecutors said the State Department had told prosecutors that it had asked her to leave the country on Thursday afternoon.

Devyani Khobragade was arrested last 
month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her 
housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour

In an 
unusual statement last month, U.S. Attorney Bharara responded to 
what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case 
by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying 
to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a 
housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was 
contracted to work.

He also 
questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment 
of the Indian housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about 
the alleged treatment of Khobragade.

He
 said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect 
victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal
 status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are'.

These
 developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on 
behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions.

Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York

Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in 
July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. 

Mr Richard also said the consular 
official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family 
saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug 
charges.

In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com,
 a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani 
Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions 
or keeping a person in bondage.'

The
 petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family 
several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire 
consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get 
them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.'

Mr
 Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in 
front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of 
what the woman took.

Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also 
wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and 
wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go.

Mr Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, 
because the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on 
foreign soil'.
