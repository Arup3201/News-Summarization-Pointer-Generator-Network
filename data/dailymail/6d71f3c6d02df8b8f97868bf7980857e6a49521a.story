Troubles continue for Vernon Winfrey, the 79-year-old father of talk show host Oprah, as he reported to a Tennessee court that he has overdrawn at his bank.

Mr Winfrey is in the midst of a contentious divorce from his third wife Barbara , who claims that he both cheated on her and made threats to kill her.

Now Mr Winfrey is returning with accusations that Barbara, who is asking for spousal support, makes far more than the $282.33 he makes per month.

Barbara told The Tennessean that in addition to the salary he earns from his barbershop, Vernon also receives $25,000 ‘every three months from a trust funded by his daughter’.

Barbara hopes to have Vernon pay for their mutual bills and expenses for the duration of the trial, which given the many areas of disagreement, may go on for some time.

She also claims that her husband conspired with his billionaire daughter to have her thrown out of their home in East Nashville, Tennessee even though she has nowhere to go.

Another aspect of the case is the supposed violent threats that Vernon made to Barbara over the course of their 12-year marriage, including one occasion where her husband 'became angered at her, chased her with a gun and threatened to shoot her.

She also claims he had 'more than one adulterous relationship'..

The accusations were made in a counterclaim after Vernon Winfrey filed for divorce from his third wife on June 22, just five days after their 12th anniversary.

He claimed that his 64-year-old wife was 'guilty of inappropriate marital conduct' and cited irreconcilable differences. She denies the claims.

The couple lived together in the gated Laurel Brooke subdivision in Williamson County’s Grassland community, according to the Tennessean, in a property worth almost $1.5million.

But because the home is titled in Oprah's name, both she and her father have been trying to force Barbara - who is seeking alimony support - out of the marital home even though she has nowhere to go, according to the court papers.

The store in Nashville, Tennessee, was bought by Oprah last week for $475,000.

Barbara Winfrey said the purchase means the chat show host, who now runs her own TV network, has gained control of the business and cut her out.

‘I know what is going on. I'm tired of it, and I've had enough,’ Barbara Winfrey told WSMV TV in Nashville.

On the same day Oprah bought the property, Williamson County Sheriff’s officials responded to a call from Barbara who said Vernon and an 'entourage of his friends' had shown up at her home.

Barbara told the local media that Oprah was controlling her father.

‘He believes what he's told. His daughter doesn't care about the community. His daughter doesn't care about the barbershop. But I do,’ she said.

WSMV said they had confirmed that Oprah, who is worth an estimated $2.7billion, paid $475,000 for the barber shop.

In a statement to the TV station a spokesman for Oprah said: ‘Oprah purchased the property that was in foreclosure.

‘Vernon Winfrey has been a fixture in the community for decades and will continue to manage the business on a day-to-day basis.’

In a telephone call to the TV station Vernon said: ‘My wife and I, we have not been getting along well, and I did not want to endow myself to another drawn-out, struggling debt.’

Vernon, a former town council official, has run a barbershop in East Nashville for 50 years.

He moved from the old premises in 2011 and the new salon had a boxing theme.

At the opening of the new barber shop Vernon said the premises would be his legacy to the community.

‘When I'm gone, I'm glad I'll be able to say I left the neighborhood looking nice,’ Winfrey said.

He said his daughter had urged him to give up cutting hair, but he planned to continue.

‘Some folks say, “Winfrey, you're kind of old to be doing it.” I say, “You're right, but I feel good,”’ he said.
