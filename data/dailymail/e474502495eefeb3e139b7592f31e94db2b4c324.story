Police in India are hunting a man-eating tiger that is believed to have killed four villagers in 12 daysÂ  after escaping from an animal reserve.

The latest victim was a 40-year-old woman who was attacked on Wednesday in a village in the Moradabad district of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

It is believed to have strayed from the nearby Jim Corbett National Park which covers an area of over 200 square miles and is is home to an estimated 200 tigers.

Forest officials have recruited two elephants in their efforts to track down the tiger which they hope to drive back towards the national park.

A state government spokesman said: 'We have identified four bodies that were killed by the tiger as they bore teeth and claw marks.

'We have launched a thorough search and hope it will go back to its natural habitat.'

Angry villagers have accused authorities of not acting quickly enough to capture the animal after the first death was reported at the end of last month.

Moves are underway to have the animal categorised as a 'man-eater' meaning it can be legally killed.

India is home to some 1,700 tigers - half of the world's rapidly shrinking wild tiger population - but has been struggling to halt the big cat's decline in the face of poachers, international smuggling networks and loss of habitat.

The country has seen its tiger population plummet from an estimated 40 000 upon independence in 1947.
