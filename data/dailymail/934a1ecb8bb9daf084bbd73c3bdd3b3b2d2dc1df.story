Disorder: Dozens of police sought to break up the trouble between the opposing groups, at around 1pm today, after the chanting escalated

The angry scenes led to groups kicking and punching each other as police struggled to keep the opposing sides apart.

A total of  58 people - all anti-fascist 
campaigners - were arrested at the scene by police officers and packed onto London buses.

They were then transported to London police stations for further questioning.

At least one man, a BNP activist, suffered a large cut to the nose after fierce shouting from either side of gated barriers spilled into violence.

Police dogs were also deployed to the scene as the protesters fought with each other.

The crowd of anti-fascist protesters 
heavily outnumbered the BNP supporters. They held banners which read 
'smash the BNP' and 'say no to Islamaphobia'.

The fighting came despite calls for peace from police and the family of soldier Lee Rigby in the wake of his death.

The 25-year-old's family yesterday 
stressed that the young soldier would not have wanted violent attacks to
 be carried out in his name, and urged protesters to remain peaceful.

The
 BNP had planned to march from Woolwich Barracks, but were banned from 
doing so by Scotland Yard, amid community fears that their presence 
could prompt disorder.

Around 100 people gathered on Old Palace Yard, clutching BNP banners and calling for 'hate preachers out'.

A short time later, counter protesters began directing chants at them, calling them 'fascist scum', 'you racist Nazis'.

Scotland Yard said that a group, 
believed to be part of the Unite Against Fascism (UAF) protest, gathered
 in a pre-arranged penned area - but some were unwilling to remain 
within that area.

A 
spokesman added: 'Due to police concerns about serious disruption to the
 life of the community, and the potential for serious disorder should 
this counter protest confront the BNP organised protest, police have 
imposed conditions under Section 14 of the Public Order Act.

'Those conditions state that the protest must take place in Whitehall Gardens junction with Whitehall.

'A group of about 300, also believed to be part of the UAF protest, were stopped in Old Palace Yard junction with Abdingdon Street Street.

'This group have now been notified of the conditions imposed under Section 14 and requested to move to Whitehall Gardens to continue their protest. Officers are in negotiation with this group.'

Police sniffer dogs were also deployed at the demonstration to help calm the situation, as tempers flared

The clashes came after BNP supporters and anti-fascist campaigners held opposing demonstrations today

Around
 50 anti-fascist protestors were reported to have rushed towards one man as he was 
escorted by police to the area containing the BNP group.

BNP leader Nick Griffin also attended the protest. He said the murder of soldier Lee Rigby would not be an isolated incident.

He said: 'I believe that by being here today we have at least taken a step to taking the debate to where it needs to be. Not about whether the terrible murder of Lee Rigby was isolated, something which will never happen again. We're pointing out that it will happen again and again and again until the west disengages with Islam and they leave our country.'

In a statement released through the 
Ministry of Defence, members of Drummer Rigby's family including his 
mother Lyn, stepfather Ian, wife Rebecca and son Jack, yesterday said: 
'We would like to emphasise that Lee would not want people to use his 
name as an excuse to carry out attacks against others.

'We would not wish any other families
 to go through this harrowing experience and appeal to everyone to keep 
calm and show their respect in a peaceful manner.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband today 
joined celebrities and thousands of others in signing a letter to a 
newspaper in protest at far-right groups using the death of Drummer 
Rigby for their own agenda.

In
 the letter to the editor of the Daily Mirror, they wrote: 'The EDL and 
Islamic extremists are more similar to each other than to us. They share
 a violent, hate-fuelled desire for conflict and war, and we will not 
let either group tear our country apart.

'We condemn the shameful rise in 
anti-Muslim violence since Drummer Rigby's killing. The fair-minded 
majority of Britons understand that a community cannot be blamed for the
 actions of just two. We know that the EDL does not speak for all 
Britain, just as we know that Muslim extremists do not speak for all 
Muslims.'

The letter was signed by stars including Eddie Izzard, union bosses including TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady, politicians and leaders of Islamic, Jewish and Christian organisations.

Yesterday hundreds of people visited Greenwich Islamic Centre, also known as Woolwich Mosque, after Friday prayers for tea and biscuits in an event aimed at calming tensions.

Representatives of Christian, Muslim, Sikh and Jewish communities also placed flowers arranged to spell the word Peace amongst the thousands of bouquets, cards, poems and candles left in memory of Drummer Rigby near the scene of his killing.

One of Drummer Rigby's suspected killers who was shot by police was released from hospital yesterday and taken into custody.

Michael
 Adebolajo, 28, had already been arrested on suspicion of Drummer 
Rigby's murder, and yesterday was further arrested on suspicion of the 
attempted murder of a police officer.

Michael Adebowale, 22, has already been charged with murdering the young soldier and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Monday.

Two men aged 42 and 46 arrested on suspicion of being involved in the illegal supply of guns were bailed today to return to a south London police station later this month.

Meanwhile officers in Scotland last night said a 25-year-old man had been charged in Inverness in connection with an alleged hate crime on an internet memorial page for Drummer Rigby.

In a statement, police in Scotland said a man was charged 'in connection with an enquiry into alleged hate crime comments on Facebook'.

The man is expected to appear at Inverness Sheriff Court on Monday.

As well as the BNP demonstration in central London today, the English Defence League also held a number of events across the country.

The far-right group dedicated its 'walks of silence'   in memory of Drummer Lee Rigby, who was brutally murdered on the streets of London last month.

Its events took place in dozens of locations, including Leeds, Manchester and Cardiff.

Twitter
 user @Official_EDL retweeted a post which read: 'Everyone at 
#WalkForLee today, no chanting and no racist/nazi actions, leave the 
booze til after, don't hijack our movement and ruin it. (sic)'

The EDL events mostly passed off without incident.

In Edinburgh today, rival protests by the Scottish Defence League (SDL) and anti-racism campaigners took place.

The
 SDL held a static protest outside the Scottish Parliament, while Unite 
Against Fascism (UAF) organised its own counter-protest.

Police,
 who were at the scene in large numbers, kept the two groups apart with 
barriers in the city's Horse Wynd, in front of the Palace of 
Holyroodhouse.

The road was closed to traffic for the duration of the protest, in which both sides held banners aloft and chanted slogans.

The demonstrations appeared to disperse without any clashes between the two groups.
