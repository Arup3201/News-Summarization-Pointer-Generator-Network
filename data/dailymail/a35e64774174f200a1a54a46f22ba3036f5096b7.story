A tattooist has inked his name across his girlfriend's face less than 24 hours after they first met.

Lesya Toumaniantz from Saransk, Russia, allowed Rouslan Toumaniantz to sign 'Ruslan' over her face in giant Gothic script on the day they met

The pair - who'd met on an online chat room - say they quickly fell 'head over heels in love' and soon after met in Moscow, Russia, where they decided to get married.

'It's a symbol of our eternal devotion. I'd like him to tattoo every inch of my body," she said.

Painful procedure: The tattoo covers much of Lesya's face

The tattoo-mad former art student whose sister is also a tattoo artist added that above her eyebrow he had written All For Love.

'All for Ruslan,' she posted on her Facebook today next to a big pink heart.

And now Lesya who has already taken 
Toumaniantz’s name despite only being engaged since January 20 is 
learning to tattoo under his tutorship.

'Their plans for a life together 
include her learning to tattoo while she also gets the full-body ink 
that she’s always dreamed of and of course a family,' said a friend of 
Toumaniantz.

He added: 'I know that there are 
people who are terrified that Lesya has made a rash decision that she’ll
 regret horribly, but sometimes the best decisions are the ones you make
 in an instant with your heart rather than the ones long-debated in your
 mind.

Friends of Lesya have flooded her with messages praising the artwork and how beautiful she looks.

'You must be so happy that you can wear that tattoo. Enjoy it. It looks great,' wrote Ralf Bieler.

'Sooo beautiful. even the style of the name fits your face well,' wrote another.

Mr Toumaniantz's handiwork hit the headlines in 2009 after he tattooed 56 stars across an 18-year-old's face who then lied and accused him of inking her when she was asleep.

Mr Toumaniantz fled Belgium after the scandal caused by Kimberley  Vlaeminckin in 2009.

She lied to her family and reporters and claimed that she had asked Mr Toumaniantz for just three stars near her eye.

As her regret sank in, she claimed he kept adding more and more after she fell asleep at the Tattoo Box in Coutrai, Belgium.

She promised to sue the tattooist for
 the cost of removal, claiming a language barrier meant the Flemish 
speaker had misunderstood when she gave instructions in French and 
English.

Miss Vlaeminck said she avoided going out in public because the tattoos made her feel like a 'freak'.

But a week later she confessed to a 
Dutch TV station that she had been awake throughout and had indeed asked
 for the full 56 marks.

She said she lied because she was afraid of how her father would react.

Even still, Mr Toumaniantz - whose 
own face is covered in tattoos and piercings - offered to pay half the 
cost of laser removal, saying he did not want to leave a customer 
unsatisfied.

He later retracted this offer, leaving Miss Vlaeminck to cover the cost alone.

Though laser treatment has been shown
 to be a effective way of removing ink, even the most advanced 
technology would leave white marks across her face.
