Two Australian women have slipped out of the country to join terrorists in the Middle East as potential jihadi brides, authorities believe.

It is thought that an 18-year-old and her 20-year-old friend made their way to Syria  after they told their parents they were going on a holiday, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The pair from Sydney, believed to be travelling independently to the region, could face the consequences of their actions of up to 10 years in jail if they try to return to Australia.

Two Australian women have slipped out of the country to join terrorists as potential jihadi brides, reports say

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop admits that new reports of young Australians travelling overseas to join the Islamic State is a 'deeply disturbing phenomenon', writes the Sunday Telegraph.

'We are now seeing examples of young women being radicalised and travelling to Syria and Iraq to take part in fighting for listed terrorists organisations,' she said.

It comes just a day after the father of  Australian jihadist Amira Karroum, who was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in  Syria, says he plans to sue the Australian government for his 'angel's' death.

During an explosive interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair program on Friday, Mohamed Karroum says he blames Australian authorities for his daughter's death because they allowed radical Islamic recruiters into the country and they 'allowed her to leave'.

In one shocking comment, an angry Mr Karroum tells journalist Lisa Goddard:

'I'm praying to the Lord every day, Tony Abbott, please Lord, let him lose one of his daughter, either in sickness or in accident or something, please Lord.'

'The Australian government is the mother and father of her, they are the ones who control everything in this country,' Mr Karroum told A Current Affair. 

'I want to take the federal government to court; they are responsible for the death of my daughter.'

Amira, 22, described by her father as a 'beautiful girl' who loved barbecues and dancing with her friends, was in war-torn Syria with her new  husband Tyler Perry, also known as Yusef Ali.

The pair met and married in 2013, before Ali travelled to fight with al-Qaeda in Syria. After the Australian government stopped Amira from trying to leave the country on two occasions, she told family she was going to meet Ali for a vacation in Copenhagen. 

Her body was found shot and dismembered beside her husband's   in a house in Aleppo, just three weeks after she left Australia.

Mohammed Karroum recalled the last message his daughter sent him shortly before her death.

'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' he recalled. 

He says he 'just can't believe' his daughter became an al-Qaeda fighter.

Mohamed Karroum says Yusef Ali, a known extremist, 'poisoned' his daughter's mind

One of the posts from Amira's Facebook page, where she said she worked as a 'Slave of Allah'. 

Mohamed Karroum believes Ali was a trained al-Qaeda killer who was known to Australian authorities.

'I believe she was sacrificed because they were trying to take somebody to court, and they knew she would lead them to him,' he said.  

'The Australian Federal Police and ASIO are not doing their job, this is the fact.'

He is now looking for a lawyer to help him take the federal government to court.

'I want an apology, that's number one, for killing my daughter.'
