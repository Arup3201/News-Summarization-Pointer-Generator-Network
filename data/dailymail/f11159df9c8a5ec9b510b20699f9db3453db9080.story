One of Anderson Cooper's two CNN news shows has been cancelled as the network has now cut AC360 Later.

The show, which featured a rotating panel of guests with Cooper leading a discussion on the day's events, was only introduced in September 2013 but there were signs that it might not last long.

AC360 Later was scheduled to air in the 10pm hour from Monday to Thursday but it was regularly bumped if there was a new documentary that the company licensed or breaking news.

No more unloosening the tie: Anderson Cooper's second hour, called AC360 Later, has been cancelled

Different format: The show was discussion-based and generally ran with a rotating panel of guest hosts

TV Newser reports that it was sometimes replaced by re-runs of Cooper's earlier broadcast, AC360.

The anchor's earlier Emmy Award-winning news show will remain intact at the 8pm primetime slot.

AC360 Later was designed to be a looser more discussion-driven delivery of the news.

CNN personalities like Sunny Hostin, Charles Blow, Mark Geragos and blogger Andrew Sullivan who is a good friend of cooper's.

Cooper, 46, was seen wearing the same outfit as he had worn in his earlier broadcast but loosened his tie on a number of occasions, as if to note that it was a more relaxed setting.

AC360 Later's cancellation was not the only scheduling change announced on Friday, as the network's new 11am hour show is now going to be called '@This Hour' and will be hosted by John Berman and Michaela Pereira from their morning show New Day.

'@This Hour' will bump 'Legal View with Ashleigh Banfield' to noon.

That pushes Wolf Blitzer's show back from 12pm to 1pm and his change prompts an even bigger makeover for his show, which will now be called 'Wolf'.
