A Republican candidate running for office in Minnesota is being sued for sawing his neighbor's garage in half.

Roger Weber, of Nashwauk, Minnesota, claims he used a power saw to hack through through the building as a reaction to a family feud over land - saying the garage encroached onto his property.

He faces a civil trial, and the loss of $40,000, from Mark Besemann, who bought the Nashwauk property in 2013, and shortly found that his garage had been split in two.

Trashed: Mark Besemann, who bought a house, and the garage with it, unwittingly stepped into a family feud over where dividing lines should be drawn on the estate of the late Robert Weber

The dispute over the property stretches back to Weber's father, whose will divided his 40-acre estate into two, according to the Duluth News Tribune.

Weber - who is running for a seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives - says that he hacked the garage in two because it crossed into his portion of the property.

Robert Weber, who died in 2012, used to own the entire estate and all the property - but gave the 39 empty acres to his son in 1978, according to court documents.

This left him with one acre of land, a house and the now-split garage. When he died it passed to his daughter, Ann Anderson, who now lives in Arizona.

She sold the property to Besemann in April 2013 - but Weber thought it was still hers. He had previously threatened to tear down anything on his side of the dividing line - and when Besemann came to inspect his new purchase he found the structure in ruins.

He said: 'It was a pretty rough way to greet your new neighbor... Apparently the property line problem, that the garage might be partially on his acres, wasn’t a problem when his dad lived there. But after I bought it, it became a problem.'

There are also reports the septic system in the house has been tampered with, making the house impossible to rent out. 

Weber has said that Besemann 'knew what he was getting into' when he bought the house - and later batted away questions, saying it is a 'private' matter which has nothing to do with his ambitions for public office.

Besemann filed the initial suit in September 2013. He is seeking $20,000 in damages to the garage and another $20,000 punitive damages.

The case was to be heard this week in Itasca County District Court, but has been delayed until December 15.

Aftermath: The garage is pictured in two piece above shortly after Weber took a power saw to it

Boundaries: Weber has since set up a fence around the disputed land with 'no trespassing' sings on it
