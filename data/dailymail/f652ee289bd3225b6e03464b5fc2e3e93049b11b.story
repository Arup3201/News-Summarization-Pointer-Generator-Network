Couple: Errol Damelin, 43, lives with his wife Julie, 45, and their three children aged four, 12 and 14

The founder of Wonga is splitting from his wife after 15 years of marriage, it has been revealed.

Errol Damelin, 43, who lives with his wife Julie, 45, and their children aged four, 12 and 14, in a six-bedroom house in Hampstead, north-west London, founded the payday lender in 2007.

The couple’s lawyer said last night that their split was ‘with sadness’ but added that they were separating ‘amicably’ and ‘remain fully committed to the welfare and happiness of their children’.

An expensive legal battle is therefore unlikely, which should ensure South Africa-born Mr Damelin can hold onto his £30million stake of the company, which is based in Camden, north-west London, reported The Sun.

A statement from their legal firm Lewis Silkin sent to MailOnline said: 'It is with sadness that Errol and Julie Damelin announce that they are to separate amicably. They remain fully committed to the welfare and happiness of their children.'

Mr Damelin - educated at Boston University in Massachusetts and Cape Town University in South Africa - is a keen skier, cyclist and runner, and founded his first company in Israel.

He set up Wonga with business partner Jonty Hurwitz - and it now employs 500 people, making 3.5million loans last year totalling £1billion, which was a 40 per cent rise on the previous year.

But it has attracted criticism for having a representative APR of 5,853 per cent - although a typical advance of £200 for 14 days would incur fees and interest of around £34.

Wonga has come under strong attack this year from the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who has promised to compete it out of existence by setting up a Church of England credit union.

Controversy: Papiss Cisse of Newcastle United FC eventually agreed to wear the shirt with the club's new sponsor Wonga during a pre-season friendly match against St Mirren in Paisley, Scotland, on July 30

But Dr Welby later admitted that the rival will not be ready to do business for more than ten years - because setting up credit unions to compete with Wonga will take ‘major skills and much time’.

It was a second climbdown after his criticism of the company last month was rapidly followed by the disclosure that the Church’s pension fund had invested money in one of Wonga’s financial backers.

Wonga has also come under attack since it was announced as Newcastle United FC’s main kit sponsor last October, prompting a Senegalese player at the club to refuse to wear the branded shirt.

Muslim striker Papiss Cisse had originally done this on religious grounds, but following talks with the club, his family and Islamic teachers, the £40,000-a-week player said last month he would wear it.
