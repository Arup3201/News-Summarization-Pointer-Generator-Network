Binky will launch her very own book Being Binky next week

Yes it's true; I'm releasing a book.

Being Binky will reveal lots of tales from my childhood, teenage years and life in Chelsea - as well as my favourite beauty tips of course.

I'm so excited for it to come out, and so this week I thought I'd show you all how to achieve my book cover look.

Step One: Prep the Skin

As a Chelsea girl it's very important to me to have perfect blemish free skin so it's a necessary requirement to prep the skin before applying make-up.

Start by cleansing the skin with Bioderma Sensibio H2O, followed by the Clarins BB Skin Perfecting Cream - this is a really nice base just before applying foundation.

Then spritz some Caudalie Beauty Elixir onto the face â€“ this hydrating skin mist is perfect to use just before applying makeup.

Step Two: Smokey-Shimmery Eyes

For this look I've gone for a bronze smoky eye. To stick with the elegant Chelsea look apply Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner with lots of Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara and a set of Eylure eyelashes.

Then take the Clarins Eye Quartet Mineral Palette in Forest, starting with a nice light shimmer base on the lid. After this, create some depth in the eye by using a deep brown and a tiny bit of black in the crease of the lid.

Step Three: Define the Brows

Use the Clarins Pro Palette Eyebrow Kit to define your brows. After applying the powder with an angled brush comb it through so the brows don't look too harsh.

Binky recommends using an angled brush when applying colour to your eyebrows to avoid looking to harsh

Although Binky had a make-up artist at her shoot she says her cover look can easily be achieved at home

Step Four: Sun-Kissed Skin

Take a foundation brush and apply Guerlain Terracotta Skin Healthy Glow Foundation to the face.

The foundation lasts for a long time girls so a little goes a long way for that flawless, natural look.

Step Five: Killer Cheekbones

Use the Daniel Sandler Sculpt and Slim Contour Kit to contour the face and create killer cheekbones.

Follow up by brushing DiorBlush in Miss Pink gently into the apples of the cheeks.

To get a professional look use a brush to apply your lipstick and for a glamorous cover girl look for a big night out try a pair of false eyelashes

Binky says to create depth in the eye area apply a deep brown colour

Step Six: Perfect Pout

Last but not least are the lips. As I always say you never know when a kiss is coming so you're better off being prepared. For the perfect pinky pout swipe a layer of Guerlain Rouge Automatique in Cherry Blossom over the lips.

For a better and more professional result use a brush to apply, moving it vertically along the lines of your lips for a more even finish.

We're all human and we all make mistakes, so after applying your lipstick use a cotton bud to clean up any mistakes. To avoid the embarrassment of having lipstick on your teeth, you can put your index finger in your mouth and drag it out; this will catch up any lipstick that would have made a stain on your teeth.

You can get all the products to create this look on escentual.com. Being Binky is out on Thursday 8th May - can't wait for all of you to read it!Until next time, stay gorgeous.Love Binky xxx
