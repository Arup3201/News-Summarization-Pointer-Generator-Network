A 20-year-old man convicted of shooting a state trooper dead during a routine traffic stop has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Eric Knysz was given the whole life tariff after being found guilty of murdering 43-year-old Paul Butterfield II when the officer pulled over his pickup truck in Mason County, Michigan last September.

During the sentencing yesterday, the 
prosecution accused Knysz of threatening corrections officers by shaping
 his hands like a gun - allegations Knysz denied in court.

As well as first degree murder, Knysz was also found guilty of vehicle theft, carrying a concealed weapon, felony firearm and being an habitual offender.

Speaking at Knysz’s sentencing yesterday, Butterfield’s fiancee Jennifer Sielski said: 'I felt like 
the luckiest woman in the world just to be a part of Paul’s life... He was
 my friend, my inspiration, my hero, my soulmate.'

Mr Butterfield's father also spoke at the sentencing, addressing Knysz directly.

'At the age of 19 years old you have 
effectively ended the life of freedom for yourself... At 19, Paul was a 
high school graduate, a state class A cross-country champion and 
enrolled at the University of Tennessee for track and country. He ran 
marathons world-wide and participated in several triathalons… what have 
you accomplished by the age of 19?' he said.

'I
 do not know if you’re planning on giving a statement to the court but 
if you say how sorry you are for what happened it’ll be for one reason 
and one reason only and as that is you got caught,' Mr Butterfield added.

During sentencing Knysz did apologise to the Butterfield family 'for everything I’ve done and the pain I’ve put them through'.

'I’m sorry, I never meant to take the life of your son. I never meant for any of this to happen,' he added.

In his closing arguments during the trial, defense 
attorney David Glancy noted that the only witness who could place Knysz 
in the pickup that day was his wife, Sarah, who testified against him.

Glancy
 said she benefited from a plea deal with prosecutors that brought her a
 sentence of two to five years in prison as an accessory after the fact.

Sarah Knysz,
 who was in the car at the time of the shooting, had told the court it 
was out of fear for her life and that of her unborn child that she 
protected her husband after the shooting.

'There wasn’t anything that I thought I could have done that day,' she said.

'He
 had a gun and he shot the trooper, and if he did that, what was he 
going to do to a witness that was going to tell on him and was going to 
turn him in? I just wanted to keep me and my baby safe. I was just 
thinking about my baby.'

She added: 'I didn’t mean for any of this to happen, and I didn’t have control over it happening.'

After the shooting, Sarah Knysz 
removed her cell phone battery and erased its memory and helped her 
husband move belongings from the pick up truck to a car he had stolen.

Despite being seen in two stores afterwards she had done nothing to raise the alarm, the court heard.
