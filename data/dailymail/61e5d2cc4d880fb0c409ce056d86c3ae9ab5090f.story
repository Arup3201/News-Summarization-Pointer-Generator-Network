A pregnant Michigan woman  is demanding justice after she walked into a police station to report that she was hit in the face by an officer - and was all but ignored by the supervisor on duty.

Andrea Dingess, who says he is six months pregnant, posted a video on Facebook of the shocking indifference shown by the supervisor at the Lincoln Park, Michigan, Police Department when she demanded to press charges against the officer.

The video has become a massive hit since it went live on May 15 - shared by more than 71,000 people and counting.

At one point, the supervisor sarcastically asks: 'What do you want me to do, go out there and arrest him?'

Ms Dingess responds: 'Yeah! That's what you do to normal people when they assault people.'

Despite repeatedly asking to file a formal complaint, the officer at the desk dismisses her and refuses to take a report.

Ms Dingess says she was assaulted when she was stopped by an officer, who wrote her a ticket for not having ID.

When she pulled out he ID and protested the ticket, she says the officer threw the ticket in her face - and then hit her in the face. 

She claimed she has two witnesses, friends who were in the car. They were the ones who accompanied her to the police station. One of them filmed the encounter.

At one point, Ms Dingess tells the officer: 'You're telling em an officer has a right to assault a pregnant woman?'

The supervisor replies: 'I don't believe he did that.'

She repeats herself: 'He just hit me in the face and I need to file assault charges.'

It's unclear whether Ms Dingess continued to press her case - the video cuts off abruptly.
