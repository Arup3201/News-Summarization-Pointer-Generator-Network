Dannii Minogue has spoken out for the first time about her split from Kris Smith.

The 40-year-old, who announced her relationship with the English sportsman-turned-model last month, has admitted that her showbusiness life has always had an impact on her personal one.

Speaking to AustralianÂ marie claire magazine, Dannii said: 'Fame and work have always had an impact on my family since I went into this business at seven years of age. It's all I know.'

'It's all I know': Dannii Minogue has spoken for the first time since her split from Kris Smith, and admits her fame has always impacted on her personal life

Asked how she is coping with caring for the couple's 22-month-old son Ethan and working as a judge on Australia's Got Talent, Dannii replied, 'how do I juggle everything now?

'Some days with ease, some days with difficulty.

'I have found that, over the years, whatever happens, you have to roll with it.'

The busy star added: 'I try to take it all in my stride, but when it affects my loved ones I feel an internal struggle with the love for my work.'

'I don't want to unsettle him': Dannii says she does not want to tote son Ethan around the world with her for work

The couple have both spoken of their commitment to keeping Ethan's life as unaffected as possible during the break-up, and Minogue also hinted that reports of her re-joining the X Factor judging panel may not be true.

'He has his little routine now,' she said.

'He has swimming lessons; he has things that are important to him.

Tellingly, she added: 'I don't want to unsettle him to follow me around the globe.'

Staying put? The new comments have cast doubt over recent rumours that Dannii is being wooed to return to the X Factor

Recent reports have suggested that Simon Cowell is keen to woo Dannii back to her old job, after not inviting Kelly Rowland to return for a second season.

But her latest comments have cast doubt over these rumours.

Kris, 33, recently appeared on Australian television and insisted that the pair remain 'the best of friends' following their split.

Appearing on breakfast show The Circle, he said: 'It's a struggle, but you know we're the best of friends and we have a massive mutual respect for one another.

'Just taking it one day at a time.'

Getting through it: Kris Smith, last month, said recently that dealing with the split had been a 'struggle'
