The Red Lobster customer accused of writing 'none n*****' on the tip line of his check is so confident he didn't make the slur that he hired a forensics expert to evaluate his handwriting.

The forensics expert evaluated both 20-year-old Devin Barnes' handwriting and that of his wife and concluded: 'There is evidence to indicate that Devin Barnes did not write the total entry. No significant handwriting characteristic similarities were noted.'

Now Mr Barnes and his wife plan on taking legal action against the chain, after receiving numerous death threats when the photo went viral.

Not guilty: Devin Barnes, 20, says he didn't write the n-word on his Red Lobster check and he's got a forensic expert's opinion to back him up

Bad tipper: A forensics expert compared the writing on the total line with a sample of both Mr Barnes and his wife's handwriting and ruled that there were no similarities

'A lot of people on the Internet who I don't know are calling me a racist and I'm thinking people have their own opinion but I know I am not a racist. I don't see color. I have many mixed color friends,' he told WATE.

The photo was posted last month by 19-year-old Red Lobster waitress Christina Jenkins.

'This is what I got as a tip last night...so happy to live in the proud southern states...God Bless America, land of the free and home of the low class racists of Tennessee,' she wrote on her Facebook page.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Miss Jenkins described what happened the afternoon she served Mr Barnes and his wife.

Trouble customers: Speaking last month with MailOnline, Miss Jenkins described Mr and Mrs Barnes as being very rude when she served them

Apology: Mr Barnes wrote a note saying he was sorry for the incident, but admitted that it wasn't him that wrote 'n*****' on the check

'They were extremely rude, but I introduced myself to them and they didn't respond. When I came to take their order they simply told me they wanted their food and to put everything in a to-go box. I offered them dessert but they told me abruptly that they just wanted the check.

'When I went back to the table they had gone and left the receipt and had written in the comments.'

While Mr Barnes admits that he didn't tip Miss Jenkins, he says it wasn't him that wrote the slur.

He explains that the couple asked for their meal to go after getting a call about a family emergency.

Miss Jenkins said she believes him and posted the picture to make a comment about racism, not to draw attention to herself.

'I know I didn't write it. If he's claiming he didn't write it, I believe him wholeheartedly. I'm just that kind of person. I have nothing against him or his family,' Miss Jenkins said.

After hearing that Mr Barnes denied writing the n-word on his check, Miss Jenkins said that she believes him wholeheartedly. She says she posted the check on her Facebook to make a statement about racism, not draw attention to herself

Mr Barnes holds no grudge against Miss Jenkins.

'I'm not mad. I just didn't like what happened. I just wish it didn't come out this way,' Mr Barnes told WSMV.

He does question why the chain didn't investigate the incident more and says he and his wife are looking into legal action.

Mike Bernstein, the spokesman for Red Lobster, said they haven't been contacted by Mr Barnes yet and wouldn't speculate on any possible lawsuit.

'Our employee experience something no one should have to experience and we remain convinced we took the appropriate actions, given the unique circumstances of the situation,' Mr Bernstein said.

In wake of the picture going viral, more than 1,000 people contributed to a fund to raise 10,000 in 'tips' for Miss Jenkins which she says is going towards buying a car, paying for school and helping her church.Â
