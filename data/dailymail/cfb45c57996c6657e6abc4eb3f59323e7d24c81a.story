Bournemouth are interested in taking Tom Lawrence on loan from Leicester City this week.

The Wales U21 international joined Leicester from Manchester United in the summer but has barely figured and Nigel Pearson is willing to let him go out on loan.

Bournemouth want a striker to bolster their attacking options for the promotion run-in and have until Thursday to get someone in on loan.

Lawrence was at Manchester United last season and was replaced by Ryan Giggs on his debut

Lawrence, 21, has made four appearances for Leicester following his surprise summer move but only one start in the FA Cup against Newcastle. He also had a spell on loan at Rotherham earlier in the season.

Several of the Championship's top sides are vying for a striker with Arsenal's Chuba Akpom wanted by Norwich, Derby and Nottingham Forest. Middlesbrough retain an interest also as they look resigned to missing out on Jordan Rhodes with Blackburn refusing to sell.

Derby have also enquired about taking James Wilson on loan from Manchester United but that is unlikely at this stage.
