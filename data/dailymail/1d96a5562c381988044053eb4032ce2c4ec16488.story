Video footage inside the flat which was the site of a ten hour siege on the Gold Coast was filmed by the teenage boy on his phone while he was allegedly being held hostage by his own father.

The 16-year-old hostage appears to have secretly shot the film during a brief moment of 'freedom' when he stepped out onto the balcony of the siege flat. He later posted the video on Facebook.

The footage shows a handwritten note which may be the one the boy dropped to police surrounding the unit during the siege.

Mystery note: In a video secretly filmed the 16-year-old boy while he was his father's hostage in a ten hour siege on the Gold Coast, a handwritten note can be inside the siege house. Police freed the teenager at 8.20pm and he later posted the video which he had surreptitiously shot on his phone  on Facebook

Balcony dash: In the video he shot on his phone, the teenager appears to start filming while inside the flat where his father has him hostage, then he moves out onto the balcony two storeys above the road where heavily armed emergency response police had the Gold Coast unit surrounded for more than ten hours

In the video, the teenager appears to start filming while inside the flat, then moves out onto the balcony two storeys above the road where heavily armed emergency response police have the unit surrounded.

After lingering for a few seconds on the balcony - in what perhaps was the moment the boy dropped a note to police below - he goes back inside the flat where he remained for several hours until police managed to free him at 8.20pm.

Police broke the siege when they accessed the top level of the multi-storey apartment by standing on ladders.

SERT officers then made their way down, holding a bag that had been passed through the window, as the boy exited the building through the ground floor about 15 minutes later.

The pair were assessed by paramedics who were at the scene. Police charged a 42-year-old man with drug offences and assaulting police.

The mother of the man and grandmother of the boy had earlier told the Gold Coast Bulletin the man's mental illness had worsened in recent days.

'He’s become more aggressive, more psychotic, but it’s a case of how do I get him to hospital,' she said.

'It’s up to the patient to take themself to hospital ... unless a terrible incident like this happens and then it may not be resolved in a good way.

'I haven't known whether that would make the situation worse because of course he’s in there terrified,' she said.

Brief moment of freedom: the teenage hostage took the opportunity to break out through the screen door and onto the balcony of the Gold Coast home where he was his father's prisoner for ten hours

Note drop: After lingering for a few seconds on the balcony - in what perhaps was the moment the boy dropped a note to police below - he goes back inside the flat where he remained for several hours until police managed to free him at 8.20pm.

Emergency response police along with police negotiators had surrounded the apartment block  at Currumbin at around 10am after the man took his teenage son hostage.

Earlier, the boy, who raised the alarm himself by calling police at 7am to say he was in danger, dropped a folded note from the balcony of the second storey unit to police on the street below, the Courier Mail reported.

Police have not revealed what the note said. Officers tossed a device into the unit to enable them to speak directly with the armed man.

Neighbours said the drama began brewing on Monday, when they heard shouting coming from the unit.
