Martin Demichelis celebrated making Argentina's World Cup squad by getting his famous ponytail chopped off.

The Manchester City defender made the drastic decision after being recalled by coach Alejandro Sabella for this summer's tournament in Brazil following two years in the wilderness.

Demichelis, who made 35 appearances for City this season as they reclaimed the Premier League title, chopped off his locks to toast the achievement.

He said: 'It was no surprise that he was called for playing in this World Cup, I think he has earned his position.'
