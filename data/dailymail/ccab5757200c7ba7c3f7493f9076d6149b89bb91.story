EU boss Jean-Claude Juncker acted like a ‘business partner’ to Amazon when he was prime minister of Luxembourg, a former company boss claimed

EU boss Jean-Claude Juncker acted like a ‘business partner’ to web giant Amazon when he was prime minister of Luxembourg, a former company boss claimed last night.

Bob Comfort, the firm’s former head of tax, reportedly said the Luxembourg government ‘helped solve problems’ for the business.

In comments reported by the Guardian newspaper, Mr Comfort said: ‘The Luxembourg government presents itself as a business partner and I think it’s an accurate description. It helps to solve problems.’

He said Mr Juncker’s message was: ‘if you encounter problems which you don’t seem to be able to resolve, please come back and tell me. I’ll try to help.’

Amazon’s tax deal with the Duchy is under investigation by the European Commission over the tax arrangements granted to the firm in 2003.

There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the company but the deal reportedly helped it save large sums on tax it would otherwise have paid.

Mr Juncker is under pressure to clarify his part in such dealings.

Yesterday British ministers released details of a new so-called ‘Google tax’ on multinational firms who divert profits out of the country to avoid paying tax.

In a statement quoted by the Guardian, Amazon said it was treated the same as any other company in Luxembourg and did not receive ‘special tax treatment’.

The newspaper also reported that Mr Comfort now had an official role as Luxembourg’s ‘honorary consul for the Seattle region’.

Mr Juncker has come under immense pressure over his role in securing generous tax deals for dozens of major firms, and faced repeated calls to resign.

Last month the scandal erupted over claims that some 340 global companies were granted deals to help them avoid tax during his 18 years in office.

Firms including Pepsi and Ikea are said to have signed ‘sweetheart deals’ with the tiny country to avoid paying billions in tax in other EU countries.

Amazon said it was treated the same as any other company in Luxembourg and did not receive ‘special tax treatment’.

Leaked legal documents appeared to show the arrangements allowed some major companies to enjoy near zero tax rates.

Mr Juncker denied he was the architect of Luxembourg’s tax regime and behind the cosy tax deals agreed with dozens of global companies.

But speeches he made over the two decades he was leader of the tiny duchy showed him taking credit for bringing in major corporations.

The Wall Street Journal, which uncovered the comments, said they showed he was a ‘point man for selling the country’s tax system around the world’.

Mr Juncker admitted he was ‘politically responsible’ for what took place in Luxembourg during his time in charge but has denied direct involvement.

He added: ‘There is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in Europe.’

He also survived a censure vote In the European Parliament. However, Mr Comfort’s claims leave him with further questions to answer.

In May 2003, Mr Juncker told the Luxembourg parliament he had led negotiated deals with internet giants Amazon and AOL to bring them to the grand duchy.

He said at the time: ‘That AOL and Amazon come to Luxembourg, that with and through them we get a new perspective to the future, is the result of a correct tax policy, of a correct infrastructure policy, but also the result of tough negotiations with the top management of the groups.’

‘They took place in America, they took place here at home, and I did not lead them alone.’
