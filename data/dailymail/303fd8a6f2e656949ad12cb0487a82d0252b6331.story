Migrants massing in Calais should be put on a ferry and sent to Britain, the port’s immigration chief said last night.

Warning that the French town was under ‘serious pressure’ as 1,000 Africans gathered at an illegal camp, Philippe Mignonet also called for the border to be moved from Calais to Dover.

He said he wants Britain to share the burden of migration so it ‘understands how difficult the problem is’.

Last night Mr Mignonet said his town 
was struggling to cope and predicted that up to 5,000 people could be 
camped out in Calais by the end of the year.

‘What we want to do is buy the 
migrants ferry tickets to Britain and let them deal with the problem,’ 
he said, adding that more than 30 already make their way across the 
Channel every day.

‘We want the border to be moved from 
Calais to Dover and Folkestone for one month so Britain understands how 
difficult the problem is.’

The comments came as the area’s police
 chief delayed raids on the camp, known as Jungle 2, after tensions 
erupted into clashes between migrant groups the night before.

Jungle 2 and another camp had been ‘due to be dismantled’ after court orders to evacuate expired yesterday.

But following the violence the prefect
 of the Pas-de-Calais area, Denis Robin, said delegations would be sent 
in to speak to the migrants to prevent any further trouble.

The huge influx of migrants from Africa comes after the re-opening of the ports in Libya – a main jumping off point to Europe.

Migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan who have been gathering there for two years can now leave – and an estimated 300,000 are said to be waiting to head across the Mediterranean for a new life.

The change of policy came after Libya said it would help them head to Europe if the EU did not give it financial help to cope with the influx.

From January to April this year, 42,000 migrants were recorded by EU border agency Frontex – 25,650 of them crossing from Libya.

He also announced stricter security 
measures for the port as well as all-night surveillance following the 
clashes between Eritrean and Sudanese migrants.

Meanwhile, it was revealed that the 
mayor of Calais has been writing to French President Francois Hollande 
three times a day and had written to David Cameron – but was yet to 
receive a reply.

Mr Mignonet, who is also the town’s 
deputy mayor, added: ‘People say we are not doing anything, but we can’t
 stop the migrants going from Africa to Italy and making their way to 
England. We are just one town.

‘Europe should help us but they do 
nothing. Our image has suffered and we’re known as a migrant town. 
Businesses have pulled out of investments because they are concerned 
about the migrants.’

He predicted having between 2,000 and 
5,000 migrants in a year’s time if the ‘present disastrous state of 
affairs’ continued in Calais.

He blamed the UK for acting as a 
magnet for migrants wishing to start new lives and called on his 
government to act to save his town from ‘a slow death’.

When asked about Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart’s plans to build a new Sangatte, he said: ‘I dream of that.’

The original Red Cross camp at 
Sangatte, which was home to 2,000 migrants, was shut in 2002 after 
sparking a British immigration crisis.

After the closure, the UK accepted 
hundreds of migrants in a deal with the French government while others 
were forced to move to a makeshift camp which became known as the 
Jungle.

It was razed in 2009 by police, forcing the mostly Afghan and Iraqi Kurd migrants to occupy squats and camps.

The latest wave of migrants, from 
Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan, are said to be increasingly desperate. Mr 
Mignonet said: ‘Now, they realise they have nothing to lose and there’s 
no risk for them any more.’
