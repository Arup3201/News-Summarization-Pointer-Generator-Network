Emergency treatment: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has drafted in a crisis team to deal with problems at South London NHS Trust

A hospital trust that has run up debts of £1million a week today becomes the first to be put into special measures.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley will send in a crisis team of doctors, administrators and accountants to take control of South London Healthcare NHS Trust.

It has gone £150million into the red over the past three years, largely because of crippling Private Finance Initiative deals agreed by the last Labour government.

Its three hospitals will cost £2.5billion under the long-term construction and management scheme.

The financial chaos has already hit patient care at the hospitals – Queen Mary’s in Sidcup, Queen Elizabeth in Woolwich and the Princess Royal University Hospital in Bromley.

While services have improved in recent months, patients still face some of the longest waits for operations in the country.

One in six patients waited longer than the 18-week Government target – the worst figure for any NHS trust in London.

It also performs poorly on casualty unit waiting times, ranking 20th out of 23 trusts in the capital. Some departments and wards face closure.

The Trust took on a large debt when it was formed - mainly from the PFI that had been used for building at the Princess Royal and Queen Elizabeth hospitals.

Mr Lansley has activated an ‘unsustainable providers regime’, putting the trust under the control of a special administrator with powers to demand rapid changes.

The Health Secretary stepped in after draft financial plans showed the trust would have a deficit of £30-£75million a year for the next five years.

In his letter to the trust, he wrote: ‘South London Healthcare NHS Trust faces deep and longstanding challenges, some of which are not of its own making.

'Nonetheless, there must be a point when these problems, however they have arisen, are tackled

'I appreciate that any decision to use these powers will be unsettling for staff, but I want to stress that the powers are being considered now so that patients in South East London have hospital services that have a sustainable future.  This will benefit patients and bring more certainty to staff, the public and other local stakeholders.

'I am determined to improve healthcare services for patients in South East London and will take whatever difficult steps are necessary to achieve this.'

A Department of Health source said Mr Lansley was not prepared to run the risk of a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal in which poor quality care and mismanagement led to the needless deaths of hundreds of patients.

Stephen Powell, chairman of the Health Select Committee, told Radio 4's Today programme that there was clearly a need for change in the face of such enormous losses.

He said there was an 'over-dependence on hospitals' and that one focus of the restructuring may be improving 'care in the community'.

The move means that, unlike loss-making companies in the private sector, the Trust will not have to pay back the money it has lost.

Mr Powell added: 'Politicians are responsible but the Secretary of State can't make all the decisions. There is a need for change.'

An administrator could now be brought in and the Trust could go bust, leading to it being dissolved and some services closed.

The Department of Health said in a statement: 'The hospitals in this Trust have faced multiple problems for many years, which the previous Labour Government made worse by a merger, and the approval of two huge PFI deals that have further destabilised the Trust. The trust lost over £1 million a week last year, enough to pay for 1000 cataract operations per week, 200 hip replacements per week, or pay the salaries of 1200 nurses.

'The unsustainable providers regime was created by Labour’s Andy Burnham when he was Health Secretary. However, Labour never made use of them, preferring instead to sweep the  problems facing some parts of the NHS under the carpet.

'South London Healthcare NHS Trust is an exceptional case, showing most of the problems which are characteristic of “challenged” NHS Trusts. There are about two dozen sucg Trusts where the Government inherited serious longstanding problems.

'Andrew Lansley’s decision will send a strong signal to unsustainable NHS organisations that they cannot continue to provide poor services or rely on bailouts from other parts of the NHS.

'All the hospitals deemed to be unsustainable have signed agreements with the Department of Health to turn their performance around, and it is possible that the Government will consider putting some of them or others who cannot deliver sustainable services into special measures if their leadership does not make progress fast enough.

'South London Healthcare NHS Trust has 
previously owned up to multiple challenges including not being efficient
enough, delivering low quality services, having poor contracting 
arrangements and having a weak board. Like the many other hospitals yet 
to become part of the elite NHS Foundation Trusts, the Trust faces 
problems which – according to the National Audit Office - "have lain 
unresolved for a number of years".'

Chris Ham, chief executive of health 
think tank the Kings Fund, warned on Radio 4's Today programme 
that not only other
NHS Trusts, but potentially even Foundation Trusts at the very top, could go 
through the same thing.

He
said it was important to face up to the problems, and that administrators would be able to restructure.
