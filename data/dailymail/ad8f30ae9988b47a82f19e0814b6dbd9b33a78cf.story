The manipulation of key interest rates by Barclays is just 'the tip of the iceberg', the City's regulator warned yesterday.

Barclays was fined a record £290million and its three most senior managers have been forced to resign over its involvement in the rigging of Libor, the inter-bank lending rate.

Speaking before MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said other banks may find themselves implicated in the financial scandal.

He added: 'We don't know, but I would be amazed if this was everything.'

His colleague, Tracey McDermott, acting director of financial crime at the FSA, confirmed it is investigating seven other banks.

In a further twist, Jerry del Missier, the former chief operating officer at Barclays, told MPs he was clearly told by Bob Diamond, his former boss at the bank, to cut Libor during a telephone conversation on October 29, 2008.

He said: 'I took the action on the basis of the phone call that I had had with Mr Diamond.' Mr Diamond strenuously denies he gave such an instruction.

Mr del Missier, who is rumoured to have been paid £6.5million last year, said: 'He [Bob Diamond] said that he had a conversation with Paul Tucker of the Bank of England, that the Bank of England was getting pressure from Whitehall around Barclays, the health of Barclays as a result of Libor rates and that we should get our Libor rates down.'

Andrew Bailey, head of the regulator's prudential business unit, said of Barclays: 'There was a problem with this institution and that problem came from the top'.

Asked whether he meant Mr Diamond, he said: 'Yes.'

It also emerged yesterday that Barclays staff told Stephen Morse, the head of compliance at the bank, about the controversial instruction to lower Libor.

Last night, Barclays refused to reveal whether or not Mr Morse still works for the bank, although he is currently listed as 'inactive' on the City regulator's list of authorised people.
