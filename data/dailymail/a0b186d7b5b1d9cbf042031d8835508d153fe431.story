Predator: Shane Webber was jailed for preying on two girls just days after his release from prison for a harassment campaign against his ex-girlfriend

An internet stalker jailed for harassing his girlfriend was behind bars again yesterday after preying on two schoolgirls within days of his release.

Shane Webber had subjected his childhood sweetheart Ruth Jeffery to a humiliating three-year trolling campaign, using social networking sites to send naked pictures  of her to her friends and family, including her horrified parents.

The twisted 23-year-old consoled his girlfriend in person while torturing her online, which included assuming her identity on adult websites and inviting men to knock on her front door and ask for sex.

He was jailed for four months last November when his ‘vile and malicious’ hate campaign was eventually exposed.

But within days of his release in January, Webber committed a series of online sexual offences against two 15-year-old girls.

Miss Jeffery, who became suicidal during her ordeal, was in court yesterday to hear how her former boyfriend tried to entice the girls to strip and perform sexual acts for him, and sent one of them a video of him and Miss Jeffery having sex.

After he persuaded one of the girls to run away to meet him, Webber was arrested, although he claimed they had not been intimate.

Nottingham Crown Court heard how Webber contacted the girls using MSN Messenger in January, only eight days after being released from prison, and performed depraved acts while they watched.

Yesterday, unemployed Webber, from Nottingham, admitted causing or inciting a female under 16 to engage in sexual activity, one count of making indecent photos and two counts of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child.

After Webber was jailed for three 
years, Miss Jeffery, 23, said she was ‘revolted’ to hear he still had a 
video of her. She added: ‘He was asked to get rid of all images of me. I
 was revolted when I discovered he hadn’t. I felt physically sick.’

'Manipulation and deceit': Jailing Webber at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Michael Stokes, QC, told him that the courts have a duty to protect vulnerable youngsters from exploitation

Sickened: Ruth Jeffery, Webber's ex-girlfriend, leaves court after his sentencing. She was driven to the brink of suicide after he posted sexually explicit pictures of her online and impersonated her on dating websites

Sentencing Webber, Judge Michael Stokes QC said he had used ‘a high degree of manipulation and deceit’.

Miss Jeffery met Webber when they 
were 11 at school together in Nottingham. He began his campaign of abuse
 by setting up fake email addresses to pose as former school friends, 
which he used to send sexually explicit photos and videos to Miss 
Jeffery.

He then began distributing photos of 
her – some of which were taken after bursting in on her while she was in
 the shower – on adult websites and to family and friends using social 
networking websites.

Betrayal: After his original conviction, Webber was supposed to have deleted all the sexual photos of Miss Jeffery he had in his possession, but he kept some on an external hard drive

'I don't forgive him': Miss Jeffery said she had attended court to see Webber's trial because she wanted to her for herself just what he had done just days after his release for harassing her

Outside court, Miss Jeffery said: ‘I 
could not believe that he had offended again. I was shaking. The fact it
 happened almost as soon as he came out of prison made it even worse.

‘It was not nice seeing him again and I did not think I would ever have to. But I wanted to hear for myself what had happened.’

Miss Jeffery, a student, said that 
she was pleased with the sentence. ‘I don’t feel anything towards him, 
but I don’t forgive him,’ she added.

The grandfather of one of  Webber’s 
latest victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said:  ‘He is 
proof that a leopard cannot change its spots.

‘When he comes out of prison for 
these offences, I would not expect anything different. He is very 
devious and has blown our family apart.’

Sweethearts: Webber and Miss Jeffery met when 
they were just 11 and at school together in Nottingham. Their relationship turned sour after she became 
pregnant by him and decided to have an abortion
