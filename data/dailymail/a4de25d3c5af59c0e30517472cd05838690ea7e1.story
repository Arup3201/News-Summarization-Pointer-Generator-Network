A mother battling leukaemia has seen her three brothers - her last chance of a life-saving bone marrow transplant - barred from Britain.

Fatemeh Mehdipour, 42, has undergone three aggressive courses of chemotherapy since she was diagnosed with the the disease in June.

Her siblings Nader, Naser and Esmaeil are the closest surgical matches to the patient but they have all been refused visas to fly to Britain from Iran.

Mrs Mehidipour's third brother Naser was also denied permission to travel to the UK for testing 

The Home Office said it was 'not satisfied' they would be 'genuine visitors' and feared they would seek to stay in Britain after their visas expired.

The mother-of-two said: 'I am just waiting for this transplant. I need this transplant.

'I could not believe it. I just hope the Embassy can get them the visas.

'When I think about my situation, how can I relax and concentrate on my chemotherapy? It is not easy.'

Mrs Mehdipour's devastated daughter Azar, 24, said: 'We were all so positive, and thought mum would be having her transplant.

'Everyone is so angry - she will die if she doesn't get this transplant.

'She needs it within four weeks.

'The chance of us finding an unrelated donor is almost zero - there is a real shortage of Middle-Eastern donors.

'I can't describe what we have been going through.

'When my mother asks me if she is going to die, it kills me inside and out.'

Medics in Birmingham wrote a letter supporting the visa application to allow for a possible transplant operation

The Home Office wrote to Mrs Mehdipour's brother in Iran confirming that they will not be issued a visa 

Mrs Mehdipour, who lives in Solihull, West Midlands moved to the Britain 12 years ago. Her husband Habib, 51, and a wholesale retailer, said: 'It is so hard for somebody to undergo chemotherapy anyway but I do not personally think she can bare with it. It is so hard for us.'

Her brothers applied to visit the UK for 15 days at the British Embassy in Turkey.

But their applications were rejected despite doctors at Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, where she is receiving treatment, vouching for them.

Consultant haemotologist Dr Bhuvan Kishore wrote to the embassy saying: 'In order to cure her leukaemia she is in need of a bone marrow transplant; without it she may die.

'It is imperative you allow her siblings to travel to the UK to have further testing to establish which one is likely to be the best donor for her.

'Fatemeh has an aggressive form of acute myeloid leukaemia which is incurable without a transplant.

'She is lucky enough to have three siblings who are a match.

'But they need to donate stem cells as soon as possible so she can proceed with a potentially curable treatment.'

Yet, astonishingly, an immigration officer told the brothers in a letter: 'I am not satisfied you are a genuine visitor to the United Kingdom or that you intend to leave the United Kingdom on completion of your proposed visit.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits, including any compelling and compassionate circumstances, and in line with immigration rules.

'The onus is on the individual to ensure they provide all the necessary evidence when submitting an application.'
