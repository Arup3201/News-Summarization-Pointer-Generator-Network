Ello is an invitation-only and recent reports suggest requests to join it have increased from 4,000 to 30,000 in just one week

Facebook has been criticised for suspending the accounts of drag artists and other performers who don't want to use their real names on their profiles.

And now users fed up with this policy are flocking to a social networking site, dubbed ‘Hello Ello’, which allows anyone to sign using a fake name.

The site is invitation-only and recent reports suggest requests to join have increased from 4,000 to 30,000 in just one week.

Ello looks like a cross between Twitter and Tumblr, using the @handles more commonly associated with former.

It was created by California-based designer Paul Bundnitz who came up with the design after feeling ‘fed up with other social networks.'

To sign up, users are instructed to enter their email address, or an existing user has to invite them.

The criteria for being accepted are unclear.

The site itself has a black-and-white colour scheme and a clean, scroll-down layout that lets users post status updates, upload pictures and comment on each other’s posts.

Those 
invited into the network are only allowed to invite five to 10 new 
people and the website's homepage states they will keep user data and 
privacy safe.

‘Your
 social network is owned by advertisers,’ the site reads.

‘Every post 
you share, every friend you make and every link you follow is tracked, 
recorded and converted into data.

‘Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product that’s bought and sold.’

Unusually for a social network, the site is ad-free in the hope of enticing users away from Twitter and Facebook.

However, Jason Duaine at Complex points out that sites such as Diaspora and App.net built themselves around an add-free model, without much success.

But Ello intends to make its money by offering users themes and services that can make the social networking site better.

their disappointment last month after Facebook executives met with them 
and refused to change the policy banning stage names

Earlier this month, drag queens threatened to boycott Facebook for refusing to let them use stage names on the site.

The world's largest social media network has been blocking hundreds of profiles that do not comply with the policy requiring users to operate under their legal names.

But a group of transvestites in San Francisco claim it is their human right to identify as their alter-egos.

The social media giant claims the policy 'helps create a safer and more accountable environment'.

Jinkx Monsoon, star of RuPaul's Drag Race, condemned the policy as a distraction from other more important issues in the community, who told MailOnline: 'Can Facebook just get this figured out quickly please? Aliases have existed for ages, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.' 

While the increase in user requests is yet to be explained, many are claiming it is due to Facebook’s naming policy, which requires all users to go by their legal name.

The policy was criticised, earlier this month, as several drag performers and activists said they had been locked out of their accounts for breaching the policy.

After San Francisco city officials got involved, Facebook agreed to temporarily give individuals affected by the policy back their accounts, the social network has so far not changed their rules.
