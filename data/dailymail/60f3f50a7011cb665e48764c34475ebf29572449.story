It is the popular shooter video game that has sold hundreds of millions of copies, but Call Of Duty -  which launched back in 2003 - has only just added female characters.

The latest version of the much-loved game, Call Of Duty Ghosts, will include female characters - something the creators say wasn't technically possible before.

Infinity Ward, the studio who created the game, due out in November, is finally allowing players to customise the sex of their characters.

Violent: The Call Of Duty video gaming series is extremely popular in the gaming world and involves a lot of shooting, killing and violence

Speaking to Kotaku.com, Ghosts executive producer Mark Rubin, said: 'We really want players to feel more connected and engaged with who they are as a player.

'We felt that that was something that casual players, who are a huge portion of our fan base, would benefit the most from.

'Our fan base is huge. We cover such a dramatic range of people who play our game that we wanted to be as inclusive as we possibly could with character customisation. And that's where the idea came from. Why wouldn't we have a female [option] then?'

Other popular multi-player games similar in style to Call Of Duty, such as Halo and Gears of War, added female character options to their games many years ago.

When questioned, Rubin blamed the absence of women on technological issues.

The people behind the game say they've added female character options in an effort to be more inclusive

'Our previous engine would not handle that. The way memory worked in the previous engine, it never would have been able to do that.'

When Rubin says 'that' he means the engine's ability to power a multi-player map made up of characters with custom appearances, including being a female.

Players will now have over 20,000 possible combinations for their characters, including heads, body types, equipment, and gender

The Twittersphere seems pleased by the news.

One male user wrote: 'Call of duty have done a good thing by introducing female characters it will help against sexism loads.'

Another gamer said: 'No one understand how happy it makes me Call of Duty is finally featuring female characters. Maybe they read all my complaints.'

Yet another player added: 'Female characters in CALL OF DUTY. Who would've thought. It's almost like we play the game or something.'

And one cheeky Twitter user wrote: 'Fact: Female characters were just revealed for Call Of Duty: Ghosts. Which means the dog was revealed before they were (don't hurt me).'

Female fans were happy, but some tweeters added sexist comments
