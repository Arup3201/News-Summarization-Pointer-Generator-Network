A new dating site is embracing genetic science to match young professionals together, by testing the DNA of their customers to find certain indicators that make a good match.

The site, SingldOut.com, works by mailing out DNA testing kits to their customers, who then spit in a tube and send it back. The tube is then sent to a lab, where it is tested for the presence of two genetic markers.

The two markers tested for are the serotonin uptake controller, which is involved in how people handle positive and negative emotions. The second marker tested for relates to the genes influencing the person's immune system.

Within one week, the test results appear on the user's profile, where they can be compared with the results of other users.

According to research by Instant Chemistry, the maker of the testing kits used by SingldOut, there is a strong correlation between people in long-term relationships having different versions of the serotonin genes and different immune systems.

The tests referenced on the website include an experiment at a Swiss University where males were asked to wear the same t-shirt for two consecutive nights. Women who had never met any of the men then smelled each t-shirt, rating the odors from most pleasant to least pleasant.

The study revealed that the women rated the most pleasant odors (pheromones) as coming from the shirts worn by the men with the Human Leukocyte Antigen gene sequence the most opposite to their own.

'With online dating, you have socioeconomic factors people try to match on — religion, how much you make,' Ron Gonzalez, co-founder of Instant Chemistry, told USA Today. 'This is another layer on top of that so you can better find matches.'

SingldOut allows people to sign up using their LinkedIn account. According to the website, user's information will never be shared with LinkedIn. 

Membership prices for SingldOut are $199 for three months, $249 for six months or $299 for 12 months. Members also take a psychological assessment. However, on the SingldOut Twitter account, promotional codes for $53 per month membership (three months being the minimum, making the actual price $159) are being tweeted daily.

According to scientists, there are a host of environmental factors that come into play when it comes to selecting a mate, and that the markers tested by Instant Chemistry may only account for a minute portion of what causes attraction on a genetic level.

According to one scientist who spoke to USA Today, SingldOut is only 'looking at a very small number of genes, and you simply cannot extrapolate a prediction from those genes to long-term compatibility.' 

According to one of the testimonials posted on the site, a couple named Jon & Danielle said that 'Using the DNA sample kit was easy and fun. We knew we had a strong relationship going into the test, and getting the very positive results back just reinforced that.'
