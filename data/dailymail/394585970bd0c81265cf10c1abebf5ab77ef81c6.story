A grandmother says she was left 'looking like a monster' after a reaction to a lip gloss caused her lips to blister and break out in pus-filled sores. 

Doctors thought Lynda Roberts, 62, from Salford, had developed a viral condition after huge cold sore-like lesions covered her lips.

Her lips began to tingle then blister - and later burst and crack.

Mrs Roberts says she felt 'ugly and dirty' and missed her 40th wedding anniversary because she couldn't face leaving the house.

Doctors thought Mrs Roberts had a virus causing her lips to crack, and she tried different medications to treat her painful lips (pictured left and right). She said she felt 'ugly and dirty' and missed her 40th wedding anniversary as she couldn't face leaving the house

The grandmother-of-four, who works in a doctor's surgery, never suspected her Dior Addict lip gloss was to blame, having used the product before.

After trying a plethora of different medicines, Mrs Roberts decided to stop using her 'Dolly Pink' lip gloss in case it made it worse – and was amazed when her 'viral condition' disappeared.

But after months of agony it emerged the French cosmetics firm had changed the formula – adding a preservative called propyl gallate in the new tube Mrs Roberts' daughter had bought for her.

Dior then arranged for her to have tests with a dermatologist which revealed the allergy to propyl gallate, a preservative used to stop cosmetics reacting with oxygen and fats in food.

The company has since sent her a letter apologising for the 'inconvenience' and a free candle – and at Mrs Roberts' request donated her refund to charity.

Mrs Roberts, a mother-of-two, said: 'It's a bit more than an inconvenience – and a candle just doesn't cut it.

'I missed my 40th wedding anniversary because I looked like a monster and just didn't want to go out.

'It made me look ugly and dirty, especially when it went into black scabs.

'I think other people should know about propyl gallate because it can cause such a severe reaction.'

Propyl Gallate is a preservative used in a wide range of cosmetics and beauty care products, including lipsticks, bath products, skin cleansing products, moisturisers, skin care products, makeup, self-tanning products, and sun cream.

It is also used in foods like meat products, microwaveable popcorn, soup, chewing gum, mayonnaise and frozen meals.

It has antioxidant properties, which means it helps stop oxygen molecules from mixing with the oil in food, causing the food to go rancid.

In cosmetic products, it stops the oxygen mixing with the oil, which could change the colour and texture of the product, or cause the active ingredients in the formula to deteriorate.

Christian Dior said in a statement: 'Consumer safety is our main priority. All cosmetic products placed on the European market are regulated by strict EU laws (the Cosmetic Products Regulations EC No 1223/2009).

'Propyl gallate is not on the prohibited list nor is its use restricted in cosmetics.

'It is not carcinogenic. It is a food additive (E310).

'We were sorry to learn of our consumer's condition and were grateful that she had taken the time to return the product for analysis.

'Cases like these are fed into the industry scientific bodies to continue to inform research and regulation of this industry.' 

Dr Christopher Flower,  director general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), the industry body that represent cosmetics firms, said: 'Unfortunately, even with such comprehensive safeguards, it is not possible to avoid all possibility that someone somewhere might react to one of the ingredients. 

'Such reactions are rare but nevertheless of concern and distressing for those affected. 

'This does not mean the product is unsafe but it does mean that anyone who has reacted to a product and knows which ingredient caused that reaction must avoid the same ingredient in any other cosmetic product as well. 

'This can be checked by consulting the ingredient list that must be available either on the label or, for small products, at the point of sale.' 

Mrs Roberts had used Dior Addict lip gloss for years, but the company recently added propyl gallate - a preservative used in cosmetics - to the formula, which triggered an allergic reaction

The news comes after MailOnline reported the case of Karen Mooney, 52, who was left with red sores all over her face after using expensive beauty products from Clarins.

Ms Mooney's skin began breaking out in welts after regularly using Clarins products, such as the Lait Demaquillant Cleansing Milk and Extra-Firming Day Cream.

The dating agency boss from Surrey had been using Clarins products for cleansing and moisturising for two decades.

It was discovered she had an allergy to methylisothiazolinone (MI), a preservative in the Clarins creams. 

The preservative was first approved for use in skincare in 2005. 

Two studies presented at the British Association of Dermatologists’ conference in 2013 showed a sharp rise in reactions to MI over the past three years.
