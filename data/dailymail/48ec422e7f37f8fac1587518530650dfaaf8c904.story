One-on-one lessons, no noisy distractions and the teacher's undivided attention.

It may sound like the sort of education many parents could only dream of for their children.

But this is the reality for one little seven-year-old girl in China who is the only pupil in her entire school.

Zhang Siqi is one of a few students living in rural China who have ended up being taught completely alone in school after their thriving villages turned into ghost towns.

Lonely: Zhang Siqi, aged eight, sits alone in a classroom at the school in Nanou, south-east Fujian Province

One-on-one tuition: Siqi is taught by sole remaining teacher at the school, Zhang Wanjia

It comes as more and more villagers are abandoning their countryside homes in a desperate attempt to try and find work in the cities.

Siqi's school - located in Nanou in the south-eastern Fujian Province - is just one of many to have been left with no children to teach following the mass exodus.

Once it would have held taught dozens of pupils living in the small but thriving community.

But as villagers deserted the area, the school was eventually forced to close in 2009 and 2010 because there were no registered students.

It only reopened last year when Siqi, then seven-years-old, was admitted.

Lively pupil: Despite being the only child in the entire school, Siqi doesn't appear to mind too much

Count down: But four new pupils will be attending the school with Siqi next year

Siqi was born with a missing spinal disc
and needs extensive family care. Because of this it was decided that 
the local school was her best choice as it's very close to her home.

Now she attends the school every day to be taught by the sole remaining teacher Zhang Wanjia.

He follows the national curriculum - even playing basketball and jogging with Siqi during PE classes.

Once a week they hold a national flag raising day with Siqi standing alone in the schoolyard to sing the national anthem.

Singled out: Siqi is one of many pupils who have ended up being the only pupil in rural schools after villagers have left their homes to find work in cities

Nap time: The school was closed in 2009 and 2010 because there were no registered students until Siqi joined last year

Warming up: Siqi is taught the national curriculum - so her teacher Zhang Wanjia also teaches her PE

But Zhang, who has been teaching for 35 
years, said that while the one-student teaching looks easy, it is 
actually is very tiring and lonely.

Two player game: Zhang Wanjia challenges Siqi to a game of basketball

He said: 'When I am alone in the office, I don't even have a person to chat with.'

Siqi's mother is a migrant worker in Zhangzhou city while her father and grandmother work in a local tea garden.

'She
is very considerate,' said Siqi's 76-year-old grandma. 'She often stops
me from going out to work, saying I am too old and it's dangerous for 
me to work outside.'

But, in a sign that migration to the cities may be reversing, Siqi can take heart that next year she will have some classmates as four new children will be starting at the school.

But she is not alone in being the only pupil to an entire school.

Last week, the Mail covered the story
of eight-year-old Hu Yang who is the only pupil to attend his 
elementary school in, Fujian Province, China.

His
three-storey school building was built in 2005 and boasts 24 classrooms
- all of which are empty apart from the one where Yang receives his 
lessons.

Two years ago 
the school had 80 students which dropped to 17 last year.

But now there 
is just Yang, who sits alone at a solo desk in the middle of an empty 
room with a concrete floor.

His
teacher Zheng Zhixiong said: 'Although we have only one student, we 
teach him strictly with the plan made by the education bureau.

'He is a 
good student and as teachers we also feel less pressure'

Torn apart: Siqi lives with her father and 76-year-old grandmother in the village. Her mother has moved to a city for work

Home time: Siqi waves goodbye to her teacher Zhang Wanjia and a security guard

Running all the way home: Siqi manages to keep herself entertained despite having no children her own age to play with

He added: 'We try our best to let him feel the same as in other schools. As some day he may leave and join in another school.'

Mr Zheng explained that the students had either quit school or had gone with their parents to the cities look for work.

One of the last pupils to leave was Yang's 13-year-old sister.

Fujian Province is a mountainous province in the south-east of China. It has a population of around 35million.

Many people are forced to move away from the area where they were born to look for work in cities.

Single student: Hu Yang is the only pupil at his school in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, where two teachers attend to his every need

Industrious: The eight-year-old was once one of 80 pupils at the institution but all the others have left

Wide world: Many of Yang's fellow students have moved away when their parents went to look for work

Hopeful: His teachers say that Yang may eventually go to a normal school where there are other students
