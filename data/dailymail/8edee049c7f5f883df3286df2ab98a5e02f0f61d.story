The widow of a cop who was shot dead while on duty today hit out at a college's decision to let his killer perform a graduation speech, branding it 'despicable'.

Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is serving life in prison for gunning down officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981, has been selected as a speaker at his alma mater: Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont.

The liberal arts college, which has around 600 students, plans to play the 60-year-old convict's recorded remarks alongside a video about him at a commencement on Sunday.

But today, Mr Faulkner's wife, Maureen, said the students' selection of graduation speaker was 'inappropriate' and should be reversed.

She told Fox News: 'It’s not appropriate. His freedom was taken away when he murdered a police officer in the line of duty.'

'It seems like our justice system allows murderers to continue to have a voice over the public airwaves and at college commencement. It’s despicable.' 

Abu-Jamal, born Wesley Cook, was originally sentenced to death after killing 25-year-old Mr Faulkner, from Philadelphia, during an early morning traffic stop on December 9, 1981.

Victim: Abu-Jamal was originally sentenced to death after killing 25-year-old Mr Faulkner (above). But his sentence was later reduced to life without parole

However, his sentence was later reduced to life in prison without parole. In 1996, he received a bachelor of arts degree from Goddard College through a correspondence program. 

The commencement on Sunday will be the third one at which Abu-Jamal has spoken, with the killer having previously appeared at Washington's Evergreen State College and Ohio's Antioch College.

'How can this go in our country?' said Mrs Faulkner. 'People need to start realizing that there’s right and wrong in this world. It seems like no one thinks about that.'

Despite Mrs Faulkner's comments, Goodard College's interim president Bob Kenny has defended Abu-Jamal's upcoming appearance at the school.

On the college's website, he said the decision reflects students' 'freedom to engage and think radically and critically in a world that often sets up barriers to do just that.'

However, the Vermont Troopers' Association said in a statement that including Abu-Jamal in the ceremony shows 'an absolute disregard' for Faulkner's family.

'While our nation is searching for solutions to gun violence in our schools and communities, we are outraged that Goddard College is hosting a man who shot and killed a police officer,' it said.

Pennsylvania Corrections Secretary John Wetzel added that he is 'disdainful' of the college's decision to choose Abu-Jamal, who is housed at the Mahanoy state prison in Frackville.

'Police officers put their lives on the line every day to protect society and now we have a college allowing an individual convicted of murdering a police officer to share his opinions with impressionable students. This fact is very troubling,' he said.

He continued: 'Inmates do have a constitutional right to access telephones. While we do not support or endorse this specific type of activity, we cannot prohibit it from happening.'

Goddard College holds 20 commencement ceremonies every year, so students in each degree program can individualize their graduations and choose their speaker.

Undergraduates design their own curriculums with faculty advisers and do not take tests or receive grades, said college spokesman Dustin Byerly.

The students who chose Abu-Jamal as a speaker are receiving bachelor of arts or fine arts degrees.

Widow: An emotional Mrs Faulkner said. 'People need to start realizing there’s right and wrong in this world'

Twenty of the 23 students are expected to attend the ceremony. 

Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panther Party, claims he has been victimized by a racist justice system in the wake of the killing.

He has since attracted international support, with books, documentaries and radio shows helping publicize his case.
