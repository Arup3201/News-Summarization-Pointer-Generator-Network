If using your age, gender and marital status wasn't enough for companies to show you highly targeted ads, Apple has filed plans to use your emotions, too.

The patent, filed by the firm earlier this month, proposes a system that uses 'mood-associated characteristics' to determine how a user is feeling and show the most appropriate adverts.

This includes analysing which apps they’re using, websites they've visited, whether it's a national holiday or not, as well as heart rate and facial expressions.

An Apple patent has proposed a system that uses 'mood-associated characteristics' to determine whether a user is happy, pictured, sad, angry and so. They can then show the most appropriate adverts. This includes analysing which apps they're using, websites they've visited, heart rate and facial expressions

If a user, for example, has been 
playing game apps and watching funny videos on YouTube, Apple could 
infer that they are happy, or in a positive frame of mind.

The
 adverts shown could not only be personalised, based on the type of 
video or game, they could also be light-hearted and have a 'positive 
tone.'

Similarly, the system could take into account external factors to determine the mood.

On
 national holidays, or the user's birthday, the inferred mood of the 
adverts could be lifted, while following a tragedy, or if the user has 
been planning a funeral, for example, the mood could be 'downgraded.'

It could also be downgraded if the user listens to love songs, ballads or emo music, as an example.

Apple could even record how much pressure is applied to a device's screen, in a bid to gauge anger or stress levels.

The patent is called 'Inferring user mood based on user and group characteristic
data'. 

Apple's system would work on the current principle used in personalised and targeted advertising on websites.

Currently, if users allow cookies to track them around the web, companies can show related adverts on other webpages, because they know what kind of products the user is interested in.

For example, if a user is searching for a holiday, the adverts will promote holidays, flights and other related travel products or services.

Yet Apple's system would take this a step further, by using a person's mood to personalise the adverts.

If a user, for example, has been playing game apps and watching funny videos on YouTube, Apple could infer that they are happy, or in a positive frame of mind.

The adverts shown could not only be personalised, based on the type of video or game, they could also be light-hearted and have a 'positive tone.'

Similarly, the system could take into account external factors that may determine the mood.

On national holidays, or the user's birthday, the inferred mood of the adverts could be lifted, while following a tragedy, or if the user has been planning a funeral, for example, the mood could be 'downgraded.'

The patent also states other physical characteristics could be used to establish a person's mood, such as blood pressure, perspiration rate, body temperature and movement. This suggests the technology could be used in any wearable technology the firm releases, including its rumoured iWatch, concept pictured

It could also be downgraded if the user listens to love songs, ballads or emo music, as an example.

Elsewhere, the patent states physical characteristics could be used to establish a person's mood, such as 'heart rate; blood pressure; adrenaline 
level; perspiration rate; body temperature; vocal expression, movement characteristics and 
facial expressions.'

This means the technology could be used in Apple's phones and tablets, as well as any wearable technology the firm releases in the future, such as its rumoured iWatch.

The facial expressions, in particular, could be recorded using a phone's camera.

Apple's system could even record how much pressure is applied to a device's screen, in a bid to gauge anger or stress levels.

According to the patent, discovered by AppleInsider: '‘Mood-associated characteristics can define characteristics indicative of a user's mood at a point in time.

'Mood-associated behavioral characteristics can include sequence of content consumed, e.g. sequence of applications launched, rate at which the user changed applications; social networking activities, pressure applied to a touch screen, and/or emotional response to previously served targeted content.

'Mood-associated spatial-temporal characteristics can include location, date, day, time, and/or day part.'

The patent proposes creating a 'baseline mood profile' that will help to create profiles for each emotion.  A 'confidence score' will then be used to estimate the mood.

Apple does explain that the system would be opt-in, and opt-out, and the patent has only been filed - it has not been awarded.
