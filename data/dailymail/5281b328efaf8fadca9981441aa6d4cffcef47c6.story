Five Eastern Europeans were in custody in Paris yesterday after a £1million jewellery raid by up to 15 men brandishing sledgehammers and axes.

Police believe a Roma gipsy gang was behind the well-organised robbery at a Swiss luxury watchmaker’s store in the French capital.

They said staff allowed two well-dressed men to enter the locked Vacheron Constantin store. The men then held open the doors to allow a crowd of hooded accomplices to get in as well.

Raid: The gang had forced their way into the store and stole around 20 watches - worth about £1million

The gang smashed display cabinets at the store near Place Vendome and left with around 20 watches worth up to £1million.

Meanwhile, accomplices outside used smoke grenades to create confusion during the raid, which happened around noon on Friday.

A 24-year-old Romanian and a Moldovan, aged 17, were arrested shortly afterwards, while three more Eastern Europeans were held on Saturday.

France has been hit by a number of 
high-profile jewellery robberies this year, and gangs from Eastern Europe are 
believed to be behind a majority of them.

One, during the Cannes Film 
Festival on the Riviera, saw robbers make off with a necklace 
laced in diamonds and valued at £1.3 million.

In August four men rammed a 
4x4 car into another shop close to Place Vendome. They made off with almost two million pounds worth of luxury watches.

A French jeweler shot dead a teenage robber in 
Nice, also on the Riviera, last month. Despite huge support for owner Stephan Turk, he faces murder charges for shooting the teen as he made off on a getaway scooter.

None was carrying identity papers, but French police are working with police in Romania to try to identify them.

Investigating
 officer Francis Vincenti said the arrested men had fled the scene on 
foot. He said the gang had used force of numbers to terrify staff.

The watches have not been recovered. Other officers said the gang may have received help from Paris’s growing Roma community.

Thousands
 are living in squalor around the city and are getting involved in a 
wide range of crimes including armed robbery and aggressive begging.

‘Their
 crimes usually involve as many people as are needed,’ said one officer.
 ‘Lookouts often include children. There are so many working together 
that they can be impossible to control.’

Some
 believe such scenes will be repeated in Britain when EU labour laws are
 relaxed for Romanians and Bulgarians from January 1 next year, so 
allowing thousands to come to the UK to find work.

At
 present restrictions are imposed on Romanians and Bulgarians who want 
to work in both Britain and France, but there is  a lack of passport 
controls at France’s borders and some 20,000 Roma live there.

France
 has been hit by a number of big jewellery robberies this year, and 
Eastern Europeans are believed to be behind many of them.
