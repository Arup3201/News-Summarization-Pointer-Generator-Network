An Australian tourist and three Tibetans died in an avalanche on Mount Everest on Wednesday.Â

But Mr Higgins, who was part of a Tibetan-led tour group died as a result of altitude sickness and poor health according to reports.

Jessica Darnborough, a spokeswoman for colleagues at Mortgage Choice where Mr Higgins worked, told ABC News that anyone who knew him knew that he was a 'beautiful man'.

The group of 10, which included three herders who acted as porters, two cooks and a tour guide, encountered an avalanche, and Mr Higgins, together with three local herders died.

The Australian Embassy confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man from southern Australia in Tibet.

It said consular officials in Beijing were attempting to contact the man's family to offer assistance.

State broadcaster CCTV said 154 people who had been stranded by the avalanche were rescued Tuesday, 86 at the Everest base camp on the mountain's Chinese side.
