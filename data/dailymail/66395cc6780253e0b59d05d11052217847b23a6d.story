With Monday night’s FA Cup tie between Preston North End and Manchester United live on the BBC, it might be best if the first challenge involving Kevin Davies and Marouane Fellaini takes place after the 9pm watershed.

The reputation of both precedes them; Davies committing more fouls than any other player in Premier League history and ‘Elbows’ Fellaini leaving a trail of victims over the past seven years in England.

At nearly 38, Davies has reached the age where he feels free to say what he thinks. In the case of Fellaini, that is not very much.

‘He caught me under the eye last time we played and it popped up like a balloon. I would liked to have given him the benefit of the doubt but it was a bit naughty.

‘I know it was intentional,’ says Davies, relishing the prospect of meeting him again. The clash came at a Bolton-Everton game in 2011. ‘He was screening me at a goal-kick. David Moyes always put an extra player in front of me and, as the kick came in, Fellaini caught me as I went up to jump. He didn’t jump, his arm shot up instead. There was no apology.

‘Away fans have a pop at me for my style but if I know I have caught someone I will go over and say sorry. There are going to be collisions when you jump to make challenges. But in more than 800 games I have never intentionally hurt someone.’

Fellaini’s size and power were used by Louis van Gaal to see off another lower league side, Cambridge United, in the last round, so it would be no surprise if the Belgian was drafted in again to try to sort out Preston, particularly with Robin van Persie nursing a knock, Radamel Falcao struggling in front of goal, James Wilson untried and Wayne Rooney being used in midfield.

Smarter and more sensitive than his battering-ram image would suggest, Davies is enjoying being centre-stage again.

When Bolton decided not to renew his contract in 2013, many wondered if it was the end of the road for the veteran, who spent two decades at Chesterfield, Southampton, Blackburn, Millwall and, finally, Wanderers. Instead, Preston manager Simon Grayson and chairman Peter Ridsdale bombarded him with calls and texts, even during their summer holidays. ‘They made me feel wanted which was important,’ says Davies. ‘You have to dream in football and here we are, about to face the biggest club in Europe. 

And Manchester United have been significant in his career.

Davies was a 20-year-old hotshot with Southampton when he first played against them, scoring the winner past Peter Schmeichel but also sustaining an injury he believes may have cost him 50 England caps. ‘It was my first season in the Premier League, he says. ‘I was full of confidence and playing without fear — like Harry Kane is now.

‘I scored early — my 12th of the season. Then Denis Irwin and myself had a collision by the halfway line. It wasn’t malicious but I ended up with ankle ligament damage. By the final whistle, I was already in hospital for a scan. It had a lot of repercussions. I came back too early and my ankle went again at Liverpool and I missed my chance of going to the 1998 World Cup.

‘I do think about it. I was playing so well at the time, in the England Under-21s. Without that tackle, I could have got in the full squad and ended up with 50 caps. I still think I’m a better footballer than Emile Heskey (who won 62 caps).’

Eighteen years later, Davies’s right ankle is still heavily swollen and is the subject of curiosity from his current colleagues.

Instead of going to France 98 as an understudy for Alan Shearer, Davies had to wait until he was 33 before making his only England appearance, in a Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro at Wembley. He came on as a substitute for Peter Crouch to partner Wayne Rooney, United’s captain against him tomorrow.

‘I was pumped up so I started shouting, “Come on Wazza, let’s get this going”,’ he recalls. ‘He looked bemused but I needed his help to try and stay in the team!’

Unfortunately for Davies, the game finished 0-0 and he did not win a second cap. But compensation arrived in a fantastic club career, particularly at Bolton, where he is regarded as their greatest forward since Nat Lofthouse.

United memories come tumbling out. His Bolton debut ended up in a 4-0 defeat at Old Trafford. ‘Cristiano Ronaldo made his first appearance in the same game,’ he says. ‘I’d never heard of him — but it didn’t take long to find out.’

There was also the embarrassment of being spotted on camera after a game asking for a signed shirt from Rooney. ‘It was for my son Lucas,’ he says. ‘My youngest one, Leo, will be a mascot tomorrow. He’s five and I did ask him if he’d prefer to walk out with me or Wayne! He had to think about it but he did say me.’

Professionally, Davies is in a good place. He scored his 150th career goal at Coventry last weekend, got a bloodied nose and two assists at Chesterfield on Tuesday and has proved a good mentor for Preston striker Joe Garner, who has 14 goals already this season.

But three months ago, Davies was sure this would be his last season as a player. Preston’s Cup run and promotion push, however, have reinvigorated him.

‘I want to carry on,’ he says. ‘I’m playing, I’m contributing, I haven’t put on any weight and my joints aren’t hurting. If Preston want to keep me, fantastic. If they don’t, hopefully other offers come in.’
