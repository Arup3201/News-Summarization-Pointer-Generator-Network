Labour former home and foreign secretary Jack Straw has accused the Guardian of 'indulgent irresponsibility'

Condemnation of the Guardian for publishing top-secret files intensified yesterday as Jack Straw accused the paper of ‘indulgent irresponsibility’.

In a devastating indictment, the Labour former home and foreign secretary said it had developed a ‘sense of power and almost adolescent excitement’ from holding thousands of classified intelligence documents.

As a result, its journalists - whom he accused of ‘extraordinary naivety and arrogance’ - were ‘blinding themselves about the consequence’ of putting the material in the public domain.

Mr Straw’s criticisms are among the most damning yet about the Guardian’s printing of US and UK government secrets stolen by fugitive National Security Agency worker Edward Snowden.

They are especially potent coming from a former Labour cabinet minister whose tenure in government included lengthy periods overseeing the work of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.

The newspaper continues to insist it will carry on publishing the secrets and yesterday its front page claimed there would be a ‘review’ of surveillance powers initiated by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

But yesterday morning Downing Street dismissed the suggestion outright, with a spokesman for the Prime Minister endorsing the current system of oversight and saying: ‘There is not a Government review.’

Mr Clegg’s aides quickly distanced themselves from the Guardian’s story, saying he was simply ‘posing the question’ about oversight of the security and intelligence agencies.

Meanwhile, other former senior intelligence and security officials lined up to condemn the newspaper and issue further warnings about the damage done by Mr Snowden’s theft of the documents, which are thought to be in the hands of the Russian government.

Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, the Government’s listening station, said the Guardian, and others in possession of the leaked files, had published information that was invaluable to foreign spies, terrorists and criminal networks.

He said it was the ‘most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever’, eclipsing even the leaks by the Cambridge Five, the ring of spies including Kim Philby and Guy Burgess, who were turned by the Soviets.

Last week, before the row exploded, Sir David told BBC’s Newsnight: ‘Not even the KGB in its heyday of Philby, Burgess and [Donald] Maclean could have dreamt of acquiring 58,000 highly classified intelligence documents.

‘My fear is that we are now going to witness a slow motion car crash in which gradually sources dry up, targets such as terrorist and cyber criminals will work out what are the kind of capabilities that we have and they will adapt their methods. It will be harder to track them down.’ But it is Mr Straw’s comments – the first criticism from a senior Labour figure – that are the most incendiary.

In an interview with BBC Sunday Politics Wales, to be broadcast tomorrow, Mr Straw said: ‘The head of the security service, MI5, has been absolutely right to say what he has said, and I regret what I can only describe as indulgent, irresponsibility by the Guardian newspaper.

‘You can always justify everything, if you’re a newspaper, on the grounds that this is open journalism, but this is about much more than journalism, it’s genuinely about how we protect the national interest.

‘And that’s not just about protecting the establishment, it’s about keeping people safe, it’s about avoiding another 7th of July 2005.’ 

Mr Straw said the publication had ‘potentially’ risked lives. He added: ‘I’m not suggesting for a moment that anybody at the Guardian gratuitously wants to risk anybody’s life.

‘But what I do think is their sense of power of having these secrets and excitement, almost adolescent excitement, about these secrets, has gone to their head and they’re blinding themselves about the consequence, and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets which they publish are or are not likely to damage the national interest.

‘And they’re not in any position at all to do that.’

Condemnation of the Guardian began on Tuesday when, in a major speech, the new MI5 director general Andrew Parker said revelations about GCHQ’s techniques were a ‘gift to terrorists’, and had given them the advantage they needed to ‘strike at will’.

His comments were immediately backed by Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May and sparked calls for an inquiry into whether the Guardian should be prosecuted. Mr Clegg has lined up alongside the PM by saying the leaks ‘helped terrorists’.

Nigel Inkster, the former director of operations and intelligence at MI6, said the leaked documents contained ‘an awful lot of operational detail... about ongoing activities which risk being compromised’.

He told Radio 4’s World at One he understood there was a ‘real possibility’ that people could have been put at risk as a result of the leaks.

Mr Inkster warned that terror groups would now be much more aware of GCHQ’s ‘vulnerabilities’ and assessing the damage would be difficult.
