John Grainger was blasted with a shotgun before being decapitated

A man whose headless body was found burning in a car park was blasted with a shotgun as well as being decapitated.

Detectives think the victim - identified as John Grainger, 32 - may have been killed indoors before being taken outside and torched.

His smouldering remains were discovered after firefighters were alerted to a blaze near Wellington Street, Stockport, in the early hours of yesterday.

When they arrived they saw the body, still alight, with the head close by.

Today, his family paid tribute to Mr Grainger saying he was a 'loveable and cheeky character'.

They said in a statement: 'John was a 
cheeky and loveable character who was a fantastic brother and uncle to 
his niece and nephews.

'He wanted to become a dad one day and was looking forward to what the future held.

'John loved football and was an avid fan of Manchester United.'

Post-mortem tests revealed Mr Grainger died of a combination of a shot-gun wound and a 'blunt force injury' to the head before he was decapitated with a bladed instrument.

Police put in place a huge cordon around the area and have been carrying out forensic tests on a flat on the nearby Covent Garden estate.

Supt Pete Matthews, from Greater 
Manchester Police’s Stockport division, said: 'The investigation is in 
its early stages and we are working to establish the circumstances 
surrounding this man’s death.

'We are conducting house-to-house 
inquiries and speaking to local residents and have extra officers in the
area to offer reassurance and assist with the investigation.

The pair, aged 29 and 31, were still in police custody last night.

Firefighters were called after a member of staff at nearby Gala Casino raised the alarm at 4.50am.

The body was found close to the steps leading to the HM Revenue and Customs car park - just yards from Stockport police station.

'Obviously, members of the community will be shocked to hear about what has happened and I would encourage anybody who has concerns to speak to their local officer.

'I understand there are a lot of rumours regarding this incident and it would be wrong to speculate on what has happened however, we are keeping an open mind and looking at every line of inquiry.'
