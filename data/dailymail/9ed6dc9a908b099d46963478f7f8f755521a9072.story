It was the incident that helped convince the Americans to enter the First World War.

But 70 years after RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-boat, it has been revealed civil servants were worried that rumours she was carrying explosives were true and would ‘blow up on us, literally’.

After salvage companies applied to raise the Cunard liner, the Government issued panicked warnings about danger to life, according to National Archives documents.

The liner Lusitania moored in the Mersey, Christmas 1911. 70 years after RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-boat, civil servants are worried that rumours she was carrying explosives were true and would 'blow up on us, literally'

The sinking of the Lusitania on May 7 1915 with the loss of 1,198 lives - 124 of them American - as she neared the end of her run from New York to Liverpool was one of the pivotal events of the war

The sinking of the British passenger ship off Ireland in 1915 – which resulted in the loss of 1,198 lives, 124 of them American – helped swing public opinion in the previously neutral US, which soon entered the war.

Germany claimed she contained explosives and Britain eventually admitted that there were 5,000 cases of small ammunition in the cargo.

Conspiracy theories abounded that there had been a second explosion on the ship, prompting salvage firms to go in search of the haul.

Panicked civil servants wrote that the salvage could prove disastrous if there were explosives in the debris.

NH Marshall in the Foreign Office’s North American department wrote in the 1980s: ‘There is a large amount of ammunition in the wreck, some of which is highly dangerous.’

The MoD searched its records but found no reference to any other munitions in the cargo.

Britain did eventually did disclose that there had been 5,000 cases of small arms ammunition among the cargo - however rumours continued to circulate that she was also carrying dangerous high explosives which contributed to the final disaster

The sinking of the Lusitania on May 7 1915 with the loss of 1,198 lives - 124 of them American - as she neared the end of her run from New York to Liverpool was one of the pivotal events of the war.

It helped swing popular opinion in the hitherto resolutely neutral United States against Germany - paving the way for America's entry into the conflict two years later on the side of Britain and France.

But while British propagandists exploited the attack on unarmed civilians, Germany insisted its action was justified on the grounds the ship was known to be carrying 'large quantities of war material'.

Britain did eventually did disclose that there had been 5,000 cases of small arms ammunition among the cargo - however rumours continued to circulate that she was also carrying dangerous high explosives which contributed to the final disaster.

It was said that the explosives had caused a massive secondary explosion after she was hit by the German torpedo, causing the 790ft Lusitania to sink rapidly before most of those on board had a chance to escape.

Those old claims came back to haunt Whitehall when, in 1982, a salvage company announced that it was planning to survey the wreck.

Papers released by the National Archives at Kew, west London, show how officials feared it could all 'blow up on us' if there were indeed explosives lurking among the debris.
