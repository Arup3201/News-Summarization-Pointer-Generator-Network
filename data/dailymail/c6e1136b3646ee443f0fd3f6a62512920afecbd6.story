An elderly pensioner has died after being accidentally run over by her own husband twice on their driveway, it has been claimed.

Witnesses have said that Jennifer Robinson, 81, had been collecting bags from the boot of the car when her husband inadvertently put the Golf into reverse.

Despite being hit at a 'low speed' outside the block of converted flats in the market town of Caistor, Lincolnshire, Mrs Robinson died of her injuries. 

Emergency services were called to the scene at around midday on Sunday, and Lincolnshire Police confirmed a 76-year-old man was spoken to and was helping police with their inquiries.

Officers are not treating the pensioner's death as suspicious and believe it to be a tragic accident.

Detectives are still urging witnesses who saw anything to come forward and get in touch with them.

A force spokeswoman said: 'Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision in Caistor on Sunday October 5 in which an 81-year-old female pedestrian died.

'The incident happened around midday and involved a silver Volkswagen Golf.

'A 76-year-old man who was also involved in the incident was not injured and is assisting police with inquiries.

'Officers have conducted a number of inquiries in the area and are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident.'

Residents living in the picturesque village have been left shocked by the death of the popular pensioner.

A local resident, who did not wish to be named, said she had been collecting the bags from the boot of the car when her husband inadvertently put the vehicle into reverse.

He added: 'They had come back from Tesco's having done their weekly shop and she went to get the shopping out of the boot.

'Her husband has then put the car into reverse by accident and ran over her, she went beneath the wheels.

'Tragically, he's then panicked and put it into first and ran over her again.

'He must be feeling absolutely terrible, it is so sad.

'They are new to the area but I believe they lived elsewhere in the village before moving here, so they are well known in town.

'It just doesn't bear thinking about what her husband must be going through right now and what he has seen.'

Mrs Robinson was said to be a very well-liked woman in the community of Caistor (stock picture)

A spokeswoman for East Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'We received a call at 11.55am on Sunday to Caistor, Market Rasen, reporting a female in her 80s who had been hit by a car and was suffering serious injuries.

'Our LIVES-community first responders, and Fast Response Vehicle were first on scene.

'Fire Service were called to assist because the patient was badly trapped.

'Despite best effort of those involved, the patient sadly was pronounced dead on scene.'

Fred Cockerton, 77, added: 'We've been told her husband accidentally drove into her, not at great speed but at her age she was obviously quite frail

'She was a very popular woman in the community, although I did not know her personally I've heard she was a lovely lady.

'They were a doting couple too by all accounts and you've got to really feel for the old chap too, you can't imagine how he must be feeling at the moment.'

Another local, who wished to remain anonymous, added: 'What a shame though, it sounds utterly tragic.'

The coroner has since been informed and an inquest into Mrs Robinson's death is expected to open in the next week.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact the Collision Witness Hotline on 01522 558855 or Lincolnshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 177 of 05/10/2014.
