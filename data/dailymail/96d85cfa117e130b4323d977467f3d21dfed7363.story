The two runaway teenagers who sparked an international manhunt after sneaking out of their boarding school have enjoyed an eighth day in the Caribbean, where they don't seem in any great hurry to return home.

Edward Bunyan, 16, and his girlfriend Indira Gainiyeva, 
17, were today pictured strolling in the sunshine at the five-star beach Occidental Grande resort in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.

Whatever punishments their parents have in store appear to have been put on hold, although a chaperone, believed to be Edward's older brother, was sticking close to their side.

The runaways were wearing the same clothes they have been seen in a day earlier, suggesting they had not had much time to pack before they made their bolt for freedom on Monday last week.

The pair are facing expulsion from the £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in 
Clitheroe, Lancashire.

Head teacher Andrew Johnson said he was 'delighted' they had been found, but has refused to discuss what might happen on their return.

Yesterday they were pictured having a tense-looking meal with Edward’s mother, Susannah Bunyan, who had flown out to help the search.

The pair are believed to have ran up an estimated £3,000 credit card bill after they sneaked out 
of  school last Monday and flying to Spain where they caught at second flight to the Caribbean.

They initially checked in to the Occidental Grande resort, where a week's stay costs around £1,600 and are believed to have spent 
several days there quaffing cocktails and enjoying lavish meals.

But as news of their escapades spread they checked in to a dingy £75-a-week apartment nearby.

After
 British police alerted Interpol, local officers spent days scouring 250
 miles of coastline packed with resorts.

They were finally caught late on Sunday when plain clothes police found 
them sitting at a beachside restaurant in the resort of Punta Cana. They had been stocking up on bread and water and dining at cheap beachside restaurants.

On Tuesday Mrs Bunyan frogmarched the sheepish couple from their bolthole to a 
taxi and reluctantly returned them to the luxury hotel where she had 
checked in.

She later accompanied them for a meeting at the police 
station flanked by motorcycle outriders.

The pair, who have been dating for 
months, were seen in beachwear strolling along the ocean in Punta Cana 
and eating outside the hotel - but always being watched.

Ramon
 Brito, spokesman for the local tourist police, said: ‘We located them 
by tracing their credit cards.

'They spent Sunday night at the Sol Caribe
 apartments, in the Los Corales resort in Bavaro. We confirmed that they
 were there, contacted their parents, and the police went in to take 
them to be reunited with their families.

‘The
 hotel owners won’t face any procedures – the youngsters came for a good
 time and behaved well, so there was never any danger to them or 
others.’

At
 around 11pm on Sunday police moved in and picked them up. It is 
understood that they are now in separate rooms at the Occidental and 
that Mrs Bunyan will act as guardian to Indira for the journey back to 
Britain later this week.

Indira’s
 father, Ravil Gainiyev, a businessman in Kazakhstan, said: ‘Everything 
is under control. We now want to take Indira home, back to Kazakhstan.’

It is understood that he and Indira’s mother Firuza spoke to their 
daughter by phone after she was found, but they declined to talk about 
the call.

Stonyhurst
 college had earlier defended its security measures, saying they were 
intended to keep out intruders, not to ‘imprison’ pupils.

Lancashire
 police said: ‘They will be given a welfare de-brief by police following
 their arrival back in this country. This will signal an end of police 
involvement in this matter.’

A source said: ‘Edward’s mother is very, very angry but also hugely relieved and wants to know what got into the pair.

‘She
 desperately wants to know whether her son has been unhappy at boarding 
school and whether he really wants to go back there. But she is also 
very angry at what they did. We understand this stunt cost thousands of 
pounds which he racked up on his credit card. It was like he was living 
like there was no tomorrow.’
