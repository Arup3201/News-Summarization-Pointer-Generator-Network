Jack Wilshere is facing a dressing down from manager Arsene Wenger after he was embroiled in another smoking incident.

The Arsenal midfielder, who is recovering from ankle surgery, was photographed holding a shisha pipe, leading to criticism of the England international.

Wenger, who has been openly critical of players who smoke, will be concerned after Wilshere was caught in yet another compromising situation.

In April 2012, the Gunners manager criticised then Arsenal striker Marouane Chamakh after he was snapped smoking a shisha pipe.

'It's (smoking shisha) is not the best thing to do. We want him to focus completely - without smoking.' The big difference between the two incidents are that Chamakh was clearly smoking the pipe, while Wilshere is merely holding it nowhere near his mouth.

Nevertheless, Wenger will be frustrated that he will have to deal with yet another smoking-related controversy with regards to one of his players.

Speaking in July, Wilshere said: 'The smoking? Of course I regret it. I have been seen before doing it. I said then I made a mistake and I have made a mistake again. People make mistakes.

News of Wilshere's smoking is bound to infuriate manager Arsene Wenger yet again

Shisha or hooka pipes are a way of smoking tobacco, usually mixed with fruit or molasses sugar, through a bowl and hose or tube 

'I am young and I will learn from it. I realise the consequences it has and the effect on kids growing up.

'I have kids myself and I don't want them growing up to think their dad smokes and it is okay for a footballer to smoke, because it's not.

'It is unacceptable and I will accept the consequences and I will move on.' The Arsenal manager will face awkward questions about the photos in tomorrow morning's press conference ahead of Saturday's derby clash against Tottenham.

Wilshere has twice been photographed puffing in public - despite insisting he is not a smoker.

William Gallas, during his time at Arsenal, was also snapped with a cigarette.

And more recently, Wojciech Szczesny was heavily fined by the club for sparking up in the showers at St Mary's following the defeat to Southampton in New Years Day.
