Manchester United believe that Nicky Butt will remain with the club as the Louis van Gaal era dawns at Old Trafford.

One of the graduates of the Class of 1992, Butt is contracted with the club and works alongside Warren Joyce with the under-21 team and manages the under-19 side in the UEFA Youth League.

It is believed that he is set to continue in that position next season. Sportsmail understands that Butt has made no indication to the club that he would be unwilling to continue in his role with a highly-placed source saying: ‘The Class of 92 are very important to Manchester United.

'Nicky is a
 member of staff at the club, he has a position here and he is working 
with Warren Joyce, who will remain at the club.’

Butt
 was promoted to the first-team fold following the sacking of David 
Moyes in April as he assisted close friend Ryan Giggs after the Welshman
 assumed managerial responsibilities at Old Trafford.

Once Van Gaal was handed the job, there were suspicions that the Dutchman 
may look to weed out the influence of the Class of ‘92 to make way for 
his own backroom staff but with Giggs on board as assistant, the new 
manager has indicated his desire to maintain a link with United’s 
heritage.   

However,
 the future of Phil Neville, who followed David Moyes from Everton to 
Manchester United last summer in the position of first-team coach, 
remains clouded in mystery.

It is understood that discussions are continuing at United over whether
 Neville be remain at Old Trafford under Louis van Gaal but it would 
seem unlikely that he will maintain such a senior position at the club 
next season.

A
 United insider was keen to stress that the ‘Class of 92’ are ‘part of 
the fabric of the football club’ but Neville, who is currently working 
as a BBC pundit at the World Cup, is still to be informed what role, if 
any at all, that the club can find for him following the exit of Moyes.

Neville
 may exit as the club look to make a break with the dismal campaign 
endured by Moyes, with Van Gaal having already brought in Marcel Bout as
 his assistant coach, although it could yet be that United find a 
reduced role for the former England international.

As
 for Paul Scholes, United had no plans in place to reintroduce the club 
legend to the coaching staff while Moyes was in charge and as things 
stand, it seems unlikely that he will form a part of Van Gaal’s backroom
 team.

Scholes acted as a temporary assistant manager when Giggs took over for the final four games of the season.

He
 also teamed up with Butt to help his former team-mate coach the United 
youngsters for the UEFA Youth League in the autumn but Sportsmail 
understands that this arrangement was on a purely voluntary, 
non-contracted basis.

Confident: United believe that Butt will stay in his role with the academy under Van Gaal

It
 was orchestrated by Butt, rather than Moyes, and it remained a 
temporary role. It is distinctly possible that he will aid Butt on the 
same, ad-hoc basis next season.

Scholes
 does, however, remain a paid ambassador for Manchester United but he 
has not been contracted on a permanent basis as a member of the coaching
 staff since retiring in the summer of 2013.

His
 chances of earning a senior position under Van Gaal have also been 
dented by his outspoken views in his column for the bookmakers Paddy 
Power, with the 39-year-old particularly critical of United striker 
Wayne Rooney and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, with Scholes 
saying that the United chief has ‘an awful lot to prove this time that 
he's good enough at his job’ in this summer transfer window.
