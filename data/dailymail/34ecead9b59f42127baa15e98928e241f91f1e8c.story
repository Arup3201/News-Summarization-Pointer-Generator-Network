A mother nearly lost her unborn son when she underwent an invasive fertility procedure without knowing she was pregnant.

Natalie Birkett, 35, had her womb and fallopian tubes flushed with dye by doctors investigating why she and her husband Chris, 43, had not been able to conceive after three years of trying.

The receptionist, from Goodmayes, north east London, discovered three weeks later she had been four weeks pregnant at the time of the test.

Natalie and Chris Birkett nearly lost their son, Ethan, when Mrs Birkett had an invasive fertility procedure

Doctors, who before going ahead with the fertility test had ordered a pregnancy test which returned a negative result, told Mrs Birkett they would have expected the dye to have flushed the foetus from her body.

Against the odds, Mrs Birkett’s son Ethan developed to full term and next month he will be two years old.

Mrs Birkett said: ‘I often think of how close we came to losing Ethan. Part of me still can’t believe he survived and how lucky we are.’

Mrs Birkett and her husband, a television presenter and actor, began trying for a child a year after they married in 2007.

She said: ‘For the first year of trying we weren’t in any particular rush - we were too busy enjoying our relationship. But when another year went by and we still didn’t have any luck, I started to think things were seriously wrong.

‘When I was 21 I’d been told I probably had polycystic ovary syndrome but I hadn’t thought much of it. Now I wondered whether it was going to be an impossible barrier to overcome.’

Mr and Mrs Birkett had been trying for a baby for three years without success so decided to have a procedure in which Mrs Birkett's womb and fallopian tubes were flushed to remove any blockages

Mrs Birkett took a pregnancy test before she underwent the procedure but it came back negative. As a result, she didn't know she was pregnant with Ethan when she had the surgery

In August 2011 Mrs Birkett was offered a fertility test through a gynaecological laparoscopy under general anaesthetic at Whipps Cross University Hospital in London.

Before undergoing the test, during which dye would be sent through her womb and fallopian tubes to detect and dislodged any blockages, she was given a pregnancy test.

She said: ‘I didn’t think there was a lot of point in taking a test - we’d been trying to conceive for years with no luck. So when the test said I was negative I wasn’t surprised.’

She was told to rest in bed for two weeks, after which she developed some familiar symptoms.

She said: ‘I felt nauseous and had been fainting. My mum wondered whether I was pregnant and although I laughed her words off at first, it must have had an effect because I took another test.

Doctors were amazed that Ethan survived the procedure unharmed as they thought he would have been washed out of his mother's womb by the dye that was flushed through it

Mrs Birkett only realised she was pregnant when she started feeling sick and faint and her mother suggested that she should take a pregnancy test

‘When the result came back as positive, I was overcome with joy. I screamed with happiness so loudly that my husband thought I’d fallen down the stairs.’

But the joy was short-lived when a prenatal doctor warned her the dye procedure could have damaged her unborn son.

Mrs Birkett said: ‘I had to wait another five weeks until my 12 week scan, when we would find out if my baby was alright.

‘We knew the baby had survived, but we didn’t know whether there would be complications. No-one knew whether the dye had affected the foetus.

Mrs Birkett said: 'I often think of how close we came to losing Ethan. Part of me still can't believe he survived and how lucky we are'

Mrs Birkett said: 'When the [pregnancy test] came back as positive, I was overcome with joy. I screamed with happiness so loudly that my husband thought I'd fallen down the stairs'

‘At first I wondered whether there had been a mix-up with the pregnancy test which was ordered before the dye flushing, but that possibility was discounted. My only thought was that my hormones weren’t at the right levels at the previous test.’

Such fertility tests, performed with keyhole surgery, are quite common and often result in increased fertility among patients because blockages are removed from the reproductive system as the dye makes its way through the body.

Before the tests medics are careful to order pregnancy tests to protect undetected foetuses from being flushed away.

Ethan is about to celebrate his second birthday and his parents say they 'love him to bits'

Mrs Birkett (pictured with her husband on the day they met) said: 'Me and Chris are both loud, upbeat people, and Ethan is like both of us combined. He's always on the go'

Amazingly, the 12-week scan was fine and little Ethan was born on April 19, 2012.

Mrs Birkett said: ‘Me and Chris are both loud, upbeat people, and Ethan is like both of us combined. He’s always on the go and we love him to bits.

‘Getting to Mother’s Day this year was joyous.

‘Behind everything we do as a family is the knowledge of the struggles we went through to have a baby.’
