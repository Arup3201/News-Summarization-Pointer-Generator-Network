On Friday, she had dropped off her daughter with a friend so she could attend a party in Atlanta later that evening. But she failed to collect her daughter the next day, sparking concern from relatives.

Gwinnett County police told WSB TV that they already have a person of interest in custody in connection with the alleged murder but he has not been charged with any wrongdoing.

'(It's) fair to call him a person of interest but he has been in custody far before we had this crime scene,' said Gwinnet County Police Cpl. Jake Smith.

'He was actually in custody in the Gwinett County Jail without bond for about 48 hours now. 'His name is Charles Outlaw, he is one of the last people seen with her, but he is not charged in this crime by any means.'

'She was a great person and good mother. I'm going to miss her dearly,' a friend told WSB.

Rabotte's ex-boyfriend and the father of her daughter, Darrell Campbell, broke down after he heard the tragic news.
