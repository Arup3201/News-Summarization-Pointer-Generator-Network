The guests at this hotel used to be a select few, but the criteria for clientele is no longer so selective.

Now the only occupants of this once grand venue in Erzgebirge, Germany are the flies and cockroaches scuttling through the deserted corridors.

The EisenBahner (Railwaymen) Hotel, found in Eastern Germany, has been derelict for 25 years, and its 25 double bedrooms, restaurant and kitchen lie in ruin.

The fixtures and furniture remain a dated reminder to the Cold War days of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), when the hotel was booming.

Bygone era: These moment-in-time images were taken by German photographer Stefan Dietze, 31, of Leipzig

These moment-in-time images were taken by German photographer Stefan Dietze, 31, of Leipzig, Germany.

Stefan says, 'I heard about the location through a friend whose father used to work in the hotel.

'He told me that the place was abandoned for years while all the furniture was still intact and inside.

'A long time ago it used to be an old convalescent home, only to be used by employees of the railway company, the 'Reichsbahnamt', and their families.

'It was a pretty prestigious place back than and only the elite had access to it.

Gutted: Located on the edge of a forest in the mountainous Erzgebirge region of Germany, the secluded hotel was rebuilt in 1883, after suffering a fire

Sick home: In 1958 the renovated hotel became a convalescent home for the Reichsbahnt - workers of Germany's national railway system

Forgotten: After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunion of West and East Germany, the old GDR state owned vacation homes that were no longer needed and the hotel began its decline

'Being inside the hotel was like travelling back in time. One could really feel the socialist glory of the old days with all the limited comfort the system could offer. But, for me, growing up in the GDR it brought back many memories of my childhood.

'The place has a morbid charm to it. The air that day was crystal clear, and luckily the sun was shining through the windows when I went in. You can see the reflection in the pictures of the kitchen.'

Limited comfort: Stefan said he could 'really feel the socialist glory of the old days with all the limited comfort the system could offer'

Abandoned: Stefan said when he walked into the kitchen, 'it looked like someone had just done the washing up and left the pots and lids to dry, but then never returned for the next meal'

After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunion of West and East Germany, the old GDR state owned vacation homes that were no longer needed and the hotel began its decline.

Stefan, who spent two hours inside the abandoned building, says: 'I've noticed that the recreation homes inside the former East Germany had a very uniform look to them because of the small variety of furniture, lamps, bed sheets, which were produced inside the small country.

'It must have been a very busy place in the '70s and '80s, with a popular restaurant and a big kitchen to serve all the tourists and guests.
