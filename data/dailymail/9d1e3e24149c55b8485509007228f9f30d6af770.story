CCTV footage of the moment Boris Nemtsov was murdered on Great Moskvoretsky Bridge has emerged, with Russian media reporting his killer was driven away in a getaway car (above) after appearing on foot

He appears to get into a passing car shortly before midnight. Mr Nemtsov's bullet-ridden body was removed from the scene hours later.

It comes after a spokesman for Vladimir Putin said on Saturday the shootings had 'all the hallmarks of a contract hit'.

Critics have attributed blame for the murder to the Russian President, claiming his government feared that an incriminating report Mr Nemtsov had been working on would be made public.

The findings are said to present evidence linking Putin's regime to the Ukrainian crisis which has seen thousands slaughtered.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko fingered the Russian leader as the culprit of Mr Nemtsov's death, with mourners at the scene where he was shot also alluding to his murder as having been politically engineered.

Placards reading 'Je suis Boris' and 'We are all Nemtsov' in Russian were among mounds of flowers with critics likening the father of two's death to the murder of Charlie Hebdo journalists.

A handful were killed by Islamic Extremists in January at the political magazine's Parisian office. The attack was widely described as an affront on free speech.

Earlier it was claimed Mr Nemtsov was killed in a drive-by shooting with his assailants making off in a white vehicle.

The footage revealed by Russian website TBU however suggests his murderer may have been waiting for him on foot before being driven off in a getaway car in a seamless, organised hit.

The married politician is understood to have had dinner with his 23-year-old Ukrainian girlfriend on Friday in the hours before his death.

The pair were seen walking across the bridge, just feet away from the Kremlin, before Mr Nemtsov was shot four times.

The white car (pictured) that carried the assassins has reportedly been found by police not far from where the leader was murdered. Footage released on Sunday suggested his shooter may have been on foot and driven away after the killing

The father-of-four was shot four times by assailants previously reported as having been in a white car as he walked across a bridge over the Moskva River

Mr Nemtsov was seen speaking on his mobile phone at a radio station, just hours before he was killed

Mourners laid flowers at the site on Saturday afternoon as critics of the Russian president alleged Mr Nemtsov's murder was politically motivated

Among mounds of flowers and candles left on the bridge in central Moscow are signs reading 'Je suis Boris' and 'We are all Nemtsov' in Russian claiming the 55-year-old was killed for openly criticising Putin in an attack on free speech

Ms Duritskaya was questioned by Russian police extensively following the killing having escaped unharmed.

Weeks ago Mr Nemtsov told of how he feared for his life after identifying himself as a staunch critic of Putin's government.

The 55-year-old said he was certain the Russian President would kill him in a February 10 interview. His 87-year-old mother warned him against publicly lambasting the leader.

On Saturday she received a telegram from Putin in which he described her son's murder as 'vile and cynical'.

A spokesman for the Kremlin denied it had any involvement in Mr Nemtsov's death but said it had hallmarks of a 'contract hit'.

An investigating committee said it was pursuing several lines of inquiry including one which claimed the murder was designed to drum up support for an anti-government rally Mr Nemtsov was due to attend.

It claimed he may have been made a martyr for the opposition party's cause, thought his has been dismissed by protesters maintaining Putin is to blame.

Speaking of the report Mr Nemtsov had been working on, President Poroshenko said: 'Somebody was afraid of this, Boris wasn't afraid. Killers and executors were afraid.'

Meanwhile opposition activists also blamed the Russian President for his death, claiming they were in 'no doubt' it was politically motivated.

'I have no doubt this was a political killing. The only threat to his life came from his political activity. He had no foes other than political ones.',' said Ilya Yashin.

Among placards left on mounds of flowers were some reading 'je suis Boris', 'Putin killed my friend' and 'we are all Nemtsov'. 

World leaders have insisted on transparency as investigations into Mr Nemtsov's death continue. David Cameron described the murder as 'callous', while Ban Ki-moon said it was 'brutal.'

Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in Moscow at the age of 55.

His 87-year-old mother Dina had a premonition that her son would be killed, according to the politician.

He told earlier this month how his mother warned him: 'When will you stop cursing Putin? He'll kill you for that.' 

Nemtsov studied physics at State University of Gorky and earned a PhD in Physics and Mathematics.

In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, Nemtsov organised a protest movement in his hometown, which prevented the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the region. 

The liberal reformer rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin and became a fierce critic of Vladimir Putin.

Nemtsov first gained an international profile after being spotted by former British premier Margaret Thatcher as a future leader of Russia.

She praised his market reforms after visiting Nizhny Novgorod where as governor in the early 1990s he led spearheaded reforms.

The father-of-four, 55, was Deputy Prime Minister of Russia from 1997 to 1998 during Boris Yeltsin's presidency.

He was sentenced to 15 days in jail in January 2011 after being arrested at a New Year's Eve protest rally for 'disobedience towards police'. 

The politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the Russian parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition Republican Party of Russia - People's Freedom Party since 2012.

He was a prominent and vocal critic of Mr Putin and wrote a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and his inner circle to corruption.

It has been reported that Nemtsov angered Putin's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, his hometown.

He has written more than 60 academic publications about quantum physics, thermodynamics and acoustics and  designed n of antennas for space apparatuses.

Jewish advocacy website AJC named Nemtsov as one of the most prominent Jews in Russia thanks to his mother's heritage. 

In his 1997 memoir, The Provincial Man, Nemtsov revealed that he was baptised Russian Orthodox in secret.

He leaves behind his wife Raisa Akhmetovna and four children.
