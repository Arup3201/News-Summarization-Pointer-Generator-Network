When is a $100 bill not worth $100? When it's in Mississippi, where it's worth $116. Or in Hawaii, where the value shrinks to just $85. 

A new map by the non-partisan Tax Foundation reveals that the cost of living difference between states means the value of the cash in your pocket varies wildly.

The Tax Foundation used federal data on regional price variations to calculate just how far a Ben Franklin goes in all 50 states.

And the differences are striking. A dollar is worth 30percent more in Mississippi than it is in Washington, D.C - which has the highest prices in the country.

The Tax Foundation used new federal data to show that $100 goes a lot farther in some states than others - and it varies by up to 30percent, based on prices differences between regions

The Tax Foundation showed how residents of Kansas are actually richer than New York residents after factoring in the price of goods

The states $100 goes the farthest are: Mississippi ($115.74), Arkansas ($114.16), Missouri ($113.51), Alabama (113.51), and South Dakota ($113.38). The states where $100 is worth the least are: District of Columbia ($84.60), Hawaii ($85.32), New York ($86.66), New Jersey ($87.64), and California ($88.57).

In some states, $100 is still just $100. In Illinois a C-note is worth $99.40. In Florida and Oregon, it's worth $101.21.

Tax Foundation says the regional cost differences, which were recently released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for the first time ever, could help Americans rethink the places that they live.

For instance, Oklahoma has a significantly lower average income compared to New York ($37,000 vs $45,000). Adjusted for cost of living differences, however, Oklahoma jumps several places in the rankings and New York falls several places - making the real average income in Oklahoma $41,000 and just $39,000 in New York.

All this means that $50,000 after taxes in a high cost of living state like New York is really worth just $43,000. That same $50,00 in Oklahoma actually feels more like $56,000. 

The public policy implications are also immense; $100 in food assistance to a poor family in Washington, D.C., would buy less than $85 worth of food, while it will buy nearly $116 in Mississippi. 

The Bureau of Economic Analysis introduced the federal government's first-ever statistics on regional price differences in April.

The data to calculate the cost of living variation across the country is culled from Consumer Price Index information.

The CPI continually measures the cost of a 'basket of goods' in cities across the nation to keep track of inflation. The data, however, also provides insight into price differences in communities across the country.

The CPI testers keep track of prices of things like:
