A woman charged with defacing the Washington National Cathedral and suspected in a spree of paint attacks in the nation's capital was held without bond on Tuesday.

Jia M. Tian, 58, a Chinese national in the U.S. on an expired visa was carrying a soda can containing green paint when she was arrested at the cathedral on Monday.

Tian has been linked to at least four other 
incidents of vandalism, including at the Lincoln Memorial, according to 
prosecutors and court documents.

In another church near Thomas Circle, Tian allegedly splashed the organ with a mixture of white paint, feces and urine.

Vandal: The woman appeared in D.C. Superior Court on alongside a Mandarin translator

The woman appeared in D.C. Superior Court Tuesday alongside a Mandarin translator. Police had previously identified her as Jiamei Tian.

D.C. police Chief Cathy L. Lanier told NewsChannel8 that the paint incidents are likely to be connected and that the woman may have 'mental health issues.'

Authorities also said that Tian appears to speak very little English and her motives remain unclear.

Tian woman was arrested Monday at the National Cathedral, where she is accused of using green paint to deface an organ and decorative woodwork in two separate chapels.

She's been charged with defacing and destroying private property. Authorities believe the green paint vandalism was part of a pattern of similar acts.

Green paint was discovered splattered onto the Lincoln Memorial early Friday morning, and it was found later Friday on a statue outside the Smithsonian headquarters on the National Mall, as reported by Wusa9.com.

The woman, who has a Chinese passport, arrived in Washington a few days ago and was traveling on an expired visa, prosecutors said.

Police said she had no fixed address but that she told officers she lived in Los Angeles.

According to court documents, the woman is also suspected of vandalizing a statue of Martin Luther on Thomas Circle in downtown Washington, which was also hit with green paint.

Following her arrest, a witness contacted police and reported that the woman had been seen attending a service at a church less than a block from Thomas Circle, according to court documents.

The witness reported that the woman was carrying three bags with her. After she left, the witness found that a pipe organ in the church had been splattered with white paint, urine and feces, documents show.

Turning green: The woman was arrested Monday on charges she vandalized two chapels at Washington, DC's National Cathedral with green paint.

Tian was arrested inside the cathedral on Monday afternoon, shortly after the still-wet green paint was discovered there.

When
 a police officer approached her, she walked away and placed the soda 
can with green paint inside one of three bags that were sitting on 
chairs in the chapel, documents show.

She also had green paint on her clothing, shoes and body, according to the documents.

She
 was wearing a multicolored sock on her right arm, and a similar sock 
was found in a trash can in a bathroom at the cathedral on top of a can 
of green paint, according to the documents.

The bags placed in the chapel also had cans of green paint in them, the documents show.

Cleanup
 crews have been working for the past few days to remove the paint from 
the Lincoln Memorial. Cleanup and restoration work at the cathedral was 
estimated to cost $15,000.

The Episcopal cathedral serves as the nation's spiritual home and has hosted state funerals and inaugural prayer services.

Green paint was found early Friday 
morning on the Lincoln Memorial, and symbols were found painted in green
 later Friday on another statue on the Mall.

The Lincoln Memorial was closed temporarily but reopened later Friday.

Officials
 at the cathedral discovered the paint inside two chapels Monday 
afternoon. It was still wet, which led them to believe the vandalism had
 just occurred.

Officials called police immediately and closed the cathedral to visitors while authorities searched the grounds.

The
 paint was splashed onto an organ and on the floor inside the 
cathedral's historic Bethlehem Chapel on the basement level, officials 
said. It was also found inside Children's Chapel in the nave of the 
cathedral.

Multiple targets: A statue Joseph Henry outside the Smithsonian Institution on the National Mall was also targeted by a vandal using green paint

Historical: Joseph Henry, whose statue is just outside the Smithsonian Institution's main building on the National Mall, was the museum's first secretary

Also Monday, U.S. Park Police said 
green paint was found on the statue of Joseph Henry outside the 
headquarters of the Smithsonian Institution on the Mall. Henry was the 
Smithsonian's first secretary.

Meanwhile,
 crews continued working Monday to remove the paint from the Lincoln 
Memorial. The National Park Service said progressively stronger 
substances would be used until all the paint is gone, which could take 
several days. The memorial was scheduled to be power washed Tuesday.

He noted that while the paint appeared to be 
splattered indiscriminately on the memorial, the statue appeared to have
 been deliberately painted. The symbols on the statue were not 
immediately decipherable.

Other targets: The nearby Lincoln Memorial was also vandalized in the area

Bethlehem Chapel has surveillance cameras, but it wasn't immediately clear whether the vandalism was captured on video, said Richard Weinberg, a cathedral spokesman.

D.C. police said paint from the cathedral would likely be sent to the FBI for testing.

Bethlehem Chapel was opened in 1912 and is the oldest section of the cathedral. It was the site of President Woodrow Wilson's burial rites, and his remains were entombed there for more than three decades.

Wilson's remains were later interred in a memorial bay on the cathedral's main level.
