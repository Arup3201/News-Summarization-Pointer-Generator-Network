Evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested for years in Houston, Texas, have turned up 850 hits in the FBI's nationwide database of DNA profiles. 

But as the city marked a major step in its $6 million effort to address the backlog, officials admitted that there were some cases where suspects committed other sex crimes while evidence that could have identified them sat untested.

So far charges have been filed against 29 people, six of whom have been convicted, since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits.

Some of the kits date back as far as 1987.

Testing was completed in the fall, and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare DNA profiles of possible suspects, Mayor Annise Parker said.

'This milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago,' Parker said at a news conference.

Police are continuing to review the matches to see if charges can be filed in other cases.

In the cases where prosecutors have won convictions, defendants have received sentences ranging from two to 45 years in prison.

One case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case.

In some of the 850 matches the correct person had already been convicted.

Houston Mayor Annise Parker said that the backlog 'is not a Houston problem. It's not a Texas problem. It's a nationwide issue that built up over years and years' 

Rape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspect's DNA.

Testing results are uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS.

A hit means that a suspect's DNA already was in a national law enforcement database in connection with an earlier crime.

Of those that went on to commit other crimes, while it is likely that they could have been identified at the time because their DNA was already in CODIS, it is difficult to tell if kits would have contained enough to provide an accurate profile given available technology.

'Now that the testing of these kits is complete, we know that it's up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims. The ball is in our court and we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible,' Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said.

In the case that led to the 45-year prison sentence, Eddy Montiel, 33, plead guilty to aggravated sexual assault, the Houston Chronicle reported. 

According to court documents, the assault occurred in May 2003. He broke into the victim's East End home in the morning and woke her, asking for money.

When the victim, 38 at the time, said she didn't have any and attempted to fight him off, Montiel began smothering her with a pillow.

She pleaded with him to stop, asking him 'how can you do this, don't you have a mother,' he then raped her, occasionally brandishing a pocket knife.

When he left, he took her cell phone and ripped the house phone off the wall.

The victim was afraid to call the police because she worried it might affect her immigration status, but a coworker convinced her to call in the assault, and she agreed to take a sexual assault kit test.

It is unclear why her kit went untested, but while it sat, Montiel went on to commit and be convicted of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit sexual assault.

He was also later sentenced for two aggravated sexual assault cases and indecency with a child.

Experts say Houston's backlog — and similar backlogs in other U.S. cities — are due in part to the high cost of testing which can run from $500 to $1,000 per kit. 

Advocates argue that the lack of testing signals that sex crimes haven't always been law enforcement priorities.

Mayor Parker advocates the work of Houston's specially designed taskforce as a model for other cities to follow.

More than 12,000 kits went untested for years in Memphis, Tennessee, which is facing a lawsuit from rape victims as it tries to test the kits.

In Detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009, and Cleveland prosecutors have sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing.

'This is not a Houston problem. It's not a Texas problem. It's a nationwide issue that built up over years and years,' Parker said.
