Daisy Lowe is set to don one of fashion’s trendiest new accessory labels in a forthcoming ad campaign for Charlotte Simone.

The London-based brand’s founder, Charlotte Beecham, announced the 25-year-old model and actress as her newest campaign girl on Instagram last week.

In a behind-the-scenes snap, Miss Lowe is seen reclining in an old-fashioned footed bathtub wearing romantic lingerie and surrounded by the label’s sumptuous fur and faux-fur stoles.

In becoming the face of Charlotte Simone, Miss Lowe replaces former brand ambassador Rita Ora.

While the brand only launched in 2011, it has quickly become a celebrity favourite, having been seen around the necks of style influencers including Alexa Chung, Olivia Palermo, Sienna Miller, Millie Mackintosh and Kelly Brook.

Miss Beecham founded the label in her bedroom while studying at NYU. In just a short time her brand has amassed more than 120 stockists across the globe - largely thanks to her celebrity following.

But 
while the colourful fur hoods, cuffs and ‘popsicles’ – which cost from 
£155 ($255) - have become her signature, Miss Beecham says she doesn't 
consider herself a 'fur label'.

'We've
 become known for fur pieces - like the fur-trimmed hood and the 
colourful popsicle scarf - but everything also comes in faux fur,' she 
told Vogue.co.uk last year, adding that sometimes the faux pieces look 
even better than the real fur.

Unlike many new fashion labels, Miss Beecham's collections are not solely geared towards twentysomething trendsetters.

‘Everything
 from the hood, to the cuff, to the popsicle can be worn in several ways
 - and I love to see them being styled in different ways by different 
girls,’ she said. 'My mum might wear something that Rita Ora has worn, 
but in a totally different way - I think that's so cool.’

She has since returned to London where she now operates from a formal studio.
