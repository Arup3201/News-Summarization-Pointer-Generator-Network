Vice President Joe Biden visited the devastated family of slain NYPD officer Wenjian Liu after delivering and emotional eulogy to Rafael Ramos during his funeral on Saturday.

He and his wife Jill spent 25 minutes in the Brooklyn home of the 32-year-old officer's widow and his family after the funeral service for his 40-year-old partner. 

Thousands of officers line the streets of Queens to pay their respects to Ramos who was shot and killed last week alongside his partner. 

Vice President Joe Biden arrives with his wife Jill for the funeral of Rafael Ramos at the Christ Tabernacle Church in Queens where he delivered a eulogy. After the ceremony he visited the home of his slain officer Wenjian Liu 

When he was invited on stage at the Christ Tabernacle Church, he spoke directly to the murdered officers family while standing in front of the casket.

He began by saying: 'There is little anyone can say or do at this moment to ease this sense of loss, this sense of loneliness.

Biden then went on to say: 'When an assassin's bullet targeted two officers, it targeted this city and it touched the soul of the entire nation.

'There will come a time when Rafael's memory will bring a smile to your lips instead of a tear to your eye. My prayer for you is that it will come sooner rather than later.'

Following the touching speech he then travelled to Brooklyn where he spoke to Liu's family.  

According to the New York Daily News, Biden told the father: 'These people will be with you your whole life (referring to the NYPD). 'You now have a family larger than you ever thought you'd have.'

During his speech Biden also touched on the marked increase in the racial diversity of the city's police force, which only a few decades ago was almost entirely white.

'I believe that this great police force of this incredibly diverse city can and will show the nation how to bridge any divide.'

During his touching tribute he said Ramos' death had 'touched the soul of the entire nation',  and also spoke directly the victim's family who were sat in the front row

At the end of the funeral he spoke to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of the many other dignitaries there to pay their respects 

The ceremony was later marked by an unusual protest against Mayor Bill de Blasio.

As he rose to deliver the customary mayoral eulogy, thousands of uniformed officers outside silently turned their backs on him in a pointed display of disrespect as his image filled the large screens broadcasting the service.

Angered by the mayor's qualified sympathy for nationwide demonstrations calling for police reform, some New York police officers had similarly shunned de Blasio as he arrived a week ago at the hospital where Ramos and his police partner, Wenjian Liu, were declared dead.

'He believed in protecting others,' de Blasio said as he stood behind Ramos' coffin, which was draped in the police department's flag and bathed in blue light, 'and those who are called to protect others are a special breed.'
