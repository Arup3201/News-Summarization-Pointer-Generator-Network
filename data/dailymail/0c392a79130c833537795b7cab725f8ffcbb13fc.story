Reigning champion jockey Richard Hughes moved to within four of title-race leader Ryan Moore with a hat-trick at Newbury on Friday.

Hughes rides at the Berkshire track as well as Wolverhampton on Saturday as he continues his charge towards a third jockeys' championship.

Highlight of his three-timer was Marsh Hawk, who justified her odds-on favouritism with a three-and-a-half length win from Timba in the Dubai Duty Free Full Of Surprises EBF Fillies' Conditions Stakes.

She will now be stepped up in grade. Trainer Richard Hannon said: 'She'll go for a Group One now, it will be the Fillies' Mile or the Prix Marcel Boussac. She's definitely entered in France but may have to be supplemented for Newmarket where the track would suit her.

'She's very relaxed and is a filly that doesn't always show you much at home, reserving her best for the track.'

Hannon's Desert Force (8-1) appeared to appreciate the rain-softened ground in the Al Basti Equiworld EBF Maiden Stakes as he held off the William Haggas-trained favourite Foreign Diplomat by a length.

Hannon said: 'He was impressive and I would say that wasn't a bad maiden. I'm not sure what he'll do next but it wouldn't bother me if I put him away for the rest of the year.'

The double for the Hannon stable was very timely.

Hannon's father, Richard senior, said: 'It was an expensive night for us as storms washed away some of our all-weather gallop which will cost £25,000 to put right. Maybe this will alleviate a portion of that bill.'

Hughes also won the three-runner Dubai Duty Free Conditions Stakes as 10-11 favourite Code Of Honour got back on the winning trail in the blue of Godolphin.

The winner was having his first run since being gelded and Tommy Burns, representing Godolphin Saeed bin Suroor, said: 'This should have done his confidence the world of good.

'There are no definite plans but I would think he'll be one for the Dubai Carnival.'
