There is not yet an identikit for the next Celtic manager. Chief executive Peter Lawwell has pledged that the board will both take their time and use open minds when it comes to selecting Neil Lennon's replacement.

In the impressive figure of Malky Mackay, however, there is a candidate who might well match many of the criteria that could be considered.

Former Celtic player? Check. Young and ambitious? Check. Experience at the top level of the game? Check. Out of work and available? Check.

Interest: It is thought that Malky Mackay would be willing to speak to Celtic about their vacancy

It is thought that Mackay would be willing to speak to the Parkhead club about their vacancy. But he also remains a man in demand south of the border. His name is currently being considered in the boardroom at West Bromwich Albion.

Tempting him to continue his career in the more constrained Scottish environment may not be entirely straightforward. One man who has worked closely with Mackay throughout his management career to date is adamant, though, that it would be worth every ounce of effort.

Scotland midfielder Don Cowie played under the 42-year-old at both Watford and Cardiff and has no doubt Mackay would thrive if handed the reins at Celtic.

'I think Malky ticks a lot of boxes,' Cowie told Sportsmail. 'He is an ex-Celtic player so the fans will be fully aware of him – and he understands the club. 

'He is still young in management terms and has done very well in his career so far.

'I'm sure he is desperate to get back in quickly. The Celtic job would probably suit him perfectly. He is available and I can see no reason why he is not the man for it.'

Mackay's time at Cardiff came to a controversial end when a breakdown in his relationship with owner Vincent Tan led to a well-trailed sacking last December. Even by the modern standards of the English game, it was a development which led to an outpouring of sympathy for the Glaswegian.

He had led Cardiff into the top flight for the first time in 53 years and left them sitting one point above the relegation zone. The Welsh club eventually finished bottom of the Barclays Premier League, six points short of safety.

His dismissal did not, therefore, do any significant damage to a reputation that has grown since he took charge of Watford back in 2009. Former Inverness man Cowie was there from the start.

'When I first went to Watford, he was a coach under Brendan Rodgers at the time,' the 31-year-old recalled. 'But I could see he was ready to do more than he was doing.

'Brendan was very much a hands-on manager and took a lot of the training. Malky had to bide his time for a number of months and it took Brendan leaving for Reading for him to get the opportunity to take the Watford job. He grabbed it with both hands. 

'Malky is not that long out of the changing room. He knows how players feel and how they want to be treated.

'You know that you can have a laugh with him but, at the same time, you are very aware you don't want to cross the line. His door is always open if you want to have a chat. But he will soon let you know if your standards have dropped or if he thinks you are not putting the effort in.

Interest: Don Cowie is currently weighing up the offer of a new contract at Cardiff

'He did very well at Watford with a not very big budget at all. He then got the move to Cardiff and a team that had fallen short at the last hurdle on a number of occasions.

'Malky was the man picked to get them into the Premier League and that's exactly what he did in his second year.

'He had done it a few times as a player and knew exactly what it took to get over the line. His first year was about transition and building the squad. But we managed to get the job done in the second year and that was a great achievement.' 

Mackay's profile rose in accordance with Cardiff's success, yet the spotlight he would face at Celtic would be of substantially greater wattage.

The environment in Glasgow can be stifling for those in the lead roles. It is a situation that requires a certain type of character. Again, though, Cowie believes Mackay has what it takes.

'I know being a manager of the one of the Old Firm clubs isn't easy,' he recognised. 'It's not just back page stuff, you are on the front page as well.

'There is huge scrutiny on you and the passion from the fans is incredible. You are in the public eye all the time.

'But I think Malky has shown he can handle that kind of situation. It's not something that's great to talk about but the scenario at Cardiff with the owner wasn't ideal.

'But Malky conducted himself in a certain manner and was still willing to put himself out to the media. On the dressing room side, I could see how well he was handling it. He didn't allow the players to get caught up in it or for it to be used as any kind of excuse. 

'He keeps all external stuff away from his players and I'm fairly confident he could handle anything that is thrown at him should he end up at Celtic.' 

Cowie is currently weighing up the offer of a new contract at Cardiff amid reported interest from Blackburn Rovers. Wherever he ends up next, he will never forget the influence Mackay has had on him.

'My Watford contract was out at the same time as he took the Cardiff job,' Cowie said. 'He asked me to come and join him again and I was confident Malky was the person who could get that club promotion. 

'We did just that and I managed to play in the Premiership. I also added ten Scotland caps while working under him. So he has been a great help to my career and I will always be in debt to him.'
