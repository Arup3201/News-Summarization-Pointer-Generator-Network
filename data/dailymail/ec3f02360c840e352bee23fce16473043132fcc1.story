Convicted: Waseem Daker, now 35, spent a decade behind bars for stalking Loretta Blatz; he was found guilty of killing her roommate

Jurors near Atlanta on Friday convicted a man accused in the strangling death of a flight attendant in 1995 and the stabbing of her young son.

The jury began deliberating shortly before 10 a.m. Friday and returned a guilty verdict against Waseem Daker in less than five hours. 

The 35-year-old was indicted on 11 counts, including malice and felony murder, burglary, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and attempted aggravated stalking.

Daker is charged in the October 23, 1995 killing of Karmen Smith in her Cobb County home.

Prosecutors say he also repeatedly stabbed Smith's 5-year-old son Nick, who survived the attack.

Daker killed Smith and attacked her son because he was obsessed with Lottie Spencer Blatz, who lived upstairs from them, prosecutors said. Daker was convicted of stalking Blatz in 1996. 

Authorities had long suspected Daker but couldn't connect him to the slaying until new DNA testing linked him to Smith's death in 2009.

Daker did not react as the verdict against him was read, The Marietta Daily Journal reported.

But several of Smith's relatives and friends showed relief, including Blatz and Nick Smith, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Both Blatz and Nick Smith had testified against Daker.

Jurors asked the judge during deliberations for permission to replay a portion of taped telephone conversations that allegedly occurred between Daker and Blatz on October 13 and 14, about a week before the slaying, and a portion of a taped interview Daker had with Cobb County Police Detective Brad McIntyre after the slaying.

Daker objected to the jury hearing only portions of the tapes, and wanted them to hear the whole thing, but Superior Court Judge Mary Staley overruled the objection.
