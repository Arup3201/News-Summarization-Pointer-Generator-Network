The home that inspired one of the most famous paintings in American history could soon be in search of a tenant.

If you're keen on living the quiet life in Eldon, Iowa (pop. 900) and have around just $250 per month, the house featured in Grant Wood's 1930 masterpiece American Gothic could be the home for you.

The pitchfork, however, won't be included.

Look familiar? The house that played backdrop to Grant Wood's 1930 masterpiece American Gothic is now without a tenant as of Monday

American favorite: The somehow equally stoic, comical and unsettling painting has become one of the most parodied works of art of all time

Isolated: The house is in Eldon, Iowa, a town of 900

In fact, the State Historical Society of Iowa has yet to decide if they intend to again rent out the 700-square-foot 1882 home after tenant of four years Beth Howard moved out.

'There should be a statute of limitations for how long one can live in a tourist attraction,' she joked to the Des Moines Register Tuesday.

Monday marked Beth Howard's last day in the house..

And who knows, you may gain artistic inspiration from the home, as Wood did and as Howard did thereafter. 

Wood was an Iowa painter who spotted the house while traveling through the area. He used it as the backdrop to his 1930 painting of a farmer holding a pitchfork next to his daughter.

The man was actually Wood's dentist and the 'wife' the artist's sister Nan.

And while not entirely non-fiction, the comically unsettling portrait is perhaps America's most parodied ever.

So much so that the house that simply stands in its background has become a tourist attraction.

At least initially, that didn't bother Howard. She liked the rent, kept artificially low to make up for the nuisance rubberneckers, and wanted a place to start anew after becoming a widow at age 48.

She was inspired and then some, becoming known as the 'Pie Lady' for the impressive pastries she churned out in the historic home's kitchen. She also started a popular pie blog.

The tourist attraction is also a home: A woman named Beth Howard lived for fours years in the house, but moved out Monday

Just a regular home...almost: Howard had to keep the windows covered nearly all the time to avoid peeping-tom tourists

Pie Lady: Howard cooked thousands of pies in the famous home's kitchen and made a name for herself, and even wrote a bestselling cookbook, while living there

Homey: Howard managed to make a name for herself as a pie maker, cookbook author and public speaker while she lived in the 1882 home

She also wrote a bestselling cookbook while in the home. 

But she's now gone off to greener pastures, a room with a view of cows in an equally rural part of the state, to write a book she says will be 'a memoir of the misadventures of living in a masterpiece painting with snakes in the basement.'

Meanwhile, Jerome Thompson, the society's historic site administrator, said the group is weighing its options on what to do next.

They may rent it out again or they may offer an artist-in-residence program.

They may also allow the next-door visitors' center, which is run by the city and county, to use it. 

American Pie: Howard (with the pitchfork) moved into the home after becoming widowed at 48. She lived there four years and has now moved to a friend's farm, where she hopes to write a book about her time at the house
