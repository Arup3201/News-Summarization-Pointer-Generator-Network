A gang of thieves have been jailed for handling stolen rare antiques worth £5million.

The three men pleaded guilty to handling
several pieces of irreplaceable antique furniture earlier this year. They were sentenced on Friday at Leeds Crown Court.

Darren Webster, 46, from Leeds, was jailed for six years and six months.

Carl Rutter 46, from Wakefield, was jailed for six years and Brian Eaton, 69, from Tankersley, was jailed for four years.

The irreplaceable pieces of antique furniture, porcelain and objet d'art were stolen from Newby Hall and Sion Hill 
in North Yorkshire, Lotherton Hall, West Yorkshire, and Firle Place in 
Sussex in 2011.

They were taken by Graham Harkin - currently serving nine years in prison.

Police became aware of 
the trio's involvement in the raid shortly after carrying out a drugs raid at 
Webster's home in April 2011.

Stolen: A pair of Louis XVI bleu nouveau ground vases, pictured, valued at £950,000 were just some of the items Webster, Rutter and Eaton had possession of

Rare: A George III Pembroke Chippendale drop leaf table valued at £500,000 was also handled by the trio

Officers searched the property and recovered a computer memory stick and SIM card which contained photographs of stolen antiques.

Police then launched an operation which saw an undercover police officer approach Eaton pretending he wanted to store stolen cars. The officer then began to talk about buying stolen antiques.

The officer was told by Eaton that he knew someone who stored stolen antiques - but any pieces bought would have to be shipped abroad because they were so well known.

Eventually all three were arrested in September 2011.

Hoard: An Ebony Veneered Bracket Clock by Daniel Delander of London circa 1710, right, and a Meissen group of the Indiscreet Harlequin valued at £180,000, left, were also recovered

The recovered antiques included a 
£500,000 George III Pembroke Chippendale drop leaf table and a pair of 
Louis XVI bleu nouveau ground vases and bases known as 'The Firle Vases' 
valued at £950,000.

An ebony veneered bracket clock by Daniel Delander of London circa 1710 was also recovered as was a Meissen group of the Indiscreet Harlequin, valued at £180,000.

All items have now been returned.

Jailing them, Judge James Spencer said: 'The stolen goods were extremely valuable antique items. The burglaries were committed in order to steal those items and were therefore targeted.

'He (Harkin) could not have carried out those burglaries without some prospect of disposing of them. It is because of that that the real evil of handling exists.'

The valuables, known to be of significant and cultural historic value and worth a total of £5m were recovered by officers from the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU).

It marked the culmination of a year-long investigation carried out by the ROCU who were supported  by West Yorkshire Police and officers from the Regional Roads Crime Team, North Yorkshire Police and South Yorkshire Police.

Speaking of the case, Det Supt Steve Waite, Head of Regional Intelligence said: 'We were immensely pleased and proud back in September 2011 to have recovered these high value antiques which were described as true pieces of British heritage.'

Targeted: Sion Hill stately home in North Yorkshire, pictured, was also targeted by the gang
