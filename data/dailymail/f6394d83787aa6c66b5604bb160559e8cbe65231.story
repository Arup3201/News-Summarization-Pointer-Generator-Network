Stoke manager Mark Hughes has warned Southampton counterpart Ronald Koeman to expect a far rougher ride on Saturday compared to their recent stroll against Sunderland.

The Saints head into their latest Premier League clash with Stoke on a high after hammering the woeful Wearsiders 8-0 last Saturday.

On the back of a run of five wins in their last six league matches, Koeman's side are a heady third in the table and will no doubt be confident of adding Stoke to their recent list of scalps.

Hughes, though, has no doubt his side will give Southampton more of a run for their money, even though they were beaten 3-1 by Sunderland themselves just three weeks ago.

'It was an outstanding result,' said Hughes of Southampton's win over the Black Cats.

'It doesn't matter at what level you play. To beat another team 8-0 is an outstanding performance.

'We go there with them on an obvious high given the performance and result, but we're in a confident mood ourselves.

'We won last time out, so we'd like to think we'll make a better fist of it - should I suggest.

'We'll recognise the talent and ability they have in their squad, but we've plenty of that ourselves, so they know it will be a difficult game for them.

'It's up to us to make sure (the win over Sunderland) was a one-off performance and result, and is not something that will influence our game.'

Many experts have been surprised by what Southampton have achieved so far this season given the departure of manager Mauricio Pochettino over the summer to Tottenham along with the exit of a number of key players.

Koeman, however, has bought well in Hughes' eyes, with the likes of Graziano Pelle and Dusan Tadic in particular immediately taking to life in the Premier League.

'When things change in such a short space of time it's difficult because they lost their manager and they lost two or three key players who had been exceptional for them the year previously,' added Hughes.

'There was perhaps a fear if they didn't get the right players in, and the right manager, then there could be a difficulty.

'But in fairness they have not had the issue of being unable to go into the market and spend good money.

'They've had a decent amount of money to work with that has enabled them to get good quality into the building.

'After that, of course, you have the problem of getting the dynamic and balance right in the dressing room, but they seem to have done that, and that's the impressive thing.

'I'm sure they're very happy with how their season has gone because there was talk they would struggle - not a view I shared I have to say - but there is always that worry when you make changes.'

Back-to-back home wins - after starting the season with consecutive home defeats - have helped propel Stoke up to a respectable 10th in the table.

Hughes feels after the early-season blip the critics were too hasty to write off his team, adding: 'At the beginning of the year I think everybody's view was shaped very, very quickly.

'As a consequence of losing our first two home games people assumed we'd had a really poor start, which wasn't really the case.

'We've done okay, and now we've had back-to-back home wins which have really encouraged us, and we've been okay on our travels, probably better than we were this time last year.

'So we're quite happy with where we are at the moment.'

Hughes goes into the game at St Mary's without midfielder Glenn Whelan who has a fractured leg sustained on international duty, while full-back Phil Bardsley is doubtful with a back problem.
