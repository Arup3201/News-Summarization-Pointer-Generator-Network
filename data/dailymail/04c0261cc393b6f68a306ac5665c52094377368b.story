Arrest: Mike Doster was charged with domestic 
battery after the violent argument with his wife

A woman has died from head injuries days after her husband threw her off their jet-ski when she confronted him about seeing him engaging in a sex act with another man, police said.

Pamela Carter Doster, 45, passed away at hospital on Wednesday and authorities in Manatee County, Florida are now investigating the 'suspicious' incident, the Bradenton Herald reported.

On Sunday, her husband of two years, Mike Doster, 49, was arrested for domestic battery. The Tennessee man had called 911 and told dispatchers that she had 'jumped off the boat' and was unable to find her in the water.

Their drunken,
 violent argument on Sunday evening was sparked when Mrs Doster told her husband she had seen him engaging in a sex act with another man, the police report said.

She was eventually found naked on Passage Key, a nudist beach that is popular 
with swingers, and told police that her husband had thrown her into the water.

She claimed that she had been riding back to land on a jet ski when the argument became heated and he reached back and threw her off the water vehicle.

The report seen by Smoking Gun
 states that Doster threw his wife off the 
jet ski a total of four times and 'during the last time she was pulled off she hit 
her head against the side of the jet ski.'

'Suspicious': Authorities are looking into the death of Doster's wife after he allegedly pushed her off a jet ski multiple times on Sunday, causing her to hit her head. She died from head injuries on Wednesday

She refused to get back on the ski with him and stayed on the sandbar which rests under knee deep water.

Her
 husband tried to get her back on the jet ski but she flat out refused 
and eventually he rode away, leaving her there, the police report said.

When
 he reached the shore, he called 911 and informed rescue services she was 
out at sea.

Emergency workers were able to find her - wearing nothing but her life jacket - and noticed 
she had a 'bruise/bump' on her head, a bruise on her biceps, and a 
'large swollen area to her left hip area.'

Scene: The woman was found on the sandbar pictured just north of the tip of Santa Maria Island in Florida

Shore: After losing his wife in the water, he drove the jet ski to the shore, pictured, and called 911

She was transported to a local hospital for treatment, and she passed away on Wednesday,

Doster was arrested for domestic battery and was released on Tuesday after posting $5,000 bond.

Detectives are now asking for anyone who may have witnessed what happened to call Detective John Kenney at 941-747-3011, ext. 2216, or Crime Stoppers at 866-634-TIPS.
