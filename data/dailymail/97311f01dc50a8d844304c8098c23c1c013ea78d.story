The BBC’s chief cricket commentator 
has revealed how he offered to take his wife’s terminally ill former 
husband abroad to an assisted suicide clinic.

Test
 Match Special presenter Jonathan Agnew said he would accompany Brian 
Dodds to Dignitas in Switzerland after he was diagnosed with motor 
neurone disease.

Mr Agnew, 
53, said assisted suicide was an ‘extremely sensitive and complex’ moral
 issue but believed individuals should be able to choose to die if they 
wanted.

Life or death decision: Jonathan Agnew, 52, with his wife whose former husband Brian Dodds was seriously ill. Mr Agnew offered to accompany him to the Dignitas Clinic in Switzerland

‘It was a very short conversation with Brian,’ he said.

‘He just gave me a look and a nod of appreciation that I had made the offer. That was all.

‘I did it because I wanted to give him the choice and because I hope that one day, if I am ever in that situation, somebody will make the same offer to me.

‘No pressure, just knowing the possibility is there if I wanted it.’

Mr Agnew had enjoyed a good relationship with Leicester solicitor Mr Dodds, who lost his two-year battle with motor neurone disease in December 2005.

The commentator’s second wife Emma had two children with Mr Dodds – Charlotte, 23, and 19-year-old Thomas.

But the youngsters were able to remain close to their father thanks to efforts by the Agnews to include Mr Dodds in regular Sunday lunches and even family holidays.

Mr Agnew said his wife, a BBC journalist he married in 1996, may not have known about his conversation about assisted suicide with her former husband, but he believed she would have ‘felt the same way’ about it.

The former England and Leicestershire cricketer added: ‘I have no idea how I would respond.

‘Like anyone, while I am fit and healthy I will fight to my last breath for life. But if I was suffering with a terminal illness, who knows how I would feel or what I would want? 

‘It’s something that is unimaginable until it happens to you and that is why I believe it has to be for that individual to decide what he or she wants to do.

‘If someone you love and care about, 
and who is clearly ill and suffering as Brian was, and he knew it was 
only going to get worse, I felt it was the right thing that he at least 
knew I would help him.

'It’s so hard for people who have to frame legislation and make laws on this subject. It’s a minefield.

‘But until you’re in that situation yourself I think your views are irrelevant.’

More than 200 Britons have died at Dignitas since it was set up  in 1998.

Under
 guidelines issued by the Crown Prosecution Service in 2010, a person 
accompanying someone abroad to commit assisted suicide is unlikely to 
face the courts.

But the 
guidance says a prosecution is ‘more likely to be required’ if the 
victim lacked the capacity ‘to reach an informed decision to commit 
suicide’.

In deciding 
whether to take action, police must investigate whether a person was 
able to give their consent. A mainstay of Test Match Special on BBC 
Radio 4 Live, Mr Agnew last month encouraged his 240,000 Twitter 
followers to donate cash to his stepson’s money-raising climb of Mount 
Kilimanjaro for the Motor Neurone Disease Association.

Earlier
 this year he said he wanted to stand up for fathers in broken families 
after revealing how the end of his marriage to first wife Beverley 
affected his relationship with  his daughters.

He
 told BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs how his separation in 1993 after
 ten years of marriage left him sidelined and struggling to maintain 
closeness with his daughters Jennifer, now 27, and  24-year-old Rebecca.
