A couple who went missing on their wedding anniversary and were later found dead in a hotel room committed suicide, a medical examiner ruled.

The bodies of Dr Leslie Cargile, 53, and 58-year-old William Cargile were discovered in Galveston, Texas nearly a week after they disappeared in August. 

They died from drug overdoses after taking a lethal combination of barbiturates, opiates and other drugs, the Galveston County Medical Examiners Office said on Tuesday.

No suicide note was found with the couple, who have two adult sons, according to the Charlotte Observer.

In another bizarre twist, medical examiner Dr Stephen Pustilnik ruled that the couple died two days apart. Dr Cargile died two days after her husband.

Neither suffered from life-threatening illness which was an earlier motive put forward as a reason they took their own lives. Legal or financial problems have also been suggested but nothing has been confirmed.

The couple checked into Galveston's Holiday Inn on Sunday, August 19 and their bodies were found five days later by cleaners. The room was locked from the inside causing police to rule out foul play. 

They were last seen leaving their home in Lake Summit, Henderson on Saturday, August 18 - the weekend of their wedding anniversary.

They drove off in their Mercedes and 
checked into a Hilton hotel in Mobile, Alabama that day. They checked 
out of the hotel the following morning.

People became worried on Monday, 
August 20 when Dr Cargile didn't show up at her clinic to see patients. 
Following her death a few patients noted that the doctor had been acting
strangely in the weeks before her death.

The couple’s 24-year-old son Kenton Cargile, who attends the University of South Carolina, filed a missing persons report on August 22. 

After the couple disappeared, an extensive search was launched with helicopters flying over areas in western North Carolina.

As Leslie Cargile was the sole proprietor of her medical practice in Black Mountain, it was forced to close down when she vanished.
