Top Gear has allowed Google's Street View car onto its famous test track.

The track made famous by the Stig, Top Gear's test driver, has now been added to the Street View service.

However, Google's drivers were stunned to find their drive interrupted by a supercar driven by the Stig skidding past - and managing to get into almost every shot they took.

It has already added everything from Scott's hut in the Antarctic to the River Thames.

Ulf Spitzer, Street View Program Manager at Google, said: 'At Google, we’re used to life in the fast lane, so we were thrilled to ride alongside the infamous Stig and capture imagery of what has become a British — and indeed global — institution for automobile fans.'
