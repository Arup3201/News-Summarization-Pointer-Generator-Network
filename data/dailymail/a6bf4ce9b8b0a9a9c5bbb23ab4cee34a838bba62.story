Price of privacy: Actress Julie Gayet was only awarded £12,500 in damages from magazine Closer

The ‘secret’ mistress of Francois Hollande was today awarded the equivalent of just £12,500 after making a criminal complaint against the magazine which exposed their affair.

Julie Gayet, 41, a high profile TV actress, originally asked judges sitting in Nanterre, Paris for more than £40,000 in damages from Closer magazine for breaching her privacy.

The magazine made President Hollande a laughing stock in January when it published photographs of him leaving a Paris love nest on the back of a moped.

He wore a crash helmet to try and disguise his face, but was identified by his shoes and the VIP bodyguards surrounding him.

Mr Hollande took no action against Closer, but Ms Gayet was determined to take legal action.

Jean Ennochi, Ms Gayet’s lawyer, said the images sparked ‘a real hunt’ for his client, who was pursued everywhere by photographers.

But Delphine Pando, for Closer, said the magazine covered a security risk to the president which the public had a right to know about.

She also pointed out that Valerie Trierweiler, the 49-year-old ex first lady, only learnt about the affair thanks to Closer.

It prompted her to check into hospital for more than a week suffering from ‘stress’, and then she was effectively sacked by Mr Hollande.

Ms Gayet filed a criminal complaint against Closer for ‘undermining the intimacy of private life’.

As well as the £12,500, Ms Gayet wins a ‘condemnation’ against Closer which they will have to publish in their next edition.

President Hollande's affair with Miss Gayet was revealed by Close in January this year when it published photographs of him leaving a Paris love nest on the back of a moped

Earlier this month, Closer ran another story which said it 'smells like the end’ for the Gayet-Hollande relationship.

It said that Mr Hollande, who has never been married, is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with her.

They have been meeting in secret for up to two years, Closer revealed, but now everybody knows.

Now Mr Hollande is seeing more of Segolene Royal, the 60-year-old Socialist politician he dated for more than 20 years and had four children with.

Closer pointed to how Mr Hollande is now ‘all smiles, and feels free since the clarification of his relationship with Valerie Trierweiler’.

It noted how Ms Gayet has been promoting her career alone, attending the French Oscars, where she was nominated for a supporting actress award, and posing for photographs.
