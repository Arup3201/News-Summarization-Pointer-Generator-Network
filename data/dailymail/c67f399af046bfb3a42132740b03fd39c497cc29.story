An armour manufacturer has developed a whiteboard that doubles as a bulletproof shield, aimed at protecting children in the classroom.

Inventor George Tunis was driven to create the board in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut last year, in which 27 people were killed.

The boards, measuring 18 by 20 inches, can stop a bullet from a handheld gun fired at pointblank range.

Bulletproof: A bulletproof whiteboard has been developed by defence suppliers Hardwire for use in schools, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre

Protection: The boards, measuring 18 by 20 inches, can stop a bullet from a handheld gun fired at pointblank range without it ricocheting

They are also less dense than water, meaning the armour can float.

The inventor hopes the boards can initially operate as teaching tools, but will be able to cover the head and torso in emergency situations.

Referring to shooting incidents at schools, Mr Tunis, said: 'It's something I don't think any American can tolerate anymore, and we're in a position to do something about it.'

The CEO of company Hardwire, added: 'I was like: alright, let's take everything we got, see what we can throw at this problem, figure out an innovative solution.

The boards, which weigh 1.7kg, have three rubberised handles on the back, allowing it to be held in front of the body.

The white boards are similar to Hardwire's Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle technology, which is used to protect military convoys in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The armor
is created from polyethylene-based textile called 
Dyneema.

Mr Tunis said the boards could buy children and teachers time before the police arrive in possible emergency situations, acting as a last line of defence.

He said: 'As teachers are doing their daily lesson plans, it's in their hands. And if there's a crisis, it's in their hands.

'Teachers are not first responders, but sometimes they're thrust into that role.'

Raft: The company says the boards, which can be used to rush attackers, are also able to float as they are less dense than water

The inventor donated 90 of the products, valued at $20,000 (Â£12,600) to Worcester Preparatory School, where his children are schooled.

Headmaster Barry Tull told USA Today: The products he has provided for us, I have been able to (provide) widespread layered protection throughout all the buildings on our campus.

'I've had teachers say, every layer we add, it just makes people feel fundamentally a bit more secure.'
