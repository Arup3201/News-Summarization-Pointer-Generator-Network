Three cheers for Jose... the only manager who sees festive fixtures like a fan

Whoever grants Christmas wishes is really on the ball this year. It was December 20, following defeat by Manchester City, when Neil Warnock again voiced his desire to return to media work, so he could properly let loose on the failings of referees.

And now he can. Just nine days after blaming the officials for losing 3-0 to a team with no striker, Warnock is gone.

Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish heard one excuse too many, considered the direction of the club after a fall into the bottom three and Warnock became the Premier League’s first managerial casualty of the season. He can now rail against referees to his heart’s content — although whether BT Sport want an expert with Warnock’s record telling Arsene Wenger where he’s going wrong is another matter.

Warnock’s statistics as a manager in the Premier League or the old First Division read played 118, won 27. He has taken 110 points from a possible 354, at an average of 0.93 per game. That is a history of relegation form — an aggregate of 35.3 points a season.

Queens Park Rangers sacked him for fear of getting relegated, Sheffield United and Notts County stayed loyal and went down. Palace are not prepared to wait around to find out.

Perhaps the final straw came with Warnock’s comments after the Boxing Day defeat at home to Southampton. He blamed misfortune.

‘I thought they had a lot of luck last year,’ he said of Palace. ‘I don’t see us having the same luck this year.’

Neil Warnock claimed that Tony Pulis' (pictured) Palace were afforded a lot of luck last season

In reality, Palace had defensive organisation to gather them points, rather than a sprinkling of fairy dust

Parish said he slept on it before making the decision to jettison Warnock, and it may have been that comment swirling around in his head. Luck? If it was just about luck, it wouldn’t matter who the manager was. If all Palace had to do was wait for fortune to intervene then they wouldn’t need a manager at all.

Tony Pulis got lucky, poor old Neil Warnock didn’t. It is as if the two were interchangeable, as if all managers are without talent and merely blown by the wind. And Warnock would like this to be true, because then his aggregate of 0.93 points per game would be a random event, and in no way his responsibility.

It would be like those other times — Carlos Tevez and Rafael Benitez’s weakened Liverpool team, and another round of faceless, incompetent officials, who always seem to gang up on him at this level.

‘Quite a lot of luck went with them last year,’ Warnock added. ‘We must be due some now.’

Of course, if Warnock wants to believe his failures are in the hands of fate, that is his delusion — but to deny what Pulis achieved at Palace last season is plain wrong. He took over a club joint bottom with seven points from 12 games and propelled them to 11th in the table. Yes, there were occasions when matches were won on the break or against the run of play, but that was more down to defensive organisation than a sprinkling of fairy dust.

The fact is Palace averaged 0.58 points per game when Pulis arrived and 1.46 points during his reign. At that rate, had he been in charge for the season, the club would have finished ninth.

The incredible comeback to help deprive Liverpool of the league title stands out, but before that Palace went on a five-game winning run, defeating Chelsea, Cardiff City, Aston Villa, Everton and West Ham United.

That isn’t luck. Pulis’s defence wasn’t constructed by accident, either. Under him, Palace were tight. He lost 10 league games, but five by single-goal margins, and four by two-goal deficits to Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur.

Only Newcastle United gave Pulis’s Palace what might be termed a hiding — 3-0 on December 21.

Pulis ruled himself out of a return on Saturday, which is a pity as he is exactly what Palace need right now. His great strength is that he does not care what people think of him, or his football teams. He is unapologetic, unconcerned by his reviews. If nobody likes him, he doesn’t care.

Warnock likes to give that impression, but it isn’t true. Nobody who makes that many excuses has a thick skin. Warnock doesn’t like criticism. That’s why it is always the referee’s fault. That’s why it is all random, a matter of luck.

He did not do a particularly rotten job at Crystal Palace. They had lost two games before he took over — including one to a last-minute Aaron Ramsey goal away at Arsenal — and managed to secure wins at Everton and at home to Liverpool.

They were not adrift like Leicester City and only one win short of 15th place on the day he was sacked.

Yet the squad had improved from Pulis’s time but in defence, Palace looked increasingly poor. They had won a single game against teams in the bottom eight, and two vital players, Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie, will be missing for the best part of January, on international duty for Australia and DR Congo at the Asia Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations.

Warnock was staking his hopes on the January transfer window, but Palace did not wish to spend extravagantly to survive. So Parish turned the bedside light out, and awoke convinced he needed more.

He will be painted as a trigger-happy chairman, the first to crack — and nobody would say Palace’s path since the end of last season has been stable — but to judge Parish too harshly would be a mistake.

Perhaps, by sacking Warnock, he was merely trying to make his own luck.
