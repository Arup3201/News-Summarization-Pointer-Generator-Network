With her toned abs, endless legs and glowing skin, Kendall Jenner is one of the world's most in-demand models.

But,  looking as good as a Calvin Klein model is the result of a lot of dedication and gruelling training.

The 19-year-old clothes horse has revealed that a pumping playlist - with plenty of beats by her brother-in-law, Kanye West - is what motivates her.

Kendall Jenner has shared her favourite work-out playlist and running to the beats of her brother-in-law is what gets her through a gruelling session

Sharing her workout playlist with Vogue, Kendall revealed her five favourite endorphin-boosting songs to be: Kanye West's All Day, Big Sean's I Don't F**** With You, Drake's 0 To 100, Kanye West's Mercy and A$AP Ferg's Work. 

The man responsible for keeping Kendall in shape is Gunnar Peterson, a Beverly Hills-based personal trainer who has worked with Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey.

'I do whatever he tells me to do,' said Kendall of their four-times-a-week sessions. 'Some cardio, some muscle-building to tone myself up.

'I’ll run to a gym and get on the treadmill; I [also] do a lot of ab work and planking.'

When fashion month is in full swing, Kendall revealed she guzzles detox tea to keep herself in shape for the countless big-name shows she  appears in.

'I usually start my day off with a cup of detox tea,' the model and Kardashian offspring told E! News. 'I have like 12 cups a day.'

Kendall also divulged that she snacks on apples and keeps her energy up by eating 'a clean diet with loads of fruits, vegetables and lean proteins.'  

And somewhere between the gruelling days and star-studded evening soirees she attends, Kendall does try to make rest a priority.

'My beauty secret for fashion week is just getting a good amount of sleep,' she said. 'I feel like I at least need about seven hours, eight hours of sleep to function.'

In a statement made via Calvin Klein, Kendall said of her latest fashion foray: 'Modeling for Calvin Klein Jeans is really a dream come true.

'I’ve grown up wearing the brand and seeing the iconic advertising in magazines and on billboards featuring some of the world’s top supermodels. To now be a part of that legacy is truly an honor.'

Kendall - who has been busy in Paris modelling for everyone from Chanel to H&M - is already the face of Estée Lauder, a brand which also hailed her massive social media standing when announcing that they had signed her up as their newest campaign star. 

It's been a  busy few weeks for Kendall who, after modelling in numerous fashion week shows around the globe, has just this month debuted a new video campaign for Estee Lauder.
