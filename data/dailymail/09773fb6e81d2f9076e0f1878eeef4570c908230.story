A video shows the terrifying moment a furious motorcyclist went on the rampage with a knife, threatening to stab onlookers and slashing his own bike - all because he had been given a fine.

Police had stopped 37-year-old biker Emir Yilmaz in the Seyhan district of the province of Adana in southern Turkey because he was not wearing a crash helmet.

After pulling him over they decided to also check the bike, and discovered that it was not officially registered and therefore not authorised for use on the road.

The discovery meant that the police officers slapped him with a heavy fine, which sent him into a blind rage.

He pulled out a huge knife from inside his jacket, and then started kicking his own motorbike before stabbing it repeatedly in the seat.

He then ripped off his own shift and waved the knife around, seeming to indicate that he would stab anyone that came anywhere near him.

Despite being equipped with guns, police tackled the enraged man with batons and fists, and wrestled him to the ground.

He was disarmed and taken to the Çukurova State Hospital for treatment. He was later released on police bail pending trial. He will also still have to pay the fine.
