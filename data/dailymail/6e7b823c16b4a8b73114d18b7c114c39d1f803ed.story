Militant rail unions are set to create a nightmare for travellers over Christmas by staging a nationwide series of strikes.

Walkouts are planned across the holiday period, as families visit relatives, shoppers flock to Boxing Day sales and fans travel to major sporting events.

The strikes will hit CrossCountry trains from Penzance to Aberdeen, sleeper services between London and Scotland, the London Underground and the Newcastle Metro.

The stoppage on Boxing Day will disrupt London Underground services on a busy day in the capital, causing chaos for shoppers, sports fans and visitors

Passengers travelling home for Christmas will also be affected by nationwide RMT strikes

Services between Nottingham, Leicester
and Sheffield and London will also be affected as staff at signal boxes
controlling St Pancras international station take industrial action.

In one of the biggest disruptions, 
Tube drivers will stage three strikes, including one on Boxing Day, in a
row over Bank Holiday pay.

Members of the Aslef train drivers’ 
union will walk out for 24 hours on December 26, and again on January 18
and 25, causing chaos in the capital.

It will be the third successive Boxing
Day walkout by Tube drivers in a dispute over Bank Holiday pay which 
dates back to an agreement in 1992.

One rail executive told the Daily Mail: ‘Funny how these things always happen at Christmas.’

Members of the hard-line Aslef train-drivers' union will walk out for 24 hours on December 26

Rival union RMT, lead by General Secretary Bob Crow, are also planning a series of industrial strikes on CrossCountry trains

Aslef members voted by a ratio of 
nine to one in favour of strikes. Union general secretary Mick Whelan 
said: ‘This result shows the strength of feeling among our Tube driver 
members. We are seeking quite reasonable assurances – that working on 
this day will be voluntary and that those who do attend will be 
adequately compensated.

'It is beyond belief that management cannot make an offer that achieves these points. ’

London Underground’s chief operating officer Howard Collins said they had made ‘a very fair offer’ to resolve the dispute.

He added: ‘Unfortunately, this was not
accepted and the offer has now been withdrawn so that further options 
to resolve the issue can be explored with the union at [conciliation 
service] Acas.

‘London Underground has a 
long-standing agreement with all trade unions which covers working 
arrangements on Bank Holidays, including Boxing Day. However, we have 
shown good faith and tried to find ways forward.

‘Further industrial action will not 
achieve anything and I would urge Aslef leadership to work with us to 
resolve this dispute.'

Cleaners working for Churchill's, the contractors on Tyne and Wear Metro, are to hold a 72-hour strike over low pay starting at 10.30pm on Sunday

The RMT union is also planning action 
on Friday against CrossCountry – which carries 90,000 passengers a day. 
It is in dispute with the firm over what the union claims has been a 
‘comprehensive breakdown in industrial relations’ .

RMT general secretary Bob Crow said 
because of the ‘total collapse of industrial relations’, the ‘union has 
had no option but to ballot members for action and with a mandate 
secured we are pushing on with a 24-hour strike’.

The decision was condemned by Tory MP 
Priti Patel, who said: ‘This is a highly selfish act by RMT to call 
strikes when people are travelling across the country to see families 
and loved ones. The union should think again.’

In the North East, cleaners working 
for Churchill’s, the contractors, on Tyne and Wear Metro are to hold a 
72-hour strike over low pay starting at 10.30pm on Sunday.

In Scotland, RMT members working for 
ScotRail will on Friday hold the first of two 24-hour Christmas strikes 
over what the union says is ‘victimisation’ of one of its members. The 
second walkout is set to hit Christmas Eve services.

The union has planned the strike in support of former ticket inspector Scott Lewis, who was dismissed after an incident over the type of ticket used by a member of the public

Although the strikes will mainly 
affect services in Scotland, there will also be disruption to 
cross-border and sleeper services to London from the evening of December
23.

Passengers on CrossCountry trains 
face further strike action from Friday in a separate dispute involving 
on-board crew belonging to the RMT union.

CrossCountry runs 300 services to 120 
stations stretching from Manchester to Bournemouth, Aberdeen to 
Penzance, Cardiff to Nottingham and  Birmingham to Stansted Airport.

A Department for Transport spokesman 
said: ‘Any disruption to rail services over the Christmas break would be
very regrettable and we very much hope these disputes can be resolved 
so that passengers’ plans are not affected.’

CrossCountry’s managing director, Andy
Cooper, said: ‘It is regrettable that the RMT has made this 
announcement and caused unnecessary worry for customers while we are 
still working to resolve the remaining few issues.’
