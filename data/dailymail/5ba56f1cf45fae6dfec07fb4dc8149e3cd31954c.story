The hotel maid who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of rape rolled around on the floor hysterically crying when confronted about a web of lies she is said to have told to have him arrested.

As the Manhattan district attorney's 
office asked a judge to drop the sexual assault case against the 
former International Monetary Fund chief, it emerged accuser Nafissatou Diallo finally admitted to her deception, simply telling prosecutors: 'I wasn't under oath'. 

In a stunning turnaround, Strauss-Kahn is now almost certain to be released today in court, leaving him free to return to France and even run for the country's presidency.

Web of lies: Prosecutors filed a motion that included never-before-seen evidence about Nafissatou Diallo and her attempts to deceive investigators

The details about Miss Diallo's 
hysterical response to being confronted about her alleged lies come as 
New York prosecutors will today say they do
not have sufficient evidence to prove a hotel maid's claim that Mr 
Strauss-Kahn, 62, tried to rape her.

They are expected to state that Nafissatou Diallo has a history of lying that makes it impossible to ask a jury to believe her.

The $3,000 night hotel room Strauss-Kahn was staying in when he allegedly attacked Miss Diallo contained the semen of between four and seven other men, the report revealed.

Four stains were found on the carpet of the room at the Sofitel, three of which contained remnants of the semen of three different men.

The fourth stain on its own, bizarrely, contained DNA from three different men.

Investigators also found another stain on the wallpaper.

According to the recommendation for dismissal, the stains provided 'no evidence that any other person was present during the charged incident'.

Therefore, 'the circumstances under which the unidentified DNA was deposited are unrelated,' it found.

The development follows a meeting with Diallo and prosecutors about a 'bombshell' report with details of her alleged deception.

'In virtually every substantive interview with prosecutors, despite 
entreaties to simply be truthful, she has not been truthful, on matters 
great and small, many pertaining to her background and some relating to 
the circumstances of the incident itself,' the document states.

Judges immediately approve these kinds of requests, experts said.

'After an extensive investigation, it 
is clear that proof of two critical elements - force and lack of consent
- would rest solely on the testimony of the complaining witness at 
trial. Indeed, the case rises and falls on her testimony.' the report 
continued.

'Because we cannot credit the complainant's testimony beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot ask a jury to do so.'

Among evidence provided to prove Miss
Diallo's lies is a history of supposedly fraudulent statements she is 
said to have made under oath in the past, as well as conflicting 
accounts told to investigators, the media and in court.

'We have no confidence that the 
complainant would tell the truth on this issue if she were called as a 
witness at trial,' the report states.

When she told prosecutors she was 
gang raped by soldiers in Guinea, her country of birth, she 'laid her 
head face down on her arms on a table in front of her,' as she said her 
two-year-old daughter was pulled from her arms and thrown to the floor.

The hotel maid later admitted she had not been gang raped and that she had made up the story to help gain asylum to the U.S.

When confronted about another lie, she is said to have 'dropped to the floor, and physically rolled around while weeping.'

The document goes on to allege that 
she failed to disclose $60,000 in deposits made to her account 'by 
individuals in four different states'.

When she was asked about the money, 
she said it was from her fiancé Amara Tarawally - who has been convicted
of drug offences in Arizona after he tried to buy $36,500 of marijuana 
from undercover policemen.

While Miss Diallo insisted she had no intention to try cash in on her case against Strauss-Kahn,
the papers allege that 'very close in time to these statements, the 
complainant had a recorded conversation with her incarcerated fiancé, in
which the potential for financial recovery in relation to the May 14, 
2011 incident was mentioned.'

The report continues: 'Although there
is nothing wrong with seeking recovery from a defendant in a civil 
suit, the complainant's disavowal of any financial interest is relevant 
to her credibility.'

The sudden turnaround has led to speculation that Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist politician, could resume his campaign to succeed Nicolas Sarkozy as President of France next year.

Socialist Party chief Martine Aubry called it 'an immense relief' that prosecutors asked a judge to put an end to the case based on concerns about the accuser's credibility.

Mrs Aubry said on France-Info radio today: 'We were all waiting for this ... for him to finally be able to get out of this nightmare.'

The man who replaced Strauss-Khan as favourite for the Socialist Party presidential nomination yesterday said the former IMF chief's political comeback could be 'envisaged'.

Francois Hollande told France Inter Radio: 'A man with the abilities of Dominique Strauss-Kahn can be useful to his country in the months and years to come.'

Although Strauss-Kahn has missed the 
July deadline for potential Socialist candidates to declare, several 
party heavyweights have previously suggested it pushed back.

Outside the courthouse after the brief meeting, Miss Diallo's lawyer said the DA was making a mistake.

'Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus 
Vance has denied the right of a woman to get justice in a rape case. He 
has not only turned his back on this innocent victim, but he has also 
turned his back on the forensic, medical and other physical evidence in 
this case.'

Mr Strauss-Kahn's next court date is today at 11:30am.

Among
questions raised by prosecutors are about evidence of shady deposits in
her bank account, and personal dealings after the alleged attack.

The
district attorney's office also alleges that Miss Diallo, 32, lied 
about having consensual sex the night before the alleged assault that 
would explain redness her lawyers used as proof of Strauss-Kahn's guilt.

But the maid was not going down without a fight.

Miss Diallo's lawyer Kenneth Thompson petitioned the court Monday to drop the district attorney from the case.

Her
attorneys allege that the Manhattan District Attorney's office has 
bungled the Strauss-Kahn case, and even kicked Miss Diallo out of the 
office when one of their meetings grew particularly heated.

Thompson has charged that Assistant DA Joan Illuzzi-Orbon told them: 'No one with half a brain would ever put her on the stand.'

Mr Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as IMF 
chief after his arrest, could still face a civil claim filed by Miss 
Diallo’s lawyers, alleging he carried out a 'senseless attack' on her.

She has faced criticism for a series of magazine and television interviews before the case went to trial.

The maid has also been accused of lying about her past in Guinea and being involved with criminal elements.

Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyers, William 
Taylor and Benjamin Brafman, issued a statement saying that he and his 
family were grateful for the decision.

They
said: 'We have maintained from the beginning of this case that our 
client is innocent. We also maintained that there were many reasons to 
believe that Mr. Strauss-Kahn's accuser was not credible.'

There
has been widespread speculation that prosecutors would drop the case 
since late June when they revealed that Diallo had lied repeatedly in 
her statements and in her application for U.S. asylum, casting a shadow 
over her credibility.

Legal observers say the only way the case could be revived is if prosecutors turn up new evidence. That appears highly unlikely.

Commentators say the case-pitting a West African immigrant against a rich, white man who was in the running to become the next president of France could define the career of first-time prosecutor, Cyrus Vance Jr.

It
will also be remembered as one where Vance stood in front of the 
world's media to vouch for the integrity of the arrest before completing
the investigation and vetting the maid's credibility.

Observers
say it may not have been wise to defend the case on the courthouse 
steps or to rush it into the grand jury before an investigation.

But most applauded Vance for revealing that the alleged victim, who has spoken publicly about the case, lied on her asylum application about being gang-raped and has ties to a jailed drug dealer.

'He took all the right steps, even if he may not be happy where they took him,' prominent defence lawyer Paul Shechtman said.

Others, like radical defence lawyer and frequent Vance critic, Ron Kuby, were less supportive.

'It's an unmitigated disaster,' he said.

Diallo filed a civil claim against Strauss-Kahn last week in New York.

Her lawyers had been exploring a deal to scuttle the criminal case in exchange for a monetary settlement in the civil lawsuit, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Mr Strauss-Kahn had been seen as a leading contender in next year's French presidential election when Diallo accused him of sexual assault on May 14 at the Sofitel Hotel in New York, forcing him to resign as head of International Monetary Fund a few days later.
