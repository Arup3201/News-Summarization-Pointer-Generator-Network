It's fairly routine for music fans to leave a gig venue soaked - usually in beer or their own sweat.

But those who went along to a gig earlier this week in Brooklyn, New York, left the performance drenched in something very different altogether.

Unsuspecting fans at Swedish black metal band Watain's concert were shocked when the lead singer unleashed a skull-full of pig's blood onto the crowd.

This footage from the gig shows the frontman throwing the animal blood onto the crowd - using the skull of a dead goat.

The random act prompted a Mexican wave of 
vomiting from disgusted fans, while others were heard audibly screaming for help.

Some blood-soaked fans even reportedly burst into tears.

The band, whose members are devout devil worshippers, carried out the act as part of a Satanic ritual, according to website TMZ.

According to TMZ, the band said in interviews that it used real pig's blood for the stunt.

The website also reported that police received no complaints and the health department had not made any move to investigate the incident.

The gig was the only one the band is scheduled to play this summer.
