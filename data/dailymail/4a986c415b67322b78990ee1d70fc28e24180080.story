Brazil coach Dunga called up Robinho on Wednesday for the team's friendly matches against Argentina and Japan next month.

The striker had been left out of Dunga's team for friendlies earlier this month against Colombia and Ecuador but was later added to the squad after Hulk got injured.

Brazil will play Argentina on October 11th at the Bird's Nest in Beijing and Japan three days later in Singapore.

The match against Argentina is dubbed the Superclassic of the Americas, and is played on a yearly basis. Brazil won the match in both 2011 and 2012.

Last year's match was not played after a request from the Brazilian confederation. This is the first time the contest will be played in a single match instead of a two-leg series.

Only two players who were not in the squad earlier this month were called up this time - right back Mario Fernandes of CSKA Moscow and left back Dodo of Inter Milan.

Defender Thiago Silva, coming off injury, was not called up again.

'We know of his quality, at the right time he will be back,' Dunga said.

The matches in Asia will mark Brazil's third and fourth matches since Dunga's return to the helm of the national team after a disappointing World Cup under Luiz Felipe Scolari on home soil. 

Brazil finished fourth after a 7-1 loss to Germany in the semifinals and a 3-0 defeat against the Netherlands in the third-place match.

Brazil beat Colombia 1-0 and Ecuador by the same score earlier this month in friendlies in the United States.

Veteran AS Roma defender Maicon, who was released from the squad for reporting late to the team's hotel after the match against Colombia, was not in the list for next month's games. Dunga had said the doors would not be closed for Maicon despite the indiscipline issue.

Despite local pressure, Dunga picked players from teams competing in the quarterfinals of the Brazilian Cup, which will be played just a day after the Japan friendly.

'We understand the needs of the Brazilian clubs, but first we have to think about the national team,' Dunga said.

Goalkeepers: Jefferson (Botafogo), Rafael (Napoli)

Defenders: Mario Fernandes (CSKA Moscow), Dodo (Inter Milan), Danilo (Porto), Filipe Luis (Chelsea), David Luiz (Paris Saint-Germain), Marquinhos (Paris Saint-Germain), Gil (Corinthians), Miranda (Atletico Madrid)

Midfielders: Luiz Gustavo (Wolfsburg), Elias (Corinthians), Fernandinho (Manchester City), Ramires (Chelsea), Willian (Chelsea), Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool), Oscar (Chelsea), Ricardo Goulart (Cruzeiro)

Forwards: Everton Ribeiro (Cruzeiro), Robinho (Santos), Neymar (Barcelona), Diego Tardelli (Atletico Mineiro)
