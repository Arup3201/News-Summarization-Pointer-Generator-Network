Italy's highest court has confirmed an acquittal for former Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi on charges of abuse of office and paying for sex with
a minor, giving him a boost as he tries to hold on to his
role as a conservative leader.

At the first trial in 2013, Berlusconi, 78, was convicted
and sentenced to seven years in prison. But that ruling was
overturned by an appeals court in Milan that acquitted him last
year.

The Rome court, in a ruling that is now definitive, rejected
an appeal by Milan prosecutors to overturn the acquittal and to
hold a new trial.

Berlusconi was accused of paying for sex with former teenage
nightclub dancer Kharima El Mahroug, known by her stage name
'Ruby the Heartstealer', during 'bunga bunga' erotic parties at
his palatial home near Milan when he was prime minister in 2010.

He was also charged with abusing his authority to get El
Mahroug, who was 17 at the time, released from police custody
over unrelated theft accusations.

The trial was the most sensational Berlusconi faced. It
mesmerised Italy with its lurid accounts of sex parties. A
stream of would-be starlets on his TV channels took the stand as
witnesses.

Tuesday's ruling came at a time when the conservative leader
is struggling to hold together his Forza Italia party and
maintain a front-line role in Italian politics.

Last month Berlusconi pulled out of a pact with Prime
Minister Renzi over reform of Italy's voting system and
political apparatus, complaining that Renzi had excluded him
from the choice of who should become the new head of state.

On Tuesday Forza Italia voted against Renzi's political
reforms in the Chamber of Deputies, but 18 party deputies wrote
a public letter of dissent. They lamented a lack of internal
party democracy and said they had only obeyed Berlusconi's
instructions out of loyalty to their leader.

Forza Italia has steadily lost support since Berlusconi was
convicted for tax fraud in 2013. As a result of that sentence he
lost his seat in the Senate and was barred from holding any
public office.

According to most polls the party now has only 13 to 14 per cent
of the vote. That puts it behind Renzi's Democratic Party, the
anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-immigrant
Northern League whose leader Matteo Salvini seems to be
eclipsing Berlusconi as the prominent figure on the Italian
right.
