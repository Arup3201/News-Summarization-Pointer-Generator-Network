Officers were left bemused after they rushed to a pub garden to rescue what had been reported as a man trapped upside down in a field... but discovered it was in fact an entry in a village scarecrow competition.

The two officers were called to The Plough Pub, in Little Bourton, Oxfordshire, after a member of the public spotted the pair of legs sticking upside down in the ground.

But when officers arrived they discovered the 'emergency' was in fact a scarecrow.

'Emergency': Pub landlord Sam Harrison, 60, created the scarecrow, which was meant to be a man who had fallen down a molehill, for the local scarecrow competition

Pub landlord Sam Harrison, 60, had created the scarecrow, which was meant to depict a man who had fallen down a molehill, for the local scarecrow competition which was raising money for charity.

As well as the fake legs, Mr Harrison had also placed another molehill nearby with a giant mole sticking its head above the ground.

Mr Harrison admitted police were not amused with the prank when they responded to the emergency call last Sunday night.

He said: 'Our scarecrow was one of 14 made by villagers in Little Bourton for a competition to raise money for a cancer charity.

'It was a man fallen down a mole hole and a giant mole.

'The first I knew about the police being called was when someone said there were two officers in the car park. They said someone had reported a man fallen down a hole.'

Mistake: Police were called to reports of a man trapped upside down in a field after a member of the public spotted this scarecrow

Mr Harrison said the officers were 'not 
in the mood for laughing' and suggested he should move the scarecrow - 
which was placed near the pub car park overlooking the main road.

A spokeswoman for Thames Valley Police confirmed a member of the public had reported a man lying in a ditch outside the pub.

She said no action would be taken but officers would speak to the publican.

Other entries in the village competition included a drunkard tied to a lamppost without his boots.

But the winner was Pete Hainesâ€™ Crash Landing - a mother-in-law with a broomstick being rescued from a high hedge by a fireman.
