The computer hacker who betrayed alleged Wikileaks whistleblower Bradley Manning - who faces a lifetime in prison without parole - said he 'thinks about him every day'.

Adrian Lamo, 30, has been dubbed the 'world's most hated hacker' after he passed information about Manning - who today appears in court charged with illegally transferring U.S. state secrets to the website - to U.S. military intelligence.

He also said it would be to his 'lasting regret' if the man he described as an 'idealistic young man who could change the world for the better' was sent to prison for a long period.

He said: 'I think about him every day. The decision was not one I decided to make, but was thrust upon me.'

But, despite supporters of 23-year-old Manning fears that the soldier could be locked up for the rest of his life, he still insisted he had done the right thing.

He added: 'Had I done nothing, I would always have been left wondering whether the hundreds of thousands of documents that had been leaked to unknown third parties would end up costing lives, either directly or indirectly.'

Lamo made his comments last night, hours before the start of a pre-trial hearing in the prosecution of Manning in Fort Meade, Maryland.

It is alleged that Manning, a soldier, contacted Lamo on AOL instant messaging on May 21, 2010, using the name Bradass87.

He knew of Lamo because of his celebrity status in the hacking world. He had been prosecuted in 2003 for breaking into the New York Times network, and put on six months' house arrest.

During the internet chat, it is alleged that Manning asked: 'if you had free reign [sic] over classified networks for long periods of time, things that belonged in the public domain, what would you do?'

It is then claimed he told Lamo he had been downloading U.S. state secrets on to a CD, on which he had written Lady Gaga.

Wikileaks was set up in 2007 by journalist and computer programmer Julian Assange (pictured).

Mr Assange said he wanted to allow whistleblowers, journalists and activists to publish sensitive materials without fear of being identified.

His parents met at a demonstration against the Vietnam war. As a teenager, his mother rode into city hall on a horse to protest against the closing of pony trails.

Mr Assange has refused repeated requests by the U.S. intelligence agencies to meet them on 'neutral territory' to discuss his sources.

His website's complex setup is designed to ensure that information sent to it is anonymised before it is passed to the web servers.

Its servers are spread all over the world and do not keep logs, so governments and other organisations cannot trace where the information is being sent and received from.

Even so, WikiLeaks encourages donors of sensitive material to post the material to them on CDs, over encrypted internet connections or from net cafes.

They say this is so that even if WikiLeaks were infiltrated by a government intelligence agency, submitters could not be traced.

Assange burst into the public consciousness in April 2010 when WikiLeaks released Collateral Murder - video footage of a US air crew shooting Iraqi civilians in 2007.

But Assange recently revealed that the site is at risk of closure and is suspending its publishing operations to concentrate on fighting a financial blockade and raising new funds.

The stricken website is running on cash reserves after an 'arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade' was imposed by Bank of America, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Western union last December, said Assange.

Lamo passed the details of the conversation to the U.S. military and, on May 26, Manning was arrested while on duty at the Forward Operating Base Hammer outside Baghdad.

He had been working there as an intelligence officer.

Lamo was labelled a 'snitch' by hackers, but remained unrepentant. He said: 'I'm not a politician running for re-election. I don't need to be popular among the hacker community, and I most likely will never be liked in the hacker community.'

He said he thought long and hard about what to do but in the end believed Manning's wellbeing was not as important as the security of U.S. armed forces.

Manning is set to make his first public appearance today at the opening of his pre-trial hearing.

The secretive military base is, ironically, home to U.S. Cyber Command, the organisation whose mission includes protecting computer networks like the one Manning allegedly breached by illegally downloading huge numbers of classified documents in Iraq.

He is suspected of giving them to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy website that last year began publishing the materials.

The hearing is expected to last through the weekend and possibly beyond. It is intended to yield a recommendation to Army Major General Michael S Linnington, commander of the Military District of Washington, on whether Manning should be court-martialed.

Linnington could choose other courses, including applying an administrative punishment or dismissing some or all of the 22 counts against Manning.

If his case goes to trial and he is convicted, Manning could face life in prison. The government has said it would not seek the death penalty.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton yesterday called Manning's alleged actions damaging and unfortunate in remarks to reporters at the State Department.

She said: 'I think that in an age where so much information is flying through cyberspace, we all have to be aware of the fact that some information which is sensitive, which does affect the security of individuals and relationships, deserves to be protected and we will continue to take necessary steps to do so.'

The Manning case has led to a debate over the broader issue of whether the government's system for classifying and shielding information has grown so unwieldy that it is increasingly vulnerable to intrusions.

The New York University School of Law's Brennan Centre for Justice wrote in a recent report that the case points up a central problem with government secrets: 'There simply are too many of them.'

It added: 'As long as over-classification remains rampant, there will be those who see no harm in leaking classified information and/or who believe they are performing a public service by doing so - and the nation will continue to face the risk that such leaks will include secrets genuinely worth keeping.'

Absent from the Meade proceedings will be Julian Assange, who runs WikiLeaks from England. He is fighting in British courts to block a Swedish request that he be extradited to face trial over rape allegations.

A U.S. grand jury is weighing up whether to indict Assange on espionage charges, and WikiLeaks is straining under an American financial embargo that Assange says has starved it of revenue.

The materials Manning is accused of leaking include hundreds of thousands of sensitive items: Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, State Department cables and a classified military video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Iraq that killed 11 men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver.

At the time, Manning, a native of Crescent, Oklahoma, was a low-level intelligence analyst in Baghdad. Manning, who turns 24 tomorrow, was detained in Iraq in May 2010 and moved to a Marine Corps brig at Quantico, Virginia, in July.

Nine months later the Army sent him to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, after a series of claims by Manning of unlawful pretrial punishment.

When it filed formal charges against Manning in March 2011, the Army accused him of using unauthorized software on government computers to extract classified information, illegally download it and transmit the data for public release by what the Army termed 'the enemy'.

The first large publication of the documents by WikiLeaks in July 2010, some 77,000 military records on the war in Afghanistan, made global headlines. But the material provided only limited revelations, including unreported incidents of Afghan civilian killings as well as covert operations against Taliban figures.

In October 2010, WikiLeaks published a batch of nearly 400,000 documents that dated from early 2004 to Jan 2010.

They were written mostly by low-ranking officers in the field cataloguing thousands of battles with insurgents and roadside bomb attacks, plus equipment failures and shootings by civilian contractors. The documents did not alter the basic outlines of how the war was fought.

A month later, WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of State Department documents that revealed a hidden world of backstage international diplomacy. They divulged candid comments from world leaders and detailed occasional U.S. pressure tactics aimed at hot spots in Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea.
