Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, arrived in Canada tonight on a break-neck tour of the country.

The royal couple will visit three provinces, six towns and cities and undertake a staggering 41 engagements in just three days.

The heir to throne is notorious for the pace of his foreign trips on behalf of the UK government, packing more into them than any other member of the Royal Family.

Prince Charles and Camilla arrived at Robert L. Stanfield International Airport in Halifax yesterday

But this latest trip to Canada - his 17th to the country where his mother, the Queen, is still head of state - is challenging by even his standards.

Charles and Camilla arrived on a Canadian Air Force Jet in Halifax tonight where they were greeted at the international airport by dignitaries and then met with the Governor General, the monarch's representative in the country.

The Duchess was wearing a cream silk shirt-waister dress with a gold and black tweedy coat by one of her favourite designers, Fiona Clare.

She was carrying a black clutch bag given to her by a Canadian friend on her last visit to the country.

Camilla was presented with a bouquet of flowers by Grace Elizabeth Lenihan, three, and Molly Jane Lenihan, nine

The couple met with the Governor General His Excellency Mr David Johnston and his wife Mrs Sharon Johnston and exchanged polite small talk in front of the cameras for a few minutes.

Asked to stand in a different position for the official photocall, the prince said: 'This is like musical chairs.'

The Governor General added: 'You will accuse us of cruel and unusual punishment. '

Charles is later set to take part in a swearing in ceremony after being made a member of the Canadian Privy Council by the country's Prime Minister. The only other member to be awarded the honour is his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, in 1957.

Although Canada has welcomed four official visits by the Royal Family in four years - the Queen in 2010, then-newlyweds Prince William and Kate in 2011, and Charles and Camilla in 2012 - the Canadian secretary to the Queen says there is still a deep fascination with the royal family.

'There's a great deal of excitement and expectation about this royal tour,' says Kevin MacLeod, who has worked on some 20 royal tours since 1987.

Their official welcome to Canada, where Charles will make his first of four planned speeches, will take place Monday morning near the cenotaph outside Halifax City Hall. 

Later at the city's Public Gardens, Charles will plant an English oak tree - a tradition started 75 years ago by his grandfather, King George VI.

At historic Pier 21 and the Canadian Museum of Immigration, the couple will meet with war brides and veterans of the Second World War. 

They will also travel to the community of Pictou where they will learn about the province's Celtic roots, visit street stalls and watch a musical performance at Hector Quay.

That evening the couple will fly on to Prince Edward Island for a Victoria Day fireworks display.

Tuesday sees them spend the morning in Charlottetown, visiting the Legislative Chamber and attending a youth parliament debate.

The Prince of Wales will also be honoured with a medal recognising his contributions to Canada and deliver his second speech of the tour.

Charles and Camilla will tour the city's arts centre guided by an actress playing the region's most famous export -  Anne of Green Gables - before flying to Winnipeg.

On Wednesday, their last day in the country, the couple will undertake a staggering 16 engagements between them.

The highlight is set to be Charles feeding a polar bear named Hudson at the local zoo and learning about another famous regional bear - Winnie the Pooh.

The original Winnie was a female black bear who was bought as a small cub for $20 in Onatario by a Lt Harry Colebourn of The Fort Garry Horse, a Canadian Cavalry Regiment, en route to the Western Front during the First World War.

The bear was smuggled into Britain as the regiment's unofficial mascot with veterinarian Lt Colebourn naming her after his home city of Winnipeg.

Before leaving for France he decided to leave her at London Zoo where she become something of a local star and much admired, among others, by AA Milne's son, Christopher Robin.

Prince Charles was greeted by the Canadian Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, and Member of Parliament for Central Nova, the Honourable Peter MacKay

Christopher Robin subsequent changed the name of his own teddy from Edward Bear to Winnie the Pooh, providing the inspiration for his father's much loved books.

Charles and Camilla will leave Canada on Wednesday evening and fly back to the UK overnight.

Robert Finch, chairman of the Monarchist League of Canada, said he believed Charles still spoke to Canadians, both young and old.

'Things like the environment, bridging the gap between different religions, these are things that Canadians -- even young Canadians -- really gravitate toward, ' he said.
