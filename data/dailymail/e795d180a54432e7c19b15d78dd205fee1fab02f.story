The Pakistani teenager, who was shot by the Taliban after campaigning for women’s rights, declared herself an honorary Brummie today as she officially opened a new £188 million civic library.

Sixteen-year-old Malala Yousafzai, a vocal campaigner for girls’ education in Pakistan, was attacked by gunmen on a school bus near her former home in Pakistan in October.

The cold-blooded assassination attempt sparked worldwide condemnation. Today she declared that pens and books are 'weapons' that can defeat terrorism, in her speech outside the library.

Honorary Brummie: Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old who was shot by the Taliban after campaigning women's rights, gives an inspirational speech at the opening of the new £188 million library in Birmingham today

Addressing her 'fellow Brummies,' she was the guest of honour at the opening of the library of Birmingham, applauded by a 1,000-strong crowd.

She said: ‘It is
my dream that one day, great buildings like this one will exist in 
every corner of the world so every child can grow up with the 
opportunity to succeed.

‘The content of a book holds the power of education and it is with this power that we can shape our future and change lives.

‘There is no greater weapon than knowledge and no greater source of knowledge than the written word.’

Gravely wounded: Malala has made an amazing recovery since she was airlifted to Birmingham after the October attack where doctors treated her injuries caused by a bullet which grazed her brain

Having made an amazing recovery, Malala has become an inspirational education advocate for children around the world.

For her first public address since 
the attack she spoke at the UN’s youth assembly on her 16th birthday in 
July - declared Malala Day - saying that the assassin's bullet had tried
to silence her, but failed.

At the library opening Malala, who now 
attends Edgbaston High School for girls in Birmingham, placed her copy 
of The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho in the library - the last book to go on
the shelves.

Malala said: ‘Birmingham is very special for me because it is here that I found myself alive, seven days after I was shot.

‘It is now my second home, after my beloved Pakistan.’

Malala was airlifted to Birmingham 
soon after the attack and spent hours undergoing major surgery at the 
Queen Elizabeth Hospital where surgeons tried to repair the damage 
caused by a bullet which grazed her brain.

Since then she has set up the Malala Fund and presented U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with a petition signed by nearly 4 million people in support of 57 million children who are not able to go to school and demanding that world leaders fund new teachers, schools and books and end child labour, marriage and trafficking.

Home is where the heart is: Malala now lives in Birmingham which holds a special place in her heart 'because it is here that I found myself alive, seven days after I was shot,' she said

Speak up for the children: Malala used her seven-minute speech to call for peace and development in countries such as Pakistan, India and Afghanistan where children suffer from terrorism, poverty, child labour and child trafficking

She is also due to receive the 
International Children’s Peace Prize later this week in recognition of 
her dedication to children’s rights.

She used her seven-minute speech to call for peace and development in Nigeria, Syria and Somalia.

Malala said: ‘We must speak up for 
the children of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan who are suffering from 
terrorism, poverty, child labour and child trafficking.

‘Let us help them through our voice, action and charity.

'Let us help them to read books and go to school.

‘And let us not forget that even one book, one pen, one child and one teacher can change the world.’

The
library of Birmingham will house a collection of one million books and 
has 200 public access computers, theatres, an exhibition gallery and 
music rooms.

Birmingham City Council said the library will transform the city’s library services and become a major cultural destination.

Designed by Dutch architects Mecanoo, architect Francine Houben, library director Brian Gambles and deputy leader of the council Ian Ward were also present at the grand opening.

It marked four months of events coming up throughout the Library including workshops, performances, film, art, illustration, food and debate.
