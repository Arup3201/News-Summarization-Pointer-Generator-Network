The NSA is harvesting the online data of millions of airline passengers who use inflight WiFi across the U.S., a secret letter has revealed.

Gogo, the main supplier of WiFi to airlines in the U.S., are among a host of network providers that have been handing over information gleaned from air travellers' browsing history.

The news has enraged privacy campaigners who say the data exchange may be in violation of U.S. law.

'Scandalous': Gogo, the main supplier of WiFi to airlines in the U.S., are among a host of network providers that have been handing over information gleaned from air travellers' browsing history

A letter, leaked to Wired, Gogo admitted violating the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement
  Act (CALEA) - a 1994 wiretapping law that gave a backdoor to government agencies to monitor telecom and broadband activity.

But Gogo states in the letter that it added a raft of new measures to its service that made spying on users easier for the authorities.

'In designing its existing network, Gogo worked closely with law enforcement to incorporate functionalities and protections that would serve public safety and national security interests,' Gogo lawyer Karis Hastings wrote in the 2012 letter. '[Gogo] worked with federal agencies to reach agreement regarding a set of additional capabilities to accommodate law enforcement interests.'

He did not mention what the new measures were.

It
 comes months after a report in December revealed Panasonic Avionics - 
another airline WiFi provider - also added 'additional functionality' to
 connections at the behest of U.S. law enforcement.

Privacy campaigners have reacted angrily to the revelations.

'CALEA
 itself is a massive infringement on user’s rights,' Peter Eckersley of 
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Wired. 'Having ISP’s [now] that
 say that CALEA isn’t enough, we’re going to be even more intrusive in 
what we collect on people is, honestly, scandalous.'

Forced to hand over: It comes a month after the giants of the technology world, including Google, revealed for the first time how often they are ordered to turn over customer information for secret national security investigations

It comes a month after the giants of the 
technology world revealed for the first time how often they are ordered to turn over 
customer information for secret national security investigations.

Freed by a 
recent legal deal with government lawyers, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, LinkedIn 
and Tumblr provided expanded details and criticism of the
 government's handling of customers' Internet data in counter-terrorism 
and other intelligence-related probes.

The figures from 2012 and 2013 showed that companies, such as Google and Microsoft, were compelled by the government to provide information on as many as 10,000 customer accounts in a six-month period.

Yahoo complied with government requests for information on more than 40,000 accounts in the same period.

Those figures were released just a week after major tech firms announced a legal agreement with the Justice Department.

Judge Richard Leon, the presiding U.S. district judge in the case, ruled last December that the NSA program had constitutional flaws, but held off shutting the program down pending court appeals.

He has filed a lawsuit against the NSA and is pushing to have the case heard in the US Supreme Court.
