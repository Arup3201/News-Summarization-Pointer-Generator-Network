Tottenham Hotspur are braced for a High Court battle, which starts on Tuesday, against a local business standing in the way of  their proposed £400million redevelopment of White Hart Lane.

Archway Sheet Metal Works is beginning a two-day application before Mr Justice Dove, who revealed at a preliminary hearing that he is an Aston Villa fan.

The owners of Archway are challenging the confirmation of a compulsory purchase order that could force them to make way for the new 56,000-capacity stadium complex.

Archway Sheet Metal Works Ltd, based right next to White Hart Lane's North Stand, are the sole business fighting to prevent Tottenham obtaining the land they need to build a new 56,000-capacity stadium

Last November, a mystery fire gutted the premises near the North Stand at Tottenham's White Hart Lane ground in north London. The blaze prompted an investigation from the London Fire Brigade into the cause.

The owners said they had received 'bomb threats'.

Josif Josif, 46, who runs the family business, said at the time of the fire: 'People were calling us and threatening us and we were receiving bomb threats and that started a few months ago, but we don't know if that's got anything to do with it.'

The firm describes itself as a 'wonderfully old-fashioned family business' producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry.

The owners have been in a dispute with Spurs for the last decade over its redevelopment plans.

The club has planning permission for the new stadium it hopes to open for the 2018-19 season.

London Fire Brigade investigated the blaze at Archway, but the fire remains unexplained 

A Tottenham club spokesman said: 'We have already successfully and amicably relocated more than 70 businesses in the area to the satisfaction of all parties concerned and a number of these organisations continue to reside in the borough.

'Whilst we were able to accommodate all these other businesses' requests, in the instance of Archway, we have been unable to reach agreement over the period of the last seven years.'

Tottenham have been accused of misleading supporters in their ongoing dispute.

After seven years of negotiations failed to reach a conclusion, the club secured a compulsory purchase order last July forcing Archway to sell their land. But the company challenged the decision.

Directors of Archway, owned by the Josif Family, accused Tottenham of causing delay to the hearing.

Archway also claim the compulsory purchase order is 'unlawful and unfair' because Spurs and Haringey Council did not make information public about their plans before it was granted. 

A spokesman said: 'This information relates to secret discussions between the club and various public bodies concerning major changes to the club's scheme on which the case for compulsory purchase of our land was based.'

Tottenham were hoping they would be able to move into their new stadium by the start of the 2017-18 season, but believe the delay in construction due to Archway has made that highly unlikely.
