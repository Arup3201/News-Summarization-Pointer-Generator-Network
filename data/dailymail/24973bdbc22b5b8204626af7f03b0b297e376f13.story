A formerly bright student who suffered brain injuries in a car crash has been awarded $1.5 million in damages after a judge ruled that her injuries led to her working as a dominatrix.

Canadian Alissa Afonina. 23, aspired to be a filmmaker or actress and was in the top two per cent of her class before the August 2008 car crash, just before her final year of high school.

Witnesses say the Toyota Tacoma she was travelling in was speeding when it ran off a wet road into a ditch, ending up on its side near Salmon Arm, British Colombia.

The car was being driven by her mother's boyfriend at the time, Peter Jannson. Afonina's brother, Alexei, and mother, Alla, were also passengers. Both Afonina and her mother were injured.

When she returned to school Afonina showed no impulse control, had frequent outbursts, made sexually inappropriate comments, and found following through on tasks difficult.

She became isolated and dropped out of high school to finish 12th Grade at home. After briefly attending college, she began working as a dominatrix named Sasha Mizaree.

In court in January, Justice Joel Grove concluded that Jannson was driving too fast in the wet road conditions and was therefore negligent.

However, the case against Jannson centered not on whether Afonina’s brain injury was a result of the crash, but on whether it caused such a change in personality that she ended up working as a dominatrix, unable to hold down other employment.

Her lawyers argued that her decision to go into sex work showed a lack of ‘correct thinking’ and that her cognitive function had been impaired leading her to undertake unnecessary risks.

After the crash Afonina, 23,  showed no impulse control, would make sexually inappropriate comments and suffered from outbursts. She became isolated and eventually began working as a dominatrix

As a dominatrix Afonina is known as Sasha Mizaree and has a heavy presence on social media. A judge ruled that her injuries in the crash had directly led to her inability to pursue her original academic and career goals

Jannson’s lawyer argued that her work as a dominatrix proved she was able to organize herself and was able to maintain a modest level of income and employment.

Grove concluded that there was some truth in both arguments concerning the link between the accident and Afonina’s sex work.

He noted that as a dominatrix she was able to keep appointments, collect money, support herself and meet deadlines, all of which showed an ability to hold down a job.

However, he also noted that she had not minimized the risks associated with her work and had not implemented an alarm system or other safety measures, which is evidence of diminished judgment supporting a theory of frontal lobe damage.

Grove concluded that after the crash Afonina struggled to cope in a normal way, and the brain injury stopped her from succeeding at her academic and employment goals.

She is now only qualified and able to deal with entry level jobs for a few hours a day.

Without the injury, she could have completed college or university and been qualified for a better job.

Afonina was awarded $1.5 million in damages after a judge ruled that without her injuries she would not have struggled as she has and would have been able to complete college and get a job

Afonina was therefore awarded $825,000 for ‘future capacity loss’, $376,000 for the cost of future care, $300,000 for pain and suffering, and $23,000 for special damages, totaling $1.5 million.

A further claim for an inability to form relationships due to her isolation and sexual and general impulsivity – that she is ‘damaged goods’ – was dismissed due a lack of evidence.

Her mother, Alla, was also awarded $943,000 in damages for a mild traumatic brain injury sustained in the accident.

The former employee of British Columbia Housing will get $400,000 for future capacity loss, $195,000 for pain and suffering, $158,000 for past wage loss, $131,000 for cost of future care and $59,000 for special damages.
