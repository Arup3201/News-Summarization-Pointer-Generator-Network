New manager Tony Pulis watched on as West Brom earned a creditable draw away at West Ham on New Year's Day, and Sportsmail takes a look at his in-tray at Selhurst Park. 

Go back to basics

Too often this season West Brom have played pretty football that lacked any punch. Defensively, set pieces must be improved.

The Baggies need to make signings this month and Stoke striker Peter Crouch fits the bill 

Get fans on his side

Supporters were never on board with Alan Irvine’s appointment. Pulis will be given much greater slack so must harness that goodwill.

Buy to ensure safety

West Brom need pace in wide areas, a versatile full back, an imposing central midfielder and a striker of stature. Peter Crouch, who only has six months left on his Stoke deal, fits that bill.

Work with key staff

It will be interesting to see how he works with Terry Burton, technical director responsible for recruiting players. Decisions are needed over the coaching staff with David Kemp and Gerry Francis arriving.
