Princes William and Harry may have become the poster boys of the Royal family but it's their grandfather who is considered a God in a remote South Pacific island.

Prince Philip is  worshipped in the tiny village of Vanuatu, where villagers believe the Queen's 93-year-old husband descended from their spirit ancestors.

Villagers created the theory after meeting the Duke of Edinburgh on his visit there back in 1974 and this weekend saw Prince Philip's daughter, Princess Anne, return to Vanuatu.

Royal visit: Her Royal Highness The Princes Royal arrived in Vanuatu yesterday, where she was welcomed by delegates at the Duke of Edinburgh's Commonwealth Study Conference' s Pacific programme 

The 64-year-old Princess Royal, who was also on the trip forty years ago, yesterday landed in Vanuatu's capital Port Vila, where she will be spending five days working.

Princess Anne is president of Emerging Pacific Leaders Dialogue, which, according to its website, aims to strengthen the capacity of the region’s future leaders to manage challenges collaboratively, positively and creatively.

God: Sikor Natuan, the son of the local chief, holds two official portraits of Prince Philip in the remote village of Yaohnanen on Tanna in Vanuatu. For in the South Pacific village of Yaohnanen on Vanuatu's Tanna island,  Prince Philip is worshipped as a god

Praised: Sikor Natuan, the son of the local chief, holds a water damaged portrait of Prince Philip in a partially built monument to the British royal near the remote village of Yaohnanen on Tanna in Vanuatu

Local tribesmen believe he is the son of a mountain spirit and promised the people he would one day return to visit them - they hold a feast every year to celebrate his birthday and eagerly await his arrival.

He may not have ventured back to the island, which is 9,834 miles from London, but Prince Philip regularly sends letters and pictures to the tribesmen.

He even wrote a letter of condolence in 2009 when the tribe's leader, Chief Jack Naiva, passed away.

Meanwhile, it's been a busy few weeks for Anne, who arrived in Brisbane on Tuesday morning ahead of an international agricultural conference. 

The Princess Royal attended the 26th Royal Agricultural Society of the Commonwealth (RASC) at the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland (RNA).

Princess Anne touched down at Brisbane airport on Tuesday morning to attend the conference which aims to share ideas about agriculture, food, and the natural environments of members of the Commonwealth.

It runs for four days and HRH The Princess Royal will be attending for the entirety of the conference.

Busy bee: Princess Anne landed in the South Pacific island fresh from a visit to Australia. Here, she is seen in Burpengary, north of Brisbane, on Thursday

The RASC was founded in 1957 by The Duke of Edinburgh Prince Phillip, and he was President of the society for half a century. Princess Anne then took over the role.

The President of the RNA David Thomas is also the current vice-president of the RASC, and told the Brisbane Times his role means he has met the Princess Royal on many occasions.

'I think Princess Anne has always been a popular royal, she's very hard-working,' he told the publication.

'I think she's one of those people who are very approachable; my dealings with her have been completely delightful.' 

Royal duties:  Princess Anne inspects a horse as she visits the Riding for the Disabled Association in Brisbane. The Princess was in Brisbane as guest of honour at the 26th Royal Agricultural Society of the Commonwealth and visited charity groups during her four-day stay
