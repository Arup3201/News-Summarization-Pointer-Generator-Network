A 35-year-old woman has been confined within the walls of her home for 20 years, trapped by a painful condition which causes her skin to crack into agonising wounds at every movement.

Shabana Islam, from London, was forced to give up her career as a fashion designer and some days struggles to get out of bed.

The debilitating condition has yet to be diagnosed by doctors.

Specialists believe it could be chronic actin dermatitis - a condition where the skin becomes inflamed after being exposed to light. 

Shabana Islam, from London, has suffered an agonising undiagnosed skin condition for the last 20 years. She is pictured here before the devastating condition took hold 

The 35-year-old was forced to give up her career as a fashion designer and is largely confined to her house because of the excruciating pain. It causes her skin to crack into painful wounds with every movement, right

Specialists believe the condition may be aggravated by the light, but various treatments have failed to work

Miss Islam's skin is constantly dehydrated, and cracks into painful wounds and sores with every movement.

She covers her body in steroid cream and emollients - non-cosmetic moisturisers designed to combat dry skin - before bandaging her body up.

But despite her attempts to ease her pain, nothing has worked.

'It's like I'm being burned by hot flames and at the same time splinters of glass are being injected into my skin,' she said.

'Even when the cream has soaked in my body I often wake in the middle of the night to find the bandages fused to my skin.

Chronic actinic dermatitis is a rare condition that tends to affect men over the age of 50.

Those with the condition suffer itchy, red, inflamed and thickened dry skin, mainly in areas that have been exposed to sunlight or artificial light.

The rash develops in areas like the neck, upper chest, the backs of a person's hands.

The lesions are ususally red and inflamed, with a scale-like appearance.

A rash can appear after as little as 30 seconds in daylight and patients are even at risk on dull days and through glass windows.

Some will also react to artificial light sources.

'My skin is so hot to touch, I feel like a human reptile.  

'I can't even cry because my tears sting my eyes and face because of the cracks in my skin, it's relentless.'

For more than 20 years Miss Islam has lived with the condition which has driven her to drastic measures to relive herself of the constant agony she is in, she's even contemplated suicide.

She said: 'To take away the pain I would boil some water and pour it into a hot water bottle, which I then pressed against my skin. 

'I would even hold my arms up against hot radiators to ease the pain.

 'I could not take the pain my skin was causing, but I could tolerate the heat from the radiators and the burning it caused.

'The four walls of my home became a prison for me rather than a place where I can relax.' 

Despite the horrendous pain the 35-year-old goes through on a daily basis she has used her time trapped in her home to start up her charity; Skin Deep Behind the Mask (SDBM).

Her charity aims to help and support people with skin diseases and raise awareness of conditions unknown to people who don't suffer from the illnesses.

She said: 'SDBM was born out of my personal experience with my skin. It turned my world upside down and I've been robbed of my face, my identity, my independence and my time.

'SDBM's mission is "providing education, guidance and support to skin disease sufferers and carers alike".

'This means we aim to provide practical help to patients no matter what skin disease they have.

'For a lot of sufferers of skin disease their ailments are a way of life, something that has to be managed at every moment, of every day without a cure in sight. And their physical turmoil is just part of the suffering.'

She regularly smothers herself in steroid cream and emollients - designed to treat very dry skin - but her skin feels as though it is being burned by a hot flame or injected with glass splinters, she said
