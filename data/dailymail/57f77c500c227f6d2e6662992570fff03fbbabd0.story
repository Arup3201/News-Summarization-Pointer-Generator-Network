Burnley missed the chance to climb out of the bottom three as an unfortunate own goal from Kieran Trippier gave high-flying Swansea City the points.

Jack Cork's 64th minute shot struck Trippier and crept over the line before goalkeeper Tom Heaton could scramble it clear to make it a seventh game without a win for Sean Dyche's side.

The Clarets stayed in the relegation zone as a result, failing to capitalise on the team immediately above them, QPR, having a free Saturday.

Kieran Trippier's heat map sees plenty of forward-thinking play from the Burnley right-back, but he was unable to atone for his own goal as the Clarets lost 1-0. Click here for more stats, pitch maps and analysis in our brilliant MATCH ZONE

Ashley Barnes, criticised by Jose Mourinho last week for his 'criminal' tackle on Nemanja Matic was twice denied by excellent stops from Lukasz Fabianski while Burnley's appeals for a penalty against Federico Fernandez were waved away.

As expected, Dyche named Barnes in his starting line-up despite last weekend's furore in which the player was blamed by Jose Mourinho for the tackle that led to Matic being sent off for retaliation.

The huge cheer from Turf Moor's faithful when Barnes' name was read out over the tannoy before kick off showed clearly where their loyalties lie.

Aiming to build on a creditable draw at Stamford Bridge, Burnley made their traditional fast start at home with George Boyd warming the hands of Fabianski.

Swansea, missing playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson with a hamstring injury, were taken aback and unable to get their posession game going early on.

When Wayne Routledge tried to get down the left with an electric burst, Michael Keane showed commitment to the cause with a perfectly-timed tackle with his outstretched leg.

The first clear opportunity of the game fell to Barnes. He had a chance to become a real hero when a Danny Ings' shot deflected and spun into his path six yards out.

Barnes turned sharply and hit it first-time well enough, but credit has to go for Fabianski who spotted the danger and came out of his goal quickly enough to spread himself and make a block.

Michael Kightly then dribbled past two defenders before causing mayhem in the Swansea box as the hosts pressed purposefully for the first time around the half-hour mark.

Burnley have been spirited in their fight against relegation and haven't been cut adrift at the bottom as some people feared.

Nevertheless without a win in six games, this was the type of fixture they needed to take advantage of to promote their hopes of staying up.

Swansea's excellent season means they aren't in any danger of being sucked into the drop zone but their home form remains better than their results on the road, as suggested by last weekend's victory against Manchester United.

The lethargic Bafetimbi Gomis suddenly burst, or rather ambled into life, to test Tom Heaton with a low drive from 18 yards, followed by a run onto Jonjo Shelvey's pass that he skied over.

Swansea's tactical nous made it hard for Burnley who rarely showed the type of urgency you'd expect with less winnable fixtures coming up against Liverpool and Manchester City next.

Whether it was the publicity from the last week, even Barnes didn't seem to have the same dynamism and aggression as we've seen in other games.

Sean Dyche decided to do something about it by running to the edge of the pitch to kick the ball quickly back into play for a Burnley free-kick and maybe the urgency from the manager had an effect.

In Burnley's next attack, Kightly cut in from the left and hit a shot that bounced off Fabianski's chest. Kightly skewed the rebound back into a crowded six-yard box where it hit Swansea defender Federico Fernandez on the arm.

Burnley's players appealed loudly for a penalty but referee Jonathan Moss ruled it was unintentional. It was probably the right call but you have seen them given.

Barnes then controlled, turned and shot in one movement but was just wide after an hour.

As often happens in football, Burnley then capped their best period of the match by conceding in the cruellest circumstances.

From a corner, Heaton made a brilliant reflex save onto the crossbar from Jack Cork after Batefimbi Gomis' flick-on reached him at the far post.

Cork screwed the rebound into the six-yard box where it struck the unfortunate Trippier and diverted it past the goalkeeper whose despairing final touch was when the ball had crossed the line.

Dyche sent on a third striker Sam Vokes for winger Michael Kightly to try and salvage something from the game. And Fabianski frustrated Barnes again with a nice dive to his right to keep out the player's curler.

The former Arsenal goalkeeper then produced another outstanding stop to deny Vokes as Swansea climbed above West Ham into eighth place. Barnes' day lasted 87 minutes though he got sympathetic applause when he was replaced by Lukasz Jutkiewicz.
