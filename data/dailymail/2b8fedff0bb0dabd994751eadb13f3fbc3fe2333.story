Liverpool icon Steven Gerrard was announced as LA Galaxy's new signing on Wednesday and as a show of a respect to his boyhood club the former England captain stopped short of posing in the shirt of his new employers.

Supporters of the MLS side won't see the 34-year-old in a Galaxy jersey until July but EA Sports have given fans a quick glimpse of what Gerrard will look like in their colours.

Gerrard, who will end a 26-year association with Liverpool this summer, gave an interview to Galaxy TV on Wednesday where he insisted he was joining the California-based club to win trophies and cap off his fine career.

EA Sports have been quick to mock up a brief video of Gerrard in an Galaxy strip and show the Liverpool legend walking on to the pitch at the StubHub Center in California where he'll feature next season.

The EA Sports Instagram posted the video with the caption: '@EASportsFIFA has your first look at Steven Gerrard in an #LAGalaxy jersey. #StevieLAG.'

Gerrard claims he still has the hunger to succeed in football and  wants to add more titles to his trophy haul with the five-time MLS champions.

‘Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years,’ Gerrard told Galaxy TV. ‘I’m not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I’m going over there to win, and if I win and play well, then my life becomes more enjoyable.

‘I still feel like a player. I still feel like I can perform for a number of years, so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality — a team that is used to winning but also a team that’s got people that want to win in the future,' added Gerrard.

‘Having spoken to the manager Bruce Arena and also the people above him, they’re very aggressive and they want success.

‘That’s what I want. That’s how I want to finish my career, so they are the reasons I chose LA Galaxy. Their pursuing me was very aggressive. They basically told me what I wanted to hear. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team.’

Liverpool's current captain offered comfort for his adoring Anfield fans by insisting he wants to return to the club in the future. 

‘My message to Liverpool fans, I owe them a lot. I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season — and hopefully come back,' said Gerrard.

‘That’s the message: my relationship with Liverpool doesn’t end in the summer. In fact, it will never end.’ 

Gerrard has guaranteed LA Galaxy supporters that they can expect 100 per cent commitment
