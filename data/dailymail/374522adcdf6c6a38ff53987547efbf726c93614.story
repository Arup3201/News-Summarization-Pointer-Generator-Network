It's a local bar with a difference - the difference being its locality.

Welcome to Sandy's Bar, not at the end of the street but plonked right in the middle.

Just days ago this was part of The Sugar Bowl, summer hangout at Breezy Point's shore. Until it was ripped from its moorings by Hurricane Sandy and delivered to Gerritsen Beach, according to the people living there.

Incredible: The Sugar Bowl bar was swept for seven miles from the Breezy Point area of New York to this location in Gerritsen Beach

How it used to look: The Sugar Bowl in Breezy Point before its extraordinary journey. It turned up in Gerritsen Beach complete with tables and chairs, shot glasses and an impressively stocked bar

An incredible journey of around seven miles, across the bay and made even more remarkable by the fact that it turned up complete with tables and chairs, shot glasses and an impressively stocked bar.

With its clapboard walls and freshly painted window sills it looks like something straight out of The Wizard of Oz.

Little wonder one local speculated that it had been picked up by the wind and dropped where it sat on Madoc Street, Gerritsen Beach.

In fact one man knew exactly what had happened.

Astonishing: The Sugar Bowl floated into Gerritsen Beach on floodwaters, ending up in the middle of a street. Locals quickly renamed it 'Sandy's Bar'

Intact: The building's interior remained in remarkably good condition despite the extraordinary seven-mile journey

Venue: Gerritsen Beach resident Lawrence Lowey enjoys a beer in the abandoned bar which turned up in the middle of his street

Surprise: The residents of Gerritsen Beach could hardly believe their luck when a readily available supply of alcohol floated into their neighborhood

Refreshments: Some of the drinks found in the bar when the Sugar Bowl turned up in Gerritsen Beach

Relief: Residents of Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn, took the opportunity to have a break from the misery when they found the bar was fully stocked

Having a drink: Some of the revellers who enjoyed themselves when the Sugar Bowl washed up in Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn

Charlie Coppolino, 42, witnessed the arrival of the bar, thought to be a portion of The Sugar Bowl that wasn't flattened by the storm.

He said: 'I looked out my bedroom window and I saw what looked like a house just flying past. The water must have been five, six feet deep.

'I said, "Ma we're in trouble!' It came in Jamaica Bay and smashed my gazebo, through my gate, ran over a car and just went down the road about five miles an hour like a steamroller.'

Cycling up to where the bar sat askew
Lawrence Lowey, a resident of Gerritsen for 17 years joked, 'I told 
them to park my bar and look where they put it. You can't get the help.'

According
to resident Billy Gooch, 'All of us here, we'd had the panic we'd been 
through hell and the day after the storm we'd worked all day to save 
what we could.

Journey: This illustration shows how the bar was swept out into the water from its original location in Breezy Point before being washed up at Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn. Witnesses said it was travelling in floodwater up to six feet deep

Renamed: The revellers called the bar 'Sandy's Bar' after the superstorm and marked 'BYOB' on the side of it to instruct guests to bring their own bottles when the drink ran out...

...but the fun couldn't last forever, and the police ordered for the bar to be demolished and cleared away

Condemned: The digger reduces the venue to a pile of debris under police direction

Fun over: Partygoer Michael Farrell stands in front of the debris after police ordered for the bar to be demolished

'There's this bar - it's got Hennessy, Captain Morgans, 12 year old Maclallan, vodka and cases of Heineken...well what were we going to do? We had a party. We needed to let off steam.'

Once stocks ran out the bar, believed to be the Sugar Shack part of the Sugar Bowl bar, operated a strict Bring Your Own Bottle policy.

It turned out to be a last hoorah for the bar. By late afternoon the police had turned up.

Believing  they were there to remove a fibre glass boat they were initially utterly bemused by what they found.

But ultimately, and to boos from the good-natured locals, they called time on The Sugar Bowl/Sandy's Bar, breaking it up and clearing it away.

Destruction: The Breezy Point area of New York was devastated by Superstorm Sandy, with flooding and fires wrecking homes and businesses
