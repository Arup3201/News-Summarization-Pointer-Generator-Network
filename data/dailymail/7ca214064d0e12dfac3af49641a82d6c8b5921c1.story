After Black Friday saw people fighting in the aisles and having to be restrained by police as they clamoured for the latest deals, experts predict Britain's enthusiasm for a bargain will continue on Cyber Monday as it is likely to be the biggest shopping day of the year.

Around six million people are expected to log onto the internet tomorrow and spend around £650million on the latest pre-Christmas deals.

Retailers hope the success of Black Friday will continue, with some stores already notching up record sales - such as Amazon which sold 5.5m items on Friday at a rate of 64 purchases a second.

Online shoppers are expected to spend £650m on Cyber Monday after the popularity of Black Friday.

Cyber Monday is likely to be a calmer affair as it is confined to online purchases, but sales traditionally outstrip those of Black Friday. 

Recent years have seen online shopping figures consistently peaking on the first Monday in December, thought to be a combination of the last payday before Christmas falling on the previous Friday and a weekend spent browsing the shops before buying online.

Experian and the Interactive in Media Group (IMRG) predicts £649million will be spent during this year's Cyber Monday.

Amazon, will continue its success of the last week by releasing 'lightning deals' every 10 minutes on Monday on items such as Sennheiser Headphones, Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection on DVD and ruby jewellery.

This year the online retailer has hired 13,000 extra staff to deal with pre-Christmas demand and predicts this year's Cyber Monday could still outstrip Black Friday sales. 

Last year sales on Monday were higher than those on Black Friday. 

And as Amazon beat its 2013 Cyber Monday record of 4.1million on Friday this year, the retailer is hopeful for another record day.

A spokeswoman for Amazon said: 'Cyber Monday has been the biggest day of the year for internet retailers but the incredible success of Black Friday means that it will have to be a huge day for that to be the case this year. 

'We are ready for whatever the day brings with thousands of members of the Amazon team across the UK prepped and ready to pick, pack and deliver the millions of items that will be ordered.'

While some retailers such as Tesco remained tight-lipped about Cyber Monday deals, Amazon has already released some details of upcoming discounts. 

Stores are hoping the success of Black Friday, which led to record sales, will be repeated on Cyber Monday 

Dyson also confirmed there will be discounts of more than £100 on some hoovers.

Peak times for sales are forecast to be from 12pm until 2pm and for tablet users from 5pm to 6pm, likely to be during the journey home.

Vice President of EU Retail at Amazon, Xavier Garambois, said: 'Ever since we introduced Black Friday to the UK in 2010, sales have increased year on year but this year really has surpassed all of our expectations.'

John Lewis, which saw traffic to its website increase by 306 per cent between midnight and 8am on Monday, confirmed it will not be taking part in this year's Cyber Monday. A spokeswoman said Black Friday led to 'unprecedented levels of customer interest', with an iPad mini the most popular item.

During the morning the retailer sold a Nutribullet - the latest health craze that breaks down food into its most nutritious form - every 30 seconds. 

Stores are also likely to be spending the weekend preparing for the increased demand, as the websites of John Lewis, Argos and Tesco all temporarily crashed on Friday. Visitors to the Currys website were also left waiting up to an hour to see online deals.

Other stores will be continuing their Black Friday deals over the weekend and into Monday. ASOS  is offering 20 per cent off every purchase until midnight on Monday and Marks and Spencer is continuing a 30 per cent deal on some items. 

Amazon has employed 13,000 extra staff to deal with the pre-Christmas rush this year and after posting a record Black Friday, Cyber Monday sales could exceed this making its Peterborough warehouse even busier

However experts are also warning customers to watch out for deals that appear more attractive than they are - with some items on sale for cheaper prices months earlier. 

Jim McLauchlan, chief executive of price tracker website zeezaw.co.uk told the Sunday Times: 'Many Amazon offers are genuinely attractive bargains but other more general discounts, while pretty reasonable, could have been obtained for less in the least few months. It may not be the cheapest time to buy.' 

Cyber Monday will complete a successful weekend for the high street. On Saturday footfall in Oxford Street was seven per cent higher than the year before.

Jace TyrrelI, deputy chief executive of the New West End company, said: 'We're set to make £220 million across the West End for Friday, Saturday and Sunday - up between 5 to 10 per cent on last year.'

Cyber Monday will be a far quieter affair than Black Friday where fights broke out, police had to be called, and  a woman pinned herself to bag a cut-price 40" television at an Asda superstore in Wembley in London  

Mr Tyrrell predicted that while shoppers would be returning to work on Monday, they would continue shopping online.

The busiest shopping day on the high street often falls two days before Christmas Day, however Mr Tyrrell suggested this weekend would be the biggest trading weekend of the year. 

'The nature of shopping is gifting,' he said, 'Whereas as you get closer to Christmas it becomes closer to groceries.'

This year's Black Friday caused chaos on the high street - with police called to a Tesco store in Wigan and 11.37pm - before it had even opened - following reports that several hundred customers were trying to break down the doors. In Manchester another Tesco had to be closed 38 minutes after it opened because of customers fighting. 

Shoppers were predicted to have blown £1.1billion on the high street, working out at £2million per minute during the nine hours of trading, according to figures from the Centre for Retail Research.
