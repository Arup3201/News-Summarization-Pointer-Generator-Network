Tory peer Karren Brady has ruled out replacing Lord Sugar on the Apprentice – but hinted she could make a run to be London Mayor.

The West Ham chairman, who was elevated to the House of Lords by David Cameron last year, said she had 'no desire to do television' and would walk away from the hit BBC show whenever Lord Sugar leaves.

Baroness Brady said she was 'looking to do less television and more House of Lords – not the other way around'.

The celebrity businesswoman, who has been made the government's Small Business Ambassador, said she would consider running for London Mayor once West Ham had moved into their new stadium at the Olympic Park.

She told House magazine: 'I always say 'never say never'. If you'd asked me five years ago, would I be here in the House of Lords, I would have probably said 'No'.

'There are certain things you know as you get older you definitely don't want to do, like more television. But there are some things that you become more open to.'

She added: 'I spend a lot of time talking to Boris about it. I think Boris has been a fantastic Mayor. I think whoever does that job, it's the one job in politics that I think is very meaningful, that is like the CEO of a company.

'There are issues that need resolving and there's a lot of campaigning that needs to be done to promote London around the world.'

Asked if she also had ambitions to replace her friend Lord Sugar when he retires from The Apprentice, she replied: 'No… I have no desire to do television, I do it because I like Alan and we have a lot of fun together, and it's a really interesting show.

'But when he leaves, I leave. I'm looking to do less television and more House of Lords, not the other way around.'

Karren Brady, Lord Sugar and Nick Hewer are the stars of the hit TV show The Apprentice. Baroness Brady said she would leave the show when Lord Sugar stepped down

Asked if she will be known on the show as Baroness Brady or Lady Brady: 'I have no idea, I haven't even thought about it!'

She added: 'Alan is a friend, first and foremeost. And as he said friendship first, politics second.

'I was really pleased to have him with me on the day, we've been very close, we've known each other for 20 years, and of course other than doing the show we share a common interest in football. He said 'friendship first, politics second' and I said 'football third!'

She said the pair were 'like-minded on many things', but added: 'Obviously he supports Tottenham, I support West Ham, he's on the Labour side and I'm on the Conservative side, but friendship is important to us.'

Baroness Brady, who revealed that her first job paid just £8,000, laid into Ed Miliband – claiming the Labour leader, unlike Lord Sugar, 'doesn't understand business'.

She said: 'I think there's a real danger. Labour has shifted so to the Left that I think most businesspeople are very concerned about what will happen to their business and their growth if there's a Labour government.

'He doesn't understand business. He's never worked in business. Sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves, you have to understand what it takes to run a business.'
