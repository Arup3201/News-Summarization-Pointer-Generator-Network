A pensioner was ran over and killed by her own car as she stepped out to greet a friend, an inquest heard.

Rita Wilson had accidentally left her automatic blue Rover 75 in reverse gear when she climbed out of the vehicle in Weymouth, Dorset.

As the car started rolling backwards the 67-year-old mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of the brake sending it shooting backwards. 

The retired social worker's leg was severed after she was dragged across the car park, before the car finally pinned her against a wooden post.

Polly Clompus told an inquest into Mrs Wilson's death how they had arranged to meet at a seafront car park on July 16 this year, when the accident occurred.

'She got out of the car and waved and the car started to move slowly backwards,' she said.

'She tried to get back in but I was shocked when Rita and the car careered backwards at high speed out of the car park on to Commercial Road.

'I was in a state of shock.'

The car reportedly shot backwards smashing through wooden posts bordering the car park, dragging Mrs Wilson with it.

It then spun round and hit the posts again before finally coming to a stop when it hit another parked car. 

Mrs Wilson, a retired social worker from Weymouth, suffered multiple injuries.

She was airlifted to hospital in Southampton, Hampshire, but died 11 days later in hospital from brain injuries.

Dorset coroner Sheriff Payne recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest in Bournemouth.

Following the inquest Mrs Wilson's husband David paid tribute to her, describing her as 'a very caring, amicable, friendly person who worked her whole life to help others'.
