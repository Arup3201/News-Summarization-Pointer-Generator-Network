On the same day that the U.S. Department of State issued a global terrorism warning, a message suspected to be from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was posted on multiple jihadist web forums on Friday.

In the 14-minute audio message, the 62-year-old al-Zawahiri criticizes the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood-backed former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, blaming the military coup that resulted in his removal on Americans and 'Zionists.'

The crusaders, the seculars, the Americanized army, (former Egyptian President
Hosni) Mubarak's thugs and some members of Islamic parties with the 
support of Gulf money and American plotting, all agreed to topple 
Mohamed Morsy's government,' he said in the recording.

It's believed that this is the second recording al-Zawahiri has released in the last week.

CNN, which has listened to the message, has been unable to verify its authenticity. However, the network notes that 'the language used in the last posting resembles that in other messages 
attributed to al-Zawahiri in which he criticizes the treatment from 
various parties of Morsy, the former Muslim Brotherhood leader who last 
year became Egypt's first democratically elected president.'

The terrorist leader goes on to say that those behind Morsi's ouster want a 'secular, pro-American president to rule Egypt so they can continue with 
their plotting -- along with the Americans and Zionists -- to divide 
Egypt, just like what happened in Sudan.'

Al-Zawahiri is part of a distinguished Egyptian family who worked as a surgeon with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad when it tried to overthrow President Anwar Sadat. Following Sadat's 1981 assasination, al-Zawahiri was convicted of weapons charges,

In 1980, al-Zawahiri met Osama bin Laden and roughly 10 years later merged the Egyptian Islamic Jihad with bin Laden's al Qaeda.

In the other message released this week - believed to have been recorded on June 5 - al-Zawahiri slammed the U.S. for its treatment of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay military prison who had gone on hunger strike. Additionally, he urged Muslims to unite and fight.

Earlier Friday, the State Department issued what the Associated Press referred to as an 'extraordinary global travel warning' following an apparent terrorist threat.

The New York Times reports that the alert was issued after U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted communication between al Qaeda members discussing plans to launch attacks on U.S. targets in the Middle East.

'This was a lot more than the usual chatter,' one senior American official who had been briefed on the information told the paper.
