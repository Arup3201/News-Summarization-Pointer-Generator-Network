A council facing £26million in cuts has been accused of wasting money after it was revealed it spent £133,000 on tea and biscuits.

Islington Council in north London also spent £859,000 on taxis in 2013, a Freedom of Information request revealed.

The Labour-led authority is now under pressure to dramatically reduce its lavish spending on refreshments, which adds up to the equivalent of seven million tea bags and 429,000 packs of digestive biscuits over just three years.

The Freedom of Information request revealed spending by Islington council between 2010 and 2013.

Speaking of the council's outgoings, The TaxPayers' Alliance said 'residents expect their council tax to be spent on front-line services, not first-rate dining'.

Campaign director Robert Oxley added: 'This is an absolute fortune on council snacks at a time when many households struggle even to put food on the table.'

Under pressure: Catherine West, leader of Islington's Labour-run council, needs to save £26million in 2014

'Council chiefs need to slash the biscuit bill and end any unjustified provisions of free food,' he said. 

Islington Liberal Democrat leader Terry Stacy said he was 'gobsmacked' by news of the council's spending.

He said: 'Labour councillors obviously think they can do what they want and hope nobody notices...Either that or they are failing to keep a proper eye on spending.'

Mr Stacy added: 'When residents are facing the squeeze, how can they justify this? It seems they can find money for the things they want.'

In defence of the spending, Andy Hull, the council's executive member for finance, said most of the money spent on taxis has actually been to transport adults and children to schools and day centres.

Another council officer who did not want to be named said the £133,000 spent on refreshments and cookies since 2010 included the cost of public functions, including the annual Christmas dinner for pensioners and events to encourage foster carers.

He said: 'These figures show we are cutting the cash spent on refreshments every year, spending half as much as we did three years ago.'

'Last year, the council spent less than 20p per week on refreshments for each member of staff,' he added.

The council officer went on to say: 'Nonetheless, I am reminding colleagues to redouble their efforts to minimise such costs.'
