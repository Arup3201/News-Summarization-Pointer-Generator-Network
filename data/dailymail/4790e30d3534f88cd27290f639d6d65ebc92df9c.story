Villa fans had begun to call for an end to Paul Lambert’s reign when Christian Benteke sent a half-volley into the net a minute from time.

A year to the day since Sheffield United humbled Aston Villa in the third round, this match was on the verge of turning into another disaster.

Benteke’s strike silenced the protest at the end of a tepid encounter.

MoM: Sanchez

He collected a long pass from Carlos Sanchez and powered a shot from 20 yards to leave Blackpool goalkeeper Joe Lewis flapping helplessly.

It was only the 12th goal Villa fans have seen in 22 matches this season.

Lambert has introduced a style that relies on retaining possession and insisted the switch in tactics would ultimately produce results and questioned the protests. ‘When you have dominance of the ball, and are getting into great areas, then it’s strange to hear that,’ he said.

‘It’s different when your backs are against it and you’re not dominating the game.

‘They are entitled to say what they want, no problem.

‘I’ve had it my career at times but it doesn’t do the lads any good. The players have been great.

‘Don’t get me wrong, they’ll be hurt by it. But they enjoy the way they’re playing, especially since we’ve changed the style.’

The attendance was meagre, half-capacity at 21,837. The swathes of empty seats created a training-ground atmosphere that was replicated by training-ground football.

Lambert lined his side up in a 3-5-1-1 formation, with Ashley Westwood an unorthodox centre back. But the system was abandoned after 30 minutes, with Blackpool using Steve Davies as sole striker.

For long periods, Lee Clark’s team did what was required, holding firm to increase the anxiety around this stadium.

They nearly took the lead when Andrea Orlandi’s shot in the 37th minute deflected off Ciaran Clark and required Shay Given to re-adjust quickly to push it wide.

As in recent games, Benteke was looking a forlorn figure, but improved and forced Lewis to palm a fine drive onto the woodwork. 

Given was needed to tip a fierce shot from substitute Ishmael Miller over. With 60 seconds of normal time to play, Benteke struck.

‘I don’t think we deserved that,’ said Clark. ‘I can’t fault my team, I thought they were outstanding.’
