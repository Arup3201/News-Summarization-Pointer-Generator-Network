David Cameron's chances of winning significant EU reforms suffered a blow tonight after the new Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker rejected limits on immigration.

The nominee to be the next European Commission president met MEPs from Nigel Farage's eurosceptic group in the European Parliament ahead of his coronation next week.

Mr Juncker was asked directly if he would support any restrictions on free movement of workers within the EU. According to UKIP MEPs at the meeting, he replied: 'No.' Mr Juncker also raised the prospect of 'harmonising' tax rates - which would be fiercely resisted in Westminster. 

Jean-Claude Juncker was grilled by MEPs from Nigel Farage's group in the European Parliament tonight

William Dartmouth, a Ukip MEP for the South West of England, asked whether Mr Juncker agreed that free movement of people was a founding EU principle and ‘non-negotiable’.

He had barely finished asking the question, when Mr Juncker – who earlier joking asked chain-smoking Mr Farage if he could have one of his cigarettes – interjected to say ‘yes’.

Mr Farage said afterwards that the exchange would hasten Britain’s exit from Europe. 

The UKIP leader said: ‘We are very pleased that Mr Juncker chose to come and speak to the most Eurocritical group in the European Parliament which says something about him as a person.

‘We had a polite exchange of views but Mr Juncker made it absolutely clear that on the question of the free movement of peoples across the European Union, there was no question of any negotiation of that position. He showed himself to be completely out of touch by saying migration within the EU was a ‘marginal issue.’ In saying this, he will take the UK closer to the EU exit door.’

The new president faced down a question from an Italian MEP about Europe being undemocratic, claiming ‘there is no such thing as a European people’ and that direct democracy at a European level ‘does not work’.

However he did open the door to national governments taking further action to restrict migrants access to benefits saying that abuse of the system of free movement is ‘for nation states to tackle’.

Mr Juncker's remarks tonight came after he earlier insisted he would not block British attempts to claw back powers from Brussels - despite his public battle with Mr Cameron for the EU's top job last month.

The former Luxembourg Prime Minister insisted he wanted Britain to stay in the EU and said any proposals from Westminster would be 'taken under consideration'.

Mr Cameron, who has promised to offer an in-out referendum in 2017 after renegotiating Britain's relationship with Brussels.

The Prime Minister last month warned that keeping Britain in the EU had 'got harder' because of Mr Juncker.

He described Mr Juncker’s nomination as a 'bad day for the EU' and pledged to wage a 'long, tough fight' to reform Brussels before campaigning for the UK to remain in the EU in the in-out referendum he has promised to hold in 2017.

But, speaking to MEPs, Mr Juncker said that he is ready to begin talks with the UK to return 'competences' – EU jargon for powers – back to the UK.

In leaked remarks, published in the Telegraph, Mr Juncker told MEPs at a meeting in Brussels: 'I would like Britain to stay as an active constructive member of the European Union. If Britain puts forward a proposal it will be taken under consideration.

'I am not in principle saying that no kind of repatriation can take place. If Westminster wants to recover competences, OK. If the others agree it shall be done.'

Mr Juncker insisted he was not a 'federalist' - backing ever closer union between European states - and claimed there was not a single European people

The nominee to become the next European Commission chair was widely described in Westminster as an 'arch federalist' and Brussels insider who was not suitable for the EU's top job

Mr Juncker, who is expected to be confirmed as European commission president during a vote of MEPs on July 15, replacing Jose Manuel Barroso, added: 'I've never opposed the idea of a well-structured, well-organised, profoundly negotiated repatriation of competences from Brussels to national parliaments.

'I don't want the EU without Britain. Britain is an essential element of policy making in Europe because the British are a common sense and down-to-earth people.'

Mr Juncker also denied wanting a United States of Europe - despite being widely described in Parliament as an 'arch federalist.

The Brrussels insider denied being a federalist in favour of ever-closer EU, according to the Telegraph, telling MEPs: 'I don't think the European Union will become a state. I would fight against that.'

But Mr Juncker risked controversy after responding to an attack on Mr Cameron by a Labour MEP with a thumbs up gesture. Glenis Willmott criticised the Prime Minister's 'incompetent' attempt to block him, and added that Labour were working hard to unseat him in next year’s elections.
