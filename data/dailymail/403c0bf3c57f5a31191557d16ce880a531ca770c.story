Tesco has won the title of the season's best Easter egg for the second year running - but its luxury offering will set consumers back £25.

The Tesco Finest Medley of Flavoured Chocolate Easter Eggs scored 88 out of 100 in the annual Good Housekeeping magazine Easter Egg of the Year award.

Judges said they were 'wowed' by the 'beautifully presented' mix of white, milk and dark chocolate, and pieces of butterscotch, raspberry, hazelnut and coconut.

The 1kg (2.2lb) egg was also awarded the title of best for sharing.

Last year Tesco won with its own-label Chokablok American Dreamcake egg costing just £5.

The Waitrose Woodland Friends Hop The Frog won this year's children's category, scoring 81 out of 100, with judges describing the £5 hollow milk chocolate egg as 'delicious' and also awarding it the 'cuteness' award.

The Harrods Belgian Chocolate Lattice Egg, costing £29.95, won the best for grown-ups category, scoring 79 out of 100 for its 'beautifully simple yet elegant eye-catching design with creamy milk chocolate swirls'.

The Lindt Hello Cookies and Cream egg, priced at £9.99, won the best for teens category.

Good Housekeeping experts sampled 200 chocolate eggs costing between £1.25 and £45.

They also tested hot cross buns and Simnel cakes - a light fruit cake with two layers of almond paste or marzipan - judging that shoppers should still head to the supermarkets rather than to their upmarket rivals.

Tesco won the hot cross bun category with its Finest range priced at £1.70 for four, scoring 84 out of 100, while Aldi's 'generously fruited and good-sized' offering costing 99p was runner-up with a score of 78 out of 100 and Lidl's Rowan Hill buns at 79p for six were awarded best bargain buy.

All three brands beat 15 rivals including Harrods, Duchy Originals and Heston Blumenthal.

Good Housekeeping consumer director Caroline Bloor said: 'As our tests confirm, even if you are watching the budget, you don't need to compromise on taste.

'You're as likely to find a delicious Easter treat in the supermarket as you are in the luxury shops.'
