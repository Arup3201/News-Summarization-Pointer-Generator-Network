Andy Murray will be recommended for a knighthood for ending Britain’s 77-year wait for a Wimbledon men’s title, it emerged last night.

Downing Street sources indicated that the Government would pass his name to the Honours Committee because he had matched the achievement of cyclist Bradley Wiggins, who was knighted for winning the Tour de France – Britain’s first victory in the event’s 100-year history.

As it emerged the Queen had sent a private message of congratulations to the triumphant Scot, David Cameron further fuelled speculation Murray would be awarded a knighthood with the remark: 'I can't think of anyone who deserves one more.'

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘I 
can confirm that the Queen has sent a private message to Andy Murray 
following his Wimbledon victory.’

David Cameron, who watched the match from the Royal Box, is a tennis fan and is understood to support plans for ‘Sir Andy’. Sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, another keen tennis player, said he would also back a knighthood.

Murray was awarded an OBE in the New Year’s honours list for services to tennis after he won Olympic gold and triumphed at the US Open last October.

It is usual for public figures to wait for four years before being given a higher honour. But senior government sources said that was ‘not a hard and fast rule’.

A senior No 10 source said: ‘This is a major achievement. It’s the first British win for 77 years.

‘If you look at what happened with Bradley Wiggins, it’s a fairly safe bet that Andy Murray is going to be recommended for a knighthood.’

Andy Roddick, former world tennis No 1, tweeted: ‘Pretty sure @andy_murray might have to change his twitter name to @sirandymurray . . . Well played and deserved!’

The nomination will be passed to the Sports Honours Committee, which give its recommendations to the main Honours Committee, chaired by Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service.

A jubilant Mr Cameron – who was previously accused of cursing  British sporting performances – compared Murray’s achievement with Britain’s golden Olympic summer of 2012, which also saw knighthoods awarded to cycling team boss Sir Dave Brailsford and sailor Sir Ben Ainslie.

He said: ‘It was fantastic, it was an absolutely brilliant performance, an amazing day for Andy Murray but also an incredible day for British tennis and for Britain.

‘He was magnificent. In the Royal Box we were jumping up and down. It felt like the Olympics.’

The Prime Minister added: ‘It felt like one of those moments when the whole country is watching and there is just an amazing sportsman who’s dedicated his life and had wanted to win so badly and then just producing a performance that was exquisite.’

The French star spoke out as John Inverdale was forced to make a grovelling on-air apology for comparing her unfavourably with previous winner Maria Sharapova.

Inverdale told listeners on Radio Five Live: ‘Do you think Bartoli’s dad told her when she was little:

“You’re never going to be a looker – you’ll never be a Sharapova – so you have to be scrappy and fight?”’

Miss Bartoli, 28, said: ‘It doesn’t matter, honestly. I am not blonde, yes. That is a fact. Have I dreamt about having a model contract? No. I’m sorry.

‘But have I dreamed about winning Wimbledon? Absolutely, yes.’
