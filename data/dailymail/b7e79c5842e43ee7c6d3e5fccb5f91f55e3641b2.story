Manuel Pellegrini had a point when complaining about refereeing decisions which cost Manchester City in their 2-2 with Arsenal but Mark Clattenburg can’t be blamed for all of them. 

Those who don’t think video replays will help football should review the incident when Jack Wilshere handled the ball inside his own penalty area. 

Whilst some might try and argue that Wilshere’s arm is down by his side in a natural position, there is clear movement of it towards the ball in a deliberate way but Clattenburg and his colleagues had obstructed views and so just could not award the penalty that City deserved.

A video replay would have enabled them to award the penalty which City deserved and will help when a referee is unsighted.

The same could not be said of Danny Welbeck’s nudge on Vincent Kompany which meant the City captain didn’t get a clean header away and enabled Arsenal to rebuild their attack and feed the ball through for Alexis Sanchez to score.

I can only assume that Clattenburg was watching the area from where the cross came rather than the central area as he couldn’t have missed the nudge had he been looking.

The other complaints about a foul in the build up to Arsenal’s first goal and the fact that Clattenburg ‘had a very, very bad day’ revealed a deeper lying issue between the manager of the champions and England’s leading referee. 

Pelligrini has an issue with Clattenburg which goes back over a number of games. He truly believes that Clattenburg appears to be consistently going against his team. 

The Chilean is not a manager who plays mind games so this is a genuine belief which he must resolve in his mind and perhaps a meeting would be beneficial between the two.

Diego Costa is a superb centre forward who plays like an old fashioned ‘English’ target man. He is no lightweight ‘soft’ foreigner and was incorrectly cautioned in his first game for ‘diving’.

There was evidence of the more robust nature of Costa’s play when he pushed Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson away strongly after he was being held on the edge of the penalty area.

Perhaps he could have been cautioned had Kevin Friend been slavish to law, but there was nothing I saw to suggest he was fortunate not to be sent off and not being cautioned perhaps ‘levelled things up’ after his first caution at Burnley.

However Pellegrini must settle his issues with Clattenburg which go back a number of games prior to this clash taking place
