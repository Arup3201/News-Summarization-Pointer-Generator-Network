PSG midfielder Marco Verratti has predicted that his side will suffer a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Chelsea on Tuesday - because he is superstitious.

The two sides meet in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie in Paris, with Laurent Blanc's side having beaten the Blues 3-1 at the Parc des Princes in last season's quarter-finals.

Despite that result Verratti has avoided making a confident prediction, instead choosing to tip Jose Mourinho's men as comfortable winners.

Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas believes his side will leave Paris with a 2-1 win on Tuesday night

Asked who would win on Tuesday by Blues midfielder Cesc Fabregas in a new video for PUMA Football, Verratti said: 'Chelsea. I think they'll beat us 4-0!

'We Italians are very superstitious so before the game we prefer to predict that the opponents will win.'

Fabregas appears slightly perplexed by the Italy international's thinking but agrees to an extent, having predicted that his side would head into the second leg with a 2-1 advantage.

Verratti also questions Fabregas on Chelsea's most dangerous player but the former Barcelona man decides on a diplomatic answer.

'We have many good players so you'll have to be careful of everyone,' he added.
