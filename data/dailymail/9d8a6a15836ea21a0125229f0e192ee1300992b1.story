Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is hopeful Francis Coquelin and Aaron Ramsey will ease his midfield selection problems for Wednesday's clash against Queens Park Rangers.

Coquelin, who has been a revelation for the Gunners since his return from a loan spell at Charlton, fractured his nose in Sunday's win over Everton and is a doubt for the visit to Loftus Road.

Wenger feared the Frenchman may require surgery, but it is understood Coquelin has not been ruled out of the clash against Rangers and could still play in the London derby despite taking the hefty blow.

Gunners medical staff will make a late call on his availability and if Coquelin is selected, he'll be fitted for a protective mask to ensure no further damage is caused.

In addition, key midfielder Ramsey is set for a first team recall after recovering from a hamstring injury.

The Wales international hasn't played since February 10, limping off during the closing stages of Arsenal's 2-1 win over Leicester.

But Ramsey returned to training towards the end of last week and should be available for selection on Wednesday night.

His return to fitness means Arsenal could yet decide against risking Coquelin's nose against Chris Ramsey's side despite his growing importance to the first-team.
