Bill Montag, father of reality star Heidi Montag, has been abandoned by his family following his arrest in Colorado on Thursday night on charges of sexual abuse.

Nobody visited the 67-year-old on Sunday at Pitkin County Jail as it's feared his wife Terri has fled town, leaving concerned neighbors to take care of their two dogs.

A friend of the family told MailOnline that his 'life is in ruins' even if he's found innocent on charges of sexual assault on a child and incest.

Wearing an orange jumpsuit behind bars Bill cut a lonely figure during visitation, 10-11am, and was seen staring vacantly at the floor in a communal area while making a short phone call, a witness told MailOnline.

The source revealed how Bill is much older the other inmates – many of which spent free time in the morning pacing the corridors - and stands out like a sore thumb.

A friend of the family, Melody Morris, reveals she spoke to wife Terri Montag on Thursday night by text message.

Terri did not explain the situation but asked Melody to 'look after and feed my dogs,' without giving any indication how long for or when she plans to return.

Three days have passed and Terri is yet to contact Melody, a manager at a resource engineering company and lives opposite the Montag house, to tell her whereabouts or intentions to come home.

Melody, 52, said: 'His life is in ruins now. Even if he's proven innocent that dark cloud will still loom over him.

'Fled': Neighbors told MailOnline that Montag's wife, Terri Montag, has not been home for days

Melody Morris, who is dogsitting for Terri, told MailOnline reporter James Robertson, no idea where she is

'They are a lovely couple and amazing neighbors so nobody would have seen this coming. We're friends so I'm just concentrating on looking after the dogs.

'Terri sent me a message asking me to take care of things here, I haven't asked her about the case because it's so awkward.

'She hasn't told me where she is or when she'll be home – just that I'm in charge of making sure her dogs are fed and watered. She could be anywhere.

'It's a difficult situation for me to be in but nobody knows how they'll react until it happens to them. I'm just helping Terri.'

Terri's current location is unknown and all three family vehicles are parked on the driveway of their modest detached bungalow that backs on to a freeway in Glenwood Springs.

Bill's been suspended from his job after cops arrested him without incident at his place of employment, Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club.

The Aspen Police Department was notified by the FBI that Bill was skiing at Aspen Highlands, he was arrested when he returned to the ACSC offices, police said.

Bill was picked up on a failure to appear charge for three counts each of sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust and one charge of aggravated incest.

Records claim the abuse lasted for four years. The victim says the abuse began in 1993 and continued until 1998.

He is torn between two jails in the process of being extradited from Aspen to Arapho and is incarcerated without possibility of bail.

Shocked: According to Morris, the neighborhood was shocked by the news as the Montags are 'lovely'

Capt. Larry Etheridge of the Araphoe County Sheriff's office said: 'Allegations were brought forward by a woman, who is now an adult, who had alleged a sexual assault a little more than 15 years ago during a period of time when she was between 14 and 17.'

Etheridge said Bill 'denied it all' and 'did not admit guilt' but refused to go into further details regarding the investigation which launched in June.

According to NBC 9, 'Due to the statute of limitations, Montag is only eligible to be charged with crimes that occurred after July 1st 1996, when the victim would have been 16 years old.'

The victim bravely told she is coming forward after more than a decade in silence to protect other possible victims and young girls.

Neither Heidi or sister Holly are considered a victim in the case.

TMZ reports Heidi is certain her father with be exonerated and the woman making the allegations 'is determined to destroy the family,' and had previously stalked her and husband Spencer Pratt.

If convicted, he could face a prison of four to 12 years and a fine of up to $750,000.
