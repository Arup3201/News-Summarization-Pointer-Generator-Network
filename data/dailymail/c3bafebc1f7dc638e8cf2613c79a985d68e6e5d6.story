Food supplies to the UK could be blocked because defence cuts have left the nation with only 23 ships, it has been warned.

Vital shipping lanes around the world are being left vulnerable, according to Tory MP James Arbuthnot, chairman of the defence select committee.

The Royal Navy fleet is now just a quarter of the size it was when it defended the Falklands and has shrunk dramatically since the Second World War.

Mr Arbuthnot warned the UK now stockpiles almost no food or fuel, instead becoming dependent on regular supplies from overseas.

He warns that the country’s enemies could exploit the vulnerability to wreak havoc.

‘If someone wanted to close the Suez Canal, it would be really quite easy to do,’ he told The Sun.

‘I don't know how many days food or fuel we have but we will certainly find the price of everything going up quickly. If I wished ill to this country, it is what I would do.’

Mr Arbuthnot is standing down at the next election, and hopes to land a job in the defence industry.

He is quitting the select committee a year earlier, to prepare for a career outside politics.

The Royal Navy now has 23 battleships, including four assault ships, 6 type-45 destroyers and 13 type-23 frigates.

The figure is well down on the 73 available to launch the operation to defend the Falklands in 1982.

At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Britain had 272 ships, almost double the 150 on deployed during the First World War.

Mr Arbuthnot was a defence minister in John Major’s government, when the ‘idea of going below 50 serious ships was a major concern’, he said.

While modern warships are faster and better equipped than earlier fleets, there are fears that the UK is no unable to protect itself and its supply routes.

Mr Arbuthnot added: ‘Peace can turn to war with astonishing rapidity, as we saw in the annexation of Crimea.

‘If you have reduced your capability, then sooner or later you face the consequences.

‘Goods, food, fuel come to us by sea, much of it through the Suez Canal. We need to be able to protect our supply lines.

‘We have abolished all the warehouses we used to have and turned them into shi-shi flats.

‘And we have got no stocks of food or fuel or essential goods to last us for any reasonable length of time.’

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ‘Tough decisions had to be taken to deal with the deficit in the Defence budget, but at 2.4 per cent of GDP this year, planned UK spending remains well above the NATO target of 2 per cent.

‘The Royal Navy’s ability to project power and influence around the globe is evident with deployments of vessels to assist in the search for the missing Malaysian airliner; a Helicopter Carrier and Destroyer following the typhoon in the Philippines; while taking part in operations in counter-piracy, counter-narcotics and safeguarding Chemical Weapons being removed from Syria.

‘All this is being carried out while maintaining a large Naval presence in the Gulf, while naval vessels are also defending the Falkland Islands and maintaining our continuous-at-sea deterrent.

‘Construction of the first new Aircraft Carrier, the largest ship the Royal Navy has ever operated, is almost complete and the Navy will also operate state-of-the-art Type 45 Destroyers, new Type-26 Frigates, and seven new Astute Class submarines.’
