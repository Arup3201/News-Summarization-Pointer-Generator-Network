Fears are growing that terrorists locked up in Australia's most secure prison are communicating with people on the outside using code to try and plan more Jihadi activities. 

Prisoners at Goulburn ­Supermax in NSW are shockingly being given the chance to plot acts of terror from behind bars because they are allowed to write letters, make phone calls and have visits- even though they are in 'confinement'. 

The prison's AA classification was introduced especially for convicted terrorists like Mohammed Elomar, Mazen Touma and Faheem Lodhi in 2008.

Senior sources told the Sunday Telegraph of the security gaps at the prison and revealed that prisoners are able to send messages through other inmates called 'sweepers' who see the terrorists through work activity, such as maintenance and food ­delivery, and are then free to roam the prison.

The inmates are also allowed televisions, natural lighted and spacious cells. 

These men are considered to be so dangerous that they are escorted to court ­appearances and other appointments by guards armed with rocket launchers and machine guns while being supported by helicopters and armoured vehicles.

A high ranking former official said: 'They are kept in isolation but that means nothing in jail.   

'Messages are passed on in many ways. They are in segregation wings but can still communicate with the outside world. It is not hard because they still get ­visitation rights, which are their first outlet. 

'They can do it through mail, which they are allowed to send and ­receive. It is scrutinised and sent to ASIO, but there is still risk. 

'They also receive phone calls,' reports the Sunday Telegraph.

A corrective services Custody and Sentence Planning report says some AA inmates are recruiting others to terrorism while some are commanded to attempt escape. 

Prison sources said that terrorists can communicate ­jihadist messages by using a prepared code, while the ­report adds an al-Qaeda training manual outlining prison behaviour.

Category AA inmates are those who 'represent a special risk to national security' and 'should at all times be confined in special facilities within a ­secure physical barrier that includes towers or electronic surveillance equipment'.

Khaled Sharrouf became the face of Australian terrorism after a photo of his seven-year-old-son holding a severed head was posted on social media.

He was part of ­Australia’s 2005 terror plot and was ­jailed after stealing clocks and batteries from Big W. 

He used his brother’s passport to escape to Syria last year to fight for the Islamic State.

Sharrouf claimed on social media site Twitter to have received religious instruction from senior Al Qaeda leaders Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi and Abu Qatada. 

A Corrective Services told the Sunday Telegraph they wouldn't comment on the issue but that 'Australia has a high ­terror alert and we do not ­release information on our management of AA prisoners for security reasons.' 

Khaled Sharrouf is also wanted by the Australian Federal Police for alleged terrorist activities in the Middle East after he fled the country in December with Elomar on his brother's passport

Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a former Kings Cross bouncer who played a bit part in Underbelly, has also been identified as a senior military commander in the Islamic State. He recruited Elomar into ISIS
