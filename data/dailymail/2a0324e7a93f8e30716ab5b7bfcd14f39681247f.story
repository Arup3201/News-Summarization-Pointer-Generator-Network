Dozens of frustrated onlookers jumped into the surf to try to save a beached humpback whale after repeated attempts to rescue the 15-20 tonne mammal at Palm Cove had failed throughout the day.

Despite freezing temperatures and the high risk of danger, the footage on Channel Nine News shows the spectators deciding to take matters into their own hands by using their combined weight to move the eight-metre mammal as light was fading.

But the juvenile humpback whale will spend a second night on the shore after authorities informed the exasperated onlookers that it was too dangerous to continue the rescue mission in the dark.

The whale has experienced a distressing 24 hours after it washed up on the beach at 6.30pm on Tuesday night and was actually freed Wednesday afternoon but was soon washed onto the shore again.

The dedicated team was placed in a hairy situation earlier in the day when the whale rolled over on its back almost trapping the rescuers who quickly clambered out of the way.

There was then grave concerns that the mammal would drown before it eventually flipped back over as the relieved crowd cheered.

The tireless operation began at sunrise when a harness from Sea World was put around the whale and attached to a rescue boat but all three attempts to tow the heavy animal failed with the rope snapping every time.

As the tide went out half way through the day, the rescuers were left with no choice but to shelter the whale and keep it wet with buckets of water.

The rescue operation will resume at sunrise on Thursday.

This is the third whale to have beached in the past 24 hours with two rescued in NSW on Tuesday night during the whales' annual migration from Antarctica to their breeding grounds in the Great Barrier Reef.

A spate of humpback whales becoming beached on east coast beaches is a positive sign of the species' staggering recovery in Australia from almost extinction to nearly 50,000 in under 30 years, an expert has said.

If the population continues to rise at such a high rate there will soon be more whales on Australia's east coast than existed in the natural population before commercial whaling began.

Waiting game: Rescue teams made numerous attempts to rescue the whale but to no avail

There were just 200 humpback whales left alive on the east coast of Australia before the commercial whaling ban was introduced in 1986 - now they are flourishing, with 20,000 currently migrating along the shores.

'Australia's humpback whale population are increasing rapidly and are recovering as a result of the ban on commercial whaling,' Southern Cross University Professor Peter Harrison said.

'We have seen a 10 per cent increase in births this year and expect another 2000 whales to be added to the population,' he told MailOnline.

'Back then in the last century very few people were studying them but it's estimated before whaling there were 23-26,000 whales.

'At present we expect to exceed 30,000 whales on the east coast in the next decade,' Dr Harrison explained.

He added if you combine the west and east coast whale populations, Australia could now have around 50,000 humpback whales.

Another humpback whale was stranded on a sand bank at the Gold Coast earlier in the week, but finally managed to swim its way to freedom two days later

The huge population rise will eventually even out when the whales use up the ocean's natural resources.

A Sea World spokesman told Mailonline there is no 'real reason' why whales strand themselves but there are more wales around at the moment which is why the number of incidents has risen.

'There are 20,000 whales on the Gold Coast in this migration,' he said.

'As for why some are stranded there is no real reason, it all depends on the whales individual behaviour.'

A resident alerted authorities about the latest beached whale about 7pm on Tuesday night, after spotting it near the Palm Beach shoreline.

'It's pretty dangerous. This animal is probably around 15 to 20 tonne. Once the tide starts to come in, which it's doing now, you can't really get close to the animal because it could roll, it could lift it's tail,' Sea World spokesman Trevor Long told the ABC.

'So we'd ask that no-one goes down there and tries to get close to the animal.'

Sea World staff are involved in Wednesday's Queensland rescue effort, and hope to use a harness to tow it back out to sea.

'Currently the tide is against us, we are waiting for this afternoon to free it,' a Sea World spokesperson told MailOnline.

A second distressed humpback whale was trapped in fishing nets for more than eight hours at The Pass in Byron Bay on Tuesday.

The whale reportedly had a rope wrapped around its dorsal fin and tail, and was spotted at first light on Tuesday morning.

New South Wales Parks and Wildlife service kept and eye on the whale early in the day and in a joint effort with Queensland Fisheries officers managed to free the animal just before 4pm.

Also on Tuesday, a third whale was freed off NSW on the far south coast in Narooma.

The migration period runs from July until October when the whales make the return journey to their southern feasting grounds.

The International Whale Commission banned commercial whaling in 1986 to conserve depleted species

Only last weekend two groups of humpback whales were spotted heading north a few hundred metres of Bluff Rock near Yeppoon.
