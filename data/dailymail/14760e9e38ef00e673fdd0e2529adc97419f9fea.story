The sister of a rising rugby star killed with his father and brother in a slurry tank accident has been released from hospital.

Emma Spence, the sister of Ulster Rugby’s Nevin Spence, dived into the manure container, on the family farm in Hillsborough, Co Down, in a bid to help her father and two brothers after they fell in.

But all four were overcome by the poisonous fumes and were unconscious by the time rescuers arrived to pull them out.

Ms Spence, an acclaimed artist, was 
discharged from Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital last night as relatives revealed that the three
 men died trying to save each other.

Nevin, 22, who was tipped as a future 
international, died along with his father Noel, 52, and brother Graham,
 30, who also went into the tank on the family farm at around 6pm on Saturday night.

A book of condolence is to be opened today at Ulster Rugby’s Ravenhill ground in Belfast, already the site of floral tributes, while the team’s RaboDirect PRO12 game on Friday in Italy against Zebre looks set to be postponed.

Ulster Rugby chief executive Shane Logan said: 'It will almost certainly be postponed.'

Funeral arrangements have yet to be finalised.

There is widespread shock at the devastating blow to the remaining family members, Essie Spence and her daughter, Laura.

Last night the grieving relatives said: 'The families of Noel, Graham and Nevin Spence are trying very hard to come to terms with their tragic loss.

'The three men were very close to each other in life, and that love was expressed in their final moments trying to help one another.'

They added: 'The family is being supported and comforted by other family members, friends and neighbours.

'Arrangements for a thanksgiving service for the three are currently under way and details will appear in the press in due course.'

Emergency: Rescue teams were called to the farm shortly after 6pm on Saturday

Rescue effort: Firefighters attend the farm near Hillsborough, Co. Down, where the tragedy happened

The tragedy is thought to have occurred after Nevin’s father Noel went into the tank to try to retrieve the family dog.

When they realised he was in trouble, 
his three children tried to pull their father out, but were quickly 
overcome by fumes from the slurry, a combination of cow manure and water
 which is stored in vast tanks until it is ready to be used as 
fertiliser.

Firefighters were called to the family
 farm, outside Hillsborough in County Down, Northern Ireland, shortly 
after 6pm on Saturday.

Wearing masks to protect themselves 
against the fumes, they dived into the tank and managed to pull all four
 out unconscious but alive.

However, two of the men were 
pronounced dead at the scene while the third responded to treatment but 
died shortly after arriving at hospital.

Disbelief: Fans left tributes at the Ulster rugby ground as they tried to come to terms with the deaths

Last night sports stars, friends and 
colleagues paid tribute to Nevin, who played professional rugby union 
for Ulster, and offered their condolences to his mother, Essie, 61, and 
other sister, Laura, 26.

The Health and Safety Executive of Northern Ireland confirmed it was investigating the deaths.

Three other people have died on Northern Ireland farms from slurry gas over the past ten years.

Slurry pits emit poisonous gases such as hydrogen sulphide and ammonia, so can be dangerous if not ventilated properly.

The former, a poison which attacks the
 nervous system, is particularly dangerous as it disables the sense of 
smell – meaning the victim cannot sense how concentrated it is.

Named Young Player of the Year at the 
Irish Rugby Union Players’ Association Awards last year, Nevin was a 
member of the Ulster Rugby squad that reached the European Heineken Cup 
final last season.

He could play on the wing or as a centre and was considered a future Ireland international.

The committed Christian played for Ulster Ravens, Ulster’s second team, against Munster A on Friday.

He had represented Ireland at under-20
 level and was called to the Ireland training squad for the Six Nations 
last year. In May he was selected for the Ireland squad ahead of a match
 against the Barbarians, a touring team made up of top players from 
across the world.

At Ulster’s home stadium of Ravenhill, in Belfast, floral tributes were laid and his former colleagues were visibly shaken.

The club’s chief executive, Shane 
Logan, said Nevin was ‘a man of absolute integrity, complete 
determination, great humility, a fine team player, and an all-round 
exceptional individual’, adding: ‘I am deeply saddened by this tragic 
news.

Rugby.’

Promising: Nevin Spence had a bright future ahead of him as a professional rugby player

Former Ulster team-mate Ian Humphreys 
said on Twitter: ‘Devastated to hear the news about Nevin Spence and his
 brother and dad. Prayers with all his family. RIP Nev, you’ll never be 
forgotten.’

Irish Rugby Football Union president 
Billy Glynn said Nevin was an ‘outstanding’ young player and the game 
had been ‘robbed’ of a very talented young man.

Other Northern Ireland sports stars also paid tribute.

Former world champion boxer Barry McGuigan tweeted: ‘My deepest heartfelt sympathy to his family.’

Rory McIlroy, the world’s No.1 golfer,
 wrote on Twitter: ‘Just heard the tragic news of Nevin Spence and his 
family. Makes you cherish every day you have on this Earth.’

In a joint statement, Northern 
Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson and deputy First Minister Martin
 McGuinness said the accident was ‘a terrible reminder to us all of the 
dangers of farming life’.

They added: ‘Nevin was a rising star of local rugby and... his untimely death is a blow for the game in the province.’

Harry Sinclair, president of the 
Ulster Farmers’ Union, said: ‘On behalf of all our members, I would like
 to extend our deepest sympathies to the family involved.’
