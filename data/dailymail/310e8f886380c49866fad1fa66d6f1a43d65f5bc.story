More than 200 people were safely evacuated from an American Airlines plane that landed at New York City's Kennedy Airport  on Sunday afternoon following a bomb scare.

Flight AA67 from Barcelona, Spain, landed and was taken to a specially designated - and remote - hanger just after noon.

Firefighters and PAPD K-9 units conducted a thorough search of the Boeing 767 and the FDNY tweeted two hours later that the incident was under control and no bomb had been found on board.

Once the plane had safely landed, passengers were allowed to take their carry-on luggage and they were directed them to a grassy area on the side of the runway to await buses to take them to the terminal

The bomb threat was made on Sunday morning about an American Airlines flight landing at JFK from Barcelona that was searched by the bomb squad on arrival

Emergency services were placed on standby and twenty-five units and 105 firefighters responded to the airport.

All 200 passengers and nine crew were safely evacuated off the plane without injury. 

The incident isn't believed to have any impact on other flights at the airport and the FBI has been notified.

Joe Pentangelo with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police said all is now clear after the bomb threat.

'It was apparently a telephone bomb threat,' said Pentangelo and authorities have begun investigating where the call came from.

One passenger told the New York Times that the plane landed early, but instead of heading to a gate it was taxied away from the terminal and then stopped without explanation.

Eventually a member of the crew announced via the intercom that there had been a bomb threat made against American Airlines and 'this was just a precaution,' said Teresa Dietrich.

'It’s a little nerve-racking, because you’re not quite sure exactly what’s going on,' she said. 

Passengers were however allowed to take their carry-on luggage as they left the plane and they were then directed them to a grassy area on the side of the runway to await buses to take them to the terminal.

'It never seemed rushed; it never seemed panicked; it was fairly orderly,' Dietrich said. 

Sunday is one of the busiest travel days of the year on the roads and at airports, as millions of people who traveled for Thanksgiving return home after the long weekend.

The New York Fire Department tweeted about the bomb threat on Sunday morning
