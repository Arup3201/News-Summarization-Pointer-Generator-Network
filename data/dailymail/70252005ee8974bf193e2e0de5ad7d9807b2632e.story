An existential cat who ponders the absurdity of his existence has charmed the hearts of cat lovers worldwide and been crowned the star of the best viral cat video.

The internet hit, Henri 2, Paw de Deux, was awarded the Golden Kitty, a People’s Choice-styled prize at the Internet Cat Film Festival hosted by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Thursday night.

Thousands of popular internet films starring felines were submitted for review but Henri scored the top honor.

'While normally viewed alone on a computer screen ... come gather together on the field and LOL in the presence of others as your favorite silly cat videos are projected larger-than-life one after the other,' the museum announced in the invitation to the event, where the best of the web were viewed on a large screen at the center's Open Field.

The film, by director Will 
Braden, lasts only 2 minutes and 6 seconds but delves into the depths of
the silent star's psyche.

Done in the style of the Academy 
Awarding winning film The Artist, Braden crafts Camus-like captions 
imagining the mysteries that his feline friend spends the day pondering.

Henri's musings span from the sardonic to the absurd to the comical.

'I alone feel this torment,' one caption reads, as Henri stares solemnly at the audience.

Hooray for Henri! Cat fans screened the best of the web and couldn't hide their excitement for the feline stars

Gazing out the window at the picturesque, northwest scenery Henri declares, 'I am free to go. Yet I remain.'

Another shot shows the cat apathetically laying around, glumly acknowledging, 'I wake to the same tedium.'

Henri 2, Paw de Deux, which was uploaded in April, has already garnered over 3.2 million views on YouTube.

'This is a great honor. I don't think
I've ever purred this loudly,' Braden, a filmmaker based in Seattle, 
Washington, said in response to receiving the honor at the festival.

Henri also stars in two other Freud-like films and even has his own Facebook page, where fans can interact with the apathetic animal. 

'Humans should gather more often to 
appreciate their feline counterparts. We deserve it,' the Twitter 
account for Henri posted in reaction to the fest.
