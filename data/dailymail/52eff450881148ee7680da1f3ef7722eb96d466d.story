East Coasters braving snow and freezing rain on their morning commutes Monday won't find any  relief for six more weeks, at least according to clairvoyant critter Punxsutawney Phil.

The beloved Pennsylvania groundhog saw his shadow this Groundhog Day, meaning six more weeks of winter.

Meanwhile, his big city cousin Staten Island Chuck begs to differ. He did not see his shadow, which predicts an early spring. So which is it?

Hands off, de Blasio: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was on hand at the Staten Island Zoo on Monday, where staff told him hands -off the rodent. Last year, de Blasio dropped Chuck's female stand-in Charlotte and the groundhog died weeks later

New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio was on hand at the Staten Island Zoo, where he held a sign declaring 'Spring is coming.'

However, de Blasio was not invited to hold the rodent, says the New York Post. When he was afforded the privilege in 2014, he dropped Chuck--actually a female named Charlotte--who died weeks later from internal injuries.

Chuck 2.0 was instead kept inside a plexiglass cage. Staten Island Zoo staff claimed it was to prevent another incident like the one in 2013 when then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg was bitten by Chuck during the ceremony.

Will the ceremonial change in New York affect Chuck's accuracy? Punxatawney Phil seems to say yes.

The handlers of Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog said Monday the furry rodent has forecast six more weeks of winter.

Members of the top hat-wearing Inner Circle announced the 'prediction' Monday morning.

A German legend has it that if a furry rodent sees his shadow on Feb. 2, winter will last another six weeks. If not, spring comes early.

The forecast was also announced on Twitter, as was referenced in the official proclamation read by Jeff Lundy, the Fair Weatherman of the Inner Circle. 

'Forecasts abound on the Internet, but, I, Punxsutawney Phil am still your best bet. Yes, a shadow I see, you can start to Twitter, hash tag: Six more weeks of winter!'

The forecast was delivered after a steady pre-dawn rain turned to snow as temperatures dropped from the high 30s to around freezing. They were forecast to keep dropping over much of the state, prompting the state Department of Transportation to lower the speed limit to 45 mph for many interstate highways which were already wet and expected to freeze or be covered with snow as the day wore on. 

The rain kept some revelers away, with state police estimating the crowd at around 11,000, slightly smaller than in recent years when upward of 15,000 attended. 

Safe keeping: Staten Island Zoo staff kept Chuck  in a plexiglass enclosure, where he was safe from the mayor's butter fingers

Early spring? Mayor de Blasio held up a sign that declared 'Spring is coming' after Chuck failed to see his shadow--which predicts an early spring

No mention was made of Sunday night's Super Bowl, unlike Groundhog Day 2009 - the last time the celebration occurred the morning after the big game - which was won by the nearby Pittsburgh Steelers that year.

Despite the German legend, Phil's handlers don't wait to see if he sees his shadow - as he likely would not have on such an overcast day.

Instead, the Inner Circle decide on the forecast ahead of time and announce it on Gobbler's Knob, a tiny hill in the town for which the groundhog is named, about 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.

Records going back to 1887 show Phil has now predicted more winter 102 times while forecasting an early spring just 17 times. There are no records for the remaining years.
