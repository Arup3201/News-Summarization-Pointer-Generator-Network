Golden Years takes to the skies this week, as Sportsmail's weekly nostalgic picture series brings you a spectacular set of aerial images.

From the magic of the old Wembley in the 1920s, through to the newly rebuilt Maracana, we take you on a journey around some of the game's hallowed homes. There's the old Highbury and Manchester City's Maine Road, a television cameraman at Filbert Street and Hackney Marshes playing fields in east London in the Sixties.

If these pictures bring back any memories for you, please feel free to share them in the comments section beneath this article.

And we'll return with more photographs from football's archives next week.

We begin with an aerial view of Wembley here in 1928, as the teams line up for a Home International between England and Scotland. It was to prove a joyous day for the visiting team, with Alex Jackson scoring a hat-trick in a 5-1 Scottish win at the five-year-old stadium

The Centenario in Montevideo plays host to the very first World Cup final in 1930 between Uruguay and Argentina. The hosts claimed a 4-2 win in front of a crowd of 68,346. Only 13 teams - including seven from South America and four from Europe - took part in that tournament

An aerial picture of Manchester City's famous old Maine Road home, for a visit of Sheffield Wednesday in 1934. City played at the ground for 80 years, between 1923 and 2003. City recorded the highest home attendance ever for any English club, 84,569, for an FA Cup sixth round clash with Stoke in 1934

A delightful view from the skies here of Hampden Park in 1954, during a clash between Scotland and England. The visitors won the game 4-2, in front of a huge crowd of 134,554. The record attendance at the stadium is 149,415, for a match between Scotland and England in 1937

A view from above here of some of the 51,000 fans attending Arsenal's first match of the 1956-57 season at Highbury, a game against Cardiff that ended in a 0-0 draw. This picture tells us as much about a street scene in 1950s London as it does about a football stadium

A fabulous picture here of the first match to be played at Wembley under floodlights, an Inter Cities Fairs Cup clash between London and Frankfurt in October, 1955. The lights were installed at a cost of £22,000. Surprisingly, it wasn't until November 1963 that England played their first full match under the lights, when they beat Northern Ireland 8-3

An aerial view here of Hackney Marshes in 1962. Millions of people have played on this huge area of grassland in east London, and they are still seen as the spiritual home of Sunday league football. This picture shows the extraordinary number of matches that can take place there at the same time

Ibrox, the home of Rangers here in 1962, where a Scottish Cup semi-final between Celtic and St Mirren is taking place. A crowd of nearly 60,000 saw St Mirren claim a memorable 3-1 win over the Glasgow giants. A few weeks later, St Mirren lost the final to Rangers at Hampden

Another one of world football's, and indeed world sport's, most famous venues here, Munich's Olympic Stadium, pictured  in 1972 during a friendly match between West Germany and the USSR. That same year, the stadium was the main venue for the Olympic Games

One of world football's most fabled stadiums here, Rio's Maracana, shown from the air during a friendly match between Brazil and Czechoslovakia in 1975. The record attendance at the huge ground was 199,850, for the final match of the 1950 World Cup between Brazil and Uruguay. The Maracana has been completely renovated over recent years (more of that below)

Above, a picture of the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires during the opening ceremony of the 1978 World Cup. The stadium, which is the home of River Plate, staged the final some weeks later, where hosts Argentina beat Holland. Below, the Rose Bowl in Pasadena during the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Ten years later, it hosted the World Cup final between Brazil and Italy

An aerial view of Wembley here, and a memorable encounter between old rivals England and Scotland at Euro 96. The hosts claimed a 2-0 victory, thanks to a header from Alan Shearer and a glorious second goal from Paul Gascoigne. Scotland had a marvellous chance to equalise before Gascoigne struck, but David Seaman saved Gary McAllister's penalty

Here's a Match of the Day cameraman recording the action at Filbert Street, and a match between Leicester and Tottenham in 1997. The Foxes claimed a comfortable 3-0 win, with goals from Steve Walsh, Steve Guppy and Emile Heskey. By this time, the BBC's flagship Saturday night football  programme, which used to feature only a handful of matches, showed action from every game in the top flight

An enormous crowd gathers here in the centre of Seoul for the 2002 World Cup semi-final between South Korea and Germany. As many as seven million people watched the match throughout the country on various giant public screens - but the Germans won 1-0

A picture from the skies of the new Wembley Stadium in 2007, just before its official opening. The iconic twin towers had been replaced by an arch. The first game to be held at the rebuilt stadium took place in March 2007, an Under 21 clash between England and Italy. The first FA Cup final at the new Wembley in May 2007, saw Chelsea beat Manchester United

This 2008 picture shows how close Arsenal's famous old ground Highbury (right, being converted into flats and shops) was to their new home at the Emirates (left). The Gunners, who had been at the historic ground for 93 years, played their final match there in 2006

A picture here of Molineux, home of Wolverhampton Wanderers, in 2003. This year, Wolves have been celebrating 125 years of football at their famous home. The first fixture was a 2-0 league victory versus Notts County on September 7th, 1889. The record attendance at the ground is 61,305, for an FA Cup fifth round clash with Liverpool in 1939

Our final pictures both come from Rio. Above, an incredible picture shows the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue in the foreground, and the newly rebuilt Maracana, which hosted the World Cup final, in the background. Below, a huge crowd watches a World Cup match at the special Rio 'Fan Fest' on the Copacabana beach. Fans gathering on the beach helped to provide striking images from the tournament
