A young boy miraculously escaped serious injury when a private jet crashed through his house this evening, killing two people and sending three to the hospital.

Neighbors say the child received only a scratch on his head as the Beechcraft Premier I twin-jet slammed through a neighborhood in South Bend, Indiana - plowing through two houses before coming to a rest upside-down in the middle of a third.

The jet was landing at South Bend Regional Airport after a flight from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Four people were aboard the plane at the time. Two were killed. Two were injured, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Roland Herwig told MailOnline.

Stan Klaybor, who lives across the street from the crash scene, said the jet clipped the top of one house, heavily damaged a second, and finally came to rest against a third

Neighbors did not know if a woman living in the most heavily damaged house was home at the time, and a young boy in the third house did not appear to be seriously injured, Klaybor said.

'Her little boy was in the kitchen and he got nicked here,' Klaybor said, pointing to his forehead.
