Bill Badger was a hero even before he helped save people's lives during the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting in a grocery store parking lot that killed six people and injured 13, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords.

The Army veteran died Wednesday morning of pneumonia, according to his wife, Sallie Badger. He was 78 years old. 

Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived. Loughner is serving seven consecutive life terms in prison.

Remembered: In this November 8, 2012 file photo, Bill Badger points his hand in the shape of a gun as he describes the events of the day Jared Loughner killed six people and wounded 13 others, following Loughner's sentencing to life in prison at U.S. District Court in Tucson, Arizona

Shooting: Bill Badger was shot in the head at a constituent event for Giffords, who was the target of gunman Jared Loughner. But Badger managed to tackle Loughner, helping others hold him down and disarm him before police arrived. A memorial plaque for the shootings is seen on January 8, 2014 

Giffords, who lives in Tucson, said she was sad to learn of Badger's death. 

She said in a statement 'I'm so sad to learn that Bill Badger has passed away. Bill was not only a great man and a proud Army veteran, he was a hero. On January 8, 2011, Bill was wounded in the head by a bullet from the gun of my would-be assassin. Not even pausing to realize he had been injured, Bill ran towards the shooter and towards danger so that he could help subdue him until the authorities arrived. I believe that Bill helped save lives that morning. And I will always be grateful to him for his selfless, brave actions.

'My heart, thoughts, and prayers are with Bill's loved ones as they mourn the loss of a great man.'

Rep. Ron Barber also released a statement, which said in part 'The label "hero" an be overused, but Bill was undoubtedly one of the true heroes when a gunman opened fire at the shopping center on January 8, 2011. Although he had been grazed by a bullet and was bleeding from his head, Bill disregarded his own well-being and joined two others to stop the gunman.

'Six people died that day and 13 others of us were wounded — but the toll would have been much higher had not Bill taken fast action when the gunman paused to reload. I will forever be grateful for his bravery and the lives he saved.'

Sallie Badger said it came as no surprise that her husband had risked his life to help others. The retired Army colonel had spent his entire life doing just that, she said.

'Bill was a hero to many, many people long before he became a hero on Jan. 8. He was very influential in many, many young lives in many ways,' Sallie Badger said.

She said Badger was highly involved in the life of their 25-year-old son, Christian Badger. Badger also guided young men into the military and other careers, she said.

Bill Badger hailed from South Dakota. He joined the National Guard as a high school junior and went on to have a long, distinguished career as an Army pilot for 37 years.

The couple moved to Arizona in 1985 when Bill Badger established the Western Army Aviation Training Site in Marana, just outside of Tucson. 

On January 9, 2011, Badger told KOLD 'The shooting stopped and I raised up and didn't realize it, but he was right beside me. Right in front of me. And I got to my feet and one of the individuals who was there to see her was on the other side of the walkway, you know, right where he was walking and that individual took a folding chair, folded it and hit him on the back of the head and he moved his head forward so much of the blunt of it came right on the shoulders of his back and when they did that his left arm came out and it was my opportunity.

'I grabbed his left arm and started to twist it back and grabbed him on the shoulder with my right hand another individual grabbed his right hand and together we pushed on him and he went right down on the sidewalk.

'I had a hold of his throat and the guy on the other side had his knee right on the back of his neck, and every time he would struggle, I would squeeze his throat and the guy would put pressure on the back of his neck.' 

Badger was not permanently injured from the bullet that grazed the back of his head, but he showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, his wife said.

The couple embarked on a three-year journey across the country to push for stricter gun laws.

'We wanted desperately to have background checks on every gun that was sold,' Sallie Badger said. 'And Bill just made that his mission.'

Legacy: Badger joined the National Guard as a high school junior and went on to have a long, distinguished career as an Army pilot for 37 years. He is seen with his wife Sallie Badger on August 7, 2012, after Loughner entered a plea agreement which sent him to prison for the rest of his life
