QPR owner Tony Fernandes admitted he wouldn't stand in Harry Redknapp's way if the opportunity to manage England arose. 

In an interview with the Evening Standard, the 50-year-old insisted he won't wreck his manager's dreams. 

Redknapp was linked with the national team job in 2012 but the FA appointed Roy Hodgson after Fabio Capello's resigned just prior to Euro 2012.   

Thumbs up: Tony Fernandes is delighted with Harry Redknapp's work but wouldn't stand in his way if England want to appoint him in the future 

Focus: For now Redknapp is concentrating on keeping QPR in the Premier League 

Redknapp was acquitted in his tax evasion trial hours before Capello's resignation the Roy Hodgson was appointed to the post without the 67-year-old being approached.  

Fernandes said: 'I would, of course, hate to lose Harry. But I am not going to stand in the way of someone’s dream. Harry will make a great England manager. But that’s beyond my control.

'How do you stop Harry from being England manager? You are sad, disappointed but you have got to be realistic, you’ve got to be philosophical.

'We are looking at another year at a minimum. I enjoy Harry. He is full of stories, full of laughs. We joke around a lot.'
