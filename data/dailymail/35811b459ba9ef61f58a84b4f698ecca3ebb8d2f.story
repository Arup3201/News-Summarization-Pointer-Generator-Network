A British woman has been arrested for allegedly helping organise a £4.3million timeshare fraud that targeted thousands of tourists.

Paula Beatson is one of 58 people – mostly Britons – held when police raided timeshare showrooms in Gran Canaria.

The 44-year-old is believed to be the financial brain behind a scam in which about 2,000 holidaymakers paid up to £25,000 each for timeshare properties that they could not use.

British citizens are among 58 people busted in Gran Canaria for allegedly raking in £5million by selling timeshare properties that never existed to 2,000 victims

It is claimed that swarms of sales 
agents posing as representatives of the Canary Island tourist office 
targeted British tourists on the streets of towns in the island’s south.

The ‘tiqueteros’ (ticket touts) would 
snare potential clients with prize-winning ‘scratch cards’ and supposed 
free gifts, encouraging them to attend a promotion.

Some customers were even given a free 
taxi ride to attend intensive sales pitches at the timeshare base in an 
apartment complex called Club Puerto Atlantico in Arguineguin.

Once inside they could be subjected to
 eight hours of ‘hard sell’ of a scheme that would give them access to 
luxury holidays at a heavily discounted rate.

Customers are believed to have paid 
out between £4,300 and £25,000 for the guarantee of 70 per cent 
discounts at some of the world’s top resorts for between five and 30 
years. But the timeshare sellers were allegedly using the glossy 
brochures of other top holiday firms to sell the concept.

Spanish police raided offices and showrooms in Arguineguin and Mogan on Monday after being tipped off that staff were deliberately deceiving tourists over the timeshare schemes (stock image)

Even the discounts they offered could be found in a high street travel agent.

A Spanish police source said: ‘They were selling a complete and utter lie.’

They are accused of carrying out the fraud since 2007.

Spanish news agencies yesterday 
reported that the ‘well-organised group’ used various business names to 
carry out the con. They allegedly included Voyager Travel and Lifestyle 
Holidays as well as companies that promised to extract tourists from any
 preexisting timeshare agreements.

Paula Beatson, believed to be from 
Lancashire, was named as one of those arrested along with German Eugen 
Friedrich Kaiser and Norwegian Kieron Day. It is understood that both 
Beatson and Kaiser were previously accused of fraud in 2006 but were not
 convicted of any crime.

The Mindtimeshare Association, a 
Spanish watchdog, became aware of the group after receiving more than 60
 complaints. It contacted police, who launched ‘Operation Voyager’, 
leading to the arrests on Monday.

Alberto Garcia, the director of 
Mindtimeshare, said: ‘Paula was the financial brain of the operation. 
After several years of thorough analysis and collection of the victim’s 
testimonials, the Mindtimeshare Association decided to present a formal 
demand to the Spanish police.

‘This demand has been backed up by 
strong evidence of how this organised gang was lying and cheating in 
order to make the tourists fall into their trap and make them buy their 
allegedly fraudulent product.’

Those arrested have been released on 
bail after giving statements. The Special Organised Crime Unit is 
continuing its investigations.

Last night the Foreign Office said the Spanish police had not made it aware of  the arrests.
