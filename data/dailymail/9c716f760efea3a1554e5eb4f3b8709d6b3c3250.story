Video footage has emerged of Afghan police humiliating a cross-dressing man by forcing him to undress on camera apparently for their own amusement.

The Afghan male, seen initially wearing a long shiny black wig, jewellery and a flowing black robe, is ordered to remove all his female attire despite protests of innocence.

The man is cruelly humiliated as officers demand he remove the wig, jewellery robe during the eight-minute video.

The unknown Afghan cross-dresser's ordeal begins when he is ordered by police to take his black wig off

By the end he is stood in a scarlet short-sleeved traditional female dress with his receding hair on full show.

As police officers appear to laugh and goad the cross-dressing man, he pleads for mercy and can be heard saying, 'Don't make fun of me.'

At one point he even suffers the indignity of having to remove fake breasts from under his dress, which turn out to be two socks filled with dough.

Upon seeing this, an officer comments: 'Dough to make the breasts feel softy-soft.'

According to the Guardian, the officers then deliver a barrage of questions to the transvestite and a second man who is arrested.

The man is next forced to remove his black dress, to reveal a bright red female garment underneath as the humiliation continues

The Afghan man protests that he 'hasn't committed any crime', but is still made to remove all his female clothing by police

His humiliation comes to an end after he is ordered by Afghan police to remove the two fake breasts from under his dress, which turn out to be two socks filled with dough

They ask the pair: 'Why are you dressed like this? Where did you put the makeup on? What is all this about? What have you two been up to?'

As the Afghan cross dresser removes his jewellery, he can be heard to whisper: 'I was shopping for clothes.'

After being near reduced to tears, the second man tells police officers: 'Please, officer, we haven't committed a crime.'

The video, which appears to have originated from an Afghan news source, is listed as being filmed in Kabul on Friday.

It is not clear what eventually happened to the two victims, but the footage has since been viewed nearly 25,000 times online.

Homosexuality and crossdressing are considered criminal offences in Afghanistan, with the regime change in the country doing very little to alter gay rights.
