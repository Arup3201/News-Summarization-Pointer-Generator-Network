Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone was at his most hyperactive as last season's Champions League finalists were given a major shock in Leverkusen.

Hakan Calhanoglus's 57th minute strike was the least the Germans deserved in a fiery encounter that saw arm-waving Simeone argue with the fourth official, former Chelsea man Tiago sent off and 10 yellow cards.

Atletico sub Fernando Torres was also booked late on after becoming involved in a scuffle in which he shoved Son Heung-Min.

It wasn't a good night overall for the Spaniards. Emir Spahic hit the Atletico crossbar and Madrid striker Mario Mandzukick forced to clear off the line as the Liga champions looked a pale shadow of the side who came within seconds of European glory last season before losing in extra-time to neighbours Real.

With Arsenal target Lars Bender pulling the strings for Leverkusen, the home side dominated in their all-red strip roared on by a vociferous capacity crowd of 30,000.

The arm-waving Simeone bellowed at his defenders when Spahic hit the woodwork from 25 yards and then complained to delegates when his skipper Gabi was taken out by two German defenders.

Tempers were frayed on both sides with Leverkusen defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos booked for jostling referee Pavel Kralovec after being penalised for a foul.

Leverkusen were rewarded when a clever back-heel by Karim Bellarabi set up Calhanoglu who lashed his finish into the roof of the net from 10 yards.

Simeone responded by sending on Atletico's prodigal son Torres for his first Champions League action for 10 months.

Torres had a 75th minute header ruled out because Madrid's corner had gone out of play and then Tiago picked up a second yellow for a crude lunge at Bellarabi.

Atletico, third in La Liga, turned up at the Bayer Arena as favourites but were immediately pinned back by a red tide.

They knew Leverkusen were up for it when holding midfielder Bender made a rare venture forward and though he sent his shot wide, an excitable Simeone came to the edge of his technical area to wave his arms furiously at his defenders.

It didn't have any immediate effect. In Leverkusen's next attack after 12 minutes, Wendell's strike was goalbound until centre-forward Mandzukic produced a timely hoof off the line.

Atletico were seconds away from completing a La Liga-Champions League double last May, conceding a late equaliser in the European final to Realwho went on to win 4-1 in extra-time.

Top scorer Diego Costa has since departed even though Torres is back and was among the subs last night, their usual intensity was more than matched by their German opponents.

Leverkusen are sixth in the Bundesliga and with skipper Bender marshalling the side in front of the back-four, they were the better side.

After 25 minutes, the Atletico crossbar was left shaking by Spahic's piledriver that had goalkeeper Miguel Angel Moya beaten.

As the Spaniards grew increasingly rattled, Tiago – a former Chelsea man - was booked for a cynical trip in midfield which did nothing to restrain Simeone's routine on the touchline complete with oustretched arm gestures and exasperated shouts.

It wasn't just him though – Leverkusen were so frustrated at not making their supremacy count, five of them angrily surrounded Mr Kravolec for awarding a foul against Papadopoulos.

The Greek defender was so incensed he appeared ready to push the official over until a yellow card waved in his face forced him to back off.

Atletico's first proper chance arrived after 39 minutes when keeper Bernd Leno had to claw the ball away as French international Antoine Griezmann was set to head in Arda Turan's cross. And just before half-time, he made an even better save from Tiago with his left hand that had Atletico's Portuguese international still holding his head as he walked off for half-time.

They were rare forays though. The irony is that Leverkusen were less dominant in the second half but that is when they scored with Turk Calhanoglu almost breaking the back of the net with his finish.

Josip Drmic almost added a second and the bad blood lasted until the final whistle when Torres was chopped by Spahic and sought retribution by shoving Son Heung-Min when he got up. It looked like Torres had got the wrong man but was booked for his trouble.
