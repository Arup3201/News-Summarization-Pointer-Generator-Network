Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told parliament that Russian-backed rebels launched an artillery strike on the town. 

He said: 'Twenty-five minutes ago, the main headquarters of our anti-terrorist operation took a strike from a Tornado rocket. The headquarters took this strike, but a second strike was carried out on residential areas of Kramatorsk.

Kramatorsk was the site of major fighting until July when pro-Russian separatists retreated

'There is information about wounded service personnel. There is information about a significant number of wounded among civilians,' he added.

The government-controlled Donetsk regional administration said the rockets had been fired from the rebel-controlled Horlivka area, which is about 50 km away from Kramatorsk. 

Kramatorsk was the site of major fighting until July when pro-Russian separatists retreated. 

The fighting, which the UN says has killed more than 5,300 people since April, comes ahead of a crucial summit involving Western leaders tomorrow, as well as peace talks later today.  

The volunteer Azov battalion, loyal to Kiev, said on social media that it had captured several villages north east of the strategic port of Mariupol, pushing the rebels closer to the border with Russia. 

However, rebel military spokesman Eduard Basurin said in a televised news conference the rebels had not retreated.

The Azov said rebels shelled the village of Kominternove, east of Mariupol, causing unspecified civilian casualties.

The rebels also reported advances. Mr Basurin said they had surrounded the railway hub of Debaltseve, the focus of fierce fighting in past weeks, cutting it off from a major road. 

A video posted online by a rebel-sympathisng website showed separatists moving along the route while the bloodied bodies of Ukrainian soldiers lay on the side of the road.

At least seven Ukrainian troops were killed overnight in the east, military spokesman Anatoliy Matyukhin said. In the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, which comes under constant shelling, two civilians were killed and 12 injured.

The fierce fighting and a mounting death toll comes amid renewed efforts to work out a peaceful solution in a conflict that has displaced at least a million people and left the powerhouse of the Ukrainian economy in ruins.

Representatives of Ukraine, Russia, rebels and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe are meeting for long-anticipated talks later today in Minsk to lay the groundwork for a meeting tomorrow between the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France.

The Kremlin today warned the West ahead of the talks against sending weapons to Ukraine or putting pressure on Russia.

President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told the Russian News Service radio station that any talk about imposing new sanctions on Russia or arming the Ukraine government would destabilise the situation.

In Washington yesterday, President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel rallied behind efforts to reach a long-shot diplomatic resolution to the conflict, but they offered no clear path for how the West would proceed if talks this week fail.

Ms Merkel staunchly opposed arming Ukraine's beleaguered military while Mr Obama dangled the prospect that the US could for the first time send weapons to Ukraine.
