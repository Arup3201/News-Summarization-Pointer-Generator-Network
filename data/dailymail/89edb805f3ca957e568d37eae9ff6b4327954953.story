Park Ji-sung was given a hero's welcome as he was presented to PSV Eindhoven supporters before a Dutch league game on Wednesday, but the  reception nearly became too hot to handle when a banner held in tribute to him caught fire.

Park retired from football in May 2014 due to a knee problem and was visiting the Eredivisie table-toppers to see them take on rivals Feyenoord. 

Fans held a banner with a picture of the South Korean playing for the club, with the caption 'warrior from the south', but a flare set fire to it as he walked out on to the pitch.

The Manchester United ambassador enjoyed two spells at the Dutch side as a player, from 2002-2005 and a loan spell in the 2013-14 season, and was delighted to be back at the Philips Stadion.

'I am very pleased to be here after my retirement, it is a good feeling,' said Park, who admitted he still receives pain from the knee injury that forced him to retire at the age of 33.

'I have pain on my knee, when I'm running I feel pain, but otherwise nothing so I am really enjoying my life at the moment.'

And Park was a good omen for  PSV, as they beat Feyenoord 4-3 thanks to a hat-trick from Luuk de Jong and an injury time winner from Memphis Depay.
