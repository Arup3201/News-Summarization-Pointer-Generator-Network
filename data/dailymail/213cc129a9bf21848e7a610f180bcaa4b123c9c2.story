The Duchess of Cambridge opted for a new hairstyle as she met schoolchildren yesterday - and it stole the limelight, for all the wrong reasons.

Instead
 of her usual relaxed waves, Kate’s glossy mane was pinned in a half-up,
 half-down style, back-combed on top, and teased into tight ringlets provoking fans to describe it as 'dated'.

However, as she arrived at Wimbledon today for the quarter finals, the Royal's hair was back to its glossy best.

Back at its glossy best! A glossy maned Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William arrive on Centre Court ahead of the quarter final match between Sabine Lisicki of Germany and Simona Halep of Romania

The 32-year-old looked summertime chic wearing a recycled dress by Australian designer, Zimmerman.

Kate
 last wore the white lace sundress as she 
and William attended the Royal Easter Show at Olympic Park in Sydney in April.

Shoppers crashed the website of 
the Australian designer after the Duchess of Cambridge chose the 
label for the third day of the couple's Down Under tour.

Happy to be here! The new mother seemed to be in high spirits as she took her seat wearing a dress by an Australian designer

Changing styles: Yesterday, on a visit to a local school, Kate wore her hair in rather an unusual style, which fans branded 'dated', left, but today, right, it was back to its famous and much-loved style

Today, she paired the knee-length 'Roamer' day dress, which retails at £274 (AUD

with a pair of beige corked wedge heels and as usual, carried a small wicker clutch bag.

Zimmerman is one of Australia's best known designer labels, often seen on the back of the fashion elite

Equally famous for their swimsuits as well as their sophisticated and delicate clothing, sisters Nicky and Simone Zimmermann founded their namesake label in 1991 in Sydney.

The much-loved brand has become synonymous with Australian style, and is stocked internationally as well as in boutiques and department stores around Australia.

She also had a red pashmina to hand in case of any chilly breezes later on today as she laughed and joked with husband William in the Royal Box.

Her parents, Carol and Michael, as well as William's cousin Princess Beatrice were also out in force in SW19 today.

It's been a busy week for the new mother who yesterday joined comedian John Bishop at a London 
Primary School.

Wearing
 a shocking salmon pink dress by her new favourite label, Goat, Kate 
sank to her knees to chat to youngsters who cheered and waved the 
English flag.

The Duchess 
visited the Blessed Sacrament School in Islington, north London, to view
 the progress of M-PACT Plus, a project which helps address the 
difficult issue of addiction in families.

The Duchess launched M-PACT Plus with comedian John Bishop on a visit to Manchester in 2013 when she was pregnant with her son, Prince George.

The
 project is funded by The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge and Prince Harry - the vehicle for the trio's charitable 
initiatives - in conjunction with Comic Relief and two charities of 
which Kate is royal patron, Place2be and Action on Addiction.

M-PACT Plus provides early support for school children affected by a parent's drug or alcohol misuse.

Look who else turned up! Dave Clark and Princess Beatrice of York also took their seats in the Royal Box - despite partying late last night at The Chiltern Firehouse
