Gordon Strachan blamed end-of-season rust for the 90th-minute goal which sealed a nightmare evening for Grant Hanley and denied Scotland the scalp of World Cup qualifiers Nigeria.

Leading 2-1 with seconds to play, his team looked certain to make it six wins in their last nine games after an outrageous goal from Charlie Mulgrew and a second-half own goal from Azubuike Egwuekwe.

On a night to forget for Hanley at Fulham’s Craven Cottage, however, Michael Uchebo’s first-half equaliser took a wicked deflection off the centre-half – before he failed to clear his lines as substitute Uche Nwofor levelled in injury time.

‘I liked a lot of things I saw there, the only thing we had a problem with was the fact some of the lads had not trained for three weeks,’ said Strachan, indicating that weariness was the only difference between a win and a draw.

‘Most of them had been on holiday somewhere. I’m not saying they weren’t looking after themselves, and the way they tried to switch on again at training was terrific. But we lost a wee bit of fitness in the last 15 minutes.

'During the game, we were one pass away from a really great move. We could have had four or five goals.  That’s the first time I’ve said that after a game - we had a lot of chances.

‘I’d put the fact we didn’t finish them off down to rustiness. In terms of what I saw and what we are trying do, in terms of movement and trying to get closer to the striker, I liked that.

'The shape we had when we didn’t have the ball was good as well.’

Scotland 
took the lead through an outrageous and audacious Mulgrew effort, the 
Celtic star flicking out a heel to deflect a James Morrison shot into 
the net.

‘Charlie’s
 goal was terrific. It was luck in terms of the shot but he had to know 
where to send it,’ said Strachan. ‘There is a lot to be proud of, I’m 
just disappointed we didn’t get the win.’

Strachan admitted Hanley was disappointed with his failure to clear his lines for the last-gasp equaliser.

Adamant the Scots had no failures, however, the Scotland boss also blooded Derby’s Chris Martin for the first time as a second half substitute.

‘The first Nigeria goal was unlucky for us. The ricochet might go in itself. But I thought Grant was terrific,’ he said.

‘Nobody has disappointed me. Chris Martin gave us a new dimension. Midfielders like it when the ball goes up to someone like that. It’s a new thing in football - the strikers are not scoring 40 or 50 goals a season. They score 20 or so but have to link up and let others score, too. He is good that way.

‘In terms of positive play, that’s as good as it gets. We have been terrific as a unit before and had a few chances, but overall there was a bit of flair and imagination against a really top side.

‘Andrew Robertson and Kech (Ikechi Anya) were terrific down that left side. With hardly any caps between them, they’re not physically big but they stood up and played the game. They didn’t let them get close to them.

‘Anya is terrific, a breath of fresh air. He radiates on the pitch and in the dressing room. That’s all you can ask for.’
