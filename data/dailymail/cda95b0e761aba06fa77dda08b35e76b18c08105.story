Scotland would lose more than five per cent of its economic output if it broke away from the UK, a study found yesterday.

An international dividing line between Scotland and England would discourage cross-border trade and cut 5.5 per cent from Scottish gross domestic product, it said.

The calculations - made by two of Scotland’s leading economists - suggest that independence would have cost the country almost £8 billion in 2012.

The huge fall in wealth creation would occur as an automatic result of setting up a border, the study claimed.

Scotland would lose more than five per cent of its economic output if it broke away from the UK, experts have claimed. Scots will vote in the referendum over whether they stay as part of Britain in September

Further losses caused by independence could then include major companies fleeing an independent Scotland, or higher interest rates as a result of the potential loss of the pound.

The projections will further inflame the fierce debate over economic impact of independence that has become the central argument in advance of the September independence referendum.

The new assessment is based on an analysis of the way international borders suppress trade to a greater extent than regional boundaries which run inside countries.

Dr David Comerford of Stirling University - who is currently working for the Scottish Government on improving economic forecasting - and Professor Jose V. Rodriguez Mora of Edinburgh University looked at the effect on trade of the border between the UK and Ireland.

Ireland, they said was ‘the country with which the UK has the lowest measured trade frictions.’

They also examined the borders between Spain and Portugal; the US, Canada, and Mexico; and inside the EU.

Their report, presented to the Royal Economic Society conference in Manchester, said that international borders ‘impede trade flows’.

The study, by Scotland's two leading economists, backs the case for Scotland staying part of the UK, as advocated by Alistair Darling MP (second left). An international border between Scotland and England would discourage trade and cut 5.5 per cent from Scottish GDP

Reasons why include the way service industries tend to operate mainly inside their own countries, and people’s preference for buying from their own national companies rather than foreign competitors, the study said.

‘National borders impede trade flows much more strongly than do the borders between regions within a country,’ the report said.

‘The scale of the difference between national and regional borders is such that there may be significant welfare or productivity effects from removing borders between countries, or conversely from creating borders within existing nation states.’

It added: ‘Sharing a nation state produces a substantially higher degree of economic integration than even a very close trading relationship between independent countries.’

Scottish nationalists have denounced Chancellor George Osborne's threat to without the pound as bullying

The ‘friction’ in trade between economically developed countries and EU member countries is ‘significantly higher’ than the drag on trade by borders between US states, Canadian provinces or Spanish regions, the report said.

If Scotland were to trade only internally - so that Scottish companies did business only with other Scottish firms - that would cost Scotland 16.3 per cent of its economic output, the economists calculated.

Setting up an international border with the UK would cost Scotland more than a quarter of what it would lose by abolishing foreign trade entirely, they said.

The two economists said their estimates were ‘on the conservative side’ and that losses could be greater because ‘part of the border effect is due to a large degree of home bias in services trade.’

They added that part of the reason for losses if a border is created is that inefficient and mediocre companies would find it easier in Scotland.

‘Mediocre firms that would find it impossible to survive when facing direct competition from the rest of a larger country, would find it profitable to survive in the independence scenario. This is because they are sheltered from more intense competition.

‘Unproductive but local firms find themselves in a better competitive position, and the access more of what is now a captive market.’

Rows over the future of Scotland’s economy have come to dominate the arguments between yes and no camps in the run-up to the 18 September referendum.

Nationalists have denounced as bullying the warning by Chancellor George Osborne, backed by Labour and LibDem leaders, that the pound will not be shared with an independent Scotland.

While the yes camp says a UK government would inevitably do a deal on the pound, and an anonymous leak suggests one London minister agrees, losing the pound threatens Scotland with high interest rates or loss of control of its own currency.

There have also been a series of warnings from major companies that they would shift headquarters out of Scotland if independence came.
