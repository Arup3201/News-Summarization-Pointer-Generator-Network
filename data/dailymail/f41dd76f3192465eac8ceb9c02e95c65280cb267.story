Four English clubs have qualified for the quarter-finals of Europe’s premier tournament for the first time since 1997-98 and only the second time in the history of continental competition.

However, Saracens, Wasps, Bath and Northampton have all been drawn away in the Champions Cup last eight, with three of the fixtures taking place in France.

The line-up is a reflection of the balance of power in Europe, with the big change from recent seasons being the decreased impact of the Irish provinces. Only Leinster have progressed to the knockout stage and they will welcome a confident Bath side to Dublin.

‘Leinster will be great for us,’ said Bath director of rugby Mike Ford. ‘We don’t mind going away from home, we like travelling! No one will fancy playing us.’

Saracens’ defeat at Clermont yesterday has condemned them to a trip to Paris to face Racing Metro, although Mark McCall and his men will take heart from their opponents’ wild fluctuations in form. However, at their best Racing are formidable, as they emphasised in putting Northampton to the sword at Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday.

Saints’ reward for that hammering is a trip to Clermont. Stade Marcel Michelin is arguably the most forbidding arena in European rugby so Jim Mallinder’s side will be clear underdogs.

Wasps managed to sneak through to the quarter-finals after their 20-20 draw with Leinster left them sweating

Wasps were made to sweat after their 20-20 draw with Leinster in Coventry, but yesterday’s results went their way and they progress as runners-up in Pool 2.

They take on mighty Toulon in southern France and Dai Young’s team will be long-shot outsiders to upset the galacticos.
