This baboon wasn't monkeying around, it just wanted a ride.

Jericho the horse looked less than impressed by the unwanted passenger as he tried to enjoy a lazy afternoon in the sun at an animal sanctuary in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa.

Nevertheless, patient Jericho gave the cheeky primate a reasonable ride around the grounds of Monkeyland and Birds of Eden, much to the amusement of onlookers.
