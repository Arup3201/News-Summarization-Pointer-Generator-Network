A former BBC manager with a 'pathological loathing' for Respect MP George Galloway has been jailed for attacking him in a London street while calling him an 'anti-semite little man'.

Drug addict Neil Masterson, 39, punched the Bradford West MP ten times before delivering a 'Kung fu kick' during the frenzied assault in Notting Hill.

Masterson - who was wearing a pink t-shirt with an Israel Defence Forces logo when arrested - told police he felt 'morally justified' in attacking the MP because he was a 'Nazi' with a 'shameful' attitude towards Jews, Isleworth Crown Court heard.

A man has been jailed for 16 months after Respect MP George Galloway (pictured) was left with cuts and bruises following a 'frenzied assault' in Notting Hill in August this year

Drug addict Neil Masterson (pictured) - a former BBC manager and government worker - felt 'morally justified' in attacking the MP because he was a 'Nazi' with a 'shameful' attitude towards Jews, a court heard

Galloway - who now claims he cannot hug anyone without being in pain - believes he would have been killed if Masterson had been armed with a knife during their chance meeting, the court heard.  

Masterson, of Kensington, who had 'recently undergone a conversion towards Judaism', had previously admitted assaulting Mr Galloway, who he saw as a 'serpent' and 'enemy of Judaism',

The former government worker also admitted a second charge of common assault against Dr Mostafa Maroof, who had been posing for a photo with the MP and was pushed when he tried to intervene.

But he denied that the attack - which left the politician with cuts and bruises to his head and ribs - was religiously aggravated.

Sentencing Masterson to 16 months in jail, Judge Aidan Marron QC said the attack in August was a 'disturbing example' of public violence.

He said: 'While you are no longer facing a charge of religiously aggravated assault, it would be unreal to ignore that the motivation for this ... was your profound hostility to Mr Galloway's views. 

'It would have been much worse and continued longer had not two members of the public intervened robustly.'  

Mr Galloway - who had described his constituency as an 'Israel-free zone' earlier this year - welcomed the sentence but questioned the decision to drop a charge of religiously aggravated assault.

He said: 'The sentence is reasonable in the circumstances.

'However, had the charge of religiously aggravated assault not been dropped I'm sure it would have been considerably longer and I fail to see why that charge was dropped given that he was wearing an IDF T-shirt and screaming about Israel at me.

After the attack, the Respect Party told its Twitter followers that Mr Galloway was on his way to hospital

'If an Asian man wearing a Palestinian T-shirt had attacked a pro-Israeli MP would the sentence have been the same?' 

The court heard how the incident unfolded while the 60-year-old former Labour MP was in London on private business.

Prosecutor Michelle Nelson told the court he was posing for a photo near his car in Golborne Road with Moroccan doctor Mostafa Maroof and a friend when Masterson approached them 'in a rage'.

She said Masterson mentioned the Holocaust, leading Mr Galloway to fear the man was a right-wing extremist.

Masterson then punched the MP ten times before delivering a 'Kung-fu style' kick which did not connect but caused Mr Galloway to fall into the road.

The defendant then continued to hit him, the court was told. 

After being shoved, Mr Maroof and his friend managed to push Masterson away and prevent him from launching another attack. He then fled onto a bus, the court heard.

The three men called 999 before getting into Mr Galloway's car to follow Masterson's bus, despite police telling them not to.

They then managed to flag down a passing patrol car which stopped the bus.

Officers arrested Masterson and seized a small amount of cannabis resin and a half empty bottle.

Miss Nelson said: 'George Galloway says he saw the defendant running towards him shouting 'You f****** b*****'. The others heard him saying words to that effect.

'Mr Galloway quickly realised the words were aimed at him and that he was about to be assaulted.

'He is 61 years of age and said the man appeared extremely aggressive and looked powerful and formed the view he intended to harm him.

'In an effort to protect himself, he put his hands across his face and felt a series of rapid blows to his face and torso and the defendant ranted as he did so.

'He says the defendant launched a Kung Fu kick at him, which he tried to block with his hand. 

'The defendant climbed on top of him and punched him about 10 times, mostly in the face but some to the upper and lower body.

'Throughout, he kept using profanities and George Galloway said he also heard the Holocaust mentioned, which led him to suspect that this might be a right wing extremist.

'The other men managed with great difficulty to pull him away and Mr Samir had to prevent him returning to Mr Galloway as the doctor helped him off the ground.'

Masterson carried out the attack on Goldborne Road while shouting 'I f****** despite you,' the court heard

Ms Nelson said Masterson admitted to police he said 'Anti-semitic little man, I f****** despise you' during the attack and described Galloway as 'a morally and intellectually bankrupt person'.

She added: 'The defendant said that he wanted to make Mr Galloway realise that his attitude towards Jews was shameful, it shames all Catholics and it shames anyone who has any idea of humanity.

'He felt he (Galloway) is a serpent in a way.'

She continued: 'He felt he was morally justified in assaulting Mr Galloway. He said he thought Galloway was a Nazi and his political views were hate.'   

Mr Galloway spent the night at St Mary's hospital in Paddington where tests revealed three bruises on his forehead, a swollen jaw, bruised ribs and a tender spine.

Mr Galloway is the MP for Bradford West and was formerly a member of the Labour party

He was given painkillers and discharged.

In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Galloway described how he has been constantly on his guard since the attack.

The statement read: 'I still have very painful ribs and take painkillers.

'Any warm embrace causes me pain, my left knee causes me great discomfort and I fear it will remain evermore.

'I am now on my guard when people meet me. It affects me, my lifestyle and my style of work.

'I never go anywhere alone, affecting my life. My family are in a constant state of worry and my seven-year-old son is worried and asks if I have my panic alarm to hand.

'My wife calls me and panics if I do not answer.'   

Mr Galloway is seeking help from the House of Commons and his party for the anxiety he now suffers, the court was told.

Miss Nelson described how, when interviewed under caution, Masterson said he had been on his way to a Sikh shop when he saw Mr Galloway with 'two confederates'.

He suddenly felt 'very, very angry' and ran, shouting, towards them, she said.

Miss Nelson told the court: 'He spoke at some length about the harassment the Jewish community suffers, saying they would leave and we will be left with a "very very vocal Islamic rump".

'He remembered knocking Mr Galloway's hat off and said "He dared not look at me" and "I saw fear in his eyes".'

She told how he spoke of 'knowingly, willingly and angrily' attacking the MP and added: 'I know it sounds pompous, but you know you are doing something right when your enemies are afraid'.

The court heard how Masterson told officers his motives for the 'frenzied' attack was 'to make him realise that this attitude to Jews was shameful and shames all Catholics'.

He had told police: 'I feel like he is a serpent in a way. He is opposed to Israel and anyone who is an enemy of Israel is an enemy of freedom in the country. We need to rip them from the earth.

'Galloway is like a henchman, he has got a fashionable cache that attracts people but I think I know his true character.'

Masterson is a full-time carer for a woman suffering from Crohn's disease, memory problems and an inflamed gall bladder.

Jonathan Mann, defending, said his client had a 'pathological loathing' of Mr Galloway but regretted what he had done after he 'calmed down'.

As well as imposing a jail term, Judge Aidan Marron QC ordered the defendant to pay £100. 

He said: 'Mr Galloway still suffers from real physical consequences as a result and equally significantly, still harbours real anxieties and concerns about venturing out to meetings and the like and takes security staff with him.

'That has a profound impact on his professional and social life.

'He is a public figure who has to do a lot of public work and is in the eyes of the public who might be vulnerable because of his views.'
