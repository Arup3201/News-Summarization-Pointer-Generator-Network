Team news 

Everton

John Stones could make an unexpected comeback for Everton in their Premier League clash with QPR on Monday.

The 20-year-old defender, who sustained an ankle injury against Manchester United on October 5, is back in training ahead of schedule and in contention for a place in the squad.

Steven Naismith, James McCarthy (both hamstring) and Darron Gibson (knee) will also be given a chance to prove their fitness, but midfielder Gareth Barry is suspended and Christian Atsu's hamstring injury is still being assessed.

Provisional squad: Howard, Coleman, Distin, Jagielka, Stones, Baines, Garbutt, McGeady, McCarthy, Gibson, Barkley, Osman, Mirallas, Lukaku, Hibbert, Pienaar, Besic, Naismith, Eto'o, Alcaraz, Kone, Oviedo.

Provisional squad: Green, McCarthy, Murphy, Traore, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Dunne, Caulker, Yun, Hill, Isla, Henry, Barton, Fer, Mutch, Phillips, Kranjcar, Hoilett, Vargas, Zamora.
