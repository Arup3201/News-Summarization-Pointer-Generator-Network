A new report says there has been ‘a rise in poverty in working families and a fall in workless and retired families'. File picture

One and a half million working families have been plunged into poverty since 2004 - the year that Eastern European migration began to accelerate, a major new study has found.

The majority of the people now living below the poverty line are not dependent on benefits but come from homes where at least one person has a job, the study reveals.

Almost half of the families who now count as poor have not one but two people in work, it said.

The large-scale study carried out for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found the fall of working families into poverty does not date from the beginning of the recession in 2008.

Instead, it reported that the remorseless rise of poverty among people who work for a living began in 2004.

Although the report does not attribute this to migration, the figure began to rise in the same year Tony Blair’s government opened the gates to allow migrants from Eastern European countries the right to work freely in Britain.

Since then the Eastern European population has shot up to around a million people, while high numbers of immigrants have continued to arrive from outside Europe.

Many of the new arrivals have been competing with lower-skilled workers in the existing population for low-paid jobs.

The report from Rowntree – which is headed by Julia Unwin, a Downing Street adviser when Gordon Brown was Prime Minister – said there had been ‘a dramatic change in who is most at risk of poverty compared to 10 years ago.’

It said there are ‘more people in poverty living in working families, meaning as many are now in working families as workless ones.’

And the report, Monitoring Poverty and Social Exclusion, added that there has been ‘a rise in poverty in working families and a fall in workless and retired families.

‘The rise occurred mainly in the middle of the last decade, when the number of people living in low-income working families rose from 5.2 million in 2003/04 to 6.8 million in 2008/09 before falling back slightly.’

Rowntree also found that 2.2 million children live below the poverty line in working families, while only 1.4 million live in homes where no-one has a job.

The Foundation’s economists said the study, which does not try to explain the rise in working poverty, ‘does not show that immigration has caused higher poverty’.

They suggested that changes to the benefit system were responsible for the lapse into poverty of a million and a half working people.

But a series of figures now points to a link between the arrival of Eastern European workers in large numbers beginning in April 2004 and the falling incomes and status of people who rely on earnings from the least skilled jobs.

The Rowntree report said that for the bottom 10 per cent of earners, ‘income at the 10th percentile peaked in 2004/05, well before the country went into recession, and fell quite consistently after that.’

The lowest incomes have fallen by eight per cent in real terms since 2004, it said.

In 2003/04 there were two million more people who were either living in homes where nobody works, or who were retired, listed as poor than people from working homes. However numbers were equal by 2008/09, and by 2011/12 there were more working poor than poor without jobs, according to the study.

The report also looked at overcrowding in both privately rented homes and those rented from local councils or state-financed housing associations. Less than five per cent of such homes were overcrowded in 2003/04, it found, but then numbers started rising, and topped seven per cent in state-subsised housing in 2010/11.

The poverty measure used by Rowntree is the commonly-used relative poverty measure, which says a family is poor if they live on less than 60 per cent of median income.

In the financial year 2012/13, this meant £130 for a single adult, £224 for a couple without children, £175 for a single parent with one child, and £364 for a couple with two children.

The relative measure is often criticised because it means that when average incomes fall, fewer people are said to be in poverty. However, it does chart accurately how different groups of people are doing compared to each other.

Since 2004, while large numbers of working families have slipped below the poverty line, the benefit system has buoyed up people who depend on welfare. Benefits continued to be uprated in line with inflation each year until 2011.

However, major reforms to the benefit system, such as the introduction of tax credits and pension credit, were introduced by Gordon Brown at the end of the 1990s, five years before large numbers of working people began to slip into poverty.

The MigrationWatch think tank said that it was no longer credible to deny the line between immigration and pressure on the incomes of lower earners.

Its chief Sir Andrew Green said: ‘Yet again, lobbyists seem to be in denial about the impact of a huge inflow of East European migrants on the lives of some of the poorer sections of our community.

‘It is surely no coincidence that starting from 2004, increases in working poverty and overcrowding in rental accommodation have gone hand in hand with increasing numbers of arrivals from the poorer parts of Eastern Europe.

‘The Government’s Migration Advisory Committee and academic research have already highlighted the impact on wages for the lowest paid.

‘As for jobs, nowhere in the Rowntree report is there a single mention of the fact that in the past 10 years the number of UK-born workers increased by just 25,000 while the number of migrants in work increased by over 2 million, with nearly a million from Eastern Europe.’

Chris Goulden, head of poverty research for the Rowntree Foundation, said that the drop of working families into poverty was linked to the introduction of tax credits by Gordon Brown in 1999. By 2004, he said, the credits were yielding ‘diminishing returns’ in terms of reducing poverty. He said other changes to the benefits system had also changed the balance of poverty in 2004 and 2005.

Mr Goulden said: ‘The report shows that pay slowed around 2004 and unemployment started to rise, although pay continued to grow even for low earners, while unemployment stayed low until 2008. It does not show that immigration has caused higher poverty.’

The Home Office Migration Advisory Committee found in a report on the impact of immigration in 2012 that ‘migrants are found to increase wages at the top of the UK wage distribution and to lower wages at the bottom of the distribution.’

A spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘Uncontrolled, mass immigration, of the kind we saw under the last government, makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on public services and forces down wages.

'It has both economic and social consequences. That is why our focus remains on reducing and controlling migration at sustainable levels.

‘We are creating a system that is fair to British citizens and those who want to come here legitimately and contribute to our national life, but which is tough on those who flout the rules. Since 2010, we have reformed benefits, healthcare and housing rules to make them among the tightest in Europe and we continue to see an increase in the number of British citizens in work.’

A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘The truth is, the percentage of people in the UK in relative poverty is at its lowest level since the mid-1980s and the number of households where no one works is the lowest since records began.

‘The Government’s long term economic plan is working to deliver the fastest growing economy in the G7, putting more people into work than ever before, and reducing the deficit by more than a third.’
