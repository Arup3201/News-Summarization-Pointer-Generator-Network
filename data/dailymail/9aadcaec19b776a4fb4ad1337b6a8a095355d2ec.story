Pleaded guilty: High school teacher and baseball coach pleaded guilty to sexual assault against a 15-year-old nearly 20 years ago 

A Vancouver high school teacher and baseball coach pleaded guilty on Thursday to abusing a 15-year-old boy nearly 20 years ago  when he was a pitcher on a minor league baseball team.

Eric Estes, 42, was living with the alleged victim's family in Maryland in 1997 while playing for Baltimore Orioles affiliates the Frederick Keys and the Bowie Baysox.

The alleged abuse took place between April and September of 1997. Estes would have been around 24 at the time. 

Oregon Live reports that Estes was put on paid administrative leave in May 2014 and that the school has begun the process of firing him following an investigation.

Estes was a teacher in the Vancouver school district for 14 years and taught social studies.

He was a teacher at Skyview High School for ten of those years and began coaching baseball there in 2006.

Estes entered his guilty plea in the Frederick Maryland Circuit Court and in exchange the prosecution dropped a third-degree sex offense to a second-degree offense.

Prosecutors are recommending that Estes serve three years of supervised probation and that he register as a sex offender. The conviction normally carries a maximum 15-year sentence.

The Frederick News-Post spoke Dave Ziedelis, general manager of the Frederick Keys, this June.

He said he had no other details about Estes' time in Frederick.

'Until very recently, I was not aware of the name Eric Estes,' Ziedelis said.

Minor league pitcher: Despite his pleading guilty to sexual assault the students of Eric Estes say they are shocked by the allegations and that they saw him as a father figure 

There have been no other reports of alleged sexual misconduct and students of Estes were deeply troubled by the allegations. 

Brooks Hanson, a former Skyview High School baseball player, told The Columbian that Estes was a great coach and it has been hard for him and others to pair the coach’s great personality and character with the criminal charges against him

'He has done more for me baseball-wise than, arguably, anyone,' Hanson said.

'I think it is a shame he is not going to be able to help kids like me anymore. It’s a sad situation on both sides.'

Former Skyview player Brian Valentine, who has known Estes for five years, said he was completely in shock about the sexual assault allegation and that he looked up to Estes like a father figure.

'He was a really good guy to everyone who passed through Skyview,' said Valentine.

'I’ve looked up to him and still do as a father figure, so when I heard about it, it was a really tough time for me.'
