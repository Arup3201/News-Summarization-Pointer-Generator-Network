Premier League target Sami Khedira says he is 'curious' to see where he will be playing next season as uncertainty continues to surround the Real Madrid midfielder's future.

The World Cup winner's contract expires at the end of the season while a host of European clubs including Chelsea, Arsenal and Bayern Munich have been linked with his signature.

However, the Germany international insisted that no clubs have been in contact with him and even hinted that he could sign a contract extension at the Bernabeu - despite having to compete with the likes of Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Asier Illarramendi for a place.

Speaking to reporters in Stuttgart, he said: 'It is a known fact that my contract expires. [The club and I] are always in good contact.

'I feel very comfortable in Madrid. I am not averse to staying. There are no talks with other clubs. I am curious myself to see where I will end up.'

The 27-year-old also admits he was not sure if he was going to make the World Cup Finals in Brazil - and said that the three-way tussle for the Ballon d'Or between Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Manuel Neuer is too close to call.

'It was a year full of events for me. I did not know whether I would be fit for the Champions League final and the World Cup again,' he said.

'The three nominees embody world class and are great personalities. For me, there are two favourites: Cristiano Ronaldo and Manuel Neuer. Both raised the level of their positions to a new dimension. 

'I am glad I do not have to vote. If I were [FIFA president] Sepp Blatter, I'd hand out golden balls.'
