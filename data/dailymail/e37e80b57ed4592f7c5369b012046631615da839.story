The sight of City and United players embracing before kick-off in Sunday’s derby may make Roy Keane wince, but ask Angel Di Maria to explain his attitude and it is clear warm hellos do not translate to soft minds.

Di Maria is one of five Argentines likely to start at the Etihad and having shared together a World Cup that came agonisingly close to ultimate glory, he believes a few handshakes can be forgiven.

‘When we see each other in the tunnel before games, I think it’s right to say “Hi” and greet each other - whether it’s an ex-team-mate or a good friend,’ reasons United’s record signing. ‘I think that’s normal, as long as you remember that you fight for the club and the shirt once the 90 minutes start. We must all remember there are no friendships out on the pitch.’

NINE South Americans are likely to feature in the Manchester derby. It would be more if Radamel Falcao was not injured.

ARGENTINA (5)

City: Sergio Aguero, Martin Demichelis, Pablo Zabaleta

United: Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo

BRAZIL (3)

City: Fernandinho, Fernando

United: Rafael

ECUADOR (1)

United: Antonio Valencia

That last statement is one Keane and all fans in either corner of Manchester can agree upon. ‘We know it’s a very important match for the city of Manchester,’ adds Di Maria. ‘We will be doing our absolute best to make sure the red half is happy at the end of the game.’

Di Maria, 26, should be joined by Marcos Rojo, with Pablo Zabaleta, Sergio Aguero and Martin Demichelis in opposition. They all live in the leafy outskirts of Manchester - Prestbury, Alderley Edge, Hale - but he has yet to go out for a meal with the men he reached the final in Brazil beside.

‘Sure if you do win there will be plenty of stick given out - and banter post match. But the real reason you want to give everything on the field in a game like this is so that your own fans go away happy.’

This is Di Maria’s first derby for his new team but he knows the intensity and fierce pride taken when two sides of a city collide. Rosario Central, his first club, share ferocious battles with Newell’s Old Boys situated little more than four miles away. Di Maria played in two; winning one, losing one.

‘Derby games can be a nightmare over there,’ he smiles. ‘If you lost it would be a case of not being able to go out - not just for two or three days but two or three games. Everyone would really suffer and didn’t want to show their faces to the fans. I know what it’s like when you have to keep your head down.’

Di Maria’s head should be up after a fine start to his United career following his £59.7million move from Real Madrid. He denies City made any direct attempts to get him.

‘There was never any contact anywhere else,’ he says. ‘The people who came with all the paperwork ready, showing real eagerness to sign me, were United. As soon as I heard of their interest, there was no question of me going anywhere else. I felt from the word go that I was going somewhere where I would be really loved.’

Di Maria is speaking before taking part in a kick-about with local kids as part of a joint initiative between the two clubs and the Premier League. Zabaleta is here also, and will probably be the defender tasked with shackling his compatriot come Sunday.

‘You need the perfect day to stop players like him,’ says Zabaleta. ‘I will try to play as good as I can. He’s quick and has a great technique. 

The Argentine then showed off a few of his best moves as the lucky youngsters stood back and admired

‘We’ve known each for many years. I was so happy when he signed for United because it was something good for him, he was really excited to come here and play in the Premier League.

‘He texted me when he was looking to move to Manchester to ask about the city, so I can help with some information.’

He believes had Di Maria recovered from his thigh injury in time for the World Cup final against Germany victory might have been found.

‘It would have made a big difference. They defended very solidly, very tight, and narrow. We needed quick players to play in counter-attack. Angel is one of those players who never stops running, never stops going forward, attacking the space. He’s just unbelievable.’

Zabaleta joke she may need to open an Argentine steakhouse to cater to the growing contingent but knows it is local pride as well as hard points at stake on Sunday.

‘It is the best team we can have now at the moment,’ he says. ‘It is a special game. It is the game everyone is looking at and waiting for.’

First-team players from both Manchester clubs were on hand to take part in a Premier League Kicks session between City in the Community and the Manchester United Foundation.
