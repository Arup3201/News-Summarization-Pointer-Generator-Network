Clive Goodman told Andy Coulson (pictured today outside court) how the Queen was 'upset' about officers eating the nuts in an email in 2005

The Queen was 'upset' about police officers eating nuts left out for guests before the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles, the trial into alleged phone hacking at the News of the World has heard.

She was so 'irritated' by officers eating the snacks she started marking the bowls to see when levels dropped, according to an email sent by Clive Goodman, former royal editor at the now-defunct Sunday tabloid newspaper.

A memo was sent to palace officers, telling them to 'keep their sticky fingers out', the Old Bailey heard.

In the email to former NotW editor Andy Coulson, which Mr Goodman had copied himself in, he wrote: 'The Queen is furious about police stealing bowls of nuts and nibbles left out for her in the apartments in the BP Queen's corridor.

'She has a very savoury tooth and staff leave out cashews, Bombay mix, almonds, etc. Prob is that police on patrol eat the lot.

'Queen is so narked she started marking the bowls to see when the levels dipped.'

He added: 'Memo now gone around to all Palace cops telling them to keep their sticky fingers out.'

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the jury that the Queen was 'upset' about the behaviour of the officers, according to Goodman’s email.

'Apparently they were helping themselves to nuts,' the barrister said.

'They were all being scoffed by police. That irritated Her Majesty apparently.'

In the email sent in March 2005, Goodman claimed he knew the printer doing the order of service for the Prince of Wales’s wedding to the Duchess of Cornwall and had a man checking out the wedding invitations, the jury was told.

'Only person to accept so far is Tony Blair,' he wrote.

In a separate message in March 2005, Goodman allegedly asked for payment for a phone book from Coulson.

'One of our Palace police is about to get his hands on the two Royal phone books', he said.

'They are enormously useful, we usually pay £1,000 each for them. They are very rare items.'

Goodman then emailed Coulson on May 14, 2005, allegedly telling him the books were now available to be bought, the court heard.

'Very risky document for him to nick', said Goodman.

'Ok to put the credit through?'

Mr Edis said: 'Mr Goodman appears to send it again on June 1, 2005, forwarded with a reminder.

'This does get a reply, half an hour later a single word "fine".'

Coulson is also on trial with news editor Ian Edmondson, 44, former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, 45, and former managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, for phone hacking.

Brooks is also accused of corrupt payments to public officials, and then engineering a cover-up with her husband Charlie, 50, former PA Cheryl Carter, 49, and News International head of security Mark Hanna when she was about to be arrested.

Brooks, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, Coulson, of Charing, Kent, Edmondson, of Raynes Park, south London, and Kuttner, of Woodford Green, Essex all deny of one count of conspiracy to intercept communications.

Brooks also denies two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office.

Coulson, with Goodman, of Addlestone, Surrey, also denies two counts of misconduct in a public office.

Carter, of Chelmsford, Essex, Hanna, of Buckingham, Buckinghamshire, and Charles Brooks, of Churchill, Chipping Norton, all deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

The trial continues.

Former News of the World news editor Ian Edmondson is 'currently unfit' and will take no further part in the trial over alleged phone hacking at the now-defunct newspaper, a jury has heard.

Edmondson, 44, was accused of conspiring to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006 while working at the former tabloid.

Mr Justice Saunders told the jury at the Old Bailey today: 'The consensus of opinion of doctors instructed both by the defence and the prosecution is that he is currently unfit.'

Edmondson, of Raynes Park, south west London, will be tried by a different jury at a later date, the court heard.

Mr Saunders said: 'I have received and read a number of medical reports about the fitness of Mr Edmondson to continue to participate in the current trial.'

He added: 'It is not anticipated that it will be long before he is fit to continue but it will be several weeks and there can be no guarantee that at the end of that period of time he will be fit.

'Bearing in mind the current estimate of the length of this trial, I do not think it is appropriate to adjourn to wait for his recovery and accordingly I shall discharge you from giving a verdict in his case.

'He will be tried by a different jury at a later date.'
