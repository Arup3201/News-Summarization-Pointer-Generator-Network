Atletico Madrid are finally ready to rubber-stamp Diego Costa's move to Chelsea as they ramp up their interest in Alvaro Negredo.

Costa is Jose Mourinho's No 1 transfer target this summer and the Blues have already met the striker's £32million buy-out clause.

But Chelsea fear Atletico are stalling on ratifying the move in hope of an improved offer from another club.

However, the Spanish club are now set to confirm Costa's switch to Stamford Bridge so they can focus on signing Manchester City's Negredo.

The Spaniard impressed during the opening months of last season but a loss of form saw him loss his place in Manuel Pellegrini's starting XI.

Atletico boss Diego Simeone wants Negredo to replace Costa, but knows the money recouped from the latter's move to England will be vital in securing the City forward.
