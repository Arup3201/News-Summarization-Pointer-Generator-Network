A woman who became known as 'Granny Canute' after moving into a cliff-edge caravan when her house fell into the sea has been given six months to evacuate the site. 

Bryony Nierop-Reading has been ordered by to vacate the mobile home she moved into when cliff erosion destroyed her three-bedroom bungalow in Happisburgh, Norfolk, in December 2013. 

Planning bosses at North Norfolk County Council say the caravan, which has sat in the 69-year-old's garden for 13 years, is not fit for residential purpose.

After turning down a compensation offer for the land in 2009, the grandmother-of-seven may be left homeless if evicted on August 25, as threatened.

While neighbours all accepted the £13,000 sum, Mrs Nierop-Reading couldn't bring herself to leave the house which she bought in 2008 after falling in love with its views of the North Sea. 

Having watched the bungalow being torn down, the pensioner says she is being  now being treated unkindly.

'I’m shocked and very angry. I can’t believe they are acting so harshly towards me,' Mrs Nierop-Reading said. 

'The council is being totally unfair and unreasonable. I cannot understand why I can’t stay here until the end of next year,” she insisted.

Mrs Nierop-Reading added she had hoped to remain on the land for two years. 

'I hope that by then I’ll have enough money to buy a home somewhere else in the village.'

Despite being offered compensation to leave the land in 2009, she claimed not enough help was offered by local authorities to residents whose homes are under threat from the environment.

The 69-year-old's three-bedroom bungalow was torn down by the council after part of the property was destroyed by a huge wave in December 2013 

A huge wave pulled the foundations from beneath part of the house, leaving Mrs Nierop-Reading's bathroom and parts of her bedroom hanging over the cliff

Mrs Nierop-Reading turned down the council's offer of compensation to leave the land in 2009, instead remaining hopeful she could spend more time in the house she fell in love with for its sea views

'The planning regulations were not framed to make allowance for people like me who lose their houses to the sea. 

'But it is going to happen more and more in the future so they need to start making the planning regulations more flexible and able to take account of environmental evacuees.'

Council leader Tom FitzPatrick said he had 'every sympathy' with people like Mrs Nierop-Reading who had been seriously affected by devastating erosion and dramatic storm damage.

In 1996, the property was some considerable distance from the cliff-edge 

But having refused to sell her bungalow to the council when approached, it would be, he said, 'not fair or consistent' to make special allowances for her case. 

Mrs Nierop-Reading said she will appeal the eviction notice, adding: 'I’m still convinced that it would have been immoral to have accepted a home from the council when I already had one and others were in greater need than me.' 

In 2008, Mrs Nierop-Reading bought the property for £25,000 while it was 20ft from the water's edge. 

A year later she was approached by council officials warning the house and those surrounding it would be swallowed by the sea. 

Her neighbours took their offer of £13,000 in compensation, but Mrs Nierop-Reading remained on the site. 

In 2012 she claims the erosion process was quickened by the council's removing of wooden revetment sea defences. 

The following year, a huge wave destroyed the ground beneath the bungalow's foundations, leaving her bathroom, pantry and part of her bedroom hanging over the cliff. 

Mrs Nierop-Reading, who is lives alone, was able to remove some of her possessions before the council tore down the rest of the house. 

Her battle against the raging sea led to her being dubbed Granny Canute after the 11th century king who claimed he had the power to hold back the sea. 

North Norfolk County Council did not comment on the issue this morning. 

In the years since she bought it for £25,000, the property was under threat from the receding cliff-edge
