Stephen Turnbull woke up in a hotel room in Bury in December, 2006 and switched on the television.

There it was – his picture on BBC World News. ‘I thought I was dreaming. Actually, I thought it was a nightmare,’ he recalls.

It wasn’t. Turnbull – on loan at Bury from Hartlepool United – had just helped the Shakers into the third round of the FA Cup following a 3-1 victory over Chester in a second-round replay.

The TV relayed the news: Bury have been expelled from the FA Cup after fielding an ineligible player.

‘It was me,’ says Turnbull. ‘There was a mix-up between the secretaries and I wasn’t registered. It was awful. We were in the third round.’

Six years on, Turnbull and seventh tier Blyth Spartans of the Northern League are very much in the third round – and once again it is the midfielder making the headlines.

It was against his former club Hartlepool at Victoria Park on Friday night – on a ground where he had never scored – that Turnbull curled home what Alan Shearer described as ‘the best free-kick I’ve ever seen’ to level the scores before he laid on the winning goal in the last minute for Jarrett Rivers.

‘I’d been practising them all week in training and couldn’t hit a barn door,’ laughs the 27-year-old, whose twin brother, Phil, plays for Gatsehead against Warrington in the second round this afternoon.

‘I said to Robbie Dale, “I’m going to hit this”. Never in my dreams did I think I’d catch it like I did. It didn’t just go in the top corner, it curled into the side-netting.

‘Afterwards, our manager, Tom Wade, said that Alan Shearer said it was the best free-kick he’d ever seen. Wow. That’s good enough for me.’

Turnbull’s goal, however, had merely made possible a replay at Croft Park. But the Spartans – one of the competitions most celebrated minnows who made it to the fifth round in 1978 – weren’t done there.

With the clock having ticked into the 90th minute, Turnbull found Rivers, the newsagent.

‘I gave him the ball, it was a good pass, and I just thought, “Go on, run at them”,’ he says.

That, he did. Jinking into the area, dropping his shoulder one way and throwing a step-over the other before firing into the back of the net.

‘Unbelievable,’ says Turnbull. ‘It was just incredible.’

It was all a far cry from Turnbull’s existence as an engineer on a P&O cruiseliner, where he spent five months in a boiler room earlier this year.

Turnbull's winning goal sparked jubilant celebrations from Blyth's fans as they reached the FA Cup 3rd round

‘I never thought I’d be scoring goals on the TV and playing in the third round of the FA Cup when I was stuck in that room at sea,’ he says.

‘I can’t wait for Monday’s draw – at least I know we’ll definitely be playing in it this time.’

Turnbull is back in the news, this time for all of the right reasons.
