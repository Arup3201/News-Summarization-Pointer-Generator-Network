One retailer has shed light on the powerful influence of the plus-size market on fashion brands.

ModCloth, which only launched larger sizes last year, says its plus-size offering now accounts for 8 per cent of sales because each plus-size customer will spend a significant amount more than their straight-size counterparts per order.

The label told the Wall Street Journal that 'new plus-size customers spend 25 per cent more per order, 
buy 17 per cent more items per order than regular-sized shoppers, and are 66 per cent 
more likely to spread the ModCloth gospel via social media.'

Samara Fetto, who heads up the brand's plus-size division says she believes plus sizes could generate even more significant sales than regular sizes in the future.

'Our small-medium-large customer has other options for retailers who 
can steal a portion of her wallet,' she told the paper. 'For plus, her options are much more 
limited.'

Indeed, the average woman in the U.S. is around a size 14, however most mainstream fashion labels' largest size is a 12, presenting a gaping hole in the market.

But while there is certainly a demand for affordable, cool clothes for the larger woman, relatively few brands have cashed in on it because the design and manufacturing process requires specialist skill.

This issue was addressed by Brandon Wen and Laura Zwanziger, both apparel
design sophomores at Cornell University, whose research revealed that plus-size women account for 28 per cent of 
fashion purchasing power in the U.S., but their spending only contributes to 17 per cent of sales.

The pair 
created a realistic size 24 dress form after they could not find an 
appropriate mannequin on which to base designs for larger women.

'A lot 
of the clothes [for plus-size women] are really just sized up from 
smaller proportions, which fit really strangely,' Miss Zwanziger said. 'Plus-size women feel alienated from the fashion industry.'

ModCloth is not the only label to have taken action in appealing to the plus-size market. Mango announced last week that it would be launching a plus-size collection, while fashion blogger Gabi Gregg's first 
'fatkini' collection in sizes 10 to 24 for Swimsuits For All, sold out within hours of going on sale in May — to the frustration of thousands of 
eager fans.

And H&M was applauded recently for casting U.S. size 12 model Jennie Runk in a swimwear shoot, without labeling the final images with the term 'plus-size'.

'Her section isn't labeled "Plus-Size Beachwear" — it's just beachwear, period,' writes Jezebel's Jenna Sauers.

'I think it sends a positive message 
about inclusivity and changing standards of beauty to have a plus-size 
girl all over the landing page www.hm.com/us/beachwear. Not 
/plussizebeachwear! Just /beachwear,' she explains.

'Seeing plus-size bodies in fashion spreads and ads should be as common as seeing anything else.'
