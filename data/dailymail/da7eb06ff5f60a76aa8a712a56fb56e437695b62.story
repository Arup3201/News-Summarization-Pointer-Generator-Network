A couple who killed their severely disabled son in an 'act of love' have been found dead at their home in western Sydney.

Margaret and Raymond Sutton, who were placed on good behaviour bonds over the death of their 28-year-old son Matthew in 2001, were discovered at their Leonay home, near Penrith, on Saturday about 11am after concerns were raised.

Aged 67 and 70 respectively, police are not looking for anyone else in connection with their deaths and detectives are investigating whether the couple took their own lives at their Pleasant Place home.

Margaret and Raymond Sutton, who were placed on good behaviour bonds over the death of their 28-year-old son Matthew in 2001, were discovered at their Leonay home, near Penrith, on Saturday morning

A NSW Police spokeswoman said the bodies were yet to be formally identified, and a post mortem was expected to be conducted next week.

Mr and Mrs Sutton's son Matthew had been born with no eyes, mostly deaf and had severe mental disabilities with the mental age of a child aged three or four.

They killed Matthew in April 2001 on the eve of an operation for an ear infection that would have likely robbed him of any remaining ability to hear, sense of taste and limited powers of speech.

Matthew lived in a nearby home for the disabled at Katoomba, in the Blue Mountains and was killed while visiting his parents at their Leonay home.

During the couple's 2007 hearing, Mrs Sutton told the NSW Supreme Court that Matthew loved music and the prospect of him not being able to listen to it had troubled her deeply.

Mr and Mrs Sutton admitted the killing in 2005 and in 2007 a judge said the couple's decision to end Matthew's life was 'born of love for him'

At a previous inquest, Mrs Sutton said hearing was Matthew's only link to the outside world and the operation would have left him with no quality of life.

Matthew's tragic death and the ensuing court case divided public opinion at the time.

Mr and Mrs Sutton faced up to 25 years in jail after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Matthew.

The couple admitted the killing in 2005 and in 2007 they were placed on five-year good behaviour bonds, with a judge saying no further sentence could add to their suffering.

Supreme Court Justice Graham Barr said at the time that the couple devoted their lives to their son's care and that their decision to end his life was 'born of love for him'.

The court heard Mrs Sutton gave Matthew a sedative before her husband 'released him from this world'.

Mr Sutton never revealed how he killed Matthew and an autopsy failed to establish a cause of death although toxicology reports found traces of the sedatives.

After the sentence was handed down, Mr and Mrs Sutton's lawyer Tony Bellanto said the couple would suffer for the rest of their lives.

'I don't think I've ever come across a case that touched the emotions as this one did,' Mr Bellanto said in 2007.

'They (the Suttons) will never be able to completely move away from what's happened.

'They are coping of course but they will be suffering for the rest of their lives.'

It remains unclear how Mr and Mrs Sutton died but police confirmed no one else was involved.

'Whatever has happened we think it has happened inside the home between the two of them - but we don't know yet,' a police spokeswoman said.

Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with their deaths and detectives are investigating whether the couple, aged in their late 60s, took their own lives at their Pleasant Place home in Leonay

Matthew was the Sutton's second son, born after Mrs Sutton experienced five miscarriages

Out of desperation for another child, Mrs Sutton revealled during the the couple's hearing that she had a stitch in her womb to prevent miscarrying Matthew.

She also told the court about her concerns after a series of violent assaults on Matthew by another disabled resident at the home in Katoomba.

Despite speaking to the Department of Community Services (now Family and Community Services) about the violence.

'(The department said) They would teach him self-defence over the phone,' she said, adding that Matthew did not know what a phone was.

Mrs Sutton said it troubled her to think she was taking Matthew back into a 'hostile environment'.Â 

At the time Mr Bellanto told the court the public 'would understand the need for compassion and the need for mercy in a case such as this'.

During the sentencing, Mrs Sutton wept as Justice Barr read from a court statement in which she asked: 'How could we subject our precious son to what was ahead?

'With all the love we had for Matti we ... we released him from any more pain and suffering.'

Before the couple confessed to police in 2005, listening devices in their home recorded Mr Sutton saying: "It's because there is no euthanasia"

Penrith Police and forensic investigators established a crime scene and are continuing their investigations.
