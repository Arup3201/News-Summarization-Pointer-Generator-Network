Problems with a conveyor system designed to haul rafts to the top of the world's tallest water slide have forced officials to cancel two scheduled media sneak preview days and could delay the ride's official opening for the third time.

National and local media members were scheduled to take rides Thursday and Friday on the 17-story, 168-foot-tall Verruckt water slide, but Schlitterbahn Waterpark spokeswoman Winter Prosapio said glitches last weekend with the conveyor hadn't been resolved in time for that to happen.

There's a chance the Kansas City, Kansas, attraction will be ready for operation on Sunday - more than a month after it had been slated to open May 23 - as long as the issues have been ironed out, she said.

'When we had problems this weekend, we flew in parts, flew in people, flew in all kinds of stuff,' Prosapio said Wednesday. 'Crews are still working toward Sunday. That's still our goal.'

No risks: A spokeswoman for the waterpark said they'd rather face embarrassment than risk injuries

Verruckt, which means 'insane' in German, was certified as the world's tallest water slide in April by Guinness World Records.

The slide sends riders on four-person rafts plummeting at 60 to 70 mph.

The ride's official opening date was moved from the May date to June 5 to allow for more testing, then pushed back again to June 29.

Prosapio said park officials would not hesitate to delay operation for however long it takes to make sure the slide is safe.

'We'll take embarrassment before putting someone in the slide when it is not ready,' she said.

Sunday's opening would coincide with a one-hour special on the Travel Channel titled 'Xtreme Waterparks' documenting the designing and building of Verruckt.

world's tallest, steepest and fastest water ride when it opens

'Game changer': The 17-storey drop will beat the current record of 134.5ft held by a Brazilian slide

A promotional video for the show 
includes footage of two men riding a raft down a half-size test model of
 the slide and going slightly airborne as it crests the top of the first
 big hill.

The conveyor 
system hauls the 100-pound rafts to the top of the slide because 'that's
 not something you can have guests carry up 264 steps,' Prosapio said.

The
 Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, 
inspected the ride to make sure it was structurally sound but is not 
responsible for the safety of riders, Unified Government spokesman Edwin
 Birch said.

'There are very few, if any, rules in the state of Kansas regulating amusement parks and rider safety,' Birch said.

Prosapio said the water slide is still in the manufacturing phase and 'hasn't been handed over as a completed project.'

Park owners have high hopes for the ride, which they anticipate becoming a destination attraction.

The
 opening of a second highly anticipated ride in the area, SteelHawk at 
Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Missouri, also has been delayed.

Under construction: The slide was due to open in May but that still hasn't happened

Thrilling: Once at the bottom of the huge drop, riders are then sent up a second five-storey hill

The ride, which spins people around a 301-foot tower, was supposed to open last month.

In
 announcing the delay in the scheduled May 24 opening, a park spokesman 
attributed the setback to bad weather and said the ride would open 
within a few days.

A Worlds of Fun spokeswoman didn't immediately return a call Wednesday afternoon seeking comment.

In January, the makers of the giant 17-storey water slide released a terrifying promotional video of the new ride.

When they finally get to ride Verruckt, thrill-seekers will be sent down in four-person inflatable rafts at more than 65mph.

Bosses at the Kansas City water park Schlitterbahn promised their ride will become the world's tallest, fastest and steepest.

The video showed vertigo-inducing pictures of the giant slide being built on site.

The slide's drop is so steep, it is almost at a right-angle to the ground. 

Thrill-seekers will need to climb 264 steps to reach the top where they will wait on a deck made from railroad tanker cars.

They will then be sent hurtling down into the pool below. 

Before the Verruckt, the record holder for tallest water slide was the 134.5ft Insano slide in Fortaleza, Brazil. 

Larry
 Pitcher, the park's director of marketing and sales, told The Kansas 
City Star in January: 'We have always been family friendly, but this 
will attract those adrenaline junkies who are always looking for that 
next biggest, coolest thrill.'

The rafts will drop more than 130ft before being sent up another five-story tall hump and then down again into the pool.

Mr Pitcher said: 'At Schlitterbahn we 
love rides that encourage people to share the experience. Besides it’s 
more fun if someone is screaming in your ear.'

The ride was designed by Schlitterbahn co-owner Jeff Henry who said it will be a 'game changer' for the industry.

He has also created pioneering rides including the uphill water slide.
