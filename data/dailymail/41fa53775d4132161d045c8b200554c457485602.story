A baby died after his brain was starved of oxygen when midwives failed to notice he had been born under his mother’s bed sheets.

Maninder Singh was overlooked because his mother Geeta had been given a double-strength epidural and could not feel anything below her waist.

He was found ‘looking blue’ eight hours after she was induced.

The boy suffered a catastrophic brain injury in the delay and died six months later.

Mother Geeta, 32, died the following year from complications giving birth to her second child.

Yesterday
hospital bosses agreed to pay a five-figure out-of-court settlement 
after admitting responsibility for the boy’s death in May 2009.

Last
night his father Kamaljeet, 35, criticised the hospital which 
repeatedly refused to admit liability and apologise before  accepting 
they were at fault in April.

This has been an extremely difficult four 
years for my family,’ he said.

‘My wife died never knowing what happened (or) that anyone was sorry for our loss.

‘We lost a much loved son under horrific circumstances.

‘We fought so hard and waited so long to receive an apology and an admission that more could have been done to save him.

‘No
amount of money could ever replace what we have lost but we are now 
finally in a position to move forward with our lives. We feel that in 
some small way justice has been done.’

Mrs
Singh, who suffered from diabetes, anaemia and a range of other health 
problems during her pregnancy, was flagged as a ‘high risk’ case when 
she was admitted to St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester in October 2008.

Although she was 34 weeks pregnant, doctors decided to induce the baby after becoming concerned his growth had slowed.

An
inquest into Maninder’s death, in April, was told that Mrs Singh was 
given an epidural several hours into her labour for the pain, but a 
consultant anaesthetist agreed to first perform a ‘spinal block’ so she 
would sit still enough to have the epidural needle inserted.

This amounted to a double dose of pain relief, the coroner was told.

But
midwives failed to regularly monitor Mrs Singh and when they went to 
attach a foetal scalp electrode they pulled back the bed covers and 
discovered Maninder had been born.

Mrs
Singh’s sister Rekha  told the inquest: ‘When I looked round at the bed
the cord was stretched down and the baby was between her legs and was 
blue.’

Although Maninder was born with some medical problems, the delay in resuscitation caused avoidable brain damage.

An internal investigation concluded that staff at St Mary's Hospital failed to communicate effectively during handovers, failed to fully acknowledge and respond to Mrs Singh's medical needs and failed to properly and regularly assess the progress of her labour. Mr Singh has now reached an out-of-court settlement

Coroner
Nigel Meadows delivered a narrative verdict and listed eight failings 
by the hospital, including a failure to recognise the baby was in 
distress, delay in summoning a senior doctor and a failure to 
effectively monitor and examine Mrs Singh properly.

Yesterday,
Mr Singh’s solicitor, Sharon Williams, said it was unacceptable that 
the hospital had waited four years before admitting they were to blame.

Kathryn
Murphy, of St Mary’s Hospital said: ‘We have recognised there were 
failings surrounding the care of Maninder Singh and accept that this 
fell below the level we normally provide.’

Delay in staff noticing and acting to resuscitate him meant he suffered further avoidable injury, an inquest heard

Tragically, Mrs Singh has since died, just
months after the birth of the couple’s second child in January 2010, from multiple organ failure
