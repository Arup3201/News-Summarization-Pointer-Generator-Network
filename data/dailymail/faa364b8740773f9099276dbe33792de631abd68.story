Bomb disposal experts rushed to the aid of a man who accidentally fired an entire undetonated grenade into his leg.

The unnamed 62-year-old and two paramedics were held outside UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, fearing for their lives from 11pm to 7am on Friday as experts warned one move could kill them all.

It was not until dawn that the team decided a disposal specialist could attempt to remove the device - which has a range of 350 meters. 

Emergency: A 62-year-old man was held in an ambulance outside UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, for eight hours after firing an entire grenade into his leg. ER and surrounding streets were closed off to the public

According to doctors in Jasper, Alabama, the man had arrived at his local clinic bleeding profusely, saying he mistook a genuine bomb for a novelty one and hit it with a hammer.

It was not until he was en route to the state's top trauma center that doctors realized it was not a piece of shrapnel but the actual 40mm grenade - which has a 350-meter range. 

The weapon had failed to detonate because it did not travel far enough when it became lodged. 

For the next eight hours, from 11pm to 7am, the man was held inside the ambulance on the street outside UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama.

The entire surrounding area was closed off to the public and people were barred from entering ER.

At dawn, the team decided to send in a  U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal specialist out of Fort Benning to remove the device in a 30-minute procedure that could have killed dozens.

'It was pretty nerve-wracking. It was an intense experience,' said paramedic Cameron Padbury, 37, who had to stay in the ambulance with the patient all night.

He told AL.com: 'From what they were telling us, if he moved the right way it could go off and we could all die.

'We parked outside the ER with everything barricaded off.

'They had us stationed where it would cause minimal damage and no civilian casualties in case it went off. Only those of us in the ambulance might die.'

The team, he said, tried to play down the gravity of the situation but the patient was becoming enraged that he could be taken into the hospital.

Eventually they explained: 'We told him that he really did have an actual grenade in his leg. 

'We were told the only reason it didn't go off was because it didn't rotate enough times or go enough distance.'

'He got pretty upset. He understood there was a possibility he might not make it through.

'He asked us to contact his family, and we did. We left messages for them.'

At 7am, when the unit opted to remove the device, Padbury was given the option to leave, but he chose to stay. 

'The EOD gave us body armor to put on inside the ambulance while we removed the object,' he said. 'We stayed with him.' 

Experts have praised Padbury and his colleague for their bravery.

'The Jasper paramedics stayed with the guy all night and saved his life,' said Dave Hyche, a Birmingham supervisor with the firearms and explosives bureau. 'Had it been a high explosive, it could have taken that ambulance apart.'

'It was extremely heroic,' Hyche said. 'Nobody knew this wasn't live. Removing it could have easily killed everyone there.'
