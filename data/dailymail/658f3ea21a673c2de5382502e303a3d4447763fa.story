You wait years for a decent sighting of the legendary ape-like creature known as Bigfoot, and then two come along at once.

The fascinating photographs, taken just two weeks ago near Bradford, Pennsylvania, appear to show a pair of Bigfoots, or perhaps that should be Bigfeet, wandering through the trees.

Keen hiker John Stoneman claims he spotted the seven-foot-tall beasts just yards from a main road through trees in Kinzua State Park.

Two beasts: Stoneman claimed this image, taken just two weeks ago near Bradford, Pennsylvania, showed two of the mysterious creatures known as Bigfoot wandering through the woods

Is it Bigfoot? John Stoneman's close up photo, pictured, apparently shows one of the 'beasts' spotted just yards from a main road through trees in Kinzua State Park

Lurking: The photographs were taken by keen hiker John Stoneman who was on his way home with his girlfriend from a festival with his girlfriend when the pair spotted the mysterious shape moving in the forest

Mr Stoneman, 57, had been returning 
from the Kinzua Bridge Fall Festival with his girlfriend when the pair 
saw the mysterious shape moving in the forest.

He quickly grabbed his camera and fired off these shots as they slowed the car down and edged along the road.

Traffic
 backing-up behind his vehicle forced John to move on but not before he 
got what he believes is some of the best evidence yet of the existence 
of the legendary North American creature.

Debate: Stoneman's photographs fueled the debate on whether the legendary creature actually exists

Mr Stoneman, from Bradford, PA, said: 'I'm a sceptic myself, I'm not a believer, but this was not a bear and you can see fur on it.

'It's
 wider at the shoulders and tapers down whereas a bear is bigger in the 
middle and stands differently with its paws out, this was standing like a
 man, like a Bigfoot.

'At first some people have 
discredited it and said it's just a root ball at the bottom of a fallen 
tree, but I've been back to the exact spot and there is no root ball 
there.

'We do have black bears, but they are considerably smaller than this, it was standing about seven-foot tall.'

The day before the sighting John said there had been a 'Bigfoot calling contest' organised as part of the bridge festival - an event held annually in the area to commemorate an old viaduct destroyed by a tornado.

He said: "This was 200 yards from the road, it was too narrow for me to be able to pull over without stopping traffic but I got as many pictures as I could.

'I actually dropped the camera casing so I couldn't see what I had got until I got home and put them on my computer, I was surprised at what I saw.

'I looks more like a bigfoot than anything else, I've already had organisations asking me to send them copies for verification.'

Mr Stoneman - who is a member of the local outdoor pursuits group Allegheny Outdoor Adventures - said he had never seen anything like it in the woods before.

Location: Outdoorsman John Stoneman, pictured, said he was previously a skeptic but the strange 'creature' convinced him

The quiet spot where the two 'bigfoots' were seen. Photographer John Stoneman fired off several shots. He said he was 'surprised' when he arrived home and saw the pictures close up

He said: 'This area is known for 
Bigfoot sightings but this is the first time I have seen anything like 
this, I am in the woods every week, I hunt and go hiking.

'I went back to the exact spot where it had been and there was nothing there, just years and years of leaves on the floor.'

It
 comes as researchers told a new conference in Texas that they have 
proof Big foot is real and have even collected DNA samples.Â 

The Sasquatch Genome Project has spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years.

Bigfoot, also known as sasquatch, is the name given to an ape-like creature that some people believe inhabits forests, mainly in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid.

In 1951 American Eric Shipton photographed what he described as a Yeti footprint beginning a spate of 'sightings' and print finds throughout the 20th and 21st century.
