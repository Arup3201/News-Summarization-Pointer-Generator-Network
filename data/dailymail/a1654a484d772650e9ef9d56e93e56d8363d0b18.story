A group of sailors on a US Navy carrier watch in awe as the jet puts on a show and flies right by the vessel. 

The phenomenon — which appears as a tail of air behind a fast-flying jet —  occurs when pilots break the speed of sound.

It is accompanied by an incredible noise as sound waves from the jet compress at the tail o fthe plane.
