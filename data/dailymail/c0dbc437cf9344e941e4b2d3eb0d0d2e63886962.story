Some people make signs. Others organize marches. And occasionally people stage sit-ins to express their grievance with a business or government institution.

But a Brooklyn man has gone a very different route: To protest a shortage of subway trains going from Manhattan to Brooklyn, Julian Cole has made a life-size mold of his entire body, covered it head-to-toe in wrapping paper and left it in one of Brooklyn's busiest subway stations.

Cole describes his installation as a 'friendly reminder' that the population in Brooklyn is growing at record pace, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is not meeting the demands of the growing population.

L-Train: Brooklynite Julian Cole is using this life-sized - gift-wrapped - mold of himself to protest a shortage of subway trains

'Dear MTA, Merry Christmas! Here's a present I am sure you are looking forward to opening. Add this one to the other 60,000 presents who have moved into the borough in the last 2 years! Best of luck with those extra trains services. Love, Brooklyn,' Cole wrote on a card attached to the gift-wrapped mold of his body.

As Gothamist reports, Cole also made headlines in the summer of 2012 for a project he did titled L Degrees, a website that predicted the temperature on each platform of the subway's L train, which runs from lower Manhattan into Brooklyn.

'Over the past month I have been recording the temperature at the different platforms and the above ground temperature,' Cole said of his project at the time. 'I came to a fairly accurate system which has allowed me to pull in the localized weather from Yahoo Weather for the different neighborhoods and add a weighting system for the temperature at the platforms.

Reminder: Cole left this Christmas card on the mold, reminding the MTA of Brooklyn's increasing population

'On the tests that I have been doing it has been accurate to a couple of degrees around 80% of the time. However, like the weather, sometimes there are some things you cant account for that may affect the weather.'

As for his latest installment, Cole should be happy to know that the MTA has promised to add more trains to the L line during peak times.
