Outrage: Stephanie Rice poses in the designer bikini deemed 'too revealing'

An Australian Olympic swimmer has been criticised for posing in a bikini deemed 'too revealing' - but has started a copycat craze of people wearing the outfit.

Triple gold medalist Stephanie Rice posted the picture of her in a two-piece designer swimsuit on Twitter earlier this week.

The bikini - known as the 'tomb raider' - had been given to her as a birthday present from the designer Ellie Gonsalves.

But critics blasted for the sports star for showing off in the costume which some claimed was 'too sexy'.

One fan tweeted: 'Stephanie Rice posting a photo of herself in swimwear has brought disgrace to the Australian swim team and she should be dropped.'

Despite the public backlash, Miss Rice left the photo on her Instagram page.

There were also claims that by posing in the swimsuit she could have breached a sponsorship contract with Speedo.

However, her management denied that she had broken any rules.

A spokesman said: 'No, Stephanie isn't an ambassador for Ellie Gonsalves, she just loves their stuff.

'She doesn't have any relationship with Speedo anymore so there are no restrictions there.'

Despite some criticism, the picture sparked a string of spoofs with men posting pictures of themselves in the same costume. Many of the them were supporting the swimmer.

Radio presenter Ryan Fitzgerald contacted the makers of the bikini and was sent one to wear. He put the picture online of him and friend Michael Wipfli wearing the swimsuit.

The outfit's designer Ellie Gonsalves also posted a picture of herself in the costume to show support for her athlete friend.

Ellie Gonsalves label director Vanessa Bryce said that sales of the bikini have soared since Miss Rice's picture was made public.'We've had inquires from all over - the US, Singapore. We've sold an extra 60 since the photo ran and sales of other swimwear has also gone up,' she told the Herald Sun.

'Yes, we are preparing a special package of things to send (Rice) after the Olympics to say thank you', she added.

The controversy is the latest to hit the 
swimmer, who won three golds at Beijing in 2008 and is the world record 
holder for the women's 400m individual medley.

In 2008, Miss Rice sparked outrage when a picture of her posing in a skin-tight police costume appeared on her Facebook page.

And
in September 2010 she was slammned she wrote 'suck on that faggots' 
after Australia beat South Africa in a Rugby Union match. Miss Rice was 
criticised for the comments and made a tearful public apology.

The latest outrage comes just days 
after two of Australia's male swimmers posed with guns for a picture 
that was posted on Facebook.

The
image, taken in a gun shop in Santa Clara, California, showed Nick 
D'Arcy with two pistols standing next to Kenrick Monk who is holding two
shotguns across his chest.

The photo was removed after condemnation from Swimming Australia. A spokesman said: 'Swimming Australia does not condone the posting of inappropriate content on Facebook, Twitter or any social media platform.'

Mr D'Arcy said the picture was meant as a 'bit of fun'

'If anyone's been offended I deeply apologise. It was never the intent, it was never supposed to be offensive,' he said according to 9News.

D'Arcy is a medal hope in the 200m butterfly in London, while Monk will compete in the 200m freestyle and Australia's 4x200m freestyle relay team.

Unorthodox: The bizarre photograph might raise more questions about how the the Australian swimming team handles its public relations with images

In slightly more appropriate pictures, four more of Australia's male swimmers posed in the sea for a photoshoot.

Eamon Sullivan, James Roberts, James Magnussen and Matt Targett posed for the pictures on Manly Beach in Sydney.

But questions were raised over the bizarre shots which show the men looking towards the sky, and lining up behind each other.
