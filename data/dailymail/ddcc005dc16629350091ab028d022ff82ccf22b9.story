A scandal-hit crime tsar has been accused of wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds on a new office and boosting her image while police officers are losing their jobs.

Ann Barnes, notorious for employing a foul-mouthed teenager as her youth adviser, has spent almost £200,000 on moving her office less than two miles, and only revealed the costs after an investigation by The Mail on Sunday.

Her new base includes a state-of-the-art studio for radio interviews – even though there is already one used by police chiefs yards away on the same site.

The independent Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent has spent more than £7,500 on consultants to improve her ‘brand’ and taken control of Kent Police’s press office despite fears the move will jeopardise its independence.

Insiders have also revealed allegations of ‘diva-like’ behaviour by Mrs Barnes, including throwing a ‘hissy fit’ when the force’s chief constable appeared on television instead of her.

She has even fallen out with police chiefs by parking her battle bus, which she grandly calls Ann Force One, in disabled bays at the force HQ.

Last night one senior source said: ‘She is deeply unpopular in the force, and people say her office is a horrible place to work. There was a lot of unease in Kent Police about the money spent on her office when people are losing their jobs.’

Another insider added: ‘It’s all about “me me me” with her. She just gets people’s backs up.’

Cllr Rupert Turpin, vice-chairman of the Kent Police and Crime Panel which scrutinises the PCC, said: ‘The public will be mystified as to how the rhetoric of leaving no stone unturned to save the jobs of front line officers has turned into the reality of no-expense-spared office moves, duplicating radio studios and expensive media consultancy. Perhaps the media consultants can advise Mrs Barnes to come clean to the people of Kent about her excessive expenditure.’

Her foul aide: Our story last year

Mrs Barnes, paid £85,000 a year, was elected as the first PCC in Kent in November 2012 despite previously branding the Government’s plan to increase police accountability a ‘wilful waste of money’.

She became the most high-profile of the country’s 41 crime tsars a year ago when The Mail on Sunday revealed her £15,000 youth commissioner, Paris Brown, 17, had posted a series of highly offensive comments online.

Mrs Barnes is in charge of a single pot of money that must pay for her own office and Kent Police, and chiefs have warned that as many as 100 extra officer posts could be lost when £20million is cut from the budget in 2015-16.

Yet last August, Mrs Barnes moved her staff from her old Police Authority offices in central Maidstone to Kent Police headquarters on the outskirts of the town – 1.8 miles away.

Sources in the force claim she was offered use of a building at one end of the complex, but refused because it was next to a parade of takeaway food shops.

‘She wasn’t going to have that because they would be able to smell the chips,’ one source said.Instead, she uprooted the firearms licensing team to take over its rooms, and had a new public entrance built to her office complete with signs, new doors and expensively refurbished sash windows.

Inside her office, Mrs Barnes had a soundproofed studio constructed complete with the latest ISDN connections so she could do live radio interviews – even though there is an identical facility yards away in the control room of the police HQ site.

Although the move took place last summer, Mrs Barnes is paying rent on her old offices in Gail House –£59,000 a year – until this June.

But despite being required by law to publish all her spending on items costing more than £500, the details were not made public until this newspaper asked questions about them this week.

The only related expenditure listed on Mrs Barnes’s website, until this weekend, was £1,408 paid to a local removals firm.

On Friday evening, after The Mail on Sunday asked a series of detailed questions about Mrs Barnes’s spending, she published an article on her website titled: ‘Public money set to be saved after office move.’

She said: ‘Had I renewed the Maidstone office contract it would have been one of the most expensive buildings on the police estate. I just couldn’t justify this during times of police cuts.

‘The move from Maidstone town centre to the excess space at Kent Police HQ will save around £250k over the next five years, and even more in the years after that.’

Mrs Barnes claimed the move cost £150,000 excluding VAT – so with the tax added it would reach £180,000, not including the continued rent on the old building or the construction of the radio studio.

A spokesman for Mrs Barnes declined to comment on the allegations about her behaviour, saying: ‘These are based on hearsay.’
