Trial: Justin Lee Collins (pictured today) arrives for the second day of his trial where he was accused of trying to push his ex-girlfriend in front of a taxi

TV star Justin Lee Collins tried to 
push his girlfriend in front of a taxi on a night out with his friend, 
comedian Alan Carr, a court heard yesterday.

Collins, 38, is accused of subjecting 
Anna Larke to a campaign of verbal and physical abuse during a 
nine-month relationship last year.

It is claimed he forced Miss Larke to 
sleep facing him and ordered her to throw away DVDs featuring actors she
found attractive and compile a dossier of her former lovers.

A jury has been told Miss Larke, 38, 
is a recovering alcoholic with a history of depression.

Sonia Woodley, 
QC, defending at St Alban’s Crown Court, said Miss Larke had told 
Collins about three suicide attempts including an occasion when she 
threw herself in front of a taxi.

But giving evidence yesterday, Miss 
Larke insisted Collins had tried to push her in front of the car during a
drunken night out with Carr, his former co-host on The Friday Night 
Project.

She said: ‘No. He [Collins] tried to push me in front of a car when he was drunk out of his head.

‘I was with him and Alan Carr. We were walking down the street and he was shoving me and pushed me into traffic.

‘He pushed me in front of a car. I was lucky a man who was walking along caught me before I fell in front of the cab.’

Miss Woodley asked: ‘Alan Carr can confirm this can he?’

Former PR girl Miss Larke said: ‘He was drunk too, but yes. I stayed at his house that night. It was quite an evening.’

Miss Larke also denied she had 
attempted suicide on two other occasions claiming she had lied to stop 
Collins asking questions about her past.

She said: ‘He asked me what the worst thing I’d ever done was and I did tell him I’d tried to commit suicide.

‘I told him to stop him from  asking me things and writing them down.’

Court: Miss Larke, left, was accused of trying to commit suicide and she told the court that comedian Alan Carr was with her and Collins when Collins tried to push her in front of a car on a drunken night out

Couple: Collins pictured in 2011 with his former girlfriend Miss Larke, 38, after he split from his wife Karen

The court has been told how Collins 
left his wife in January 2011 and moved from Bristol to live with Miss 
Larke in a flat in Kew, west London.

Under cross-examination, Miss Larke 
admitted Collins had showered her with gifts including a laptop, digital
camera and diamond ear rings.

'Bruises': Miss Larke claimed she had not shown them to her GP because she didn't want to 'grass up' Collins who was 'the love of [her] life'

She also told how Collins had paid for
her to take three months off work as a Christmas present and had taken 
her on ‘expensive and luxurious’ holidays.

Asked why he had bought the computer, 
Miss Larke – who gave evidence from behind a curtain – said: ‘I imagine 
it’s because he was very guilty. He also abused my cat, he’s an animal 
abuser as well.’

Miss Larke also claimed Collins bought her clothes, 
including a $1,000 leather dress from New York, because he wanted to 
control what she wore.

She said he had abused her for being 
overweight calling her a ‘fat, ****ing dog’ and said she was ‘riddled 
with cellulite’.

The jury of nine women and three men was told Miss 
Larke went through menopause at the age of 36 and ‘despised herself’ 
because she couldn’t give Collins children.

Miss Larke said Collins had given her 
‘thousands’ of bruises’ and some could be seen in pictures taken of them
on holiday in Miami last year.

Despite numerous visits to her GP, she
said she had not shown the doctor her bruises because she did not want 
to get Collins into trouble.

A tearful Miss Larke said: ‘Justin was the love of my life. I still loved him. I’m not going to grass up my boyfriend.’

She admitted telling Collins in an 
angry phone call after they had split in August 2011 that he was a ‘Z 
list celebrity’ who was ‘going nowhere’.

Presents: Collins is the former host of the Friday Night Project. The court heard he 'insisted' that his girlfriend 'sleep facing towards him' and today it heard how he showered her with gifts when he felt guilty

Trial: St Albans Crown Court where the court heard yesterday that Collins made his former 
girlfriend recount every sexual experience she had ever had for a 
notebook he kept as part of a campaign of domestic abuse

The court was also told she had sent him texts after they split saying she could not live without him.

Miss Larke said: ‘I couldn’t stop crying. It was like grief. It was like someone had died.’

Finishing her cross-examination, Miss 
Woodley accused Miss Larke of being a fantasist. Miss Larke replied: ‘I 
would suggest I am absolutely not.’

Collins, of Kew, west London, denies a single charge of harassment by causing her fear of violence.

The trial continues.
