Jake Berry's chosen tipple from an award-winning brewery in Ramsbottom, Lancashire, has fallen foul of the Commons PC brigade - because its label features black-faced Morris dancers

When an MP was asked to nominate a guest ale from his constituency to be served at a House of Commons bar, he was only too happy to help out.

But Jake Berry’s chosen tipple from an award-winning brewery in Ramsbottom, Lancashire, has fallen foul of the Commons PC brigade – because its label features black-faced Morris dancers.

The beer from the Irwell Works Brewery was intended to celebrate the Britannia Coconut Dancers from nearby Bacup, who have been performing since 1857 with blacked faces to celebrate the area’s mining heritage.

But officials said the image may cause offence, so the beer will be served in the Strangers Bar sporting the Bacup crest instead.

Parliamentary chiefs threw out the pale ale which had been specially crafted by a multi award-winning Rossendale brewery, saying the imagery ‘may have caused offence.’ 

MPs and local politicians slammed the decision, saying it ‘favours political correctness over common sense’.

The Coconutters have hit out, saying their traditional black make-up and colourful turbans, red and white kilts and clogs, are a celebration of Lancashire’s mining heritage.

It comes days after Will Straw, son of Blackburn MP Jack, was embroiled in a Twitter storm after posting a picture of himself with the morris dancing troupe.

Joe Healey, Coconutters secretary, called the decision ‘a real sad shame’.

He said: ‘I don’t understand the furore. Some people make caustic comments without understanding the tradition.

‘After recent comments made about us, I felt compelled to go back through our history, and there is no racial element whatsoever. There is no mention of race or ethnicity.

‘Researchers from Sheffield University have done the same, and come to the same conclusion.'

Irwell Works Brewery in Ramsbottom dropped the image of the Coconutters from the beer pump and replaced it with the Bacup crest, which will accompany the ale in the Strangers Bar.

Mr Berry said: ‘We thought of several names, but as the boundary dance was saved earlier this year, I thought it would be a fitting tribute to name the beer after the Britannia Coconutters, to celebrate their huge contribution to traditional dancing and their charity work across Rossendale.

A spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'The ale offered was not acceptable as the imagery proposed to be used in connection with sales may have caused offence'

‘The House of Commons authorities did not feel that this would comply with the strict rules they have regarding the naming of guest beers and requested us to choose one of our alternative suggestions.

‘I’m disappointed in the House of Commons Authorities decision. People who live in London obviously have no understanding about our Lancashire traditions.’

Sara D’arcy, managing director of Irwell Works Brewery, said: ‘After Jake suggested we do a beer featuring the Coconutters, I made it up and we sent it down with him.

‘He came back to us and said they thought the picture of them could offend people, so we changed it to the Bacup crest.’

A spokesman for the House of Commons said: ‘The ale offered was not acceptable as the imagery proposed to be used in connection with sales may have caused offence.’
