An enormous 18th century map of London which charts the rebirth of the city after it was rebuilt in the wake of the 1666 Great Fire has emerged for sale.

The 13ft-wide map, which took almost a decade to complete, gives a fascinating insight into London on the cusp of its transformation into the greatest city in the world.

It reveals how the city was tiny in comparison to the modern day equivalent, with the map revealing Buckingham Palace as a country estate surrounded by open fields while Hyde Park was on the very outskirts of the city.

Fascinating: This huge 18th century map of London which charts the rebirth of the city after it was rebuilt in the wake of the 1666 Great Fire has emerged for sale 

Historic: The fascinating map was created by 18th century cartographer John Rocque, and at the time was the most detailed map of London ever made, as well as being the first large-scale map of the city to be made after it was devastated by the fire 

It also shows Tyburn, where Marble Arch now stands, the site of public executions in the city for 600 years, and details the Old Palace of Westminster, a medieval complex destroyed by fire in 1834.

Unlike today, just two bridges are seen to span the Thames - Old London Bridge and Westminster Bridge. 

The fascinating map was created by 18th century cartographer John Rocque, and at the time was the most detailed map of London ever made, as well as being the first large-scale map of the city to be made after it was devastated by fire in 1666.

Rocque, a Huguenot who had moved to England from France with his parents in 1709, began the painstaking project in 1737 and did not finish it until 1746.

River crossings: The map shows how during the Georgian era there were just two bridges across the Thames - Westminster Bridge (left) and Old London Bridge (right)

Multiplied: A look at a map from today shows how the two bridges have been joined by a further nine, making it easier for Londoners to cross the river

In detail: Westminster Bridge crosses to the old Palace of Westminster (left), destroyed by fire in 1834 and replaced by the Houses of Parliament we know today (right)

It was created to a scale of one mile to 26 inches and made using a ground-level survey with the help of a compass and a chain, before the details were engraved onto  24 separate copper plates which were then coated in ink and pressed onto paper.

The 6.5ft tall map provides a snapshot into what London looked like in the Georgian era and is now considered among the most important British maps ever made.

'You really have to stand in front of it to understand the scale of it - it is huge,' said Christie's map expert James Hyslop.

'It's basically the first large-scale map of London made after the Great Fire. Historically it's a really interesting snapshot of how Georgian London looked.

The way things were: Buckingham Palace is shown on the map as a country estate surrounded by open fields

Official residence: Other buildings have crept closer to the home of the British monarchy, but the green spaces of Green Park and St James's Park remain

'It is a wonderful document to study - Oxford Street has open fields to the north of it and there are dozens of boats on the Thames. It's amazing to see how far we have come in just a few hundred years.

'The scale is 26 inches to a mile so the level of detail is incredible.

'John Rocque was a Huguenot who came to London in the early 17th century and was a bit of a jack of all trades when it came to maps - he was a surveyor, publisher and engraver.

'This map was quite an expensive undertaking and took nine years to complete. It was far too big to print in one go and so it was made on 24 separately engraved plates.'

Just a few hundred copies of the map were printed and only a handful are known to exist today.

How things change: Covent Garden Market, as it appears on the 18th century map. The market had existed at the site since 1654

Sprawling: The former fruit and vegetable market in the central square, which was reopened as a shopping complex in 1980 after the market's relocation in 1974, is now a popular shopping and tourist site

The map, titled 'A plan of the cities of London and Westminster and borough of Southwark' is tipped to be sold for £40,000 when it goes under the hammer at auction house Christie's after it was put up for sale by a private collector.

Mr Hyslop said: 'This is one of the original editions of the print which would have been limited to the low hundreds. The survival rates are very low and there are a handful in institutions. 

'When it was first printed it would have been in a gentleman's library and at some point over the years it has found its way to a private collector. 

Changes: Newly built Grosvenor Square is shown on the western edge of the city, before the open fields and market gardens of Hyde Park, here called Hide Park (left). The fields around the square have long since been replaced with homes and businesses, and the square is now the centre of the exclusive Mayfair district

Infamous: The site of the gallows at Tyburn, where public executions were held for 600 years (left), is now home to Marble Arch (right). The structure was originally built to stand at the entrance to Buckingham Palace, and was completed in 1833, but it was moved to its current location in 1851

'It has passed through the hands of many people but it is likely that it has always remained in London.

'The sheer size of this map combined with its incredible condition is what makes it so valuable. It really is impressive.

'This is one for someone who loves London and has a wall big enough to mount the map on.

'Anyone who sees this map is amazed by it. It is a beautiful work of art and a wonderful piece of history that tells the story of London almost 300 years ago.'

Dedication: A scroll on the map  thanking the Mayor and Aldermen of the city for their help with John Rocque's epic cartographic undertaking
