JERRY LEE LEWIS: HIS OWN STORY by Rick Bragg (Canongate £20)

John Lennon kissed his feet and told him he’d been his formative influence. Tom Jones felt the same. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones was — is — devoted to him.

And now, Jerry Lee Lewis has told his own remarkable story — possibly in the nick of time. Rock ’n’ roll’s original wild man, its most improbable survivor, is photographed in this absorbing biography with the latest of his seven wives, and looks as inert and dead-eyed as a waxwork.

Yet he made a Top 30 album as recently as 2008 and in his 80th year he still occasionally performs live, pulling in an adoring crowd. The man they still call ‘Killer’ continues to hammer those ivories like he always did, only now he hammers them with his walking-stick, a showman to the end.

Wild man of rock ’n’ roll: Lewis in his heyday. He made a Top 30 album as recently as 2008 and in his 80th year he still occasionally performs live, pulling in an adoring crowd

When the end does come, the surprise will be that it didn’t arrive sooner.

Lewis has outlived two of his wives (the fourth and fifth of whom died in mysterious circumstances) and even two of his children, but he hasn’t exactly looked after himself.

Nor, for that matter, has he looked after his reputation. The man who so inspired Lennon, Jones, Richards and many others has a seriously long rap sheet; his many crimes include car theft, bigamy and assault.

He acquired the nickname ‘Killer’ while still at school, for half-strangling a teacher. His first cousin, TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, no angel himself, has built quite a sideline out of praying for Jerry Lee’s soul.

It was a lost cause, that soul, long before the night in November 1976 when, dead drunk, Lewis rammed the gates of Elvis Presley’s Graceland mansion with his Lincoln Continental.

When the Memphis police arrived to arrest him, they found that he had a loaded gun in the car.

To this day, Graceland tour guides tell the story, and while Lewis hotly denies to his biographer Rick Bragg that his intention that winter’s night was to shoot his old buddy Elvis, fact and fiction are as intertwined in this book as, well, rock and roll. So who knows?

Bragg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, concedes at the outset that over the two summers he spent listening to Lewis reminiscing, the old rascal remembered his life ‘as it pleased him’.

So this is very far from a definitive chronicle. But it is still a thumpingly good yarn about a man whose amazing stagecraft once left even the similarly flamboyant Chuck Berry lost for words.

In March 1958, while touring with Berry and Buddy Holly, Lewis grudgingly agreed to Berry topping the bill

In March 1958, while touring with Berry and Buddy Holly, Lewis grudgingly agreed to Berry topping the bill.

But he never made it easy for other performers to follow him onstage — Johnny Cash did it once, and refused ever to countenance the idea again — and one night in Brooklyn, Lewis made it impossible.

With Berry waiting in the wings, Lewis poured petrol over his piano, set it alight, and played Great Balls Of Fire as it burned.

Some who were there attest that when eventually he swaggered off stage, with the audience exultant, flames still leaping from the piano and fire trucks on their way, he said to Berry, ‘Follow that, n*****!’ To Bragg, he vehemently denies using the N-word. Again, who knows?

Either way, it is hard to think of any musician of any era with a story as colourful as this, or with such a talent for finding trouble.

But for all his crimes, all the drink, drugs, hot-headedness, the jaw-dropping extravagance, there was really only one scandal that Lewis has never shrugged off.

It erupted in Britain, in that same eventful year of 1958, when reporters here learnt that he had recently married — bigamously, to boot — his 13-year-old third cousin, Myra Gale Brown. The matter was even raised in Parliament, and he was booed at his concerts, and called ‘cradle robber’.

This is where Bragg’s journalistic antennae go haywire, so in thrall is he to Lewis’s side of the story.

Myra is presented as a seductive Lolita, with 22-year-old Jerry Lee powerless to resist. ‘She was slim,’ writes Bragg, ‘with wavy brown hair and a swan’s neck and big, big eyes, and if she was a child, he was a Russian monkey cosmonaut.’

The British Press, meanwhile, come across as moralistic prudes. In an otherwise thrillingly readable book, it’s a rather revolting exercise in justification.

Still, it’s true that back in rural Louisiana, where Lewis came from, making a bride of your 13-year-old cousin seemed like no big deal.

Lewis' relationship with Presley was sullied and so his relationship with Priscilla Beaulieu, which began when she was only 14, went uncensured

He still can’t understand the brouhaha it caused, and remains deeply resentful that it so sullied his reputation when Elvis’s relationship with Priscilla Beaulieu, which began when she was only 14, went uncensured.

Bragg tries hard, without ever quite succeeding, to get to the bottom of Lewis’s complex relationship with Presley, whom for several years he rivalled as rock ’n’ roll’s hottest property.

They were close enough to spend one wild night riding their Harley-Davidson motorbikes round Memphis, both stark naked, according to a story that Lewis, this time, does not deny.

Just like Elvis, Lewis was born into Deep South poverty in 1935, the height of the Great Depression

But each was thoroughly chippy about the other, and time hasn’t diminished Lewis’s chippiness. Elvis couldn’t really act, he tells Bragg, and Johnny Cash couldn’t really sing.

Just like Elvis, Lewis was born into Deep South poverty in 1935, the height of the Great Depression. Also like Elvis, he had a father who served time in prison. But Elmo Kidd Lewis did one great thing in his life, mortgaging his small farm to buy the child prodigy a piano.

Before he became a star, Jerry Lee even trained to be a preacher, like cousin Jimmy.

His tortured Christian faith is another recurrent theme of his life. But pretty much everyone who heard him play the piano knew that’s where his destiny lay.

His big break arrived when he was 21, when record producer Sam Phillips got him a gig on primetime TV, and he played Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On live on The Steve Allen Show.

He was a sensation. Overnight his earning power leapt from $100 a show to $10,000, and when he and Myra later had a son, they called him Steve Allen Lewis.

But in 1962, aged three, the boy drowned in a swimming pool at their half-constructed home. Jerry Lee was away on tour when it happened. Myra, still only 17, was indoors, cooking spaghetti. Popular music has a tendency to amplify the triumphs and tragedies of its greatest performers, but still it is hard to think of anyone who has ridden life’s rollercoaster quite like Jerry Lee Lewis.

His rock ’n’ roll career never entirely recovered from the Myra scandal, but in the late Sixties, around the time his marriage to Myra was falling apart, country music embraced him and made him a superstar all over again.

Then, no sooner had he rescaled the mountain, than he went and lost another son, Jerry Lee Jnr, who died, aged 19, in a jeep the old man had bought him.

Even if Lewis had never played the villainous Iago alongside Sammy Davis Jnr and Zsa Zsa Gabor in a 1968 stage production of Othello — which gives Bragg yet another extraordinary episode to write about — this would still be a tale of Shakespearean dimensions.
