New MPs are to be given lessons in ethics to reverse the ‘jaundiced’ public view of politicians.

The Commons standards watchdog has proposed the lessons in the wake of the expenses and lobbying controversies.

Courses will start after the next general election, in 2015, and aim to bolster MPs’ confidence in how to act in public office.

Honesty: MPs will learn the difference between right and wrong in seminars modelled on those given to lawyers

Lord Bew, the chairman of the 
committee on standards in public life, said the seminars would raise 
‘the awareness of practical ethical issues among MPs’.

Lessons
 on how to accept gifts and contact with outside lobbyists would raise 
the ‘ethical sensitivity of members of parliament’, according to Lord 
Bew.

‘People are thrust into situations they don’t expect and they are 
not necessarily equipped to know how to behave,’ he said.

‘There
 are sometimes simple cases of corruption, but a lot of what is going on
 now is a little bit more complicated to work out what is right and what
 is wrong.’

Change: New chairman of the standards watchdog Lord Bew said gut instinct is not enough any more

He said MPs could no longer get away with going on their ‘gut’ feeling for right or wrong.

Instead,
 they needed to be offered compulsory, formal training to spot the 
pitfalls, in line with the lessons given to lawyers, accountants and 
bankers.

Lord Bew told the Sunday Times that trust has been eroded by 
the 2009 expenses scandal and members of the House of Lords lobbying for
 outside financial interests.

He said there is a ‘jaundiced’ public mood that must be corrected.
