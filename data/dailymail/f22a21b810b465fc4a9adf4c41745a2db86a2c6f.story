A caged walrus filmed in Crimea appears to be emotionally moved by a musician playing the flute.

In footage shot in at the Dolpinarium Aquatoria, in the settlement Livadiyathe near Yalta, the animal becomes animated as a male musician, known only as Alzibar, plays a tune through the bars of its grim-looking enclosure.

At first, the walrus, named Samson, appears disinterested, lying on the floor of his cage.

Surprising: The animal appears to be taking an interest as the musician begins to play the flute

However, moments after the flute performance commences  the mammal rears up and makes direct eye contact with the flute player.

The lone walrus seems to moved by the flute performance, moving his head repeatedly, appearing to  almost dance.

Eye contact: The walrus then moves closer to the musician and seems to be listening attentively

Getting a closer look: As the music plays, the animal pushes his head  up against the enclosure bars

During the video the marine mammal attempts to get as close to  the musician as possible, by pushing his head up against the enclosure bars.

Shuffling from side-to-side and bobbing his head, the huge animal looks out of place in what appear to be dire conditions.
