An animal lover is raising money to help a Romanian dog get life-changing fake limbs after he was found wandering the countryside on stumps as somebody had cut off his two front legs.

Colin the dog had been cruelly mistreated by its previous owner when it was discovered by Romanian animal welfare activist Diana Neacsu who contacted her friend Claire Revis who launched the ambitious rescue mission.

Ms Revis organised transport for Colin from Valcea in Romania to Brighouse, West Yorkshire where he will be fitted with his new limbs.

According to Ms Revis, Colin is able to walk on his stumps but he will be far happier when fitted with his new legs

According to Ms Revis, the dog had suffered the terrible injuries several months before he was discovered.

The 48-year-old former pub landlady from Brighouse, West Yorks said she managed to bring Colin to the UK after raising more than £6,000 for his treatment. 

He was transported almost 1,700 miles from Romania to Essex, where Ms Revis picked him up and drove the final part of the trip to West Yorkshire.

Initially, it was hoped that £5,000 would cover Colin's medical bills but he has required a longer stay in the vet and additional surgery, pushing the total bill towards £10,000.

However, he will soon be fitted with his £3,000 prosthetic legs which have been specially flown in from the United States.

She said: 'He was found in a horrendous state, he'd been walking on bare bones, the skin on his two front legs had come off and he had a lot of  infection.

'He'd probably lost them months before, the vets said they'd been chopped off  deliberately.'

According to Ms Revis: 'They have very limited vet facilities out there, and most of them are totally unsanitary. Luckily my friend knew of one in Bacau that was good.

'There he was cleaned up and given antibiotics, we spoke to a company called Orthopets who organise for limb reconstuction in badly injured animals.'

Due to the severity of his injury, Colin is undergoing additional surgery to further trim his front legs to ensure that the prothetics will be a success.

'We hoped he wouldn't need any more surgery but we have to cut back the bone to allow enough skin to cover the stump. The stitches have to be on the side so they don't rub on the new legs.'

The new limbs feature a cone which slides over the remaining stumps allowing Colin to walk once again.

The new limbs have been ordered from the United States and will be fitted once Colin recovers from his latest bout of surgery.

According to Ms Revis: 'It's so rewarding to see dogs that have been mistreated rehomed to loving families. It will take two or three weeks after he's fitted with the artificial legs for him to get used to it, just because he won't know what's going on.'

Ms Revis said Colin's injuries were caused by someone who deliberately cut off his front legs.

'I asked the vet whether he might have been caught in a trap but he said the injuries were level and looked deliberate. If he had been caught in a trap the injuries would have been different.

'I cannot understand why someone would want to do that to a dog. But animal cruelty is a major problem out in Romania. I want Colin to be a poster boy to highlight the issue and hopefully there will be no more Colins in future.

'There are dead dogs on every street in Bucharest, some tie wire around their necks and drag them around for pleasure. You'd be arrested over here for doing that.

'I have rescued a dog from over there before who had her entire face cut off with a machete, she was supposed to be a Border Collie but the new family thought she was a pug because of her injuries. I can't imagine how anyone could be so cruel.'

Added Ms Revis: 'Colin has had all his injections now, which he needed for coming to the UK after he had been living in the dirt with open wounds.

'There are about 100,000 stray dogs in Bucharest alone, but dog shelters just seem to pocket the money. Very few are actually given any food or medical care.

'Then there is the cruelty - people just go round the streets beating, maiming and even poisoning them. It's an act of power that people abuse, the poor dogs are completely defenceless.

'People have donated from all over the world to see him come over and get rehomed - I've been so overwhelmed by the whole thing.

'It's really restored my faith in humans.'
