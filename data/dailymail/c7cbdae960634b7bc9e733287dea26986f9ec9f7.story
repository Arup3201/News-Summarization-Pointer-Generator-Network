A British couple feared they would drop into the Atlantic Ocean when their flight home from holiday suddenly starting losing altitude at a rate of 500ft a minute.

Gary Barton and his wife Caroline were on board a Thomson Airways Dreamliner jet which had to perform an emergency landing in the Azores after one of its engines stopped working.

Mrs Barton, 48, said: 'We could see on our screens that our altitude was dropping about 500ft every minute. It looked like we were just dropping into the Atlantic.'

The 288 passengers flying on the Boeing 787 from the Dominican Republic to Manchester were left petrified by the mid-air drama, which unfolded miles from land.

Mrs Barton, from Leigh near Wigan, said: 'Approximately an hour and a half into the flight we noticed the engine noise change and a dip in the aircraft.

'The captain announced we had an engine failure and shut the second engine down on the right side of the plane and he said we would have to land in the Azores.' 

Describing what happened next, Mrs Barton, who was travelling with her daughter, added: 'It was a really frightening landing. Everyone was on edge - we were told to expect a bumpy landing because they had to use double thrust on one engine and we could see all the fire engines on the ground.

'Because it was dark it seemed so scary, all those flashing lights, it made everything look worse. They said it was just a precaution but we were very, very worried.

'It was extremely tense on that plane. Our daughter was shaking - she was saying "what if we don't make it?".'

The couple said passengers were then left to sit on the stricken jet on the military airbase's runway for five hours before eventually being allowed inside.

Mrs Barton said: 'It was only when everyone became agitated that the commander let us use their rest house.'

Mr Barton, 57, a print engineer, added: 'There were armed guards at the three exits with big machine guns, we couldn't move for two hours.'

When their rescue plane - a Boeing 767-300 - arrived, they were loaded on before waiting another hour for take-off, arriving back in Manchester after an 11 hour, 23 minute delay.

Mrs Barton said: 'We were provided with bottled water and a sausage roll and not an awful lot of explanation other than the fact the engine failed.

'We go on holiday a lot and we fly long haul often but we have never experienced anything like that before. We will not be flying on that plane again.'

Mr Barton added: 'They call it the Dreamliner but it was more like a nightmare.'

Fears of air passengers have been heightened this year by a series of  disasters and scares.

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared from radar in March, sparking a huge international search which has so far failed to find the aircraft or its 227 passengers.

Then, last month, another Malaysia Airlines flight, MH17, was shot down over Ukraine, killing all of the 283 people on board.

Earlier this week, an RAF Typhoon was scrambled to accompany a Qatar Airways flight into land at Manchester Airport after a passenger allegedly made a hoax bomb threat.

A Thomson Airways spokeswoman confirmed flight TOM157 experienced a technical issue and the aircraft diverted to Lajes airport in the Azores as a precautionary measure.

December 2009: The first test flight of the Dreamliner takes place - three years late.

July 2011: A fan shaft on an engine fails during runway tests at Charleston International Airport, South Carolina.

December 2012: A United Airlines 787 makes an emergency landing in New Orleans after electrical problems and a Qatar Airways 787 is grounded after electrical power distribution problems.

January 2013: A fire starts in a lithium ion battery pack of a Japan Airlines 787 in Boston in January. A day later United Airlines finds faulty wiring to battery and on the same day that about 150 litres of fuel spills from Japan Airlines Dreamliner during an aborted take-off. Later that month a cockpit window on an ANA Dreamliner cracks during a Japanese domestic flight. On January 15, another Dreamliner operated by ANA makes an emergency landing at Takamatsu in Japan after a smoke alert goes off. This forced all dreamliners to be temporarily grounded amid safety fears.

March 2013: A Thomson Dreamliner bound for Sandford in Orlando, Florida, was forced to return to Manchester Airport after it developed a mid-flight 'technical issue'.

She added: 'Due to overcrowding at the airport, passengers remained on board with refreshments provided. They were given further refreshments in the terminal before boarding a replacement aircraft which took them back to Manchester airport, arriving just after 5pm.

'The safety of our customers and crew is of paramount importance and we would like to apologise for the delay experienced.'

She said each party would be given £100 to cover expenses incurred as a result of the delayed arrival.

Launched in December 2009, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was heralded as the future of commercial flight. But the project was dogged by problems from the start..

Thomson is not the only airline to struggle with Dreamliner problems and, last month, two Air India jets destined for Birmingham and Sydney reported serious faults just before take-off.

In February, a computer malfunction aboard a Dreamliner also forced LOT Polish Airlines to call off a transatlantic flight from Warsaw.
