Around a third of items bought at last weekend's Black Friday sales stampede may have already been returned, new research claims.

Figures suggest millions were swept up by the frenzy into making purchases they did not want simply because goods were cheaper.

More than £800million was spent online on Friday and £720 million on so-called Cyber Monday this week during the growing trend for websites and stores to offer pre-Christmas sales.

But CollectPlus, a parcel rival to the Post Office, has seen a seen a 30 per cent rise in parcel returns this week compared to an average week.

Most appear to be hastily bought items from Black Friday and Cyber Monday, returned quickly by those hoping to get their money back in time to spend on Christmas.

The post-Black Friday surge will result in an estimated 31 per cent of online purchases being returned, according to a survey of more than 2,000 adult customers.

And it could cost British business up to £505 million in lost productivity and employee absence as the average customer will each spend 52 minutes returning parcels this Christmas, said the research.

Almost one in five Britons have taken time off work to return a purchase, said CollectPlus CEO Neil Ashworth.

Mr Ashworth said: 'With the increased enthusiasm for 'Black Friday' and 'Cyber Monday', we expect to see a sharp returns peak this week.

'Our research tells us that the average shopper is taking valuable time and losing money each year due to complicated or costly returns.

'As such, it is imperative that retailers have a robust model in place to ensure that customers can conveniently return any unwanted items and are quickly reimbursed.'

The boom in online shopping has led to a sharp rise in the number of British shoppers returning purchases by post, as opposed to just going into a store for a refund or exchange.

Natalie Berg, of research analysts Planet Retail, added: 'The frenzied nature of this year's Black Friday and, to a lesser extent, Cyber Monday events will have resulted in some panic buying.

'Having had time to reflect on whether such purchases are actually worth keeping, or indeed if it they were genuine bargains at all, many shoppers will be looking to return items this week.'
