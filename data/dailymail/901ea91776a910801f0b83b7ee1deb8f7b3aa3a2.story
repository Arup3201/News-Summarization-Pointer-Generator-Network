Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford has expressed frustration over 'ignorant athletes' making noise in the Commonwealth Games athletes' village.

Rutherford, who took gold for Great Britain on 'Super Saturday' at London 2012, tweeted this morning: 'Being in an athletes village is great until the ignorant athletes make more noise than a herd of elephants startled in a china shop.

The English athlete added, after team-mate Bianca Williams sympathised: 'It bloody kills me. I have the noisiest people above me with some serious big feet banging around.

'I think some people are determined to annoy every other athlete around them. Strong words will be said soon.'

Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, said no complaints had been received.

At a daily media briefing, Hooper said: 'It's a great environment within the village. We've had absolutely no complaints whatsoever. It's news to me the tweet that he's made.'

The athletes' village is located in Glasgow's East End, and is housing around 6,500 competitors and officials during the Games.
