The Reverend John Wiseman probably thought he was doing God's work by discussing men's health issues on his blog.

But his decision to show men how to examine their privates using a suggestive snap of a man wearing just his boxer shorts outraged parishioners at Sketty Methodist Church, Swansea.

The close-up photo, which Mr Wiseman says is not of him and was obtained from the internet, appears to show the man touching the front of his underwear-clad crotch.

It appeared on his 'A day in my life' blog at end of last month aimed at raising awareness of testicular and prostate cancer.

And it was promptly branded 'inappropriate' by his churchgoers amid fears it could be easily accessed by children.

Reverend Wiseman upset parishioners with his men's health awareness blog

Mr Wiseman says he uploaded the shot as part of the Movember campaign, which aims to raise awareness of serious health conditions men may be too embarrassed to talk about.

But this cut no ice his churchgoers.

One longstanding parishioner, who did not wish to be named said: 'We understand he’s trying to get an important message across but we don’t need to see a suggestive picture of a man touching himself.

'Children can access the blog - it is inappropriate for a church minister to put this on the internet.'

However the bearded Reverend was unrepentant about the posting, saying: 'I put the picture on the internet because testicular and prostate cancer are things that men in general don’t speak about.

'They wait until it is too late, by which time the available options are grossly reduced.'

Reverend Wiseman said the blog was intended to tackle health issues 'men don't speak about.'

The bearded churchman said had blogged the photo after feeling 'left out' of the traditional Movember campaign in which men grow moustaches for charity.

And he added: “It is one I cut and pasted off the internet.

'I put the picture on the internet because testicular and prostate cancer are things that men in general don’t speak about.

'They wait until it is too late, by which time the available options are grossly reduced.'

Refuting claims that the photo was of him, he joked: 'The picture is definitely not me - there would have been a much larger tummy!'
