West Ham are drawing up a 'long list' of potential new managers to replace Sam Allardyce in the summer.

The latest name on that list is former Holland and Barcelona boss Frank Rijkaard.

Other names include Slaven Bilic of Besiktas, Michael Laudrup, currently managing in the Middle East, Real Sociedad’s David Moyes and Marseille boss Marcelo Bielsa.

The club’s official line is that they will wait until the end of the season to decide on Allardyce’s future when his contract expires.

Football Grapevine revealed in the autumn that would be the case even when there were then suggestions that a new deal would be struck given how well the Hammers had started the season.

But that was never going to happen. Allardyce's position was under threat at the start of the campaign.

And indeed had West Ham started the season on current form - just three wins in 12 (two of those in the FA Cup, including a penalty shoot-out against Everton) ahead of Sunday's match with Tottenham - he would have been sacked.

The last eight Premier League games have seen one win, four draws and three defeats.

I understand the board have come to the conclusion that while overall Allardyce has done a good job in leading the club back to the Premier League and keeping it there the time has come for a new stimulus.

The 4-0 defeat at the hands of West Brom in the FA Cup could be the straw that broke the camel's back

Last week’s 4-0 humiliation at WBA in their FA Cup fifth round exit will likely be seen, on reflection in the summer, as the straw that broke the camel’s back.

And given that next season is the last at the Boleyn Ground I understand the club feel a new dimension is required most likely from a foreign coach to get the results AND play the sort of football that will attract new fans to fill the Olympic Stadium when they move in, in 2017.

The club have looked admiringly at the impact that Ronald Koeman has made at Southampton which is why fellow Dutchman Rijkaard ,who has been out of top level coaching since leaving Saudi Arabia in 2013, could be seen as a wise choice.

The situation could come to a head sooner if Sunderland part ways with Gus Poyet, who was on West Ham’s radar last summer and could yet be a candidate.

Allardyce would be an obvious target for Sunderland if that job becomes vacant.

But Big Sam may well seek a job abroad if as seems most likely he leaves the Hammers in the summer.

Theirry Henry is being groomed as a potential successor to Arsene Wenger.

Earlier this month FG revealed that Henry had started taking his coaching badges which would lead to a role working at London Colney training HQ initially with younger players.

Wenger confirmed that to be the last case last week.

There is a belief amongst the Arsenal hierarchy that with some coaching experience under his belt including moving up to help with the first team Henry could quickly acquire the right attributes to become a top manager despite lacking experience.

Former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry has taken up a coaching role and could be set for more in the future

Arsenal look as to how Pep Guardiola returned to Barcelona after his playing career ended, working as B team coach  before taking over from Rijkaard after one year.

In that sense a time table that could see legendary Gunners striker Henry take over at the start of the 2017-18 season is possible. It remains to be seen though how the rest of the season unfolds.

Current Ajax coach Frank de Boer, backed up by former Gunners Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars remains an option should the club wish to move in another direction.

Since his retirement, Henry has been working as a television pundit for Sky Sports

Edinson Cavani has been touted as a summer target for Arsenal in a £64million deal from PSG to make way for the French club signing Angel di Maria from Manchester United.

However, Real Madrid are considering making a move for the Uruguayan striker and it would be major shift in policy if Arsenal paid that sort of fee and the £250,000-a-week wages Cavani would want.

Robert Lewandowski has come onto Manchester United’s radar in what promises to be another summer of big spending for Louis van Gaal.

The Polish striker joined Bayern Munich from Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer last summer.

Eleven goals in 28 games has not been a bad return but the word in Germany is that he hasn’t really settled in under Pep Guardiola.

It seems certain United won’t exercise their option to sign Radamal Falcao on a permanent basis and Lewandowski would be in ideal addition to bolster their front line especially if he comes on the market around the £30 million bracket.

I am hearing

Real Madrid will battle PSG for Tottenham’s £25m-rated goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in the summer. 

I am also hearing

Andy Carroll could be sold by West Ham in the summer, that is if he can prove his fitness to another club.

The club’s hierarchy have grown weary of Carroll’s terrible injury record since making him their record singing at £15m 18 months ago following a season’s loan at the club from Liverpool

I hear Newcastle, who sold Carroll to Liverpool for £35m, would be willing to take him back but offer as little as £8 million plus appearance bolt ons. Carroll , sideline to the end of the season with a knee injury ,would also have to consider a wage cut.

With the likelyhood that Sam Allardyce ,who has so much belief in the player ,will be gone, the club would be ready to get the erratic England centre forward off their books

Carroll injured his knee but stayed on the pitch after West Ham had made all three of their substitutions

Carroll has posted a picture of his bandaged and swollen knee on his official Instagram account

QPR’s new manager Chris Ramsey spoke impressively when questioned about the events on the Paris Metro last week.

As one of the few black bosses in English football and who, as a player, started out in the early Eighties when racism was rife, Ramsey, 52, was better qualified than most to take a view on the situation.

And Ramsey was candid.

He went out of his way to stress that those guilty of the abuse were not real Chelsea supporters and the club itself should not be held responsible even if they had a duty to take the action of banning the fans from Stamford Bridge.

What Ramsey wants to see is the authorities in France and England take the lead in rounding up the bigots. Quite right.

Chris Ramsey spoke out his experiences with racism during his time in football

Ramsey stressed it was a social issue which he said has improved markedly over the course of time… with football often leading the way.

But he warned racism lurks hidden and disguised, often in places where on the face of it all the right anti-racists noises are made but behind closed doors. Which is why the authorities must show the will to pursue the suspects with vigour.

The depth and power of Ramsey’s words suggested he has the mental strength to succeed as a top-flight manager.

He certainly has the technical credentials having earned his stripes on merit after a playing career was cut short by injury, working with the FA, England Under 20s and most recently developing talent at Tottenham.

In many ways it was the emergence of black players as heroes to kids of all races, players like Laurie Cunningham, Cyrille Regis, John Barnes, Ian Wright, Patrick Vieira, that helped push racists to the edges of the football world.

A new wave of black managers can only help the cause further.

So I just hope things go well for Ramsey at QPR and he shows he can handle to pressures of being a top-flight boss as well as he handled last week’s press conference .

And who knows if he does, then in a few years’ time Ramsey could become the England national team’s first black manager.

BTW: 

It was good to catch up with Trevor Sinclair on the phone last week about the reunion he had with some ex-Blackpool stars last week.

The former England winger was particularly delighted to see Jimmy Armfield at the function.

Jimmy is now 79 but it was great to hear Trevor report that the former England right back and skipper before Bobby Moore was in good shape.

Trevor Sinclair met up with some of his ex-Blackpool team-mates at a reunion 

I recalled a conversation I had with Jimmy some years ago when Steven Gerrard was breaking through into the England team.

Jimmy felt that England could actually get the best out of him, and Frank Lampard, by playing Gerrard as playmaker at right back or wing back.

‘Really?’, I questioned. Armfield went on to point out the brilliance of Carlos Alberto as Brazil right back and captain in 1970 and then Cafu who won two World Cups in 1994 and 2002.

Armfield continued that sometimes in international football the only space to exploit is when coming deep from the flanks and that players must adapt from their club positions to impose themselves in the national side.

As Sinclair said, such thinking out of the box is what is often needed to make an international team full of individual stars, winners. Sadly in England it’s not since the days of Glenn Hoddle that there has been a manger prepared to do so.

Last season West Ham beat Tottenham three times, twice in the league then at White Hart Lane in the Capital One Cup.

Spurs beat the Hammers on the opening day of the season and it hard not to see a Spurs win at home. Coral quote 5/6, the draw is 13/5, while a Hammers win 7/2.

Not surprisingly Harry Kane is 7/2 to score the first goal. But Diafra Sakho at 8-1 might be worth a tickle if the Hammers start on front foot.

A possible treble today then is a Spurs win, with both Everton vs Leicester and Southampton vs Liverpool to end up as draws.
