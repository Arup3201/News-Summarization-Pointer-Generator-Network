With all of the hype around Grand Theft Auto at the moment, it's easy to forget the other huge titles just around the corner.

All except one... Metal Gear Solid V.

Metal Gear Solid V is composed of both Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. Ground Zeroes takes place after the events of the previous Peace Walker
game - acting as a prologue to The Phantom Pain.This, in turn, takes place nine years after the Big Boss falls
into a coma.

Just around the corner: Snake - voiced by 24 actor Kiefer Sutherland - plans his attack

Powered by Kojima-Productions’ Fox Engine, the game follows Big Boss
and McDonnell Miller investigating an organisation called the XOF – who are responsible
for destroying the Mother Base.

Although the gameplay trailer initially looked beyond 
current
generation hardware, the Fox Engine is capable of running on both Xbox 
and PS3. The 2014 incarnation of Pro Evolution Soccer, for example, runs on a scaled-down version of Fox.

It has been confirmed that the game will run at 60 frames-per-second on next-gen hardware, and 30 FPS on current gen. Assassin's Creed: Black Flag also follows this model.

Although details are being kept under wraps, Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima has
described The Phantom Pain as an open world game – giving the player more
choice than ever before. 

There is rumoured to be a base-building feature - as in Peace Walker, that can be accessed via your smartphone, while a dynamic day-night cycle helps reinforce the feeling of time passing when traversing the huge map.

On the run: animation has been overhauled thanks to the power of the Fox Engine

There are new ways to travel, too, for example taking planes, helicopters and motorcycles, while missions can be undertaken in different orders, subsequently affecting the story but ultimately arriving at a similar conclusion at the end of the game.

Fan-favourite David Hayter will not be featuring in the games. Speaking to the website Gamestrailers, Kojima didn't involve Hayter because he wants to create a 'completely new type of Metal Gear game'. He is replaced by 24 actor, Kiefer Sutherland.

For the first time in the series, facial motion capture will be used on English-speaking stuntmen and actors.

Metal Gear Solid V will also include the new version of Metal Gear Online, but this is being kept under wraps by Kojima Productions' new Los Angeles division.

Either way, we can't wait.

Stunning: gameplay footage is relatively sparse but there's no denying just how good Ground Zeroes looks
