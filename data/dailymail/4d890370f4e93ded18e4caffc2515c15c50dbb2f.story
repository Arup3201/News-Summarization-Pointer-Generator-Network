Variante del Rettifilo is the right/left chicane at the end of the wide start straight at which the cars of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are likely to be close enough for mutual destruction.

Those two title rivals will start the Italian Grand Prix on the front row of the grid, Hamilton on pole, Rosberg alongside him. Within a few gear-flicking seconds, the road will narrow and the two of them will try to thread their silver Mercedes over the kerbs in the shortest and fastest way.

Both hope to reach the flat-out Curva Biassano. But there are no guarantees that they will reach there, and none that they will leave there.

In front of up to 100,000 in this crumpled cathedral of Italian motor racing at the centre of the tree-strewn Royal Park, the latest unmissable instalment of the 2014 world championship will unfold.

Most of those here with their banners are disciples of Ferrari, the team that Enzo built into an icon of a nation, but with the shiny scarlet cars off the pace, it is the tussle between a cerebral German and an instinctive Briton that promises to provide the greatest excitement of the afternoon.

The backdrop to the race was provided a fortnight ago at Spa, where Hamilton and Rosberg collided on the second lap. Hamilton ultimately retired from the race. Rosberg, the aggressor, survived a broken front wing to come second and increase his advantage in the drivers’ championship to 29 points.

The row afterwards was even more feisty. It ended up with Rosberg being fined by Mercedes and apologising to his team, his rival and the seemingly the whole world. Both were warned to keep it clean, though their management will permit them to race free of team orders.

So after Hamilton  claimed his first pole since the Spanish Grand Prix more than half-a-season ago – on May 10 – the question was how they would race in the first few frantic moments tomorrow along the fastest lap in Formula One.Would the keep-it-clean instruction be in their minds? ‘It won’t be ringing in my ears,’ said Hamilton.

Sitting next to him, Rosberg said: ‘It’s a question I am not able to answer. The message is that we keep on racing. Every situation is different.’

Fasten your seat belts. 

Hamilton was strangely underwhelmed in the post-qualifying press conference.

‘It is a great feeling to be up here he said,’ with all the enthusiasm of a dental patient mid-filling rather than somebody who had interrupted Rosberg’s run of six poles in seven races. ‘As for me, I’m… looking forward to it.’

Mercedes’ outright pace suggest they should be too strong to be challenged, yet mechanical glitches have hindered them more regularly than expected. Hamilton sat out an hour of Friday’s second practice session with an electrical problem and Rosberg missed yesterday practice with a faulty gearbox.

‘Every race is important,’ said Hamilton. ‘But time is running out. I need those points.’

True Brit: Jenson Button's future at McLaren remains uncertain - his contract expires at the end of the year 

All the top six – Hamilton, Rosberg, Valtteri Bottas in third, his Williams team-mate Felipe Massa and the McLaren pair of Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button are powered by Mercedes engines.

To the disgruntlement of the Italuan fans Fernando Alonso starts in seventh place while the second Ferrari of Kimi Raikonnen was only 12th fastest.

Ferrari’s recent dismal run of form led the Monza rumour-mill to suggest that Luca di Montezemolo, the 67-year-old team president, might stand down after more than 40 years of high-level service with the company. But with a sweep of his hair, he dismissed tales of his demise. ‘I told the Ferraru board in March that I was ready to accept three more years for my shareholders and particularly for my people, the women and men of the Ferrari,’ he said. ‘They are the most important part of my life and I took a commitment with them.

‘We are preparing an historic record at the end of this year in terms of financial and economical results, so Ferrari is facing a fantastic moment.

‘If and when there is some news about me, I will be the first – I emphasise the first – to let you know.’

Di Montezemolo is not only a great survivor but among Formula One’s big beasts, a name to set alongside the likes of Bernie Ecclestone, Max Mosley and Ron Dennis. Mosley derided him as a bella figura  – roughly translated as all fur coat and no knickers. Living up to his theatrical billing, Di Montezemol enveloped Alonso in a long, lingering, listing hug.

Another hugger was Hamilton, embracing his dad Anthony on the way to the car. There is at least some love here among the enmity.
