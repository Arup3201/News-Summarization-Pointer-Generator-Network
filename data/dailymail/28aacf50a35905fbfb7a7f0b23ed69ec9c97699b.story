The mastermind of a £2.5 million fraud has gone on the run, fleeing with his passport just days before he was due to be sentenced.

Maxwell Parsons, 48, was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud at a trial at Manchester Crown Court, and was convicted in his absence. 

He was due to appear at the court for his sentencing, but is now being hunted by the police after he failed to show up.

Parsons also found a way to reverse transactions, and used it to carry out a sophisticated money generation scam using a bureau de change

Parsons was found to be the brains of a
 sophisticated fraud operation based in Greater Manchester, which cost 
the banking industry more than £2 million.

Parsons' scheme managed to rake in £5,000 a day before he was caught

Despite
 being convicted of the conspiracy, he was considered low-risk enough to
 sit outside the dock throughout the four-week trial, as well as not 
having to surrender his passport.

Parsons is a self-taught computer fraudster, who found a way to manipulate banking 
systems so payments were automatically reversed - meaning money could be
 spent again and again.

Most of the transactions were carried out 
at bureau de changes in Greater Manchester, so purchased cash could be 
converted back into sterling.

Previously, Parsons was jailed for bugging cash machines using MP3 players to clone people's debit and credit card details.

An HM Courts and Tribunals Service spokeswoman confirmed Parsons had not been asked to hand over his passport as a part of his bail conditions.

Parsons goes by a number of aliases, and has already proved his skills in defrauding, so may prove hard for authorities to track down.

He faces up to 10 years in jail if he is brought back before a judge.

Parsons carried out the scam between December 2008 and June 2009, and at its peak, the scheme raked in £50,000-a-day before being stopped by Greater Manchester Police in 2010.

Three of Parsons' collaborators in the fraud, who are all from the Stockport and south Manchester areas, have previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud.

Takhliq Khaliq, 47, of Boddens Hill Road, Heaton Mersey, his brother Zaki Khaliq, 44, of Carwood Road, Bramhall, and Muhammed Khan, 43, of Alexandra Road South, Whalley Range, are set to be sentenced along with Parsons.

Sentencing has now been adjourned until May 9.
