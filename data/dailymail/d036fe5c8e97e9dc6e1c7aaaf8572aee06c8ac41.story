Hundreds of migrants dropped to their knees and threw their hands in the air this morning in scenes of jubilation after they successfully scaled a six-metre (20ft)-high barbed wire border fence to enter one of Spain's enclaves in Africa.

More than 200 migrants stormed across a triple-layer border fence into Spain's north African territory of Melilla, at about 06:00 local time (05:00 GMT) at Ben-Enzar crossing point. 

In one of the largest such attempts in several years, some 300 people launched the dawn bid, but 100 people failed to get across due to injuries.

Although they celebrated their successful crossing they are actually likely to be expelled from Melilla.

It was the second such crossing in a week and Carlos Montero, who runs a temporary accommodation centre for migrants, said the centre, which was intended to house 500, now has 1,300 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa.

Photos from the scene showed many of the migrants suffered cuts scaling the fence and had injured legs from jumping to the ground. 

Melilla is surrounded by Morocco and the Mediterranean Sea and thousands try each year to enter the city and Spain's other coastal enclave, Ceuta.

On February 6, at least 15 migrants drowned while trying to enter Ceuta by sea.

Last week Spain's Interior Ministry posted videos online showing police firing rubber bullets as African migrants swam into Spanish territory from Morocco, but denied this action contributed to the drowning of 15 migrants.

The police-produced videos show bullets striking the sea as migrants tried to swim around the fence separating Moroccan territory from Spain's North African enclave of Ceuta on February 6.

Earlier, hundreds had tried to breach border security barriers by land.

Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said police fired the projectiles in front of the migrants, not directly at them. He said all victims had drowned in Moroccan waters.

Spanish officials initially denied that rubber bullets had been fired into the sea.

But Diaz told lawmakers February 13 that police fired rubber bullets, blank cartridges and smoke canisters to try to spur the migrants to stay in Morocco.

Diaz said despite the police action, 23 migrants did arrive in Ceuta, and he suggested this demonstrated that police had not used excessive force.
