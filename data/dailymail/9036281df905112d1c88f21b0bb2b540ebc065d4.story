Disturbing CCTV footage has surfaced of a Chinese zookeeper abusing a one-month-old tiger cub.

The vision, which comes from inside Nanchang zoo in Jiangxi, south-east China, shows the keeper hoisting up the cub, hanging it upside down and slapping it repeatedly in the face.

Animal rights groups have condemned the clip, saying it is ‘appalling’ and that they are chasing the zoo over the incident.

The footage also shows the man in a red coat hanging the 40-day-old cub by its arm and violently shaking it until it crashes onto the floor.

The 2.40 second long clip,  uploaded to LiveLeak, mentions the employee is under investigation by the zoo management in the description.

Dave Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia ‘we are of course appalled by the incident, which we are taking up with the zoo directly.’ 

‘We hear from the zoo already that one of the keepers involved has been dismissed due to this incident,’ he said.  

Nicola Beynon, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection, said the setting of the video is a further sign of cruelty.

'Wild animals belong in the wild, not in crates where they’re subjected to horrible abuse,' she said.

'While we don’t know when or where this video was taken, the person in the video should be subjected to the full force of any laws prohibiting this cruel behaviour.'

An official from the zoo announced that the keeper has been dismissed over the incident and the cub is in good health.

They said there will be substantial preventative measures taken to ensure the incident does not occur again, reports Shanghaiist. 

In 2010, The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said it would be inspecting zoos nationwide to check if they were abusing animals, but a string of recent reports suggest the problem is still rife.
