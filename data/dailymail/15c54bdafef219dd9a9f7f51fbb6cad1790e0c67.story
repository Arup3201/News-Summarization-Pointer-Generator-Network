He may have been spotted buying some sausage rolls from Greggs the other day but judging by his latest campaign pictures, David Beckham hasn't been overindulging on the calorific snack.

The 39-year-old has just unveiled his latest AW14 Bodywear collection for H&M and looks incredibly toned in the shots.

While we are more distracted by his rippling abs and moody model stance, David's new range comprises of underwear and loungewear - all modelled to perfection by the former footballer.

The father-of-four designed the range himself and is clearly keen to show off the fruits of his labour.

Sporting a much more messy and edgy hairstyle than we are used to seeing, the A-lister proves his worth as a model in the black and white shoot.

Speaking about his latest collaboration with the high street giant, David said: 'These new pieces for my Bodywear range at H&M have a real energy about them.

'I genuinely enjoy the creative process with H&M and we have had fun this time playing with colour and texture.

'I hope people like them as much as I do.'

Aside from modelling his range, which lands in store on August 21, David got the chance to spend some quality time with his only daughter Harper yesterday.

The former footballer was seen carrying the gorgeous tot in his arms as they ran errands around Notting Hill in the sunshine.
