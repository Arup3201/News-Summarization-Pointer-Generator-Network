Tragic: Ashley Ebanks, 22, was killed after falling in front of a taxi on a dual carriageway because the shoes he was wearing had slippery soles

A student was killed after falling in front of a taxi on a dual carriageway because the shoes he was wearing had slippery soles, an inquest heard today.

Ashley Ebanks, 22, was hit as he dashed across a road in Birmingham city centre on March 5 last year.

He had borrowed the smart shoes from a friend to make sure he got into a nightclub, Birmingham Coroner's Court was told.

Just minutes before he died, Mr Ebanks had complained to friends about how 'slippy' the soles were.

One friend, Surha Bains, told Friday’s hearing how Mr Ebanks had been one of a group of five who had been drinking in his city centre flat and had decided to go to the Oceana nightclub.

They caught a taxi but were forced to run across the busy dual carriageway on the Smallbrook Queensway after they were dropped off opposite the popular night spot.

Two of them managed to reach the other side but Mr Ebanks, who was studying business and economics at Manchester Metropolitan University, was stranded in the central reservation.

Mr Bains told the inquest: 'Ashley decided to run out into the road, a taxi was coming so he rushed and then he slipped and fell and got hit.'

Another friend, Rajdhir Dhanda, said he had loaned Ashley some shoes because the ones he was wearing were not smart enough to get into Oceana.

He added: 'He said the shoes fitted him but he said the soles felt a bit slippy.'

Pathologist Dr Peter Acland confirmed Ashley, from West Bromwich, West Midlands, died from a fractured skull.

He added that the bright student had also drunk twice the legal limit for driving.

He told the inquest: 'At this level, his judgement could have been impaired, particularly his reaction times.'

Taxi driver Sardar Mohammed will not face prosecution over the accident after police estimated he was travelling at less than 30mph.

Mr Mohammed told the hearing: 'One of the men put his foot on the road and I thought "he’s going to run", so I slowed down.

'But then he put his foot back on the kerb so I started moving again but he started running and was in front of the car when he slipped and fell.'

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Birmingham assistant deputy coroner Michael Snell said Mr Ebanks' footwear were to blame for his death.

He said: 'Ashley was required to change his footwear and borrowed some shoes and it is clear from the evidence that these shoes may have played a part in his ultimate accident.

'He had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol. His judgement may have been impaired and he may have attempted to cross the road in circumstances where had he been sober, he would not have done so.'

A verdict of accidental death was recorded.
