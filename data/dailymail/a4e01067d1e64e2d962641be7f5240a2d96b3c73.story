Yoga fans will be familiar with the downward facing dog, but what about the skyward facing seal?

This adorable creature was caught on camera holding an array of bizarre poses while balancing upon a rock in the middle of the sea off the coast of Estonia.

A photographer captured the astonishing scene as the seal switched effortlessly from fully stretched out on the rock, to balancing on its side with its eyes closed and one flipper in the air.

Seal-ly impressive: The creature was captured balancing on a rock in the middle of the sea off Estonia

Serene: With its eyes shut and one flipper outstretched, the seal appears almost as if it is practicing yoga moves

Valmar Valdmann, of Saaremaa, Estonia, spotted the seal as it basked in the sunshine on its perch.

'I noticed the seal on a rock from a distance, but seals are usually very afraid of humans, so I wasn't sure if I would be able to get a shot,' he said.

'As I approached the seal slipped into the water and disappeared - but now I knew that was his rock, I decided to just wait for him to come back.

'I found a good place to shoot and set up my camera in the middle of the water about 10 metres from the shore.

'The camera was just a few centimetres above the water, so as not to alarm the seal, and I was bending over the camera using the angled viewfinder.

'I sat down in the water and waited 
almost an hour for him to return,' said the photographer, whose patience
was rewarded when the seal eventually clambered back onto its perch.

Comfortable: Photographer Valmer Valdmann said once the large seal realised he was not dangerous it became comfortable with his presence

'Once he was convinced I was not dangerous, and perhaps not even human, he decided to come back on the rock,' Mr Valdmann said.

'He obviously started to feel quite comfortable, and he was looking straight at me.

'After a while the seal really decided to pose for me - he almost looked as if he was doing yoga or pilates. 'It was such an exhilarating experience - and I'm really pleased I was able to capture it on camera,' he added.
