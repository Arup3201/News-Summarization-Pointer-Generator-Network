Luke Shaw makes his England World Cup debut with a staggering £40million price tag hung on his head by Southampton.

Manchester United thought they had a deal cued up at around £30million to take the prodigious teenage left back to Old Trafford to begin Louis van Gaal's rebuilding task.

On the run: Luke Shaw and Chris Smalling during England training session on Monday

But new Saints boss Ronald Koeman has insisted he wants to do everything to keep the latest star product of the club's Academy at St Mary's.

Shaw, who celebrates his 19th birthday in two weeks time, was also wanted by Chelsea after an outstanding season for Saints but they were put off by the likely transfer fee even before Koeman took charge.

Now United, anxious to make a statement in the transfer market after failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1995, will have to decide how to react to Saints demands.

Team talk: England's manager Roy Hodgson with the players on Monday

Koeman has already seen centre forward Rickie Lambert leave for Liverpool, who are also chasing new England star Adam Lallana, while centre-half Dejan Lovren has put in a transfer request.

And he's demanded Saints play hardball over any other sales as the country's big clubs try to pick over their best players.

For all Shaw's talent it is an astonishing price to ask for a left back who is still learning his trade, and has yet to play a competitive international.

Call up: Shaw and Jack Wilshere will get the chance to shine against Costa Rica on Tuesday

He made his England debut as a second half substitute in a friendly against Denmark in February, and after being controversially chosen ahead of Ashley Cole in Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad got his first start in the 2-2 warm-up draw with Ecuador.

But he has only got a start now because England are already on their way home from Brazil and Hodgson will use Tuesday's clash with Costa Rica to give a game to everybody who has not been involved so far.
