A wannabe porn star and her father have been arrested on incest allegations after police discovered they have been having a sexual relationship and even have a child together.

George Sayers, 46, and Tiffany Hartford, 23, of Bethel, Connecticut, were charged on Monday with 
third-degree sexual assault in an investigation that began with a 
complaint by Hartfordâ€™s former girlfriend. DNA tests proved they are father and daughter and parents to their child.

Hartford's ex-girlfriend - who has not been named - went to police after discovering that Sayers was selling sex videos and photographs of her.

Sayers, 46, of Bethel, Connecticut, were charged on Monday with 
third-degree sexual assault. They lived in the same home with a number 
of other relatives

Arrested: George Sayers, right, and his daughter Tiffany Hartford, 23, were charged on Monday with third-degree sexual assault after police discovered they had a child together

Though she consented to the videos 
being made of her and Hartford having sex when they were dating, she was
upset that he was making money off them and selling them without her 
approval. She was only 16 or 17 at the time they were made.

The father and daughter were also charged with obscenity and conspiracy. They have pleaded not guilty to all charges.

A search of Sayers' computer turned up similar images, as well as a commercial video of Hartford dressed in risque outfits and 
posing in sexually provocative positions, crediting 
him with being the producer, police said.

Because she was over 16 when they were taken, they are not considered to be child porn.

Reported: Hartford's ex-girlfriend went to police when she learned Sayers was selling videos of the former couple having sex when they were just 16

Incest: Both Sayers and Hartford initially denied knowing they were father and daughter, but DNA tests confirmed this and that they had a son together

Hartford,
who would introduce Sayers as her 'husband/father', told police she had
dreams of being a porn star - this was before she became pregnant with 
her father's child.

In separate interviews, both Sayers and Hartford initially denied knowing they were father and daughter, according to the NewsTimes, although Sayers said at one point he believed that Hartford was the daughter of his deceased brother, police said.
