A 21-year-old has spoken of her shock after she visited her doctor with a cough and was told she needed a heart transplant.

Hannah Kelleher returned from holiday in Greece with a cough so bad she decided to see her GP.

She was diagnosed with pneumonia, but her GP also discovered her heart was enlarged and beating much too fast.

Hannah Kelleher, 21, went to see her doctor suffering from a severe cough. She was diagnosed with pneumonia but doctors also discovered her heart was beating too fast

The office worker from Havant, Hampshire, was told that her heartbeat was 240 beats a minute - the average is between 68 and 90 - so an ambulance was called to rush her to hospital.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscles in the walls of the heart become stiff, so they do not fill with blood normally.

Symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations and abdominal enlargement.

Up to a third of patients also suffer a complication such as a blood clot.

The condition is normally diagnosed based on a physical examination, an ECG and an echocardiogram.

Some patients can be treated with pacemakers but heart transplants can be required in severe cases.

She said: ‘Doctors told me my heart was twice the size it should be. I was stunned and scared.

‘After a week in hospital doctors were able to treat my pneumonia but my heart wouldn't shrink back to its normal size.’

Ms Kelleher was referred to a specialist who told her she had restrictive cardiomyopathy - a condition where the walls of the heart become rigid and it do not fill with blood properly.

Symptoms of the condition, which normally affects people aged over 50, include shortness of breath, tiredness and heart palpitations – Ms Kelleher had all three.

Doctors tried to treat the 21-year-old with tablets, but when this failed to help, the only option was for her to have a heart transplant.

She was told that she needed to be ready for the operation as soon as a suitable match was found.

She was treated for the pneumonia in hospital but her heart failed to improve so she had a heart transplant three weeks later

And just three weeks later, she was told a match had been found.

The night before her five-hour operation she sat her family down and went through her funeral plans.

However, the operation was a success and after spending almost four weeks recovering in hospital she was able to go home.

Ms Kelleher said: ‘I got a call at 7.30am from the hospital saying they may have found a match.

‘I didn't think it was going to happen. But after they did some checks they found it was a perfect match.

Ms Kelleher received a heart from a 48-year-old woman who had died

She has written to the donor's family to thank them for saving her life and is now encouraging more people to join the organ donor register

‘I was only told 15 minutes before the operation it was definitely going ahead.

‘My mum and dad went to the hospital with me and they were really nervous too.

‘Luckily it was a success - but without a doubt pneumonia saved my life.

She added: ‘I was always quite skinny and would feel sick after exercise, but I just put it down to something else.

‘Since my transplant I've been going to the gym and not feeling sick after exercising.’

Ms Kelleher now believes that developing pneumonia saved her life

Since her heart transplant, Ms Kelleher is able to exercise without feeling sick or dizzy

Ms Kelleher is now urging more people to get information about becoming an organ donor.

She said: ‘After discovering I'd got my heart from a woman of 48, I wrote to her family to thank them.

‘I thank her and her family for what they have done.’

Trish Collins, of south central organ donation team for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: ‘With heart donors, you don't really have an age limit as it's more to do with health issues.

‘For people that do carry a donor card, we would recommend they discuss this with their families.

‘We can't stress the importance of people signing up to the register.

‘You can save up to the lives of nine people by donating your liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart, lungs and small bowel. You can also donate tissue.’
