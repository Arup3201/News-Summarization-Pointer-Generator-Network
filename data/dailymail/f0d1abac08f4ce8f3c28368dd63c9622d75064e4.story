Mark Hughes believes his old club Chelsea have the strength in depth to win an unprecedented quadruple of the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Capital One Cup.

Jose Mourinho's side are top of the table, in the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup, through to the last 16 of the Champions League and face Watford in the FA Cup third round.

And Hughes, whose Stoke side host Chelsea on Monday night, admits John Terry could lift all four trophies this season.

Asked if winning the quadruple was possible, Hughes said: 'It wouldn't surprise me.

'It's a big ask - a lot of things have to go your way but they are strong enough. You just sense their belief. 

'There will be some very good teams who will try and stand in the way but I don't think where we are sat today you could argue that they've got no chance because that would be incorrect.

Stoke boss Mark Hughes believes his former club Chelsea can win the quadruple this season

'They have a chance, a better chance than most teams. The talk of winning every trophy, maybe in-house they believe that themselves. It wouldn't surprise me if they did.

'Once they get to a point in the season, around March or April, and if they are still in all competitions, having probably won the League Cup, then they will feel it's a real option for them, a real possibility. 

'You wouldn't back against them if they get to that point in the season. It certainly wouldn't surprise me if they won all four.'
