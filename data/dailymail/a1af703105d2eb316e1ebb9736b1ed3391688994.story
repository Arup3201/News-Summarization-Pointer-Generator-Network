A group of Canadian travellers have been awarded $30,000 in compensation after they claimed their holiday was ruined by hundreds of drunk students on their spring break.

The 19 angry tourists blame their travel agency for the ‘living nightmare’ that unfolded at the Mexican resort hotel, which was 'invaded' by 350 celebrating youngsters who urinated off their balconies and threw litter everywhere.

Despite complaints, the group's 'holiday from hell' did not improve and the Toronto travel agency has now been forced for refunds and moral damages by a Montreal court.

The Canadian travel group had arrived at Club Grand Coco Bay hotel in Riviera Maya, Mexico in March 2009 but were joined the following morning by ‘busloads’ of students.

The students were celebrating the traditional ‘spring break’, a mid-term holiday in America where predominantly college students go on group holidays to party and let off steam.

The drunk youngsters took over the resort, littered the pool area with broken glass, and forced staff to close the hotel’s Jacuzzi due to ‘fouled-up’ water.

‘The entire hotel was disrupted by shouts and noise that lasted all night,’ the judge’s decision from the Monteral court read.

‘Some customers had to deal with students on upper floors who urinated on their balconies.’

‘One of the hotel representatives even admitted to have “completely lost control of hotel security”,’ Sun News reported.

After complaints from the guests, the hotel threw out six of the students, but the plaintiffs said in court that this did not stop the disruptions.

A Montreal small claims court judge ruled against Sunwing Vacations travelling agency after the Quebec customers filed five separate claims seeking refunds for the cost of their vacation and moral damages of $500 per person.

Despite protests from Sunwing Vacations that they should not have to compensate for the group’s flights, as there were no complaints regarding the travel, the judge ruled for full compensation.
