A Mexican beauty queen killed over the weekend in a shootout between suspected drug traffickers and soldiers likely was being used as a human shield, a federal official said on Tuesday.

It emerged today that Maria Susana Flores Gamez, crowned 2012 Woman of Sinaloa in February, came out of the car first with a gun in her hands with the other gunmen hiding behind her, according to the attorney general's office.

The military report of the shootout said she went down in a hail of gunfire and was found dead near an assault rifle along with two other bodies.

'They used the woman as a human shield,' the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.

Killed: Maria Susana Flores Gamez, 20, was riding with a group of hit men for the Sinaloa drug cartel and was thought to have been used as a human shield

Accomplished: Miss Flores was voted 2012 Woman of Sinaloa in February and represented her nation in China for the Miss Oriental Tourism International contest

The official said he read the 
military report of Saturday's shootout in Flores Gamez's hometown of 
Guamuchil in western Sinaloa state, home to Mexico's most powerful 
cartel of the same name.

The attorney general's investigators are still trying to determine if the 20-year-old fired the gun she was holding.

The slender, 5-foot-7-inch brunette 
had competed with seven other contestants for the more prestigious state
beauty contest, Miss Sinaloa, but didn't win.

Miss Sinaloa state winners compete for
the Miss Mexico title, whose holder represents the country in the 
international Miss Universe pageant.

Mexico's Ximena Navarrete was crowned Miss Universe in 2010.

Local media outlets continue to misidentify Flores Gamez on Tuesday as Miss Sinaloa.

The organizers of the Miss Sinaloa 
pageant issued a statement on the pageant's Facebook page, seeking to 
make clear Flores Gamez was not their queen.

The misidentification 'damages the image and tranquility of our queens, their families and friends', the statement said.

Neither the state nor national pageants responded to requests for comment on Flores Gamez's death.

It was at least the fourth documented 
case of a beauty queen or pageant contestant becoming involved with 
Mexican drug traffickers, the theme of the critically acclaimed 2011 
movie Miss Bala, or Miss Bullet, Mexico's official submission to the 
Best Foreign Language Film category of Academy Awards.

The film tells the story of a young 
woman competing for Miss Baja California who becomes an unwilling 
participant in a drug-running ring, finally getting arrested for deeds 
she was forced into performing.

In real life, top Sinaloa cartel drug 
lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman married local beauty queen Emma Coronel, 
who later crossed into the United States to give birth to twin girls in 
2011.

In 2008, former Miss Sinaloa Laura 
Zuniga was stripped of her crown in the Hispanoamerican Queen pageant 
after she was detained that year on suspicion of drug and weapons 
violations.

She was later released without charges.

In 2011, a Colombian former model and 
pageant contestant was detained along with Jose Jorge Balderas, an 
accused drug trafficker and suspect in the 2010 bar shooting of Salvador
Cabanas, a former star for Paraguay's national football team and 
Mexico's Club America. She was also later released.

'A lot of young women are attracted by
the false riches of the drug gangs. They offer the fantasy of a life of
riches without much work,' said Judith del Rincon, a women's rights 
activist and former Sinaloa legislator. 'A lot of beauty queens wind up 
as girlfriends of some narco.'

Del Rincon added that the involvement 
of drug lords with beauty queens dates back at least to the heyday of 
the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix drug gang in the 1990s.

Sinaloa state prosecutor Marco Antonio
Higuera said Flores Gamez was traveling in one of several vehicles that
engaged soldiers in an hours-long chase and gun battle. He said two 
other members of the drug gang were detained.

The shootout began when the gunmen 
opened fire on a Mexican army patrol. Soldiers gave chase and cornered 
the gang at a safe house in the town of Mocorito.

Some men escaped, and the gun battle 
continued along a nearby roadway, where the gang's vehicles were 
eventually stopped. Six vehicles, drugs and weapons were seized 
following the confrontation.

Higuera said Flores Gamez's body has been turned over to relatives for burial.
