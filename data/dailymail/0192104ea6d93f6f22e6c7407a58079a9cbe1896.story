England's woeful showing at the cricket World Cup in Australia might make you feel sick, but it's the performance of an ex-England star that is turning stomach's down under.

Andrew Flintoff was always known as a brave sportsman, whether with the bat or ball, or even in his short-lived career as a boxer, but Freddie is showing a new type of bravery as he takes part in the Australian version of I'm a Celebrity... Get me Out of Here.

The former England all-rounder took part in a 'Tuker Trial' on Tuesday, and completed it by eating a cockroach with such nonchalance that the show's presenter ended up vomiting.

Host Dr Chris Brown lost his lunch as he watched former England cricketer Freddie Flintoff devour a large, brown, Madagascar hissing cockroach.

The cheeky ex-cricketer was given the task of devouring seven courses of critters, and as Chris watched on he couldn't hide his unease.

Putting his good table etiquette on show, the 37-year-old picked up the at least two inch long insect on chopsticks and tried to psych himself up about eating it.

'I'm going to do it and I'm going to crunch it and enjoy it,' he said to himself before he chomped down hard.  

Flintoff happily chewed the live cockroach, before expressing his disgust at the taste of the insect

The crunch was heard echoing throughout the jungle, while Freddie sat back on his chair like he'd just bit down on a T-bone steak at a Michelin star restaurant.

But it wasn't long before he acknowledged the true extent of the disgusting encounter.

'Oh the back end! Jesus... It's horrible!' Freddie roared.

Showing of his veterinary skills, Chris, 36, knew exactly why Freddie was having such an issue with 'the back end'.

'That's a female... The white stuff inside your mouth is the egg sack of the cockroach... It's her eggs,' Dr Chris told him as he held one hand over his mouth and clutched his stomach.

Unable to handle watching Freddie crunch down on the critters, Chris keeled over and started dry retching. He then had to walk away from the challenge to vomit in the bushes.  

'Oh the back end! Jesus... It's horrible!' Freddie roared as he showed his competitive streak
