A mental competency hearing broke out in chaos Friday afternoon as a man screamed out at the mother of a missing 5-year-old in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.

'Where's my nephew? What happened to my nephew?' Sandrino Oliver screamed at Elsa Oliver, whose son Jeremiah was last seen in September.

The Boston Globe reports that Sandrino Oliver resisted as he was brought out of the courtroom by both officers and his own relatives.

Unusual behavior: The attorney representing Elsa Oliver, seen here in court today, said that he has not been able to communicate with her in spite of hours spent together since her December arrest

After freeing himself from the group, Mr Oliver 'began to weep'.

The heartbreaking tale has been months in the making, as Jeremiah was reported missing in December when his sister told someone at her school that she and her siblings were being abused.

The girl said that the last time they saw Jeremiah- which is said to be on September 14- his hand was bleeding and for unexplained reasons, his mother Elsa was reportedly worried that he would die as a result of the hand wound.

Elsa Oliver and her boyfriend Alberto Sierra, 22, were first brought into court in December.

Oliver, 28, was out on bail since December as she was waiting for the psychological evaluation to determine if she was mentally fit to stand trial.

The court appearance that erupted into a screaming match today was dedicated to that evaluation, and Judge Margaret Guzman ruled that she was mentally sound, in spite of her lawyers assertions to the contrary.

Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous 
weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two 
counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and 
battery with a dangerous weapon.

James Reardon Jr., her attorney, told the Boston Globe that he has spent hours with her but she is incapable of coherently communicating with him.

The missing boy's biological father, Jose Oliver, said that while he is estranged from his wife, he does believe that she is still competent and thinks that- if allowed- he could have a conversation with her in a meeting to try to get some clues out of her.

He reportedly said that Elsa had spoken with his sister-in-law and said little and showed no emotion for her missing son.

At one point, she interjected asking: 'Is it the Rapture?'

Another concerning clue came during the initial investigation, when the found that Elsa has a tattoo with a butterfly and the date 'Sept. 25, 2013' written below it.

Police have spoken to local tattoo artists because they want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant.

It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah's disappearance, but an anonymous tip led them to believe that the mother's boyfriend may have had something to do with the alleged abuse.

The source said Sierra, 22, would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion.

Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous 
weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two 
counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and 
battery with a dangerous weapon.
