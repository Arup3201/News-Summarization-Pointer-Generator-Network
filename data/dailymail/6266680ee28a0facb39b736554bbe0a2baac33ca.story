These two friends are, quite literally, having a shocking night out.

In this hilarious footage an Australian duo can be seen zapping each other with a Taser while enjoying an evening out drinking.

At first the friends can be seen laughing and joking while they sit at the bar.

Zap! Two friends in Australia play around with a electroshock weapon while they sit drinking at a bar

Gotcha! Having shocked himself on the leg, one of the drunken duo reaches over to shock his friend in the arm

But soon enough one pulls out the electroshock weapon and sets it to the 'fun' setting.

He then starts messing around with the device while his friend watches on.

The drinker puts the Taser to his leg and presses the button - sending a powerful shock wave through his body.

The man shouts out before falling backwards in his chair and only just manages to stay upright.

He then cries out in pain while rubbing his leg - much to the amusement of his fellow drinkers.

But his friend's laughs soon turn sour - as the shocked man zaps his arm.

Get your own back: Having suffered a fair few shocks, the Australian gets his revenge by zapping his friend

He laughs and screams while rubbing his shocked arm moments before his drinking buddy zaps him again.

The frivolity continues as the pair shock one another, while mocking the other's reaction.

And when one of the pair puts the device down on the bar, the other takes his opportunity - grabbing the device and shocking his friend.

At one point the pain obviously gets too much for one of the drinkers as he dramatically falls backwards off his bar stool and lands on the floor - much to the amusement of those around him.
