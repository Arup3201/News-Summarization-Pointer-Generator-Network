A weekend of violence has seen 18 people shot in Chicago, including a 15-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.

A total of 15 shootings happened between Saturday night and Sunday morning, with two happening earlier on Saturday and another on Friday.

So far no arrests have been made in connection with any of the attacks, many of which are thought to be gang related.

In a weekend of violence 18 people have been shot in Chicago including three teenagers. A total of 15 victims were shot in just seven hours between Saturday night and Sunday morning

On Friday at 6.37pm a 15-year-old boy was shot in the neck while walking with a friend in the South Side Calumet Heights neighborhood.

He was taken to the University of Chicago Comer Children’s Hospital in stable condition while friend was uninjured, police said.

In another shooting a 16-year-old girl was hit in the ankle along with two men aged 19 and 21, who were all taken to hospital in a stable condition.  

According to police the shooting, which happened on Sunday at around 1.15am, may have been gang related.

Some of the most serious violence happened in 20 minutes on Sunday morning when one man was left in critical condition, and two more were reported to be in serious condition after being shot in a separate incident.

In the first attack a 21-year-old was shot in the head in a drive-by attack at 2.10am while walking on the 1600 block of 46th Place.

Around 20 minutes later a 33-year-old man was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital after being shot in the foot and back, while a 25-year-old was taken to Stroger Hospital after being shot in the back. A third 36-year-old was shot in the thigh and backside, but was in a stable condition.

The trio had been standing in the street when two men jumped out of a car and opened fire with handguns, according to police reports.

It is the second time in two months that the city has seen 18 people shot, while it is just four months since 30 were injured and six were killed including a seven-year-old boy

A fourth man was also in serious condition after being shot at around 4am on Saturday.

The 21-year-old had been standing on the sidewalk after a party when he was hit in the left leg.

The oldest victim of the violence was a 48-year-old who suffered a shoulder wound after being approached while trying to get into a property by two armed men. 

The three men grappled on the doorstep before the victim was shot in the shoulder and the thugs ran off.

Another man was shot on Saturday night by a masked man, a second was shot early Sunday morning while out walking, and the two most recent victims were attacked at 4am on Sunday.

News of the shootings follows on from the death of Javier Gonzalez, 17, a known gang member, whose unconscious body was found by police officers after being shot in the back of the head and shoulder on Thursday.

The teenager was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition but died of his wounds on Friday afternoon.

The recent spate of bloodshed marks the second weekend in two months where there have been 18 shootings on a single weekend in Chicago.

On that occasion, between September 20 and 22, four people were killed and another 14 injured.

According to data compiled by Redeye, there were an average of five murders per weekend in Chicago between 2007 and 2012.

The highest number recorded in that time was over the Independence Day weekend of 2012, when 12 people were killed.
