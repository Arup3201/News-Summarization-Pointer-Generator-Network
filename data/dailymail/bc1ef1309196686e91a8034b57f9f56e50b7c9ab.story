With England needing Italy to beat Costa Rica to keep their slim World Cup hopes alive, Gary Lineker has shown his support by wearing an Azzurri shirt.

The Presenter opened BBC's coverage of the Italians clash while wearing the jersey as the whole of England gets behind Mario Balotelli and Co.

Former England frontman Lineker tweeted a picture of pundits Clarence Seedorf, Thierry Henry and Alan Hansen in the studio and wrote: 'Come on Italy.'

Following the Three Lions' 2-1 defeat to Uruguay on Thursday night, Roy Hodgson's side can only progress by beating Costa Rica in the final group game while hoping Italy win their two remaining games.

Amusingly, Italy frontman Balotelli has delivered his demands should he aid England's progression - a kiss from the Queen!

He tweeted: 'If we beat Costa Rica I want a kiss, obviously on the cheek, from the UK Queen.'

Balotelli scored the winner when Italy beat England last week and leads the line again in Recife.
