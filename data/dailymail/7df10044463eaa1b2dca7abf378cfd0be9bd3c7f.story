A shocked woman woke up in the middle of the night to find herself being fondled by a drunken intruder as her husband lay asleep next to her in bed.

The couple were sleeping when Saeem Ullah, 33, from Haslingden, Lancashire, shinned up a drainpipe and sneaked into their bedroom before getting under the bed clothes.

The woman, who is in her early 40s and cannot be named for legal reasons, awoke to find Ullah touching her bottom and 'cupping' her private parts and alerted her husband. 

Moments later Ullah was marched out of the property by the victim's angry husband - who was unaware at the time that his wife had been groped.

The husband later told police that had he known the full extent of what happened the intruder 'wouldn't have got out.'

Ullah, was drunk at the time of the incident and and managed to clamber into the couple's home through a bathroom window.

At Burnley Crown Court, he admitted sexual assault and was jailed for two years and ordered to sign the sexual offenders register for 10 years. 

His counsel Robert Kearney said on the night of the offence in June last year, Ullah, who suffers from epilepsy, had been drunk and thought there was a party at the house.

Mr Kearney said: 'Clearly, there was nothing going on, but foolishly, he entered the property. 

'He accepts he shouldn't have gone in there. He wandered around the house for 10 minutes or so.'

Mr Kearney said Ullah went into the bedroom, the husband and wife were in bed and he 'made advances,' towards the woman. 

He said: 'He can't really have been thinking straight about the consequences of what had gone on. 

'He is sorry for what's gone on and he asks me to apologise to the court and to the complainant.'

'I can say this is an offence which is totally out of character for this defendant. This was a short-lived incident and there was no injury to the complainant.

'This is a serious offence and I don't belittle it, but sometimes women of more mature years can deal better with circumstances such as this. 

'We hope this plea and sentence will go a significant way towards the victim putting this offence behind her.'

Mr Kearney said Ullah came from a 'decent' family and added: ' The defendant is ashamed of what he's done and the problems he has brought upon his family and his family's name. 

'When he is released he wants to put right that wrong and when he is released, he hopes to get back to gainful employment.'

Passing sentence Judge Beverley Lunt said: 'It's a very bizarre set of circumstances, but extremely upsetting for this lady and indeed her partner who was also in bed. 

'I can't even begin to understand what feelings she must have gone through when she woke that night to find you indecently assaulting her, with her husband next to her in bed. 

'I wonder if she slept much for weeks afterwards.'
