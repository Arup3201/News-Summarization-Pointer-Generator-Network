A macabre selection of personal items that once belonged to former Boston crime boss James 'Whitey' Bulger are due to be auctioned off to raise funds for his victims.

The lists of belongings to be sold includes jewelry, clothing and a boxing mannequin that Bulger used to leave propped near the window of his apartment to make it look as though there was someone keeping lookout.

The U.S. Marshals Service is set to go ahead with the sale despite some concerns that it may be perceived as glorifying the convicted mobster if items of little value are included.

The U.S. Marshals Service is set to auction off many of the items seized from Bulger's California apartment after his arrest two years ago, including a boxer mannequin

Bulger, right, was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month and now his belongings are due to be sold with the proceeds going to his victims

‘The reality is there are lots of people who would be willing to pay money for some or all of the contents of that apartment, and that money is going to victims and victims' families. So we want to do what we can to get as much money as we can for them,’ First Assistant US Attorney Jack Pirozzolo told The Boston Globe.

Officials believe the highest-value items include a claddagh ring estimated to be worth $48,000 and Bulger's replica 1986 Stanley Cup championship ring valued at about $3,000.

Other items include binoculars, a telescope, camouflage clothing, nine fedoras, 27 pairs of sunglasses, ceramic poodle salt and pepper shakers, assorted porcelain cats and hundreds of books, many with Bulger's handwritten notes scrawled in the margins.

There's also a McCain/Palin campaign button and a God Bless America poster.

The items, including a selection of mobster-related books were found when police raided Bulger's apartment at the Princess Eugenia complex, in Santa Monica, California

Authorities said they're trying to be sensitive to the victims in the case and have yet to decide whether it is appropriate to cash in on Bulger's notoriety by selling some of the other items, ranging from his blue and white dinnerware to his size 9.5 sneakers.

The items due to be auctioned off were seized from Bulger's California apartment after his arrest two years ago.

The 84-year-old Bulger was sentenced 
this month to life in prison. He was found guilty in August by a federal
jury in 11 of the 19 killings he was accused of, along with dozens of 
other gangland crimes, including shakedowns and money laundering.

The profits will be split among the families of those who were killed by Bulger.

Two relatives of Bulger victims backed the effort to get as much money as possible.

Authorities have said that they're trying to be sensitive to the victims and have yet to decide whether it is appropriate to cash in on Bulger's notoriety by selling all of the items

‘If they can sell anything he owned down to a ballpoint pen, then good luck to them,’ said Patricia Donahue, whose husband, Michael Donahue, was shot to death by Bulger in 1982 while giving a ride home to a man who was being targeted. ‘I'm sure the victims could use the money.’

'They are trying to do the right thing,' said Tim Connors, whose father was gunned down by Bulger in 1975.

Jason Wojdylo, chief inspector of the asset forfeiture division of the U.S. Marshals Service, said the U.S. attorney's office will decide what to sell.

After the court approves a sale, it usually takes up to 60 days to schedule an auction, he said.

Bulger fled Boston in 1994 after being tipped off by his former FBI handler that he was about to be indicted, and he remained a fugitive for more than 16 years until he was captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011.
