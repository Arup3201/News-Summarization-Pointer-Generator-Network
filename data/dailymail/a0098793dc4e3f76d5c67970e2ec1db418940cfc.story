I have sensitive eyes and always struggle to find a decent, affordable eye make-up remover. Which ones do you recommend?

Jane, 56, Ayrshire.

Eye make-up remover is one of the biggest unsung heroes on our bathroom shelves. Even if you wear only mascara, you still need something to take it off effectively without irritating your eyes.

Many women struggle to find an eye make-up remover that is both effective and good for their skin (picture posed by model) 

Dr Hilary Allan, cosmetic dermatologist at Woodford Medical (woodfordmedical.com), advises trying make-up removers containing botanical ingredients, and staying away from fragranced formulations as they can irritate.

‘Micellar cleansing waters are water-based cleansers containing molecules that act like magnets, lifting away make-up and impurities from the skin,’ she says.

‘They tend to work well for sensitive eyes as they’re gently formulated.’

The new Garnier Pure Active Micellar Cleansing Water, (£3.33, Boots) is unperfumed and suitable for sensitive skin.

Sally Penford, education manager at the International Dermal Institute, says: ‘It’s always better to use a specialised product for the eyes rather than an ordinary cleanser, as these products are specially tested for use on the thin skin of this very delicate area.

‘A water-soluble oil is best for removing heavy eye make-up and waterproof mascara.

‘A gel is particularly good for people who wear glasses, contact lenses or have sensitive eyes because they are light, gentle and won’t leave a residue on the eyes.’ You don’t have to break the bank with eye make-up removers.

Here are my top budget options that are as easy on the purse as they are on the eyes:

Bourjois Maxi Format Express Eye Make-Up Remover (£5, Tesco)

Bourjois Maxi Format Express Eye Make-Up Remover (£5, Tesco)

This non-greasy formula removes heavy, smoky eye make-up, liner and waterproof mascara without having to rub the sensitive eye area.

One saturated cotton pad gets everything off in one swipe. This is the best value of all the ones I tried — the 250ml version will last for ages. 10/10

L’Oreal Paris Dermo-Expertise Gentle Eye Make-Up Remover (£2.53, Boots)

L’Oreal Paris Dermo-Expertise Gentle Eye Make-Up Remover (£2.53, Boots)

An eye make-up remover that has been designed for those with particularly sensitive eyes and those who wear contact lenses. Though it isn’t good for removing waterproof mascara, it is refreshing and soothing and it won’t irritate. 9/10

Waitrose Pure Eye Make-up Remover (£1.99, Waitrose)

Waitrose Pure Eye Make-up Remover (£1.99, Waitrose)

Pure is a well-priced skincare range from Waitrose and the eye make-up remover is gentle and effective, even getting rid of waterproof eyeliner. This is not 100 per cent organic, but at this price, I won’t hold that against it as it’s gentle, which is what we’re looking for. 9/10

Halo Eye Make-Up Remover Pads (£1.50, Superdrug)

Halo Eye Make-Up Remover Pads (£1.50, Superdrug)

These hypoallergenic and fragrance-free pads are handy if you’re travelling and they are also fabulous for removing morning-after panda eyes if you failed to cleanse properly before going to bed. They’re great value, as they work out at only 5p per pad. They didn’t irritate my eyes or leave oily residue. Keep in your handbag to repair mascara smudges during the day. 8/10

MONDAY MASTER CLASS: TWO-MINUTE BROWLIFT

Big, bushy brows are fashionable, but what do you do if yours have become thinner and shorter over the years?

I went to make-up artists Sam and Nic Chapman, the top-rated YouTube beauty gurus with millions of subscribers to their Pixiwoo channel, for a lesson in the two-minute brow lift.

‘The aim is to get real-looking brows that don’t look stencilled on,’ says Sam.

‘If you are using a pencil, make sure it is sharp or you won’t get the fine, feathery strokes you need. And you don’t want to draw lines that are too thick and end up with caterpillar brows.’

First, Sam applied a neutral shade of shadow, Maybelline Color Tattoo eye shadow in Strip Nude (£4.99, Boots), all over the lid using an oval shadow brush (£15, Real Techniques Bold Metals Collection, Boots). Its full, round shape makes it easy to apply shadow quickly.

Next, Sam used a pointed crease brush (£12) to apply a darker brown shadow along the lash line and into the socket and then blended it in.

‘As we age, the lids droop, so doing this gives the illusion of a brow lift,’ she says.

The next step is to brush your brows into shape — upwards to give an arched look.

They used Maybelline Brow Drama sculpting mascara (£4.99, Boots), which is a tinted gel that sets your brows. Colour is key: avoid too dark or too gingery.

The finishing touch is to apply a tiny amount of gel brow mousse — Anastasia Beverly Hills Dip Brow Pommade (£15, Cult Beauty) applied with an angled liner brush (£10), which can be used for liner and to fill in sparse brows.

This brush’s firm, slanted head allows you to get really close to the lash line, and it is also excellent for painting tiny fine strokes into your brows, making them look thicker and fuller.

If you buy only one make-up brush, make it this one.
