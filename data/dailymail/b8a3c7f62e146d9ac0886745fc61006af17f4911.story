If you are bored of the plethora of copycat Flappy Bird games appearing in app stores and are growing tired of the addictive original, you could harness your creativity and make your own version of game.

That's just what one New York-based hacker did by building a DIY shoebox version of the best-selling app using a handful of basic electrical components.

Fawn Qiu used an Arduino sensor, two servo motors, a reed switch and magnets, all hidden inside a cardboard box to create her mechanical marvel.

Flappy Bird caused a sensation after rising out of obscurity to become one of the most downloaded mobile games on both Apple and Google's online stores.

Users have to steer a bird between green pipes.

The Android version was downloaded up to 50 million times, and attracted more than half a million reviews.

It also topped the Apple download charts, although figures have not been released for the iOS version.

But of course she also had to use her artistic skills too to make the coloured backdrop for the game.

The U.S.-based engineer and founder of Make Anything put the project together to prove that it is possible for most people to engineer their own version of the game, Sploid reported.

The clever mechanism means that the Flappy Bird scenery rolls and rolls as a player dodges the green tubes by tapping on the sensitive pad – a little like gamers tap on their smartphone screen.

If players make a mistake and hit a tube, it's game over and the lid of the shoebox slams shut so that they have to start afresh.

Demonstrating the continuing demand for the game, one viewer of Ms Qiu’s YouTube video that shows people playing on the bulky game said: ‘If you’re selling this, I’ll buy it’.

Following the sudden disappearance of the original Flappy Bird app on Apple and Google’s app stores, imitations of Flappy Bird popped up everywhere, after its creator confirmed that the original game is ‘gone forever’.

Nguyen Ha Dong, the developer who pulled his highly successful and profitable app, revealed he did so because he thinks it was too addictive.

The Vietnamese Hanoi-based developer is believed to have walked away from a small fortune as it is estimated he could have made $50,000 every day in in-app advertising alone.

He told Forbes that he created the app - which saw players tapping on their smartphone screen to navigate a pixelated birds though narrow pipes - to be played in a few minutes, in his first interview since he took his game away.

It happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem,’ he said.

‘To solve that problem, it’s best to take down Flappy Bird. It’s gone forever.’

Flappy Bird was the most popular free mobile game on Apple App Store and Google's Android Play store.
