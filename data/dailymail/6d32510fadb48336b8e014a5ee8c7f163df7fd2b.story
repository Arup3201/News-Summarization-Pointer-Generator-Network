An Italian judge is leading a radical scheme to try and break the grip of the mafia by taking their children away from them before they become part of the family business.

Roberto di Bella, president of the juvenile court in Reggio Calabria in southern Italy, says the drastic measure is the only way to tackle mafia gangs because they are built around family ties.

'We needed to find a way to break this cycle that transmits negative cultural values from father to son,' he toldÂ the BBC.

Calabria is home of the increasingly notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia. Less well-known than other crime families, it is now believed to be the 
most powerful in Italy, controlling much of the drug trade into Europe 
through South America.

After a huge crackdown in 2011, 110 mobsters were jailed for a total of more than 1,000 years.

But the gang's stranglehold on the impoverished region remains strong.

Police have found it particularly hard to penetrate the 'Ndrangheta because it is family-based and informers are rare.

With this in mind, Judge di Bella felt compelled to take an alternative approach to combating organised crime.

He had begun to see a number of boys in his court who were the sons of mafia bosses he had sentenced in the Nineties.

Instead of seeing them follow in the 
inevitable footsteps of their fathers, he made the decision to start 
taking them away from their families.

'As president of the court, I took some decisions,' he told the BBC.

He
began taking a keen interest in the children of well-known mafia 
families aged around 14 or 15 who had 'started to acquire the mafiosi 
mentality' as Di Bella puts it.

Around 15 children - mostly boys - have been taken away so far and placed in care homes.

They are no in prison and can visit their families at weekends.

Di Bella says the courts are focusing on boys who are involved in low-level crimes such as stealing or vandalism and their families show little interest.

'Our objective is to show these young
men a different world from the one they grew up in,' he says. 'If you 
are a boy whose father, uncle or grandfather is a mafioso, then there's 
no-one who can set rules - and we provide them with a context.'

The
intention is that intervening early will encourage the youngsters to 
choose not to follow a life of crime through their own volition.

When they are 18, they can return to their families and it will be their own decision.

But it will not be an easy choice, as 'Ndrangheta expert Antonio Nicaso explains.

The
'Ndrangheta, based in Calabria in the far south of Italy, is now 
believed to be the most powerful of Italy's four mafia organisations.

They have grown from a rural mob to a brand-name international criminal syndicate.

In the past decade, the 'Ndrangheta
has emerged as a powerful and aggressive organization, becoming one of 
the world's biggest cocaine traffickers.

The origins of the 'Ndrangheta are 
thought to date back to shortly after Italian unification in 1861 when 
secret societies were established in Calabria.

The group confined its activities 
to Calabria until the 1970s, after which it began to target rich 
businessmen and their relatives for ransom kidnappings in northern 
Italy.

The organisation turned its attention to drugs in the 1990s, importing cocaine from Colombia and distributing it around Europe.

Police have found it hard to penetrate the 'Ndrangheta because it is family-based and Informers are rare.

However, last year police arrested around 300 alleged Mafiosi, dealing the organisation a major blow.

Italy's Eurispes institute has 
estimated that the 'Ndrangheta's turnover from trafficking in drugs and 
arms, prostitution and extortion amounts to more than 40 billion euros a
year - the equivalent of three percent of Italy's gross domestic 
product.

'There's a religious baptism and a 
mafioso baptism, which is confirmed when you reach a certain age,' he told the BBC.

'So this means that, often, the children of bosses - particularly the 
first-born - are predestined to follow in their father's footsteps.'

The programme is still in an experimental stage, but if successful it will be rolled out in other parts of Italy.
