Guilty: Tyler Holder, 18, pleaded guilty to charges of murdering his 6-year-old neighbor last year. He was sentenced to life in prison

An 18-year-old man will spend the rest of his life in prison, after admitting to the murder of his 6-year-old neighbor whose body was found dumped on a street corner last summer.

Tyler Holder plead guilty on Thursday to charges of murder in the death of his young neighbor Alanna Gallagher, who went missing last June. 

Her body was found soon after less then a mile away from her Saginaw, Texas home and an autopsy report revealed the little girl had been raped.

Holder, who was 17 at the time, was arrested when his DNA was found on her body. 

In exchange for pleading guilty, Holder got a life in prison sentence. He will also serve 40 years for shooting at a police officer during his arrest, and 20 years for setting a car on fire a week after Alanna's killing.

Alanna mother Laura gave a statement at the sentencing, saying Holder won't be able to hurt any more children but 'it does not repay for what you have done'.

'It does not bring her back to us. No matter how much suffering you undergo in prison, it won’t be as much as all the people who knew and loved Alanna have been, and will continue to be suffering,' Laura Gallagher said. 'I hope you remember this, and that you live with shame for what you have done, every day that you live, every day that Alanna is gone from us.'

Alanna was the daughter of Laura Gallagher and her husband Karl. The couple also lived with a man named Miles McDaniel as part of a polyamorous relationship.  

'There are no more relaxed Saturday morning snuggles with her, filled with talk and giggles,' Mrs Gallagher continued in the statement. 'I will never again get to go wake her first on a school morning, because she always woke the most cheerfully — I’d tickle her toes and say "Good morning, toes!" and she’d laugh and say "Good morning, Mama!!" and come help wake her siblings.

Tragic: 6-year-old Alanna Gallagher's body was found less than a mile from her home, where she went missing last summer

'Our house is emptier, and quieter, and sadder. We carry around a heavy hard stone of pain where our hearts used to be. And it’s your fault.'

Little Alanna's body was found the evening of July 1, 2013, inside a silver tarp that was dropped on a street corner less than a mile from her house. 

Investigators found her body inside, wrapped in a black trash bag with her head covered in plastic sacks and secured with tape wrapped around her neck.

Police questioned Holder the day after, since he lived with his mother just two houses away from the Gallagher family. 

He said he hadn't seen her, and agreed to submit to a DNA test a few days later. 

When that DNA sample matched that found on Alanna's body, police took out an arrest warrant and showed up at Holder's house. 

Holder responded violently and initiated a shootout with authorities, seriously injured Officer Charles Lodotto with a bullet. 

The teen suspect was also shot in the neck during the fight,and he posed for his mugshot with a bandage on his throat. 

'Today a dangerous killer was brought to justice,' Deputy Chief District Attorney Bob Gill said in a news release on Thursday. 'Tyler Holder will never pose a danger to another child. The family of Alanna Gallagher and Officer Charles Lodatto are very satisfied with this resolution of the cases.'

Holder will also serve a 40 year sentence for shooting a police officer who was trying to arrest him. The area where Alanna's body was found pictured above
