Liverpool trained at Harvard University on Monday with Loic Remy on his way out to the US to join his future team-mates.

The Reds have agreed a fee of around £8million with QPR for the France international, who will have his medical across the pond before the deal is officially confirmed on Wednesday.

Remy will then be in contention to feature in the four fixtures Liverpool have scheduled in the US.

Captain Steven Gerrard was among those training at Harvard - one of world's best universities - on the day he announced his retirement from international football with England.

Liverpool take on Roma in Boston at 12.30am (BST) on July 24, before fixtures against Olympiacos, Manchester City and AC Milan in Chicago, New York and Charlotte respectively.

Whether or not Remy plays in those games appears academic with the transfer all but done.
