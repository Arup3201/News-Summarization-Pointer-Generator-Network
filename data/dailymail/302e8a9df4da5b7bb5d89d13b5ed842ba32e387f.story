A young dental nurse found dead outside her sister’s house is believed to have frozen to death in the snow.

Bernadette Lee should have  been staying with a friend after a  night out, but went to her older sister Jodie’s instead.

Finding the house empty, it appears that she either slipped and banged her head, or that she fell asleep and succumbed to the freezing temperatures, which dropped below minus 2C.

The 25-year-old’s body was discovered by a dog walker early on Sunday, hours after she was seen at a local nightclub. She was wearing only a dress, with no coat, and had taken off her shoes.

Her sister Jodie, 33, said: ‘She was an amazing girl, she was so pretty and had everything to live for. Bernie loved life, was an adventurous traveller and had just started her own business doing teeth whitening. We are devastated, and can’t comprehend this terrible, terrible tragedy.’

Miss Lee said her sister had travelled from her home in Canterbury, Kent, to a friend’s flat where they had all got ready for a night out on Saturday. The group of friends had gone to a popular nightclub in Deal, Kent, but as the evening wore on they had become separated.

Miss Lee said: ‘We were all having a good time and having quite a few drinks, but I thought she was staying with her friend as all her clothes were there. I came home but had lost my door key so went to stay with a friend.

‘She must have come back to my house 
after me – it’s just awful. I don’t understand why she didn’t ring me or
 knock on the neighbours’ doors. Nobody knows what happened and I fear 
we never will.’

Thick snow blanketed Deal at the weekend, and temperatures in the early hours of Sunday plunged to minus 2.2C (28F).

Alcohol increases blood flow to the 
outer areas of the body, decreasing core body temperature, so Miss Lee 
would have been more susceptible to hypothermia.

Her father Roger, 63, said he was devastated at the death of his ‘beautiful little girl’.

Mr Lee, a retired labourer, said: ‘The police told me she was wearing just a dress, no coat, and didn’t have her shoes on.

‘Someone must have dropped her off 
outside Jodie’s house as apparently she didn’t have money for a taxi and
 she couldn’t have walked. Who would leave a girl on her own, without 
seeing that they had got into the house safely? I want to know who left 
her there.

‘One of the friends Bernadette was out
 with came to see me yesterday. She said she felt so guilty because 
Bernadette had called her after they’d got separated, but she’d been 
arguing with her boyfriend and hadn’t answered.

‘After that she must have gone to her 
sister’s. I just wish Bernadette had phoned me. I would have come 
straight round to get her.

‘I would have done anything for my daughter. I loved her so much – everybody did. She was a very popular girl, a lovely girl.’

He said Bernadette and Jodie had lived
 with him when they were growing up, and Bernadette had been a 
successful gymnast, winning a number of gold medals as a child.

Hundreds of friends left messages on a
 Facebook tribute page. Her half-brother Luke wrote: ‘I was closer to 
you than anyone on this earth, words could never be enough to describe 
how proud mum and I were of the beautiful person you’d become.

‘You’ll have the most special place in
 our hearts now and for all of time. Heartbroken for the moments I’ll 
never get to share with you, privileged for the ones I did.’

A spokesman for Kent Police said: ‘We 
think it is probably a tragic accident. Police found no evidence of any 
suspicious activity.

‘We think she either collapsed because
 she was too drunk or she slipped on the snow and couldn’t get up and 
lost consciousness because it was so cold or she had a medical episode.’

A post-mortem examination is due to take place this week to establish the cause of death.

WHAT IS IT?

Hypothermia occurs when a person's body temperature drops below 35°C (95°F); normal body temperature is around 37°C (98.6°F).

When the body gets cold it, tries to prevent losing more heat by shivering (which keeps the major organs at normal temperature), restricting blood flow to the skin and releasing hormones to generate heat.

But these responses use up energy and may not be enough to maintain body temperature if it is exposed to the cold for a long time. 

When the body runs out of energy, it gradually begins to shut down. Shivering stops and the heartbeat begins to slow. Eventually, it stops. 

WHAT CAUSES IT? 

As well as being caused by cold and windy weather - and not wearing enough warm clothing - there are other factors that can trigger or exacerbate it.

Getting wet is a major factor as water conducts heat away from the body 25 times faster than air.

Drinking alcohol is another major contributor, says Joe Mulligan, head of first aid education at the British Red Cross. 'Alcohol widens the blood vessels, so more blood - and therefore heat - goes to the surface of the skin and is lost from the body.

'In fact, the moderate stage of alcohol intoxication is similar to the intermediate stages of hypothermia and are often confused,' he explains. 'If someone is hypothermic, they may appear confused, disorientated and irritated.'

SYMPTOMS

The symptoms of severe hypothermia (a body temperature of below 28˚C) can include:     unconsciousness (comatose), shallow or no breathing, weak, irregular or no pulse and dilated pupils.
