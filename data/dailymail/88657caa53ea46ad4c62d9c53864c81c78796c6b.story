A fraternity at North Carolina State University was placed on interim suspension after it was linked to a pledge book containing jokes about rape and lynching. 

Pi Kappa Phi suspended its chapter at NC State until an investigation about a green book that was found at a restaurant near the school's Raleigh campus is complete. 

The school is cracking down on more than 20 other fraternities by temporarily suspending social events that involve alcohol. 

Pi Kappa Phi suspended its chapter at North Carolina State University after a book containing jokes about rape and lynching was found by a female student at a restaurant near the school's campus in Raleigh. 

The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like: 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching'

Besides the lynching line, the book contained the phrase: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' 

The contents of the Pi Kappa Phi notebook were first broadcast by television station WRAL. 

The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like 'If she's hot enough, she doesn't need a pulse.' and 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching.'

It also contained the comments: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' and 'I like little girls.'

The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant.

She said: 'The contents were horrible.

'I wanted to make sure everybody knew this was going on so it could be corrected.

'Frats are looked up to, but this is what they are doing.

'I hope other fraternities are disgusted.

'I hope that if they do have this sort of thing going on in theirs, that they'll realize, whether they want to or not, that they should change, that they shouldn't promote this kind of behavior.'

Frat said: 'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated'

Pi Kappa Phi chief executive officer Mark Timmes called the quotes 'reprehensible and unacceptable'.

He said: 'We have sent staff to Raleigh to investigate the circumstances of the situation.

'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated.

'We are working closely with the university and have instructed our students to cooperate fully with all investigation efforts.

'We appreciate the university's collaboration in quickly addressing the situation.' 

NC State's alcohol ban doesn't apply to historically black Greek organizations or the Multicultural Greek Council

It was issued after new details about a drug paraphernalia seizure surfaced in a search warrant related to a sexual assault allegation at Alpha Tau Omega, which was suspended earlier this month.

The chapter will be suspended until an investigation about the 'reprehensible' quotes in the book is complete 

The details came out not long after shocking behavior at the University of Oklahoma, Penn State and other schools put fraternities in the spotlight. 

In announcing the alcohol crackdown, NC. State said the school also plans training on diversity for chapters and other measures to increase accountability.

In the Alpha Tau Omega investigation, a woman called police March 1 to say she was sexually assaulted at the fraternity house. 

She also told officers drugs - including cocaine, ecstasy and prescription pills - were being sold out of the house.

Alpha Tau Omega's NC State chapter was suspended earlier this month amid allegations of sexual assault

Campus police Sgt. J.P. Dye seized drug paraphernalia, a scale and white powder in a small bag during a search of the empty house. 

Wynn Smiley, Alpha Tau Omega's national chief executive officer, said the fraternity had kicked out a pledge who had white powder and other drug paraphernalia in his room.

The student had been associated with the organization for less than a month, Smiley said.

He said the national organization conducted its own investigation with a lawyer and other alumni advisers, and the organization believes the woman was exaggerating about drugs being sold and the level of drug activity.

He also questioned her credibility on the sexual assault allegation. 

Smiley said: 'It just didn't line up with what we were finding out.'

Kayle Graham, a junior psychology major at NC State, said racism and sexism among students is sad because the younger generation's attitude indicates where the country is heading.

She said: 'It's unfortunate that at a college level, students aren't as mature and socially aware as one would like them to be.'
