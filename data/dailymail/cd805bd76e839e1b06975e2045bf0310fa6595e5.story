Millions of New Yorkers were today struggling to go about their normal day after one of the busiest cities in the world was brought to its knees by one of the biggest storm's in its history.

The city that never sleeps spent the night at a virtual standstill and cloaked in darkness, waking up today to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy which has so far claimed the lives of 18 people and caused what is expected to be $20billion of damage.

As daylight finally illuminated the streets this morning, New Yorkers were faced with a flooded subway, shuttered financial markets, closed schools, deserted streets and many homes still without power after a night which saw a wall of sea water and high winds slam into the city.

Buildings were destroyed, tunnels going into and out of Manhattan were flooded, dozens of trees and power lines were felled and thousands had fled from their homes.

Some would have no homes to return to after at least 50 in the Queens area flooded and caught fire.

This morning, there were police officers on every corner, patrol cars circling the neighborhoods on the lookout for looters and casualties.

Traffic lights were down and streets and subways were eerily empty. Those on the streets seemed confused as to what to do and how to go about it. High above midtown, the broken boom of a crane continued to dangle precariously over a neighborhood.

The city's subway, which is 108 years old, has never faced a disaster as devastating as last night, an MTA spokesman said today.

'We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations,' Mayor Michael Bloomberg said today. 'This is a once-in-a-long-time storm.'

From 8pm last night, lower Manhattan was bathed in darkness as the power went out from one neighborhood to another like a domino effect. Soon after, the city's cell phone networks stopped working leaving people in virtual obscurity.

'We see a pop. The whole sky lights up,' said Dani Hart, 30, who was watching the storm from the roof of her building in the Navy Yards.

'It sounded like the Fourth of July,' Stephen Weisbrot said from his powerless 10th-floor apartment.'It's really a complete ghost town now.'

Alice Goldberg, 15, a tourist from Paris, was watching television in her hotel when a voice came over the loudspeaker and told everyone to leave.

'They said to take only what we needed, and leave the rest, because we'll come back in two or three days,' she said as she and hundreds of others gathered in the luggage-strewn marble lobby. 'I hope so.'

It could be several days to a week before all residents who lost power during the storm get their lights back, officials said.

In the early hours of Tuesday morning, it was like a tale of two cities. In uptown Manhattan, windows of apartments and businesses glowed and curious faces peered from windows, eager to see the damage.

But to cross through midtown was to be swallowed by darkness. Only a few emergency or backup lights appeared in buildings. Further downtown, only the flicker of candlelight could be seen from windows, the usually bustling financial district was both flooded with water and cloaked in darkness.

Even though the worst of the storm had passed, authorities warned people to be on the alert when moving around today for falling debris, felled trees and downed power lines.

'This will be one for the record 
books,' said John Miksad, senior vice president for electric operations 
at Consolidated Edison. 'This will be the largest storm-related outage 
in our history.'

'Folks 
don't realize that this is the most dangerous time,' Irene K. Asbury, a 
municipal prosecutor for the town of West New York, told Yahoo! Shine.

'Your
guard is down, you think your family is safe, the storm is over... then
you step on a rusty nail, a branch falls on you during cleanup, or you 
wade through a puddle and there is a live wire.'

'It’s the worst I’ve seen,' said David Arnold, watching the storm from his home in Long Branch, N.J. 'The ocean is in the road, there are trees down everywhere. I’ve never seen it this bad.'

'We are at the mercy of the MTA -- our staff has to be able to get to work -- and Con Ed,' restaurateur Drew Nieporent wrote in an e-mail to Businessweek. His Tribeca Grill flooded and he’s waiting in New Jersey without power, to hear how Nobu and Corton fared in the storm.

'As the storm has come and gone, time will tell how we all fared, the degree of damage suffered, the amount of lives sadly lost to this natural disaster and  how long it will take before the city that never sleeps resumes being the be-all and end-all for so many of us.' 'Scallywag' blogger
