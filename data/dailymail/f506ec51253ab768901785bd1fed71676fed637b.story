It could be the perfect stocking filler for travellers, a calendar that tells them the best time to travel to top destinations around the world.

The 2015 diary highlights when it is cheapest to visit certain destinations, along with average hotel prices for each month.

While New York is most costly in September, October and December, February and March are the peak months for Sydney, while London hikes prices in June and July. 

Trivago created travel advice calendars for popular destinations, showing the most and least expensive months to travel. Pictured: London, where the best savings are to be had in January, February and March

For those thinking of heading to the Big Apple, booking in August instead of June could yield major savings

To create the calendar, Trivago compared hotel price data from 45 countries across six continents to determine just which were the cheapest and most expensive months to visit. 

And the potential for savings is absolutely huge - as much as £130 per night in Venice, for example, simply by visiting in January instead of May.

While Amsterdam is more expensive in May, hotels are up to £74 cheaper in January, while July is the cheapest month for Bangkok, compared to a peak time of December. 

Trivago has put together handy colour-coded calendars for each of the cities examined to advise travellers when to book.

The averages are calculated based on data from over 700,000 hotels on over 175 booking sites over the last three years. 

They've also put together a handy chart analysing the ten most popular destinations for UK travellers - just in case you were looking for some destination inspiration.

When the weather starts to cool in the UK, great September travel savings are still to be had in Australia

Denise Bartlett, of Trivago's Public Relations UK, said: 'Seasonal differences obviously play a large part in price trends - hotel prices in many European destinations are at their lowest in January and highest in warmer months.

'However, the travel advice calendars show that waiting just two months to book a break in Paris - from June to August - could potentially save travellers up to £61 a night.

'The maximum potential savings in Venice is an average of £130 per night - a significant amount of money in one of Europe's most expensive cities.'
