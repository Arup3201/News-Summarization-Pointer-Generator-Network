Legal action: Karin Ward is facing being taken to court by Freddie Starr after claiming he groped her

A woman who faces being taken to court by Freddie Starr over her claim that  he groped her said yesterday: ‘Sue me – I haven’t  got any money.’

Karin Ward, whose testimony was pivotal in exposing Jimmy Savile, is facing a High Court defamation claim for £300,000 because she also accused comedian Starr of groping her.

The 55-year-old – who has been recovering from cancer – says Starr molested her when she was a schoolgirl in Jimmy Savile’s dressing room in 1974.

Yesterday a furious Miss Ward said she would repeat her claims on oath – and that even if he won, she had nothing worth taking.

 ‘He can sue me, take everything I haven’t got – that’s fine, I couldn’t care less,’ she told  the Daily Mail. ‘What can he do  to me? My house is rented, my car is worth £25.

‘What’s he going to do – have me declared bankrupt?’

The mother of seven last year spoke on camera in the ITV documentary that brought Savile’s abuse to public attention.

She also claimed on the programme that Starr had ‘wandering hands’ and had groped her in the dressing room of Savile’s Clunk Click TV show when she was 15.

Starr, 70, initially denied appearing on the show or meeting her. When footage emerged showing her standing behind him on Clunk Click, he was forced to admit he was ‘mistaken’ but still denied the ‘awful allegation’ of abuse.

Miss Ward has also recounted in an internet blog and her self- published autobiography how a comedian referred to as ‘F’ had hands which ‘wandered incessantly’. She wrote that ‘F’ was furious when she rebuffed him and made an ‘exceptionally cruel remark about my lack of breasts’, namely: ‘I wouldn’t touch you anyway, you’re a ***less wonder!’

Starr – who has not been charged over allegations of historic sexual abuse – has now launched a legal claim accusing her of defaming him as a paedophile.

In a highly unusual move, the father of five – who maintains  his innocence of the claims – is seeking £300,000 to cover lost  theatre bookings as well as an injunction to stop Miss Ward repeating her allegations.

On film: The 55-year old is in yellow sitting behind Starr during an appearance on BBC TV show Clunk Click in 1974, hosted by Jimmy Savile.

At her housing association home in Oswestry, Shropshire, yesterday, Miss Ward, whose car is a 15-year-old Vauxhall Astra, said she stood by all her claims about Starr but insisted she had never called him a paedophile.

‘I wasn’t upset because he attempted to grope me,’ she said. ‘That’s what men did, you could walk down the street and have your bottom pinched.

‘It was normal behaviour for men to grab your boobs – that’s not what upset me.

Denial: Starr, 70, initially said he did not appear on the show and claimed to have not met Miss Ward

‘What upset me was the fact that when I recoiled he called me a “***less wonder” and everybody howled with laughter.’

Miss Ward said she had told police interviewing her about Savile that she did not want to make a complaint against Starr.

She added: ‘At no point have I said he’s a paedophile or accused him of any sexual offences.’
