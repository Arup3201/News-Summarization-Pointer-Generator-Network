A cash-strapped council has been slammed for spending an eye-watering £361,800 on iPads for councillors - claiming that the purchases 'saves money on printing costs'.

Shropshire Council announced last week they will be axing up to 1,700 jobs as they look to cut £80 million from their budget.

But town hall chiefs caused outrage after figures revealed they had splashed out the staggering amount of taxpayers cash on iPad tablets over the past four years.

Council chiefs said iPad usage improved 'productivity' and saved money on printing and administration

Shockingly, the average price for each of the 650 devices given to councillors and officers works out at £557 per iPad.

The average retail price of the swanky electronic devices is between £330 - £390.

Yesterday the authority defended the decision by claiming the move had saved £20,000 each year on their stationary and printing budget.

But local residents and campaigners were quick to point out the bill still leaves a deficit of £281,000.

The Taxpayers Alliance said local residents living in the county would be 'dismayed' by the figures.

Campaign manager Eleanor McGrath said: 'In order to have the moral authority to oversee necessary cuts in expenditure, councillors and council staff must ensure that any spending on themselves is necessary and delivering taxpayer value for money.

Councillor Kevin Pardy said iPads are a necessity and a must for he needs instant information

'It is certainly open to debate as to whether they needed the taxpayer to provide them with brand new tablet computers, but what's for sure is that people will be astounded to discover that they have been issuing themselves with iPads.

'These are expensive, top-of-the-range, premium products and if they need a council-issue tablet at all, they should be looking at the cheaper alternatives which are available.

'Shropshire residents will certainly be dismayed at how the savings in printing costs are belittled by the vast bill for the iPads.'

Local resident Geoff Mills, 42, who lives in Telford, Shropshire, added: 'They are cutting jobs left, right and centre and then spending thousands on sleek swanky devices for councillors.

'If its saving £20,000 each year but they are spending £360,000 on them - it seems like stupid maths to me.

'By the time they've paid for themselves almost 14 years down the line, they will probably be obsolete and they will spend it all again on the latest devices.

'They are luxury items and not a necessity.

'This funding should go to something much more worthwhile.'

Disability campaigner Nicky Clark, who launched the Shropshire cares campaign in 2010, said: 'They can do exactly the same functions on their existing Smartphone's and Blackberries as they can do on iPads.

'These people are gadget crazy bureaucrats who are deciding how the rest of us should live our lives.

'They're plundering services which are a lifeline to people and yet spend money on things like this.'

The Freedom of Information request shows the authority spent the cash on the tablet computers between April 2009 and May 2013.

It revealed that 63 out of the 75 elected councillors in Shropshire now use iPads, with the rest being used by officers

Figures show 49 people have been given iPads on top of electronic devices such as laptops, mobile phones and Blackberries.

And the monthly cost to Shropshire Council for iPad 3G data is £4,062.50, meaning the bill is £48,750 annually.

Council chiefs said iPad usage improved 'productivity' and saved money on printing and administration.

Newly-elected councillor Kevin Pardy, who represents the Sundorne ward, said the iPads were 'a must'.

He said: 'Before I became a councillor, I thought the iPad was a luxury but I now realise it is a necessity and at a time when I and my constituents need instant information it is a must.'

Shropshire Council said the iPads helped keep councillors connected with their electorate and increased productivity levels.

A spokesman said: 'Mobile computer tablets have been made available to staff and councillors to improve productivity and save money on printing and administrative costs.

'Anyone who wants to use a tablet has to have a sound business case for doing so, explaining how it would help them to do their job and save the council time and money.

'Since councillors have been using iPads, very few committee reports are now printed before meetings, which as well as improving the efficiency of the department has already produced ongoing savings.

'For example, the committee services stationery and printing budget for 2012/13 was reduced by more than £20,000, and a significant sum of this was solely down to councillors using iPads to access reports.

'There is also scope for further additional savings in future years.

'All councillors now have the option of using an iPad, and find they are helping them connect with their electorate better than they have been able to before.'
