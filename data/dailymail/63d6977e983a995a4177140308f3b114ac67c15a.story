LeBron James showed no lasting effects from cramping up in game one as his flawless second-half performances drew the Miami Heat level with San Antonio in the NBA Finals.

After just two points in the first quarter, James was unstoppable after the interval and he finished with 35 points in a narrow 98-96 victory.

It was a close game between the two heavyweights that was nip and tuck all the way, but Chris Bosh’s three-pointer with 1:18 remaining put the reigning NBA Champions ahead.

‘Got to play hard,’ he said. ‘I believe the man above will protect me. I just try to put myself and my teammates in position to succeed.’

Tony Parker led the scoring for San Antonio with 21 points while Tim Duncan scored 18 and added 15 rebounds, but it was in a losing effort for the Western Conference champions.

Manu Ginobili, who scored 19 points from the bench, said: ‘The bottom line is that it was a close game in the last two minutes and they executed better. Against a team like them, we're not going to score if we stop moving the ball.’

Miami have now won their last 13 games straight after a loss in the play-offs, and have never trailed 2-0 in a series in the LeBron era.

With games three and four at their home in Florida, San Antonio need to pull off a road victory to prevent the Heat winning their third straight title.
