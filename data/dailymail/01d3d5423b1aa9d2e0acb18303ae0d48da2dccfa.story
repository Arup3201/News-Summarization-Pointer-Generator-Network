A British couple has been taking part in an extraordinary romantic adventure over the last two years, travelling the world and experiencing a traditional wedding in every country they visit. 

Alex Pelling and Lisa Gant, from Manchester, left their life in the UK in 2011 to start afresh in Australia, identifying the very best places in the world to get married along the way.

In the two years they have been on the road so far they have participated in more than three dozen wedding ceremonies in over 50 countries.

The couple after their traditional Guatemalan wedding which took place on the terrace of a hotel with stunning views of the three volcanoes. The Xaman lit a fire of cigars, rose petals and candles and made offerings to the Gods and held the ceremony in Mayan

The beautiful Villa de Leyva was the location for this traditional Colombian farmer style wedding. Lisa arrived at on a donkey and they had a sheep as a guest 'as it is tradition'

Their blog has had more than a million views, and their Facebook page has more than 37,000 followers, as they experience the wonderful variety of cultures and traditions around the world. 

The couple had been friends for eight years when they began dating in 2008.

In 2011, after four years living together, Alex and Lisa made the brave decision to uproot their lives and follow their dream to relocate in Australia.

The couple rented out their house and sold Alex’s motor repair business as well as their possessions to get funding for their trip.

A million-dollar yacht, a canoe chapel and, you guessed it... a wedding! Lisa and Alex's Bora Bora nuptials

This wedding was held at Mitad del Mundo (the middle of the world) in Ecuador, where artist Cristobal Ortega held the ceremony. The highlight, say the couple, was being blessed with smoke by the entire congregation

A Texan ranch wedding held in a stunning location Las Brisas Farm. The entire wedding was made completely from reclaimed materials and covered in fairy lights. The couple clambered on hay bales and Alex even lassoed his bride!

A truly traditional Tahitian tying of the knot! The wedding took place in a Tiki village on the island of Moorea

The wedding in Utila, Honduras, took place at a magical wonderland all created by one man. Glass marbles, coloured stones and pottery, even cutlery adorns every surface making the place sparkle in the amazing sunlight

A wedding in Portugal which included a tour of Lisbon by tram, motorbike and sidecar. The wedding was held on the highest point in Lisbon overlooking the stunning city

While dismantling their lives in the UK, the couple decided to travel the world on their way to Australia and look for a place to get married.

The idea slowly transformed into finding the best place in the world to wed, by trying each one out, embracing the local marriage cultures and traditions as much as possible in every location.

Their aim was to find the most exceptional and unique wedding locations possible, blogging about their experiences so others could better chose where to tie the knot themselves.

Introducing themselves on their blog the couple say: 'We are Lisa and Alex, a couple in love, who, on failing to find the answer to the all important question; ‘Where can we get married’, decided to have a wedding ceremony in every country we visit in search of the perfect place to tie the knot!

‘On an adventure of a lifetime, we are going to drive (and ship) around the globe in our 27-year-old camper van Peggy exchanging vows in the most unusual and unique wedding locations we can find.

After the wedding Seattle, which took place in the Pike Place Market. Alex and Lisa are the second couple to marry at the market

At the Chappelle St Agnes Vineyard in Quebec. 'We stumbled upon the amazing European-inspired vineyard, complete with chapel and heart shaped lake, while on a wine tour'

‘Not wanting to drag a ‘White wedding’ around the World, we decided to try our hardest to embrace the culture and local traditions of each place we visit.

‘We want to experience the difference in every ceremony and find out what it is that makes the bringing of two people together, such a worldwide tradition, and of course let YOU know!’

Now on wedding 54, the couple have documented their nuptials, which have ranged from an ancient Pagan ritual in Lithuania to a ceremony aboard a multi-million dollar yacht and a drive-through wedding in Vegas.

The pair even had a topless Embera tribe wedding in Embera, Panama where they were painted with traditional tribal tattoo designs and beads.

Their experiences have been supported by local experts including shamans, Zulu chiefs, pastors, vicars, rabbis and even a Voodoo priestess, not to mention an army of wedding photographers and dedicated wedding professionals who have donated their time and skills to Alex and Lisa’s quest.

Lisa chose a stunning cream Charlotte Balbier gown, which she worn at 14 of her subsequent weddings (including one underwater!), and carried a bouquet of peonies, sweet Williams, lavender, mint and vintage English rosebuds for her dream ceremony.

‘I felt like a very spoilt princess!’ Lisa says on her blog.
