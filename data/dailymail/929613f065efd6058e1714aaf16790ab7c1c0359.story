Crews battled to contain a massive New Mexico wildfire on Friday that has torched a dozen homes, the largest of several blazes that have consumed more than 200 square miles (520 square km) of rugged land in half-a-dozen U.S. states in recent days.

Wildfires in sparsely-populated stretches of Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico and California have forced the evacuation of several small towns and torched miles of forest, brush and grass since mid-month.

The fires have taken hold in tinder-dry late-spring conditions in mostly remote tracts of the United States, and have been fanned by gusting winds of up to 50 mph.

Smoke rises into the air from a large forest fire which has consumed a total of 82,252 acres as seen in this U.S. Forest Service handout photo taken in Gila National Forest, New Mexico

The fire in New Mexico burned early Saturday through remote and rugged terrain around the Gila Wilderness and has grown to 85,000 acres (34,400 hectares) or more than 130 square miles (338 square kilometers).

The heavy smoke apparently disoriented six hikers Friday, prompting the New Mexico National Guard to carry out a rescue.

Col. Michael Montoya said one of the hikers had an injured knee and had to be taken to safety by ambulance. The others were able to walk to a secure area.

More than 500 firefighters are battling the blaze that resulted from the merger earlier this week of two lightning-sparked fires.

Fire officials say nearly all of the growth has come in recent days due to relentless winds.

The blaze has destroyed 12 cabins and seven small outbuildings, and the privately owned ghost town of Mogollon was placed under a voluntary evacuation order.

The strong winds pushed ash from the blaze 35 to 40 miles (56 to 64 kilometers) away, while smoke from the giant fire spread across the state and into Arizona.Â

The haze blocked views of the Sandia Mountains in Albuquerque, and a smell of smoke permeated the air throughout northern New Mexico.

And in Arizona, nearly 1,000 firefighters using aircraft and hand tools made strides toward containing the Grand Canyon state's largest and most dangerous blaze, the so-called Gladiator Fire.

That fire, which has torched more than 25 square miles (65 square km) of ponderosa pine and brush about 40 miles north of Phoenix, reached 35-percent containment on Friday.

The progress allowed the local sheriff's office to start letting some residents return to three small communities for the first time in 13 days.

Across the country in Michigan, two wildfires sparked by lightning strikes burned in forests and marshes of the sparsely populated Northern Peninsula, which is stuck in an extended dry spell, authorities said.

The larger of the two, the Duck Lake Fire has burned about 21,000 acres to the Lake Superior coastline.

The blaze has consumed dozens of structures, including vacation homes, and forced some evacuations of campers, but caused no injuries, said Ed Golder of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

There was no containment, as gusty winds had shifted to westerly breezes, threatening the Pike Lake area where there is a resort.

Health officials as far away as Albuquerque and Santa Fe issued alerts for the Memorial Day holiday weekend, advising people to limit outdoor activities and keep windows closed.

They said the effects on most people would be minor, but noted that mild throat and eye irritation or allergy-like symptoms could be expected.

Officials warned people with heart and lung conditions to be especially diligent in minimising their exposure to the smoky air.

In Southern California, firefighters worked to corral a wildfire that has chewed through 3,100 acres (1,255 hectares) of tinder-dry grass and light brush since it broke out Thursday afternoon east of Julian.

The fire was 20 percent contained, said Nick Schuler, battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. No injuries or damage to structures were reported.

In Arizona, residents of the historic mining town of Crown King were allowed to return home after being evacuated because of a wildfire about 85 miles (137 kilometers) north of Phoenix.

The fire started May 13 and has burned more than 16,000 acres (6,475 hectares). It is 35 percent contained, fire officials said.
