After several recent Southern California earthquakes left them sensitive to shaking, people around the region thought they felt the ground move earlier this week. But this rumble came from the air.

U.S. Navy Cmdr. Kevin Stephens told the Los Angeles Times  on Thursday that the shaking was a sonic boom produced by an F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet.

The jet was over the Pacific Ocean about 35 miles southwest of San Diego when it broke the sound barrier.

Whats that noise? The rumble was created by an F/A-18 Hornet fighter plane. The jet was over the Pacific Ocean about 35 miles southwest of San Diego when it broke the sound barrier

Some residents in Long Beach and the north Orange County coast reported feeling and hearing what some thought was an earthquake.

But Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton said no earthquakes were reported in the area during the time the shaking was reported.

Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor to the LA Times that any sonic boom would come from a military aircraft.

'Civil aircraft do not exceed the speed of sound, so any sonic boom would come from a military aircraft,' he said.

Long distance: Although the military exercise was bring carried out 100 miles away, the sound traveling at 760mph soon reached the coastline

'Military aircraft do not fly supersonically in civilian airspace; they would only do so in restricted military airspace out over the ocean.'

Sonic booms move in the direction a jet is flying, and because it was pointed northward the rumble was felt in Orange and Los Angeles counties.

While some may equate sonic booms to sounding like sharp cracks, the farther away you are from the jet, the more likely you might hear a rumbling sound that can shake buildings.

NASA aerospace engineer Edward Haering compared it to lightning strikes. The closer you are to the lightning, the more likely you’ll hear a sharp crack. The farther away you are, the more likely you’ll hear a rumble.

The F/A-18 was flying as part of a demonstration of the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, whose home port is in Coronado.

It was a fighter jet: Although some have speculated it could be the testing of the mythical top-secret Aurora spy plane project

The plane flew faster than the speed of sound as part of an exercise  50 miles off the coast. The speed of sound is about 761 miles per hour.

It can be hard for pilots to know where and how far sonic booms will travel. A lot depends on the weather and the direction of the wind, which helps determine where the sound will go.

Some have speculated it could be the testing of the mythical top-secret Aurora spy plane project.

When the Navy conducted a similar flight further south in the summer of 2012, most of San Diego felt it

Many who felt the shaking took to social media, assuming it was an earthquake.

Scott Conner told the Times that he was convinced it was a quake and was the biggest he had ever experiences.

'I thought it was the biggest quake I’ve ever been in…. This thing was big, big,' he said. 'The whole house just lifted.'
