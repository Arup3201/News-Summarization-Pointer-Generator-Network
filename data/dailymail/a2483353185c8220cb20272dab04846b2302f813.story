David Cameron is set to strike a blow for ‘Britishness’ by putting the Union Jack on all new photocard driving licences from next year.

But the move has sparked fury among Scottish independence campaigners after ministers ruled against allowing licences north of the border to carry the Saltire instead.

That is despite the fact there are no plans to put the Union Jack on driving licences in Northern Ireland because of what officials referred to as the ‘particular sensitivities surrounding symbols’ in the Province.

The current driving licence has the European Union's 12 gold stars with the word 'UK' inside, but David Cameron will put the Union Jack there instead, infuriating Scottish independence campaigners

Mr Cameron announced two years ago that he wanted to see the UK flag on British photocard licences. They currently show the European Union’s 12 gold stars with the word ‘UK’ inside.

A final go-ahead was postponed until after the referendum on Scottish independence.

Government sources said last night that licences would carry the flags of both the EU and the UK from next Spring. 

But they will not allow Scottish licences to use the flag of Scotland, or Welsh licences to carry the Red Dragon flag ‘on cost grounds’.

Angus Robertson, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said: ‘If the UK Government is able to make different arrangements for other parts of the UK, I don’t see why that shouldn’t also be the case for Scotland.’

The Union Jack will be placed in the top left corner of the driving licence, but the Saltire will not be permitted
