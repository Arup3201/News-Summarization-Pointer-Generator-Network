Support for shops: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles wants to help shoppers and motorists by relaxing parking charges

Drivers could be granted a ‘grace period’ to park outside the shops for a few minutes without paying, under plans being considered by Eric Pickles.

The Local Government secretary said he wanted to end the ‘war on the motorist’ which is putting people off shopping in their town centres.

He said parking charges had become ‘ridiculously high’ and drivers were being used as ‘cash cows’ by local councils.

Mr Pickles said: ‘We are looking at more ways to curb ridiculously high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens who pounce on those simply popping into their local shop for a pint of milk or to buy a paper.

‘This overly aggressive stance towards the motorist is not good for the high street. Councils should be supporting their local high streets and wider economy, not using drivers as cash cows.’ 

Sources in his department said the plans under consideration include limits on how much councils can levy, and ‘grace periods’ on parking spaces for quick trips to town centres.

A few councils already allow drivers to park free for up to 30 minutes near their local shops, but it is understood similar schemes will be implemented more widely.

Mr Pickles warned two years ago that town centres had become ‘ghost towns’ as people were put off shopping there by aggressive parking rules and instead turning to out-of-town supermarkets.

His comments chime with the Mary Portas review, an independent report commissioned by the Government into the future of the high street, which stressed that cheap or free parking was key to the local economy.

The Department for Communities and Local Government can only issue guidelines to councils, but Mr Pickles said: ‘We are offering guidance about being reasonable. By and large councils obey guidance.’

Opportunistic: The Local Government secretary said he wanted to end the ¿war on the motorist¿ which is putting people off shopping in town

Whitehall planning rules brought in by Labour in 2001 restricted the number of parking spaces in new developments which triggered an increase in parking restrictions.

Councils were discouraged from setting lower parking charges to attract more shoppers into town centres. But the Government say this unfairly penalised drivers and instead drove them away.

Between 2000 and 2007, average parking charges jumped 40 per cent from 86p for two hours to £1.21. Research has shown that a relatively small increase in the parking charges can result in dramatic fall-offs in visitors to shops.

An AA spokesperson said: ‘It is well documented that when you have high parking charges somewhere people don’t go there, and that has an impact on business and trade.

‘Some town centres will give you 30 minutes free, so you can go into the bank or drop off a prescription and we think other authorities should see the merit of that.

‘If it is well controlled, there will be quick turnover of spaces. People say it creates traffic, but you have balance that with the impact on the local economy to get people in to the shops.

‘They could also follow the example of some other European and build large underground car parks where appropriate. You cannot punish people with pricing.

Parking problems: Mr Pickles criticised high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens

‘Fuel prices are already having a big impact on people using their cars, so any extra charges drive people into out of town shops where parking is free.’

But Peter Box of the Local Government Association said the Government’s own figures show parking charges rose by just 1.25 per cent - less than inflation - over the past two years.

He said: ‘Claims councils are hiking up parking charges to make money off motorists are not borne out by the facts.

‘Regulating parking is essential to keep traffic flowing, pedestrians and motorists safe, roads clear for emergency services and business deliveries, and ensuring people can park near their homes or local shops.

‘What works in one town or city might not in another, depending on factors such as population, weight of traffic, road layout, number of car parks and who runs them. It is for councils, in consultation with residents and businesses, to decide what works best for their communities.’
