Sandhole farm in Congleton, Cheshire has welcomed an unlikely guest, a long-haired creature from almost 5,000 miles away called the Himalayan yak.

The mammoth-like beast, which is normally found in the chilly climates of Tibet, Russia and Mongolia, weighs half a tonne. The width between the tip of the left horn and the tip of the right horn is 4ft.

Unlike traditional cows, the yak does not make a 'mooing' sound and instead makes a grunting noise similar to that of a pig.

A year and a half ago, Helen and Matthew Worth became the first people to breed the yak in the UK.

Holy yak: This fierce looking bovid weighs half a tonne. The breed originates from been the Himalayas and the animals normally live in freezing temperatures on the Tibetan plateau

The yak, pictured here with one of its calves, can survive in temperatures as low as - 40 degrees. The animals have wide horns and are nimble on their feet

Helen and Matt Worth own a 200 acre farm in Congleton, Cheshire. Vet Mrs Worth completed a diploma in Bovine reproduction at The University of Liverpool after her first veterinary degree

After researching yaks for 18 months, the couple imported the bull and three female yaks from Germany and Holland.

They have already produced two pure-bred calves, by impregnating traditional holstein cows and hope to produce another bull.

Their yaks are covered in a mass of 
thick, wiry hair to keep them warm in their native climates and have 
enormous horns to help shovel thick snow. Wild yaks - Bos grunniens in Latin - can grow up to seven feet tall and weigh up to a tonne.

And a yak could soon be coming to a village near you because the couple has since sold the bull's semen to some six farmers.

In a few months when their new herd is ready, Mr and Mrs Worth will be visiting local gastropubs and farmers market to promote the meat- said to be incredibly lean and low in cholesterol and saturated fat.

Yak has long been eaten in countries such as India and Tibet. Yak milk and butter is also used as an alternative to traditional milk and butter.

The hair is used to make blankets and 
clothes and is even used in the UK for wigs worn in theatrical 
performances.

The meat is already popular in America, with yak burgers, yak stew and yak roast on restaurant menus.

Health benefits of yak can be compared to chicken but the taste is similar to traditional beef.

The yaks eat the same food as traditional cows and have similar temperaments. But their fur is much longer and they have horns measuring 4ft from the extremity of the left horn to the end of the right

Yaks also produce healthier milk than traditional cows - and at a faster pace.

A yak fetus develops at a quicker speed than a tradition cow, bringing the gestation period down from nine months to eight.

This means the process of impregnating the cow again is greatly sped up, meaning they can produce more milk.

Mrs Worth, a 38-year-old vet, said: 'Many farmers I work with own dairy farms and they practise block calving, where they get all their cows pregnant at the same time.

Mr and Mrs Worth have imported the first yak into the UK. The hope that the trend will catch on

Yows: The half yaks are new additions to the herd at Sandhole Farm in Congleton, Cheshire

'This is normally done in the spring time
 because there is a lot of green grass available for them to feed on, so
 it is economical for farmers and nutritional for the cows.

'Cows have a gestational period of nine months and it would be ideal for a cow to have a calf once a year but that gives them just three months to recover.

'I heard that other countries were breeding their cows with yaks because yak bulls have a gestational period of just eight months.

Yak meat is currently not in common usage in the UK but it is already popular in America.

Countries such as India and Tibet use the animal's milk to create an alternative cheese and butter.

But pure-bred yaks can only produce enough milk for their calves so the yak needs to be crossed with a traditional cow.

Although the taste of the meat is similar to beef, its health benefits are equivalent to chicken.

Recipes containing yak meat can include: Shepherd's pie, Yak stew and Yak chilli.

Although the meat is healthier than regular meat yak milk is higher in fat than traditional milk

'It gives the cows longer to recover and more of an opportunity for them to become pregnant again.'

The vet said her fascination with the animals began when she did some research and discovered that yaks had been bred for thousands of years in the Himalayas.

She said: 'Families would have originally had a yak as their house cow to be used for things like milk and butter.

'Pure-bred yaks only produce enough milk for their calves however, so they started crossing them with cows. This resulted in a hybrid that produced enough for the family.

'Not only does breeding cows with yaks make the gestational period shorter but the meat itself is very lean and low in cholesterol.'

The female yak is smaller than its male counterpart but has all of the same features - including its horns

Rural Cheshire is almost five thousand miles from Tibet - the traditional home of the yak. Yaks are found in the Himalayas  and as far as Mongolia and Russia. Despite their fierce appearance, the majority of yaks are domesticated animals
