Crusade: Greg Wallace rooted out the lavish spending after he was suspended as a head teacher

A superhead once hailed as one of Michael Gove's 'Magnificent Seven' exposed how his own bosses blew almost £60,000 on jaunts to luxury hotels, the U.S. and Canada.

Greg Wallace launched the crusade after he was suspended as the executive head of five schools in Hackney, north east London, amid an investigation into alleged financial irregularities.

He discovered board members at The Learning Trust stayed for two days at the Royal Automobile Club complex at the 17th Century stately home Woodcote Park in Surrey - just 20 miles away.

An offshoot of the London private members' club which opened in 1897 and was endorsed by Edward VII, it has a banqueting room, a billiards room, two restaurants, two bars and a golf course.

Other overnight trips were to the 17th Century red brick Wotton House in Surrey, whose Italian-style garden was the first in England, and the nearby four-star Selsdon Park, which is set in 250 acres of countryside and has one of the south east's premier golf courses.

The annual meetings - all within 60 miles of Hackney - cost the Trust £38,266 over seven years.

Headteachers were also sent on two foreign 'study trips' lasting nine days each to Ontario, Canada, and Tucson, Arizona - which cost the Trust £21,525 and Hackney schools another £21,525.

The eye-watering £59,790 total has led to questions why the Trust did not hold the annual meetings in its own school buildings.

At the time The Learning Trust - since re-named the Hackney Learning Trust - was a private company but received large sums of public money to do its work.

It has since been re-absorbed into Hackney Council.

Lavish: A stay at the 17th Century Selsdon Park hotel in Surrey - 17 miles from Hackney - cost £7,100

Costly: Another stay at the nearby Wotton House Hotel cost almost £5,500. At the time The Learning Trust in Hackney was a private firm but received substantial amounts of public money to do its work

Stately home: Many of the trips were to Woodcote Park, which is now owned by the Royal Automobile Club

The annual away days were taken from 
2004 to 2010. Only in 2011 and 2012, due to financial constraints, 
did the board choose one-day seminars at the UBS bank instead.

Learning Trust board chairman Richard Hardie is also the chairman of UBS's London Advisory Board.

Jonathan
 Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'It’s 
astounding that the Trust thought it reasonable to waste taxpayers’ 
money on these expensive away days and foreign jaunts.

'Rather than swanning off on these expensive trips the trust should have focused on its job in Hackney.

'There’s no reason why these away days couldn’t have taken place on council property.'

A
 Hackney Council spokesman said: 'These training days were part of the 
professional development of The Learning Trust's board members and took 
place while it was a private limited company. They cost an average of 
£263.90 for each person per year.

'Since
 Hackney Learning Trust rejoined Hackney Council in 2012, training days 
have been held in house or with partner organisations, at a much lower 
cost.'

The U.S. and Canada trips were each taken by 16 headteachers.

Three members of Learning Trust staff accompanied them each time, but were paid for by consultancy Leannta
 Education Associates, which organised the trips, and not public funds.

Mr
 Wallace was suspended in July last year after Hackney Council launched 
an investigation into financial irregularities under his leadership, which related to the awarding of computer contracts.

He submitted the Freedom of Information requests about spending in September.

He
tendered his resignation effective at the end of the year, but by the time that came he had already been sacked.

Hackney Council completed its report into the alleged conduct but it has not been made public. The council cited legal reasons.

A Hackney Council spokesman said: 'A 
routine audit at a Best Start Federation school uncovered concerns about
 financial irregularity and the procurement of ICT contracts.

'A
 full independent investigation was carried out and although Mr Wallace 
tendered his resignation during the disciplinary process, the procedure 
was completed and we can confirm Mr Wallace was subsequently dismissed 
from his position.

Luxurious: The Selsdon Park Hotel in Surrey was at one time the seat of the Bishops of Rochester

History: Wotton House was a seat of aristocracy and the birthplace in 1620 of diarist and gardener John Evelyn

'The report also made a number of 
recommendations to tighten financial and procurement procedures in BSF 
schools.

'The Federation's governing body has agreed to defederate the 
schools and new governing bodies will be set up for each school. Those 
new bodies will take forward the recommendations.'

Mr Wallace launched his career in education as headteacher of Woodberry Down primary school, north London, in 2001.

He
 was deemed so successful he was drafted in to turn around four more 
underperforming schools - London Fields in Hackney, Whitmore in Hoxton, 
Mandeville in Lower Clapton, and Burbage in Hoxton.

They all came under the umbrella of the Best Start Federation.

Education
 Secretary Michael Gove lavished praise on Mr Wallace in a speech to the
 Association of School and College Leaders in 2012.

Singling
 him out alongside six other superheads, he said: '[His] students are 
drawn from the poorest parts of Hackney and have benefitted hugely from a
 rigorous approach to reading in the early years which makes them 
enthusiastic devourers of every book they can get their hands on.

'The
 reason I mention these - and I could mention many more - is that I 
don’t think any leader in education should give a speech or appear in 
public to talk about education without celebrating success and giving a 
shout-out to those who’ve achieved it.

'But
 there’s a special reason I mention these magnificent seven today. And 
it goes to the heart of the moral purpose of this Government. I’ve said 
in the past - will say again - and the evidence backs me up when I say 
it.

'We have the best generation of young teachers ever in our schools. We have the best generation of heads ever in our schools.'
