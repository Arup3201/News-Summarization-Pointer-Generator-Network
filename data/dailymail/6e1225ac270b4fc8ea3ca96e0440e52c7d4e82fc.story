The young wife of a star football player has died suddenly after suffering a suspected brain aneurysm or stroke.

Ashley Harris, 29, died on Sunday evening. She was the wife of San Diego Chargers defensive tackle Tommie Harris and had two young children, Tyson, aged three, and four month-old Tinsley.

The couple had married on New Year's Day this year and were planning to hold a wedding reception in Oklahoma.

Ashley Harris was taken to hospital on 
Friday afternoon in Norman, Oklahoma while the couple were in town for a
visit, according to the Daily Herald.

Tommie Harris played college football for the University of Oklahoma. He had a four-year, $40 million contract with the Bears but was released at the end of the 2010 season and moved to the San Diego Chargers last September.

An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the vessel wall. As blood passes through the weakened vessel, the blood pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon.

Aneurysms within the body or brain often have no symptoms.

If an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur.

The risk of death after a rupture is high.

An official cause of death for Mrs Harris has not yet been confirmed but an autopsy was pending.

Family friend Bill Horn told the Chicago
Tribune: 'He's obviously in disbelief.

'But he's got such a strong 
support group, teammates and everybody around him.'

A San Diego Chargers spokesman said: 'The Chargers family is saddened by the sudden loss of one of our very 
young members.

'Tommie Harrisâ€™ wife 
Ashley was just 29 and leaves behind a loving husband and two young 
children. Our prayers are with the Harris family during this most 
difficult time.'

Mrs Harris funeral will be held on Friday in New Orleans where she grew up.
