The group launched its career in 1963 with a popular rendition of Richard Berry's 'Louie, Louie' before releasing its own hits like 'Kicks,' 'Hungry' and 'Good Thing'

Described as a teenage businessman with a recognizable name by the Los Angeles Times, he was known for wearing Revolutionary War-era costumes in live shows.

The group launched its career in 1963 with a popular rendition of Richard Berry's 'Louie, Louie' before releasing its own hits like 'Kicks,' 'Hungry' and 'Good Thing.'

The band's biggest hit arrived in 1971 with 'Indian Reservation.'

A 1965 song, 'Just Like Me,'  was put on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.

Revere and the Raiders served as the house band for the Dick Clark TV show 'Where the Action Is.'

'From day one, we've always been a party band that accidentally had some hit records and accidentally got on a hit television series,' Revere told the Associated Press in 2000.

While he kept up a frantic tour schedule in recent years, health issues forced him back home about six months ago

'We were visual and fun and crazy and were America's answer to the British music invasion,' he added. 'We just happened to be at the right time and had the right name and had the right gimmick.' 

 The Raiders would also appear on Clark's show, 'Happening' as well as making guest appearances on 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' 'The Tonight Show,' and on the 'Batman' television show starring Adam West in 1966.

'After you've had some success, you're afraid it's gonna go away and you need to take advantage of it, so you work as hard as you can, because it might disappear tomorrow,' he said. 

Revere remained a constant presence with the group for almost five decades.

While he kept up a frantic tour schedule in recent years, health issues forced him back home about six months ago.

Survivors include his wife of 35 years, Sydney.
