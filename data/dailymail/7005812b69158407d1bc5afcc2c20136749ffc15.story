Chelsea’s huge investment in Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas could turn out to be sound business based on an evening when both of them shone as Jose Mourinho resisted the idea of giving Didier Drogba a second debut.

The Ivorian looked on as Costa effectively made all three of the goals, with the promising pre-season form of Mourinho’s team continuing against a team they have almost colonised with loan signings these past four years.

While only a friendly it was hard not to be drawn to the all-round quality of the £32 million signing from Atletico Madrid in his eighty minutes on the pitch, despite clashing with Vitesse skipper Guram Kashia after being on the receiving end of a heavy tackle.

Boss Mourinho praised his contribution afterwards.

'He's very intelligent the way he presses and he's a team man,' said the Chelsea chief.

'He had two big chances to score but he prefers not to risk, but played for the team. We can feel he's happy to be with us and we're very happy with it.'

Costa immediately impressed when latching 
on to a delightful through ball from Nemanja Matic and then unselfishly 
put Mohamed Salah through when he could have scored himself.

The Spaniard was involved again when he surged at the Vitesse defence and was brought down just outside the area, resulting in a shoving match with opposing captain Guram Kahshia.

From there £27 million Fabregas stepped up to skilfully curl the ball past the despairing Eloy Room.

Costa 
finished his evening’s work by darting through the defence before again 
squaring the ball to give Matic the simplest of chances to convert.

With a better first touch Salah could 
have had a hat-rick by half-time, while Petr Cech was also kept busy at 
times, notably when saving at the feet of the eyecatching Kelvin 
Leerdom.

If Costa was constantly involved then it was 
another torrid evening for Fernando Torres, who veered from the 
anonymous to the disinterested. Substitute Uros Djurdevic scrambled a 
late consolation for Vitesse.
