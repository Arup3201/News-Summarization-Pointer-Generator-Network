The English teacher of a gay student 
who was shot by a classmate at a junior high school testified 
that she told him to stop wearing eyeliner and mascara and when he 
refused the classroom disruption escalated.

Jill Ekman told jurors that 15-year-old 
Larry King wore even more makeup after she told him to stop drawing 
attention to himself, the Ventura County Star reported.

She said Larry told her the school's 
assistant vice-principal, Joy Epstein, said he could and was told by her that the 15-year-old had constitutional rights to do so.

Later, an email message was issued telling teachers that Larry's 
attire was allowed and that they should try to teach students tolerance.

Ms Ekman said she incorporated the message 
of tolerance into her lessons, but that the problem continued.

She said 
boys complained to her that Larry was chasing them into the bathroom.

'I explained to him that what he was 
doing was inappropriate and he laughed and said that he could go into 
the boys' bathroom and he liked to see them squirm,' she said.

Ms Ekman said she went to Ms Epstein to 
complain about the teen's behaviour again, but the administrator told her 
there was nothing that could be done.

Four days later, he was shot in 
the head in the computer classroom at E.O Green School in Oxnard.

Her testimony came after the 
half-brother of Brandon McInerney, who's on trial for the 2008 shooting 
death, told the jury that the defendant was sexually abused.

James Bing 
testified that the abuse at the hands of a cousin, coupled with physical abuse
by their father, scarred McInerney, now 17.

McInerney, who was 14 at the time of the shooting, is being tried as an adult on first-degree murder and hate crime charges.

The trial was moved to Los Angeles County because of extensive media coverage in Ventura County.

Assistant vice-principal Joy Epstein previously told jurors
that the 15-year-old had made sexually inappropriate comments to 
other students in the weeks before the shooting.

She said she warned Larry that dressing 
differently could make things hard on him.

But she added that she and other teachers didn't discourage him because it didn't violate the school's dress code.

Ms Epstein's sexuality was also brought up during the trial this week and it was the first time jurors heard that she was openly lesbian.

Susan Crowley, King's seventh-grade special education teacher, said she did not think Joy Epstein was being truthful when she testified that King's behaviour 
was being adequately addressed by school administrators and that very 
few people had complained about King's clothing.

'It is impossible for any sentient being not to know,' she said. 'Every conversation I had with an adult leading up to his death was 
about Larry's behaviour.'

She said that Larry was a sweet, caring kid who endeared himself to certain teachers at E.O. Green School but had trouble making that same connection with students his own age, according to court testimony on Monday.

She said: 'He desperately wanted to be liked but didn't have the social skills to get along with his peers. He often said things that were one note off the mark.'

'I was concerned they were designed to draw negative attention to himself and would make him unhappy and victimized.

'He couldn't distinguish between positive and negative attention. He just wanted people to pay attention to him.'

According to VC Star, she told the 
court that Larry was extremely immature for his age and didn't have a 
firm grasp of his sexuality.

A year before, he was wearing women's
high-heeled boots and telling friends he was gay, and complained that 
another boy was sexually harassing him at school.

She said: 'I think Larry was probably gay, but I don't think he knew that. He had a lot of years before he could figure it out.'

Senior Deputy District Attorney Maeve Fox asked Ms Crowley if she thought Ms Epstein empowered Larry. She said yes.

Another teacher, Shirley Brown, also 
testified that she didn't think Ms Epstein was adequately addressing the
issue of King's behaviour and its impact on students.

She said when Larry came to school with thick pancake and eye makeup, she told him to take it off.

'He looked like a clown, and if a 
girl came into my class like that, I would tell her to go to the 
bathroom and wash it off,' Ms Brown testified. 'I would talk to any 
student who was doing anything that was making themselves a target.'

McInerny's lawyers are arguing that he was pushed over the edge by Larry's unwelcome advances.

Prosecutors say McInerney was motivated by white supremacy to commit a hate crime.

Exactly how teachers should deal with Larry King's appearance was a concern among school administrators back in 2008.

They decided it was within his constitutional rights to wear such garb and it wasn't outside the school's dress code.

'I did tell him that junior high is the most difficult time for most students, and by dressing the way he did, it could be difficult for him, but it was his choice,' Mrs Epstein said.

'I told him, "More power to you if you can get through it".'

Larry's death has roiled gay-rights advocates and parents in Oxnard, a city about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, and has resonated with the nation

Prosecutors are trying to prove McInerney disliked gays and committed premeditated murder.

The
defence says McInerney came from a violent and troubled home, was 
pushed to the edge after King made too many unwelcome advances and is 
only guilty of manslaughter.

The
opposing lawyers argued over whether incidents involving King were 
serious disruptions at school that went unpunished, or just typical 
actions of an awkward eighth-grader, vcstar.com reports

Mrs
Epstein said she never had anyone complain to her about King's clothing
— other than his own younger brother, who said he was being teased 
because of it.

King did say
sexually inappropriate things to other students and pushed another 
student against a wall in the weeks before his death, Mrs Epstein 
testified.

She added that after a second incident, a disciplinary form was put into his permanent record.

McInerney's
lawyer, Scott Wippert, asked Mrs Epstein why, when the school's student
handbook explicitly said violence or sexual harassment would be met 
with suspension, King never received more serious discipline.

Ms Epstein said he was given appropriate discipline and it was dealt with in the correct manner.

When Senior Deputy District Attorney Maeve Fox asked if the name calling and shoving by King were anything beyond typical eighth-grade behavior, Epstein replied no.

Earlier Monday, Dawn Boldrin, the teacher who was in the classroom when King was shot, continued her testimony from Friday.

Miss Boldrin described McInerney as a nice kid who hadn't caused any problems.

She was, however, more forthright in her opinion about the school in the aftermath of the shooting.

'I was having a difficult time with depression and fear," she said of the months after the killing.

'I know for a fact that the school has done nothing to make the classroom safer for anyone.

'They have not done anything to prevent this from happening again.'

Boldrin, who had befriended King and gave him a green homecoming dress in the month before he was killed, said she no longer works at the school, and that she was forced to quit.

'I wouldn't want to go back to the school where they treat students and me like that,' said

She said she never asked anyone's permission to give King her daughter's used homecoming dress, because he had started wearing makeup and his guardians seemed OK with the change.

'It seemed like the foster care he was in was not condoning it per se but at least allowing him to finally do what he wanted to do instead of fighting him on it,' she said.

According to court documents,  as the boys sat in
a computer lab, McInerney drew a .22-caliber gun from his sweatshirt 
and shot Larry in the back of the head.

Prosecutor
Maeve Fox wrote in court documents McInerney 'then stood up as Larry 
collapsed to the floor, looked around at his astonished classmates and 
delivered a second coup-de-grace shot into the back of Larry's head.'
