A pop culture lover has found an innovative way to bring music albums to life.

Photographer Bob Egan superimposes the classic covers onto the exact London location where they were shot.

Using various clues from album covers, mixed with Google Streetview, Egan finds the street, and then brings the memorable album cover to life.

He has to be meticulous with his angles, but can do little to guarantee the exact lighting.

The Beatles' Abbey Road album cover from 1969 evokes memories of a time when the group really did rule the world - yet something as simple as crossing a road remains etched on the mind.

Oasis set their own trend in the 1990s, and their album cover for (What's The Story) Morning Glory? was also simple, yet effective and memorable.

Here we take a look at these and some other creations from the New York-based photographer, whose other work can be seen on his PopSpots website.

By working out the angles, Egan super-imposes The Beatles' Abbey Road album onto the present-day location. The cover was designed by Apple Records creative director Kosh. It is the only original UK Beatles album sleeve to show neither the artist name nor the album title on its front cover, which was Kosh's idea, despite EMI claiming the record would not sell without this information. He later explained that 'we didn't need to write the band's name on the cover - They were the most famous band in the world.'

Famous: The world-recognised album Abbey Road by The Beatles; Egan then finds the exact location which is just outside the world famous Abbey Road Studios, in Westminster, London

Iconic: Oasis broke new ground in the 1990s with their album (What's The Story) Morning Glory? and here it is brought to life on Berwick Street in London's Soho

Trend-setters: The Clash defined British punk and formed in 1976 with this self-titled album. The cover artwork was designed by Polish artist Roslaw Szaybo. The album’s front cover photo, shot by Kate Simon, was taken in the alleyway directly opposite the front door of the band’s ‘Rehearsal Rehearsals’ building in Camden Market. Drummer Terry Chimes, though a full member of The Clash at the time, did not appear in the picture as he had already decided to leave the group.

Captured: Egan managed to fade out the garish red sign on Heddon Street, London, so that K.West from the original Bowie cover for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars is prominent

Back in the day: The album cover photograph for 
The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars was taken 
outside furriers K. West at 23 Heddon Street, London, W1., looking 
south-east towards 
the centre of the city

Blast from the past: Pink Floyd's Animals album cover was designed by Roger Waters. At the time he lived near Clapham Common, and regularly drove past the Battersea Power Station, which was by then approaching the end of its useful life

Smoking: Battersea Power Station was the sole focus for Pink Floyd's Animals album cover; the somewhat 'tidied up' the area today has seen some major development around
