Foreign Secretary William Hague is to demand a group of EU countries be able to give Brussels a red card

Britain is to demand national governments have the power to give a red card to Brussels red-tape.

William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, revealed the idea of allowing a bloc of fewer than 10 EU states to veto unwelcome laws will be a key demand of renegotiation talks to claw back powers.

But he rejected calls from Tory MPs for the UK to be able to say no unilaterally to anything that the European Union demands, warning it would undermine the single market.

David Cameron was warned last night that he risked causing disastrous divisions in the Tory party after a letter from 95 backbenchers demanding the right to say No to European legislation was branded unrealistic.

The number of rebels calling for a veto on new EU laws – and the power to repeal existing ones that threaten Britain’s national interests – dwarfs the 81 MPs who voted against the Government on Europe in 2011.

The letter was signed by almost two thirds of the 158 backbenchers not given jobs by Mr Cameron.

Mr Hague today said the idea of every EU country being able to go it alone and reject any Brussels edict would be unworkable ‘in any system which relies on common rules’.

But he revealed Tory plans to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership before an in-out referendum would include allowing groups of member states to say no to Eurocrats.

Under existing EU rules, if a third of the 28 member states object to planned legislation they can raise a ‘yellow card’ demanding it be reviewed.

But Mr Hague wants to go further and allow a ‘red card’ system which would allow fewer than 10 countries to reject EU laws outright.

‘We do want a much bigger role for national parliaments,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘It’s common ground not only in the Conservative party but in the country that the powers of the European Union have increased too much, that they are too great, that they must be diminished.

‘It is common ground I think that national parliaments need a bigger role. One of the things I have advocated is a red card system where if enough national parliaments across the EU want to block something then they are able to do so.’

Prime Minister David Cameron has been warned that he will foster division in the party if he ignores the views of eurosceptics

He said the idea would ‘absolutely’ be part of British demands for a fresh settlement with the EU.

‘There’s a yellow card system, not very much used at the moment, but it needs to be much stronger red card system.

‘And many other ways can be looked at of strengthening the powers of national parliaments.’

But he dismissed the calls from dozens if Tory MPs for every national government to be able to refuse to implement EU law.

Mr Hague added: ‘What you can’t have in any system which relies on common rules  even in a free trade area that relies on common rules is each of the parliaments being able regularly and unilaterally to say we are not applying this or that just by own decision.

‘Clearly a single market or free trade area would not work on that basis; even the Swiss or Norwegian arrangement with the European Union could not work on that basis.

Bernard Jenkin, who co-ordinated the letter, said europhiles overestimate the economic damage that could be caused if the Uk renegotiates its relationship with the EU

‘We have to be careful what we support but the direction of greater power for national parliaments and reducing relatively speaking the powers of the European Union, vis-à-vis national parliaments is something I very strongly support.’

The row is expected to intensify on Wednesday when Chancellor George Osborne makes a speech arguing that Britain should remain within a reformed European Union.

The number of rebels calling for a veto on new EU laws – and the power to repeal existing ones that threaten Britain’s national interests – dwarfs the 81 MPs who voted against the Government on Europe in 2011.

The letter was signed by almost two thirds of the 158 backbenchers not given jobs by Mr Cameron.

The rebels say at least six Cabinet members also back them, plus six ministerial aides and members of Mr Cameron’s policy board, making the true figure 107 MPs or more.

One signatory said: ‘If Downing Street digs in over this they are absolutely bonkers. They will create a Cabinet split. This is a wake-up call. If the governing elite of our party are so absolutely out of touch it’s going to be absolutely disastrous.’

At the moment, Mr Cameron can only veto new laws on the most sensitive issues such as defence and the EU budget.

But while Parliament can raise concerns with the European Commission, it has no powers to block or repeal existing laws.

The rebels call on Mr Cameron to ‘make the idea of a national veto over current and future EU laws a reality’ and ‘enable Parliament to disapply EU legislation, where it is in our vital national interests to do so’.

The MPs point out that this ‘would transform the UK’s negotiating position in the EU’ as Mr Cameron seeks to carve out a new relationship with Brussels ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017.

Bernard Jenkin, who coordinated the letter, said: ‘We’re all being very polite to each other but I think it’s better if we have some honest disagreements on the future of Europe rather than pretending we agree.

‘It’s the facile tactics Europhiles always use. They start talking about three million jobs as if the sky is going to fall in if we ask for some powers back.’

Jacob Rees-Mogg, another signatory, said many rebels don’t even want the single market, adding: ‘If this makes the single market not work, that’s not the problem. We can still have free trade, which is more important. Laws should be made by our democratic representatives, not by the fiat of Brussels.’

Signatories include James Clappison, Conor Burns, John Baron, Anne Main and ex-defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth. One said: ‘Downing Street’s argument is such rubbish. We are at crunch point. They are heading for the most almighty smash-up.’

They said Mr Cameron had nothing to lose by making the veto Tory policy because the pro-European wing of the Tory Party was so depleted. One added: ‘Would the party be split? I don’t think so.’

Europe's ‘travelling circus’, in which MEPs decamp to France once a month, costs taxpayers at least £93million a year.

European Union figures show the astonishing price of packing up the parliament in Brussels and shipping it to Strasbourg for just four days each month.

Conservative MEPs estimated the true cost to be £130million – and called for an end to the practice.

Some £250,000 is spent just lugging paperwork between the two cities, a report on the ‘financial and environmental impact’ showed.

Maintaining the parliament in Strasbourg costs £50million a year.

Although MEPs voted to scrap the ‘circus’ by three to one last year, the French will veto any such attempt.

Conservative MEP Ashley Fox said: ‘This craziness has to stop.’
