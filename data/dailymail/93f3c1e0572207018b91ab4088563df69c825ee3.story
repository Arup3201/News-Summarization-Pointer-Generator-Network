A British tourist's outdoor romp in the Nevada desert ended in disaster after the excitement triggered a heart attack - landing him with a $250,000 medical bill.

Peter Cousins, 55, was travelling the world with his partner Dawn Reed when they stopped to work on a cowboy ranch in the middle of the desert.

The pair had been trekking and were miles from civilization when they came across the beautiful natural hot spring and decided to have an outdoor tryst.

But the romance was shattered when Mr Cousins suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed. Around 60 miles from a phone signal, Ms Reed was forced to run three miles to flag down a trucker.

Mr Cousins had to be airlifted to hospital where he underwent a life-saving operation.

But the artist, who did not have any travel insurance, was in for another shock when he was presented with a staggering $250,000 medical bill for his five-day stay.

If that wasn't bad enough, he was forced to return home and broke up with Dawn, who remained in the US to work. 

Despite his misfortune, Mr Cousins from Dorset, UK, insists his outdoor quickie was worth it.

'It was the most expensive sex ever,' he added. 'I haven't been able to pay it off and although it's always at the back of my mind, I have no regrets.

'Yes, I will never be able to forget that I owe so much money, but it was worth it for the sex. It's always worth it.'

But the tryst ended in disaster when Mr Cousins suffered a heart attacks moments afterwards and had to be airlifted to hospital

Mr Cousins and his partner of two years Ms Reed were living in Portugal when they embarked on a round-the-world trip in April 2013.

After months on the road the pair flew to America and started working as chefs on a cowboy ranch in the middle of the Nevada desert where they discovered the natural springs.

Mr Cousins said: 'After we started working there, Dawn and I took a walk around and discovered these beautiful natural hot springs all over the place.

'We always used to sit in them and then one day we thought it would be romantic to make love in the pool.

'When I got up there were pains in my left arm and I just collapsed.

'We were miles from the ranch and even then, there was no phone signal to call anyone. I didn't know if I was going to make it, we were in the middle of nowhere.

If that wasn't bad enough, he had to return home and broke up with Dawn (who he is pictured with at the ranch in Nevada where they were staying) who had to stay and work in the US

'It was astounding how remote it was. There was no internet or cellular signal for miles and the nearest town was more than three hours drive away.'

Ms Reed had no choice but to leave her partner alone while she flagged down the trucker who called the air ambulance on a satellite phone.

Two hours later Mr Cousins was airlifted to hospital and had a life-saving stent placed in his heart.

But after a five-day stay in Reno hospital he almost suffered another heart attack when medics hit him with a bill for a quarter of a million dollars - or £165,000.

He said: 'When I woke up I was in A and E. Doctors fitted a stent and gave me lots of drugs to keep me alive. I was in there for five days before being discharged.

'As I was leaving the doctors asked me how I planned on paying the bill. I was thinking it would be around $5,000 but couldn't believe it when it all amounted to $250,000.'

Happier times: The couple were travelling the world together before the incident

Unable to pay the bill, Mr Cousins travelled back to the UK for further treatment while Dawn stayed on the ranch, and the couple split in October 2014, but remain friends.

Mr Cousins is still negotiating with the hospital over the bill.

He added: 'I'm just really hoping I will be able to get the debt wiped because it will affect my future.

'If the hospital decide I do have to pay back the full amount, I'll never be able to go to America again. That will hurt.

'Stupidly, I didn't have travel insurance and although I was expecting a big bill I had to do a double take when I saw it was a quarter of a million dollars.

'I was completely gobsmacked. I wasn't working at the time as Dawn and I had been travelling the world, so there was no way I could ever afford that.

'It's bizarre how things have turned out. I would be really upset if this meant I could never enter the country again.'
