A shocking video has emerged of a Canadian police officer smashing a car window and dragging the driver onto the road during a traffic stop. 

The unidentified Vancouver sergeant pulled over the man, identified as Bodhi Sattva on YouTube, because he and his colleague 'smelled marijuana'.

The motorists refuses to roll down the window and instead asks the officer why he had been stopped.

'Hit the brakes you moron. Open the door,' the cop says, but Sattva insists he has done nothing wrong. 

'I'm not playing this game,' the officer warns. 'I'm gonna break the window now in two seconds.' 

Sattva contests he has done nothing wrong and tells the officer he is on the phone to his lawyer.

The officer threatens to break the window again while Sattva says he 'does not consent'. 

Just seconds later the burly officer smashes pane of the glass and drags him out onto the tarmac.

He can be heard: 'What are you doing?' He then complains that the cop is hurting his should as he is dragged along the ground. 

The Vancouver Police Department told CBC the driver was charged with possession of a controlled substance, possession for the purposes of trafficking and obstructing a police officer.

The force also reportedly said that if drivers don't want their windows smashed in, they should just cooperate with police.  

The incident took place in November but was only released at the weekend.
