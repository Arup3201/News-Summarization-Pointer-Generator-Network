Stoke defender Robert Huth, perhaps sensing the escalation of a recent and curious epidemic, took to Twitter on Monday evening and advocated Luis Suarez starting yet another season under suspension.

He wrote: ‘Still maintain that crying on the pitch should warrant a three-match ban.’

By then, Suarez had just about made it down the pitch, legs shaking and chin wobbling. One assumes his chin was wobbling. It was impossible to know with any certainty because, for a matter of several minutes, his shirt was pulled over his eyes. 

Broken: Luis Suarez was reduced to tears as Liverpool were held to a draw having lead 3-0 after 60 minutes

Hard man: Robert Huth is known for his rough tackling on the pitch and his harsh words off it

First when he lay on his front on the pitch, and when he made it to his haunches, then all the way to the side of the pitch as Steven Gerrard, with the urgency of a family member at a funeral, moved to protect the privacy of last summer’s cannibal. A camera was swatted away; let Luis be alone at this moment of intense suffering.

He’s Luis Suarez, a rehabilitated man, and he cares deeply about this club he so very nearly left for a better option last year. And so on.

Remember the threat of a transfer request, the days he spent training with the reserves? Nine months ago to the day, he criticised the club’s refusal to let him leave in an interview: ‘This is about the club having agreed to something, both verbally and in the contract, which they are now not honouring.’

It was bitter, nasty even. And now the crocodile tears that are becoming increasingly common.

In the space of a week, John Terry has blubbed, Ashley Cole has shed a few and Nemanja Vidic, one of the last true hard men of European football, tried to stir a will-he, won’t-drama.

Speaking ahead of his last game at Old Trafford last night, Manchester United’s Vidic, who will soon earn £2.5million a year after tax at Inter Milan, said: ‘You never know what’s going to happen with emotions. You can try to predict but I haven’t cried yet.’

Then there’s Cole. What was the meaning of his tears on Sunday? Is this goodbye? Has a year on the fringes heralded the end of Cole’s eight-year journey at Chelsea? A journey that, lest we forget, started when he ‘almost crashed’ his car because Arsenal’s offer to keep him was only £55,000 a week?

Football bonds are formed quickly and fickly. And, increasingly, it ends in tears.

Indeed, this has been the  season for them. Sometimes, they are a little more understandable. Gerrard’s tears three weeks ago, after Liverpool beat Manchester City  and when it looked as if they would win the Premier League, was touching to some people, though not all. Gazza, famously crying at Italia 90 (left), falls into the same bracket.

But don’t all these tears just cheapen raw, painful, tragic emotion? One of the most moving footballing environments I have been in was Swansea City versus Aston Villa on November 27, 2011, the day Wales manager Gary Speed died, aged just 42.

There, during the minute’s silence before the match, Speed’s good friend Shay Given was unable to hold back the tears ahead of kick-off. No-one would dare begrudge him that.

You could also feel the raw devastation of Bristol Rovers manager Darrell Clarke at the weekend, when he broke down following the club’s first relegation out of the Football League after a 94-year stay. Relegation means the loss of jobs, from the manager and players to the tea lady and kit man.

Less understandable is the reaction of a player who wanted to leave and who now mourns that he has fallen short of an ambition. Just like Terry.

If Suarez was sad on Monday night, it was for himself, for his own ambitions. Liverpool and their history likely had nothing to do with it.

Huth’s law might have some merit.
