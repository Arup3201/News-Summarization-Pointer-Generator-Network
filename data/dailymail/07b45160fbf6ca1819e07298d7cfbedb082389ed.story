A man charged in the brazen abduction and brutal captivity of a New York City businessman says he 'made a mistake' but he is 'not a criminal'.

Alleged kidnapper Eduardo Moncayo refused to discuss the allegations on Sunday but said he doesn't belong in jail.

Businessman Pedro Portugal was found this
week after being held in a warehouse for more than a month. He was 
bound and burned with acid as captors demanded a $3 million ransom from 
his family in Quito, Ecuador, according to police.

Moncayo made the remarks in a jail interview on Sunday, according to the New York Daily News. He and two others are being held without bail at a jail in the Bronx, New York.

Police released a picture of one of the suspects allegedly trying to withdraw money from Mr Portugal's account at a bank.

Police say Moncayo flashed a fake police badge to get Portugal to stop on a street on April 18 in Queens, New York.

The 52-year-old tax accountant was kidnapped as he left his office in Queens. Six members of a gang then transported him to an abandoned factory in Long Island City.

‘In many respects this thing was like a James Bond movie. He was tied to a chair, duct-taped... he was brutalized, sometimes at knife-point, threatened with death,’ Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown told the local CBS affiliate.

Portugal, who is married with six children, was found by police last Monday, after spending 32 days in captivity.

During that time he endured severe 
torture at the hands of the men who burned him with acid, threatened to 
cut off his fingers and knocked out several teeth.

Despite being constantly threatened with death, his captors strangely bought him a cake for his birthday, according to the New York Times.

He is currently being treated for ‘serious’ injuries including acid burns.

Three of his six captors have been arrested: Christian Acuna, 35, and Dennis Alves, 32, both of Queens, and Eduardo Moncayo, 38, of Lyndhurst, New Jersey.

The other three individuals are on the run and police believe that they may have fled the country, possibly to Ecuador.

Police say Portugal was approached on a Queens street on April 18 by Moncayo, who showed him what looked like a police badge, along with two other men.

He was forced into a car, a mask was put over his face, and he was threatened with a knife, and they drove away even as his leg was still hanging out of the side door.

Portugal was taken to a warehouse just four miles away from where he was kidnapped, and was beaten repeatedly, threatened with mutilation and kept masked with his hands bound behind his back.

Several men repeatedly punched and kicked him and another held a knife to his stomach as they ordered him to call his mother and ask for the $3million ransom money.

Portugal 'suffered physical injuries and has been deeply traumatized by the ordeal. The case warrants vigorous prosecution,' Brown said.

His alleged kidnappers forced him to call his mother in Ecuador, asking for the $3million ransom, authorities said.

Police, notified of his disappearance and the ransom call, though it still took weeks to find him. A team of New York police officers were even sent to Ecuador as part of the investigation.

When they got to the abandoned warehouse on May 20, they found Portugal with his hands bound, and took one of the suspects into custody outside of the building.

'I didn't treat him bad,' one of the kidnappers told investigators, prosecutors said. 'I told him it was just business.'

It is not immediately clear why Portugal was targeted. His family own property and several businesses in Ecuador but are not said to be exceedingly wealthy, according to the New York Times.
