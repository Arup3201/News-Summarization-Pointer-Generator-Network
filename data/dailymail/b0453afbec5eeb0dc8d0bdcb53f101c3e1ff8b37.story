A three-year-old boy adopted by a West Texas couple had more than 30 bruises and other marks on his body as well as signs that he was routinely injured by accident, according to an autopsy report released Tuesday.

Russian authorities have blamed Max Alan Shatto's death on abusive treatment by his adoptive parents, despite West Texas authorities' insistence that the boy's death was an accident. An Ector County grand jury has declined to indict the parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, who also adopted his half brother, Kristopher.

The autopsy report released to the Odessa American suggests that the Shattos were struggling to care for Max due to his behavioral problems and his tendency to hurt himself. The Shattos have declined to comment publicly about the boy's death.

Autopsy: The medical examiner ruled that the death of Max Shatto was an accident and an autopsy revealed he had 30 bruises on his body when he died

Accused: Kremlin accused Laura Shatto, right, of beating little Max, left, to death in January

The boy, born Maxim Kuzmin, died Jan. 21 after Laura Shatto found him unresponsive outside their home in Gardendale, Texas.

A medical examiner's investigator 
wrote in the report that she found abrasions, scrapes and bruises from 
head to toe on Max's body. Alan Shatto told authorities that the boy hit
his head against items in the home and had serious behavioral problems.

He said a doctor had prescribed the 
anti-psychotic drug Risperidone, but the couple stopped giving Max the 
drug after about four days after reading about the side effects and 
because it appeared the boy was having trouble swallowing. Laura Shatto 
reported that three days before his death, Max nearly choked on a cooked
carrot.

She said he tended to bang his head 
and claw himself, which she tried to prevent by cutting his nails short 
and having him wear gloves at night.

Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died in January after being adopted by a family in Texas. An Ector County grand jury has declined to indict the parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, who also adopted his half brother, Kristopher

Parents: The boy's adoptive parents denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made

Russian born: Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death

Russian authorities have blamed Max's
parents for his death and used the incident to justify a ban on all 
American adoptions. Bobby Bland, the Ector County district attorney, has
said four pathologists reviewed an autopsy report and ruled Max's death
to be accidental.

'The injuries on the child were not 
consistent with abuse,' Bland said this month. 'They were, instead, 
consistent with the previously diagnosed behavioral disorder.'

He said Max likely suffered the fatal
injuries during 10 minutes when he was playing outside and Laura Shatto
was in the bathroom.

Laura Shatto told authorities that on
the day of his death, Max 'began throwing a fit' when his parents tried
to take him to the bathroom in the morning, according to the report. He
eventually went back to bed and wasn't woken up until 3 p.m., Laura 
Shatto told authorities.

Outrage: Demonstrators hold portraits of adopted Russian children who have died in the U.S., during a massive rally in Moscow

Protests: This woman holds a sign that reads 'Juvenile judiciary. Give us parents back!' Demonstrators walked along Moscow streets to support the new law prohibiting the adoption of Russian children by Americans

Rally: Activists from pro-Kremlin children's advocacy groups march through Moscow, demanding the return of an adopted boy whose brother, Max Shatto, died in Texas

He and his half brother watched TV 
for some time before their mother took them outside to play on the 
family's swing set, the report says. Max was quiet and swaying from side
to side when Laura Shatto went inside the house to use the bathroom, 
she told authorities. When she returned, she found Max on the ground 
near the swings, unresponsive.

The boy was pronounced dead shortly afterward at an area hospital.

Russian authorities and state media 
have used his death to fan opposition to American adoptions. Americans 
have adopted an estimated 60,000 Russian children over the last two 
decades, at least 20 of whom have died.

The lack of charges against the 
Shatto family 'raises serious questions,' Konstantin Dolgov, a Foreign 
Ministry official, told a state-controlled television channel last week.
'It turns out that the child died and his adoptive parents are in no 
way guilty of this. Moreover, they are trying to persuade us that the 
boy's lethal injuries were inflicted by himself.'

The family's attorney, Michael J. 
Brown, told the newspaper that while he hadn't seen the autopsy report, 
he knew both Alan and Laura Shatto were doing the best they could.

'They just sort of handled it as it 
came along,' Brown said, adding that 'they were not forewarned that they
had this thing they were dealing with.'

Plea: In a tightly choreographed interview, Max's biological mother, 23-year-old Yulia Kuzmina, tearfully appealed to President Putin to have her surviving son returned to her

Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating

Look of love: Alan Shatto embraces his son, Maxim, in this photo. Max's parents wrote in his obituary, 'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels. We love you and will always miss you'
