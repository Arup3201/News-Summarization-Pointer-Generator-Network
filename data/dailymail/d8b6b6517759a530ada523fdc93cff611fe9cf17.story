Tragedy: Firefighter Gary Johnstone, a married father of three fell 30 feet to his death while trying to rescue theteens

A teenage boy who was critically injured while rappelling down on a popular mountain in Arizona has died.

Phoenix police say 15-year-old Trevor Crouse died Friday evening after being taken to the hospital in extremely critical condition.

Off-duty firefighter Gary Johnstone was also killed when he fell some 30 feet to his death trying to rescue two 15-year-old boys on Camelback Mountain, fire and police officials said.

Authorities say the 50-year-old Johnstone, Crouse and another 15-year-old boy were about 200 feet up the Echo Canyon Trail around 7 a.m. when they fell.

The other boy suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

Police said the two boys were friends with Johnstone's son, who also was there at the time but was not injured. 

Authorities say it appears they were in the middle of a rappelling or rock climbing maneuver when the accident occurred on a formation called 'Sugar Cube'.

Johnstone,  an engineer paramedic and 15-year veteran of the department and married with three children, was hailed by Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton.

'This is a person who loved his job so very much, he was proud to be a Phoenix firefighter,' Stanton told a news conference. 'It was more than a career, it was a calling.'

The Fire Department's deputy chief, Shelly Jamison, said the accident was a powerful reminder of the ever-present danger of hiking in the mountains in the Phoenix area.

'Those mountains are incredibly dangerous,' Jamison said. 'The level of experience doesn't necessarily play a part in what can happen on them.'

Police are trying to determine what led to the fall but have ruled out foul play. 

Camelback Mountain, noted for its shape, is popular with hikers.
