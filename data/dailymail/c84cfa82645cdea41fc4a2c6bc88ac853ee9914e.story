It was once a symbol of U.S. supremacy before becoming a prison cell for 52 Americans for 444 days. Now, the former embassy in Tehran is a chilling museum complete with a skeletal Statue of Liberty and ghostly waxworks.

Every year, Iran commemorates the  anniversary of the 1979 Iranian revolution with its Ten Days of Dawn celebrations. On the final day, mass rallies and anti-western protests take place and the country's president addresses his people in Tehran's Freedom Square.

The embassy garnered worldwide attention in November 1979 when revolutionary students stormed in and took dozens of U.S. staff hostage - the story which inspired the film Argo, starring Ben Affleck.

Australian photographer Brook Mitchell, 36, who lives in Bali, embarked on a trip to Iran and captured these incredible pictures of the celebrations and the macabre museum.

The rooms where secret state missions were planned have been covered in graffiti. But apart from the most minor of cosmetic changes, the building that caused a global diplomatic crisis is frozen in time - and looks almost identical to its portrayal in the Oscar-winning Ben Affleck movie Argo.  

In 1979, thousands of  protesters pressed around the compound, responding to a call by the country's new leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, to attack U.S. and Israeli interests.

Of the 90 people in the compound, six Americans managed to escape the building and flee to other embassies.

Other non-U.S. citizens captured when the embassy was seized were released, but 66 were captured, including three at the Foreign Ministry, and held hostage for 444 days.

Dramatic: Iranian students climb over the wall of the U.S. embassy in Tehran just before the hostage crisis, in which 52 Americans were held hostages for 444 days in 1979

The students paraded the blindfolded hostages for the cameras to humiliate the ‘Great Satan’ that Washington had become in the eyes of the Iranian revolutionary leaders.

They demanded that the Shah of Iran be expelled from the U.S., where he had been taken for cancer treatment after he was overthrown. 

Freeing the hostages became a priority for the administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter - but nothing could be done apart from enforcing ineffective economic sanctions.

Mr Carter pledged to preserve the lives of the hostages and conducted intense diplomacy to secure their release. But his failure ultimately contributed to his losing the presidency to Ronald Reagan in 1980.

Two weeks into the crisis, Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the release of 13 female and black hostages, mostly clerical staff and members of the marine guard who guard US embassies around the world.

Another hostage, vice consul Richard Queen, was released in July 1980 after falling ill with multiple sclerosis. But the remaining 52 were deprived of their freedom for 444 days.

In February 1980, Iran issued a new set of demands for the hostages' freedom. It called for the Shah to be handed over to face trial in Tehran, as well as other diplomatic gestures, such as a U.S. apology for its actions. The hostages were finally set free on January 20 1981.

Yet Mr Mitchell, who embarked on an enlightening trip, said: 'After visiting some of the most remote and supposedly conservative parts of the country, areas that very few outsiders see, I cannot equate the term 'axis of evil' with my experiences, at least when it comes to the people I met.

'Travelling through Iran as an outsider was an unforgettable, immersive experience. 

'Open, curious hospitality was the norm. Despite being proud of their country and history, the people were largely ashamed of their government. 

'There's rebellion going on all the time; it's just for the most part it's happening behind closed doors.

'My favourite image is probably one of the lady in the striking red mask staring down the camera. After having some breakfast together she was happy for me to take her picture, and she had a really lovely way about her.

'It was the second morning of the trip and I was kind of reassured that it was all going to work out after that.'

He added that in many areas there was a  sense of desperation at the current state of the economy, with many young adults unsure of their future.

'I was frequently asked about the current migration laws back in Australia, and what I thought of the government. This was usually followed up with an invitation to share some tea,' he said.

'Even at mass anti-Western rallies I was welcomed with smiles and curiosity, which was a surreal experience in itself.'

The photographer travelled along the ethnically diverse Persian Gulf coast region, which is rarely visited by outsiders, and spent time on Qeshm and Hormuz islands, the former the site of recent military exercises from where missiles were fired from the coast to destroy a mock U.S. carrier.

Mitchell says a highlight for him was a visit to the Panjshambe Bazaar, a weekly market in the desert town of Minab, which draws some of the most remote and ethnically diverse groups in Iran to sell their wares.

'In the Gulf region many Bandari - literally meaning 'people of the port' in Persian, women wear distinctive masks made of metal which are covered with fabric, the colour and style depending on the woman's ethnic group and town,' Mr Mitchell added.

'This is a stark contrast to the black tent like outfits seen in the rest of the country.

'There was little in the way of tourist infrastructure for outsiders for much of the trip, which made daily organisation pretty challenging.'

During the trip Mitchell visited the Persian Gulf Coast and Islands: Bandar Abbas, Hormuz, Qeshm and Minab and travelled to the desert cities of Yazd and Shiraz, Tehran, including  the ancient Zoroastrian centre of Chak Chak, Ruins at Persepolis and the city of Isfahan.

In a city of nearly one million, only around 20,000 showed up for the rally, and  dispersed after just a few hours, the photographer said
