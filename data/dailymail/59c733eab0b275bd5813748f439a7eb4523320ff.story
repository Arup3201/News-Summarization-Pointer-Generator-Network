A man who was trapped on a waterfall ledge for three days was rescued by a friend who he had saved from similar circumstances 15 years ago.

Ben Severne, 48, from Hallets Bay on Lake Taupo in New Zealand, went missing while trying to cut a track in the dense Lake Taupo forest on Wednesday morning after he fell down a small waterfall and got stuck on a platform.

For three days about 50 searchers including friends and family scoured the area but it was Mr Severne’s friend of 30 years Brett Cooper who discovered him on Saturday and alerted other rescuers.

Mr Severne was shocked that his friend had tracked him down because he had helped rescue Mr Cooper in an amazing stroke of luck when he became lost during a hunting trip in 1999.

‘I said “I owed you a rescue and I’ve got you”,’ Mr Cooper told MailOnline.

‘He just couldn’t believe that I’d found him.’

Mr Cooper found Mr Severne on Saturday morning after plotting out the route he believed his friend would have taken.

He knew he was on the right track when he found a bush shirt.

‘We went through a lot of very thick bush through the stream and then we found a shirt. I was pretty sure it was his shirt because he’s a big guy,’ Mr Cooper told MailOnline.

‘Then we went down the drop off and we went down through quite a few waterfalls, probably five or six waterfalls, then I came around a corner and there he was.’

Mr Cooper said he couldn’t believe his friend was alive.

‘By Saturday I knew the chances of surviving those three nights out there were pretty slim,’ he said.

‘I knew if he’s had a heart attack he would have been very difficult to find.’

Mr Cooper said Mr Severne, who is on heart medication and has diabetes, was in very poor health when he found him.

‘He had dirt around his eyes and he was gripping his chest and he wasn’t well at all,’ he said.

‘I had some food and I put some clothing on him.

‘He was sick at least once while I was there, it must have been just the pressure of the situation.’

Airlifted: Mr Severne was stranded with his dog Whai and was winched out on a stretcher by a helicopter

Mr Severne, who was stranded with his dog Whai, was winched out on a stretcher by a helicopter.

He was taken to hospital by ambulance and he was kept overnight but was discharged on Sunday.

Senior constable Barry Shepherd said Mr Severne got stuck after falling down a waterfall and didn’t have any food but was able to drink fresh water. He added that the weather conditions were very wet and windy.

‘He was able to walk around on a small area,’ Constable Shepherd told MailOnline.

‘He couldn’t climb back up the waterfall he’d gone down and the waterfall below him was too big.’

‘He was tired, he was cold… [The temperature] didn’t go below zero but it was windy and wet which kind of exacerbated the cold.’

Fifteen years ago Mr Cooper got lost while the pair were on a deer hunting trip near Gisbon.

‘I was having trouble, I quite bushed… And I failed to meet the helicopter pick up which I should have,’ he said.

‘They had to come looking for me and he was telling the helicopter where I might be.

‘I had a fire going. They found me because they saw smoke.’
