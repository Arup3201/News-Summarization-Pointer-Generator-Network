President Barack Obama has accepted an invitation from Texas Governor Rick Perry yesterday to meet for a 'substantive' discussion about illegal immigration when the president comes to Texas tomorrow.

The White 
House had previously requested that the Republican Governor meet President 
Obama on the tarmac for a handshake upon his arrival in Austin, but Perry refused and sent a letter to the White House proposing a lengthier meeting.

'I appreciate the offer to greet you at Austin-Bergstrom Airport, but
a quick handshake on the tarmac will not allow for a thoughtful 
discussion regarding the humanitarian and national security crises 
enveloping the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas,' Perry said.

White House Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett sent Perry a response letter today telling him 'the president would welcome a meeting with you.'

'In addition, he asked me to invite you to join him for a 
meeting to discuss the situation on the border with faith leaders and 
local elected officials in Dallas on Wednesday,' Jarrett said.

Perry’s Press Secretary, Lucy Nashed, told NBC News on Tuesday afternoon that 'Gov. Perry is pleased that President Obama has accepted his 
invitation to discuss the humanitarian and national security crises 
along our southern border, and he looks forward to meeting with the 
president tomorrow.'

The president's overture to Perry comes after weeks of passive aggressive back and forth in the media between the Republican Governor and the White House.

Perry has repeatedly criticized the administration's response to the humanitarian crisis at the section of the border near the Rio Grande river, telling Fox News last month, 'The federal government is just absolutely failing.

'We either have an 
incredibly inept administration, or they're in on this somehow or 
another,' he said.

'I mean I hate to be conspiratorial, but I mean how do you move 
that many people from Central America across Mexico and then into the 
United States without there being a fairly coordinated effort?'

Obama
 is traveling to Texas tomorrow afternoon to appear at Democratic Party 
fundraisers and meet with Americans who have written him letters. He is 
not planning to visit the detention facilities housing illegal immigrant
 children along the U.S. border with Mexico when he visits.

 'If he doesn’t come to the border, I think it’s a real reflection of 
his lack of concern of what’s really going on there,' Perry told Fox last week after the White House announce Obama's intentions not to tour immigration facilities during his trip.

'If the President of the United States is really 
serious about securing that border, we can show him how to do that,' Perry said. 'But I haven’t even had a phone call from this president.'

The White House has said multiple times that the president does not need to come to the border in person to witness the humanitarian crisis because high-level administration officials are keeping an eye on the situation and giving him regular updates.

During his daily briefing last Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said 'the most important thing' people like Perry could do to fix the broken immigration system 'is not offer public
invitations but actually to lend their public support to comprehensive
immigration reform.'

On Thursday, Earnest struck out at Perry again, telling reporters that many if not all of the people complaining about the president's decision not the visit the border would 'rather play politics than actually try to address some of these challenges.'

'If
 they were committed to solving the problem, you know, for example in 
the case of the Texas Governor, he could probably be pretty useful, I 
hear he's a pretty persuasive fellow, that he could pick up the phone, 
and call up some of those Republican members of Congress from Texas who 
are standing foursquare against common sense immigration reform,' 
Earnest continued.

'If
 the governor were genuinely concerned about solving so many of these 
problems that exist on the border, the most impactful thing he could do 
right now, is encourage those Republican members of the House of 
Representatives to stop blocking common sense legislation from coming to
 the floor of the House of Representatives.'

The president's preferred immigration reform legislation passed in the Senate last summer, but House
Speaker John Boehner has long said he will not allow the bill to come to a vote in the lower chamber because it makes sweeping changes to the immigration system. Boehner and his Republican colleagues favor of a series of individual bills that would gradually reform laws pertaining to immigration.

Appearing on ABC News' This Week on Sunday morning, Perry pointed the finger back at the president, saying his administration sent the White House a letter two years ago about the influx of unaccompanied minors, but the federal government did nothing.

'This is a failure of diplomacy. It is a 
failure of leadership from the administration in Washington, D.C.' Perry said.

The three-term Governor said Obama's pleas for Central American parents not to send their children to America are 'about five years too late' and reaffirmed his position that members of Obama's team are 'either are inept or don't care.'

'I have to believe that when you do not respond in any way, that you are
 either inept, or you have some ulterior motive of which you are 
functioning from,' he said.

Perry said he petitioned the president to deploy 1,000 members of the National Guard to help secure the border in 2010 but Obama dismissed his request.

Last week Perry again called on the president to send down the National Guard. The White House said today that it did not think that more personnel at the border would fix the problem.

Perry also asked for compensation in the amount of $500 million to repay Texas taxpayers for footing the bill for border security efforts that ought to be funded by the federal government.

The White House has not yet responded to that request, and it will likely be a topic of discussion during Obama and Perry's meeting tomorrow.

Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, pictured here in September, expressed concern yesterday that president Obama's decision not visit the border will become his 'Katrina moment'

Former president George W. Bush said in 2010 that this photo of him looking out the window of Air Force One on August 31, 2005, at the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina as he flew over New Orleans, Louisiana, on his way back to Washington was a 'huge mistake'

The White House announced weeks ago that it would provide more than $250 million in new aid to Central American countries to help mitigate factors that would make children flea their home counties for the U.S.

But it took until today to officially ask Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to confront the immigration crisis head on.

'With all due respect to the administration, they were one step 
behind,' on the immigration crisis, Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar told CNN on Sunday. 'They 
should have seen this coming a long time ago.'

'We should have been ready for this surge,' Cuellar, a Democrat, said. 'The administration should have been ready.'

In a follow-up interview with Fox News yesterday, Cuellar said Obama may live to regret ignoring calls for him to visit the border during his fundraising swing through the state.

'I’m sure that President Bush thought the same thing, that he could 
just look at everything from up in the sky, and then he owned it after a
 long time,' Cuellar said.

In 2005 then-President George W. Bush made the mistake of not meeting with Louisiana's Governor or other elected officials immediately after Hurricane Katrina demolished New Orleans and much of the Gulf Coast.

To make matters worse, Bush was photographed looking down at the catastrophe from the window of Air Force One on his way back to the White House from his home in Texas, where he was on a working vacation when the storm hit.

Reflecting on the incident in a 2010 interview with NBC, Bush said the photo was a 'huge mistake' and he should have went to see the disaster area first-hand at that time.

Instead, he held a news conference when he returned to Washington and designated the hurricane as 'one of worst national disasters in our nation's history,' then spent another day in D.C. before making his way down to the affected area the following day to meet with locals.

The President and his administration were widely criticized for their lack of preparedness for the crisis beforehand and their slow response afterward.

Cuellar told Fox News yesterday that Obama was in danger of having succumbing to a similar fate.

'So I hope this doesn’t become the Katrina moment for President 
Obama, saying that he doesn’t need to come to the border,' Cuellar told Fox News.

'He should come
 down.'

In an appearance on Fox News this morning radio show host Laura Ingraham speculated Obama is more worried about the blowback he would receive if he did tour illegal immigration facilities than if he doesn't.

'I think he’s worried about being seen in one of these detention facilities … because that could be a photo-op that would blow up in his face, and he’s worried about what that would look like, I believe,' Ingraham said.

'For the president to confront this face to face would be a startling picture. He doesn’t want that picture out there.'

The White House denied this afternoon that concerns about a bad photo-op were keeping Obama away from the border.
