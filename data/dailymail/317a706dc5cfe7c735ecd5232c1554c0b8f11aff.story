Jak Alnwick’s senior career was less than 60 seconds old when he landed a knee in Diego Costa’s back and his fist on the ball.

Twenty minutes earlier the rookie goalkeeper had been an unknown, sat in the dugout at St James’ Park having never made a professional appearance – he didn’ t even have a Wikipedia page.

Come full-time, the 21-year-old – thrust into the action as a half-time replacement for the injured Rob Elliot – was trending on Twitter, had given a live interview on national television and, more importantly, had made a string of saves to ensure Newcastle became the first team to beat Chelsea this season.

It was the Premier League platform which Alnwick – who had only ever made a handful of appearances during a loan spell at Gateshead - had craved, as manager Alan Pardew revealed: ‘Before Tim Krul got injured Jak came to see me and said he was disappointed in my management of him – that the club had let him down by not loaning him out.

‘But we couldn’t because he was our third choice and we couldn’t put him at risk. His contract is up at the end of the year and he felt he hadn’t been given a chance.

‘I said to Andy Woodman, our goalkeeping coach, you have to admire him. He wasn’ t really in a position to bang the door down on me – we had won four games on the trot. But fair play to him.’

Alnwick - younger brother of former Sunderland and Spurs stopper Ben - will now make his first senior start at Arsenal next weekend. And Pardew has no worries about keeping faith with the young custodian, whose best save was a reflex tip to thwart Costa in the 89th minute after he had earlier floored the same player.

‘Costa is a big guy, I was stood next to him in the tunnel. He’s a huge unit of a centre-forward. For Jak to put him on the floor was pretty impressive,’ he said.

‘It’s very unusual for a third-choice goalie to have the aura that he gave out. He was calm. For me on the sideline that gave me reassurance, I like my goalies to have that feel.

‘Jak is a North-East hero today – I have no problems saying that.’

Pardew added: ‘Jak knew that Robbie has been struggling, but we kept that quiet. He’s had a strain and hasn’t really trained.

‘He was half prepared, but we could not have been prepared for how cool he was. He took it in his stride. I have to pay a massive tribute to him.

‘He will be in goal at Arsenal now. He was great.’

Alnwick, though, admits there were one or two nerves as he went through a warm-up routine during the interval.

‘I was a little bit nervous but it was slightly easier coming on at half-time because I didn't have time to think about it too much,’ he said.

‘It was a great experience for me and I'm just happy to get the victory. Everyone backed me and showed me great support, the gaffer, the backroom staff, everyone.’
