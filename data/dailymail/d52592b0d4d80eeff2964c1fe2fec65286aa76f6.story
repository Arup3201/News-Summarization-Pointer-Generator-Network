A revolutionary new treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) has had its global launch in the UK.

Wet AMD is a disease that causes blindness in the  centre of the eye and  affects 420,000 Britons.

The condition develops when abnormal blood vessels cluster under the macula – the part  of the eye responsible for detailed central vision – and leak, so obscuring vision. 

New hope: A treatment called Oraya therapy could help improve the condition of diseased eyes

Wet AMD is the most serious form of AMD because without treatment sight can deteriorate within days.

Standard treatment involves an injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) into the eye, which prevents further blood vessels developing.

The procedure needs to be carried out between every one and three months and only prevents vision from worsening.

The non-invasive Oraya therapy is a one-time treatment and can improve the vision of a diseased eye.

It involves a low-dose but precisely focused X-ray beam on the macula to inhibit the growth of blood vessels.

The ray also has the benefit of reducing inflammation and scarring. Each session takes 20 minutes.

‘Each time the vessels leak,  it triggers inflammation, which leads to scarring of  the macula,’ says Mr Andrew Luff, consultant ophthalmic surgeon at the Optegra Specialist Eye Hospital group, which offers the treatment.

‘This is a giant leap forward for those suffering with Wet AMD,’ says Luff.

‘Oraya will dramatically improve the quality of life  for the patients.’

Although not available on the NHS, private treatment is available from £5,145.
