Peter Oakley, the grandfather who became an internet sensation with his quirky and often heartfelt YouTube videos about life, has died aged 86.

The prolific 'vlogger' from Bakewell, Derbyshire, was catapulted into internet stardom when he uploaded a two-minute video to the site in August 2005.

In the footage - titled 'First Try' - the former serviceman explains how he 'got addicted' to watching YouTube videos - so decided to take up making videos to 'grumble about life in general.'

He also posted videos about his everyday adventures, his loneliness, and his work as a radar technician.

Lat month, a short post was made on Mr Oakley's website, which confirmed he had been moved to a nursing facility due to his cancer.

The
 post on askgeriatric.com read: 'Peter has just been transferred to a 
nursing care facility, he has cancer which is apparently too far 
advanced for treatment and he is not expected to pull through.

'Please
 say prayers and or send positive energy to him and keep him in your 
thoughts, if I get more information I will update you here.'

Mr Oakley, who was born in Norwich in 1927, made hundreds of videos over eight years of being on YouTube. In some, he could be seen preparing some of his favourite dishes - such as bangers and mash, pictured

In another, the mechanic posted about not being able to find the hashtag on his keyboard

Shortly before, on 12 February, Mr Oakley posted what would be his last video. The footage ended with the words: 'In conclusion I would say my possibly final goodbye. So goodbye.'

On March 23, a post was uploaded which read: 'Peter passed away this morning at 9:30, he was in no pain.

'I’ll miss my friend and I’m sure many of you will too. I have no words right now, I just got the news.'

It is believed he is is survived by a son and a daughter.

Mr Oakley was born in Norwich in August 1927. He left school at 16 and got a job with his local authority's public health department.

He joined the Navy at 18 and became a radar technician - a period of his life which features heavily in his online posts.

Following his marriage to art student Patricia, he became a mechanic - building his workshop in an old bakery.

Patricia sadly died in the late nineties and it was his loneliness, mixed with a curiosity of the online world, that led him to vlogging.

In his first, and most popular post, Mr Oakley explains why he took up his unusual hobby.

Looking slightly off camera, Mr Oakley says: 'I um. I got addicted to YouTube.

'And the fascinating place to go to 
see all the wonderful video young people have produced so I thought i 
would have a go at doing one myself. As you can see I need a lot of 
help.

'What I hope i will 
be able to do is bitch and grumble about life in general as a person who
 has been there and done that. Hopefully you will respond in some way 
and then I will be able to do something to follow up on your comments.

'I hope you will bear with the sort of amateur production I have made.'

In his last post, Mr Oakley signed off with: 'I will say possibly my final goodbye. So goodbye'

Other videos Mr Oakley posted include one about making the perfect cup of tea - including a tip about warming the tea pot - and his thoughts on the media hype surrounding the Royal Baby.

Today, tributes to the 86-year-old continued to be left on his site.

Another, RVFC2012, wrote: 'Excellent man, did a video for me a while back and always friendly whenever I spoke to him. Fantastic human being and YouTuber will be missed.﻿'
