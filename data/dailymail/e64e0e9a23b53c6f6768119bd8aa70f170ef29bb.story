'Horrific': Peter Lizon allegedly tortured his wife and made her kneel in front of him, claims he denies

The attorney of the husband accused of enslaving his wife for ten years, chaining her up and beating her in a brutal catalogue of abuse has claimed that someone made up the allegations.

Employees at a rental store said that 43-year-old 
Stephanie Lizon, from West Virginia, hid from her husband, Peter Lizon, 37, while he 
returned a rototiller attachment.

She then went to a shelter for domestic violence 
victims, limping, gaunt, filthy and covered in scars, including a burn 
scar shaped like a clothing iron, according to police documents.

But Shawn Bayliss, Peter Lizon's 
attorney, said the allegations are 'the fabrication of a fertile 
imagination or a feeble mind, one of the two'.

'The alleged victim didn't make these accusations. It was a third party,' Mr Bayliss said. 'Stephanie would say this story is absolutely untrue, and the charges levied against her husband are blatantly false.'

He said today that he was in contact with Stephanie Lizon but did not immediately make her available for an interview.

The details of the alleged abuse came out after Stephanie fled from the couple's Leroy home on July 2 in Parkersburg, which is about 50 miles north, along Interstate 77.

She entered another part of the building while her husband was inside Bosley Rental & Supply and told the staff: 'I'm trying to get away from my husband. I just need to hide for a few minutes.'

The employee declined to give her name, citing concern for her safety and that of her co-workers at the rental shop.

In an office, the wife 'seemed pretty calm but kept looking out the window to see if he was looking for her,' the employee said.

Mrs Lizon told the staff she didn't want to involve police, but she accepted the number for the domestic violence shelter and called it, the store employee said.

She also called family to ask for money, and the employees gave her cash and called a cab to take her to a Western Union office and the shelter.

The woman was limping and had appeared to have some sort of injury, the store employee said. And while her clothing was clean, she smelled bad.

The employee also told investigators that 
the victim's fingers looked crooked, and that Lizon's wife had told her 
her husband had broken her fingers.

The husband did not come inside looking for his wife and police didn't come until several days later, the employee said.

At the shelter, however, Mrs Lizon told another woman about the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her husband, a native of the Czech Republic, according to the criminal complaint.

The wife said her family was from Alexandria, Virginia.

Stephanie Lizon's father declined to discuss the case when contacted by the AP. Relatives of her husband didn't immediately return messages.

Investigators said they have 45 photographs showing burns on her back and breasts from irons and frying pans, and scars on her wrists and ankles.

Now her husband is in jail and authorities are investigating what Jackson County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Tony Boggs called one of the most terrible cases he's seen.

'This appears to go beyond abuse to what I would consider torture,' he said Wednesday.

The criminal complaint said a witness at the Parkersburg shelter provided the following account:

She described Mrs Lizon as 'gaunt and filthy' and covered in scars, bruises and burns. She had 'mutilated and swollen' feet, a scar in the shape of a clothes iron on one breast, and burns on her back that the victim said came from a hot frying pan.

She said her husband had smashed her foot with a piece of farm equipment, among other things.

The wife said she was called a 'slave' and ordered to kneel before her husband every time she entered a room.

The wife also said she had delivered a fully developed, stillborn child while in shackles, and her husband buried the corpse on their farm.

Another child survived a similar delivery, but Mrs Lizon said the child had never received medical attention.

She had scar tissue on her hands and ankles, which police believe is from chains tearing into her flesh.

Boggs of the sheriff's office said state child-welfare authorities have been notified, but Peter Lizon's attorney said the child — a one-year-old boy — remains with his mother.

The complaint says investigators confirmed that the wife was treated in the emergency room of St Joseph's Hospital in June and that photographs were taken at the shelter to document her injuries.

A Sunbeam iron was among the items seized during a July 5 search of the couple's home. Lizon was arrested that day.

But Mr Bayliss compared the charges to the childhood game of 'telephone', where something whispered from one person to another ultimately bears no resemblance to reality.

'This is a situation where a person has taken a nugget of information, taken an acorn and tried to turn it into a tree,' he said. 'And the tree won't support this story.'

Back in Leroy, only a handful of houses dot the side of the approximately two-mile road where the couple lives.

In the front yard, signs read 'No Trespassing' and 'Guard Dog on Duty', although no dog could be seen.

One of two brightly colored barrels 
was filled with dozens of empty bottles of imported beer near a black 
van with no license plate.

Nobody answered the door at a neighbor's home. Nearby, screen doors were open and music could be heard coming from inside.

Cliff Boggess, 62, has lived in the 
area since 2005 and rode his all-terrain vehicle past the home Wednesday
evening. He said he was shocked by the news and said he's never noticed
any human activity at the house.

'Nothing. And I guarantee, that's the
same answer you'll get from everybody around here,' Boggess said. 'This
guy, whoever he (is), I've never seen him.'

Both Peter and Stephanie Lizon were 
arrested in Maryland in 2004 and later performed community service for 
cutting up Bush-Cheney campaign signs with a bayonet.

Court records also show that Mrs 
Lizon was arrested on drug charges a few months later in Baltimore 
County. She pleaded guilty and got probation.

The West Virginia Division of 
Corrections said it had no history of criminal actions by either spouse,
and Boggs said the sheriff's department had no previous contact with 
them, either.

Lizon is being held in the South Central Regional Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail.

Jackson County Deputy Sheriff Tony Boggs said: 'This is a case that is 
tenfold of what our average domestic is and maybe more than that. It 
comes down to what appears to be slavery and torture.

'It's amazing 
what one human being can do to another, and that should not ever happen 
or be allowed to happen.'
