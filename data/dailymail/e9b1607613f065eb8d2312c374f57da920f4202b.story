Insider insists bank bosses must have known about Libor fixing in 2008

Hearing: Former chief executive Bob Diamond left Barclays over the matter, before appearing before MPs this week

A former senior employee of Barclays has spoken out about a 'culture of fear' that existed at the bank - and alleged that it is 'impossible' that bosses did not know about the interest rate rigging taking place on their watch.

The banker claims disgraced ex-chief executive Bob Diamond would have been aware that his traders were involved in Libor fiddling in 2008.

Mr Diamond maintains that he knew nothing about the rate fixing and told MPs this week that he only heard about it last month.

Today's revelations follow demands from furious shareholders that the bank strips its former boss of his entitlement to an £18million bonus, while the Serious Fraud Office yesterday confirmed it is pursuing criminal investigations into the industry-wide conspiracy.

The banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Independent that Barclays executives must have been told about irregularities in Libor - a key lending rate - because staff knew they would be sacked if they did not report any such concerns to their managers.

This goes against Mr Diamond's insistence that signs of distorted Libor figures were not reported up.

During Mr Diamond's reign, the banker said, Barclays was run through management by intimidation, and some employees felt it necessary to work 15-hour days due to a brutal appraisals system that left them in constant fear for their jobs.

The insider account laid blame on the former chief, saying: 'Bob Diamond was the CEO and his policies come down through the executive committee, and then MDs and directors push that down through the firm. All of this stuff ultimately comes from the top.'

This climate of fear and fierce competition was encouraged by directors, the former employee claimed, and those who complained or appeared to crack under the pressure would be 'demoralised' and slowly 'managed out' of the company.

The unnamed insider also raised the question of whether MPs could have been more rigorous in their questioning of Mr Diamond when he appeared before a Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday.

A Barclays spokesman responded by pointing out that Rich Ricci, head of the investment banking division, had led a probe into rate-rigging and passed on his findings to the board.

Meanwhile, the SFO's own inquiry has been launched after it was put off last year because of lack of funding; its budget has been cut by 38 per cent over five years.

It has been sharing information with the Financial Services Authority from its investigation into Barclays and other banks thought to be caught up in rate-rigging.

Leading City investors say Mr Diamond, who quit this week over the scandal, should not receive a penny.

Joanne Segars, chief executive of the
 National Association of Pension Funds – one of the most powerful 
shareholder groups in the country – said: ‘Shareholders, including 
pension funds, have been negatively affected by their investments in 
Barclays.

‘This whole 
issue has been deeply damaging and raises questions about previous pay 
which now need answers. Any severance payments to top staff must be kept
 to a contractual minimum.’

Mr
 Diamond has pocketed more than £120million from Barclays since 2007, 
while pension savers and shareholders – including 719,000 small private 
investors – have seen the value of their holdings plunge.

Barclays
 is under pressure to claw back the potential £18million payout to Mr 
Diamond, who quit on Wednesday after the bank was fined £290million 
because corrupt traders had made huge profits by secretly manipulating 
Libor figures.

As the SFO prepares its 
investigation, Labour leader Ed Miliband continued to push for an 
independent inquiry into the banking scandal despite MPs rejecting the 
demands.

The Labour 
leader said that while the party would cooperate with a parliamentary 
investigation, its remit was too "narrow" and a judge-led probe was 
still needed.

Mr 
Miliband also defended the conduct of Ed Balls after the shadow 
chancellor engaged in a bitter war of words with his opposite number 
George Osborne in the Commons.

It
 followed an interview with the Spectator where Mr Osborne said former 
prime minister Gordon Brown's inner circle had 'questions to answer' 
over apparent pressure on Barclays to post lower Libor rates during the 
credit crunch.

Bank of England deputy governor Paul 
Tucker and Barclays chairman Marcus Agius, who announced his intention 
to resign after a replacement for Mr Diamond is found, will give 
evidence on the rate-rigging scandal to the Treasury Select Committee 
next week.

Mr Tucker 
was dragged into the affair by Mr Diamond, who revealed a record of a 
conversation they had in October 2008 in which the deputy governor 
relayed concerns in Whitehall about Barclays' high Libor rates.

The American banker said Mr Tucker 
was trying to warn him that "there are ministers in Whitehall who are 
hearing that Barclays is always high, that could lead to the impression 
that you are not funding yourself".

Barclays
 was dealt another blow yesterday as agencies Moody's and Standard &
 Poor's downgraded their outlook for the bank's credit rating in the 
wake of Mr Diamond's departure.

The agencies said the departure of Mr
 Diamond, as well as Mr Agius and chief operating officer Jerry del 
Missier, could lead to the break-up of its powerhouse investment arm.

Appearing before the Treasury Select Committee earlier this week, Mr Diamond was savaged by some MPs.

Labour
MP John Mann said Mr Diamond had been either ‘complicit in what was 
going on, or grossly negligent, or grossly incompetent’.

But
the former boss said he had been ‘physically ill’ when he learned of 
the behaviour of traders who rigged the Libor rates, had known nothing 
about it before last month, and did not feel personally to blame.

Mr
Diamond said emails showing that traders fiddling the rates had told 
each other ‘this is for you big boy’ and promised bottles of Bollinger 
champagne had been ‘reprehensible’.

But
he suggested other banks had been manipulating their rates while 
Barclays was telling the truth at the height of the financial crisis.

Barclays
has been fined £290million by regulators after its traders were 
revealed to have spent years fiddling the rate, based on individual 
banks’ own declarations of what they were paying to borrow.

Mr
Diamond faced the most intense questioning from MPs over a key phone 
conversation he had with the deputy governor of the Bank of England Paul
Tucker in 2008.

He refused 
to speculate about the identity of ‘senior Whitehall figures’ he said Mr
 Tucker told him had been concerned about Barclays’ Libor rate. However,
 he did suggest that Baroness Vadera, a Cabinet Office minister who was a
 senior economic adviser to Gordon Brown, had been heavily involved in 
discussions with the banks at the time.
