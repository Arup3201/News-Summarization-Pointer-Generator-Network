Joleon Lescott has played against some of the best strikers in the world, but the West Brom defender came across a real sharp-shooter when he spoke with young Aston Villa fan Moin Younis.

In an interview with BBC Midlands Today, the pair exchanged banter as they spoke about this Saturday's West Midlands derby at The Hawthorns. 

Taking part in their annual Christmas visit to Birmingham Children's Hospital, the Baggies players were doing their bit to help raise funds for the construction of a playroom for each ward... although young Moin seemed to be having enough fun without one.

Joleon Lescott met 15-year-old Aston Villa fan Moin Younis during West Brom's annual Christmas visit 

The young Villa supporter appeals to the camera as he claims Lescott was grabbing his favourite robe 

15-year-old Moin, from Handsworth, was speaking with a BBC Midlands Today reporter when Lescott emerged from the background and put his arm around him.

In true footballer style Moin flagged up the contact, as if appealing to a referee.

'By the way guys, he's just grabbed me... I'm a Villa fan,'  Moin shouted as he kissed the badge on his robe.

From here on in Lescott knew he had met his match and the sparring continued as he retorted: 'We're going to take a picture later with his robe off.

'You said you was going to come to the game (on Saturday) in a West Brom shirt!'

Quick to dispel any confusion Moin said: 'I'm Villa's number one fan... they will all know its a lie!'

The youngster even had time to mock his unlikely Christmas angel, who said he would return on Monday to give him some stick if Villa lose.

Lescott left his new friend with a high-five after telling him he'd return on Monday if West Brom win 

'He had something to say about that (Lescott's move from Manchester City). 

'He said, "why would I do it?", I said "I'm close to home now aren't I?. Back home in Birmingham"... He's even digging about my accent!'

West Brom will want to make amends for giving away a two goal lead in this fixture last season, something young Moin hadn't forgotten. 

'I didnt play,' Lescott said, 'I wasn't even there but I'm still at blame aren't I?' he asked his new friend.

Baggies captain Chris Brunt will be missing for Saturday's derby after failing to recover from a hamstring injury.

Jonas Olsson is also out following an operation on his Achilles but Saido Berahino is set for a recall after being dropped to the bench for the goalless draw at Hull and Claudio Yacob is available following a ban.
