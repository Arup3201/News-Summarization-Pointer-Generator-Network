Mark Hughes resisted the temptation to wallow in victory over the club that sacked him in 2009 but did suggest he has found a way to thwart Manchester City’s goal machine.

Mame Biram Diouf grabbed the headlines with his individual goal — Stoke’s first at the Etihad in the Premier League following six straight defeats — but the organisation of Hughes’s team was the foundation for a shock 1-0 win. 

‘I’ve faced Man City three times as Stoke manager and they have only scored one goal against us,’ said the Welshman. ‘

That’s a feather in our cap because usually they just roll over teams.’

Hughes was surprised that skipper Ryan Shawcross has again been overlooked by England boss Roy Hodgson. 

‘I think they’re missing a trick,’ he said.

Shawcross has played for both England and Wales at youth level but recently turned down the opportunity to play for Wales's senior side.

Defence: Since Mark Hughes has been in charge of Stoke, City have only scored once against them
