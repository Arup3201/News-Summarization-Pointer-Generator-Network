Designer Camilla Franks has revealed she is battling a devastating illness which has left her emotionally 'insecure and vulnerable'.

While working in India last year, the 37-year-old said she was diagnosed with the debilitating Bell's palsy - a suspected infection or auto-immune response that results in paralysis to one side of the face.

'I remember in the morning I felt tingles and a headache, and my design team were upstairs, then all of a sudden my face just dropped, and next minute I was racing to emergency and neurologists were around me thinking I’d had a stroke,' she told Sunday Style.

Doctors were then discussing the possibility of a brain tumour, before diagnosing her with Bell's palsy.

She was made to stay in India for a week to wait for test results before being told she could fly home to Sydney.

Despite working in India for seven years, Camilla said she missed home and was very lucky to be in a new relationship with The Potbelleez rocker Jonny Sonic - who was phoning her 'every second hour to make sure I was ok'.

A self-confessed workaholic, the fashionista said having half her face paralysed without any indication of how long it would take to recover was one of the most challenging and confronting periods of her life.

'I felt like I was on a roller-coaster ride of emotion. You’re put on quite heavy steroids, and unfortunately the doctors didn’t tell me what I would go through with that...there were days I just felt so depressed.

'It was a horrible experience [that could] happen to anyone, but, you know, a lot of insecurities and vulnerabilities came up.'

Those vulnerabilities included five years of suffering on and off from glandular fever, as well as the death of her younger brother Ben, who tragically fell off a cliff at The Gap in Sydney.

She said the loss changed her whole world, and said throwing herself into her work was a 'Band-Aid' solution to help her grieve.

Camilla also said she has used the ordeal to make more time for herself, and has admitted to wanting to get married and start a family.
