A two-year-old girl lost both of her legs and part of her hand after her father accidentally ran over her in a ride-on lawnmower and then dragged her the length of their driveway.

Police said the father, who has not been named, started up the mower in the garage of the family's Palm Harbor, Florida, home at around 7 p.m. and didn't notice his daughter run in front of him, apparently tripping.

The child's mother desperately tried to flag her husband's attention but he didn't see or hear her over the engine.
