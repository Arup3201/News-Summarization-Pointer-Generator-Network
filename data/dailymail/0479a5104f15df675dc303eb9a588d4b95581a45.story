Andy Lee went through eight-and-a-half long years of a pro career before finally getting his hands on the middleweight championship of the world. 

He is now adamant he won’t let go of his WBO title without a hell of a fight, no matter who the challenger — and he is determined to make sure the defence takes place on home soil.

Early signs point to former British Olympian Billy Joe Saunders to be the challenger, the undefeated European champion and mandatory challenger for the belt, but while the opponent may seem certain, the venue, at present time, most certainly is not.

Andy Lee celebrates his win over Matt Korobov after their fight for the vacant WBO middleweight title

Billy Joe Saunders may be the challenger - but he'll have to travel to Ireland to do so

‘It’s got to be in Ireland. It’s the biggest place, the biggest sell — the biggest possible arena for it,’ said Lee following his sixth-round stoppage win over the previously undefeated Matt Korobov, a fellow southpaw, in Las Vegas on Saturday night.

‘I’m the champ, I’m not going outside of Ireland, he can come to me if he wants to fight me, that’s it,’ added Ireland’s latest world champion, our 21st to hold a legitimate title, before the gentleman of Irish boxing added with a laugh: ‘Come try and take this belt away!’

The Limerick native (now 34-2 as a pro) was in celebratory mood from the moment referee Kenny Bayless had called a halt, at one minute and 10 seconds of round six in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas arena, after Korobov (now 24-1) had been overwhelmed by a fighter who would not be denied.

The Russian, a two-time world amateur champion, had left himself open for a vicious right hook, which has now become a trademark for Castleconnell man Lee.

Arguably more impressive, however, was the flurry of punches delivered by the determined 30-year-old, throwing around 18 unanswered blows to force Bayless to step in, with his 31-year-old opponent in no state to defend himself. ‘We were trading and a lot of the times he was having the better of it but my right hook is a killer punch. I thought he wasn’t going down but I wasn’t taking any chances,’ said Lee following the win, immediately giving thanks to friends, family and supporters, but reserving special praise for two men in particular.

Until Lee stopped the unbeaten man, the fight had been tentative with neither fighter able to make his mark

One was trainer Adam Booth - a calm presence in Lee’s corner, betraying the mood of the fight up until that point, as his man, frankly, looked to be on his way to a lopsided points loss.

Lee had connected with just 23 per cent of his punches (to Korobov’s 35 per cent), although he had landed 55 shots to the Russian’s 48.

Korobov had just about edged five close rounds, with Lee possibly in with a shout for one or two, but Booth obviously knew something we had not.

Lee’s other inspirational figure was obviously looking down on him, and will cash in a lucrative docket if St Peter keeps a book open for boxing’s dear departed. The late Emanuel ‘Manny’ Steward had touted Lee as a world champion from the day the young Limerick man turned pro under him in 2006.

‘I would like to say thank you to my manager (Booth), who has done so much for me over the last couple of years, but it’s also for the man who made me, Emanuel Steward,’ said Lee, speaking to HBO TV in the ring after the victory.

‘We spent seven, eight years together and he said I would win a world title. His wife, Marie, came here today, flew all the way from Detroit, so from everybody from Detroit and Kronk [Gym], thank you very much.’

The fight heats up in the middle of the ring and Lee was soon to finish it altogether with his stoppage

Thanks were also given to his wife, Maud, and a small but vocal Irish singing section.

His patriotism was a notable theme of his immediate post-fight interview with HBO TV, climaxing with a roar of ‘Up the Irish — Get in!’

Later, speaking to iFilm London, Lee was keen to emphasise that he had won the title as an Irishman first and foremost when addressing unconfirmed reports that he is the first fighter from the Travelling community to win a world title.

‘Yeah, I don’t know if that’s true — maybe the Hiltons of Canada, it could be one of them,’ said Lee, a settled Traveller.

‘It [the title] is for me, for my family, for Adam, for his family. It’s a good achievement, I don’t know how long it’s been since Ireland has had a middleweight champion and I’m very proud to be a champion from Ireland.’

No bonus points for that answer — Steve Collins claimed his first world title at 160lb after a fifth-round stoppage win over Chris Pyatt in 1995. It took the Dubliner seven-and-a-half years and two failed title challenges before reaching the Holy Grail.

Lee was forced to wait a year longer, having been voted as champion elect by everyone from Steward to the vast majority of Irish boxing aficionados after becoming an Olympian in 2004 at the Athens Games.

‘There’s times when you don’t [think it will happen],’ said Lee, ‘but you have to persevere… If you keep working hard every day and remain focused on what you want to achieve, you’ll get it eventually.’

He got it, alright — in style.
