Hopefully it will be third time lucky for a dog who has ended up being abandoned twice - because his owners can't maintain his coat properly.

Five-year-old Bosco is now looking waiting for another home while he stays at Lost Dogs Home in Melbourne, Australia

'When Bosco first came to us as a stray in December 2010, he was in a completely neglected state,' said General Manager of Operations Sue Conroy.

Third time lucky: Staff at Lost Dogs Home in Melbourne, Australia are hoping that it will be third time lucky for a dog who has ended up at the centre twice - because his owners can't maintain his coat properly

'He was given a bath and groomed, and when he was not claimed by his owners, we placed him up for adoption in the hope that he would be given a second chance at a loving home'.

When a new family stepped forward hoping to take Bosco home, nursing staff went over his needs thoroughly and emphasised the importance of regular grooming.

But they were distraught to find out recently that Bosco had been discovered wandering the streets wet, dirty and very unkempt and was brought back to the animal centre.

Miss Conroy added: 'It is incredibly 
disheartening to see that while we go to great lengths to make people 
aware of their responsibilities as pet owners, some people still just 
don't get it'.

Bosco has since been awarded the full VIP grooming treatment, including a much needed bath and clip.

Now looking and feeling his best again, Bosco has once again been put up for adoption and staff are hoping that it will be third time lucky for the adorable chap.
