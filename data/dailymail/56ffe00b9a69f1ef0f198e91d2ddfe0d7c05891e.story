A Minnesota woman has pleaded guilty to killing her fiance by tying him to an SUV and dragging him along a country road until he died.

Jessica Kilde, 33, will be sentenced for second-degree intentional murder in Becker County March 16.

Prosecutors say the mother of one from Ogema lashed Richard Baity, 41, to the vehicle using a strap around his neck last August and dragged him down the driveway and onto the road.

His body was found about 50 yards from his driveway in Maple Grove Township.

A criminal complaint says Kilde told authorities she and Baity had a disagreement that night, but that it was nothing serious. Authorities say the two had been drinking and smoking methamphetamine earlier in the day. 

According to prosecutors, at around 10.30pm on August 15, sheriff's deputies responded to a 911 call about a possible fatality and came upon Richard Baity's lifeless body along East 370th Street in Maple Grove Township, reported the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 

Evidence at the crime scene suggested that the 41-year-old man had been dragged: there were fresh marks on his neck and a broken strap was lying nearby.

Jessica Kilde was then seen behind the wheel of a Ford Sport Trac SUV, which still had a piece of a strap tied to the top of the door frame on the rear passenger side that matched the strap found near Baity's body.

An autopsy report by the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s Office stated that Baity died of ‘multiple traumatic injuries’ and ruled the death a homicide.

Police said Kilde and Baity had been drinking and smoking methamphetamine before the fatal incident 

Kilde, who according to her Facebook page at one time worked as a personal care assistant, had been engaged to Baity and the two were supposed to get married less than three weeks before his death.

The 33-year-old's Facebook wall is filled with posts expressing her love for her husband-to-be.

In December, months after Baity's death, his brother Kevin wrote an angry comment on Kilde’s social media page in reaction to an old post announcing their upcoming nuptials.

‘What she did not say is she is going to KILL him,’ Kevin Baity wrote.

According to Detroit Lakes Online, Kilde has a long criminal history, which includes a dozen prior arrests on charges ranging from check forgery and domestic assault to DWI and car theft.
