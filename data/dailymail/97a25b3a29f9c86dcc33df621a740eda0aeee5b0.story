If jumping off the earth's largest mountain - 29,035 feet above sea level - isn't scary enough, imagine doing it with the world watching.

A 30-year-old California man has not only agreed to make the first wing suit flight off the summit of Mount Everest, but is letting the Discovery Channel broadcast the event live.

Fortunately, Joby Ogwyn knows the ascent very well.

At 24 he became the youngest American to make it to the top.

Then in 2008 he set the world record for the fastest climb of Mt. Everest, making it from the base of the south side route to the summit in just nine and a half hours, when it typically takes three or four days.

Joby Ogwyn, 30, from California, will endure months of training all over the world before jumping from the Himalayan mountain in a live TV event in May

In 2008 Ogwyn set a world record for making the fastest ascent up Mount Everest. He managed the climb in just over nine hours, while it usually takes three to four days

Ogwyn said he feels that ever extreme sport he has ever done has been preparing him for the jump

'This will be the final piece of my dream,' he said.

'Ever since I was a kid, I’ve imagined what it would be like to fly.

'I can’t think of a more spectacular backdrop than Everest.

'Everything that I’ve ever accomplished in my life has just been practice for what I’m about to do.'

Ogwyn's custom-made wingsuit will be equipped with cameras to film him descending than 10,000 vertical feet at speeds of over 150 mph.

He will conduct dozens of test jumps in California, Florida, Utah and the Swiss Alps.

After extensive preparation, he will then travel to the Himalayas for final training.

After six weeks of acclimatization, Ogwyn and his team will be ready to summit Everest.

Ogwyn will wear a special suit that, along with oxygen, will be fitted with cameras that will film his jump and broadcast it live

Joby Ogwyn is an experienced wingsuiter, but jumping from Everest is not exactly an average jump

The jump is set to take place in May and will be seen in 224 countries and territories.

'This is history in the making,' said Eileen O’Neill, Group President Discovery and TLC Networks.

'Discovery Channel continues to bring live broadcast events unlike anything you’ll see on television.'

In October 2012, Discovery aired the space jump of Austrian extreme-sport athlete Felix Baumgartner.

'This will be the final piece of my dream,' Joby Ogwyn said the upcoming Everest jump

The 120,000 feet marked the highest altitude jump since a record set more than 52 years ago.

Space Jump Live was the highest-rated, non-primetime program in Discovery Channel’s history, averaging 4.21 million viewers and reaching 7.6 million.
