A former beauty queen fell to her death from a luxury Caribbean hotel after her fiance postponed their lavish wedding.

Shakara Taylor, 31, was left ‘distraught’ when her marriage was delayed by ‘the love of her life’ and a few weeks later she plunged from the roof of the eight-storey hotel.

She was buried in a white coffin in the wedding dress she had bought for the ceremony she would never attend.

Tragedy: Beauty queen Shakara Taylor, 31, fell to her death after her fiance David Ravencroft postponed their wedding

Miss Taylor met her millionaire fiance David Ravenscroft, 52, in her home town of Blackpool, when she worked as a call handler at his telephone sales company. She had been a gala queen in Blackpool and also performed in a Spice Girls tribute act the Naughty But Nice Girls.

After a ‘whirlwind romance’, the couple moved to the Cayman Islands where they enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle with helicopter flights and expensive meals.

They had been together for more than three years when they began planning their wedding. They set the date for July 6, 2013 with an ‘ecstatic’ Miss Taylor flying home to tell her father, Neil, in person.

Mr Taylor, 62, said: ‘She was over the moon. I have never seen her that happy. She loved all that girly stuff and had been planning her wedding since she was a little girl. All her friends had started booking flights and everyone was really happy for her.’

The couple were planning a ‘big white wedding’ in an Italian cathedral and Miss Taylor was looking forward to being a ‘princess for the day’.

But Mr Ravenscroft told an inquest on the Cayman Islands that in March 2013 he decided to postpone the marriage, saying they should ‘wait and see where we are in six months’ time’. He said she was upset by his decision and although she later calmed down ‘she seemed to be down in the dumps and struggling to deal with it’.

Talented: Miss Taylor was also an accomplished dancer - a morris dancing world championship runner up and also a member of a successful Spice Girls tribute band 

A few weeks later, in May, she dropped him off at a health club and gave him a hug and kiss goodbye, promising to pick him up later.

CCTV footage from the Caribbean Club, which is on the seafront on Grand Cayman, the island where they lived, showed Miss Taylor arriving at the hotel and getting a lift to the seventh floor. Footage taken shortly afterwards showed her body on the ground outside the building. A post-mortem examination found that Miss Taylor died from serious injuries to her head and body sustained in the fall.

Queen’s Coroner Eileen Nervik said no one witnessed her fall, with no evidence of anyone else present when she died.

A laptop and iPad belonging to Miss Taylor did not show a suicide note. Medical records confirmed she had a history of mental illness including a period of residential psychiatric care.

The inquest heard Mr Ravenscroft only found out after her death that she was bipolar and had twice attempted suicide.

Miss Taylor’s records showed clinical depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, an eating disorder and alcohol and drug abuse. A jury delivered an open verdict. Another inquest is to be held in Britain later this year.

Miss Taylor spent 15 years with the Crusaders Morris Dancing Club in Blackpool and was runner up at the world championships.

More than 400 mourners packed into her local church in Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool, in 2013 for her funeral.
