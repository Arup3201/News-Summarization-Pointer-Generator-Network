Mixed messages: Canadian Luka Magnotta, 32, admitted in court to killing and dismembering his lover in 2012, but pleaded not guilty to each charge

The so-called 'Canadian cannibal' laid out his homicidal plans in an email to a London journalist, who will testify in his trial, it has been claimed.

Luka Magnotta is accused of dismembering and eating his lover in 2012 and his trial got under way on Monday, with the prosecutor alleging the crime was planned six months in advance, with the killer having warned a newspaper that he would move on from killing kittens to murdering humans.

Magnotta is accused of posting a video online that showed him stabbing and having sex with the dismembered corpse of Jun Lin, 33, in Montreal, including eating some of the body parts while mailing others to political parties and schools.

Sun reporter Alex West reportedly interviewed Magnotta six months previously about claims he had been posting videos online showing him butchering kittens.

The newspaper then received an email from Magnotta hinting that he would kill humans next.

The email said: 'This time the victims won't be small animals. You see, killing is different than smoking. With smoking you can actually quit. Once you kill and taste blood, it's impossible to stop.

'I will send you a copy of the new video.' 

Crown prosecutor Louis Bouthillier said: 'It is our position that this email makes it clear that Mr. Magnotta was planning to kill a human being and that he was going to make a movie of that killing.' 

Quebec Superior Court Justice Guy Cournoyer told a jury Magnotta, 32, admitted this morning to the acts underlying the five charges against him, including killing Jun Lin, but he also pleaded not guilty to each charge.

Wearing a grey sweater, dark pants and dark-rimmed glasses, an impassive Magnotta stood behind a metal-and-glass enclosure in court this morning. 

The presiding judge said the jury will have to decide whether the acts were committed ‘with the required state of mind for each offense’ or, in other words, whether Magnotta was of sound mind.  

His defense is expected to claim that he was insane as it fights a murder charge and four others: committing an indignity to a body; publishing obscene material; criminally harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other members of Parliament; and mailing obscene and indecent material.

Defense attorney Luc Leclair told the court Magnotta is a diagnosed schizophrenic.

'The issue of whether Mr. Magnotta is exempt from criminal responsibility will be the issue you will have to deliberate on,' he said. 

Bouthillier warned the jurors to expect 'graphic' and 'gruesome' evidence, including the video and photographs of Lin's dismembered body. 

Defense attorney Leclair said his witnesses will likely include Magnotta's father, Donald Newman, a diagnosed schizophrenic. Magnotta, who was born in Scarborough, Ontario, legally changed his name from Eric Newman in 2006.

'I expect that his father will tell you about the family background and how life was for Mr. Magnotta and the family,' Leclair said.

Jury selection for the trial, expected to be one of the most sensational murder trials in Canadian history, took two weeks as the prosecutor and Magnotta's lawyer chose from some 1,600 candidates in an attempt to find impartial jurors that are as yet unswayed by the intense publicity surrounding the 2012 murder and manhunt.

‘You must avoid all media coverage of this case,’ Justice Cournoyer told the eight women and six men selected to sit as jurors. ‘Keep an open mind as the evidence is presented.’

Two of the 14 jurors will be dismissed at the end of the trial with the remaining 12 left to deliberate.

Cournoyer told jurors not to ‘tweet’ about the trial.

A publication ban imposed by the court bars media from reporting certain details of the case. Explicit details were publicized during the international search for Magnotta, but cannot be repeated.

The case quickly gained international notoriety after a package containing a severed foot was found at the headquarters of Canada's ruling Conservative Party in May 2012.  

That same day, a hand was discovered at a postal facility, in a package addressed to the Liberal Party of Canada.

Lin's torso was found in a suitcase at a garbage dump outside Magnotta's apartment building in Montreal. About a week later, the missing foot and hand were found mailed to two schools in Vancouver.

Magnotta was eventually arrested in an Internet cafe in Berlin, where he was reading about himself, following an international manhunt. 

Lin's father, Diran Lin, traveled from China to attend the trial, which is expected to last between six and eight weeks with testimony from 60 witnesses. Magnotta faces life in prison, if convicted. 

Jun Lin was born in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. He had only been living in Canada since 2011, realizing a long-standing dream by coming to Montreal.

His family has said that Lin had a comfortable life working in IT at Microsoft's Beijing office, but had sought a move to Canada to study and to improve his life.

At the time of his death, Lin was enrolled as a computer engineering student at Concordia University and worked as a part-time convenience store clerk in south-central Montreal.
