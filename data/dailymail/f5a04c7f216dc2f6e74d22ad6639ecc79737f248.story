Bionic mother Corinne Hutton will become the first person in the UK to have a double hand transplant in September

When ‘bionic mum’ Corinne Hutton had both hands and feet amputated because of a devastating illness she promised her five-year-old son she would be re-built.

One year later she’s been true to her word.

The 44-year-old had two hi-tech prosthetic legs fitted, she was recently given a £35,000 robot hand and now she’s had the go ahead for the final and most astonishing piece of the remarkable human reconstruction.

Mrs Hutton is to undergo the UK’s first double hand transplant later this year.

The operation will be carried out by Professor Simon Kay, the same surgeon who successfully performed the first single hand transplant last year.

And if all goes well son Rory will ‘get his mummy back’ as promised.

Businesswoman Mrs Hutton, of Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, set up the charity Finding Your Feet within days of losing all four limbs in June last year.

Thanks to the funds raised through her charity, the outdoor enthusiast, who has previously run a marathon, has already managed to ride a bike and is determined to be walking and running in the hills again before long.

Mrs Hutton was accepted for the publicly-funded life-changing surgery at Leeds General Infirmary after undergoing rigorous physical and psychological tests.

If the operation goes well Mrs Hutton should get some sensation in her hands immediately, but it could take many months for the new hands to settle down and function to improve.

The mother-of-one will take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of her life. However, she believes she is in a win-win situation.

‘I thought with a transplant they’d cut away my wrists and if it failed I’d be much worse off. But they said the donor’s hands would attach to my wrists and therefore if it fails I’m no worse off.’

Mrs Hutton, who owns a Glasgow-based graphics company, said she had already spoken to the first hand transplant patient Mark Cahill, 51, about the operation.

‘I've been told that it's psychologically tough. I like to think that I'd be grateful to whoever had given me those hands. I spoke to Mark and he agreed that was his angle on it.’

Mrs Hutton, who is mother to five-year-old Rory, lost both hands and lower legs in June last year, when a bad cough turned into pneumonia and septicaemia and her vital organs began to shut down

The 44-year-old already has two bionic hands, allowing her to carry out day-to-day tasks, as well as a pair of 'cosmetic' hands

The double hand transplant surgery – likely to be carried out in the autumn - will involve four surgical teams and skin from the donor’s forearms will be used to cover scarring on Mrs Hutton’s arms.

Professor Kay said the operation will be more complex than surgery on Mr Cahill but he told the BBC he believed the results will be ‘exceptional’.

It will certainly cap an astonishing transformation from the moment when doctors gave Mrs Hutton just a 5 per cent chance of survival as she fought for her life in hospital.

'I just want to be a normal mum who can do normal things for Rory and normal things with Rory'

Her ordeal began when a bad cough turned into pneumonia and septicaemia. Her vital organs began to shut down.

Mrs Hutton was flown down from Glasgow to a specialist unit in Leicester. She was linked up to an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machine to oxygenate her blood and it saved her life.

She returned to Glasgow, but the illness and her treatment starved her hands and feet of blood and the devastated mother required a quadruple amputation. Her hands were cut off from the wrists and her legs from below the knees.

Mrs Hutton bravely endured seven operations, spending 30 to 40 hours in theatre, but immediately set about getting back on her feet.

The first stage of Mrs Hutton's re-building operation took place earlier this year when she travelled to Dubai to be given two state-of-the-art prosthetic legs costing £16,000. It is set to be completed this September when Mrs Hutton becomes the first person in the UK to have a double hand transplant

She formed a charity to raise funds to help her and other people in her situation and so far it has raised around £200,000 from a variety of events.

The first stage of her re-building operation took place earlier this year when Mrs Hutton travelled to Dubai to be given two state-of-the-art prosthetic legs costing £16,000.

Then earlier this month she was fitted with a ‘bionic’ left hand, which picks up signals from her brain telling her to point a finger or clench her fist.

‘I’ve learnt to do a lot of things, I can use my smartphone, I do my own make up with both hands, I can dress myself, but there are a lot of things I can’t do,’ said Miss Hutton, who also has fake ‘cosmetic hands’.

She said her son had ‘got his mum back’, adding: ‘I just want to be a normal mum who can do normal things for Rory and normal things with Rory.’

That process should be complete with the ground-breaking double transplant operation.
