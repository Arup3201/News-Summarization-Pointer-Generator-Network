It is a moment in a woman’s life when she would probably prefer a little privacy.But fate robbed Kim Leighton of that option.

The 25-year-old gave birth in the street after realising she wouldn’t make it to hospital...and the whole thing was captured on CCTV.

Security guards assumed she was drunk when they spotted her staggering outside a shopping centre in the early hours.

Baby on board! Kim cradles Leanne as she is taken to hospital. The mother says that she will show the footage to her daughter when she is older

It was only when she sat down on the pavement that they realised she was in labour – and ran to help her.

The footage, released with Miss 
Leighton’s consent, shows the moment she brought baby Leanne into the 
world at 2am outside the Eden Centre in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

Kim gave Leanne the middle name in honour of the shopping centre where she was born

She had left her flat to head for the hospital after going into labour.

But as her mother Sue, 54, led her 
towards the car, she realised Leanne would not wait any longer, and the 
baby arrived within minutes. 

Miss Leighton said: ‘While my mum was helping me down the stairs to the car, I could feel the baby’s head coming out. 

‘My mum said “No, she’s not”, but I 
could feel it so I took my trousers off in the street, I pushed and the 
baby was in my mum’s arms.

'The security guards saw what was happening on CCTV and rushed round with blankets and kept me calm until the ambulance arrived.

'The neighbours certainly know about it – I made enough noise!’ 

Miss Leighton had gone about her daily chores as normal, including picking up son Lewis, four, from school.

At 11pm her waters broke and she 
spoke to staff at Wycombe Hospital, but they advised her she had plenty 
of time and to take painkillers.

When the hospital eventually asked her to come in at 1.45am, she called her mother.

As the street drama unfolded, 
paramedics gave instructions over the phone and Leanne Eden, named after
the shopping centre, was delivered by Sue several minutes later.

Miss Leighton added: ‘At the moment 
her place of birth is down as “Other” so I will have to explain to her 
and show her the footage. It’s amazing how clear it is on the video.

‘I’ll never be able to lie to the children where babies come from . . . they’ll only need to look at the film!’
