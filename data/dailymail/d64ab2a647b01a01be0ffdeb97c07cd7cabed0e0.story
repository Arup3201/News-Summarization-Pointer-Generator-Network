New Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella has been awarded a new pay deal worth an estimated $84.3 million according to documents filed with securities regulators. 

The pay package includes once-off stock options worth $79.8 million which he cannot receive until 2019. 

Nadella became Microsoft's third CEO in February. The Seattle based company awarded the massive stock option to provide a long-term incentive to remain as head of the technology company.

His pay package includes a once-off stock option worth $79.8 million and basic pay of almost $1 million 

According to Reuters, the company's top executives do not have employment contracts with the firm so large stock options are used to encourage loyalty.  

Two weeks ago Nadella urged women in technology not to ask for pay rises and instead rely on 'karma' to get ahead in the industry. 

The documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission said Nadella should receive stock worth $59.2 million as long as the company's share price exceeds Standard & Poor's 500 index. He also received $13.5 million to remain at the company while they searched for its next CEO.

According to the returns, Nadella's basic salary this year was $918,000 with a cash bonus of $3.6 million. He also received an annual stock award of more than $7 million. 

Next year, Nadella is set to earn $18 million, with a base salary of $1.2 million and a maximum cash bonus of three times his basic pay. He will also receive shares worth $13.2 million. 

Nadella was forced to apologise after he appeared at an event designed to promote the role of women in technology companies. 

However, Nadella, pictured, recently caused controversy when addressing a seminar on women in technology

Satya Nadella was forced to retract his statement that women should rely on karma rather than pay rises  

When asked about what a woman who feels uncomfortable asking for a pay rise should do, Nadella replied: 'It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.'

He said not asking for a raise was 'good karma' and that the boss will realise that the employee should be trusted and given more responsibility. 

However, he was later forced to retract his statement claiming that he was 'completely wrong', insisting that 'men and women should get equal pay for equal work'.
