'Shaken beyond belief': Sarah Newton, who was made deputy chairman of the Tory party last month, said she had always thought of osteoporosis as an 'old woman's disease'

A rising star of the Conservative Party has spoken of her shock at being diagnosed with osteoporosis after falling outside the Houses of Parliament and breaking her hip.

Sarah Newton, who was made deputy chairman of the party last month, said she was ‘shaken beyond belief’ at learning she had developed – at 51 – what she had always thought of as an ‘old woman’s disease’.

Her surprise was compounded when doctors revealed that the likely culprit  was a chronic shortage of vitamin D, caused by a lack of sunlight.

After her accident in May, Mrs Newton, a mother of three, spent almost four months in a wheelchair and on crutches.

After a brief period of recuperation she  managed to continue working and attend key debates in the Commons.

She has decided to speak out for the first time to mark World Osteoporosis Day and to encourage other women to take simple steps to protect their health.

Osteoporosis, or brittle bone disease, is a hidden condition that many don’t realise they have until it is well advanced.

Half of all women and one in five men over 50 will at some point suffer a fracture because of poor bone health. Three million have been diagnosed with the disease, which is often the cause of the so-called ‘dowager’s hump’ in the elderly.

However an increasing number of younger men and women in their 20s and 30s are also developing osteoporosis due to poor diet or eating disorders.

Last year the Duchess of Cornwall wrote a moving first-hand account of the deaths of her mother and grandmother to the disease exclusively for the Daily Mail to raise awareness of the condition.

Mrs Newton, who won her seat of Truro and Falmouth at the 2010 election, vividly recalls reading the Duchess’s front page article, not realising that she had the disease herself.

‘I always thought, as many people do, of osteoporosis as an old woman’s disease.

‘I just wouldn’t have thought it would affect a busy, fairly healthy working mum like me,’ she said.

Mrs Newton, who has been married to husband Alan for 25 years and has three children aged 22, 20 and 15, was rushing to a meeting outside Parliament when she tripped on the pavement and fell.

When a cup of tea and couple of painkillers didn’t stop the pain she went to St Thomas’s Hospital where doctors found she had broken her hip.

‘Thankfully the doctors there were very switched on and realised that something must be badly wrong for a woman of my age to suffer such a catastrophic break, simply by tripping on the pavement,’ she said.

Soon afterwards she was diagnosed as having osteoporosis and was told her body was chronically short of vitamin D, essential for building healthy bones and absorbed into the body through sunlight.

‘The irony that, as a very fair skinned woman, I had been slapping Factor 50 sun cream over myself for years to prevent skin cancer but had probably caused my body to develop something equally serious, was horrifying,’ she said.

Since her diagnosis Mrs Newton has been taking vitamin D and calcium supplements and will be seeing a consultant to discuss other options this month.

‘Although I was terribly shocked at the time, I feel that what happened really has been a blessing as I could have gone on for years and years with my bones getting weaker and weaker. At least now I have the chance to do something about it.’
