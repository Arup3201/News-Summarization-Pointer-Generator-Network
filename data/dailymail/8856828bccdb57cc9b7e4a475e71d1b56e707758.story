If you're going to learn to box, then why not be taught by the best?

Pop star Justin Bieber has been picking up the tricks of the trade from Floyd Mayweather Jnr who took him on the pads in his Las Vegas gym.

Bieber has long been part of Mayweather's considerable entourage and has been nicknamed 'Moneybags' by the pound-for-pound No 1.

The 20-year-old is shown boxing from a southpaw stance and throws several jabs as he takes a break following his latest tour.

Mayweather, meanwhile, has revealed he is considering putting on a show in London later this year having visited the city as part of a whistle-stop European tour.

'I went back to Paris before going to London, England to look at some different venues because I'm looking to do a show out there in December,' he told fighthype.com. 'Not me, but Mayweather Promotions.'

A video of Mayweather being accosted by a woman in a Brixton barbers went viral after she claimed not to know who he was.

'There's a lot of people that may not know who Floyd Mayweather is,' he added. 'You must realize this, there's a difference between me and any other athlete. 

'You have to pay extra money to see me; you can watch them for free. You can just turn on any local cable or satellite network and see athletes, but with me, you have to pay.'

Mayweather has yet to announce his next opponent as he enters the final two fights of his Showtime deal. His win over Marcos Maidana in their rematch last month took his record to 47 victories from as many fights.

British speedster Amir Khan is among those hoping to get the call but Mayweather looks unlikely to accept a fight with Manny Pacquiao.

He rubbished comments from his dad, who doubles as his trainer, which suggested a long-awaited clash with his rival would definitely happen.
