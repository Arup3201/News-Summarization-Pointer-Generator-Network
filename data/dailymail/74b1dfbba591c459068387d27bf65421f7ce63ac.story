Injured veterans have said huge delays in receiving compensation from the Ministry of Defence are like a ‘form of torture’.

Some former servicemen are still waiting three years after their claim was lodged, they said yesterday.

One veterans’ group said the average waiting time for its members had increased nearly threefold since 2010.

It recently emerged the Government has paid nearly £20million in compensation to Iraqi civilians since 2003.

The MoD insisted such claims are handled completely separately. It said it takes four to five months to receive payments for injury, illness or death caused while in service.

Former RAF Sergeant Alex Ford dismissed this as farcical, calling the delays ‘a little form of torture’.

Mr Ford served in Afghanistan and suffered a slipped disc. He left two years ago to care for his wife, a staff sergeant, who also hurt her back.

Veteran Ian Bleakley, 46, said his life has been put on hold after almost a year waiting for compensation.

The former Lance Bombardier in the Royal Artillery has had 11 operations since a shell fell off an arms truck on to his shoulder during the first Gulf War.

He had to be signed off his job at the Child Support Agency last year as a result of post-traumatic stress.

He said: ‘Things took a nosedive with my PTSD. I’ve never been in a darker place.’ 

Mr Bleakley, who was in the Army for 13 years, applied for compensation in November but has heard nothing.

He said: ‘Every day I just wait for the post. I phoned them last week and they apologised and said, “you have to understand there’s just a backlog”.

‘They said they hoped I would hear within the next four weeks but couldn’t say for certain. I’m not holding my breath. They need to take on more staff. It’s as simple as that.’

He said: ‘For anything other than a plain and simple clear-cut case, you are talking at least a year for anything to happen.’

Afghanistan veteran Chris Yates, of the Royal Engineers, is still waiting for a full review three years after a truck tailgate collapsed on him.

He suffered prolapsed discs, a paralysed bladder, severe kidney damage and mental side effects.

So far he has received only an interim payment of £3,000. He told the BBC: ‘The last time I phoned them I was told my claim had been passed on to a case worker, but it’s now just in another queue.

‘They said it might be weeks before I hear anything as they’re completely snowed under with thousands of backlogged cases.

‘This is my pension… There is no light at the end of the tunnel.’

The National Gulf Veterans and Families Association said official figures for 1991 Gulf War claims showed waiting times rose from 82 days in 2010 to 219 days in 2014.

Labour MP Madeleine Moon said: ‘We ask people to put their lives and futures on the line. If people are injured… they should have the financial help we as a nation have covenanted to provide.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are committed to dealing with all claims as quickly as possible but it is crucial every claim is considered on a case-by-case basis.

‘We have significantly improved our processes over the last three years so the average waiting time is now around four to five months.’

The MoD has so far paid out £19.3million on claims made by Iraqis against British troops, with many more yet to be heard.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘It would be wholly wrong to suggest UK veterans are left waiting while we deal with compensation claims for Iraqi veterans.’
