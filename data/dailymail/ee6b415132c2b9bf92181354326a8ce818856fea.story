Ed Miliband has been warned he faces ‘catastrophe’ at the next election if Labour continues to haemorrhage support in Scotland to the nationalists.

Senior party figures believe as many as 15 of its 41 seats north of the border are at risk – putting Labour’s hopes of victory at Westminster in May under threat.

One former Scottish first minister said that, just weeks on from helping to win the independence referendum, Labour risked ‘snatching defeat from the jaws of victory’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has been warned the collapse of the party in Scotland could scupper his hopes of becoming Prime Minister in May next year

The warnings came in the wake of Johann Lamont’s resignation as Scottish Labour leader late on Friday night.

She accused Mr Miliband of treating Scottish Labour like a ‘branch office’ and dubbed some Labour MPs ‘dinosaurs’.

Two new polls, covering the whole of Britain, showed that both Labour and the Tories were tied on 33 per cent of the vote, with just over six months to go before the next election.

Labour has traditionally relied on the near-certainly of a large number of seats in Scotland to help it on the way to general election success.

But the SNP, resurgent despite losing the referendum, is threatening to take a large number of their seats.

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond accused Mr Miliband of being responsible for the ‘meltdown’ of Scottish Labour.

Former Labour first minister, Henry McLeish, told The Sunday Times that Mr Miliband had ‘not got a clue about the realities of Scottish politics’.

‘What we’ve got is a situation after a decade that labour is still in denial in the UK and if there’s any hiccup in the number of MPs we sent to Westminster in 2015 this could be catastrophic for Ed Miliband’s effort to become prime minister,’ he said.

He questioned whether Labour could ‘survive as a social democratic party in the modern age’.

‘Electors are unwilling to vote the same way as previous generations,’ he said. ‘The power of Labour is diminishing and will continue to do so.’

Miss Lamont has said the final straw came when the UK party sacked the Scottish Labour general secretary, Ian Price, last week without consulting her.

Jack McConnell, another Labour ex-first minister of Scotland, said the issue of authority between the Scottish and UK Labour parties needed to be sorted out once and for all.

‘[The referendum victory] should have been an amazing opportunity for Scottish Labour to set out its vision and values for Scotland,’ said Lord McConnell.

‘We are in serious danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of that victory and it really is time for all of those in positions of responsibility to get a grip, to sort out this issue of authority once and for all.

‘And then for us to have a debate and the election of a new leader who can take us forward, not thinking about the internal workings of the Labour party, but with a vision to be First Minister of Scotland and help change this country for the better.’

Scottish Labour's executive committee met today to discuss the process and timetable for selecting a new leader.

Among those tipped for the leadership are Jim Murphy and interim leader Anas Sarwar. Gordon Brown has also been linked to the role but reports have suggested the former Prime Minister has ruled himself out of the running.

A new group of Labour activists want the party north of the border to make radical changes, such as changing the name to the Independent Labour Party and becoming fully autonomous from Labour's London leadership.

The Labour for Scotland group also supports Holyrood being given full control over income tax as well as complete responsibility for welfare - a position which goes further than Labour's existing plans for further devolution.
