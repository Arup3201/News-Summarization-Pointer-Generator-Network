Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has become the latest celebrity to be exposed for investing in an alleged £1.2billion tax-avoidance scheme.

The River Cottage TV chef was one of 229 individuals, including former BBC chairman Lord Grade, Britain’s highest-earning MP and footballers, who paid into Phoenix Film Partners LLP.

Each put an average of £5.2million into the partnership that offered tax breaks for investing in Hollywood movies.

Complex deals meant investors could claim substantial tax relief – potentially leaving them with thousands of pounds of profit.

It was initially approved by HMRC, but officials wrote to Phoenix investors in May last year rejecting their claims for tax relief.

Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall follows George Michael, Katie Melua, Sir Michael Caine, Gary Barlow and BBC presenter Anne Robinson who were all criticised for using a separate aggressive tax avoidance scheme in July.

Phoenix used the investor loans to buy distribution and production rights to films including the 2010 re-make of the 1980s TV series The A-Team and Gulliver’ s Travels. Investors could make significant profits if the films prospered at the box office.

However, Ingenious Media, which ran the partnership, admitted in 2011 that ‘box office performance had not met expectations’ and was unlikely to deliver ‘significant upside’. 

Regardless of the poor returns, investors were able to claim tax relief worth about half the cash they put in. Among those investing was Tory MP Geoffrey Cox QC, who earned around £400,000 last year in legal fees along with his £67,000 annual parliamentary salary.

It is not known the exact amount that each investor put into the scheme or whether they have already claimed tax relief.

Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall said he left Phoenix in June after first joining in 2008 believing he was making a ‘bona fide’ investment in the British film industry. 

He added: ‘It seems from reports in the media that HMRC does have reservations about some of these types of investments.

'I always want to be transparent about and indeed comfortable with my investments and my tax affairs, so earlier this year I resigned my subscription to this particular investment and handed back all the tax gain I had made, plus interest, to HMRC.

‘Any earlier correspondence with HMRC was handled by my financial advisors at the time. I now have a new accountancy firm and financial advisor for my affairs.’

Mr Cox said he was advised that Phoenix ‘had been submitted to HMRC and had met with no objection or query’ and he had instructed his financial advisers that he ‘did not wish to be involved in aggressive tax avoidance’.

Lord Grade said: ‘I did not regard this as tax avoidance. I wouldn’t have done it if it hadn’t been HMRC-approved.’

Ingenious denied that Phoenix, or any of its other film and music investment schemes, are tax-avoidance structures. A spokesman said Phoenix was a ‘bona fide film partnership’ that traded for ‘under six months before the capital was returned to partners in March 2009’.

Phoenix is one of more than 1,200 alleged avoidance schemes identified by HMRC where investors are being forced to hand over unpaid tax before their disputes are settled by a tribunal.
