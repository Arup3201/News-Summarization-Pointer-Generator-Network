A shopping centre had to be evacuated and 62 people required medical treatment after a suspected gas leak from a faulty supermarket fridge.

Hazardous materials officers were called to the retail centre at Hedge End, in Southampton, after staff and shoppers at a Sainsbury's fell ill at the checkout.

A neighbouring Marks and Spencer store also had to be evacuated last night.

Officers from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service entered the building in protective clothing and found the gas was a refrigerant.
