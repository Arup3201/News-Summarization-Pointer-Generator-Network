An alleged stalker who claims to be Lindsay Lohan's husband punched a theatre doorman when he refused to let him see her, a court heard.

The 28-year-old Hollywood actress was rehearsing for her upcoming West End debut in Speed-The-Plow at London's Playhouse Theatre when Daniel Vorderwulbecke, 37 was spotted lingering outside - despite being banned as part of his bail conditions.

A court heard that when security worker Cameron Ashrat asked him to leave, he was punched in the face by Vorderwulbecke.  

A 'stalker' has been accused of pretending to be Lindsay Lohan's husband and bombarding the celebrity venue, Chiltern Firehouse with threatening emails. The actress is pictured leaving the haunt

A court heard how the defendant called himself King Lionheart, said he was married to Miss Lohan and had certificates to prove it and spoke to the actress every day personally and through social media

It was alleged that the assault was the climax of a campaign of harassment by Vorderwulbecke against the actress and staff at the celebrity venue, Chiltern Firehouse.

Westminster Magistrates' Court heard he bombarded the celebrity haunt with emails claiming the celebrity was his wife and demanding bookings be made for him.

The defendant also called himself King Lionheart, said he was married to Miss Lohan and had certificates to prove it and spoke to the actress every day personally and through social media. 

It was also alleged that he did not get jealous but became concerned when she was pictured with other men.

On his Facebook account, under the name Dan Cortez, Vorderwulbecke describes himself as Lindsay Lohan's husband. 

Prosecutor Rav Chodha said: 'Police were initially called by staff at the Chiltern Firehouse which is a restaurant and hotel popular with high profile celebrities.

'They started receiving emails and booking requests, and inquiries from the defendant who claimed that his wife was Lindsay Lohan.

'Along with the booking requests, the defendant also sent various photographs and documents over a three month period.

'The defendant has sent over 60 images to hotel reservations and to various email addresses, and those emails are also described as being strange, bizarre, threatening and homophobic in nature.'

Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Daniel Vorderwulbecke, 37, bombarded celebrity haunt, Chiltern Firehouse, with emails claiming the celebrity was his wife and demanding bookings be made for him

The court heard that Laura Pearce, a member of staff at the popular celebrity venue, also received a number of emails from Vorderwulbecke and became concerned about the 'level of abuse and threats' they contained.

Police were informed and Vorderwulbecke was arrested near the Playhouse Theatre on August 27 where Miss Lohan was rehearsing ahead of the Speed-The-Plow show that opens on September 24.

The defendant was interviewed by police and bailed on the conditions that he would not contact Miss Lohan or Ms Pearce, not enter the City of Westminster and surrender his passport.

But the next day, the police were called again to the Playhouse after Vorderwulbecke attended and passed a note to the staff asking for it to be passed on to Miss Lohan. 

He was warned about breaching his bail conditions and after confirming to police he understood them, he was released again.

But on September 8, police were called to the Playhouse Theatre again, where Vorderwulbecke had allegedly caused damage to a metal cigarette bin valued at £100.

Three days later, on September 11, he allegedly assaulted security worker Mr Ashrat.

Dressed in a dark beige sweatshirt and grey cargo pants, Vorderwulbecke, of no fixed address, gave a brief rant in German - with the words 'King Lionheart' audible - when asked to confirm his name.

The case was adjourned until September 18 so that his mental health can be assessed and he was remanded into custody.

He is charged with harassment, assault and criminal damage.
