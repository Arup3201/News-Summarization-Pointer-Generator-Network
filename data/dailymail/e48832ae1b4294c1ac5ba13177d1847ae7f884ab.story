Nikki Westgarth, pictured with her son Jake Grimes, died from flu four days after giving birth to her second child Eva Rose 

A 21-year-old mother-of-two died of flu four days after her baby daughter was delivered via emergency C-section.

Nikki Westgarth never got to meet  Eva Rose Westgarth-Burrell, who was born on February 4.

Lying in a critical condition in hospital, doctors made the decision to deliver her unborn child via C-section.

But four days later Miss Westgarth lost her life to the common illness.

Her mother Kim Hannant is now bringing up Eva and her older brother Jake Grimes, four.

The 57-year-old is now calling for all women in at-risk groups to ensure they have a yearly flu jab - an injection that could have saved her daughter. 

It was shortly after Christmas last year that Miss Westgarth began to feel tired and run down.

But Mrs Hannant said the family just attributed it to her being pregnant.  

'Then just after New Year, the whole family came down with the flu,' she said.

'I have asthma and I've had my jab for the last 10 years, so didn't suffer as much as everybody else.

'Nikki lived next door to us, and she came in and complained that she felt like she was dying. 

'I thought she was joking, but she was so concerned that she went to hospital, but wasn't admitted.

'The next day she was still very concerned so went to hospital, who admitted her to maternity. 

'Once the family were given the all clear from flu, we were able to visit her. She was in good spirits, but said she was in a bit of pain. However whilst I was there, she said she'd started to cough up blood.

'After helping her out of bed to go to the toilet I went to help one of the nurses with some paperwork, and when I came back I couldn't find Nikki. 

The 21-year-old's mother Kim Hannant, pictured with Eva Rose and Jake, is today urging all pregnant women to ensure they have the seasonal flu jab, which is available free of charge to all expectant mothers, as well as others in at risk groups including anyone over the age of 65 and people with existing health problems 

The flu jab is available every year on the NHS to protect adults and some children, at risk.

Flu can be an unpleasant illness. But for those who are otherwise healthy, it usually clears up on its own within a week.

However, for some people the illness can be much more severe, even life-threatening.

Those at risk include:

Anyone in a risk group is likely to develop serious complications, such as pneumonia.

The flu vaccine is given free of charge to:

The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November.

For those not deemed at risk, it is possible to pay to have a flu jab. Boots Pharmacies are offering the vaccination in store.

Deepa Songara, Boots flu pharmacist said: 'We spend less time outside and much longer closer together at home or in indoor places. 

'This 'togetherness' makes it easier to pass germs from one person to another so it is important to think ahead and try to protect yourself before the cold and flu season really kicks in. 

'Busy communal places are ideal breeding environments for winter bugs and simple things like washing your hands or using alcohol based hand gel can help keep you well.'

'I went to the bathroom and found her slumped behind the door. The nurses worked quickly to get her back on to the bed and monitored her very closely.'

Miss Westgarth, of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, came round but her condition took a turn for the worse.

She was treated in critical care at Darlington Memorial Hospital for two weeks.

Mrs Hannant said: 'She was very agitated and kept saying to me "please mam, don't let me die".

'She was sitting up and talking and about four in the morning they said I would be fine to go home and get some sleep.

'But very quickly after arriving home I got a call that I needed to go back to the hospital as Nikki had taken a turn for the worse and was in critical care. The doctor told us that the baby was fine, but at this stage we were more concerned about Nikki.'

As her condition deteriorated doctors arranged to have her transferred to a hospital in Leicester to give birth to Eva Rose with specialist support.

It was while she was in critical care that Miss Westgarth turned 21.

Her mother said: 'She briefly came round from life-support and was given a Caesarean section to deliver Eva Rose as she was suffering pre-eclampsia.

'She never got to see Eva Rose before she died.  

'Four days later, whilst I was away from the hospital resting, I was called back. When I got there, the nurses told me that Nikki's heart had stopped, we'd lost our little girl.'

Her relatives are now backing this year's national NHS campaign urging people, including pregnant women, to make sure they have a flu vaccination. 

Mrs Hannant added: 'If it saves even one person, and saves one family from going through what we went through then her death wasn't for nothing.'
