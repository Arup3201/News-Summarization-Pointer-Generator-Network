It's the most fearsome  creature that ever lived and could have devoured a Tyranosaurus-Rex for breakfast… and it is called Kevan.

The Pliosaurus kevani, to give it its proper name, ruled the oceans 150million years ago.

Equipped with a massive jaw studded with 12in teeth, the ‘sea rex’ had the biggest bite in history.

The sea monster has been named Pliosaurus kevani after Kevan Sheehan, the retired café owner who spent five years painstakingly unearthing it

Dr Richard Forrest assembling the giant skull. Experts have hailed the fossil find as one of the most significant in the world and one of the most complete and best preserved skulls ever uncovered

The colossal creature has been named 
after fossil hunter Kevan Sheehan, who described the honour as ‘a great 
day for Kevans all over the world’.

Mr Sheehan, a cafe owner, unearthed 
fragments of the creature’s 8ft-long skull after they fell from cliffs 
on the World Heritage Jurassic Coast in Dorset.

It took him five years to collect the pieces during daily walks along the beach.

Every time he found a new fossil, he put it in his rucksack and hauled it to his clifftop home.

The largest piece weighed more than 12 stone and he believes his hobby cost him two knees and a hip.

British scientists have identified a new species of a huge pre-historic sea monster. It is believed to have been the most powerful creature on earth

Now his efforts have been  officially acknowledged.

Mr Sheehan, 68, from Osmington, near Weymouth, said: ‘This has been a real labour of love for me, but it was all worth it.

‘I guess it’s my legacy and it’s a great day for Kevans all over the world.’

The four-flippered pliosaurus would have weighed 12 tonnes, could have swallowed a great white shark whole and had a bite powerful enough to rip a car in half. Mr Shhehan said: 'I stumbled across the remains thinking they were fossilised wood and only picked them up because I thought they had a nice grain'

The 60ft-long monster had a large head, short neck and a teardrop-shaped body.

Two sets of powerful flippers and a thrashing tail allowed it to rapidly propel itself through the water in pursuit of prey.

Although remains of other pliosaurs have been found before, the 
‘Kevan-asaurus’ is distinct enough to have been declared a  new species.

Dr Roger Benson, of the University of 
Oxford’s earth science department, said: ‘This pliosaur was much larger 
and stronger than other pliosaurs and had more teeth.

‘Its lower jaw was very long from front to back whereas other species of pliosaurs had shorter ones.

‘Its teeth grew upwards and outwards compared to other pliosaurs’ teeth that went straight up.

‘This discovery is very significant for British palaeontology.

‘Several other pliosaurs have been found since the 1820s, but they are fragmentary compared to this one.’

Mr Sheehan sold his find to the county council for £10,000.

The reconstructed skull, which is 95 per cent complete, is now on display at Dorset County Museum  in Dorchester.
