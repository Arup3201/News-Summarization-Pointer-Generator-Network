Eighteen-year-old Nolan Burch died two days after being found without a pulse in a West Virginia University fraternity house

A West Virginia student was six times above the legal alcohol limit when he was found without a pulse in a fraternity house.

Nolan Burch, 18, had a blood-alcohol level of .493 following a night of events with WVU's Kappa Sigma chapter, police in Morgantown revealed.

The legal limit is .08, though it is .02 for those under 21. 

The freshman from Buffalo, New York, died on November 14, two days after being taken back to the fraternity house after a night of heavy drinking.

Police say that Burch, who was just two months into his university career and planning to major in pre-sports management, and 19 other young men were blindfolded and taken to another house to drink large amounts of alcohol.

Kappa Sigma had lost its charter from university shortly before but continued with the 'Big-Little' event anyway, according to WVU's student newspaper the Daily Athenaeum.

Burch was looking for membership in the fraternity and had tweeted 'It's about to be a very eventful night to say the least' the night of his death.

Officers arrived at the frat house around 11.52pm to find that Burch, who was laid on a table after returning to the Kappa Sigma building severely drunk, had no pulse and had turned blue.

A policeman attempted CPR, but could not revive the teenager.

He died in the hospital from what WVU called a 'catastrophic medical emergency' following two days on life support.

A medical examiner's report is still pending in the death, after which criminal charges may be filed.

While the amount Burch drank has not been revealed, a blood-alcohol content calculator estimates that a 160-pound male would achieve a BAC of .5 after drinking 23 shots of 80-proof liquor over a period of four hours. 

Burch had been drinking at a pledging event for Kappa Sigma's chapter at West Virginia University in Morgantown

West Virginia University put a moratorium on all fraternity and sorority activity the day after Burch died, which has since been partially lifted.

The university and its Greek life councils released a joint statement on Tuesday saying that the ban on all events with alcohol remains in place.

University president Elwood Gordon Gee said that the ban could be finished in a month after reforms that may include, according to the West Virginia Gazette.
