The culling of badgers received another setback yesterday when it emerged that only 40 per cent of the target figure had been achieved in the latest trial scheme.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson announced that the cull – to reduce tuberculosis in cattle – missed its quota in Gloucestershire, even after it was cut from 70 per cent to 58 per cent and marksmen were given an extra five weeks.

Labour environment spokesman Maria Eagle said Mr Paterson – who blamed earlier problems on ‘badgers moving the goalposts’ – had been humiliated.

Only 40 per cent of the target figure were culled in the pilot scheme which has been hailed as a success by Owen Paterson

The shadow environment secretary said: 'Despite revising downwards the estimated number of badgers and 
extending the trials contrary to clear scientific advice, Owen Paterson 
has still failed to reduce the badger population by his own stated goal 
of 70 per cent.

'The decision to revoke this badger cull licence is a
humiliation for Owen Paterson and must spell the end for his misguided 
and unscientific policy.'

Mr Paterson revealed that just 213 badgers were killed in the final five weeks of the cull, bringing the total to 921.

Presenting
the figures in a written statement to Parliament, he said: 'This 
represents a reduction of just under 40 per cent in the estimated badger
population before culling began.'

Despite failing to cull a sufficient number of badgers, Mr Paterson hailed the pilot as a success. 

The setback was described as a 'humiliating' blow to Owen Paterson

'The extension in Gloucestershire has therefore been successful in 
meeting its aim in preparing the ground for a fully effective four-year 
cull.

'I would like to pay tribute to the local farmers and 
landowners who have undertaken the pilots in both areas, often in 
difficult terrain and weather, and often in the face of intimidation by a
small minority.

'Culling is only one part of our approach to tackle 
the spread of TB. We are using every tool available including tougher 
movement controls for cattle, better biosecurity on farms and working to
develop effective and usable cattle and badger vaccines.'

Natural England announced last week 
that shooting was being halted in Gloucestershire three weeks before 
schedule, as it became clear that the revised cull target would not be 
met.

But Mr Paterson hailed the scheme as a success and said the cull was only part of the battle against TB backed by farmers and vets.

An Independent Panel of Experts will consider the information collected during the pilots.

Their report is due to be published early in 2014 and then the Government will have to decide whether to repeat the cull in other parts of England.

Mr Paterson added: 'While there are important lessons to learn, completing two pilots this year has been a significant achievement and is another major step towards halting the spread of bovine TB.'

An extension to a separate pilot cull in Somerset also failed to meet its target. The Somerset trial killed 65 per cent of badgers, still short of the 70 per cent.

The shortfalls come despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards.

Maria Eagle described the pilot as a 'misguided and unspecified policy' while NFU president Peter Kendall said his union was backing the scheme

Badger Trust spokesman Jack Reedy said the end of the cull was a 'humiliating and inevitable setback' for Mr Paterson.

'This ill-advised cut-rate shambles has involved miscalculation of badger populations, manipulated time scales, huge expense for the taxpayer in policing costs, and the fiasco of repeatedly missed targets,' he said.

'If it was not so serious it would be comical and should never have happened in the first place.' The National Farmers Union has continued to support the rolling out of further culls in other parts of the country.

The union's president Peter Kendall said: 'The NFU remains committed to supporting wider roll-out to help prevent the spread of this terrible disease.'

Government figures show more than 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in England in 2012 because of bovine TB.
