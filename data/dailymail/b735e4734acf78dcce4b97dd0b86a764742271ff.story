Caring: Denyse Sweeney was volunteering with an animal charity

A charity worker whose family were told she died of a drug overdose in Goa was found to have no drugs in her system, it has emerged.

Maureen and Marion Sweeney never accepted the official verdict from Goa that their sister Denyse Sweeney had died after an illegal drug binge.

Their worst fears were confirmed this week at her inquest at Derby Corner's Court when they were told that no illegal substances were found in her system after her death.

But it was also revealed that she had
20 bruises on her body at the time of death, including one measuring 
4.5cm on the back of her skull.

Pathologist
Dr Ivan Robinson was unable to give a cause of death and coroner Dr 
Robert Hunter said the unexplained injuries 'were not investigated to 
any satisfactory level' by the authorities in Goa.

Maureen said Denyse's body was flown back almost a month after she died, two weeks before her 35th birthday.

Maureen said: 'Her body had to be identified using a fingerprint expert because it was so badly decomposed.

'We were led to believe the cause of death was going to be a drug overdose because that is what the autopsy report we had been sent from Goa said.

'We did not accept that at all. The moment we read the words "drug overdose" we said "no".

'If we had known two years ago that whatever investigation was done by the police in India would have been so rubbish we might have acted sooner.

'We thought the British Consulate would look after her.'

Mum-of-two Denyse from Derby, who leaves behind son Ben Sweeney, now 18, and Chloe Munro, 13, was on her second trip to Goa when she died.

She was admitted to St Anthony Hospital in Anjuna, Goa, in April, 2010 in a comatose state.

The doctor who treated her had been told she had 'most probably' had a drug overdose. He was unable to save her and she was pronounced dead at 7.20am.

Friends and family organised 
fund-raising events to pay for her body to be flown back to Derby from 
Goa where she had been volunteering for an animal charity.

When
it did arrive, a second post-mortem examination was carried out despite
more than two-thirds of Denyse's brain having been removed by Indian 
doctors.

This week's inquest heard how toxicology
samples taken from Denyse's body at the time of her death were only 
analysed 20 months later following pressure from the Foreign Office.

Dr Hunter recorded an open verdict, 
saying: 'We now know she had not taken any drugs, alcohol or poison, 
flying in the face of the cause of death given in the autopsy report in 
Goa.

'That report, from the hospital where she died, said she died from pneumonia caused by a drug overdose.

'Dr Robinson was unable to give a medical
cause of death. He was concerned about the number of bruises Denyse had
on her body, in particular the bruise she had on the back of her head.

'The whole thing is not particularly satisfactory for the family or anybody.'

Speaking after the inquest on Tuesday
Maureen, 43, said: 'After Denyse died, friends who had seen her in Goa 
said she had been with this man called Alex on the night before she 
died.

'We would jump at the
chance to get out to India and see if we can find him and see if he has
any information about what happened to our sister.'
