We live in a country four times wealthier than it was when the Queen came to the throne, according to an official count produced for the Jubilee today.

But we are more likely to make our money out of shops than the metal-bashing and manufacturing that dominated our commercial life 60 years ago.

We have nearly four times as many divorces, about a third fewer marriages, and a country where people are likely to be much older than in the 1950s.

The breakdown of the differences between Britain in 1952 and Britain now was produced by the Office for National Statistics and other Whitehall departments to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, which reach their climax next weekend.

Experience: The Queen has seen her country change so dramatically since her Coronation ceremony in 1953

It showed that when the Queen came to the throne the wealth of the nation was, in raw figures, about 100 times less than it is now. Gross domestic product totalled £15,983 million, against £1,507,585 million in 2011.

However inflation has taken a very large bite out of the value of the pound over 60 years. A 1952 pound is worth £24.34 today – so that the national wealth is really only slightly under four times greater now than then.

There are nearly 600,000 men now working as shop managers or assistants or in sales, the figures showed. Retail jobs did not figure among the top five occupations for men 60 years ago. Instead, there were more than 400,000 men in metalworking, engineering and electrical trades, and nearly 400,000 more classed as unskilled industrial labourers.

Different industries: Sixty years ago there were more than 400,000 men in the metalworking industry whereas now more men work in retail

Non-committal: We have nearly four times as many divorces, about a third fewer marriages than in 1952, according to the Office of National Statistics

In 1952 there were more than 370,000 women working as domestic servants and 215,000 classed as charwomen or office cleaners. Today, there are more women working as domestic cleaners – 384,000 – and a further 446,000 in the booming care industry, working either as care home assistants or home carers.

A second report, from the Department for Work and Pensions, reveals the scale of the extraordinary social change in Britain as people are living longer than ever before.

In 1952, there were just 300 centenarians in England and Wales. Today there are around 13,420 people alive today who have celebrated their 100th birthday.

Over the last 60 years, the department estimates the Queen has sent around 110,000 telegrams and messages to people who have reached the landmark birthday.

But she will be writing to record numbers each year as the number of people who are expected to survive until 100 is set to balloon.

A baby boy born in 1952 was expected to live to the age of 78. A baby boy born today is expected to live to 91, with around 32 per cent reaching 100.

Meanwhile, a baby girl is living for 11 years longer than in 1952, with life expectancy at birth rising from 83 to 94.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) £15.9 million

Life expectancy (boy) 78

Life expectancy (girl) 83

People aged 100 and over 300

% of pensioners in population 14

Employment (men) 400,000 in metalworking, engineering and electrical trades

Employment (women) 370,000 domestic servants and 215,000 charwomen or office cleaners

GDP £1.5 billion

Life expectancy (boy) 91

Life expectancy (girl) 94

People aged 100 and over 13420

% of pensioners in population 20

Employment (men) 600,000 as shop managers or assistants or in sales

Employment (women) 384,000 domestic cleaners and 446,000 care home assistants or home carers

Soaring life expectancy means pensioners make up one in five of the population, compared to only one in seven – or 14 per cent – in 1952.

Experts warn children may live to 100, but they will not get their State pension until they are ‘70 or beyond’.

The State pension age is already rising to 66 for both men and women by 2020, rising again to 67 in 2028 and will continue to rise as life expectancy increases.
