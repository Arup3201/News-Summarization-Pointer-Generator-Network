A mother-of-two who was told the operations and chemotherapy treatment she endured to rid her of bowel cancer would leave her infertile has defied medics by giving birth to a miracle baby girl.

Beth Bryant, 43, underwent numerous operations and intensive chemotherapy after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2008.

But while the treatment saved her life, doctors warned the mortgage adviser that she and her partner Matt Hinton- who live in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, with her sons Tony Bryant, 14, and Dean Bryant, 12 - would not be able to have any more children. And then baby Evane arrived out of the blue.

Beth said: 'Doctors did offer me a drug to try to give me a 50-50 chance of conceiving. I already had two healthy boys and I felt I had enough to contend with, so I declined that.'

But after finishing the gruelling cancer treatment, Beth and Matt were shocked to discover she was pregnant again.

She said: 'The last thing I was expecting was to fall pregnant. I just couldn't believe it. Matt was stunned by thrilled.

'At first I just carried on as normal and I didn't go to the doctors for a while because I was in denial. Saying it out loud felt like I was like I was tempting fate.

'I don't think anyone could believe it, especially my mum and my close family because they knew what I had been through and how there was no way I was supposed to get pregnant.

'I doubted my body was capable and of course the midwives kept a very close eye on me but we made it.'

Talking about baby Evane, Beth said: 'There's not a day that goes by when I don't think how special she is - she's our little miracle.

'We are a really close family and the boys idolize her. They can't wait to get home from school and give her a cuddle.'

Evane, now one, was born at the Princess Royal Hospital near Beth's home in Haywards Heath in May last year.

Beth, who was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the large bowel, is now raising money for Cancer Research UK's Stand Up to Cancer Campaign.

She added: 'It's thanks to research I am still here and we have Evane. I am so grateful for the treatment which saved my life. Sadly, however, not everyone survives.'

Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK and around 11,500 people are diagnosed each year.
