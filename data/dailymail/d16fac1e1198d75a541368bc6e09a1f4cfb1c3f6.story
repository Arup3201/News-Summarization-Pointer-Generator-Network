Miners' leader Arthur Scargill was accused of hypocrisy last night after it emerged he tried to buy his London council flat by exploiting one of Margaret Thatcher’s flagship policies.

The former National Union of Mineworkers president applied for the £1million property at a knock-down price in 1993 under the Right To Buy scheme.

But the Left-winger was turned down because the Barbican flat was not his primary residence.

Former miners' union boss Arthur Scargill faces criticism over the revelation that he tried to use the flagship Right to Buy laws of his bitter rival

Mr Scargill, who led the doomed 
miners’ strike against the Thatcher government’s pit closures in 1984, 
failed to mention in the paperwork that he did not pay the rent – the 
NUM paid £34,000 a year to the Corporation of London for it.

The
 revelations, in a BBC1 Inside Out documentary, follow a court case last
 year in which the 76-year-old firebrand lost the right to stay in the 
flat for life at the union’s expense.

During the hearing it emerged that from 1991 to 2008 the NUM’s executive committee did not know it was paying the rent.

Mr Scargill, who has been shunned by many former allies as a result of 
the legal battle over his perks, told the BBC that had he succeeded in 
buying the council flat – at a potential discount of up to 50 per cent –
 he would have transferred its ownership to the union.

But
 NUM general secretary Chris Kitchen rejected this explanation. He said 
he was shocked by Mr Scargill’s attempt to ‘feather his nest’ and said 
that members had been betrayed by their former leader.

‘I
 can’t believe that the man I now know as Arthur Scargill would have 
given away a million-pound flat,’ he said, adding that Mr Scargill had 
misled the union into paying for the flat in the first place and had no 
right to it in his contract.

The embarrassing revelation emerged in legal papers relating to the court battle last year which saw Mr Scargill lose the right to live rent free in the flat in Barbican's Shakespeare Tower

Tory
 Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said of the revelations: ‘The 
revolution may be complete if Arthur Scargill wants to take up the Right
 To Buy.’

The bitter dispute between the Conservative government and the miners was triggered in March 1984 by plans to close 20 loss-making pits.

Mr Scargill went into battle with the Tories and a year-long war of attrition ensued. 

This month it emerged Mrs Thatcher planned to mobilise hundreds of troops and considered declaring a state of emergency at the height of the 1984 strike.

Another option was to switch to a three-day working week after ministers warned her that the lights could go out in Britain, according to the National Archives.

A secret plan was hatched by the Thatcher government to stop union leaders smuggling suitcases of Soviet cash in Britain.

But it has now emerged that Mr Scargill tried to takje advantage of one of the flagship policies of his old foe.

Right to Buy, introduced in 1980, was at first criticised for reducing housing stock but it allowed millions to own a home for the first time and increased social mobility.

It allowed tenants to buy a council-owned property with a discount of up to 50 per cent on its market value.

Mr Scargill's application emerged in legal papers relating to last year’s court case in which Mr Scargill lost the right to stay in his London flat for life at the expense of the NUM.

NUM general secretary Chris Kitchen told the BBC: ‘The fact that Scargill tried to use Thatcher's right-to-buy scheme is bad enough, but there is no evidence it would have been signed over to the NUM for the benefit of the members.’

Former Scargill loyalist Jimmy Kelly, a miner at the Edlington Main pit near Doncaster in the 1980s, added: ‘It's so hypocritical it's unreal. It was Thatcher's legislation, actually giving council tenants the right to buy their own houses.

‘I think if it had been made public before then there'd have been a huge outcry. I think people would be astounded by knowing that.’

When Baroness Thatcher dies last year, Mr Scargill did not comment publicly.

But it emerged he expressed his delight via text message. Ken Capstick, treasurer of the Socialist Labour Party which Arthur Scargill leads, sent the former union boss a text message on Monday reading: ‘Thatcher Dead’.

Mr Scargill replied almost instantly: ‘Scargill Alive!’
