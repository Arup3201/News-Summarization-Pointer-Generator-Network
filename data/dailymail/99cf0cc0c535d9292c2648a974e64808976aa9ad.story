A father-of-three was shamed into taking drastic action over his weight after humiliating day out with his children at Legoland. 

Pete Cavender was riding the log flume when his 23-stone bulk weighed down the ride so heavily that it wouldn't move in the fast-moving water.

While his friends couldn't help but laugh, Pete, 37, was forced to stand up and shunt the log along the sides of the slide to get to the end of the ride.

Dramatic transformation: After getting stuck on the log flume, Pete Cavender, 37, lost an impressive eight stone

And while the former engineer tried to laugh too, it a serious wake-up call - if he didn't lose weight fast he would be in serious trouble.

He said: 'The log just got stuck. It was supposed to get rushed along by all the fast-moving water but it just got jammed, largely because of my weight.

'Everyone was watching us and having a giggle and, to hide my embarrassment, I joined in with the joke.

'But deep down I was mortified, particularly as all my daughters were there.

Sleeping off lunch: Before Pete lost weight, he'd happily feast on large portions of fast food

'We had no choice but to push the log along just to get off the ride. I couldn’t wait to get off.'

Pete, from Maidstone, Kent, had been over-eating for years and would think nothing of gorging on a 10-piece family bucket at KFC.

His weight had ballooned as he travelled around the south-east in his job as an engineer.

'I was in my van a lot and I would just live off snacks from bakeries, McDonalds and my beloved KFC,' he said.

'I had played a lot of sport - rugby and cricket in particular - but gradually I became more susceptible to injuries as my weight shot up.

'In the end, the only trousers I had in my wardrobe were jogging bottoms - because I knew the waists would stretch.

'I had a 48-inch waist and I knew that if I didn't lose weight and radically change my lifestyle I was going to run into serious health problems.'

The scene of the crime: Pete and his friends ride the log flume where he later got stuck

After getting wedged, Pete realised it was time to do something about his 48-inch waist

Pete started exercising again regularly - swimming a mile at a time because a session in the pool put less strain on his joints than other sports. And he began to count every calorie he ate using an app on his phone.

'I relished my new lifestyle. I started making my own bread - instead of using sugar I would use sweetener.

'A typical slice of bread has more than 120 calories - mine had around 55. The weight began to fall off me.'

He also took Forza Raspberry Ketone diet pills - first made popular by Kim Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey.

They are said to work by suppressing the appetite and giving users an energy rush through caffeine which increases resting metabolism - allowing users to burn more calories even when they are not exercising.

Pete said: 'I work as engineer - I like to know how things work. I took the same attitude to my weight loss - looking at all the factors which had caused my weight to balloon.

'I knew that I needed to change my diet and start a regular regime of exercise.

Then and now: Thanks to ditching his beloved fast food and a new fitness regime the weight fell off Pete

'The diet pills were also a really 
important step. They worked for me in the same way patches work for a 
smoker who is looking to give up.

'They gave me that extra impetus I needed.They helped me to stop wanting food.

'Some people say that using diet pills is cheating.

'They don't just work on their own: you need to combine them with a good diet and regular exercise

'I soon found that I was full up eating half what I had done before.

He lost three stone in the first three months and has shed eight stone since that fateful day at Legoland.

His weight has gone down from 23 stone to under 15 stone and he has around two stone to go reach what he feels will be his ideal weight.

Pete's weight loss has helped him transformed his life and allowed him to cuddle his daughters again for the first time in years.

He said: 'They tell me now, "Dad, we can get our arms around you again."'

They are looking forward to going back to Legoland this summer.

'I’ll go straight back to the log flume,' he explained. 'And this time I won’t get stuck.'
