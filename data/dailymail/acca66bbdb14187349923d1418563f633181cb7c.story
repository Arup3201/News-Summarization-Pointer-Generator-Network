Jailed: Jack Smith has been sentenced to 21 years in prison for attacking a stranger with a meat cleaver

A violent thug who attacked a stranger with a meat cleaver in the street on New Year's Eve has been jailed for 21 years.

Jack Smith managed to escape justice for more than five years after leaving Matthew Jeeves for dead following the unprovoked assault.

But when DNA tests were carried out on a hat left at the scene of the attack in Cheam, Surrey, they proved that Smith was responsible.

The 23-year-old from Morden in South London was sentenced to prison at Croydon Crown Court last Friday.

Smith and an accomplice, Barry Hughes, set upon Mr Jeeves as he was walking home from a New Year's Eve party in the early hours of January 1, 2008.

They demanded his mobile phone and money, before Hughes punched him in the face and knocked him to the ground.

Smith and Hughes then hacked at their victim's head with a meat cleaver, leaving him with serious injuries.

Mr Jeeves was eventually found by an off-duty police officer, and underwent multiple operations to reconstruct his face.

He needed more than 100 stitches, and now has a scar running from above his right eye to his chin.

Smith, aged just 17 at the time, was soon arrested but released due to a lack of evidence.

However, the discovery of a hat at the crime scene allowed police to match his DNA.

Earlier this year, he stabbed another man in a bar because he was looking at him, and also stabbed a woman in the ensuing mel√©e.

Last month he pleaded guilty to three counts of wounding with intent, one count of robbery and three firearms offences.

During sentencing on Friday, judge Jeremy Gold QC told Smith: 'You no doubt thought you had got away with it, but you hadn't. This was a quite appalling attack in which the gratuitous violence far exceeded that needed to carry out a robbery.

'One of the blows pierced the victim's skull and you left him for dead. You have shown a casual approach to excessive violence and a complete disregard to the harm you cause.'

Speaking outside court, Detective Inspector John McQuade, who was leading the investigation, branded the two men 'scum'.

He said: 'Jack Smith is dangerous and the streets are safer without him. He was a menace to society. It's been a long time, but I'm glad we got a result for Matthew.'

Mr Jeeves said: 'It's been a difficult five years, but I've got on with my life. I wasn't going to let them win. I'm just glad they cannot hurt anyone else.'

Hughes is currently serving a 13-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to the attack last year.
