A mother who faced the devastation of losing four babies in two years claims a 'mistake' by hospital staff 'damaged her womb'.

Leanne Bilon, 30, said she has been warned she may never have another child.

She and her husband Yane are today demanding answers from Croydon University Hospital, claiming a 'botched' delivery at its maternity ward triggered the tragic sequence of events.

Mrs Bilon has accused the hospital of depriving her of precious moments with one of her sons, who midwives allegedly said had died hours before he actually did.

A health watchdog is investigating the alleged failings, which Mrs Bilon, of Thornton Heath, south London, said have left her terrified of going to hospital.

Leanne Bilon, 30, from Thornton Heath, has lost four babies in the last two years. The mother-of-three claims a mistake made by staff at Croydon University Hospital caused the tragedy

The 30-year-old is mother to two sons and a daughter, who were all born healthy.

She was due to give birth to a third son, due to be called Eli, in 2012.

On September 24, at almost 25 weeks' pregnant, Mrs Bilon experienced contractions and was taken to the hospital by ambulance.

She claims nurses wrongly told her she was fully dilated and instructed her to begin pushing.

Mrs Bilon said realising their mistake, staff then rushed her for an emergency Caesarean section to deliver the baby, but it was deemed too dangerous.

'I was wheeled back to delivery and left in the room alone while my baby died inside me,' she said.

'My baby was stillborn just hours later.'

Mrs Bilon claims she was initially given no warning from hospital staff that pushing when not fully dilated could have damaged her cervix, and reduced her chances of giving birth safely.

Then a year later, in 2013, she miscarried while she was 18 weeks' pregnant with twin girls.

In January tragedy struck the couple for a fourth time, when they lost a second baby boy, Shay.

In 2012, Mrs Bilon's baby boy Eli was stillborn. She then miscarried twin girls in 2013 and in January, a second baby boy, Shay, was born at 22 weeks but didn't survive

He was born 'gasping for breath' at just 22 weeks on January 19.  

'I was told that even though his heart was beating it was just a flutter - he wasn't really alive,' said Mrs Bilon.

'So I said my goodbyes and they took him out of the room. They came back in the room at 3.15pm telling me my baby had just died.

'I couldn't believe it. I was disgusted that they led me to believe all that time that my son was dead. 

'I would have stayed with him and held him on my chest.'

Mrs Bilon has since been told she has at best a 40 per cent chance of giving birth successfully, forcing her to abandon hopes of another child with her husband.

The couple, who have been married for four years, have lodged complaints against the hospital and its staff with the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the Parliamentary and Health Services Ombudsman, which are all investigating. 

A spokesperson for Croydon Health Services NHS Trust said: 'This is incredibly sad, and we have given our unreserved condolences to Mrs Bilon for the loss of her babies.

'We have thoroughly reviewed our care and sadly have not found anything that would have altered the outcome. 

'We have shared all the findings of our investigations with Mrs Bilon, who we are continuing to try and support as best we can.' 

Zoe Packman, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professionals, added: 'I would like to again express the Trust's sincere condolences to Mrs Bilon.

'Our maternity services have been transformed over recent years. In discussion with Mrs Bilon we want to make sure every lesson is learned to keep improving our care.'
