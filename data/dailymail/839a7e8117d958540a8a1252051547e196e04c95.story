These mythical hybrid creatures look uncannily real thanks to a man and his Photoshop skills.

Norwegian student Arne Olav has been playing Frankenstein, morphing together images of different, ordinary animals to create with some hilarious hybrid creatures.

From the wacky 'guinea lion' through to the 'platyporse' and 'pengwhale', these playful creations have gained a cult following online.

Neigh way! Norwegian student has gained a cult following online for his pictures of weird and wacky creatures made from photos of two ordinary animals morphed together such as this 'shorse'

The 24-year-old said: ‘I try to think of unique-looking animals so that the hybrid will be memorable.

‘Take for example beluga whales, pugs and proboscis monkeys. They look nothing like any other animal so I thought that they'd make for fun subjects for animal hybrids. 

Better than study: The 24-year-old student started experimenting with the pictures as a distraction from study during exam time, creating hybrid creatures such as this 'purilla'

Pug attack: This pug dog looks oddly at home with a shark's body in this strange hybrid combination

Cute and cuddly? Olav first started the craze with this image after feeling inspired by a picture of his friend's guinea pigs

A galloping 'snorse': Olav's pictures became popular among his friends and family and now are found all over the internet

‘I've also gone the other way by 
choosing horse as a base and trying lots of different animal heads on 
horses to see what it would look.’

Mr Olav started experimenting with the pictures last year and take him just 30 minutes to create.

The electronic engineering student first started creating the pictures as a distraction from a hectic exam period, gaining inspiration from his friend’s guinea pigs.

Double take: Olav said he's been getting some great reactions from family and friends to his pictures

Be afraid, be very afraid: This 'spider pig' looks uncannily real but don't be fooled by the artist's master Photoshop skills

A quack or a neigh? Olav is enjoying the attention from family and friends but says his six-year-old nephew will have to wait a few years before he teaches him how to make creatures such as this 'huck'

Mr Olav said: ‘A friend of mine has two 
guinea pigs and we used to joke about how silly they are, being totally 
harmless and non-intimidating.

‘So, when I wanted breaks from reading 
to the exams, I began to Photoshop guinea pig heads onto other animals, 
to make them look even weirder.

‘I think the Guinea Lion is the first animal hybrid I made.’

Since then, the student has gone from strength to strength and his Photoshop skills are the envy of all his friends and family.

He said: ‘I've had great reactions from both family and friends for my animal hybrids.

'People think the pictures are funny, and for that I'm grateful. 

‘My six-year-old nephew begs me to teach him how to make them, but he's got to wait a few years first.’

The photos are as wacky and weird as Sharknado, a film about a freak tornado filled with human-eating sharks which terrorises Los Angeles.

Wacky hybrids: Olav takes two ordinary animals and uses Photoshop to morph them together to 'make some memorable' like this 'probiscird'

Quick study fix: The pictures take Olav just 30 minutes to create
