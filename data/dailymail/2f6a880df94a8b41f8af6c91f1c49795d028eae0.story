With half-term almost upon us, there is good news for families planning an autumn break.

The pound is up against the majority of the major currencies compared to this time last year, which could mean that little bit extra luxury this autumn season.

The strength of sterling means holidaymakers jetting off to the sun could get up to 13 per cent more money than October 2013.

Travel money expert International Currency Exchange compared rates this October versus October last year and found the biggest difference to be Turkish lira, with families getting more than 195 extra lira on a £500 exchange.

The pound against the euro has reached a two-year high in the past few weeks and now offers over 6.5 per cent more euros compared to this time last year, boosting spending power in popular autumn destinations like Portugal, Malta and the Canaries.

Consider choosing a destination where your currency is strong versus the local currency. When you are away you'll receive better value on food, drinks and holiday activities.

Booking a flight and accommodation together as a package can provide a saving. 

Book travel insurance before you leave to avoid the pitfalls of large bills and having to replace the contents of your suitcase if the worst was to happen.

Book activities such as tours and excursions before you leave, saving time when you reach your destination.

When booking late night or early morning travel consider the additional costs that may be incurred such as taxi fares or airport parking. If you are parking at the airport, shop around for the best deals. 

Book medical insurance before you leave to avoid potentially expensive medical bills if you fall sick or get injured. For those travelling in Europe you can get a European Health Insurance card  which you can apply for online. It's free to apply and it can mean that the cost of medical treatment is significantly reduced or even free.

Check if an in-flight meal is included and weigh up the costs of saving a few pounds on your flight vs. the amount you'll actually spend at the airport or in-flight on food.

Consider all the extras when booking a hotel. A hotel might seem cheaper at first, but if you consider the cost of Wi-Fi and meals you may find you're not really saving at all – and may even end up paying more!

Those planning a holiday to North America for the fall could also be 'quids in'.

Sterling has strengthened by more than seven per cent against the Canadian dollar.

Parents forking out for theme parks and attractions in the US will find it a little more affordable than last October with rates now comparable to 2012.

Koko Sarkari, head of International Currency Exchange, said: 'The pound is providing good value against a range of currencies right now, particularly the euro, offering over 38 more euros on a £500 compared to last October.' 

David Swann from Travelex added: 'The Pound's value has sunk slightly from its inflated position a few months ago but British holidaymakers will still get more from their holiday budgets compared to this time last year.

'Whether heading on a short getaway, or farther flung destinations there are some considerable savings to be made.'

Expedia.co.uk managing director Andy Washington said: 'Families looking to book a holiday this half term can really benefit from the strong pound we are seeing this year. 

'At the current exchange rate, for every £10 spent, holidaymakers receive a further 80 pence for their money in Europe, compared to this time last year. 

'This puts British holidaymakers in a great position when booking European travel, giving them better value for money on hotel bookings and Euro currency before a trip. 

'Visiting destinations where the pound is strong is a great way to save money and make it go further on your holiday.'

London Gatwick Airport has released its forecast figures and destinations ahead of one of the busiest breaks in the school calendar. Around one million passengers will fly through Gatwick between Friday, October 24 and Sunday, November 2, with more than 509,000 expected to depart.

Meanwhile, Tenerife in the Canary Islands is 2014's third favourite, followed by the Dutch capital Amsterdam in fourth. Orlando, Florida – home to popular family attractions such as Disneyland and Universal Studios – remains a firm favourite this year in fifth place.

Nick Pope, Operations Manager at London Gatwick, said: 'This has been a record year for passenger numbers at Gatwick and this October is no exception. Gatwick is ready to welcome more than one million passengers and we're expecting this October half term to be one of our busiest yet.'

A seven-night stay at the 5* Hotel Venus Beach, Cyprus, departing from London Gatwick on October 26, all inclusive was £1,253 per person at this time last year. Now it comes in at £877pp, a saving of £376pp.

And a seven-night stay at the 4* Hotel Cala Gran - Costa del Sur, departing from Gatwick on October 26, all Inclusive was £775 last October, now it is £581pp, a saving of £194.

And these cost savings aren't limited to Europe. A seven-night stay at the 4* Pensione Hotel, room only, departing from London Heathrow on October 26, was £1,121pp last October, and is now £995pp, saving £126pp. 

A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: 'Demand for holidays this half term has been incredibly high, and while there might be a few deals still available for anyone who's left it late to book, these are few and far between. 

'Savvy consumers booked their half term breaks early, realising that holidays to popular destinations on the continent aren't as expensive as they might think. 

'The Canary Islands, famed for year-round sunshine, their fantastic family offering and exceptional value for money, are proving particularly popular. However, it's not just Europe that offers great value – this half term, we've seen non-Euro Zone favourites such as Egypt and Turkey very much in demand.'
