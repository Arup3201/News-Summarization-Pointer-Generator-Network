Unions declared war on ministers today after George Osborne gave schools the power to reward better teachers with higher pay.

The Chancellor said heads should be able to pay teachers more if they perform better in the job than colleagues.

But NASUWT, the largest teaching union, branded the proposals as 'unfair' – and said the major unions would be meeting in the next few days to consider their response.

Mr Osborne said national pay bargaining for civil servants, prison officers and NHS staff will continue – meaning staff will all continue to be paid the same.

But he told MPs that there will be greater flexibility for headteachers – giving them more ability to pay good staff more.

He also announced in his Autumn Statement speech that there will be £1billion more money to expand good schools and build 100 more.

And he confirmed that education will be the only department, along with the NHS, which will not suffer further cuts.

At the moment, teachers get a blanket rise set by Whitehall.

Heads only have the discretion to award good teachers better pay if they are on the upper pay scale.

For most teachers, the assumption is 
that they will get the Whitehall-sanctioned rise only if the head makes a
very strong case against.

Under Mr Osborne’s changes, headteachers will be given almost complete freedom to vary pay rates across all pay grades.

Academies and free schools already have this complete discretion.

Mr Osborne has in the past raised the 
possibility of scrapping national pay bargaining for public sector staff
– a plan condemned by the unions and also his Lib Dem coalition 
partners.

This would mean 
that people would be able to be paid less in regions where it is cheaper
to live, and where the local private sector pays less.

The Chancellor asked official pay review bodies to consider the plans for regional pay bargaining, or 'market-facing pay' as he prefers to call it.

He has accepted their advice that national pay arrangements will be continued in the NHS and Prison Service, and also for civil servants.

But Mr Osborne said there would be changes for teachers.

He said: 'The School Teachers' Review body does recommend much greater freedom to individual schools to set pay in line with performance.

'My right honourable friend the Education Secretary [Michael Gove] will set out how this will be implemented.'

The announcement will be hugely unpopular with the unions and could spark yet more industrial action in England's schools.

However, the Chancellor appears to have dropped plans for regional pay bargaining for schools – meaning that a teacher in the north east will not be paid less than one in the south east.

Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT, said: 'The war on teachers waged by the Coalition government continues.

'These proposals place virtually unlimited discretion on teachers' pay in the hands of headteachers at a time when unfairness and discrimination are already rife.

'The dismantling of the national pay framework is going to be bad for children's education and bad for the teaching profession.'

He added: 'The NASUWT and the NUT, representing 9 out of 10 teachers, will be meeting in the next few days to consider our response to this very serious development which is at the heart of our trade dispute with the Secretary of State.'

Mr Osborne said that while most government departments will have to shoulder greater cuts, the schools budget will be exempted, along with the NHS.

These spending cuts to raise money for building projects, including more money for the construction of 100 new schools and academies.

He said: 'Since improving our education system is the best investment in a competitive economy, I am today committing £270million to fund improvements in further education colleges and £1billion to expand good schools and build 100 new free schools and academies.'

The Chancellor commended Michael Gove's Department for Education for making more savings in bureaucracy than other departments, allowing lots more money to be re-diverted to the front line.

'If all departments reduced their spending on administration in line with the best-performing departments like Education and Communities and Local Government, then another £1billion could be saved,' he said.

Mr Osborne said that while departmental resource budgets would be reduced by 1 per cent next year and 2 per cent the year after, education and health would be exempted.

'We will continue to seek efficiency savings in the NHS and in our schools, but that money will be recycled to protect spending in these priority areas,' he said.

Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, said: 'Teachers are to be singled out, selected to become the guinea pigs in the Chancellor's ill-advised public sector pay experiment.

'Today the government has given the green light to all schools to set the salaries of their teachers. This is a harsh decision – teachers are already suffering financial hardship having endured a lengthy pay freeze.

'Now schools will be able to choose how to pay individual staff according to notoriously unreliable measurements of “performance”.

'This kind of individualised pay will lead to division within staff rooms as teacher is set against teacher. Parents and pupils will suffer too as valuable time and resources are wasted on this divisive approach.'
