The former Gunner has hit back, dismissing those claims as ‘bitter’ and ‘jealousy’, insisting his move is for a ‘human experience’, to help discover a new culture.

‘I always remember what the old boys and coaches used to say when I was young: as long as you can play, keep playing, ‘cos you’ll miss it when it’s over,’ Pires told RMC Sport TV.

'I’m still in good shape so I’m ready for it. Sure, I’ll be earning money, but that’s part and parcel of the world of football.’

Pires will be joined in the Indian Premier League by former teammate Freddie Ljungberg, as well as several other legends including former Juventus pair David Trezeguet and Alessandro Del Piero.

The midfielder played over 200 games for Arsenal and was a double Premier League player of the year
