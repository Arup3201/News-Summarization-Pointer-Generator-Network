Liverpool are seriously considering a January move for Fernando Torres.

However, they could face competition from Atletico Madrid, the club where the Spaniard started his career.

Torres is currently on a two-year loan from Chelsea to AC Milan, but it has been widely reported in Italy that the Serie A side want to end the deal due to the striker’s lack of form and goals. He has scored just once in 10 games.

Liverpool would consider bringing Fernando Torres back to Anfield if AC Milan cut short his loan deal

Mario Balotelli has yet to score a Premier League goal for the Reds and could be moved out on loan

Given the injury problems Diego Costa has suffered Jose Mourinho might consider taking Torres back to add depth to his squad. But that would seem unlikely.

Liverpool, who seem to be giving up on the gamble that saw them sign Mario Balotelli for £16million from Milan last summer, need to bolster their strike force.

And Torres, who was outstanding for the Reds (65 goals in 102 Premier League games) before being sold to Chelsea for £50million in 2010 could fit the bill.

Liverpool may take the 30-year-old on loan with a view to a permanent move.

Meanwhile, Balotelli could be moved on loan to Napoli in Janaury.

Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock has made it clear he wants to bolster his strike force.

West Ham’s Carlton Cole is a possibility and so is Watford poacher Troy Deeney.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp believes striker Charlie Austin will sign a new £60,000-a-week contract ahead of the transfer window.

Newcastle have been considering a move for the in-form striker.

Winston Reid also wants £60,000 a week to commit his future to West Ham. The defender is out of contract in the summer.

Last week Hammers boss Sam Allardyce said it would take an offer of £20m to prise Reid away in January.

That’s a rather optimistic evaluation. Liverpool and Arsenal remain interested.

So far the West Ham board have offered Reid a new deal in the region of £45,000 a week. But if they raise it by around £15,000 the New Zealand international is likely to sign.

World Cup final official Howard Webb, now technical advisor to the Premier League referees, has been in Holland to assess a trial of using in-game TV replays.

Former England and Spurs player Gary Mabbutt has become an ambassador for IPRO, the new sports drink company who sponsor Derby and now supply many Championship clubs. 

Their 'health drink rivals' include Gatorade, Powerade and Lucozade.

I AM HEARING 

West Ham will still not be rushed into talks with Sam Allardyce over a new contract.

In turn, Allardyce, whose contract expires in the summer, has not been banging on the chairman’s door. 

Even if the club finish the season in the form they have shown so far there could still be a parting of ways in the summer.

I AM ALSO HEARING 

As it stands Ally McCoist will work out his notice with Rangers over the next 12 months.

But if the situation becomes impossible and there is parting of ways former England, Ipswich and Rangers legend Terry Butcher could be in line for the Rangers hot seat.

Last season Liverpool crushed Arsenal 5-1.

Can’t see that happening again. And should Arsenal win (6-4 with Coral) the pressure on Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers really will intensify.

As it stands Rodgers is the third most likely PL boss to be axed at 5-1 behind West Brom’s Alan Irvine (11-10) and Leicester’s Nigel Pearson (11-4).

BTW 

Raheem Sterling was 20 last week.

Ahead of Sunday’s game against Arsenal he has made 75 appearances for Liverpool and scored 14 goals since his debut in 2012.

He has made 13 appearances for England but hasn’t scored. He has played at World Cup finals.

He is an exciting talent. He could even become a world-class player. But in the grand scheme of things his top-level career is still in its infancy.

Nevertheless, Liverpool are keen to secure his services have offered him another new deal worth £70,000 a week. It seems right on the money in terms of the Premier League wage band due to Sterling’s age, experience and achievement.

Raheem Sterling is a superb talent and has already played 75 times for Liverpool

Sterling has potential but has a long way to go before hitting the level of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi

But Sterling, or perhaps more to the point his advisers, have thus far turned it down.

It is understood the Sterling camp want more than £100,000. And suddenly there are stories leaking out that Real Madrid or Bayern Munich want him.

It has become a poker game.

I understand players wanting to get the best deal they can. But before you can expect to pick up the wages of ‘platinum players’, prove you really are one over a period of time.

At this stage of his career Sterling’s focus should on making the step up to the next level, where he would be doing it week in week out like the Ronaldo’s or Messi’s of this world, not haggling over more money. 

Sterling's camp should not be haggling over more money at Liverpool with him at such a young age

I SAY 

It’s boring and often embarrassing when managers use most of their ‘air time’ at post-match TV interviews to complain about referees.

Usually it’s a device after a defeat to offer sufficient soundbites to divert attention from the other reasons why the team lost.

It’s easy to ridicule referees who don’t have a right of reply.

And once the manager has set the agenda, the fans and often naive headline writers do the rest.

Sometimes when managers go a bit too far in the criticism they get fined.

You get the impression, though, that managers think the fine is worth paying if it deflects criticism from them.

Refereeing decisions have been criticised this season but the stats prove they're at the top of their game

Of course referees and linesman make mistakes. Occasionally howlers. And yes there are times when a bad big call on a foul, offside or a red card changes the course of a game.

But it’s all too easy to slaughter officials after the countless replays.

And consider this statistic: Ahead of this Saturday’s Premier League fixtures there had been, collectively, 38,718 decision moments for referees. Of those, according to the analysis of match evaluators, 98.4 per cent have been made correctly.

It’s often said that all managers and players want from referees is consistency. Well according to those figures that’s exactly what they are getting.
