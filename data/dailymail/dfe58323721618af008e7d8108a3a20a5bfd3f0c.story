Threat: The head of the PCC gang Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho is serving a life sentence for the murder of a judge in 2003

Brazil's biggest drug cartel has promised a 'World Cup of terror' next year - in a reminder of the high level of violence that still marks the country.

The threat was issued by the First Capital Command in Sao Paulo, who last year was behind the murder of more than a hundred of the city's police officers.

And last night violent demonstrations exploded on the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo with protesters setting fire to cars and fighting pitched battles with police.

The protests were in support of a 
teachers' strike and were the latest in a long line of unrest that has 
seen millions take to the streets in Brazil to protest against the 
government.

Both will be a 
sobering reminder amid the euphoria of England's fans that next year 
they will be travelling to a country where safety and stability cannot 
be guaranteed.

Six matches 
in next year's competition, including the opening game, will be held at 
the Arena de Sao Paulo while seven, including the final, will be held in
 Rio de Janeiro's Estadio do Maracana.

In
 messages intercepted by police this week, leaders of the gang in Sao 
Paulo made the vague but ominous threat should the authorities move 
jailed members of the cartel to a tougher prison.

In Brazil, powerful gangs often linked
 to the drug trade are very powerful and frequently control whole 
prisons and favelas, or shanty towns.

Enraged: Efforts to transfer high-ranking imprisoned members of the gang, known by its Portuguese initials PCC  enraged the gang in 2006 (file photo)

Since 2002, the PCC has been led by Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho, known as Marcola, or 'Playboy.' He is serving a life sentence for the murder of a judge in 2003

The
 gang have nicknames including Wander Eduardo 'Fat Face' Ferrari, Isaias
 'Weird' Moreira do Nascimento and Antonio 'Ugly Beast' Carlos dos 
Santos.

During 2012, a war broke out between the gang and Sao Paulo's Military Police.

They
 felt the government had violated an informal agreement, long denied by 
officials, to slow the prison transfers of gang leaders and limit 
crackdowns on its operations on Sao Paulo's outskirts in exchange for an
 end to gang violence.Â 

Threat: Brazil's biggest drug cartel has promised a 'World Cup of terror' next year - in a reminder of the high level of violence that still marks the country

Battle: Last night violent demonstrations exploded on the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo with protesters setting fire to cars and fighting pitched battles with police

Anger: The protests across Brazil last night were in support of a teachers' strike

Tension: The protests were the latest in a long line of unrest that has seen millions take to the streets in Brazil to protest against the government

The gang ordered attacks on police, 106 officers - many off-duty - were killed.

In the protests in Rio de Janeiro, a group of masked youths attacked shops, set fire to a police car and threw petrol bombs.

In Sao Paulo shops were ransacked.

Police responded with tear gas, pepper spray and sound bombs.

Efforts
 to transfer high-ranking imprisoned members of the gang, known by its 
Portuguese initials PCC, to far off prisons where they would have 
difficulty giving orders by cellphone to their soldiers on the outside 
enraged the gang in 2006.

Demands: Protesters oppose a pay proposal by the city's mayor, saying it doesn't go far enough in addressing their demands, according to published reports

Five
 days of gang-inspired attacks then left at least 175 dead, including 
police officers, traffickers and the innocent in between. After the 
violence lingered for months, an alleged informal truce between the 
government and the PCC slowed the transfers and the attacks tapered off.

The
 gang was founded in 1993 by hardened criminals inside Sao Paulo's 
Taubate Penitentiary, but remained a relatively obscure group until 
early 2001, when uprisings in 29 prisons across the state killed 19 
inmates. It was the biggest prison rebellion in Brazil's recent history 
and took police 27 hours to crush.

The PCC was formed to pressure for improved prison conditions.

Brazilian
 Justice Minister Jose Cardozo, speaking at a security conference last 
year, said he would 'prefer to die' than serve time in his nation's 
prisons.

He added: 'We have a medieval penal system.'

While the gang's start may have been rooted in fighting for basic human rights of the imprisoned, its members quickly began using their power inside prisons to direct drug-dealing and extortion operations on the outside.

'The PCC is better organized, more powerful, and they have a monopoly of crimes and power which is something nobody achieved in Rio,' said Ignacio Cano, a researcher at the Violence Analysis Center at Rio de Janeiro State University. 'They are by far the strongest criminal group in Brazil.'

There are no official numbers on the gang's size, but the inner core considered as members is thought to include no more than a few thousand people, Cano said.

Police documents obtained by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo last year indicated the gang's members numbered just over 1,300, and showed they are required to pay $300 in monthly fees in exchange for legal aid if they're arrested and support for their families if they go to jail.

What makes the PCC so powerful is that corporate approach to how it manages gang enterprises as well as its reach beyond its core membership.

'They outsource. They contract people and allow them to carry out certain activities as long as they're paying them (the PCC) something in return,' Cano said. 'For example, in 2006 many people say the killings of policemen were outsourced.'

Estimates of the number of people connected in some way to the gang go as high as 100,000.
