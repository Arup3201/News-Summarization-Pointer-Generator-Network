England and Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes has signed for the Melbourne Renegades in Australia's Big Bash League.

Stokes, 23, will replace injured New Zealand international Jesse Ryder in the Renegades' squad for the remainder of the Twenty20 competition, starting with next Wednesday's game against the Hobart Hurricanes.

'I'm excited about coming down to Melbourne for the second half of the Big Bash season to play for the Renegades,' Stokes told the club's website.

'It was great to see them get their first win on the board last Tuesday and I'm looking forward to the upcoming matches so we can build on that result and hopefully drive the team towards finals success.'

Coach Simon Helmot added: 'Ben is a quality player and was recognised by many as one of the shining lights during England's difficult tour of Australia last year. He brings international experience and a real energy and will be a great asset to both our bowling stocks and batting line up.'
