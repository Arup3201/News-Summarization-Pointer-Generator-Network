Mother: Sally Young, who came across the fatal crash in which her son David died, has been awarded more than £230,000 in damages after a judge ruled she was a 'secondary victim'

A widow who came across a fatal crash she later discovered had claimed the life of her son was yesterday awarded more than £230,000 in damages.

Martha Sarah Young – known as Sally – saw a badly damaged car while making her way to the gym where she was due to meet 26-year-old David.

She later learned that he had been killed when a speeding driver lost control of the car she had seen.

Mrs Young raised an action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, suing the driver who hit the young electrician as he walked on the pavement of Danes Drive, Scotstoun, Glasgow, in June 2010. The judge, Lady Rae, said she was satisfied that child development officer Mrs Young, from Bearsden near Glasgow, was a ‘secondary victim’, entitling her to enhanced compensation.

The sum awarded dwarfs other packages, such as those given by the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. A soldier who loses both arms below the elbow, or both legs below the knee, for example, receives only £172,000.

Mrs Young, whose husband died in the Cormorant Alpha helicopter crash in the North Sea in 1992, was said to have had a very close relationship with her son, whose father had told him to take care of his mother and sister before embarking on his fatal offshore trip.

Mrs Young said of her ‘model son’: ‘He was a very generous man. Anything you asked him to do he would just do for you.’

In 2012, motorist Arthur MacVean, then 63, of Glasgow, was jailed for four and half years at the High Court in Edinburgh after being convicted of causing death by dangerous driving.

Mrs Young had parked and was making her way to the gym when she saw the badly-damaged car.

Lady Rae said in her judgment: ‘Her initial reaction was one of relief that her own children could not be involved as her son did not drive and her daughter was at home.’

It was while she was at the gym that police arrived to tell Mrs White that her son had been involved.

The judge said: ‘At that point she remembers screaming and shouting words such as “I don’t think I can go through this again. I can’t do this”.’

Mrs Young told the court that following her son’s death she was unable to visit places where she used to meet him, including the gym, and had visions of him walking in the street and ‘being hit into the air’.

Lady Rae said that in assessing the damages to be awarded she was entitled to consider that Mrs Young had a particularly close relationship with her son partly due to the untimely loss of her husband.

The judge’s award included £80,000 for loss of society, £30,000 for personal services, £35,000 for pain and suffering, £80,000 for loss of earnings and services and £6,250 for the cost of psychological treatment.

Lady Rae said: ‘I cannot ignore the evidence in the present case of the exceptional and unusual closeness between the pursuer and her son.’

Earlier this month, a boy whose grandfather was killed before he was born was awarded £14,000 for the love and guidance he will never enjoy.

Russell Stuart died in a road accident in Aberdeen five months before the birth of grandson Harry.
