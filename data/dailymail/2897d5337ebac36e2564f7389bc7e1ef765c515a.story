The Dutch royal family visited Argentina - Máxima's home country - for Christmas.

They spent several days over the holiday season in a small village in the south of the country called Villa La Angostura catching up with Maxima's relatives.

Princesses Amalia,  Alexia and Ariane joined their parents  in the South American country, where they also spent the 2012 holiday season.

But last year, they decided to stay in Holland as Willem-Alexander had just been crowned king.

He had opted to issue the December 25 Christmas message from his home to the Dutch people.

It is the third visit to Argentina this year for Maxima, who made an incognito visit last month to see her father who was ill. 

She also travelled back in September to celebrate her mother's birthday.   

Although she now lives in Holland, Maxima's ties to Argentina remain strong. 

She was born in Buenos Aires and schooled in the city of Olivos, going on to study Economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina in 1995.
