Tourists to Churchill, Manitoba, in northern Canada are getting nose-to-nose with fearsome polar bears thanks to a massive hand-built machine that is dubbed a 'cruise liner on wheels'.

Tundra Buggies, which tower 13ft over the Arctic tundra, bring holidaymakers within touching distance of the world's largest land predators. Churchill, Manitoba, a town on the western shore of Hudson Bay that has been nicknamed the Polar Bear Capital of the World.

The area is currently deciding whether to lift restrictions on eco-tourism as it prepares to designate a new polar bear provincial park on Hudson Bay.

There are currently 18 permits for the vehicles and some are concerned that more permits might attract tour operators who would not safely navigate around the animals.

Canada is home to two-thirds of the world's polar bears, but environmental experts say climate change could make the Hudson Bay population extinct within a few decades.

The Tundra Buggies, owned and operated by Frontiers North Adventures, who are working with the charity Polar Bears International researching how to save polar bears from extinction, are capable of hauling a mobile lodge with a length of more than 200ft.

The modular lodges contain a cafe, lounge and sleeping quarters in addition to a large observation deck that allows tourists to get close-up photos of polar bears that are eight feet tall on their hind legs and can weigh 1,500 pounds. 

Frontiers North Adventures spokeswoman Brandi Hayberg said: 'Bears are often interested in the Tundra Buggy and will approach it. Sometimes they will stand on their hind legs and put their paws on the side of the vehicle.

Thousands of tourists flock to Churchill every year to see the bears and spend nights under the Northern Lights

'Depending on the height of the bear, our guests can easily get their faces within a few feet of a polar bear.'

Tour operators bill it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience as the excursions range from a one-off day trip at £250 per person to a fully-catered eight-night stay in the Tundra Buggy lodge, which costs over £6,000.

But visitors are almost guaranteed to have a closer encounter with the polar bears and learn about their lives and conservation efforts.

Polar bears are listed as a threatened species, but the population along the Tundra Buggy's route was last recorded as a stable 1,013.

The buggy was designed and built by Churchill resident Leonard Smith, who sold his business to Frontiers North Adventures, which has Tundra Buggies that can accommodate up to 40 passengers.

Guests are assured that the buggies are perfectly sense as long as they use common sense.

Ms Hayberg said: 'Our Tundra Buggies are too tall for the bears to reach the railing of the observation decks or the bottoms of the windows.

'We are always diligent to tell our guests that feeding the bears or littering on the tundra are strictly forbidden. If a guest broke the rules, the tour would end immediately.'

A study involving Frontiers North Adventures found that only five per cent of the white-furred bears showed any dislike for the buggies.

And despite the hefty price tag Mr Hayberg insists it is a trip worth saving for.

She said: 'We do realise that travel in the north is costly. Not everyone in the world will be able to make the journey.

'But getting the chance to see these incredible creatures in real life and then to learn about their lives and habitat from our guides really does seem to drive home the importance of living sustainably.

'Our hope is at the end of the tour our guests will have been inspired by their experience and will in turn return home with the intention of doing their part to help conserve our environment.'
