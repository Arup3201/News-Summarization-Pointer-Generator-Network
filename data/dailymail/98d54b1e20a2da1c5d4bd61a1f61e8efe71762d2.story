Britain has the most expensive airport parking in the world, costing a staggering £12 to stop at Heathrow for between one and two hours.

The peak-time fee at Heathrow’s Terminal 4 is symptomatic of sky-high prices across the country, with a two hour stay costing £10 at Gatwick and Stansted, and £11 at Luton.

Those figures are in stark contrast to major transport hubs around the world, where short-term parking can be found at New York’s JFK airport for £5.50 – less than half the amount charged at Heathrow - and £6.60 at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle.

The only major international airport that charges close to British prices is Sydney, where a stay of between one and two hours costs £11.

Airports in Greece have emerged as some 
of the cheapest in the world, with a short-term stay at Athens 
International costing only £5.40 for two hours.

Milan is not much more expensive, priced at only £6.60 for short-term parking.

The cost of airport parking in Britain is consistently high however, with Glasgow and Edinburgh ensuring it’s not just the airports in and around London where holidaymakers feel overcharged.

The price of a two-hour stay at the Scottish airports costs £9 and £8.90 respectively.

Speaking to the Mirror, the AA’s Paul Watters attacked prices at Heathrow, saying: ‘Drivers will feel they are being fleeced... They don’t want the stress of big parking charges when they are worrying about getting people to the airport on time.’

Heathrow’s record-breaking peak-time 
prices come after a hike in September which airport bosses explained as 
an attempt to ease traffic problems around Terminal 4.

The rise also saw the cost of a 24-stay at the airport rise to an eye-watering £53.90.

Expensive: Even a five minute stop at Heathrow costs a hefty £3. At many airports, including Athens and Berlin, the first 20 minutes of parking are free to allow the picking up and dropping off of passengers

Contrast: British prices are much higher than other major transport hubs, with short-term parking at New York's JFK Airport (pictured) costing £5.50 for two hours - less than half the amount charged at Heathrow

It's not just the overall cost of parking that risks angering British flyers.

At
 many airports, including Athens and Berlin, the first 20 minutes of 
parking are free in order to allow the unhurried picking up and dropping 
off of passengers.

In contrast, even a five minute stop at Heathrow costs a hefty £3.
