NBC's Brian Williams wants you to know he's sorry about the lies he's told about having been shot down in a helicopter ambush in Iraq. Meanwhile, the internet wants to know: what else might Williams 'misremember'?

Out of the news anchor's stunning 'mistake,' the #brianwilliamsmisremembers meme is born. 

Now, Williams is cropping up in in cleverly doctored photos across social media in which he's proudly reporting everywhere from the  moon landing to OJ Simpson's white Bronco.

Williams to thank? @TheObamaDiary thinks Williams might remember it. With a photo of the newsman cropped hastily into a shot from that famous day, they write in the voice of Williams:'I said Martin, do you dream?, he said yes. I said, 'well, tell the folks about your dreams'

Or at the March on Washington in 1963, where he personally encouraged Martin Luther King to give his I Have a Dream speech.

At least that's how @TheObamaDiary thinks Williams might remember it. With a photo of the newsman cropped hastily into a shot from that famous day, they write in the voice of Williams:

'I said Martin, do you dream?, he said yes. I said, 'well, tell the folks about your dreams'

@theObamaDiary also places Williams at the 1936 Olympics.

'Losing to Jesse Owens in Berlin was tough, but I knew I was part of history,' Williams 'misremembers.'

Twitter user @robx_d puts Williams both alongside Amelia Earhart before her faithful voyage and looking on as the flag was raised at Iwo Jima.

The photoshopped images go on and on, as do the imaginary Williams memories tweeted without photos.

It's an hilarious twist to a story over a decade in the making.

'And then I told him: "Draw me like one of your french girls"' writes Twitter user @Jenn_Abrams

@JavaJoeX imagines Williams misremembering his pivotal role in Apocalypse Now

 @JavaJoeX wonders if Williams valor may have won him the honor of becoming an action figure

Did Amelia Earhart go down with Brian Williams? @robx_d says yes

It came to a head during the Nightly News broadcast this past Wednesday evening, Williams told viewers that his mistake was a 'bungled attempt' to honor a soldier who had helped protect him.

'I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago. I want to apologize' he said.

In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the ‘fog of memory over 12 years’ for his error.

‘I feel terrible about making this mistake, especially since I found my OWN WRITING about the incident from back in '08, and I was indeed on the Chinook behind the bird that took the RPG in the tail housing just above the ramp,’ he wrote.

‘Because I have no desire to fictionalize my experience (we all saw it happened the first time) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened, I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area -- and the fog of memory over 12 years -- made me conflate the two, and I apologize.’

Saving Private Brian? @IvanTheK puts Williams in the 1998 classic WWII film

Since the 2003 incident, Williams’ Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown.

NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC’s Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.'

However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News  it stated that a ‘chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.’

Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade. 

'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.'

In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a ‘flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters’.

‘Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours. 

'There was small arms fire. … All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,’ he recalled.

By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.' 

'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote. 

'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.' 

The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his.

‘Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,’ he told Letterman. 

Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now ‘the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.’
