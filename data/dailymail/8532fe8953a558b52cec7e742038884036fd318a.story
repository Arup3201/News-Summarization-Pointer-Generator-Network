Lewis Hamilton has admitted going to war with Nico Rosberg following their ignominious fall-out in Spa has helped push him to the edge of Formula One world title glory this season.

Rosberg's decision not to back out of an accident with Mercedes team-mate Hamilton has proved highly damaging to his own championship chances.

Although Hamilton retired that day and Rosberg went on to finish as runner-up to carve out a 29-point cushion, the ramifications of that day have been severe for the German.

Abu Dhabi Grand Prix (Nov 23)

Eventually coming clean - having initially denied his culpability over the incident - the 29-year-old Rosberg was given a severe dressing down by motorsport boss Toto Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda.

What was described at the time as 'suitable disciplinary measures' were taken against Rosberg, whilst he was also forced to publicly apologise to Hamilton for his actions.

Since then the tide has turned in the battle for the championship as Hamilton has won the last five races to open up a 24-point lead over Rosberg going into the last two races, with Brazil first on Sunday.

After what transpired at Spa, Hamilton concedes at no stage did he imagine his recent run of success, although it was that incident that put fire in his belly.

'You don't really look five or 10 races ahead. I've just always kept my head down, kept chipping away,' said Hamilton.

'I had those four wins (early in the season), and then there was the bad patch from Monaco onwards.

'Then Spa was like "I'm going to turn this up. I'm going to have to turn this up. This means war", that kind of feeling.

'In reflecting on it, I turned the energy from that negative bomb into a positive.'

It would be easy to believe on the back his 10th win of the year in the United States Hamilton now has a clear psychological edge over Rosberg.

Rosberg certainly looked like a man who feared the writing to be on the wall post-race at the Circuit of the Americas.

Hamilton, though, is too canny to believe Rosberg will think himself a beaten man, certainly not with the controversial double points on offer in the final race in Abu Dhabi on November 23.

'I'm not sure I do have an edge,' said Hamilton.

'Every weekend Nico resets, he comes in and qualifies on pole. He's massively strong mentally. He's still there, still fighting.'
