A New York mother who remains in intensive care after she was struck by a shopping cart dropped by two boys needs ‘all the prayers she can get’ to recover, her grief-stricken husband said last night.

Marion Hedges has been left fighting for her life after she was hit by the falling cart when the dangerous prank went wrong on Sunday evening in the East Harlem district of Manhattan.

The 47-year-old, who works as a real estate agent, had been walking with her 13-year-old son on the ground floor of the shopping centre as the cart plummeted from a fourth floor walkway.

Critical: Marion Hedges, 47, remains in critical condition today after being hit by a shopping cart thrown from a fourth floor walkway

Her son was not injured.

Last night, her husband Michael Hedges had a grim update on her condition.

He told CBS 2: 'What I can tell you is she’s not well. Her prognosis at a minimum involves many months of painful rehabilitation.'

Marion Hedges was devoted to helping under-privileged children like the two who dropped a shopping trolley on her.

She helps out at Manhattan's Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center and was out on Sunday buying sweets for trick-or-treaters.

‘She’s
a terrific member,’ the centre’s executive director Wanda Wooten told 
the New York Daily News. ‘You can't believe this happened.’

Mrs
Hedges attended the $37,500-a-year private Spence school and then the 
$40,400-a-year Barnard College in Manhattan. She has a 13-year-old son 
and 14-year-old daughter.

The
real estate worker was the daughter of a businessman and a doctor and 
her husband is currently working in Spain for Merrill Lynch.

‘She’s a super, super nice person,’ a family friend told the New York Daily News.

’She's been involved in not for profits and charities for more than 25 years.’

Mr Hedges added: 'There’s not a lot we can do right now. It’s with the doctor and with fate’s hands.'

Meanwhile, the grandmother of one of the 12-year-old suspects said her family is wracked with sadness over the incident.

Ana Cespedes told the New York Daily News: 'I don't even know how to approach the family to wish them well. I want God to help this woman get better.'

While the 89-year-old grandmother claimed the boy was 'raised well' by his mother, neighbours told the paper that he was 'the baddest boy in the building.'

Police said the cart was thrown from a
walkway that connects a parking garage to a Target store where Mrs 
Hedges had just finished shopping.

Mrs Hedges, who also has a daughter, was rushed to Harlem Hospital where she is in critical but stable condition.

The
two boys have been charged as juveniles with felony assault and 
criminal possession of a weapon. They were arrested after one of their 
friends reported the prank to the police.

'They deliberately pushed it over the 
edge,' a law-enforcement source told the New York Post.

'They're a bunch of 
stupid kids, they made a bad decision. She was in the wrong place at the
wrong time.'

Investigation: Police seal off the crime scene and Target shopping cart which struck Mrs Hedges

According
to a family friend, Mrs Hedges was shopping for candy at Costco for the 
Stanley M Isaacs Neighborhood Center, a community centre for the 
elderly.

Mrs Hedges has worked with charities for over 25 years and is currently involved in at least six different projects. 'She is such a super, super nice person,' the friend said.

Yesterday, her father-in-law, who is also named Michael, told the Post: 'They have her sedated right now, 
she's unconscious. It's not quite clear what happened but I hear she has
some broken bones and some cranial injuries - there's some blood up 
there,' he added gesturing to his head.

'They're letting us up two at a time and 
we can only stay for five minutes.

'You can't really see anything up 
there - it's just her lying in a bed unconscious with 50 thousand tubes
in her. She's stable, they're keeping her stable and her respiratory 
system is functioning.'

Dangerous prank: The two 12-year-old boys are accused of hurling the shopping cart of the fourth-floor walkway

When asked about what should happen to 
those responsible for throwing the shopping cart, Mr Hedges said, 'They 
should have the book thrown at them.'

He also said that his grandson was 'holding up well - he's a brave young man.'

A 47-year-old friend of the family 
added: 'That is one tough kid. That little kid marched down to the 
police department this morning to give a statement. He's such a tough 
little kid. They're the nicest, kindest family.'

At a hearing on Monday, the boys were remanded in the custody of New York's Administration for Children's Services, the city's child welfare agency.

The pair will attend an arraignment hearing on November 4.
