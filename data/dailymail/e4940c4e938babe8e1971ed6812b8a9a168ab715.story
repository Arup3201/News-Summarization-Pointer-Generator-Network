Army vet: The family of Colonel Joseph Chapman were horrified to discover a stranger in his casket

A family mourning the death of a loved one were horrified to discover that a stranger was occupying the casket when they went for to view their family member's body for the last time on Friday evening.

Jim McLain and his family arrived at Everly Funeral Home in Fairfax, Virginia and quickly realized the man in the casket was not McLain's father, Joseph 'Mal' Chapman who died on November 21 and the age of 80.

Making matters worse for the grieving family, the funeral home had already buried Joseph Chapman in a plot in Winchester, instead of next to his beloved wife Carolyn who predeceased him in 2006, at Arlington National Cemetery.

A distraught McLain immediately alerted staff at the home to the mix-up,
but says he was dismissed by Everly staff who told him a mix-up was 
impossible.

Although they were convinced the man was not 
Chapman, having his identical twin, Alvin Chapman, present at the 
viewing showed that the man in the casket looked nothing like Joseph 
Chapman.

'I kept looking at him. And I was like, there's no way he could be this much changed,' McLain told WJLA.

The
man in the coffin had an 'extreme receding hairline' as opposed to 
Chapman's head of white hair, and a completely different nose.

But
when McLain alerted Everly staff to the mistake he was dismissed by 
funeral home staff who told him a mix-up was impossible.

The funeral director refused to see the family until, 15 minutes later, a member of staff checked the toe-tag on the man in Chapman's casket - which proved beyond a doubt that the wrong man had been put on display.

'This just isn’t right. This should never, never happen. This is something you read in a fiction novel or see in a movie on TV,' McLain told WJLA.

Adding insult to injury, the funeral home had dressed the wrong man in Joseph Chapman's Army uniform. Chapman was a decorated colonel and the uniform had taken him 28 years to earn.

'My dad’s uniform... that’s degradation beyond words for a military man,' McLean told WJLA, his voice breaking with emotion.

The family, not knowing what else to do, called police who told them that mixing up bodies inside a funeral home is not a crime.

'They say now they have to wait for Monday to get a judge to get an order for the body to be dug up,' McLain said.

The funeral was scheduled for Saturday, but without a body to bury, it's unclear if the family went ahead with the service.
