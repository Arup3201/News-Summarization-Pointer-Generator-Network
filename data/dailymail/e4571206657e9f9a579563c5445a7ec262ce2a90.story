An eight-year-old cancer sufferer, who became an internet sensation after millions viewed a video of his touchdown run at a Nebraska spring football game, is in remission, his father revealed today.

Jack Hoffman, who has an inoperable brain tumor, captured the hearts of Nebraska football fans when, with the players' help, he ran 69 yards to score during April's intrasquad game.

His determined run was viewed nearly 8.4 million times on YouTube and replayed on national television - and even earned him a visit to the White House to meet President Obama.

Jack's father, Andy Hoffman, said the good news about the brain tumor came after an MRI test.

'Doctors came in and said this tumor is rock-solid stable,' Hoffman said, noting doctors compared Wednesday's MRI to a baseline MRI done in June and saw the malignancy had stopped growing.

The encouraging news was tempered by warnings from the doctors: More than half of all kids in Jack's situation have relapses.

'We pray like crazy and hope Jack isn't in that segment,' Hoffman said. But it's a long journey, he continued, 'and the doctors have done a good job of preparing us'.

Jack's tumor grew back after two surgeries in 2011, and it occupies a spot near his brain stem. The location is considered inoperable now, Hoffman said, but that could change.

The boy's future is filled with MRI scans: one every three months for the next year, every six months for the year following, and then once a year.

Jack is a second-grader at a school near the family's home in Atkinson, a city of about 1,240 people in north-central Nebraska.

The brave cancer patient's chance to join the Huskers came through his family's friendship with the team's former star running back Rex Burkhead.

Burkhead befriended Jack shortly after the brain cancer was diagnosed in April 2011. Their friendship grew into the Team Jack campaign that has raised awareness and funds for research.

'Jack is a fighter, a strong kid,' Burkhead said. 'To see him run around and enjoy the Husker experience, it's a dream come true, especially for kids in the state of Nebraska.'

His video also won an ESPY award as the 'Best Moment' of the year in July.

Jack and his dad met with President 
Obama in the Oval Office in April. Republican Senator Deb Fischer from 
Nebraska helped arrange the Washington visit for the Hoffmans.

Andy Hoffman said the president presented his son with a new football and told him he was proud of him.

The rest of his family will continue to raise money for cancer research through the Team Jack Foundation.

'We're not living life in fear,' Hoffman said. 'We're busy living.'
