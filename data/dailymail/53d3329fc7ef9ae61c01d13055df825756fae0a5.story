Young people are failing to find work because they lack ‘grit’, a minister has warned.

Nick Hurd insisted that ‘social skills and discipline’ are every bit as essential for success as qualifications – yet they are not being taught in schools.

The minister for civil society also said he was struck by the ‘crushingly low’ self-confidence of many youngsters and the effect this has on their employment prospects.

Minister for Civil Society Nick Hurd said 'social skills and discipline' are as important as qualifications for success but they are not being taught in schools

His provocative comments came in response to the revelation that the number of 16- to 24-year-olds classed as ‘Neets’ –  or ‘not in education, employment or training’ – has risen to an estimated 1.09million.

Of these, 47 per cent are not looking for work and are classed as economically inactive.

And at a time when there are 529,000 job vacancies – up 56,000 in a year – it is estimated that some 640,000 Neets have never worked at all.

Mr Hurd, son of former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, said: ‘What we see in survey after survey is employers saying qualifications are important, but that just as important to us are so-called soft skills, character skills, the ability to get on with different people, to articulate yourself clearly, confidence, grit, self-control, these kind of qualities, and they are saying we are not seeing enough of this in kids coming out of school.

‘Something’s going wrong, this is a critical time in their lives to be stretching and challenging them and make them feel engaged.’

He added that the current estimate of 1.09million Neets was a ‘horrible number and it’s been high for too long’.

He said: ‘The longer they stay out of work, the bigger the problem that becomes.’

A report from the Institute for Public Policy Research last week estimated that some 640,000 Neets had never even had a job.

Spencer Thompson, an economic analyst at the Left-wing think-tank, said: ‘We know from countless surveys of employers that they value employability and that those skills are lacking among young people.

‘They need people who turn up on time, look presentable and know how to present themselves in an interview.’

A separate report from the British Chambers of Commerce also revealed how many bosses are ‘disheartened, if not downright frustrated’ by school leavers.

Mr Hurd last week visited the National Citizen Service, a volunteering programme for thousands of 16- and 17-year-olds which the Government hopes will help them develop the skills needed for the workplace.

The scheme involves two weeks of team-building skills while living away from home, then the youngsters return to run a charity venture of their choice in their local area.

It will be carried out by 34,000 young people this year, and following a funding boost from the Government ministers hope that 150,000 youngsters will have completed it by 2015.

Charities and MPs have questioned whether the money spent on running the scheme – £62million in the 2012-13 financial year – could be better invested in services to help disadvantaged youngsters.

But as no participant pays more than £50,
 Old Etonian Mr Hurd said those of all backgrounds could benefit from 
it. He added: ‘This is not for disadvantaged young people, it’s for kids
 from both ends of the spectrum, which is very powerful in breaking down
 misconceptions and building confidence.

The number of 16 to 24-year-olds not in employment, education or training has risen to 1.09million

‘The workplace has changed and most of the jobs I know require dealing with different types of people, communication skills. We need to raise our level of aspiration, show young people what they can do.’

Mr Hurd said 95 per cent of recruits told him they would otherwise be ‘on the sofa’ and the programme had ‘changed their lives’.

He added: ‘I’ve been so struck over the years by how crushingly low sometimes confidence and self-esteem are among young people and it’s amazing what impact you can have in just three weeks.’

Describing a group who completed the programme last year, he said: ‘There’s a definite before and after effect in terms of their ability to articulate and present themselves.

'The skills employers tend to talk about are social agility, the ability to get on with different types of people, and resilience, the ability to stick with things.

‘NCS is not a silver bullet, we need to create more jobs, but it plays a part alongside apprenticeships and traineeships and what we’re doing to improve our schools.’

The Education Select Committee estimates extending NCS to half of 16-year-olds would cost £350million a year – more than all youth services provided by local authorities.

Sir Terry Leahy, Tesco chief executive, said employers were being left to 'pick up the pieces'

Bosses have frequently claimed that young people are unable to find work because they are not taught the right skills at school.

Sir Terry Leahy, who at the time was boss of Tesco, delivered a stinging attack on the education system in 2009.

He called it ‘woeful’ and said employers were too often ‘left to pick up the pieces’.Sir Terry told an industry conference in London: ‘One area that Tesco is particularly concerned about is education.

‘As the largest private employer in 
the country, we depend on high standards in our schools. Sadly, despite 
all the money that has been spent, standards are still woefully low in 
too many schools. Employers like us are often left to pick up the 
pieces.’ 

He added: ‘From 
my perspective there are too many agencies and bodies, often issuing 
reams of instructions to teachers, who then get distracted from the task
 at hand: teaching children.’

Sir
 Stuart Rose, at the time the Marks & Spencer chairman, made similar
 comments only a week later, claiming school leavers were ‘not fit for 
work’.

He said too many young people were leaving school without a basic grasp of the three Rs.In an outspoken attack, the retailing boss said: ‘They cannot do reading. They cannot do arithmetic. They cannot do writing.’

Sir Terry, who was brought up on a Liverpool council estate and educated at a grammar school, was the only one of four brothers not to leave school at 16.

He rose to the position of chief executive at Tesco after starting his career at the supermarket chain stacking shelves and washing floors.
