Thumbs up for phablets: the finger is designed for owners of big screen phones who struggle to reach the edge of the screen

Later this year Apple is expected to join the big-screen market with a larger iPhone.

Two models - a 4.7inch screen and 5.5inch screen version are rumoured.

It is claimed the smaller version will be available in September, with the larger 5.5inch screen model following later in the year.

It measures 49mm long by 25mm wide, and the internal width is 20mm according to Ratoken, which is selling the gadget.

Inside is a stylus so the finger will work on any touchscreen.

The gadget comes as makers are increasingly moving towards larger phones.

In September Apple is expected to release a new, bigger version of the iPhone, with two models rumoured - a 4.7inch screen and 5.5inch screen version.

Apple suppliers around the world are believed to be already gearing up to produce the larger screens.

Japan Display, Sharp, and South Korea's LG Display have all been tapped to make the panels, and its thought they have already begun mass production.

If the rumours are true, both iPhone 6 screens will be larger than the current 4-inch panels on Apple's iPhone 5S and 5C models.

Samsung also offers the Galaxy Mega phone – the biggest smartphone on the global market - which boasts a 6.3inch screen.

Samsung have described it as a hybrid that combines the portability of a smartphone with the immersive experience that a tablet offers for movies, books, music and games.

The thumb-stylus went through a lot of rigorous testing and changes to the shape, size, and positioning, until they came up with this beauty, according to Ratoken.

. At one point they thought they almost had it, but it looked too much like a zombie finger – they’d been so concerned with how it worked, that they’d forgotten to think about the colour! The finished product is now a more alive-looking natural skin colour (so long as you’re not dark-skinned). Then there’s the stylus that runs through it, which is the part that you actually touch to the screen, and makes it look like you’ve hammered a nail through your flesh. It may not really be fooling anyone but hey, if it works, it works.

Extend your thumb by 15 millimeters! Why? So you can use your phone more easily! With its completely life-like design, no one will even notice! Rakuten is currently offering this stylish thumb made by Rare Mono for just 1,480 yen (US$14.50). It could change your life.
