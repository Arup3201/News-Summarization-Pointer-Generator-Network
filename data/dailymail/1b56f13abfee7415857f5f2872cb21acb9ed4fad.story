A producer at NBC has told of Matt Lauer's germaphobia. He allegedly uses Purell all the time after shaking fans' hands

Matt Lauer is so paranoid about germs that he uses hand sanitiser after shaking hands with the public, according to a report.

The Today show host meets and greets dozens of people every day after they have arrived to watch the filming of America's most popular morning show.

But after he has said hello he secretly pulls out a bottle of Purell that he keeps in his pocket at all times and applies it to his hands to get rid of any disease.

Lauer's actions are likely to dishearten his legion of fans who could interpret his actions as insulting.

But
according to New York magazine they are the least of his worries - he 
also hates doing celebrity stories but swallows his pride and gets on 
with the job.

Lauer has been
the Today anchor since 1997 and is widely regarded as one of the most 
trusted and dependable hosts on TV. He is also the highest paid and 
earned a reported $17million last year.

The report in New York Magazine is from an unnamed producer who works on Today, which is on NBC and draws around 4.75million viewers every day.

The producer writes: 'Matt is known as the germophobe of the anchor team.

Lauer also fears he doesn't always get enough journalistic credibility.  He is photographed left at a benefit and right interviewing Justin Bieber in November

'He walks around with a bottle of 
Purell in his pocket. He's constantly out shaking hands with the crowd, 
and the minute he turns away, he's Purell-ing his hands.

'If you ever walk in his office, it's like a museum - he's meticulous.'

The
producer explains how Today and ABC's Good Morning America engage in 
fierce competition each morning to get the best stories.

But when it comes to presenting them on-air, Lauer is not exactly enthusiastic about the celebrity material.

The producer writes: 'Matt has, sort of, I don't want to describe it as highbrow, but sensitivity about his journalistic credentials.

'He only wants to go after what he perceives as really important stories. Did he want to do Kim Kardashian filing for divorce? Absolutely not. He hates the seedy, gossipy stuff—but he has to do it.'

Lauer, 54, has recently the subject of speculation that he was going to be replaced on Today by E! presenter Ryan Seacrest, 37.

NBC's entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt was forced to address the issue during a recent speech in which he claimed that keeping Lauer on Today was his top priority.

In the article the Today producer said that if Lauer does decide to leave then he 'wouldn't be surprised if they offer him $20 million' to stay.

He writes: 'The succession planning for that show is key. And Matt has been rumored to leave the show at the end of this year, when his contract is up.'

Nobody from NBC was available for comment
