British pilots celebrated after a key EU transport committee of MEPs rejected plans to impose controversial new flight time rules which they believe were unsafe.

Pilots claim the proposed changes to flying hours and rostered rest periods will put lives at risk by increasing the chances of fatigued fliers falling asleep in the cockpits of packed passenger planes.  

The proposals still face further votes in coming weeks by the full European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, in which British ministers have a voice.

Puts lives at risk: British pilots are celebrating after a EU transport committee rejected plans to impose controversial new flight time rules which they say are unsafe

The rules must be backed by both votes to go ahead but air transport experts believe the rejection by the EU’s Transport and Tourism Select Committee – by 20 votes to 13 – increases the chances of the new rules being kicked out.

The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) hailed the committee’s rejection as a ‘vote for common sense’ and called on the British Government and MEPs ‘to act to protect the safety of our skies'.

Today, BALPA published polling evidence and personal testimonials from pilots admitting that both captain and co-pilot fell asleep in the cockpit at the same time. It also recorded testimony of a pilot whose over-tired captain nodded-off low over London as his aircraft came in to land at Gatwick Airport.

Last week BALPA revealed a poll of 500 pilots showing six out of 10 said they had fallen asleep in the cockpit and of those, almost one in three said they woke to find the other pilot was also asleep. And one in six had been in the cockpit when both flight crew were asleep.

After the EU vote, BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan said: ‘British pilots will welcome the EU Transport Committee’s rejection of the proposed EU cuts to UK flight safety.

‘The botched new rules have been rejected by scientists, MPs on the UK Transport Committee, British pilots with 40 million hours of flying experience between them and by the public, 90 per cent of whom are concerned that a pilot could be landing their aircraft having been awake for 22hours.’

‘The commission must now go back to the drawing board and work with pilots and scientists to develop rules on flying time and tiredness that are based on evidence and expert experience. 

‘Pilots will continue to urge UK Ministers, MEPs and the CAA to protect the safety of our skies and help pilots make every flight a safe flight.’

BALPA will press British MEPs to vote against the proposals in a full session of the European Parliament and for the UK Government Ministers to oppose them in the EU Council of Ministers. 

It will also press transport ministers in the UK to order an audit of the proposals by an independent group of scientists and medical experts.

Today pilots’ leaders released a damning new dossier of first-hand testimony from jetlagged flight crew admitting to falling asleep in the cockpit – sometimes simultaneously.

One transatlantic long-haul pilot reported how both he and his captain were asleep at the same time at night and woken only by the aircraft’s warning alert system. He said: ‘I was taking my turn of 40 minutes controlled rest, in the cruise, crossing the Atlantic on a night flight.

‘I was woken after about 20 minutes by a warning sound from the aircraft. The captain was awoken at the same time as me. It appears that he had also fallen asleep at the same time, the pilot alert system had been ignored and so the aircraft reacted to wake us up.’

A captain also admitted being asleep while his co-pilot also slept leaving no one in charge. 

He
said: ‘I have fallen asleep at the controls in command twice. On the 
one occasion my colleague was having a “controlled rest”.’

Another pilot told BALPA how his captain nodded off low over London at a ‘critical’ stage of the plane’s landing approach to Gatwick Airport.  As the plane was lined up to head into Gatwick and link with the airport’s instrument landing system, the co-pilot spoke to his captain to prepare the plane for the manoeuvre, but noted: ‘The captain did not respond. I asked him a second time and shook him at which he woke up.’

The pilot said: ‘He had fallen asleep between taking a radio call from ATC [air traffic control] and me requesting flap. He fell asleep over a distance say of three miles while the aircraft was between 2-3,000ft in the London area. After landing the captain signed off fatigued. He was signed off by his doctor for a month.’

The testimony followed publication by the CAA of an incident report from a Virgin Atlantic pilot flying an Airbus saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days but the pair were not asleep simultaneously.

Louise Ellman, who chairs the influential all-party House of Commons Transport Committee and is Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, said: ‘I agree with BALPA’s concerns that the proposed changes to EU rules could endanger air passenger safety.

‘Our committee has already warned that the changes could mean pilots landing planes after being awake for 22 hours.’

‘There is still time for the UK Government and Europe to think again.’
