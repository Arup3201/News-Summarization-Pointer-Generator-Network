Apple boss Tim Cook has warned against plans for online snooping on private emails and information in the name of fighting terrorism.

Defending people's 'basic human right' to privacy, the CEO of the world's largest technology company said governments and other companies have no right to spy on emails and personal data.

He added laws on snooping were not necessary to stop terrorism, but allowing authorities to access sensitive personal data would breach a 'basic human right' and have 'dire consequences'.

Apple boss Tim Cook has warned snooping  in the name of fighting terrorism would have 'dire consequences'

Speaking during the last leg of a trip to Europe and Israel, his views contrast those of Prime Minister David Cameron and other governments. 

After the terror attacks on Paris last month, Mr Cameron pledged to introduce 'more comprehensive' powers to monitor terror suspects in the UK. 

He promised a Conservative government after the next general election would introduce new laws to monitor all messages sent by British citizens online. 

But Mr Cook branded those who insist monitoring laws are needed to fight terror and crime as 'scare-mongerers'. 

'None of us should accept that the government or a company or anybody should have access to all of our private information. This is a basic human right,' he told The Telegraph.

'We all have a right to privacy. We shouldn't give it up.' 

He added: 'History has taught us that privacy breaches have resulted in very dire consequences.

Mr Cook admitted that we 'must do everything we can' to stop terrorism, but he refuses to accept that privacy needs to be compromised in order to do so. 

He added monitoring would only lead to terrorists encrypting their data, so the only people affected would be 'good people'.

In this scenario, he believes the private, financial, health and personal data of ordinary civilians would inevitably 'be taken'.

Mr Cook is currently busy with the company's plans to launch the highly-anticipated smartwatch in April. 

Apple has already sent out invitations for a media event in San Francisco on March 9, about a month before the new Apple Watch hits stores.

The world's largest technology company did not specify what the event will be about in the invitation which reads simply 'Spring Forward,' a word play on the resetting of watches for daylight saving time.
