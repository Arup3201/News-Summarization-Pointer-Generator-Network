The Great British Bake Off. It's as indicative of an English summer as the first swallow or the scent of mown grass.

I have been looking forward to this new series - the fourth - as keenly as if it were a hot man and a first date.

In fact, don’t even bother asking me on a date on a Tuesday night from now on, because I will be glued to the telly, lost in a safe, mummy world of greaseproof paper, icing sugar and floral fairy-cake cases.

The only challenge will be whether the oven was hot enough or the crème patissiere has curdled. Will Mary Berry be in an outrageous outfit from Topshop that will do more for the British economy than any amount of quantitative easing? Will her fellow judge Paul Hollywood have mellowed and managed to use less hair gel? 

The Great British Bake Off is like a drug, and I can't get enough of it. Already my head is brimming with palette knives, cake tins and different types of nut. But the thing is, I'm the nut.

I have never cooked a cake on my own in my life. I have never owned a bag of flour or a wooden spoon. A rolling pin would be as unusual a sight in my immaculate home as a sofa from DFS. Food has been as absent in my life as a man who loves me and children. 

I am starting to realise that my life of abstention from calories is not entirely unrelated to the fact my life is now about loneliness. I am thin, but I am unhappy. I have a stainless steel kitchen island, but it is unscratched. A bit like me: pristine but sterile.

In case you are unfamiliar with my neuroses, let me enlighten you. 

Can't cook, won't cook: Liz has never baked a cake in her life

I have been an anorexic since the age of 11 when my mum approached me with a breakfast in bed of warm, buttered toast and marmalade, and I shrank - fuelled by 19 magazine's calorie-counter - as if I were Superwoman faced with Kryptonite.

I grew up on Cosmo magazine, believing women were supposed to have careers, not cookers.

I have never owned a recipe book in my life, believing that my mum, who was a housewife and cooked everything for her seven children from scratch, was a martyr - a slave to mixing (the only appliance she owned was a hand whisk, with a handle she had to turn) and washing-up (we never owned a dishwasher or a washing machine).

'I vowed, aged 11, I would never cook a thing for myself, nor for a man. And, on the whole, I haven't'

As a teenager, my mum would proudly parade fairy cakes, rock cakes, chocolate sponges and a Christmas cake with rough icing she said was 'a snowstorm', crowned with a Santa whose red trousers became more pink as the years went by.

In return, I would lambast her every time she approached me with a floral plate and a teeny fork and an anxious face. Don't offer me that rubbish! I don't want to spend my life with a face flushed red from a range - I want a career! It is anti-feminist to own a pastry brush!

And my mum and her morsels would retreat, deflated.

I vowed, aged 11, I would never cook a thing for myself, nor for a man. And, on the whole, I haven't. Men would have to love me for who I am, what I do, not for how I filled their stomachs.

Back on Tuesday evenings; Liz loves the eccentricity of the Great British Bake Off

I was too good to be covered in flour. I wanted to go to aerobics class and lift weights, not whisk and beat until my muscles ached.

At school I even rebelled in domestic science, saying the tea towels smelled and turned my stomach. And, in any case, I was a vegan, and cream oppressed animals.

Just as I was excused biology, for refusing to dissect a once-living creature, I was excused cooking and told to take extra sewing classes instead.

Cooking, to me, spelled being fat, and that was the last thing I wanted to be. Cooking spelled mess, which, as an OCD sufferer, was as unwelcome as herpes to a hooker. Even today, faced with the choice of toast and crumbs or nothing, I will choose the latter.

But somehow, I just cannot get my fill of the Great British Bake Off.

'Mary Berry, who oozes safety and forgiveness. Nothing bad could happen while she is in charge'

Perhaps the fact that the hit BBC2 series is filmed in a marquee has something to do with my addiction.

A marquee, with its unique smell and diffused light, reminds me of the horticultural shows of my youth, when I always entered the Dress A Wooden Spoon competition and failed. Or perhaps it is reminiscent of weddings where the groom loves the bride and doesn’t slope off to spend time with his mates before cheating on his new wife.

Perhaps, too, I love this programme because of the contestants, who are hapless and normal, don't seem to care about their waistlines and have families to call excitedly with news after every triumph and failure. This programme to me is like porn: a fantasy world not of sex, but of families and normality and comfort and fires and messy kitchens.

I never have anyone to call when things have gone wrong or right, or when I land at Heathrow Airport after yet another long, dusty, lonely assignment abroad. This programme reeks of home.

Most of all, though, I love TGBBO because of Mary Berry, who oozes safety and forgiveness. Nothing bad could happen while Mary is in charge.

Baker's dozen: The latest contestants are all 'hapless and normal'

She reminds me so much of my mum, who spent her life baking but who is now so ill and disabled she can only be given syringed warm water from a pipette. I want my mum back, but in the meantime I have Mary.

I want to tell my mum I am sorry I rejected her Victoria sponge in favour of fitting into a size six pair of brown trousers.

'Maybe I would be a nicer person, more content, if I owned an apron'

I remember the Sunday afternoon she begged me to eat a Yorkshire pudding because I had been awake all night, delirious, unable to even form sentences, so emaciated was I, so insane from the anorexia, and I dashed the hot, fatty pan to the floor.

She didn't admonish or berate me, but merely said she would fix me a poached tomato on Nimble bread instead.

Does the new series of TGBBO disappoint? Is it as flat as a meringue that has been whisked too vigorously, or my own deflated breasts? The hell it is!

The moment Paul says 'Welcome to yeast' to the eager contestants, you know that all is right in the world.

There is a new baker's dozen of contestants to roll around the tongue.

Summer fete feel: Liz loves the fact the show is set in a marquee

Among them are Ruby, the student with the startling blue eyes and a desire to please; Rob, who designs space satellites and is crowned master baker for the very first time; Deb, the dentist for people with special needs (was there ever a more holistic job description?); and Glenn, the sixth-form teacher who is as big as a house.

The comfort, the normality, oozes from them.

A cake is deemed to have 'gone a bit pottery class' because Mark the carpenter forgot to pre-heat the oven. But other than that, all is right in this big old scary world. Which surely makes a nice change.

Meeting her heroine: Liz with Mary

For the opening show of this series, Mary was wearing last summer's Whistles floral blazer, which tells me she has her priorities in order, and, like my mum, was brought up during the war when there were more important things to worry about than being able to buy the new Willow bag from Mulberry. She is frugal, not vain. Just like my mum.

And I learn stuff from the Bake Off: to 'temper' is to cool chocolate, not fly into a mood.

Maybe I would be a nicer person, more content, if I owned an apron. Maybe when a man comes for the weekend I could get out the whisk. I might even contemplate buying a loose-bottomed tin and worry less about my own bottom.

I might even download the recipes and dream of the perfect Angel Food cake.

The Great British Bake Off works in the same way Downton Abbey does: it is a British fete on a warm afternoon. It's not cool, it's not PC, it's a bit cheesy. But it is fabulous. Even for women like me.
