A jewellery shop, believed to be the oldest in Britain, is facing closure after more than 300 years in business.

Parsons the Jewellers opened its doors in Bristol in 1710 and was run by the same family for at least ten generations.

But the shop's current owner, Paul Davis, 62, has said it is set to be closed because no one has shown any interest in taking it on from him.

Mr Davis estimates that the 304-year-old shop has made more than 100,000 engagement rings over its history, providing more than half of those made in the South West city

He estimates that the 304-year-old shop has made more than 100,000 engagement rings over its history, providing more than half of those made in the South West city.

’It’s the oldest and one of the best known brands in Bristol and the public love our shop,' father-of-four Mr Davis said.

‘We have a ring in the window that was crafted in 1860, but I’m certain earlier pieces survive.’

Its first shop in a Tudor building on Redcross Street in Bristol’s Old Market was founded in 1710 by George Edgecumbe who trained as a brass founder and then moved into clock-making.

His son married Elizabeth Parsons and it was their son, George, who branched out into jewellery.

The original shop remained for 250 
years until 1966 when it was demolished to make way for a roundabout and
 the company moved to the Broadmead shopping centre.

A second branch of the shop, which had opened in 1888, was devastated in a wartime blitz.

In
 2006 the company moved to its current premises in the Galleries 
Shopping Centre, but still kept its trademark statue of Cupid perched 
above the shop front.

Mr
 Davis bought the company 15 years ago when the Parsons family ran out 
of heirs - but he’s decided to sell up as he gets older.

He said: ‘We are proud of our rich heritage.

‘The shop has seen wars, recession and many moves but it still attracts young couples to buy our trademark coloured diamonds.'

He added: ‘The business does very well, but obviously it could always do better - I’m just looking for someone to take over who has a good eye for a diamond in the rough.

‘I don’t think I could manage another busy Christmas but Parsons is such an institution, you could never let it die.

‘I feel like a caretaker here. The people of Bristol, I’m sure, would want to see it continue.’
