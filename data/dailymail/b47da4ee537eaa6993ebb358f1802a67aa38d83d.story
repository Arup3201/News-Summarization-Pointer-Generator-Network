Rising global temperatures, rather than human hunters, were the main reason woolly mammoths became extinct,  scientists claim.

Thousands of years before modern humans left Africa, they say, climate change drove mammoths to the brink of extinction.

Warmer weather caused their numbers to plummet as their grassy habitat was destroyed.

The woolly mammoth was driven to extinction by warmer weather, according to new research. Genetic analyses reveals the iconic beast of the Ice Age was strongly affected by past changes in climate

British and Swedish scientists carried
 out genetic analysis on scores of remains discovered across northern 
Europe, Asia and America.

They
 found that global warming 120,000 years ago caused the mammoth 
population to fall from several million to just tens of thousands, 
living in small pockets around the world.

The
 following Ice Age allowed their numbers to recover, however, and in 
Europe a distinct sub-group evolved from the survivors, flourishing for 
millennia before dying out around 30,000 years ago.

Then,
 10,000 years ago, the onset of the latest warm period – which is still 
going on – spelled doom for the remaining populations of the giant 
mammal, which was unable to adapt.

‘We
 found that a previous warm period some 120,000 years ago caused 
populations to decline and become fragmented, in line with what we would
 expect for cold-adapted species such as the woolly mammoth,’ said lead 
author Eleftheria Palkopoulou, from the Swedish Museum of Natural 
History.

The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, involved DNA sequencing of a large number of mammoth remains found across northern Eurasia and North America

The research, 
published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, challenges 
long-held views that mammoths were resilient and thrived in the warmer 
climate.

In fact, scientists
 said, they were at risk whenever temperatures rose – and it is very 
likely that climate change was the main reason they died out, with 
hunting by humans a less important factor.

By
 looking at differences in DNA samples and tracing migration patterns, 
scientists were able to establish that the mammoth population plummeted,
 then recovered, before the species became extinct.

The
 findings suggest mammoths were isolated to small areas of good habitat 
in a warm spell 120,000 years ago, before numbers bounced back during 
the following Ice Age.

But 
the latest warm period finally signalled the end for the mammoth. 
Researchers said that as the Earth heated up again, mammoths were once 
more confined to smaller and smaller areas suitable for them to graze. 
‘This process culminated with a severe decline in population size that 
started when temperatures began to increase at the end of the last Ice 
Age,’ said Dr Jessica Thomas, a researcher from York University.

‘This
 suggests that spells of warm climate made the mammoth more susceptible 
to extinction,’ said Dr Love Dalen from the Swedish Museum of Natural 
History.

The study showed mammoth populations became highly dynamic during the second half of the last Ice Age where some expanded and others - such as the European variety - disappeared

To understand why 
the species as a whole became extinct, scientists said they would have 
to examine the last outposts where mammoths survived, such as remote St 
Paul Island in Alaska and Wrangel Island off the coast of Siberia.

The
 study concluded: ‘It thus seems likely that environmental changes 
played a significant role in shaping the woolly mammoth’s demographic 
history, with warm periods restricting the amount of available habitat 
and cold periods leading to population expansions, both owing to 
increases in the amount of steppe–tundra and through sea level-driven 
exposure of the Bering Land Bridge.’

Woolly mammoths could roam Earth again, according to one eminent scientist who believes frozen DNA from newly discovered frozen mammoths could be the key to the species' resurrection.

Stem cell scientist Sir Ian Wilmut who is best known for cloning the world's first mammal, Dolly the sheep, thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of the prehistoric animal.

The source of viable mammoth cells could come from a number of frozen bodies discovered in the Siberian permafrost in recent years. Here you can see frozen tissue and blood

The giant beasts lived in the late Pleistocene period, tens of thousands of years ago.

Their numbers were thought to have fallen across North America and on mainland Eurasia around 10,000 years ago, probably as a result of hunting by our ancestors as well as a changing climate.
