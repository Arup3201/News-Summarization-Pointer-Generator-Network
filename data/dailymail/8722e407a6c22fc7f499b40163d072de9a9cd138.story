Australians love travelling overseas, and there's nowhere more popular than New York. And the Big Apple is also the place where we spend more money while travelling than anywhere else.

New figures have revealed that over 530,000 Aussie travellers spend the most of their hard-earned money in New York each year, with the average price for a hotel room being $317 per night, higher than any other destination for Australians. 

'There is nowhere else like it in the world - it really is a unique city that is edgier than Sydney or Melbourne,' Hotels.com regional director Katherine Cole told Daily Mail Australia.

The Affinia Manhattan is the most popular hotel among the 530,000 Australians that flock to New York City each year

'New York has always been the number one with Australians, and the most expensive. That hasn't changed in the past five years,' Ms Cole said. 

Ms Cole said that when searching for accommodation, Australians look for value for money and location above all.

Despite Australians being keen bargain hunters, New York still draws a crowd, with some of the most popular hotels to stay at including the Park Central New York Hotel, the iconic Roosevelt Hotel, and the luxurious Belvedere Hotel.

Hotels.com have compiled a list of the ten most popular places in New York with Australians, with the top choice being the Affinia Manhattan.

The boutique hotel is located on Seventh Avenue at 31st Street in Manhattan, and captures the best of the bustling New York City atmosphere.

Second on the list is Wyndham New Yorker on Eighth Avenue, another four-star hotel located in the heart of Manhattan
