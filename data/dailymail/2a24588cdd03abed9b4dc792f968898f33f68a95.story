Fat-cat Greeks have secretly shifted more than €228billion euros out of their country's crisis-hit banks and into accounts in Switzerland, according to a report.

The big money is fleeing the country as rich Greeks fear the possible re-introduction of their old currency, the drachma, would instantly halve the value of their euros if they are left in Greek banks.

Most of the money is being transferred via Cyprus by Greek industrialists using their foreign subsidiaries to channel it out of the debt-ridden country, where tens of thousands of workers launched a general strike yesterday.

Markus Korll, from the German 
financial services group Roland Berger, told Bild: 'During the past few 
months alone more than 10billion euros has been moved abroad.'

Greek
 newspapers have also reported that people flying abroad - including 
nuns, priests and the unemployed - are being stopped at Athens airport 
with suitcases full of euros.

Martin
 Schulz, leader of the Social Democrats in the European Parliament, 
called for the Swiss to impose a 25 per cent tax on the money.

He said: 'In this way we can at least limit this massive flight of capital.

'People secretly moving millions out of the country can't be poor. They must pay their share.

'I can understand why the "little people" are taking to the streets to rebel against this injustice.'

Bild says that Greek banking bosses have 
already warned the government about the growing panic at bank cash desks
 and the ever-increasing flood of capital abroad.

Government advisers are also warning of 
the dangers of a Northern-Rock style storm outside the banks and the 
need for capital controls, including disconnecting ATM machines, the 
paper reports.

The two-day general strike grounded 
flights, disrupted public transport and shut down everything from shops 
to schools today - as at least 50,000 protesters converged in central 
Athens.

Violent clashes broke out between riot police and protesters near the Greek parliament building, with petrol bombs and rocks being thrown at officers.

Resentment: An estimated 50,000 protesters have converged on the centre of Athens to rally against austerity measures due to be passed tomorrow

Fury: A report has revealed that wealthy Greeks have secretly shifted more than £200billion in euros to banks in Switzerland over concerns the country could leave the single currency

No nonsense: Riot police stand shoulder to shoulder as they try to prevent the march of protesters

All sectors, from dentists, state 
hospital doctors and lawyers to shop owners, tax office workers and dock
 workers walked off the job ahead of a parliament vote tomorrow on new 
austerity measures.

Flights were due to resume at noon after air traffic controllers scaled back their initial strike plan from 48 hours to 12.

Ferries
 remained tied up in port, while public transport workers staged 
stoppages, although buses, trolleys and the Athens metro were expected 
to remain in operation.

Stink: Rubbish lies piled up on a side street in the Greek capital. Refuse workers have been on strike for 17 days

Several thousand police deployed in the capital, blocking a road by parliament and shutting down two nearby metro stations.

Nikos
 Anastasopoulos, heard of a workers' union for an Athens municipality, 
said: 'We just can't take it any more. There is desperation, anger and 
bitterness.'

Demonstrations during a similar 48-hour strike in June left the centre of Athens badly damaged as rioters clashed with police.

Piles
 of rubbish continue to rot on street corners despite a civil 
mobilisation order issued yesterday to order crews back to work after a 
17-day strike.

Civil servants have also staged sit-ins in government buildings, including the Finance Ministry.

The
 new austerity measures have been so unpopular that MPs from the 
governing Socialist have indicated they might vote against some of them.

But Greece must pass the bills if it is to continue receiving funds from its 110billion euro bailout.

Unless
 it receives the now long-overdue final installment of the bailout, it 
has said it will run out of funds to pay salaries and pensions by 
mid-November.

Blockade: Ferries, like these in Piraeus, have remained in ports as thousands of workers walked off their jobs today

Unrest: Many of the shops in the centre of Athens have closed their doors during the 48-hour general strike, which last time descended into clashes between protesters and riot police
