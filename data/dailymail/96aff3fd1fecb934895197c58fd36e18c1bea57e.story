Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

Italian newspaper Corrierre dello Sport say that Real Madrid will bid £72million (90m euros) to sign Liverpool striker Luis Suarez.

Despite no Italian clubs being linked with Suarez, the paper still decide to splash on the move because the striker will line up for Uruguay against Italy at the World Cup on June 24.

Moving on? Barcelona's Xavi is wanted by Al Sadd in Qatar and Liverpool's Luis Suarez is a target for Real

Real's interest in Suarez is well known with Spanish daily Marca reporting the same facts - that Real will bid £72m - on Thursday.

A day earlier they reported that Real president Florentino Perez had told manager Carlo Ancelotti that Suarez was the next galatico the club wanted to sign.

Should Real manage to sign Suarez for £72m they will be getting a bargain as the striker was valued at £79million by the CIES Football Observatory in an independent study published this week.

Brendan Rodgers will not want to lose his star man as Liverpool gear up for their first Champions League campaign in four years. But should such a huge offer come in, then the club's resolve will surely be tested.

Meanwhile in Spain, Sport claim that Barcelona stalwart Xavi has been offered a four-year deal worth £10m to join Al Sadd in Qatar. The 34-year-old, however, prefers to stay in Barcelona.

All change: Barcelona want Rakitic to replace Chelsea bound Fabregas but Benzema looks to be staying at Real

One player who looks set to be staying in Spain is French striker Karim Benzema, who tells Spanish daily Marca that 'If it was down to me I would stay at Madrid all of my life'.

The Real Madrid star also reveals the reason boss Ancelotti is so successful is because he remains calm at all times. Benzema goes on to claim that the boos from the Madrid fans do not bother him because even club legend Zinedine Zidane suffered abuse from the stands. And importantly he says he has always had the support of Perez.

The paper also carry a smaller story on Cesc Fabregas' increasingly likely move to Chelsea. They claim the move is almost done and that Barcelona are looking at Sevilla's Ivan Rakitic as a replacement.

The same story is the splash for Mundo Deportivo, who go further and say Barcelona and Sevilla are in advanced talks over Rakitic and that Barcelona are merely waiting on the player's decision. They also report that Chelsea have put in a £27m (31m euro) bid for Cesc Fabregas.

Mundo believe that Barcelona are also looking at Dortmund's Marco Reus and want him to link up with Neymar and Lionel Messi in what they are calling a 'fantasy forward line'.

And finally, they boldly declare Spain's starting line-up for the opening World Cup match with Holland on June 13. The starting XI is: Casillas, Azpilicueta, Ramos, Pique, Alba, Busquets, Alonso, Xavi, Iniesta, Cesc, Silva
