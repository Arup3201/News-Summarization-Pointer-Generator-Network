A former UK police officer falsely claimed more than £45,000 in benefits from a London council after emigrating to Australia.

Vanessa Turner, 32, who worked for Surrey Police, claimed she was living in Croydon, south London, as a single mum.

In fact she’d made a new life for herself with the father of her three children, Jack Price.

She was prosecuted after Croydon Council’s corporate anti-fraud team received an anonymous tip off saying she was living in Australia.

Turner told authorities she was a single parent living in Park Lane, Croydon, and claimed housing and council tax benefit as well as income support.

Between 2007 and 2010, the mother-of-three received nearly £38,000 in housing benefit, £5,686 of council tax benefit and £3,327 in income support.

During the investigation Miss Turner denied knowing Mr Price and claimed she had been holidaying in Australia.

But council investigators discovered she had been making monthly transfers to Mr Price’s bank account, and had made payments to a shipping company to transport her belongings to Australia.

Mr Price was also found to be the registered owner of the flat where she was claiming housing benefit.

Miss Turner was given a 12-month 
suspended sentence at Croydon Crown Court on March 8, after pleading 
guilty at an earlier hearing.

Judge Timothy Stowe described the crime as deliberate, systematic fraud, adding she had disguised herself as an honest tenant and had deceived both the council and the Department of Work and Pensions.

He ordered her to complete 160 hours unpaid work and pay £2,258.60 in court costs. The council will now seek to recover the £45,000 benefit claim.

Councillor Dudley Mead, cabinet member for finance and resources, said: 'I hope this case acts as warning to others cheating the system - it doesn’t matter who or where you are we will catch up with you eventually and will always prosecute where possible.

'Croydon’s benefit system is to help people in the borough who are in genuine need and it is criminals like this who set out to fraudulently claim money they are not entitled to who make it more difficult for honest people to get the help they need.'
