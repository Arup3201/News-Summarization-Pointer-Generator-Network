Celebrity chef Annabel Karmel said she wanted to 'curl up' and never get up again after a former employee accused her of sexual harassment.

The 57-year-old author and chef fired Mark Salter last June just four months after he had been employed as a sales director.

Last month she settled a case with Mr Salter, offering to pay him £3,000.

Mark Salter, pictured, had sued Ms Karmel for £50,000 but according to the chef the case was settled for £3,000

Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Ms Karmel said the case has had a major impact on her life.

She said: 'My career depends on my reputation and here he was trying to wreck it. He didn't have a shred of evidence but it has cost me £60,000 to defend my name.'

'I just wanted to curl up and never get up again. I remember going home and collapsing in the hall and weeping. I just felt it couldn't be happy again.'

Mr Salter was initially looking for £50,000 in compensation from the renowned celebrity chef.

Ms Karmel added: 'I am speaking out because I want to clear my name. I want to get on with my life but I also want to help other people who have suffered from this. There out to be a register of people who have sued companies and why.'

The Sunday Telegraph claimed that Mr Salter has had seven jobs over the past decade and taken three legal cases against former employers.

The employment tribunal heard claims that Ms Karmel had made sexual comments to Mr Salter.

He also said she wore provocative clothing in a bid to seduce him before dismissing him just four months after he joined her firm.

Mrs Karmel had tried to keep the hearing secret, obtaining a gagging order preventing publication of her name, her company’s name and the name of her former employee.

Her legal team argued that her reputation and status as a ‘well-known media personality’ would be irreparably damaged regardless of the outcome of the case because it involved an  allegation of sexual misconduct.

But the Daily Mail successfully  challenged the order. Employment judge James Tayler ruled it was ‘patronising to the British public to assume that they are incapable of understanding that an allegation is just that until it has been proved’.

The judge said ‘the fact that a hearing will involve the airing of information that is personal and embarrassing and engages the qualified right to respect for private and family life’ is not ‘sufficient to outweigh the principle of open justice’.

Mrs Karmel contested all the allegations made at the four-day employment tribunal hearing in central London.

Last month she agreed terms with her former sales manager following hours of legal wrangling.

He withdrew his claim of sexual misconduct as part of an undisclosed settlement. In a statement issued through her lawyers, Mrs Karmel said: ‘Mark Salter has withdrawn his employment tribunal claim and unreservedly retracted the allegations against me.

‘I have defended his claim throughout and am glad this has now been resolved. It has been agreed that neither party will make any further comment on this matter.’

It has been reported that Mr Salter claimed the celebrity author ‘only employed good-looking men’ and made inappropriate comments about his good looks in front of clients.

In between discussions with her legal team she found time to tweet nutritional advice for babies and young children, urging mothers to ‘keep food in large chunks’ for youngsters to hold on to.

The food guru has published 37 books, is regularly on television, radio and in the Press and her business has expanded to include baby products and ready meals. Mrs Karmel says she was inspired to create healthy meals following the death of her first child, Natasha, and because of her son Nicholas’ fussy eating habits. She has two other grown-up children.

Divorced from their father, oil broker Simon Karmel, she lives in a £20million home in one of London’s most sought after districts with film producer partner Stephen Margolis.

Her books carry the seal of approval of Great Ormond Street Hospital and she was awarded an MBE in 2006.
