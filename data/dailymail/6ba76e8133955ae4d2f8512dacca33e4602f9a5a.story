Pep Guardiola, never satisfied. Despite averaging six goals a game in their last three matches, the Bayern Munich manager has insisted his team must improve their attacking threat.

The Bundesliga leaders have overcome their previous opposition 4-1, 6-0 and 8-0 in their last three league games, but after a 2-0 cup win against Eintracht Braunschweig, Guardiola implored his side to improve.

'We must do better in attack,' he told reporters on Friday. 'In defence we are imperious – opponents have very few chances against us.

'Yes, recently we have scored a lot of goals, but that's because our players are so good. Our overall attacking game must get better.'

Bayern have opened up an eight-point gap at the top of the league, but it is their incredible goal difference of 53 which is perhaps most impressive.

Guardiola has been unrepentant in his demands ahead of two big matches - against Hannover in the league, before they host Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on March 11.

Despite their impressive results, Bayern have been told to improve in attacking areas by their manager

'The defensive behaviour of Hannover and Donetsk are completely different,' Guardiola continued. 'Thus, our attacking tactics will be different.

'We have to think first of this Bundesliga game - there are still 33 potential points to be won starting with Hannover. Wolfsburg are on our tail, just eight points behind us, we know that.

'We've had less time to prepare than Hannover, so we must engage full concentration. I will choose my strongest possible XI regardless of our game with Shakhtar coming up.'
