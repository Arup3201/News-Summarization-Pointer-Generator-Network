Claire Sharpe rang police and said her neighbour had stabbed her with a screwdriver

A woman launched a hate campaign against her neighbour and filmed everything she did following a row over parking.

Claire Sharpe, 33, fell out with Lisa Trumble, 47, shortly after Lisa moved next door in their cul-de-sac in Chippenham, Wiltshire.

The pair had a brief dispute about parking outside their homes but Sharpe then began accusing her of a series of crimes.

She rang police and claimed Lisa had stabbed her with a screwdriver and a set of keys.

She also alleged that Ms Trumble smashed into her with a car and used her keys to scratch her vehicle.

Police investigated all the allegations and dismissed them as lies and Sharpe was handed a harassment notice.

But she then began using a video camera to film Lisa day and night - often recording her thorough her kitchen window.

She set up a constant 'surveillance' of Lisa's front garden.

She filmed everyone who entered Ms Trumble's home for nearly eight weeks.

Now Sharpe has been given a restraining order by Chippenham Magistrates Court banning her from recording Lisa’s home address.

Lisa, 47, who fled Zimbabwe with her children in 2001, said problems began with a parking dispute.

She said: 'It has been a very unhappy nightmare.

'I’ve had so many different people knock on my door questioning me - that is really scary, even if you know you’ve done nothing wrong.

'It’s really difficult to cope.

'I am a quiet person, I don’t like conflict, I don’t understand why she’s doing it.

'Three
times she said I ran her over. It frightened me because I’d look out 
the window and see police looking underneath my car and your heart 
starts pounding.

The pair had a brief dispute about parking outside their homes but Sharpe then began accusing her neighbour of running her over

Sharpe's hate campaign - which included filming her neighbour - was triggered by a row over parking

'Once she phoned the police in front of me and said, ‘Help me, my neighbour’s stabbing me’ and they were out straight away.'

Nick Barr, prosecuting, told the court that police said all allegations against Lisa had been investigated and there was no substance to any of them.

He added: 'Miss Sharpe was issued with a harassment notice in February 2013 and within a short space of time that was breached by putting the camera at her

kitchen window directly pointing into Lisa Trumble’s garden, at whoever came to her front door.

'That caused some distress, as you would imagine.'

Terry McCarthy, defending, told the court: 'The reason she set up a camcorder was that she got an email from the police advising her if she was concerned about the behaviour of her neighbour then she should film it.

'It isn't appropriate to use this court to deal with a neighbours' dispute.'

But outside court, Sgt Connor said: 'People are given advice by the police to gather evidence of anti-social behaviour, but at no time has Miss Sharpe ever been told by us to set up a camera and continuously film her neighbour's private property.

'In fact she was given warnings by the police to remove it.

'With regards to making false and malicious allegations, not only can it cause a lot of distress, it is a criminal offence and we will pursue it.'
