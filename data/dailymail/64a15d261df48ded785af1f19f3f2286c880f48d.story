A woman who was crushed between two cars has spoken her shock at being hit by a stolen Volkswagen Golf as she was cleaning her own convertible in the drive of her home.  

Elena Berek suffered a broken leg and smashed pelvis in the crash - but she could have been much more badly injured as bricks from the garden wall flew towards her head.  

In the aftermath of the horrendous accident, she assumed that the driver would help her, but instead he tried to reverse the car and ended up running away.

Horror: Elena Berek was trapped between two cars after one of them was struck by a hit-and-run driver

Injuries: Ms Berek was forced to spend three weeks in hospital with a broken leg and pelvis

Recovery: The businesswoman now says she is lucky to be alive after the terrifying accident last month

Ms Berek, 46, was cleaning her Chrysler Crossfire outside her home in Coventry on a Sunday morning last month when she saw a black Golf heading towards her at 70mph. 

The car smashed through her garden wall and hurtled into another vehicle, which careered into Ms Berek so she had to be freed by firefighters.

'I can't quite believe how dramatic it was,' she said. 'One minute I was washing my car and the next thing I was completely trapped. It could have been fatal and I just can't believe I got out alive.  

'The driver was completely out of control. I was forced over the front of the bonnet and bricks from the garden wall came flying just over my head. The bricks missed me by just a few centimetres. I was so lucky.  

'I saw the driver from a sideways angle and hoped he was going to come and help me, but after he couldn't re-start the car, he turned and fled on foot.  

'It was an early Sunday morning so none of my neighbours were around to see it. I was jammed between the two cars and shaking like a leaf.' 

Drama: The incident was caught on camera by Ms Berek's brother Tony after she accidentally phoned him

Rescue: Firefighters pulled the victim out from between the two vehicles with the help of paramedics

Danger: Ms Berek says she was nearly killed by flying bricks after a stolen car crashed through the wall

Emergency services battled for an hour to free Ms Berek, in shocking scenes captured on camera by her brother Tony.  

She said: 'I was actually texting Tony at the time but the crash caused me to accidentally call him. All he could hear was my screaming and he rushed over within minutes.  

'I couldn't feel any pain at first but as soon as I was freed by the fire crews it all kicked in. It was a miracle I got out alive. I just remember screaming my lungs out for help.'  

Ms Berek's partner Maggie, 59, who runs a green energy firm with her, was inside their home at the time of the crash.  

'I was inside doing the ironing when I heard this huge explosion,' she said. 'All I could hear was Elena screaming my name.  

'At first I thought a bomb had gone off, it was terrifying but my only thought was to go to Elena. I ran outside and it was carnage - she was trapped between the two cars.'

Getting better: Ms Berek, who runs a green energy company, acknowledges she is lucky not to be worse hurt

Relief: 'I am trying to stay positive', says Ms Berek in the aftermath of her ordeal

The businesswoman has spent three weeks at Coventry's University Hospital recovering from a severely broken leg, fractured in three places, and a shattered pelvis.  

Police are still hunting for the motorist who apparently stole the Golf and then fled the scene of the accident - he is described as a white man in his early 20s with black hair.  

'It could have been so much worse so I am trying to stay positive about my injuries, but it is going to be at least six weeks before I can put any weight on my leg,' Ms Berek said.  

'The pictures my brother took are so dramatic and I can't believe they are real when I look at them.  

'I'm very lucky and everyone has been so helpful and rallied around me.'
