A man who took to stealing packages from a woman's doorstop in Washington DC this week got more than he bargained for - a box filled with dog feces.

Andrea Hutzler, 33, said she has lost more than $800 in stolen goods over the past two months, including Christmas presents, clothes and even aluminium poles she had ordered for a building project.

Hutzler and her boyfriend have filed police reports and installed a camera outside their home, but all these measures did nothing to stop thieves from lifting parcels from their doorstep.

Revenge's best served smelly: This suspected package thief in Washington DC had no idea he was walking into a stinky trap when he approached a house hoping to steal a package containing something valuable  

Pungent plot: What the man did not know is the homeowners, who had lost several parcels to sticky-fingered crooks over the past three months, filled this cardboard box with dog feces to teach him a lesson  

Candid camera: To make matters worse for the unwitting perpetrator, the residents trained a surveillance camera on the front door to catch him in the act and get a good look at his face 

For Hutzler the last straw was seeing a stranger approach her house at around 3pm last Friday and get away with yet another delivery.

‘I worked hard, saved my money, bought something and then it was just gone,’ the frustrated woman told ABC7.

So with less than two weeks to go before Christmas, Miss Hutzler has decided to teach the sticky-fingered Grinch who has been swiping her purchases what it means to be on her naughty list.

With some help from her two dogs, Miss Hutzler has come up the perfect, pungent revenge plot, filling a cardboard box with the pooches' excrement, reported MyFox Philly. 

On Monday, the crafty homeowner trained a video camera on her front door and set up the trap.

Before long, a man in a hooded sweatshirt and a beanie hat was caught on camera walking up the stairs, scooping up the special gift and fleeing.

The recording showing the heartless thief getting his comeuppance was posted on YouTube Monday and has since spread online.

Unforgettable lesson: Hutlzer, pictured here with her four-legged accomplice, hopes she won't be seeing the thief anytime soon 

Hutzler said that before recruiting her two dogs as her accomplices in her vendetta, she had planned to place a note inside the box stating: 'Surprise! Please stop stealing my crap.'

Hutzler has filed a police report and hopes detectives will be able to identify and collar the crook with the help of the surveillance video.

For now, she hopes that her stunt has sent the thief a clear message to stay away from her stuff.

‘I think he would be gone for good because he'll never know what I’ll be putting in a box,’ she said with a smile.
