Nine people who own the brand-new iPhone 6 Plus have already contacted Apple, upset about their warped devices, the tech giant said Thursday. 

Apple Inc went into damage control mode, addressing what has come to be known as 'BendGate' by claiming that costumers' complaints about iPhones warping are few and far between.

The statement from the tech giant came just hours after Apple pulled back a flawed software update.

'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and
through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers
have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus,' Apple
spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in an email.

'Much ado about nothing': The tech giant stated that with normal day-to-day use, a bend in iPhone 6 Plus is extremely rare 

Apple shares closed down nearly 4 per cent at $97.87 Thursday, wiping out nearly $23billion in market value. 

The new devices have faced criticism and widespread ridicule over their apparent bendability. Social media and online forums are overflowing with comments and memes poking fun at the phones' ability to bend when placed in back
pockets or while wearing skinny jeans.

Apple said its new batch of iPhones feature stainless steel and titanium
inserts to reinforce high-stress locations and use the strongest
glass in the smartphone industry.

The only way an iPhone may have bent is if someone put it in
their back pocket and sat on the phone for a very long time,
said Laban Roomes, chief executive of Goldgenie, which
customizes and gold-plates iPhones.

Apple was also forced to withdraw a glitch-ridden update to its
latest operating system after some users of its new phones
complained of call service disruptions.

'We apologize for the great inconvenience experienced by
users,' Muller said.

Apple said on its website it was working on an iOS update to
fix the issue, and will release it in the next few days. 

'I do believe this speaks to execution issues at Apple,"
said JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna. 'At the end of the day I
believe this too shall pass, but we are noting with concern that
the miscues pile up.'

Apple said on Monday it had shipped 10million units of
iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

Users of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus also complained about the
inability to use the fingerprint-reading Touch ID after updating
to iOS 8.0.1.

Some users had complained of 'sluggish Wi-Fi and dwindling
battery life' after moving to iOS 8, Time magazine reported
earlier this week. 

Earlier today, Apple issued a step-by-step guide for users to
reinstall iOS 8, launched last week, through the latest version
of iTunes. The health app will not work for now and will be
fixed in the next software update, the company said.

Customers might, however, hope for replacements for their
bent iPhones, depending on whether their devices passed an
inspection, tech news website The Next Web reported, quoting an
Apple support executive. 

Cases of bent iPhones 5 and 5s had been reported in 2013 by
Cult of Mac, a website that exclusively covers Apple.

Rival smartphone manufacturers wasted no time taking digs at Apple's woes.

A Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ad featured a bending phone against its own product, while
BlackBerry Ltd CEO John Chen said: 'I would challenge
you guys to bend our Passport.' 

Bend it like Dali: 'BendGate' has gone viral on social media, with Apple's critics poking fun at the new phones' apparent flexibility

The reason for the bend is due to the iPhone 6 Plus being made out of aluminium.

Aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so, if enough pressure is applied, it will bend and move.

According to iMore, no part of either of the new iPhones has more than a quarter of an inch (0.64cm) of aluminium in any spot.

This means that, in areas of the phones that are weakest, it’s possible it could be susceptible to bending.

This is noticeable in images, with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the SIM card slot.

These areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and SIM card, so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend.

To stop the phone bending, users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone.

For example, do not have it sideways in a pocket, as your pocket will push it against your leg, possibly causing bending.

Putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect, so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option.

Another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied.
