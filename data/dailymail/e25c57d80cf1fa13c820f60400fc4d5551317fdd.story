The owner of a travel agent whose cringeworthy promo video went viral has said she has had to cancel her annual leave due to a huge rise in demand.

Shona Thorne, manager of Scottish firm Thorne Travel, which has seen nearly 700,000 people view its cheesy online advert, said she has seen a 110 per cent increase in bookings.

Thorne, Kilwinning, North Ayrshire, said demand has been worldwide - including from across the UK and the US - since the video, dubbed 'so bad it's good', was published.

One of the stars of the video says the girls from Scotland are 'like Virgin Airways girls, only a bit more real'

The clip features staff strutting along the high street in tight-fitting dresses to a pumping club soundtrack, granting holiday wishes to locals with startling special effects.

Ms Thorne said the stars of the video looked 'like the Virgin Airways girls, only a bit bigger, with a bit more attitude, and a bit more real'.

After the success of the video, Ms Thorne told Mail Online; 'Bookings have increased by 110 per cent and I am not sure at this early stage if this is due a coincidence or due to the advert.

'We have had customers and people from the town popping in with flowers, cards and gifts saying how amazed they are with all the publicity our little town has got.

'We are so amazed that we are in Australian and New Zealand papers and [we have had] e-mails from people all over the world saying that they love the video; this shows travel agencies have definitely changed and moved with the times. 

'I’m meant to be on holiday and I had to come into the shop today because we were so busy.'

Bookings are not believed to be constrained to Scottish holidaymakers, with people from London and even the US using the firm.

In the video, the bevy of travel agents turn heads as they march through town in their pink frocks, hand on hips, twirling in slow-mo and clicking their fingers in a flurry of stardust.

Ms Thorne told MailOnline Travel: 'With our pink uniforms, we look a bit like the Virgin Airways girls, only a bit bigger, with a bit more attitude, and a bit more real.'

When planning the promotional video, Shona says they didn't want to use 'polished, size-six actresses'.

'It's a bit of a laugh,' she adds. 'It's supposed to be tongue in cheek.'

The advert, which features street dancers, amateurish special effects and a cruise ship 'captain' in an ill-fitting uniform went viral online after receiving an endorsement from Fr Ted creator Graham Linehan.

Thousands of users watched the video yesterday afternoon after Father Ted and The IT Crowd creator Graham Linehan tweeted the link, saying: 'After a year of Ebola, UKIP, gamergate and worse, WE HAVE FOUND OUR UNICORN CHASER'. 

One of the highlights of the video is the scene where a couple meet a cruise captain in ill-fitting uniform 

Within hours, it had been viewed almost 40,000 times on YouTube, and shared countless times on Facebook and Twitter, with one fan writing: 'All it's missing is Alan Partridge'.

The video features staff flouncing down the high street in Kilwinning against a soundtrack by Swedish House Mafia.

Various scenes show the travel agent employees transforming black and white scenes into colour.

In one toe-curling scene a bearded man appears as a cruise ship captain in a uniform three times too big for him and approaches an elderly couple looking though a brochure.

Christina Haywood, 20, assistant manager at the travel agency, said: 'We wanted to show our customers that we're quirky and like to have a laugh. So, we decided to make a video to show what we're all about.

Fr Ted creator Graham Linehan is a big fan of the three-minute promotional advertisement

'We are a travel agency that is different to everyone else. We do everything from bus trips to Blackpool to luxury holidays at the other end of the world. We just wanted to spread the word.

'Filming the video brilliant and a good laugh, but we didn't expect what was going to happen.

'We expected a few people to watch it but it's gone viral. It's been great.

'People have been sharing it across social media and we've even had comments from Australia.'

The promotional clip has proven exceptionally popular on social media.
