Hundreds of well-wishers today attended the funeral of a 94-year-old war hero who died without any close family.

Frederick Leach escaped death on numerous occasions during the Second World War and was honoured for his part in the Liberation of Norway.

But the war hero died on November 6 at Briarwood Care Home in Eston, Middlesbrough without any family living near him.

Respects: Hundreds of well-wishers attended the funeral of Frederick Leach, 94, today

Forces: Mr Leach's funeral at Teeside Crematorium was attended by former servicemen and members of the public alike

No close family: Mr Leach was private in B Company of the 1st Battalion, Green Howards, when they were pitted against the advancing Nazis in Norway, in 1940

However, after an appeal by Redcar and Cleveland Council, around 300 people arrived at Teesside Crematorium in Middlesbrough to pay their respects to the war veteran.

The funeral, which lasted around 45 minutes, was attended by members of the armed forces, veterans and standard bearers.

Jon Edwards, Minister of South Bank Baptist Church, where it is understood Fred once attended, took the service.

He said: 'Fred did not die alone, he was part of the Green Howards, a proud regiment that never forgets a comrade-in-arms.

'Fred did not die alone, because, most importantly, I believe that God was with him.'

Rev Edwards told how he had spoken to as many people as he could to build up a picture of Fred’s life.

He
said: 'Fred was a proud man. And I don’t mean proud as in arrogant or 
big-headed, proud as in dignified, proud as in having integrity.

'So
he was very proud of his military record, proud of the service that he 
had given to his country, proud to have served in the Green Howards.

'It
was not something that he spoke about a lot, it was not something he 
spoke about easily, and he certainly didn’t see himself as a hero.

'Those that didn’t come back, they were the real heroes,’ he used to say.'

Members of the general public also turned out to say goodbye to Mr Leach.

Around 100 well wishers stood outside listening to the service on loudspeaker.

One man who attended the service was 93-year-old Earnie Jackson from Liverton Mines, East Cleveland.

He said: 'We served at the same time but I wouldn’t be able to pick him out in a crowd. I joined up in 1935, four years before Fred.

'I served with him in Scampston near Malton in North Yorkshire. I did not know him well as he was sent to Catterick and I was sent to Richmond and then India.

'I came here to pay my respects 
because he was a Green Howard. It was a great service, especially with 
the crowd of people, I wasn’t expecting that many people so I was 
surprised.

'I think he would have been pleased with the turn out, it just seemed right and proper.

Dennis Grubb, 79, a standard bearer and president from the Royal Air Force Association was also in attendance.

The
70-year-old from Stockton-on-Tees said: 'We always try to do our best 
to attend all of the military funerals around here, even the lads from  Afghanistan, we try to get to as many as possible.

'The reason being if it wasn’t for these lads we wouldn’t be here today.

'I
thought it was an absolutely brilliant turn out from everyone in the 
community and to have 19 standard bearers there was fantastic too.'

Sheelagh Clarke, cabinet member for health and social wellbeing at Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council, said: 'We appealed for relatives and anyone who knew Fred to come forward.

'The
response from the public and the Armed Forces community was truly 
heart-warming, as was today’s service. Fred got the send-off he 
deserved.'

Armed forces organisations and 
members of the public responded in their hundreds when the news of 
Dambusters Veteran Harold Jellicoe Percival's death was made public. 

Mr Percival, 99, died alone and with no close family at a nursing home in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.

After his story gained national attention, his funeral on Armistice Day was attended by hundreds of strangers.

One the day, undertaker Eddie Jacobs 
said: ‘This was a man with only a couple of very distant relatives going
to his last resting place alone. The British people responded like only
the British can.’

Mr Leach was a private in B Company of the 1st Battalion, Green Howards, when they were pitted against the advancing Nazis in Norway, in 1940.

On April 28, near the town of Otta, the battalion was attacked by about 200 Stuka dive bombers.Speaking in 2005 to a local newspaper, Frederick told how he remembered being by a shallow dugout on a hill-top when the planes attacked.

A comrade jumped into the dugout, leaving Frederick outside, with only the thickness of his greatcoat to save him from the flying bomb splinters.

Despite being heavily outnumbered and almost hopelessly out-gunned the Green Howards held their line against the Germans.

Mr Leach was the last surviving Green Howard from the battle when he was invited to meet King Harald, of Norway, on the 60th anniversary of the country’s liberation.

The Duke of Edinburgh was also in attendance at the formal event in Buckingham Palace that required the other guests to wear a lounge suit while Mr Leach was granted special dispensation to proudly wear his Green Howards blazer.
