Nelson Mandela will battle to recover from his life-threatening lung infection, a close friend believes.

The comments from his lawyer, George Bizos, came as Mr Mandela spent his second night in hospital.

He believes the 94-year-old is determined ‘to keep on going’ despite suffering a long history of illness.

Ailing health: Nelson Mandela has been re-admitted to hospital with a recurrence of a lung infection, the South African government announced today

'Having best possible treatment: Mr Mandela (pictured with his family celebrating his 93rd birthday) was taken into hospital shortly before midnight, according to South African President Jacob Zuma

Mr Zuma said Mr Mandela was doing 'very well' and said he was hoping to visit him in hospital as soon as possible

The anti-apartheid hero was admitted to 
hospital late Wednesday night, prompting South African president Jacob 
Zuma to call on the nation to prepare itself for the worst.

But Mr Bizos said: 'It's a matter one doesn't have to discuss. I am 84 – every one of us wants to keep on going.

'I think that he has always had 
confidence in members of the (health) profession and he has the love and
care of (his wife) Graca and members of his family and a few of his 
friends that go to him from time to time. I think he enjoys that and 
would like to continue.'

The South African government today said Mr Mandela was in good spirits and making 'steady progress'.

Mr Bizos, who defended Mr Mandela 
during his 1960s treason trial told The Daily Telegraph he was planning 
to visit his friend – either in hospital or at his home if he is 
discharged – 'in the next day or so'.

Mr Zuma said South Africans should be realistic about the prognosis because of Mr Mandela’s age.

‘In Zulu, when someone passes away 
who is very old, people say he or she has gone home. I think those are 
some of the things we should be thinking about,’ Mr Zuma said.

It is the fourth time in just over two years that the increasingly frail Mr Mandela has been admitted to hospital.

Mr Zuma said Mr Mandela was doing ‘very well’ and said he was hoping to visit him in hospital as soon as possible.

But a family member said: 'He is very poorly. This (situation) is very worrying.'

Zuma had yesterday called for the 'world to pray for our beloved Madiba', making reference to his clan name.

Fondly referring to the Nobel Peace 
Prize laureate by his clan name, he said: ‘We appeal to the people of 
South Africa and the world to pray for our beloved Madiba and his family
and to keep them in their thoughts.

‘We have full confidence in the medical team and know that they will do everything possible to ensure recovery.’

The governing African National Congress called for prayers for Mr Mandela, as did US President Barack Obama.

Mr Zuma’s office said Mr Mandela was 
conscious and ‘responding positively’ to treatment but did not reveal 
where he is being treated.

Spokesman Mac Maharaj later added: ‘I think 
we need to be clear that the doctors are attending to Madiba on a 
continuous basis.

They prefer to act on the side of caution, and the 
moment they felt there was a recurrence of the lung infection, they felt
that it warranted immediate hospitalisation given his age and given his
history.’

Mr Mandela, who became South Africa’s
first black president in 1994, has been in and out of hospital for the 
past few months. He spent 18 days on a ward in December undergoing 
treatment for the lung infection and gallstones surgery.

It was his longest stay in hospital 
since 1990, when he was released from  prison after serving 27 years for
conspiring to overthrow the white-minority apartheid government.

But he has been frail and in poor 
health for several years. It is believed his lung infection stems from a
bout of tuberculosis he contracted in the 1980s while working in a 
prison quarry at the Robben Island jail.

Mr Mandela spent much of last year in Qunu, his ancestral village in the poor Eastern Cape province.

But since his release from hospital 
in December he has been at his home in an affluent Johannesburg suburb, 
close to sophisticated medical care.

Earlier this month he underwent medical tests.

Fondly called the ‘father of the nation’, Mr Mandela has been mostly absent from the political scene for the past decade.

But he remains an enduring symbol of the struggle against racism.
