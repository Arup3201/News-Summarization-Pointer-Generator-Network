They will certainly be treated to stunning scenes of Cornwall, but viewers may not hear a Cornish accent when they tune in to watch Poldark.

Yesterday it emerged that the stars of the show, which is set in the windswept Cornish landscape, were so terrified of being accused of mumbling that many made a conscious decision to enunciate their lines.

It appears that the barrage of criticism received over the BBC’s adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s gothic novel Jamaica Inn is to blame for creating the fear factor.

More than 2,000 viewers complained about poor sound quality and inaudible dialogue when Jamaica Inn was screened last April and the star of Poldark, Aidan Turner, has now confessed that he and the cast were alarmed by the backlash.

Turner, 31, told the Radio Times: ‘I didn’t see Jamaica Inn but the fuss about it spooked us all a lot.

‘We started shooting a few weeks later and I can tell you all the actors were aiming for ten out of ten on enunciation. 

'I’m doing posh RP [received pronunciation] anyway, so it didn’t affect me directly but I was scared, yes.’

Turner takes the role of British soldier Ross Poldark, who returns from fighting in the American War of Independence to find his fiancée Elizabeth Chenoweth, believing him to be dead, is set to marry his cousin.

BBC bosses are hoping for a return of Poldark mania. 

Poldark is based on the novels by Winston Graham.

When it was first dramatised in the 1970s, up to 15million viewers per episode tuned in to follow its passionate romances and tales of smuggling. 

Poldark begins on BBC1 on Sunday at 9pm.
