Americans have rejected the chance of enjoying a cappuccino flavoured potato chip and instead chose the more exotic wasabi ginger option. 

Frito-Lay, who are owned by Pepsi, launched the Do Us A Flavor promotion where one million people got the chance to vote for a new type of chip.

Customers got a chance to vote for their favourite option after the four new varieties, including Mango Salsa, Cheddar Bacon Mac and Cheese, entered shops in July. 

The company ran the competition over the summer trying to determine the most popular new flavoured chip

America has chosen a potato chip flavoured with Wasabi paste rather than one made from cappuccino

Last year Cheesy Garlic Bread won the competition and is still available in the shops. 

The inspiration behind the the winning option will receive either $1 million in prize money or a percentage of the flavour's annual sales - whichever is greater.

Ram Krishnan, Frito-Lay's chief marketing officer, said this year's winner is evidence Americans want more ethnic flavors, even though the top four Lay's flavors remain Original, Barbecue, Cheddar & Sour Cream and Sour Cream & Onion. 

He said he couldn't have imagined Lay's selling a Wasabi Ginger flavor when he joined the company eight years ago.

He said: 'We're kind of getting into a new flavour territory. When I went to school, Mexican food was exotic.

Some comments on Lay's Facebook page described the cappuccino option as 'nasty' and 'gross'. 

The contest began in the United Kingdom, where Frito-Lay sells chips under the Walkers brand. Since then, it was launched in 14 countries before coming to the U.S. last year. 

Winning flavors in other countries include Pizza in Saudi Arabia, Shrimp in Egypt, Sunday Roast in New Zealand, Pickled Cucumber in Serbia and Aline's Caesar Salad in Australia.

Given its success, Krishnan said the company is looking to launch the contest in other countries as well.
