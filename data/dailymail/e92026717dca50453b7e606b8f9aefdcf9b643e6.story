A Romanian woman detained by immigration officers yesterday told police she had come to the UK looking for free medical treatment on the NHS.

Daniella was one of a group of around a dozen rough sleepers who were detained when police and UK border agents raided their makeshift camp in central London.

As she was led away, brandishing a plastic bag full of NHS medicines and papers, she said: 'I'm from Romania, I came for the hospital. I have asthma and angina.'

The wealthy area around Marble Arch 
and Park Lane has become the frontline of the running battle between 
immigration officials and Eastern European migrants who sleep on the 
streets and beg or steal for a living.

Last
 night officials said those found to have entered the UK illegally would
 be returned home and banned from re-entering for a year.

The number of immigrants coming to 
Britain from Romania and Bulgaria is expected to rise after restrictions
 on their ability to work were lifted by the Government yesterday.

However, citizens of the EU who do not have a job and cannot support themselves are not allowed to live in Britain - meaning that officials can deport those who are unemployed and sleeping rough.

During
 today's raid, border officials searched, fingerprinted and photographed
 around a dozen beggars, before taking them away in three Home Office 
vans.

As of yesterday, citizens of Romania and Bulgaria have the unrestricted right to work and study in the UK.

The new rules are expected to attract tens of thousands of new immigrants to Britain, where the average wage is much higher than in the Eastern European countries.

However, they are not designed to benefit the beggars and rough sleepers who have been plaguing areas such as Marble Arch.

Prospective immigrants must prove they are able to support themselves and their families, meaning that the homeless or unemployed can be deported and sent home.

If they are found to be living in Britain illegally, they are banned from returning to the country within the next 12 months.

The immigrants, who could speak only broken English, are expected to be offered free flights home from Britain.

Local businesses have long complained of homeless migrants turning one of Britain's most prestigious addresses into a form of shanty town.

Luiga Rapuano, who has worked as a hairdresser in the area for 25 years, said: 'This used to be the most exclusive part of London, it's the most expensive place to buy on the Monopoly board, and now it's looking more like a third-world country.

'It's been going on for nearly two years now and we are definitely seeing less customers as a result. Whenever I come to work they are sleeping outside the shop, I have to climb over them to get in.

'During the night they urinate in the 
plant pots and outside the shop. The smell is horrific, and then there 
are the fag butts, loads of them.

'I wouldn't mind if they came over and tried to get jobs, but they don't, they steal and beg.'

Manpower: The Border Agency deployed dozens of officers to the scene

Targets: Roma beggars have been accused of ruining the exclusive area with their behaviour

Offer: The immigrants who were rounded up are likely to be given free flights home to Romania

A local restaurateur added: 'A few months ago there would be a group of 10 of them coming in every day. Theft would go up - pick-pocketing, bag theft, you name it.

'The police and the council seem to be doing more now, we have not had any trouble for a while, but it's a constant game of cat and mouse. The police move them away, and the next day they are back.'

Councillor Nickie Aiken said: 
'Residents and businesses in Westminster are all too aware of the 
anti-social behaviour that comes with persistent beggars sleeping on our
 streets.

'Tackling 
the associated hygiene issues alone costs our council-tax payers around 
Â£500,000 every year and, for many months, Westminster City Council has 
warned that the problems we are experiencing now have the potential to 
worsen and spread across the country.'

Suspicion: Officers took down the Romanians' details as they conducted an immigration investigation

Leading away: Police are cracking down on Roma beggars in the wake of high-profile debates about immigration from Romania and Bulgaria

Operation: The Home Office is working with local councils to reduce the impact of begging

And earlier this week, council leader Philippa Roe accused jobless immigrants of defecating on residents' doorsteps as she called for further action against anti-social behaviour in the area.

Romanian migrants detained at Marble Arch today will be banned from returning to Britain for a year if they are found to be here illegally, according to a Home Office spokesman.

'This is part of our regular enforcement activity, which takes place across the country on a daily basis,' she said.

'When those with no permission to be in the UK refuse to return home voluntarily we will take action to remove them.'
