A third of Italians think it would be better for their country to return to the lira, a poll has revealed today.

The survey, published in the Corriere della Sella, also said 65 per cent of those polled thought the introduction of the single currency had been more damaging than beneficial for the Italian economy.

And confidence in the European Union stands at its lowest level in many years - just 51 per cent.

Step backwards? A third of Italians would prefer to ditch the euro and return to using the lira

Confidence: Nine eurozone countries had their credit ratings downgraded by Standard & Poor's on Friday as the European debt crisis continues

The poll, by ISPO, highlights growing concerns over the future of the single currency among Italians as the eurozone's third largest economy struggles with a spreading debt crisis that has pushed its borrowing costs to unsustainable levels.

The technocrat government of Prime Minister Mario Monti, appointed in November, has pushed through a painful austerity budget including tax hikes and spending cuts that are hitting Italians hard.

Mr Monti's approval rating rose to 56 per cent from 46 per cent a month ago, the survey showed, as the Italian economy heads towards recession.

Some 31 per cent said they would prefer a return to the lira, although 60 per cent said Italy had had to join the euro and there was no going back.

Italy, who debt-to-GDP ratio is second worst only to Greece at 120 per cent, was among a raft of European countries hit by a mass downgrade from Standard & Poor's on Friday.

Its sovereign rating was cut by two notches to BBB+.

It comes as French President Nicolas Sarkozy secured a small boost for his country's economy after Moody's rating agency maintained its triple A rating.

Just days after rival Standard and Poor's downgraded the country's debt over concerns about Europe's ability to handle the crisis, the markets appeared to brush off the decision to cut ratings in nine countries.

The downgrades were expected, but they served as a reminder that the 17 countries in the euro zone have a long way to deal with the debt crisis.

Mr Sarkozy, who is campaigning ahead of the presidential election in April, travelled to Spain today.

During a visit with Spanish King Juan Carlos, he said: 'Spain and France have a lot to do so that Europe can get out of the repeated crises that it has been in for the last three years.'

In its announcement, Moody's cited the French economy's overall strength but said bleak growth prospects presented 'risks to the French government's fiscal consolidation plans'.

It said: 'France, like other eurozone sovereigns, may face a number of challenges in the coming months.

'The need to provide additional support to other European sovereigns or to its own banking system cannot be excluded. In that case this could give rise to significant new (contingent) liabilities for the government's balance sheet.'

At the same time, MPs in Germany warned that the euro zone bailout fund's volume must be maintained and countries downgraded by S&P should have to provide more guarantees to preserve its triple A status.

Austerity: Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti's government has pushed through tax hikes and spending cuts, but he has increased his popularity

Michael Meister, deputy leader of the conservatives in the Bundestag, said: 'The total volume of the EFSF must be maintained.

'Germany was not downgraded so our contribution should not be changed. Countries that were affected must contribute more to the guarantees.'

Greece is gearing up for another tough week of negotiations on the country's crucial second bailout as it tries to revive talks with private investors.

Government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis said: 'This is a crucial time for the Greek economy... the negotiations are very difficult.

'It is understood that there will be renewed pressure (from the debt inspectors) to speed up structural reforms.'

International debt inspectors from the so-called 'troika' - the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission - are expected to arrive in Athens on Friday.

An integral part of the €130billion second bailout is a bond swap deal with private creditors that is crucial to avoid a devastating default.

Those talks appeared close to collapse on Friday amid disagreements over the interest rates of new bonds. They are likely to resume this week.

Known as the Private Sector Involvement, or PSI, the talks aim to reduce Greece's debt by €100billion by swapping creditors' bonds with new ones with a 50 per cent lower face value.

Without it, the country could suffer a catastrophic bankruptcy that would send shock waves through the global economy.

Last week, the European Central Bank stepped up its purchases of government bonds to €3.8billion, a tool that has helped keep indebted eurozone goverments from financial collapse.

The news saw the markets give mixed reactions today. The FTSE was up 0.43 per cent at 5,660.78 this afternoon while the DOW fell 0.39 per cent.
