Accused: Kurtis Green was reported to the police after connecting a water supply to a war memorial in Dersingham, Norfolk, without permission

A teenager who was questioned by police after a council accused him of connecting a water supply to a war memorial without permission - will not face prosecution.

Kurtis Green, 19, and a 65-year-old man were reported to the police by Dersingham
Parish Council, in Norfolk, after allegedly carrying out the work without its consent.

The teenager - who has tended to the memorial unpaid for 12 years - was questioned by officers for two hours at Hunstanton police station and 
told that he had been accused of theft and causing criminal 
damage.

Norfolk Police put out a statement last week, saying that the matter was being considered by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

But a spokeswoman said today that the file on the case was not going to be handed to the CPS after all.

She said: 'Officers have spoken to everyone involved and the circumstances are now being considered.

'Police are aware of Kurtis’s efforts in cleaning up the memorial and we will work with all concerned to try to reach an acceptable resolution.”

Mr Green's father, Keith, 69, who owns a fish and chip shop in the town opposite the memorial, said he was relieved his son will not face prosecution.

'How could he have been prosecuted for a crime that he did not commit. There was no criminal damage or theft,' he said. 'The way Kurtis has been treated is absolutely revolting.'

Mr Green got into trouble in February when he connected a new pipe so the flower beds could be safely watered.

He
and fellow villager John Houston, 65, assumed they were authorised to 
do the work because the pipes for the water supply had already been 
placed in the ground as part of the restoration project.

But
Dersingham Parish Council complained to the police that they had done 
the work without its permission and accused them of criminal damage and 
theft.

After: The police now say that Mr Green will not face prosecution. The decision follows a public outcry about his treatment. He tended the memorial opposite his parents' fish and chip shop for free

Before: How the memorial looked before the teenager spent his spare time looking after it

In January, the Queen congratulated the 
teenager for his hard work in revamping the memorial, near her 
Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. He was just seven when he started tending
the garden around the structure.

He saved up his pocket money to buy 
gardening tools, and over the past decade he has spent hundreds of hours
working on his pride and joy.

When he was 15, he persuaded 
councillors to spend £20,000 on restoring the area with raised flower 
beds, new railings, seating and block paving.

Mr Green worked tirelessly to help with the project and won a Young People of the Year award after he was praised by villagers.

His
efforts were then recognised by the Queen in a letter after the local 
Royal British Legion won a prize for having Norfolk’s most improved war 
memorial.

Parish council clerk Sarah Bristow said last week that 
she could not comment as the issue was being investigated by  the 
police, but added: ‘The parish council did not give anyone permission to
do anything.’

The council was unavailable for comment today.
