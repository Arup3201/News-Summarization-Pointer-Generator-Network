Former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser has spoken of his political rival Gough Whitlam in the wake of his death on Tuesday morning at the age of 98.

Mr Fraser said his predecessor Mr Whitlam carried neither sadness nor bitterness in his heart. 

Despite their political differences Mr Fraser came to value his friendship in the years after the Whitlam government was dismissed by Governor-General John Kerr in 1975, leaving the coalition to take over.

'He was far too big a man to carry any bitterness or sadness in his heart,' Mr Fraser told ABC radio on Tuesday.

'While Gough turned his antagonism, if you like, on certain people he never seemed to me to bear any personal animosity.

'We met occasionally at international forums and little by little the ice seemed to break between us and we did establish a rapport, I suppose, friendship.'

Mr Fraser said Australia today was a much richer place in the wake of Mr Whitlam, whose government abolished the last remnants of the White Australia Policy, established relations with China, recognised Indigenous land rights and created Medibank.

'He was enormously, I believe, proud of Australia and the role Australia could play in the world,' Mr Fraser told ABC radio.

'He wanted this to be an independent country, not subject to anyone else or to any other country.

'He had aspirations probably too large for our immediate resources but aspirations that I think touched the hearts and minds of a great many Australians.

'He certainly left an indelible mark on Australian history.'

Mr Fraser also spoke to Sky News later on Tuesday morning, to pay tribute to the 'quick-witted and able' man whose 'policies touched people one way or another'.

'He was only in power a short time but he changed the labor party in dramatic way', Mr Fraser said.

'He had a vision of Australia as an independent country.'

The former Liberal prime minister also spoke of how Mr Whitlam 'opened the door' to relations with China before America, and how respected how much was attempted by his government in a short space of time.

'He will certainly go down in history as one of the most significant people in Australian public life', Mr Fraser said.

'Gough's legacy is going to be remembered as a high point in Australian life forever.' 

In a press conference, Mr Fraser reiterated his affection for his former political rival and paid tribute to his tenacity as a leader.

'I'll remember Gough as having a sense of Australian identity, a sense of Australia's purpose as a nation not as an appendage to other nations.'

Describing him as 'large, larger than life' Mr Fraser said Mr Whitlam was a family man who loved his late wife Margaret and children dearly.

When asked what politicians today could learn from his era, Mr Fraser made a strong point of the importance of maintaining Australia's independence.

'Australia should be Australia, we are not a plaything for another country'.

'We stand for what we believe not for something someone else tells us to believe,' Mr Fraser said, adding he believes it's something the country has lost over the year.
