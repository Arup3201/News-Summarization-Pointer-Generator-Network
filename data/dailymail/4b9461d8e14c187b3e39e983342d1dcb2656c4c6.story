Been to the pub for a couple and think you'll be OK to drive home? One look in this mirror should convince you otherwise.

This is the Government's shocking new ad campaign to deter drink drivers.

In the terrifying footage unsuspecting men are shown looking into the mirror while they wash their hands in a north London pub toilet.

Advert: The footage shows a man washing his hands in a north London pub toilet

Scare: Suddenly a mannequin is thrown at the mirror from the opposite side at full force

Shocking: The mannequin's lifeless face can be seen through the cracked mirror as 'blood' runs down into the sink

Suddenly a mannequin is thrown forcefully against the mirror from the other side - simulating the effect of a pedestrian hitting the windscreen in a car crash.

The impact caused the mirror to crack and 'blood' to run down the frame into the sink.

The video closes with footage of the horrified men ducking away from the mirror. All appear traumatised by the experience.

Advertising agency Leo Burnett created
 the video for THINK!, the Government's road-safety campaign run by the 
Department of Transport.

They launched the advert two days ago with the hashtag #publooshocker, hoping the footage would go viral.

The video has already received nearly 2million combined views on the advertising agency and THINK!'s YouTube pages.

Deterrent: This man is terrified as the mannequin hits the mirror. It is designed to simulate a car crash

Campaign: The footage of terrified pub-goers is designed to deter drink drivers

Warning: Drink driving incidents still account for 15 per cent of all deaths on the roads

Although the number of casualties caused by drink driving have dropped dramatically in the last 30 years it is still the cause of 15 per cent of all road deaths.

In 2011, 280 people died in the UK in drink driving incidents.

Anyone caught drink driving risks a fine of up to Â£5,000, a minimum 12-month driving ban and a criminal record.
