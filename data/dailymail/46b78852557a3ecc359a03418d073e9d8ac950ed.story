A 10-week-old poodle puppy nearly died this week after being thrown out with the trash.

The apricot puddle nicknamed Gem was found in a plastic bag that turned up at a recycling sorting plant in San Francisco on Friday.

Le Ellis Brown of animal control told KGO-TV that the bag was 'picked up by a Recology employee, driven around and more trash collected inside the back of the truck, transferred to the transfer facility, dumped down a chute, which went into a conveyer belt where the sorting took place and out on the sorting table on the conveyer belt comes this precious little gem.'

Tough little girl: Gem, a 10-week-old poodle puppy, survived being thrown out with the trash when workers found her in a plastic bag that turned up at a San Francisco recycling plant

Poor puppy: Gem was discovered with bite marks on her neck, lameness in her hind legs and discharge coming out of her ears. Animal control believes the injuries happened before she was thrown out

Getting better: Now in the safety of animal control, Gem is expected to make a full recovery but will need a few weeks to heal before she can be placed in a new home

Mr Brown told KPIX that's how Gem got her name - because she was like finding a diamond in the rough.

Despite her dangerous journey, Gem was found conscious and alert.

She had bike marks on her neck, lameness in her hind legs, and a discharge coming from her ears but official believe most of her injuries happened before being thrown away.

Now in the safety of animal control, veterinarians believe she will make a full recovery.

Who did this? Recycling officials are currently trying to figure out which part of the city Gem originated from

Lost and found: Gem ended up at this recycling facility in San Francisco

Ready for a new family: There's already a waiting list of families who want to adopt Gem

Officials at the Recology plant and animal control are now trying to determine what part of the city Gem came from in an attempt to find whose responsible for her abhorrent treatment.

'We're just looking for answers,' Mr Brown said. 'I've been here for 17 years. This is a first.'

Animal control says it will take a few more weeks for Gem to heal from her injuries at which point she can be placed at a new home.

There's already a waiting list of families looking to adopt her.
