Tim Howard remembers the moment he peered out into a filthy grey Mancunian day and saw a gifted young novice blossoming into a superstar.

It was in the autumn of 2003 and training had finished at Manchester United’s Carrington base. Most of Sir Alex Ferguson’s squad had headed for sanctuary but Cristiano Ronaldo remained out in the elements, running with a ball at his feet, practicing and refining his repertoire of tricks.

Ronaldo may divide opinion for such things as appearing on the front of Vanity Fair, the manicured good looks, the rippling torso and a perceived desire to be the centre of attention but one thing beyond question is his current standing as the best footballer in the world.

Friends reunited: Tim Howard will come up against former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo when Portugal take on the United States at the World Cup on Sunday night

Must win: Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal need to beat the US after their humiliation by Germany in the opening game

As Everton goalkeeper Howard explains, that tag is only possible because of the relentless work he used to put in a decade ago when the pair – who will look horns on Sunday night when the United States and Portugal square up in Manaus – had made their respective moves to Old Trafford.

‘From day one he had the flash and the flare but there was always something there and his work ethic was second to none, it really was,’ Howard explains. ‘That is the one thing I tell everyone who is around him.

'Everyone sees the underwear commercials, the girlfriends and the cars but, trust me, his work ethic is incredible. On the ball, in the gym, eating the right food. You know, I just remember every day after training it was always the same.

‘Carrington is so big, there are acres and acres, so the perimeter is massive. But he would just go out after training and dribble the ball in the rain – doing his step-overs, the ‘Cruyff’ turns, all the things you see on television. He hadn’t honed his free-kick (style) back then, that came later.

‘But he’d run with the ball at his feet around whole the perimeter, working on his own. It is no secret then. It is no surprise that this is how he has ended up. Not everyone does that. He is incredible.’

Yet he is also on the brink of elimination. This maybe an outstanding World Cup but another of its headline acts is in grave danger of leaving the party early and Ronaldo will be eliminated if Portugal lose to the USA and Germany beat Ghana.

Ronaldo looked helpless as Portugal were pummelled 4-0 by Germany in their opening game and there no doubt the feisty Americans, who are thriving under the guidance of one-time World Cup winner Jurgen Klinsmann, have the capabilities to take advantage of any lingering hangover.

Some would have anticipated the USA struggling in such a demanding group but preparations under Klinsmann have been meticulous and Howard says the challenge of trying to emerge from what was dubbed a group of death is both invigorating and inspirational.

Probable line-ups

‘I think this is what you want from a 
World Cup, isn’t it? It’s a proper group,’ said Howard. ‘If you qualify 
for a World Cup and expect to get an easy group, you are in the wrong 
sport. It doesn’t work like that.

‘The USA, have got to play 100 per cent, for three perfect games, to get out of the group. If you are in Group A or Group H, it doesn’t matter. Expectations are high now, soccer is so much more popular in America and the fan base has got more cult like.

‘You used to have the casual fans and now each team has their ultras, different groups and different fan bases. With that the expectation on the national team has grown. We have gotten better players; we have Jurgen Klinsmann as coach

‘Our best ever result was reaching the quarter-finals in 2002 and only just losing 1-0 to Germany, so that's the benchmark. But Jurgen has so many different ideas about the game on and off the field, from having our own chef, to travel, everything. He’s made everything ten times better.
