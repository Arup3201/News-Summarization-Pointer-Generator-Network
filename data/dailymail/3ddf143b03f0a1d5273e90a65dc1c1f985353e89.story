England Rugby 2015 have marked a year to go until the World Cup by making Prince Harry their honorary president.

The prince, a keen rugby fan, participated in a photo call with former World Cup-winning fly-half Jonny Wilkinson at Rugby School, the birthplace of the sport, to promote next year’s tournament.

Prince Harry played wheelchair rugby alongside Zara Phillips at the Invictus Games last week, and England Rugby 2015 chief executive Debbie Jevans said of his appointment.

‘With one year to go to the tournament, we are delighted to announce that Prince Harry has agreed to be our honorary president,' Jevans said.

‘The prince is a great rugby fan and recently inspired us all with the Invictus Games.

‘We have no doubt that he will help us achieve our aim of staging a tournament that reaches out to new and existing rugby fans.’
