As the Germany players celebrated their World Cup victory, their WAGs could not resist joining the on-field party at the Maracana.

A host of wives and girlfriends took to the pitch in Rio de Janeiro to congratulate their partners after they came out on top in the biggest, most important match of their lives.

Andre Schurrle was certainly glad of the presence of girlfriend Montana Yorke as he wept into her arms. He later said: 'This is the best moment of my life. I had to cry because I was so overcome. I couldn't stop it.'

Lena 
Gercke, girlfriend of Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira, suffered 
early disappointment when her boyfriend was forced to pull out of 
Germany's starting XI after injuring himself in the warm-up.

But it was better news for Sarah Brander, girlfriend of Bastian Schweinsteiger, and Mandy Capristo, partner of Arsenal man Mesut Ozil, as both midfielders started the showpiece final.

Mats Hummels' girlfriend Cathy Fischer was also spotted cheering on the Borussia Dortmund defender for the final time in Brazil.

Ann-Kathrin Brommel and Yorke, 
the girlfriends of Mario Gotze and Schurrle respectively, were forced to wait for their men to enter the fray from the substitutes' bench.

But when they did, they made it count.

Schurrle's assist found Gotze in the 113th minute who, instinctively, slotted it home to make it 1-0 and won the match for Germany.
