Former England striker Rodney Marsh says he would pay £100million for Harry Kane and backed the Tottenham striker to have a better career than Alan Shearer.

Kane, 21, has scored 29 goals in all competitions for Spurs this season and speaking to talkSPORT, Marsh explained that he would pay the incredible sum for the player if he was a chairman.

'I reckon he is worth £100million, I honestly do,' Marsh said. 'If I was a chairman of a football club, that is what I would pay for Harry Kane. I think he is going to go on and be a bigger and better player than Alan Shearer.'

Harry Kane's form in the Premier League makes him worth £100million, according to Rodney Marsh

Marsh, who played for England during his own career, said he would pay the fee if he was a chairman

Kane marked his first England appearance with a goal against Lithuania in the 4-0 win on Friday 

Marsh justified his belief by comparing Kane to other players who have joined the Premier League for big fees and are yet to match his form.

'Manchester City paid £32million for a relatively untried young player called Eliaquim Mangala. If Mangala is worth £32million, Harry Kane is worth £100million all day long,' Marsh explained.

'Angel di Maria cost Manchester United £60million. I think Harry Kane is a much better player than Di Maria in the Premier League,' Marsh added.

Kane marked his England debut with a goal 79 seconds after replacing Wayne Rooney against Lithuania on Friday.

And the Tottenham man could make his first England start when the Three Lions take on Italy in a friendly in Turin on Tuesday.
